467184,1,6302451787,"This is yet another disappointing modern French film that evokes few laughs, if any.  One is alerted that this is certainly no children's film as ""Baxter"" opens up with one of its many grotesque sex scenes.  One other reviewer stated, ""Anyone who truly loves bull terriers should not buy this movie"".  Indeed, this beautiful, well-trained little dog seems to be the victim of real physical abuse near the film's end.  We see him wince in various scenes as he is hit by various thrown objects, kicked, and even whipped.  Any dog lover should find this disturbing and unnecessary.  The boy who eventually winds up with Baxter becomes obsessed with Adolf Hitler and is thereafter portrayed as a sadistic introvert who wonders if he'll ever find a human ""like him, who doesn't feel love or fear"".  **SPOILER**  He becomes meaner as the movie progresses and comes to abuse and finally kill the dog.  This portrayal as metaphor is bewildering when one considers that Hitler was himself an avid animal lover and vegetarian, not to mention that one of the first countries in the world to enact animal rights laws was National Socialist Germany.  The only positive thing to be said about this film is its mercifully short length.",992908800,9,1220,4.85024154589372
467185,5,6302451787,"Unusual French film (subtitled) about an emotionally scarred Bull Terrier who acts out his aggressions and frustrations in the same inappropriate  ways that humans do. Story is effectively told from the doggie's warped  POV, both mentally and cinematically, and gives us a unique view into how  our pets might just hate us, as well as themselves. High marks for the  scene in which Baxter stalks and plots to kill his owners' newborn which  has taken his place in their affections. ""Benji"" this is not.",967939200,5,502,4.928571428571429
467186,5,6302451787,"Someone once told me they rented Baxter in the children's section of a video shop.  It was sandwiched in between the other talking dog movies.  This was either a terrible mistake, or a vicious little prank on the part  of a stressed-out video shop worker.
Baxter is a very nasty black comedy  about a very nasty but obedient dog.  Baxter finally meets his demise at  the hands of someone more evil than himself:  a psychotic little boy who  thinks he's Hitler.
Be on the lookout for hilarious bits of monologue,  like the section where Baxter is shagging a woman's leg.  Who'd have  thought that's what was going through a dog's mind at the time?",961113600,5,646,4.578947368421052
467187,5,6302451787,This is a terrific movie.  Remember: never be obedient! Especially when people do things like stand 1 inch away from you inthe grocery line because they're in a hurry.  Or because they are more important than the next person.  Watch the movie and learn.  Why don't people stop whining and taking everything out on others and start learning from their life?  Baxter was jes' a little ole puppy dog so he wasn't that smart.  Are you? ...Most people are blind and obedient? I agree.,958435200,3,479,4.642857142857143
467188,5,6302451787,"yes, this is black comedy to those only looking on the surface. there is more of baxter in all of us than we'd like to admit. this is more than a story of a dog; its a commentary on the human condition. we all try to get  through this world doing our own thing but all the while being loved.for  the record the final line is"" NEVER BE OBEDIENT"". his blind  obedience is what gets him killed.for those with an open mind this is a  must watch.enjoy.",956448000,7,447,4.103448275862069
467189,5,6302451787,"Although I like dogs, and the ending scene is quite brutal, you have to look beyond that while watching this movie.  It is a work of art.

467190,1,6302451787,"For all bull terrier lovers, the cover of the video draws one to it.  Baxter is a beautiful bull terrier both on the cover and in the film.
As a french movie with subtitles, it is cute seeing the dog speak french and  to ""hear"" his thoughts.
Baxter is a misplaced bully trying  very hard to ""fit it"" with all the families he was shifted to for  one reason or another.  He was never really loved and he was forced to be  left alone for days on end without food or water.
The ending to this  movie was horrific with Baxter being beaten to death by a fascist boy and a  subtitle that reads "" I guess I should have obeyed"".
As an  officer of the Blue Ridge Bull Terrier Club - a nonprofit, tax exempt  organization whose charter is the rescue and placement of abused bull  terriers - this movie is offensive and should be removed from shelves!",949881600,,839,4.213836477987422
467271,3,6302451787,"Many things about this film's [packaging] are misleading... Obviously, , the dog you see in the photo of the cover is an American Pit Bull Terrier -- or, possibly, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier -- looking appropriately vicious. Well, the dog in the film is a Bull Terrier, which is a slightly smaller but no less muscular breed; also a popular fighting dog at one time. Secondly, this is more of a dark comedy or an artful, succinct, and wry drama. The film is narrated as if we are hearing the sophisticated, calculating thoughts of a canine absolutely desperate for a fulfilling role to play in the lives of humans. Although there is death in the picture, no scene depicts any sort of brutal dog attack -- as Baxter is as clever as any human, and stronger, and is looking for peaceable fulfilment, not disdain and violence. This is not a horror film -- it's not even a thriller, really. Baxter is , quite frankly, the most interesting character in the film, but fair warning- the ending is both anti climatic and un realistic. With more thought put into the script, this would have been a better film.",1402531200,,1102,4.598984771573604
467272,1,6302451787,This movie (Baxter) did not live up to the hype other reviewers had created for it. As a horror fan I was disappointed tremendously and would not recommend this movie to anyone.,1399075200,,177,4.5625
467273,4,6302451787,"It was very interesting to note the expressions on the dog's face as he experienced one life transition after another.  Naturally, he became mean, and it was interesting how he used his power of thought to achieve results",1376438400,,221,4.815789473684211

467275,5,6302451787,"If you see the cover you might ""Baxter"" is just a French version of ""Cujo."" In reality it's more like a dog version of ""Taxi Driver."" It's smart, subtle, and scary. It's a far more cerebral film than what you might expect. A sociopathic dog narrates his life and plots acts of violence to express himself and get what he wants. This isn't ""Lady and the Tramp,"" Toto. The film is full of great brooding atmosphere and tension, but is this film's ability to capture the utmost in chilling moments without the use of gore or cheap surprises. ""Baxter"" is a genuinely disturbing masterpiece that not only will spook you as you watch it, but it will leave you with much to think about regarding its implications. Bravo.",1308096000,3,713,4.578125
467276,5,6302451787,I first saw this movie when I was nine and I laughed so hard that I never forgot it. If you don't like subtitles get over it and make a point of seeing this flick. Baxter kicks Old Yeller and Benjii's butt.,1299888000,,206,3.9285714285714284
467277,4,6302451787,"What caught my attention was the pit bull on the cover. When I read that the movie was about a bull terrier I was rather miffed because I love pit bulls and think that whoever designed this cover used their bad reputation to try to market this movie (oddly enough even though a pit bull's on the cover, a bull terrior is on the spine [or whatever it's called]). That bias aside ... I'm pretty sure that Baxter isn't sociopathic ... it's my understanding that sociopaths don't catagorize their thoughts as ""unnatural"" (a word Baxter uses multiple times when relaying his violent or unhappy thoughts). I picked up the movie thinking I'd be in for a unique take on animal horror (think ""Man's Best Friend"" minus all of the animal experimentation and add a big splash of realism) - the picture on the back of Baxter watching the baby crawl towards the water was chilling and I was looking forward to seeing a movie about a trully evil dog. What I got instead was more social commentary than anything - whether that was the film maker's intent or not.

That disappointment aside, I really enjoyed this film (with the exception of the graphic scenes where Baxter is being abused by that Hilter-in-training creep). I found myself sympathising with him almost right from the beginning and rooting for him to find someone who would make him happy and give him the life he deserved. A lot of the other reviewers already summed up the movie and brought up some spoilers so I won't rehash it all. Suffice to say that even though this movie was pretty misrepresented, it was thought provoking. I'm very glad I decided to buy it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone - even if they didn't like foreign films.",1270598400,5,1707,4.615131578947368
467278,3,6302451787,"I have to say as a dog lover and animal rights activist that a few scenes seemed way to real for the late 80s and if the abuse if the bull terrier and the black dog (and a few others)were really real, then I am ashamed to give any stars and take them back, but I am giving the makers of it the benefit of the doubt.  That being said, it was like a trainwreck for me.  I can't stop thinking about this movie.  I knew I wasn't going to like it the minute I started watching and I was deeply disturbed, but I couldn't turn away.  I started out hating Baxter in the beginning, but there was always a part that felt a little bad for him because of the narration that tried to show the dog's thinking versus our own.  By the end of the movie, I felt that the boy and other characters were so evil that it made this murdering but loyal dog seem innocent.  Throughout the movie all Baxter is trying to be is to be loved, whether killing the baby, or the old lady to get there.  I actually found myself wanting Baxter to have a good owner which I though he would have in the kid before he lost his mind.  All Baxter wanted was approval from his owner as well as challenge.  Finally he got those from the boy and grew a conscience that's why he disobeyed and didn't do kill the boy's friend.  But his conscience and loyalty did him in in the end.  One thing I disagree about with the end is that I do believe the kid does get in trouble because you better believe the other kid that he tried to get Baxter to attack ratted him out.  Another option is that the kid tries to kill his parents (like they set up in the end) so that he can be with the lady that Baxter loved across the street from the old lady (which turns out to be the irony= he really si just like Baxter in that way= wanted to be loved).",1211846400,2,1793,4.00561797752809
467279,1,6302451787,"I struggled with whether I could in good conscience recommend this film for any reason.  The film is indeed very original and has good acting and production values.  But the dog who is the central character is more a metaphor for the depraved depths of the human psyche; certainly the traits attributed to it have nothing to do with dogs and everything to do with human sociopathic behavior and mental illness.  And yet viewers will have great difficulty not empathizing with it as a dog.  WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD: I had a knot in my stomach from the first seconds of the film through the violent and disturbing denouement in which the boy abuses and kills the dog, yet kept watching in the absurd hope that somehow the filmmaker would find a way to redeem the story.  The ending was very unsatisfactory: the boy lies about the incident and goes back to his suburban existence.  Not only is this just too depraved for my tastes, but it makes no sense in terms of the boy's persona, which is totally obsessed with Hitler's final days and suicide.",1206662400,5,1045,4.591397849462366
467330,5,6302451787,"Really funny, and passionate movie, the new cover is terrible, but the movie is the same gold.

This is NOT a horror movie, its a really funny and interesting look into the mind of a dog.",1191974400,,187,4.194444444444445
467331,4,6302451787,"...because after viewing this film you may find yourself thinking,""What in the hell is going on in my dog's head?"". Is your dog really as sweet as you think? He/she sure has a lot of time to think doing all that lying around. People snap all the time and we somehow always find it shocking. Dogs are much more closely connected to that wild genetic material that is telling them to stalk, hunt, kill. I originally saw this movie about 15 years ago and it has stuck with me. A stunning study in existentialism.",1187568000,2,509,4.425531914893617
467332,4,6302451787,"The advertising for this DVD release of Baxter is misleading.  Originally billed as a dark comedy, the Region 1 package describes Baxter as a ""thoroughbred killing machine,"" and features the tagline ""He'll love you to death.""  Baxter's body count is amazingly low for a ""horror"" movie; I think he successfully bumps off one person.  This is not a horror movie.  Baxter is a sociopathic bull terrier, but the motivation for his violent acts are jealousy and discontent, not blood lust.  The film is a darker example of the dark comedy genre, but it is still comedy.  The sociopathic canine narrator is absurd, not frightening.

I ran across this film in a high school French class and enjoyed its existential dog.  It's not for everyone - there is violence, sex, and scenes of possible animal cruelty - but it is a unique and worthwhile 83 minutes.  The DVD picture quality is decent (though nothing special) and in widescreen format.  Sound is fine and the subtitles (at least the English ones) seems to follow the French reasonably well.

Recommended.

EDIT: Originally described Baxter as a pit bull; he is a bull terrier.",1185148800,6,1124,4.8578947368421055
467333,4,6302451787,"This movie is not for the faint of heart or for those easily upset.  It's an imaginative and well-made movie, full of uncomfortable pathos.  Baxter is an intelligent and sensitive bull terrier who longs to find the right master.  His narration is brilliant in dark, slightly sultry French--the man's voice is perfect.  It's a very human depiction.  For example, Baxter eroticizes the young woman who is his owner for a short time, then kills out of his jealousy for her affection.  I found myself moved and disturbed by his desires, and also enthralled with the brutality.  It's a mean little movie and with violence against children and animals (I don't believe that much of it is shown--but it's still upsetting), as well as Nazi references that may out-and-out offend people.  As a litmus test, if you saw the film Parents (a great, but dark psychological thriller and comedy) or Curdled, then I think you might appreciate Baxter.  If you're wondering where the comedy in the film is, then I would have to say it's in the deadpan narration juxtaposed with the scenes.  It's not ha-ha comedy, but chilling and ultra dark.

Some of the reviewers were upset by the brutality or the depiction of the dog as evil, and my take was different.  I didn't think of Baxter as evil, so much as passionate and misled by his desire to serve the right master (some good commentary on Nazi Germany).  Overall, I don't think the director's intent was to glorify the violence or meanness, but to make us think of the ways in which we inadvertently create monsters and to make those monsters, be it a lonely and cruel boy or a dog with human desires, sympathetic.  I feel terrible for anyone who accidentally rented this as a family movie.  This is an artsy film geared at adults who aren't put off by pervosity, think Gods and Monsters or Apt Pupil. A tough movie, but thought provoking.",1122336000,11,1872,4.681957186544342
467334,1,6302451787,"Others have pretty well summed up the story, I just wanted to add that this movie is the typical sadist, subjectivist, anti-life on earth, bed-wetter's ""life is bad"" movie, where they take the most funny and cheerful dog breed and personify him as a little monster; damned from the start. No I don't own a Bull Terrier. I should be so lucky some day. As one reviewer already stated... by the end of the movie the dog winces and such. (...)

467335,5,6302451787,"Baxter goes thru three masters.
The first, an elderly lady who didn't like him or understand him.
The second was the ""paradise"" he would view from the old ladies window, the loving young couple across the street. This blissful match was shortlived by the arrival of THE BABY.
Finally he goes to a boy who he feels total camaraderie with. This is a boy, who writes the word ""Pain"" in his journal and then smashes his palm down on a thumbtack...
Baxter is in heaven with his new master that he thinks is similar to him...until  the boy orders him to do something that goes against his grain (did the boy think he was an animal?) and finally disobeys, which was his salvation and his ruin.
Among the many haunting scenes in this movie, is the one scene where the boy is looking out of the same window that Baxter used to look out onto the young couples ""paradise"", longing to belong to them.
It's sort of circular like The Tenant.
I understand how some people would dislike this movie,but I feel it has redeeming qualities. It didn't spoon feed me pat smug answers.",1057968000,13,1062,4.474226804123711

When i described the second to last scene as cold blooded i meant it as a compliment. I felt i was pretty clear about this given everything else i said about this movie but evidently i wasn't clear enough. Cold blooded is absolutely a compliment. I would have made a similar declaration about James Brown, The Rolling Stones or Alfred Hitchcock at the height of their respective skills.

There are some things that are a little disturbing if taken out of context (especially if you are an overly fretful parent). I strongly disagree with the reviewer who alludes to there being ""two of the most cold blooded scenes"" he/she's ever seen. Give me a break, just look at what is and has been coming out of hollywood, nothing but sex and violence (no sex in Baxter by the way).
