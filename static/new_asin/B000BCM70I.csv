8085144,4,B000BCM70I,"I bought Vol. 1 of the Golden Collection, and it was missing some of my favorites. So I took a chance on this, and was pleasantly surprised. Regardless of another review here, the title list on the copy I received was absolutely correct.  Source prints are not terrible, with minimal washing out of color. It's an odd collection, but you get the Gremlin and the fabulous wallpaper Chuck Jones backgrounds on ""Wakiki Wabbit"".
Go for it!",1402704000,,435,4.723684210526316
8085145,1,B000BCM70I,"Buyer beware! The episode listing is very wrong; it lists titles that aren't there & doesn't list some titles that are there. With the exception of Bugs Bunny, it's a weak collection of animation. I only paid a dollar, though, so I got what I deserved.",1195516800,2,252,4.5
8085146,5,B000BCM70I,"4 Bugs Bunny and a ""Censored 11"" cartoon highlight this collection that for the most part is very well restored, with overall excellent definition, and only one with major color deterioration. 9 of the 10 episodes are Schlesinger Studios productions, and feature the voices of Mel Blanc as Bugs, Arthur Q. Bryan as Elmer Fudd, and the music of Carl Stalling. Track # 6, ""An Elephant Never Forgets,"" is from the Fleischer Studios. Total running time is 65 minutes.

Episode list:

1: ""Falling Hare,"" 1943, directed by Robert Clampett, animated by Rod Scribner. As Bugs reads ""Victory Through Hare Power,"" a Gremlin, a tiny but mighty master saboteur of military aircraft, sneaks up on him, and they both take a Hare-Raising flight. 5*

2: ""Bugs Bunny Bond Rally"" AKA ""Any Bonds Today?,"" 1942, directed by Robert Clampett, animated by Virgil Ross and Bob McKimson. This is an oddball patriotic piece with Bugs singing Irving Berlin's ""Any Bonds Today?"" and then a chorus singing the National Anthem. Includes Bugs doing an Al Jolson imitation that is sometimes considered racist and edited. 4*

3: ""The Wabbit Who Came to Supper,"" 1942, directed by Isadore ""Friz"" Freleng, animated by Richard Bickenbach. Uncle Louie has willed Elmer Fudd (looking very rotund in this episode) 3 million $, but there is a catch! Elmer must be kind to animals, especially rabbits. Bugs makes the most of this stipulation, and we see a rare glimpse of the Wonderful Wabbit in drag. 5*

4: ""Wackiki Wabbit,"" 1943, directed by Chuck Jones, animated by Ken Harris. Lots of great hula dancing and song (""Trade Winds"" by Friend/Tobias) in this episode. Bugs evades being dinner for 2 castaways. Tedd Pierce, one of the writers of the episode, is caricatured as one of the castaways. Color tends towards earth tones. 5*

5: ""Foney Fables"" (""Funny Fables"" on DVD box is incorrect), 1942, directed by Isadore ""Friz"" Freleng, animated by Richard Bickenbach.  A twisted look at fairy tales, with ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" as a central piece. Stories include ""Cinderella,"" a huge ""Tom Thumb"" who owes his size to Vitamin B-1, and ""Old Mother Hubbard."" This episode was originally released in b&w, and has been well colorized. 4*

6: ""An Elephant Never Forgets,"" 1934, directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Seymour Kneitel and Richard Crandall, music by Sammy Timberg and Jack Scholl. The animals go to school, and are taught by Teacher Duck, in this adorable ""Musical Revue"" episode. Color is a little deteriorated, but considering its age looks good. So cute it's almost 5*

7: ""Confusions of a Nutzi Spy,"" 1943, directed by Norman McCabe, animated by Izzy Ellis. Bloodhound Eggbert helps Porky Pig track down the ""Missing Lynx,"" a spy who is a master of disguises. This episode has substantial color deterioration, and is in sepia tones. 4*

8: ""Hollywood Steps Out,"" 1941, directed by Fred ""Tex"" Avery, animated by Ben Shenkman. Celebrities are seen doing the conga at Ciro's, in this cleverly drawn episode. The stars with the ""biggest parts"" include Jimmy Stewart, Greta Garbo as a cigarette girl with huge feet, Bing Crosby, and Clark Gable. 5*

9: ""Jungle Jitters,"" 1938, directed by Isadore ""Friz"" Freleng, animated by Phil Monroe. This episode is one of the ""Censored 11"" cartoons United Artists banned as being too racist in 1968. One can understand why, but it is nevertheless a fantastic piece of imaginative animation, and should be appreciated for its artistic skill. The Gadget Salesman tries to sell his wares in the jungle, is about to be cooked by cannibals, when the Queen falls in love with him. She envisions him as Clark Gable and Robert Taylor, and the salesman has to decide what is worse, to be cooked or married. 5*

10: ""Gold Rush Daze,"" 1939, directed by Ben Hardaway and Cal Dolton, animated by Gil Turner. The City Slicker goes West to dig for gold, and gets the scoop from the Old Prospector. 4*",1138752000,17,3895,4.90273556231003
