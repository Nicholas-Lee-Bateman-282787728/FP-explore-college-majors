Oh well - off to find a rip of the original ending few episodes.",1525996800,,334,4.234375

Despite these trials, their bond remains strong. Thye may be able to overcome any challenge together, but what will happen when her life span comes to an end?

This is a great anime. It is very similar to Steel Angel Kurumi. It also has a bit of a Love Hina, and Girls Bravo mood about it. I personally like it better than Kurumi, and Love Hina. The animation is pretty good, there are lots of great characters. The voice acting, and soundtrack are also very decent. My favorite part about this show is the many different genres it spans. There is action, comedy, drama, and romance. This show has a very sweet love story going on, but there is also a lot of nudity and pervy stuff thrown in there. This show has everything. I can't believe that I just found out about it by accident. It's over 10 years old. I'm very glad I discovered Maharomatic. I think any mature anime fan can find something to love here.",1353196800,,1440,4.373134328358209
7986175,4,B00008OTTD,"Up to now and even into the beginning of this disk, Mahoromatic has been a laugh-out-loud comedy with fleeting moments of drama and action.  Now, at this point the story takes on a very dark side of Mahoro's life.  Continuing the introspective moments, Mahoro decides that she is going to have to battle her old adversary, even at the expense of her own life.  Because of this, she hopes to give Suguru one last dose of happiness before she disappears with very little hope of returning.
The episodes that follow from this decision are some of the most heart-wrenching moments of the series.  Although she still doesn't fear for her own life, Mahoro is no stranger to suffering.  The story is kept a little upbeat with some flashback moments to her training and her time spent with her commanding officers.  But the majority of the episodes remain dark and often quite violent.
The way it all ends up is worthwile for the time being.  The story is kept open with anticipation of a second season, while there is also closure of some sort for the current conflict.
For me, this first season did not dissapoint me beyond the overt nudity.  The comedy, drama, and action was definately enough to compensate for the fanservice pitfalls this series lands in over-and-over again.  Any casual viewer would be satisfied as this being the end of the series and develop an overall conclusion to the story in their mind.  But.... for me, that countdown timer will never go away.",1087776000,,1466,4.713725490196079
7986176,5,B00008OTTD,"...>Mahoromatic is a very depth-fill series that centers around the relationship of Mahoro and Suguru Misato.  Unknown to Suguru, his father served alongside Mahoro as a commander in a secret government organization that has been defending the planet from alien invaders - wacky plot? No, the key to this series is that it is able to take what on the surface may be absurd situations and turn it into strongly heart-felt moments.  Though overall the tone of the series is comedic, there is constant underlying tragedy as slowly each episode counts down to the number of days Mahoro still has remaining.  The show plays out in a rollercoaster ride of stomach-hurting laughs, and throat-lumping misty eyes.  Gainax has achieved an incredible balance between the gut-busting banter of Mahoro and Shikijo-sensei, and the repenting whispers of Mahoro's ""..I don't want to die.""  It is difficult to provide a truthful review without revealing too much information, but suffice it to say that the story's extremely memorable characters will reside with you long after the last episode is done.  My only wish was that Gainax could have chosen a less heart-breaking ending...",1054425600,11,1166,5.142857142857143
