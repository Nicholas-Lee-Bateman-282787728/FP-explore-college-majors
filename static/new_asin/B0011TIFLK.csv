8242212,1,B0011TIFLK,"The product is marketed as either one film or a film with a short. The half hour  ""Money Vampire & Weed"" appears in front of the much longer (1 hour or so) ""Crimson."" The first short is about 3 girls who get jacked by a fourth girl who subsequently dies leaving them with a bag of money wanted by a vampire. It includes a dumb blond. The second feature is about there ""Chi Eta Pi""  sorority nurses out for a good time who meet Sammi (Stuart Brazell) and have vampire issues. Film includes a semi-dumb blond.

Not much to see here. Film didn't hold my interest. Worth a hacker punch even with beautiful young ladies on the screen all the time.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Not even a pillow fight.",1495756800,,701,4.287878787878788
8242213,1,B0011TIFLK,"This was a terrible vampire film. Two girls are out in a field at night talking about someone undead they've killed and they're attacked by a vampire woman in retribution for what they've done. One of the two runs off but the other is kicked and scratched, and becomes a vampire!!!

They then go off after the other woman who hides out in a femal sorority house, which just happens to be no where near a university, nor does it have a phone - none have mobiles, so when they're attacked by the vampire one woman leans out the window calling to a neighbour ""Call the police, we're being attacked by vampires!""

One woman gets bitten on the arm, she breaks free, holding a pointed stick, and saying she'll kill the vampire if she tries that again!

Totally woeful. This is one that could have at least had a titalating factor - but none of the chicks gets down below underwear or a towel.",1216771200,3,886,4.390243902439025
