8699691,5,B00SXBQHNC,"A very detailed, entertaining and highly informational series on lifehacks for almost every facet of life. From the mundane day to day to the ""out-there"" survival situations. Extremely well presented, definitely worth watching and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Brian Brushwood or who is interested in being prepared for the worst case scenarios or someone who simply likes to learn!",1502841600,,400,5.075757575757576

8699695,5,B00SXBQHNC,"Solid show with lots of information about a lot of real world issues. People who don't know about the ""hacks"" shown are going to become victims of the substantial criminal element in our country. Some hacks are basic common sense or street smarts but others are clever things that most people don't think about in day-to-day activities. The episode about the ""Halo"" effect is a real eye opener. The identity theft episode is very informative and entertaining. The quasi-survival hacks are interesting but they don't address some real world survival preparedness hacks, rather they deal with being caught by surprise. I buy and watch next DVD if and when it becomes available. This is a handy DVD to have and pass around to family and friends for their edification.",1429401600,,764,4.930232558139535
