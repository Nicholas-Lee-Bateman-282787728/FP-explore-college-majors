8064171,5,B0009OC3NY,"I acquired this film as part of the Ealing Studies Comedy Collection, 5 classic British comedies from early postwar England, all of which were delightful but this one stands out.

It's the story of the captain of an ancient ""puffer,"" a steam-driven coastal freighter that was phased out as diesel-powered ships took over, and his adventures delivering a consignment of cargo from an American shipper (Paul Douglas) through the Scottish canals and lakes.

Be prepared for one hilarious thing after another and one of the funniest situation comedy films I've ever seen.  It's in very good black and white; the acting is superb along with the filming, the casting and the sets.  A wonderful adventure.",1345161600,3,698,5.043478260869565
8064172,4,B0009OC3NY,"Suffice it to say, it's a gem. Reminds me, in spirit, of another movie, ""I Know Where I'm Going,"" similar in that it also involves a fish-out-of-water traveling to far off locales and meeting richly engrossing characters of the Scottish seacoast. Although, in The Maggie, one could say the main character isn't of flesh and blood but rather riveted steel and coal.

The stage is set from the start when the boat enters Glasgow and the two harbor masters make a rather disparaging remark about both vessel and crew. From that moment on the Maggie is on a journey to save herself from the scrap yard. Fortunately for the tired old gal, she has a dedicated, tenacious captain and a crew who love her and will do anything to save her.

There are some ethical issues regarding the captain's methods of obtaining the cargo that will ultimately pay the Maggie's trip up the ways to repair her thinning plates and tired old two-cylinder steam engine. But who in their right frame of mind would fault a desperate man for keeping his mouth shut and choosing not to sink his only chance of survival and salvation?

On the other hand, Captain MacTaggart must be more than just mum in order to save his boat. He must be wily as a fox. And wily he is as the story unfolds, taking us from Scottish port to Scottish port, through the Western isles and Hebrides, through the canals, onto the flats, hitherto and yonder; MacTaggart and the crew of the Maggie doing their best to outsmart and outrun the man who hired them, just so they can get the job done and get their three hundred pounds.

As I mentioned earlier, the Clyde Puffers attained mythical status thanks to the serialized musings of author Neil Munroe. I have Munroe's book as well and started reading it a few days ago. Although there is no reference in the movie to Munroe's fictional captain (Para Handy) or his boat the Vital Spark, this film does them both justice. In many ways it's much better than the BBC TV adaptations, which were, as I'm told by a very reliable source, full of lager and whiskey mayhem.

The Maggie: Four and a half out of five stars.

8064173,4,B0009OC3NY,"One of the lesser known films to come out of Ealing Studios The Maggie has yet the unmistakable stamp of humour that we associate with such classics as Whisky Galore, The Titfield Thunderbolt, The Ladykillers and Passport to Pimlico.  The Maggie is sympathetically directed by Alexander Mackendrick, beautifully photographed in stunning black and white on location on Scotland's west coast by Gordon Dines and has an absolutely perfect music score by John Addison.  It tells the story of the barely seaworthy, ancient River Clyde ""Puffer"" called, The Maggie.  The skipper, a wily old rogue by the name of Mactaggart is delightfully portrayed by Alex Mackenzie.  Short of a cargo, skipper and crew manage to ""acquire"" somewhat less than honestly, the contract to convey plumbing and bathroom fittings to a remote Scottish Island on behalf of rich American businessman, Calvin B Marshall, who  plans to set up home there with his wife.  Somehow, by nuances in the script there is the implication that maybe Mrs Marshall isn't too keen on the idea - possibly the marriage is a little rocky.  Marshall, played to perfection by the ever dependable actor, Paul Douglas, of course soon discovers, through the inefficiency of Pusey his assistant, that he has been hoodwinked.  Nevertheless, believing as he does that all problems can be solved if you throw enough money at them, he sets off in pursuit of The Maggie in order to sort things out.  Shrewd businessman he certainly is but he reckons without the skipper and crew of The Maggie, who totally run rings around him at every opportunity.  His patience is tried to the limit and he becomes so frustrated that he finally threatens Mactaggart with stopping payment of the deposit cheque already given to the skipper by Pusey.  Through all Marshall's raging the crew remain totally good humoured, while Mactaggart says that Mr Marshall would never do that.  When Marshall demands why not, Mactaggart replies calmly and simply, ""because you're an honourable man, Mr Marshall"", which is more than can be said of Mactaggart!.  Of course that is exactly what Marshall is, an honest man who has somewhat lost his way in his pursuit of wealth, and whilst on this strange odyssey through the Western Isles, Marshall slowly begins to realise this fact.  During one of the many delays on the journey, and much to his continued anger and frustration, a number of locals are taken aboard The Maggie, by Mactaggart, and ferried to a nearby out island to attend the 100th birthday party of one of Mactaggart`s cousins.  Despite Marshall's anger the skipper invites him to come and join the party as well.  Somewhat reluctantly he does so and much to his surprise and pleasure, he is warmly welcomed and very soon is joining in the dancing and enjoying himself.  He is charmed when a beautiful young local girl invites him to dance, and is flattered when she confides in him her wish to marry - not the young man her family want her to marry because he has prospects, but the man who will probably never be rich and ""own his own boat"" but whom she truly loves. Their talk together and the simple genuine open hearted generosity of the local people, who do not have much in the way of material wealth yet seem so able to enjoy life to the full, seems to be the catalyst and Marshall's re-discovery of his true self at last begins to take shape.  A host of well known stalwart British actors are featured in almost every scene, Moultrie Kelsall, Geoffrey Keen, Jameson Clark, Andrew Keir, Dorothy Allison and Hubert Gregg as the poor benighted Pusey.  Not forgetting of course, Dougie ""the Wee Boy"" played so naturally by Tommy Kearins. Perhaps not the best to come out of Ealing Studios it nevertheless deserves recognition, if only for the excellent portrayal of all the characters and the way in which they blend so well together.  The comedy may tend too much to the whimsical for some but the eternal ethical questions of integrity, truthfulness, loyalty and self respect are all nonetheless addressed.",1181001600,8,4036,4.855685131195335
