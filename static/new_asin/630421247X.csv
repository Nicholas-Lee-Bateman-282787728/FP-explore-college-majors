The price for the VHS, it's too much for something alredy obsolete, please release it on DVD.....!!!!!",1181260800,,244,4.444444444444445

7864786,4,630421247X,"I saw this movie a few times back when WE was still Romance Classics.  What a fun movie! It's not particularly mind-blowing or fabulous, but if you are looking for a random and different romance, this is the movie for you.  Joseph Fiennes, not much more to say there.",1049846400,3,267,4.428571428571429
