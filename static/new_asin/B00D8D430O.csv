8590549,5,B00D8D430O,"It's a Region 3 DVD from Thailand, but it's the only DVD I could locate with the original Japanese dialog as an option. It plays great in my Sony region-free DVD player and it's a pro-quality DVD, so I have no complaints whatsoever. Actually not a bad movie given the library of Godzilla movies as context. If you can find this, buy it. Japanese language versions of Japanese movies are always better than the horrible dubbed versions.",1393632000,,435,4.662337662337662
