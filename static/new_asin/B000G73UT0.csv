8129190,4,B000G73UT0,"I was a little leery of this series because of the cover and just the fact that it was only 13 episodes. Most series that have that short amount don't uusally have good content. I've got to hand it to Genoen, which I've should've known based on Samurai Champloo and R.O.D. It has great storyline and a lot of good action, though I wish there had been longer action scenes.

A couple things I'm disappointed with is the characters and their voice-overs. The unrefined seem to be in for comic relief, but it's very poor. Shiro's sexually comments and Kionosuke do it for me. I'd also would've liked to see a little more talk from Jubei's counterpart, Jubei II. Plus, the acting is a little too rehearsed. It doesn't seem very relaxed, but overall, I loved the show.",1228608000,,763,4.528985507246377
8129191,5,B000G73UT0,"I saw some of the epsiodes at a local libary and liked it, so if want to buy it and you on a buget try the Anime Legends verison or buy as an import.",1168992000,,149,3.411764705882353
