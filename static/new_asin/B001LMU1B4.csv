3688109,5,B001LMU1B4,"During the 1950's, my father was a fashion designer who spent months in Japan every year.  During that time he came back home and told me he had been profoundly moved by a film he viewed in Japan - a Kurosawa masterpiece entitled ""Ikiru.""  Perhaps a year or two later I had the chance to see the movie - and yes, I too, was deeply, even spiritually changed by the film.  Many others, perhaps thousands, have encountered this effect.

The film opens in Tokyo with Mr. Watanabe, perhaps in his early 60's, as a low level office clerk stamping papers for his superiors - actions without meaning.  When he starts feeling gastric pain, he visits a doctor and learns, to his horror, that he has only a few months to live and has contracted a painful stomach cancer.  Like some who learn they have contracted AIDS or another terminal illnesses, he is forced to review what he has accomplished in his life. In this soul searching,  he comes to the conclusion his life has meant little to others.

Scared, he goes into the Tokyo night district and is attracted to a young woman - a person of youth - as if contact with her would change his fortune. But on reflection, he realizes that he must search elsewhere, within himself, for the solution to what matters in his life.  Shortly thereafter, he is confronted with a standard document at work, an application for approval to build a playground for young children in the inner city.

In the past, Watanabe would have routinely stamped the project ""denied"" or taken no responsibility at all...but this time, looking at his life, he decides differently.  Of course, Mr. Watanabe, by himself, has no power to approve the project, so he makes it his life's work - for the months that he has left - to see that the children's playground gets approved and is actually built.  It is through these efforts that Watanabe's life takes a turn to radiance.

One could argue that the film does not have the technical photographic perfection of, let's say, Director Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"" or ""Throne of Blood.""  Nevertheless in a quiet and profound way, the film is actually more powerful, more moving, more life-affirming.  There are several moments in the film that deeply touch the viewers...one in which Mr Watanabe sings to himself a melancholy folk ballad that the young should enjoy life for ""life is short.""  The second is a moment when he observes a gorgeous sunset and realizes that he has not taken the time in his life to contemplate, or to meditate, on the beauty of that experience.

Indeed, I consider the movie one of the 25 best black and white films ever made.  Kurasawa's ""Ikiru"" is therefore not about dying but about life, about living, about the choices we make in obtaining life.

What does the film mean to me, today? In those situations where I  falter and need ""inner strength,"" I remember the film to find that secret energy to remain true to my integrity and life spirit.",1234828800,23,2934,4.64922480620155
3688110,2,B001LMU1B4,"Ikiru (To Live) (1952) looked very promising, and I am a great fan of Kurosawa and Takashi Shimura. However, within the first six minutes, it was obvious there was a problem with the subtitling. There were no English Subtitles. Most of the dialog went without any sound whatsoever either, and those Japanese subtitles that did appear were often truncated - the sentence would break in the middle. Plus, I can't read Japanese.

This may have been a Kurosawa crew problem, as the lower part of the picture seemed slightly out of alignment, and may have cut off the subtitles, and showed only the top line when there was more than one line of dialog.

Unfortunately, I could not figure out any way to re-align the picture, so it may have been a DVD problem. Very disappointing, as I had looked forward to watching this movie.

Nothing made any sense, and it was just too difficult to try to figure out what was happening. But, eventually, through lip reading and obvious hints, I did. So English Subtitles were not really necessary if you've studied Kurosawa and Japanese film. In all, Ikiru (To Live) is just a silent Kurosawa film.

So, basically what I got out of Ikiru (To Live) is to be happy with yourself, don't smoke, and to be very courteous to dirty, scheming, corrupt politicians.",1383004800,2,1288,4.685840707964601

3688115,5,B001LMU1B4,"As we grow older, we become far more insightful and introspective.  We question the life we've lived and seek to define our purpose.  The two best days in our lives are the day we are born and the day we discover why we were born.  This movie hits directly upon this topic, but in a different way than I was expecting.  Not only must the protagonist determine his purpose, but he does so working within the worst bureaucracy ever created.... the Government.  The movie does an exceptional job of pointing out the challenges we face as we begin nearing the end of our journey, as well as pointing out the problems associated with a government run society.

This is NOT a dark movie.  It is not light and airy, either.  To get the most out of this movie, I suggest you read the Death of Ivan Ilyich by Tolstoy.  By the title and the author, it may sound like 14 tons of bituminous coal heavy, but it really isn't.  It's a very short story, quick to read, but very poignant.  Regarding the movie, yes, there are sub-titles and yes, the movie is in black and white, but what the movie conveys is well worth the time and effort to watch it and read the sub-titles as you go.  Plus, if it were filmed in color it would lose a great deal of its effect.",1349740800,,1245,4.273504273504273
3688116,5,B001LMU1B4,"This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. While it is certainly not my favorite film by Akira Kurosawa, I think it is his best. It's beautifully photographed, well paced, and has one of the most compelling main characters in cinema. I'd say that Kenji Watanabe is like the Japanese George Bailey... but with terminal stomach cancer. I'm not going to explain more about this film, because it's really one of those few great movies that need to be *experienced*, not explained.",1333065600,,486,4.7976190476190474

3688118,5,B001LMU1B4,"The Film: This was my first ""non-samurai"" Kurosawa film I bought and found it more powerful and moving than all of his samurai films. Kurosawa draws you in and comfortably holds your attention throughout. And even though I knew the full plot of the film, in the end, I was moved and touched more so than any other film I have seen in a very long time. Every shot is a masterpiece and all of the actors preform at a level you do not see often. If you love his samurai films, take the next step and try this one!
The DVD: This was my first ""Essential Art House"" DVD. It is just the film with no special features. The transfer, both in picture and sound, is not on the level as my ""Criterion"" DVD's, but was acceptable for the price.",1269734400,5,730,4.184397163120567
3688119,5,B001LMU1B4,"Thanks to Criterion for making this masterpiece available. Kurosawa's retelling of Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich is beautiful on every level. No other filmmaker has or had the talent to frame every shot perfectly, while keeping his subject matter deeply human. Kurosawa knew humanity, its quirks, weaknesses, regrets, follies, and most importantly, the heights to which it can soar. Ikiru tells the story of a many who does what proves to be nearly impossible in the lives of most. Upon learning he is to die of stomach cancer, he changes his life. He learns to Live. But as with any tale of enlightenment, of those who gain an inner clarity about themselves, and who live their lives guided by that clarity, in truth and goodness, the majority do not understand. Boris Mouravieff call it the Law of Exception. Like drops jumping from the stream, only a few on the surface ever leave the inexorable pull of dictates of culture. The ones that remain cannot fathom those who have become free. And so, as Kanji Watanabe becomes free, as he Lives and as his work produces fruit born of his Being, those who follow are unable to overcome the resistance of inertia and entropy. A deeply saddening, but equally uplifting film. Highly recommended.",1266105600,10,1244,4.845070422535211

8318787,4,B001LMU1B4,"Akira Kurosawa's IKIRU (""TO LIVE""; 1952) is not designed for people's entertainment and viewing pleasure. Rather--like the biblical Parable of the Good Samaritan, and like Herman Melville's novelette BARTLEBY THE SCRIVENER and Leo Tolstoy's short novel THE DEATH OF IVAN ILYCH--this film is intended to wake people up and urge them to reconsider their life goals--and, in most cases, to alter their goals for the better.

The PRIMARY strategy in Kurosawa's film, as in Melville's and Tolstoy's fictions, is to show us an ordinary man suddenly encountering a disturbing NEW experience that forces him to reassess what ""meaning"" his life ""ought"" to have. In IKIRU the protagonist, Kanji Watanabe (played by Takashi Shimura), is a city government's department supervisor--a man who has been coasting along for almost 30 years, complaisantly self-centered, shuffling papers, often passing the buck, and never taking any initiative. And then, abruptly, like Tolstoy's Ivan Ilych, he learns that he has a fatal cancer and only has a short time to live.

Fortunately for Mr. Watanabe, after a short period of pleasure seeking, he is given some excellent advice by a perceptive young woman--and with new determination he decides to do something in his remaining time to benefit people in his community.

And then, a few months later, he dies.

The SECONDARY strategy of Kurosawa's film is to show us a huge array of city officials and their subordinates who knew and/or worked with Mr. Watanabe. These people, at a tribute dinner, argue about every facet of Watanabe's efforts to benefit others during his final months: Did Watanabe know or not know that he was dying? Did Watanabe really accomplish anything, or were some other people, especially the mayor, the real benefactors? Etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. ... for nearly FIFTY-FIVE MINUTES.

After dozens of people have voiced their views, a consensus is finally reached ... and many of them assert that THEY, like Mr. Watanabe, will from now on do their best to help the public by cutting red tape and pushing worthy projects through to completion.

And then, in a very brief scene we are shown they have either forgotten the lesson they learned from Mr. Watanabe's life ... or they are too cowardly to act on that lesson and just cave in to peer pressure ... and continue, ineffectively, exactly as they'd been before. This scene, with its pathetic negative examples of failure to learn and failure to change, is VERY effective as Kurosawa's final strategy to urge us to remember the lesson and to act on it in our own lives.

In my judgment, this film offers us a very worthy life lesson and shows us many poignant, vivid, relevant scenes, including many scenes of ineffective, wasteful and wasted lives (especially within government agencies).

I felt, however, that the ""debate"" about Mr. Watanabe's life and death in the second section of the film was excessively long and often took us off the main track of the film; that lengthy part of the film could easily have been improved by cutting it by at least 15 or 20 minutes.

Weighing this film's strengths against this weakness, I would give IKIRU a solid ""B"" grade.",1425340800,,3165,4.956603773584906
8318788,5,B001LMU1B4,"This film is artistically stunning, in its power. It is thought-provoking and possibly life-changing. Please watch it when you can.",1403308800,,131,5.6
8318789,5,B001LMU1B4,"This is a movie about a man, Kanji Watanabe, who has wasted his life but finds purpose and meaning when faced with certain death (rather reminds me of ""Samurai Rebellion"" in that sense).  It is the story of a Tokyo bureaucrat who has become a robot who simply does his job but is not living life in any real sense of the word.  When he finds out he is dying of cancer, he realizes how he has wasted his life and finally discovers what is important.  In doing this, he becomes ""alive"" for the first time in 20 years (again reminiscent of Samurai Rebellion).  The story is derived from the Leo Tolstoy Novella ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"" but the incomparable Akira Kurosawa once again shows his own genius in the spin he puts on it.  Without question this is one of Kurosawa's best.

The second half of the movie is particularly good.  His family, friends and co-workers sit at his funeral swapping stories about him in an attempt to figure out what his motives were.  It becomes obvious what a strong influence this man has become over the people he has come in contact with.  The outcome is that we find that in facing his death he has become a really likable and decent human being.

An excellent movie that is more of a work of art.  Definitely one of the best movies I have seen.  Highly recommended.",1389657600,3,1302,4.401673640167364
