8270389,5,B0018ONO4G,"I purchased this DVD more than 2 years ago and forgot to post a review.  First of all, I adored hearing the artists who were recording at the time I was saved.  The most stunning and wonderful event in my life, my salvation experience.  Thank you Jesus.  Needless to say, I enjoyed this DVD very much.  I'd never known Janny Grein previously and I just fell in love with her performance and love for the Lord.  Now, I just find out that she passed away in August 2011.  Sure wish there was much more of her CD's etc to enjoy and worship to now that she's gone.  Bless you Janny!",1319155200,6,578,4.1909090909090905
8270390,5,B0018ONO4G,"The Beginnings Concert took me back to the early days of ccm.  Most of these tunes sound just like I remembered them.  ""Little Country Church"" still rocks.  There are a lot of goose bump moments.  Reba Rambo McGuire brings down the house with ""Oohs and ""Aahs.""  Enjoyed this very much--it brought back great memories.",1212796800,6,317,4.796296296296297
