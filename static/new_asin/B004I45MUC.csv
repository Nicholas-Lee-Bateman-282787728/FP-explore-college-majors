""Behind The Burly Q""
Directed by Leslie Zemeckis
---------------------------------------
This bare-bones documentary (no pun intended) looks back at the golden years of American burlesque theater, a low-rent, erotically charged offshoot of the world of vaudeville, where comedians and musical acts shared the stage with young girls who did striptease acts and pushed the envelope of social propriety.  Director Leslie Zemeckis (wife of mega-producer Robert Zemeckis) conducted several years of first-person interviews with a number of veteran performers, including many of the most famous striptease artists, along with club owners and other performers, telling their own stories about the glories and the misery of their profession.  They are pretty frank about the downsides -- alcoholism and drug use, grubby venues, sexual harassment, legal hassles -- but most also look back fondly at the camaraderie and air of genial competitiveness, and at the excitement of being in show biz and finding a way out of the economic hard times of their Great Depression backgrounds.  There are also connections to the wider world of famous entertainers: Alan Alda recalls being on tour with his father, actor Robert Alda, who worked as an emcee in the burlesque circuit, and at the decency and kindness of the performers he met as a child; others recall the days when Abbott & Costello warmed up the crowds with their comedy act. It's not a rosy-eyed, nostalgic look back, but even in their seventies and eighties, the interviewees have such large, generous personalities that it's hard not to be drawn in and charmed by their stories.

The heyday of burlesque was in the early 20th Century -- by the 1950s and '60s it had become a socially and economically marginal artform, under pressure by law enforcement on one side and a booming porn market on the other. A handful of performers made the jump into the celebrity culture of the postwar era, and even these women only got so far in the Hollywood and Broadway scenes.  But when it was in full swing, burlesque was a popular artform, frequented by a wide swath of the public, ranging from drunks and roughnecks to families with children who came to the sometimes-cleaner matinee shows.  Zemeckis has done a great service capturing the stories of these aging performers and preserving our memory of what was a very significant though largely forgotten part of American popular culture.  (Many of the interviewees passed away before the film was finished; Ms. Zemeckis got there just in time.)  I would have liked additional information about the project itself -- why Ms. Zemeckis took it on, how she tracked down all these old-timers -- but the film does a good job of speaking for itself. (On a tangential note: it would be interesting to see a similar film made about 19th Century minstrel shows, which is another big slice of American entertainment history which due to its racist content has been labelled as socially inappropriate and thrown into the trash bin, despite its enormous influence on vaudeville, blues, jazz and other American art forms... )  Anyway, if you have an interest in either American pop culture or in changing attitudes to sexuality and eroticism, this is certainly a film worth checking out.

4383908,5,B004I45MUC,"Behind the Burly Q (First Run Features) is quite simply the best and most complete history of America's lost art form. Burlesque, as wonderfully explained here, was not just a matter of T&A, but of glamour, comics, style, wit, a soupcon of raunch and heavy dose of showmanship. Live entertainment in general is eroding away, but the first modern victim, Burlesque, was lost about 50 years ago . . . lost to porn and expenses and lack of youngsters wanting to learn the art. Leslie Zemeckis should be given praise, awards and recognition for this incredible piece history preserved at the last possible moment, while a few or the artistes are, or at the time of the filming were, still with us. More than that, Zemeckis should be given more and more assignments, for as this documentary proves she is nothing short of brilliant.
  Zemeckis, wife of producer/director/writer Robert Zemeckis, replaces anything that could be called judgmental with love. As she interviews these ladies, shows lengthy clips from their past and explains in a seemingly relaxed, but actually a strict and inclusive narrative, each element of life connected with this art form, this world of glamour and glitz comes back with a rosy hue. Yet Zemeckis never turns from the darker side of this life: exploitation, drug addiction, the mob, alcoholism and suicide. When one of the ladies is asked if she'd do it again or if she'd change anything as she looked back on what must be three quarters of a century, she explains with a gargantuan smile that she'd do it again . . . and not change a thing. That's love, commitment to art, and certainly a life well spent.
  Alan Alda, whose dad Robert spent the early part of his career in Burlesque before conquering Hollywood and Broadway (notably with playing Nathan Detroit in the original Guys and Dolls), acts as a sort of chorus, speaking of the life of performers and remembering being mothered by the ladies of the chorus.
  But the draw for this documentary are the ladies themselves---strippers with golden, and perhaps slightly tarnished, memories of past triumphs and defeats, memories of the glamour and the pain, the glory that was burlesque. Ann Corio, Tempest Storm, Gypsy Rose Lee, Lili St Cyr, Sally Rand, Margie Hart . . . all the wonderful performers are here, in clips and contemporary interviews. Behind the Burly Q is a slice of Americana in a near-forgotten memory of show business as it once was.
  And never will be again.",1301443200,26,2464,4.822274881516588

4383915,4,B004I45MUC,"Directed by Leslie Zemeckis and released in 2010, BEHIND THE BURLY Q is lightweight but thoroughly entertaining ninety-eight minute documentary on the golden age of American Burlesque, a type of variety program that mixed low-brow comics, acrobats, singers, lavish production numbers, and--most notoriously and most famously--strippers. But a burlesque stripper was not the sort of stripper we might encounter today.

It's true that most golden age strippers took it all off--but laws varied from state to state and city to city, so complete nudity was not always an option. But unlike most modern strippers, who simply disrobe to music, golden age strippers used a lot of tease, and they usually had an act. White Blaze twirled flaming tassels. Kitty West emerged from an oyster shell and Lilli St. Cyr lounged in a bubble bath. Blaze Star notoriously reclined on a chez which then appeared to burst into flame. Sure, there were men wearing raincoats in the front rows, but there was a lot more to a classic strip-tease than simply throwing your clothes on the floor.

BEHIND THE BURLY Q features interviews with numerous ladies of burlesque. Most have retired and drifted into an unexpectedly grandmotherly aura; a few, like Tempest Storm, were still performing at the time the film was made. A few comics, acrobats, and most surprisingly Alan Alda (who spent his childhood being luged through the burlesque theatres where his father worked) round out the commentary. Their stories are fasinating, always interesting, frequently funny, and on occasion touching. A good many of the women came from impoverished and abusive backgrounds; more than a few struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction.

But what really makes BEHIND THE BURLY Q is the use of old photographs, advertisements, and film clips in conjunction with the commentary. We don't merely hear those who knew her speak of Rose La Rose, we get to see her in action as they do. The counterpoints acheived are often impressive, with perhaps those relating to the celebrated Lili St. Cyr and her sad decline most touching. The DVD has a number of outtakes and bonus tidbits, all of them entertaining, and all of it just enough to make me wish Zemeckis had done at least thirty minutes more. Recommended.

4383916,4,B004I45MUC,"""Behind the Burly Q"" is a comprehensive, well-researched film about the origins and heyday of American burlesque. I saw this documentary on premium cable (it would probably need a little editing for basic cable, and definitely for regular TV), so I can't speak about the bonus features on the DVD.  But the movie itself is quite worthwhile for those interested in the artform and its colorful history.  If anything, there was almost too much information-- stories and anecdotes fly by, making it easy to miss nuances and facts.  But I guess that's what repeat viewings are for-- that, and to get further peeks at the terrific vintage performance footage.

It was fascinating to learn that many famous television and film performers (mostly men, alas) got their start as MC's and comedians on the burlesque circuit, as traditional acts were routinely trotted out between burlesque numbers to lengthen the show and to keep things from getting too racy.  But the women performers who never moved beyond burlesque at least made a lot of money doing it (usually, anyway) and, looking back, maintained a lot of affection for their years on the job.

Playfully naughty without crossing over into pornography, with acts that emphasize skill as well as the performers' physical beauty, traditional American burlesque is now making a comeback around the country, and is routinely scheduled in respectable performance venues.  Fun and informative on its own, ""Behind the Burly Q"" would also be a great companion piece to a live burlesque show-- it might be cool to watch it shortly before or shortly after taking in a live performance, to enhance the overall burlesque experience.",1394064000,,1669,5.069343065693431
