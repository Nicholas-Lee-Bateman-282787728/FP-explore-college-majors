8428807,5,B004GJ6UAA,This is actually a great mix of solo and Quo stuff. Personally I think his solo stuff is great and love the way he incorporates a handful of Quo songs into the show. Great sound and exellent atmosphere and definitley worth buying if you like his solo stuff and Quo!,1381363200,,265,4.32

That said, when taking Status Quo out of the equation his material works much better for me. Actually, I must say I love this whole set of old Quo classics (Caroline, Claudie, Can't Give You More), some of the new Quo stuff (Tongue Tied, one of my favorites on this DVD, or Electric Arena and Blessed are the Meek) and of course the highlights from his solo work (but no songs from King Of The Doghouse ?).
His band is excellent and the addition of the female background singers definitely adds to the live sound.
The sound quality of this DVD is great and the editing is very well done.
A very entertaining Live Performance !
And best of all, with all the pop songs out of the way, Quo released a brilliant rock album with 'Quid Pro Quo'",1308787200,,923,4.372093023255814
