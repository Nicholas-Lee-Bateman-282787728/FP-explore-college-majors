7621795,5,B01B67YA10,"I've always loved Perry Mason, even before I knew he was GAY!!!!! (Raymond Burr, not Perry Mason).",1471824000,,98,4.823529411764706
7621796,5,B01B67YA10,This was the first time I had seen the two-hour Perry Mason's available all in one package.  The price was much cheaper than expected so I snapped it right up.  The dvd's are top quality & the package is what you would expect from a set costing twice the price.  I highly recommend to anyone who is a Perry Mason fan because you will be spending your money on a product that will not disappoint.,1471478400,38,395,4.24
7621797,5,B01B67YA10,I love perry mason and these movies are awesome...I watched all the movies and had no problems with the disks..very pleased with this set..,1471478400,9,139,4.833333333333333
7621798,4,B01B67YA10,"Item arrived a day early which was nice. Like others have commented, Disk #4 has a cloud in the inner part of the dvd and when I played it, the picture was slightly fuzzier. Disks #7 & 8 also has clouds on the dvds and they, too, had some fuzzy elements to the picture. What does that mean? when Perry Mason moves his head, it looks like there's extra peach fuzz outlining his face, and the intro to the movie felt grainier. I haven't watched all 30 yet, but so far from what I've seen, the quality is good for not being re-mastered. The disks are packaged back-to-back and the packaging doesn't feel bulky. No extras or behind the scenes included, just the movies. I also noticed couple of my disks had a blotchy appearance towards the outer circle but I don't see any difference when it plays. I only tested the disks I found with some problems so haven't watched in its entirety. It's going to take a while before I watch all 30 so I didn't want to delay in sharing my experience thus far.  Since some of us are finding similar problems, must be manufacturing related. Would I still recommend? yes, absolutely. Enjoy and happy watching!",1471392000,12,1139,4.44976076555024
7621799,5,B01B67YA10,"28 mm case with 15 holders bound together with no spine I like that the holders fit firmly so it's not like where a spindle has broken and dvds rattling around I have type of case on a few UK releases and it works very well for over ten dvds where a spindle type case wouldn't be any good
As fo the films exact as the earlier releases Evrn if you've got them I still advise to buy complete to save packaging I mean I know have saved space of 13 14mm cases and at a good price Evrn for me in UK total cost 42 that included vat customs charge shipping and my banks sterling exchange fee
Well worth it

Agree with previous reviews about the laser side of 4 and 10 no playing issues and have in past had such discs and none gave failed so far
Disc 9 plays fine on my Samsung player but that player works on all discs from other films and TV series that freeze the Samsung never let's me down
Will try on other region one when I get time to see what happens",1470960000,10,952,3.9583333333333335
7621800,1,B01B67YA10,"Great movies but very poorly manufactured.
1st set.  Disc 9 was badly scratched and didn't play and disc 4 and 10 showed signs of media separation (cloudiness on the laser side).  This is important because even though it plays now, it will become unplayable as the deterioration gets worse.

2nd replacement set.  Disc 9 scratched in exactly the same place but is playable and disc 10 has medial separation.
I was hoping to at least be able to combine the two sets to make 1 good set.  Identical defects on two sets shown a manufacturing problem.",1470873600,43,546,4.645833333333333

7621802,3,B01B67YA10,"Be warned the DVDs seem to be same as previous releases.
The early episodes such as series 1 aren't very good WRT video quality and sound
 However, the pricing is reasonable.
It's a shame episodes weren't filmed in movie aspect ratio-16.9. Too bad there weren't any bonuses.",1470355200,7,274,4.829787234042553
7621803,5,B01B67YA10,"Having seen all 30 of the movies when they aired on the Hallmark Channel's Mystery Sunday back in 2006-2008 or so, it is great to finally be able to have all of the movies, even the last 4 or 5 that were filmed while Raymond Burr was struggling with the cancer that would eventually end his life. I will gleefully pre-order these movies as they have been released in part in many different formats, mainly three box sets containing 9 of the movies each. Back in 2007 Hallmark aired Mystery Sunday with shows like Jane Doe, Mystery Woman, Columbo, Diagnosis Murder, Matlock, Murder 101, McBride (my favorite) and a few other shows I forget and I loved it. I would spend from 11 AM to about 9 PM watching and Perry Mason had the 7-9 PM slot and re-runs at late night and I taped all of them and watched them repeatedly. It will be great to see all 30 movies again with a host of guest stars and superb plots and twists which will make it all worth while. My suggestion is for ALL Perry Mason fans to pre-order this treasure while the price is $35, That is about $1.10 per movie and since it is an official release, the quality has to be superb and much better than the numerous bootleg copies floating around. I will be ordering mine and looking forward to watching each and every one after I get off work in the evenings and on weekend. I cannot recommend this set highly enough. McMillan and Wife and Barnaby Jones and The Jeffersons, along with the Mod Squad and The Equalizer have all been released in their entirety and this is a long overdue and welcome release for sure. I would love for shows like Jane Doe, Mystery Woman, McBride, Murder 101 and Petrocelli to be released in their entirety, I would buy them all, good classic TV shows that never get old and sure beat the mess on TV these days. Get this Mason set the day it is released, don't say I did not warn you when it sells out.",1468972800,124,1892,4.317415730337078

7621807,5,B01B67YA10,Wow! Excellent copies of these made for TV movies. I hated it when we finished seeing the last movie. These certainly enriched our evenings as we watched them in lieu of the violent or foul language options so prevalent today. We will no doubt watch them again at some future date.,1529798400,,281,4.529411764705882

7621839,4,B01B67YA10,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom because she's a huge Perry Mason fan...she still watches reruns from the original series almost every day. I figured she'd dig this since it contains all 30 Perry Mason made for TV films from the mid 80's through Raymond Burr's death in the mid 90's. There are 15 discs with 2 movies on each one. I believe Burr is in 26 of 30 films...Paul Sorvino and Hal Holbrook took lead roles in the final 4 films (Sorvino one and Holbrook three) on account of Burr being ill from cancer. Anyway, mom said she's watched about ten of the movies so far and absolutely loves them. The package arrived fast and in great condition. The only reason I took a star off is on account of the case the discs are in. It is difficult to get the discs out (especially for an older woman) so I went ahead and put them in a small zippered CD case to make it easier on my mom's hands. Regardless, it's a great product for the price that arrived with no complaints. I'm sure that this is a must for any Perry Mason fan's collection.",1516147200,3,1047,4.213930348258707

7621847,5,B01B67YA10,"Perry Mason: The Complete Movie Collection

I had no problem with the DVDs and the quality was about what I expected. If you're a videophile and demand 1080p or even very-sharp 720p for your crazy large TV, you may be disappointed.  Those of us who remember 640x480 broadcast TV and fiddling with rabbit ear antenna will likely be very satisfied with this set.  That's likely true, though as noted in other reviews, the production company could have done a better job in moving the original film videos to digital format.

I played a couple of the movies from my DVD player and was pleasantly surprised with the images on my 42 inch LCD TV.  I subsequently ripped the remainder of the movies to my Plex server, where I'm working my way through the set, and what a treat.  If you liked Raymond Burr and Perry Mason on Prime Time TV, you will enjoy this set with no commercials.  And really, who doesn't like Perry Mason?",1512345600,4,919,4.533333333333333

7621850,5,B01B67YA10,"A nice collection for those of us who were Perry Mason fans starting in the mid-50s. These are Burr's last portrayals of the role and he hasn't lost his touch. One word of advice for Blu-ray addicts: the picture quality is from original videotapes that have slightly deteriorated over time (the originals were filmed, hence a better picture) so it's not unlike watching a VHS copy and isn't the fault of CBS. I doubt there's anything that they can do to improve picture or sound (not stereo) but they are quite watchable and enjoyable.",1508630400,6,535,4.702127659574468

I could go on about each episode some are better than others but they are all great Perry Mason shows. These were made when quality meant something. Now every show has to have some form of sex or violence to be acceptable. I also don't believe these are bootleg copies.

I have enjoyed watching them but I haven't finished them yet. Tonight I played # 7, The Case of the Poisoned Pen, and when it got almost to the end, in the final courtroom scene, the picture began breaking up, stopping, skipping, and the sound was in and out. I finally took it out of the machine and noticed a place on the back that was defective. It was not a smudge or a scratch. It looked as if there was nothing recorded in that space, but there had to have been something, or I wouldn't have been able to see what little was there. I know it's past the time of being replaced, but is there some way I can get another copy of that DVD? It was frustrating not to be able to see how it ended! I hope whoever reads this can help.

7621943,5,B01B67YA10,"I hesitated getting this movie set.  I'd seen perhaps 2 or 3 of them when they first aired years ago, but apparently wasn't all that impressed with what I saw at the time.  After getting and viewing most of the original Perry Mason series, I decided to get the movies---and I was pleasantly surprised and pleased that I did.

The very first thing that struck me was the impressive sound quality of the theme--stereo and full orchestra--a little thing, but set the tone for the movies and performances to follow.  From that point I was hooked on the movies and especially the acting of Raymond Burr.  Although he did a superb job in the early TV series, his performances in these later movies were even more impressive.  I had to keep reminding myself that he was really not a lawyer, but merely a quite heavy actor interpreting a movie role.  Burr's expressions, reactions, demeanor throughout create the strong feeling he is not really acting.

And, then there's his relationship to Della Street, which in the early TV series was close and often personal.  However, in these movies, that relationship comes across as bordering on the affectionate, even romantic.  It is obvious that Burr and Hale must have had a genuine, real affection for each other---notwithstanding Burr's known homosexual relationship.

I enjoy these movies greatly and can recommend them without reservation.",1482796800,5,1382,4.965217391304348
7621944,4,B01B67YA10,"good quality.  surprising to find out the set includes perry mason movies that did not star Raymond burr, but rather had substitutes fill in for him because he was away on business or other reasons.  not the same as perry mason.  there is only one perry mason.  I wish there was more description of each movie on the box.",1482796800,3,321,4.389830508474576
7621945,5,B01B67YA10,"When it was announced back in 1985 that Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale would be reprising their roles as Perry Mason and Della Street in a new series of ""Perry Mason"" TV movies I was ecstatic.  Even though I was a bit too young to have enjoyed the original series during its prime time run from 1957 to 1966 I had become a huge fan when the series moved into syndication in the late 1960's and 1970's.  I simply could not get enough of this compelling, well-written series.  Beginning with Perry Mason Returns in the autumn of 1985 these classy two hour films became must see TV for me.  I saw each and every one of them.

About three years ago, I decided to purchase the entire Perry Mason TV series on DVD.  It was a rather expensive proposition at the time as Perry Mason:  The Complete Series had not yet been released.  But over the course of about a year I purchased the entire set of 18 covering all 9 seasons.  Still, this was money very well spent.  Then in 2013 Paramount finally saw fit to release the first 6 of these fabulous TV movies as Perry Mason Movie Collection:  Volume 1.  The only problem was that at $58.99 the price was just outrageous.  I balked and balked but during a moment of weakness I gave in and purchased the set.  Although the movies were every bit as good as I remembered there was absolutely nothing special about the package and there were no special features.  I vowed not to purchase any more of these sets at that price and stuck to my guns as subsequent volumes were released.  My patience and good judgement has finally paid off.

Much to my amazement in August 2016 Paramount released all 30 of these movies on 15 DVDs at a price just about anyone can afford.  Admittedly, Perry Mason:  The Complete Movie Collection is definitely a no frills proposition but I am thrilled to have been able to add them to my collection.  I have viewed around half of the movies to this point and have absolutely no issues with the quality of the video.  Perhaps I am just not that fussy but at just a bit more than $1.00 per movie what do you expect?  Raymond Burr appears in 26 of the shows and after he passed away in 1993 Paul Sorvino and Hal Holbrook did a superb job pinch-hitting for their old friend.  As always Barbara Hale does a workmanlike job as Perrys able associate Della Street.  I also enjoyed the work of William Katt as Paul Drake Jr. and have always wondered why he was replaced so early in the series.

If you are a fan of the Perry Mason TV show or enjoy court room dramas then you are sure to appreciate Perry Mason:  The Complete Movie Collection..  The writing is always top notch and the acting superb.  And now the price is right to boot.  Very highly recommended.",1482451200,40,2716,4.365269461077844

7621950,3,B01B67YA10,"I love Perry Mason and was thrilled to purchase this movie collection. The movies are great and well worth the money, but the packaging stinks! The outer plastic casing is fairly sturdy and will protect the contents under normal conditions, but inside 4 DVDs are clipped to a thin plastic arm that holds 2 DVDs on each side. (There are 15 discs total). Each DVD is held by 2 tiny clips. I honestly feel as though I am going to break the dvds in half when I try to remove them. After I have viewed the DVDs, several of them will not fasten back into place, so they are left to just shake and scrape around in the outer case after it is closed. I have not viewed many of the movies, but would I buy the collection again? Yes, unless something better became available. It is just nice to know exactly what one is getting before being disappointed after the purchase.

7621990,3,B01B67YA10,"To be clear, I give Perry Mason, all Perry Mason, five stars. This is about the set, not the content.

What you need to know here is as follows:

First, the thirty films appear here, unedited, just as you remember, or, if you are like me and still have a VCR and old tapes, as you are used to seeing.

Second, the quality is on par with bootleg DVDs recorded off of premium cable mystery networks, not that anyone would ever buy such a thing but we all have friends who magically possess such things. To clarify, the picture is, essentially, a clean, largely unblemished picture, that is by no definition clear and bears striking resemblance to a VHS tape being upscaled by an HD television set or a digital streaming copy of a film you know to have only ever been released in 4:3 on VHS. The picture is marred in identical ways to VHS recordings that have been transferred to digital format for Amazon Video viewing, right down to the slight fading line that can be seen on several films over on the right side of the 4:3 picture.

Third, while these were filmed to be 4:3, with intent, as they were telefilms, they were filmed. The fact that the source material was not resurrected for transfer is horrifying but that source material was, for the record, not resurrected. These are actually, though they look like upscaled 280 VHS images, from the 480 resolution television masters. That having been said, the original film could have been transferred in high definition, had they wanted to bother with it.

Fourth, for anyone who doesn't know, these are the same discs that appeared in the volume sets and have no special features or differences in picture or audio quality.

I evaluated two sets, as one had damaged discs, and can say that the picture is consistent across most of the films as the original source elements were clearly degrading. The last few films have significantly better picture as they were, simply, not as old. The lines down the right side of some films appeared identical on both sets and were consistent as to when and where they appeared. There were no significant sound distortions or problems but the sound is fainter than you will be used to if you are used to higher quality DVDs and lower quality Blu-Rays. If you are used to high quality Blu-Rays (me), you will be annoyed that they didn't try harder with these releases.

Raymond Burr deserves better and, while he will be remembered and loved for all that he did regardless of the quality here, they really didn't give him his due in preparing these. To put it simply, the quality of these discs is on par with early-to-mid Mill Creek multi-packs. (Even Mill Creek's recent multi-packs look better than this, sometimes by quite a bit.) Basically, you can see the love that did not go into preparing this set and that it was, essentially, a last ditch effort to make money off of the insanely overpriced volume sets that Paramount had previously released.

That having been said, this is a reasonably priced set at, on average, around thirty dollars for thirty films. The films are all as enjoyable as you remember them having been and they have held up well, even after so many years and even when you factor in the silly mistakes our beloved detective/sidekicks often made in their bloodhound efforts. Seeing Burr's performance as an older, wiser Perry Mason is a joy even on such a low quality, low resolution, low sound, disaster of a release. But don't pay more than thirty for this and get it for less if you can. A Mill Creek in 2006 quality release deserves a Mill Creek in any year price.",1474070400,180,3585,4.616954474097331

Took my time watching this collection over several weeks and now that I completed the collection, I feel like I've lost a good friend.  Funny how watching a large collection of TV/movies with a specific actor can cause one to feel like they know that person.  If you are a Perry Mason/Raymond Burr fan, you'll enjoy this collection.  Of course, the last four movies were produced after Mr. Burr's death in 1993 but the ones with Hal Holbrook I believe Raymond Burr would be pleased with.  As for the packaging of the DVDs, I don't really care for the double decking used, but if you're extra careful, no damage should be done.

8749352,4,B01B67YA10,"We like all the Raymond Burr Perry Masons.  Sadly, they didn't start making these movies until after some of the original cast had died.  Raymond Burr died in 1993, before they finished all of these movies.  They apparently has problems assembling a steady replacement cast of characters.  William Hopper, who played Paul Drake in the origial series had died in 1970, so they brought in William Katt to play Paul Drake Jr. for about 6 of the movies.  His character just wasn't nearly as good as the ""father"" Drake was.  They also tried using a young new lawyer as a sidekick for Perry Mason.  William R. Moses did a good job portraying attorney Ken Malansky, but an attorney acting like a detective for a sidekick, just doesn't work as well.  Though not in all of the movies, James McEachin, as Lt. Broc was the best replacement for Ray Collins' Lt. Tragg character or Richard Andersons' Lt. Drumm characters.  As for the D.A.'s that went up against Perry Mason, they never seemed to find a steady one to replace William Talmans' Hamilton Burger character.  I think of the long list of attempts, David Ogden Stiers' character D.A. Michael Reston was probably the best, and I think he hung in there the longest.  The last few movies, they pretended that Perry Mason was out of town and someone else was standing in for him.  Of the stand-in lawyers for Perry Mason, Hal Holbrooks' portrayal as attorney Wild Bill McKenzie was great.  Barbara Hale as Della Street is the only person who managed to hang in there from the beginning of the TV series to the end of the movies.  All in all we really enjoyed the entire movie collection.  I would definitely recommend it.",1533254400,,1664,4.6506849315068495
