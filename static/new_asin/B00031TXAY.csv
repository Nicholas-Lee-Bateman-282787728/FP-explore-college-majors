2155714,5,B00031TXAY,"I first saw this movie in a drivein movie theater in Pasadena,

Texas. It was part of a twin bill witl ""I Eat Your Skin"".I first

thought the mpvie was going to be a vampire movie. Was I ever wrong. I turned out to be a movie that I have never forgotten.

  The movie takes place in a small town. A band of Satanist

hippies set up camp in the town. The hippies first rape and beat

a girl. Her grandfather goes for revenge and is beaten and fed

LSD.The grandfather owns a bakery where his grandson works. He

decides to gain revenge. He kills a rabid dog and draws blood from the rabid dog. He injects this blood into the meat pies that he then sells to the hippies. Shortly thereafter the hippies

become violent and wild. They start foaming at the mouth and

begin attacking each other and people that live in the town. They

commit murders in many various ways such as decapitations. The

whole thing is very gruesome. You will never see scenes like these. Order is finally restored. The movie ends with the little boy walking off into the sunset. I am glad that this cult classic is now available on DVD.I never thought thatI would be able to watch this movie again. Be sure to watch this movie. You

will never forget it.",1135641600,7,1228,4.3056768558951966
2155715,5,B00031TXAY,"I Drink Your Blood is one of the best Drive-In /Grindhouse flix of the 70's. Still packs a punch and a few kicks. Twisted,Bloody,and funny. Yes, b-movie funny. Manson-like/Satan/Hippy Cult on L.S.D infected with rabies attacks small town. Yep,could happen.",1113955200,11,256,5.425
2155716,4,B00031TXAY,"i thought this was insane,the pace this film moves at is way faster than some of the other drive in nightmares of the 70s.

you could say this film lives up to its cover art,well maybe not but what film in the 60-70s did.the only reason the art today lives up to the film,is they just take a picture of the crew,amp it up on a computer and another crummy modern day poster yuck!!!!!!!!well the extras where ok the interviews etc.

i liked the trailer, but the trailers for other films was not my thing.the lost scences from the directors cut where stupid.

i like the theatrical cut,forget the directors.",1108252800,5,604,4.472727272727273
2155717,5,B00031TXAY,"Wow, where to start? Well first off I should say that I love the horror/zombie/gore stuff. Although this was totally exploited by Fangoria, this is still not a mainstreem movie, and those seem to be the better ones.

  Anyway, this movie is really spectacular. One of the biggest problems I, and other fans, seem to have is that most horror movies don't keep us interested, until the last fifteen or twenty mins. But this is an exception. Although the whole movie is not one, big climax it still keeps your interest.

  The movie is not as gory as a Lucio Fulci, or H.G. Gordon Lewis film, but it is still has more blood and guts than Friday the 13th or a thriller type of movie.

  So basically a hippie cult stays in this tempoary ghost town, due to the construction of dam, and they end up teasing and terrorizing a small boy and his grandfather. To get revenge on them the kid goes out to the woods and kills a rabid dog. He just happens to work in the only bakery left in town, for the time being, so he infects some meat pies with the rabid blood from the dog. The hippie cult eats them, bcomes infected and basically go insane. Pretty original if you ask me.

  So anyways, this movie is very well directed and pretty decently acted for a low budget. The main leader of the cult, Horris, probably gives the best performance out of all of them.

  The movie has some pretty creepy shots, what with dead bodies, severed heads, blood, and of course the foaming of the mouth. It just has a generally eerie feel to it, as horror movies should. So I can definitly see why Fangoria picked this for a midnight classic. But don't be fooled by their website, you can get this DVD at other stores besides theirs.

  So all in all this movie is terrific for the true horror fan. If you choose to pass on this one, well, your loss my friend.

Thanks for reading.",1106784000,27,1856,4.327536231884058
2155718,4,B00031TXAY,"I saw this movie on a double-bill drive-in with I EAT YOUR SKIN back in 1971 and for many years have sought out it's release. I found it on VHS quite a few years ago but it was a dissapointment not only in quality but in completeness.  Boy, are we lucky.  Thanks to Box Office Spectaculars/Fangora we have gotten a DVD release that is quite the find.  As with DEADLY SPAWN it is loaded with extras and deserves your attention. In the deleted scenes is an alternate ending which I wish they would have included in the original theatrical release and I suggest going to it at the conclusion of viewing the movie for a more complete effect of the attitude intended.

There is also an easter egg in ""bonuses"".  Click on the hatchet and you'll find a quickie that demonstrates the fun they've had in this release.

Also I found that selecting X-RATED THEATRICAL RELEASE or DIRECTOR'S CUT in ""set up/feature options"" makes absolutely no diference in what you will see.  They appear to be the same.

You will find a very weird dance (way too long) by Bhaskar (the cult leader) by going to ""bonuses"" then ""filmographies"" then to Bhaskar and click three times to get to his dance.

Over all this DVD proves again that the big guys out there CAN give us great things if they care but isn't it sad that it only happens generally with these obscure releases. If you appreciate the off-the-wall movies that show off your collection you must add this.",1100736000,10,1437,4.517374517374518
2155719,4,B00031TXAY,"What can be said about ""I Drink Your Blood""? Well, for starters it's one of the most little known and under appreciated exploitation films ever made. It holds the distinction of being one of the first films to ever be given an ""X"" rating for violent content. Though this film is not quite as graphic as some bootleg video dealers would have you believe, it does have a decent amount of gore and disturbing content on hand. Unfortunatly this film suffered the same MPAA and theatre owner censorship/butchery as Wes Craven's ""Last House On The Left"", so the film ended up in about 20 different cuts. Until the release of this dvd the most complete version was a Japanese bootleg that would usually run you about $40, and the picture quality was unbearable. Fans of sick, 70's exploitation will be enthralled by this dvd, but for the squeamish and mainstream fans who cant get past the cheap effects and poor acting, I advise you to stear clear of this dvd. To sum this up: they sure don't make them like this anymore, so take advantage of this dvd while its available, or you'll be kicking yourself when you're missing out.",1097193600,9,1121,4.61
2155726,2,B00031TXAY,Big fan of classic horror movies but this one was pretty plain.

2155752,5,B00031TXAY,"What can you really say about ""I Drink Your Blood""? It's a horror/exploitation film that was WAYYYY ahead of it's time, yet captures a perfect snapshot of Vietnam-era horror.

""I Drink Your Blood"" starts off with a multi-racial, Satanic hippie cult performing a ceremony out in the woods. After brutally attacking a young local girl, the commune finds itself stranded in the very, very, small town. The young girl's brother decides to strike back at the commune and injects their food with the blood of a rabid dog. Soon the crazy commune goes even crazier and begin hacking up each other and infecting anyone else they come into contact with, including a large group of construction workers.

""I Drink Your Blood"" is so over the top you can't help but enjoy the on-screen lunacy. From the bizarre Satanic rituals, to the neon-red bloody special effects, to the crazy, but creepy musical score, ""I Drink Your Blood"" is a wild ride.

I do say that ""I Drink Your Blood"" is ahead of it's time, in that it introduces ""fast zombies"" about 3 decades before ""28 Days Later"". The rabid psychos, don't simply shamble after their prey, they come charging full force, waving deadly machetes and foaming at the mouth to boot.

There are plenty of scenes played out that still have the power to schock viewers, the fate of the pregnant cult member, the use of real animals in several scenes is pretty disturbing, and the bloody special effects still pack a pretty good punch (in this day and age of too much CGI, I love watching the old school F/X).

If you're a fan of classic horror, or love Grindhouse splatter flicks, then ""I Drink Your Blood"" is a must own.",1322697600,,1649,4.652920962199313

2155755,2,B00031TXAY,"I host a movie show in Cleveland and got a request to show this film. I only knew it by reputation, having never seen it at the midnights when it was showing back in the 70's. Having seen it, I really wish I'd seen it back when it was new. I mean, it still would have sucked the high hard one, but it would have done so in its own time period.

This is a ridiculous movie, seeking to exploit the hippie-devil-worshipper-cult paranoia present after the Sharon Tate murders. A group of hippies led by an Indian leader (and by Indian I mean a native of India, not of America) move into an abandoned hotel in an abandoned town. It seems the town is abandoned because a dam is being built nearby and the only people left are 1) The lady who owns the Bakery 2) the Old Veterinarian and 3&4) his grandson and granddaughter. Well, teenage girls being what they are, the granddaughter manages to get herself gang raped by the hippies (I think - they're not real clear on this point) and when Granddad goes to give the hippies a piece of his mind, they punch him in the stomach and dose him with acid before sending him  home again. This gets Junior a might peeved, so he does what any good grandson would do - he contrives to feed the evil hippies meat pies with rabid dog blood injected into them. The hippies (most of them, anyway) chow down on said meat pies and become foamy-mouthed lunatics killing everyone that gets in their way. Apparently, rabid people and dogs can't stand running water (???), so keep that in mind in case you're ever attacked by rabid hippies. Personally, I just thought that the running water was too close to bathing and that's what scared them off. Anyway, half the construction crew from the dam get infected after gang-banging one of the less attractive hippie girls and soon the whole town (or what's left of it, at least) is overrun by either foaming hippies or foaming construction workers.

This is a pretty good DVD - it has some great features, including a commentary by the director and deleted scenes (including the alternate ending), production stills, etc. It's also digitally remastered so you can bathe in all its badly lit, cheaply shot glory. It's actually quite entertaining as long as you're into this kind of movie.

But the acting was very, very good, though this is an aspect of such movies that is usually scorned and mocked and berated.  The biggest flaw was the rabies effect.  Rabid animals foam at the mouth.  They do not ""mayonnaise"" or ""hair conditioner"" at the mouth.  And the incubation period for rabies is weeks, not overnight!  All in all it was entertaining enough.",1264204800,2,512,4.738636363636363

All gorey horror films that are in the vain of dark humour owe much credit to'I Drink Your Blood'.This has to be seen if you are a horror lover that gets off on weird,gross and sick depraved behavior.

All the text from my version and the shown version are the same, and the disc is the same design as well, which leads me to believe that both the Fango and this version are the same.

The DVD itself is great. It comes with two poster replicas (a small foreign release and a large fold-out american poster), a little bit of information on the film, and all the extras you could stand. There's also a few funny easter eggs (including a very special song from the director himself!), all of which you can find here: [...]

2155762,5,B00031TXAY,"I Drink Your Blood is possibly the best movie about rabies-infected satanic hippies on a killing spree ever made, and it is my favorite American grindhouse/horror/drive-in flick......word's cannot do this little gem of an American horror film justice.
The plot is a about a group of satanic hippie's that costantly drop acid and perform satanic ritual's who come to a small town, and piss off the wrong little boy by forcing his grandpa to take acid. The little boy then get's revenge on them by taking blood from a dead dog he found infected with rabies, and secretly putting it in their meat pie breakfast. They all slowly start to go insane, killing each other off, and go on a rabie's infected rampage of murder and rape. If that does not sound like this coolest movie premise ever to you.........then I don't know what does?
I Drink Your Blood play's out like a comedy most of the time (like my review's) with ridiculous subject matter, hilarious performances, over the top gore effect's, and is one of the most entertaining movie's I have ever seen. It is also (supposably) the first movie to get an X rating in America and I can't recommend this movie enough.

I Drink Your Blood contain's all the essential grindhouse/drive-in elements:

- Rat barbecue's
- Gang rape
- Rabie's infested satanic hippies
- A grandfather that has a bad trip
- Abortion
- Over the top gore
- Meat pie's
- More rape
- Self immolation
- Chicken beheading's
- Decapitation
- More gore
- Satanic ritual's

This Grindhouse Releasing release is (like alway's) amazing. They really went the extra mile to make sure this cult-classic got the release it deserve's. Included is a full director's commentary, director's cut of the film, deleted scene's, interview's, trailers, there is even a full length version of I Eat Your Skin as an easter egg! If you go on the special feature's page it even has an axe that when you click on, chop's one of the character's in half!.....Pretty sweet (Just to give you an idea of the extent they put effort into making this a good release). Thank you Grindhouse for releasing an amazing print of an amazing movie.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1195603200,38,2161,4.770053475935829

It came out just after the Manson murders, so all of those nice peace loving hippies have become Satanic, Acid Eating, murder cult hippies.  They even stuff grandpa full of acid.  Acid not being enough of a trip.  The hippie cultist go on a rabies trip after eating some yummy pies with bad dog blood injected inside.  This movie has sights and sounds that will not be easily forgotten, so cook up a nice meatpie and enjoy an experience that may very well turn your stomach.

Some Thoughts About The Movie (NOT a base for my rating):
first of all I DRINK YOUR BLOOD is entertaining. It is strange and (very) funny at the same time. The (goofy) gore segments are not as explicit as you may think. There is more myth to it than hard visual facts on screen. Legend has it and so on. Some shots are well done and support the occasionally frightening atmosphere quite well. From a technical point of view it is a decent made movie. Do not expect I DRINK YOUR BLOOD to be too intense. The filmmakers focused on cheesy effects, illogicality, harum-scarum running around more than they relied on building up tension a cleverly written script could have provided. On the other side this movie is worth seeing it for exactly these reasons. While not expecting too much you can have a good time with I DRINK YOUR BLOOD. I strongly have to exclude the scenes involving real animals. Fortunately such things are not seen any more on film today. Some advice for first-time audience: Expect nothing at all. Forget all the hype and rumors. Free your mind. Sit back comfortably and (try to) enjoy this Shocking Midnite Madness Muppet Freak Show. You will notice it is one of its own kind. I like it for what it is and how it was made, including all the hilarious fatuity in it. I do understand that the number of cult followers all over the world is still growing.

No Grain Baby, No Gain / The Transfer:
The transfer for this BD set is good but not extraordinary. The original camera negative is in superb condition, well washed, cleaned and stabilized. The grain structure was slightly reduced after scanning and I could make light edge enhanced. All at the expense of some texture, grip and fine-details-quality. The flaws of the digital ""restoration""-process fortunately are not too distracting. I still had the feeling this was originally shot on film stock in the year 1970. The result still looks relatively film-like but could be better. Surprisingly both transfers of I EAT YOUR SKIN (1971) and THE BLUE SEXTET (1971) on the bonus BD do look more organic and film-like than the main feature. Why? It is such a complex matter by now. I will not delve into detail here and I skip this sad chapter for now. I DRINK YOUR BLOOD has a nice and rich color palette good contrasts and there is no crush in blacks. I could not spot block noise and other digital atrocities. A more downright true to its roots transfer would be the one I had preferred. For me the transfer looks a bit too clean and shiny but I still can enjoyed it and I am sure most fans out there will simply love it.

I will add detailed updates regarding the transfer quality of I EAT YOUR SKIN and BLUE SEXTETTE after seeing the flicks completely  It will take some time.

Cut and Run (The Choice is Yours):
1) The Unrated Directors Cut:
This is NOT a version int&eacute;grale from one complete source. This version contains seamless inserts (mostly dialogue, but also the nice downbeating alternative ending) from a low quality source. It looks like they used a worn out 35mm copy to recreate the complete DC. The 35mm material shows washed out colors, brightness boost and many dirt particles. It is very low on details either and misses texture. At least it is done from film material and therefore the situation could be worse. For example like the BD sets of NIGHTMARE IN A DAMAGED BRAIN (1981) or DRIVE IN MASSACRE (1976), where the inserts look like heavily digital manipulated SD material taken directly from abysmal mastered DVDs.

2) The Unrated Theatrical Cut:
This is made from the same camera negative and does not contain the above mentioned segments. This is a version int&eacute;grale from one intact source including all the gory segments intact BUT without the downbeating ending which also contains one gory moment.

Both versions have been passed uncut by the BBFC.

Final Thoughts:
Fans, collectors and people with big screens or projectors should spend their money at once although the main feature could look more film-like. It is still good enough to satisfy. Regarding the complete package this GRINDHOUSE RELEASING BD set is truly fantastic. It contains THREE complete movies in good and partial excellent quality! Tons of interesting extras and a very funny Easter egg. For fans and movie buffs there are really no wishes left. Absolutely recommended. This is a definite collector-item and it plays region code FREE!

How I rate / What I rate:
My ratings refer exclusively to technical aspects of BD sets. The more film-like a HD transfer looks and feels via a projection, the more high-class the source is scanned and digitally treated afterwards, the higher my ratings will be. Digital phenomenons like edge enhancement, block noise, digital appealing grain, swarming grain / noise behavoir and DNR filtering will directly result in lower ratings.
I do not rate movies at all. In the introduction part I just offer my opinion, based on taste, preferences and knowledge about film/photography in general. Movies are artificial constructions where many efforts have been taken (including complex postproduction) to accomplish a vision of whatsoever kind. No movie made for cinema ever shot has earned a 1 star rating on AMAZON or a 1 point rating on IMDB. I have studied many publications about making films, their psychological impact, and the subject violence on film. I am a hobby photographer knowing much about frame compositions, color and light effects and different styles. I am also a hobby musician and sound designer for my own private joy. I could rate a movie/ its soundrack, but why should I? Things are what they are and nothing more or less. I like to think beyond mind constructed terms of good and bad. So called ""objectivity"" becomes fast diluted by preferences which results in comments of personal taste. These comments are fine but they go without any base value for creating a rating-scale out of them. Technical aspects are a different kind of matter. DNR, edge enhancement, block noise and such things are obvious even on small screens and maybe we can speak more of objectivity and measurability in this area. I think we should be informed about the quality of a product.

All about Ev(m)e:
I am a collector of films for 27 Years, own about 3.000 films (would be far more, but I often sort out transfers I don't like) and watch them in a home-cinema room via bigscreen projection. I am also a hobby musician and photographer with some experience scanning camera negatives in high definitions. I am fascinated by film (from reels) since I am a kid and spent hours for hours in cinemas and visiting film festivals.",1490918400,3,6798,4.791808873720137
