I am a long time track coach and loved it. Played it. Stopped to rewind and played again. Took notes and was able to implement two of them the next day. I would not only recommend this for beginners looking for a starting point but even a long time gray beard like myself who can pick up a few new tricks. For example he had a drill he called his ""Max Velocity Run"" that I found worth the money of the video in itself!!!",1342569600,,583,4.261261261261262
