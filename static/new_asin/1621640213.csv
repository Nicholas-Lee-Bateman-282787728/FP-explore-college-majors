7800522,5,1621640213,"Visually beautiful, spiritually fulfilling, historically enlightening, this docudrama leaves no stone unturned in bringing to the forefront the sanctity, simplicity and majesty of the life of St. Francis of Assisi. It is based entirely on a biography that was penned down by one of his closest followers upon the order of the then reigning Pope; every aspect, facet and side is explored in a very detailed way, from his early days, conversion, his spirituality etc. Therefore the viewer can be assured that he/she is being given an eyewitness account that is entirely fact based and which is rare given the propensity towards artistic license.

The characters in this vita of the saint is masterfully reenacted by Italian actors in Italian (which gives it an authentic feel; at times the actor playing the part of St. Francis looks directly into the camera making it seem that the Saint is addressing the viewer directly)
Also the historical events are dealt with in a way never comprehended or heard before, of particular note is the meeting of St. Francis and Pope Innocent III.

When purchasing this DVD I assumed that it dealt primarily with the miraculous events in the Saint's life. Though some aspects of the miracles are covered, like the miracle of the swallows and of the fish, and of course the stigmata (the theological aspects of these miracle are superbly explained), the gist of this presentation is really the miracle of the LIFE of St. Francis; a life filled with a true love for Jesus Christ instead of the lukewarmness prevalent in those times, a life of voluntary poverty amidst the corruption of the clergy and nobility, zeal amidst indifference...one can go on and on.

Accompanied by stunning visuals of the basilicas of St. Francis, St. Clare, the Portiuncula and Rivotorto(where the order was first formed), beautiful artwork by Giotto and other famous artists and great interviews by experts on this subject, this DVD presentation is bound to edify and increase devotion to St. Francis.

This documentary is 60 minutes long in English with interviews in Italian subtitled in English. There are no special features on this DVD save for some movie trailers.

For good films on the Seraphic saint. I recommend the following:
