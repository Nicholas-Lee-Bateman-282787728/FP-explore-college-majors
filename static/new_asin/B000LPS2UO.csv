2712240,5,B000LPS2UO,"An old movie, about a guy that is isolated.  Kind of like the boy in the plastic bubble only this guy is obessed with a female rock star.  I enjoyed it and for Tawny Kitaen fans, you'll love this one.",1264809600,3,200,3.975
2712241,2,B000LPS2UO,"I'm a Tawny Kitaen fan but the movie, dancing and mucic is 80ish and not good. The acting is pretty horrible. The plot is alright but the movie tries to be touching and falls a little short because of the acting. If you like Tawny though, she is nice to look at. But that is the all you have from her as well.",1209427200,3,309,3.9206349206349205

8163360,1,B000LPS2UO,"This review only pertains to the quality of the DVD. It is horrible. With no exaggeration, playing my old VHS copy of this movie on my 55 inch screen yields a far better picture than this DVD. I'd suggest either finding a copy of the VHS or waiting until they come out with an upgraded DVD.",1463097600,,290,4.196428571428571

8163364,5,B000LPS2UO,"I have always been a fan of this movie and it's soudntrack. Sure - it's cheezy - but hey, it was the 80's!  The quality of the DVD is pretty good. I'm so used to high-def that it's hard to tell just how clear a DVD is - especially on a 70-90-inch screen. It's much better than my VHS copy of the movie so for that I am happy.",1361491200,4,325,3.710144927536232
