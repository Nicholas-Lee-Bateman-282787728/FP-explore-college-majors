8008577,3,B00019HP9Y,"This is a video transfer to DVD. Picture quality is a little grainy but still good and the sound is ok though a couple of times it gets a little mumbled, but this is due to the fact that it is in a class environment so its not professionally done in some studio. Also the knife defence techniques are out of date, it is not as he currently teaches his knife defence system. In this DVD he uses Karate style blocks and Aikido type techniques, he does not do his shielding, close, takedown and escape system. On the cover he is doing shielding and is dressed in military clothing, this is not the case. It's indoors and with police and military dressed in some camo or tee shirts, track pants etc. Still, some good stuff in there like how to search an offender and knife fighting techniques ( the angles) and drills. For those who would ask as a civilian, ""...when would you search some one?"" maybe in a home invasion if you get the upper hand or someone who is causing trouble or is caught maybe in an act of terrorism and is apprehended by citizens, you may need to check him for any weapons etc. You never know. Also it does not run for 93 minutes only 60.",1461196800,,1157,4.263636363636364
