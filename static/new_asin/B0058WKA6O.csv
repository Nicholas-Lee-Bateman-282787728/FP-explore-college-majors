4601960,4,B0058WKA6O,"This review is for the RvB Season 9 DVD.  And if you are new to the series, you probably don't want to start with this season.

First, I should say that I'm a big fan of Red vs Blue.  The team making these has a history of really great writing which is probably an artifact of the fact that the first seasons were almost entirely ""filmed"" in the game engine and required the writing to carry the story.  By season 9, we are seeing a lot more done outside of the machinima (machinima effectively means using just the game engine versus other animation techniques) and this is both good and bad.

On the good side, the action scenes are a lot of fun.  And in season 9, they do get ridiculous.  And the unrestricted animation environment allows for a lot of great physical humor.

On the down side, there are a few scenes where this actually becomes a detractor, as it feels like the animators were getting so carried away with making the action more and more insane that the story has trouble moving forward, getting stuck in the one event spread across multiple protracted fight scenes.  As a result, we don't get to spend a lot of time with the snarky reds and blues of Blood Gulch and that part of the story felt like it could have gotten a lot more development time.  Especially given how far Church has to develop introspectively to get us from the last scene of Season 8 to his climactic revelation at the end of Season 9.

All of that said, this is another great season in a great series.  What we lose in not seeing a lot of our Blood Gulch... heroes is probably overstating it, participants?... is made up for with a lot of great story-telling about the Freelancer program and some really fun homages to the prior 8 seasons.",1323561600,2,1731,4.391849529780564

- You don't need to treat me like that. I'm not crazy, okay? I'm totally and completely sane. Now if you'll excuse me I need to go blow up this dead body. - Agent Washington",1322352000,2,217,4.190476190476191
4601962,5,B0058WKA6O,burnie burns and the crew have outdone themselves this time the animation in the fight scenes is just mind blowing its better than most scripted fights in movies and the story is as funny as ever.,1321747200,4,196,4.472222222222222
4601963,5,B0058WKA6O,A great continuation of the RVB story.,1452816000,,38,4.571428571428571
4601964,5,B0058WKA6O,"For those who have never seen ""Red vs Blue"", it is best to start watching the series from the beginning and the reason for this is because one, this is the type of series that requires you to do this so you won't be confused, and two because it takes away the impact you would've got if you started from watching the series by starting with season one. I do not intend to spoil much if I do spoil anything. What I will say about season nine is that for those who love sci-fI, action, drama, mystery, and comedy, then you will love ""Red vs Blue"" season nine. This serves as a sequel to where ""Red vs Blue"" left off while it also serves as a prequel. This season will have a focus somewhat on the gang from Bloodgulch, and it will cut back to another time which will provide back stories for Freelancers such as Agent Tex. Freelancers are basically the baddest of the bad here. Freelancers originated from the program known as Project Freelancer which carries out special military operations. As it all plays out, the past and the present eventually tie in together as it all unfolds and progresses. Keep in mind that this is only the first part of the Project Freelancer saga, so it will all continue in season ten. Red vs Blue has put many movies and shows to shame, and this season is one of the prime examples of that. ""Red vs Blue"" is in fact a web series, but watching it feels like that this is a movie, or at least what a movie should be like. This has story, intrigue, suspense, twists, turns, depth, heart, and truth. I highly recommend this, so do yourself a favor and get this once you have the chance to do so. For those who have watched this and or the other ""Red vs Blue"" seasons, remember this, whatever you do, don't say goodbye.",1448236800,,1744,4.320121951219512

This season is so different from the first season. I loved the story of project freelancer, and the greatest VFX I've seen on any animated movie. There's action, violence, a whole different vibe, and still the same classic RVB humor and fun. This is one not to leave out of your collection.

4601980,4,B0058WKA6O,"I like the series but the sub-series sets (6-9, and 10-12) plot lines about Project Freelancer and Dir. Church, and multiple simultaneously time lines with ongoing flash-backs and flash forwards, are very hard to follow, for me. The sets could really benefit from adding a feature to review ""Previously"", or ""Last Season on RvB"", or ""Our story so far...""  Would really help piece the time lines together. For me, it's almost impossible without a player roster, to keep straight which AI personalities have been installed/uninstalled in which soldier characters, etc. Boggles the mind! Some may love that aspect. Almost gives me a headache. I need a teams & players roster to follow along!!!!!",1429228800,,692,5.123893805309734

Season 8 found a great balance; adding interesting action sequences while staying true to form. In Season 9 I found myself doing other things whenever the action sequences started.

Nobody ever watched Red vs Blue for the action. Rooster Teeth should take notice",1407715200,,534,5.746835443037975

4602055,5,B0058WKA6O,"RVB season 9 is the start of a all new story arc called Project Freelancer, which is the back story to All the freelancer characters we've met over the last nine seasons (Tex, Wash, The Meta etc.) and then some more we've only heard about. (Carolina). It by far is one of the best season over all. It is followed by RVB Season 10 currently airing on RoosterTeeth.com.

4602057,3,B0058WKA6O,"I've been a big fan of Red vs. Blue all the way up until now, own the original five seasons as well as their ""remasters"" as well as seasons six through eight and think the entire thing is simply fantastic, through and through.  Season nine is different though and I'm hoping that season ten will back off of this new trend so I can go back to watching an enjoyable show.

There are two distinct plotlines in this season that for the most part are not orthogonal.  If that wasn't enough of an issue they also have a completely different tone (""serious"" with lots of action entirely in CGI, funny with in-game rendering).  Of the two, the in-game humorous plotline is very well worth watching with some bits of plot (about as much as the first seasons had) and plenty of humor with the sprinkled odd bit of action.  This is a glorious return to form and to be well applauded.

The CGI/action plotline is another matter though.  Plenty of characters remove their helmets which I personally find brings it down a notch somehow, the action in no way even vaguely resembles the laws of physics (which once in awhile is okay, but after awhile makes you numb to it, i.e. ""of COURSE they flip a motorcycle 1/8mi. through the air into a chopper and land on a truck when you could've, you know, just had one character hit the other one""), and the tone just comes off as bad, cliche action movie stuff.  None of the characters develop anything even close to approaching a personality, there's little-to-no humor, none of it's at ALL believeable...it's just flat-out boring to watch.

The reason the CGI sequences were appreciated in season eight was because they were used sparingly and when they had a full-blown one it was saved for the climax (even there they still had in-game rendering to ground it).  Now that it's all the time in one of the plotlines it quickly loses its luster and normally forgivable flaws start to wear on you.

I appreciate that they tried to give a deeper story to RvB in seasons six through eight and I thought that generally it was pulled off very well because it integrated nicely with the humor, never losing sight of the fact that this is a comedy first and foremost.  I don't think Rooster Teeth knows what they want to do now and it shows in this season.  For the first time ever I'd say you can skip this season.",1348617600,3,2337,4.49645390070922
4602058,5,B0058WKA6O,Obviously it is hilarious and has great story line. Season 9 is by far the best and most complex. When I watch this I laugh harder while at the same time expecting a shocking explosion at every turn.,1347753600,,199,4.2631578947368425
4602059,5,B0058WKA6O,"I've been a huge fan of RvB, and Roosterteeth, for a very long time. I purchased this dvd quite a while ago just to support the company and am thrilled with it. This dvd comes with so much extra content that isn't on their website or online, with the bonus scenes and commentary, that it is worth every penny for any RvB fan to plop down a few bucks for it.",1345420800,,357,4.042253521126761
4602060,5,B0058WKA6O,"For those who may think this is just a Prequel to the first 8 seasons, THINK AGAIN.  Its a Sequel with Highlander style backstories .  Without giving away too much... you will learn some of the freelancer history, You will find new depths to Church (Epsilon/Alpha) than you may have ever thought possible. Memory is the KEY, but that key can be turned the other way.  There is a Ton of old style humor, Many returning characters, and get your reference book out for the repeating gags...

4602062,5,B0058WKA6O,"I have all 9 Seasons currently available on DVD [writing this June 2012], and I have to say I have thoroughly enjoyed each one. Season 9 was not, by any means, a disappointment. It gives you more information, more character, and continues to play with the ever growing skills with the ""animating"" they do. But it doesn't lose any of the fun. I love how many places Red vs Blue starts to seemingly take you somewhere more serious, but then stumbles you right into the brilliant comedy that made it enticing in the first place.
Marathoning Red vs Blue is a grand experience that I highly recommend to anyone and all.

Oh, and the DVD looks nice, sounds pretty good, and has some nifty features. Get it!",1338854400,,700,4.511811023622047
4602063,5,B0058WKA6O,"It brings back the original crew of misfits arguing in a canyon with a little twist, along with the story of the freelancers that is pretty freaking awesome.

P.S
The guys from Smosh have a small cameo, it's pretty great.",1338508800,,221,4.525
4602064,4,B0058WKA6O,"This season was...interesting.  The action scenes don't bother me even though rvb used to be strictly comedy or drama with little to no action.  I DO agree with some of the reviewers that says the action was a little too long and that it kinda detracted from the story.  I think we still got some good character development from Church this season.  We also get to hear the Alpha's voice real briefly (if u don't know what that is, watch season 6).  I thought the scenes with the Reds were pointless and did nothing to effect the plot in the end, they're just there and acting a bit different much to Church's dissapointment.  As far as humor goes in this season, it was pretty good, but I didn't feel like there were a lot of laugh out loud moments.  Caboose is still as funny as ever though!

One of my characters is Director Church, probably figured that out by the title of my review right?  Am I wrong, or does the director NOT act a lot like the Blue Church despite that the Blue is supposed to be based on him.  I think Burnie Burns does a great job giving each character a different personality and talent (example being that York is an infiltrations specialist but pretty bad at combat), and even the Meta had to be admired somewhat before he turned into a bad guy and all.

Anyway, I still like season 8 better, but this one is probably third on the list (season 1 being second)",1329696000,,1388,4.341085271317829

4602068,5,B0058WKA6O,Season 9 did not disappoint. The cutting humor for which Rooster Teeth and RvB are known for is resident plus a very action packed story and dynamic soundtrack. Good stuff.,1326240000,3,172,4.766666666666667
4602069,3,B0058WKA6O,"RvB Seasons 1-8 had an interesting arc, starting from (what I think) was a drunken experiment to create a hybrid of a video game and MST3K and culminating in some fairly strong storytelling with Season 8. But although there were weak moments (Sister, anyone?), it pretty much always entertained. I have to admit that I watched Season 9 in one sitting and can honestly say I don't remember much of it, which is a bad sign. Even more telling, I remember a few of the mock PSAs/shorts that also came on the DVD, which is like saying I remember seeing a movie trailer but couldn't tell you what the movie was about. For those who've watched Seasons 1-8, getting Season 9 is pretty much a no-brainer. However, it might well be that we won't know if this season was good or bad until we see further developments in (if they happen) Seasons 10 and beyond.
