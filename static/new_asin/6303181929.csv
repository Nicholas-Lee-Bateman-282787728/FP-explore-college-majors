602446,1,6303181929,"This tape is too difficult to keep up with, it has too many dance moves and it is too hard to catch on to. I prefer a step tape, most people especially beginners would have a hard time and would most likely give up trying to use this tape.",976752000,12,239,3.8979591836734695

602598,5,6303181929,"The exercise video PLATINUM SERIES BUNS OF STEEL 2000 is available used for just one cent. Breaking into two parts - one an aerobic routine, the other toning - that's half a penny per great workout. Plus, BUNS OF STEEL 2000 features Tamilee Webb, Donna Richardson and Tracy York - one-third a penny per beautiful exercise instructor.

You can alternate between burning calories with the aerobic BUNS OF STEEL 2000 segment and building muscle with the toning part. Or, if you dare, do both. The toning exercises are tougher than they look.

My only complaint about BUNS OF STEEL 2000 is it's essentially a ""live"" shoot. With three instructors teaching, at times two speak at once, neither understandable. A few sound edits could fix that but the skinflint producers let the mistakes stand. Then there's blown shots. As one instructor explains a new exercise move, the image we see is, for instance, a close-up that does not show everything Tamilee Webb, Donna Richardson or Tracy York says to do. Once again, a couple of edits could present the proper image, but a buck's a buck.

Speaking of showing everything, thank God for the big beautiful bottom of Tamilee Webb and how much of it her sexy thong leotard and flesh-colored stockings reveal in PLATINUM SERIES BUNS OF STEEL 2000. Tamilee gives us plenty of peeks at that perky posterior, especially in the aerobics segment. But(t) as(s) if to save the best for last, towards the end (tee-hee) of the toning segment there's a backward kick exercise; you have to see Tamilee's tush to believe it! With Tamilee Webb's backside, it's all upside!

Tamilee Webb even remarks that her breathtaking behind is ""where all my weight is"" during the BUNS OF STEEL 2000 toning segment. I wish we could see her face as she says it, but it's another instance where the camera is on the wrong subject. As Tamilee makes her candid admission about that rear I revere, the video's showing the other girls.",1210636800,,1938,4.793413173652695
602599,5,6303181929,"If you wanted to see serious results in about a month with only one workout, this could be the one.  The only bad thing I can say about this video is that if you're just starting to work out, you won't be able to finish the whole tape the first time.

Although the step section is only about 20 minutes long, the toning section works big enough muscle groups that you stay aerobic for much longer if you do the whole workout at one time.

Tamilee Webb is joined by Tracy York and Donna Richardson (I love her style!) and after the warm-up with Tamilee, each instructor leads you through a step routine. The routines are challenging, but very do-able. The moves stay fairly basic but higher intensity options are offered.  But my favorite section is the toning because it's about as serious a lower body workout as you'll ever find.  Lots of squats and lunges (which I used to hate until I started seeing the amazing results).

Again, if you're committed to reshaping your body, this workout is a sure-fire way to do it.  But remember, nothing worth having comes easy.",1170374400,,1067,4.526041666666667
602600,5,6303181929,"This tape is really a fun workout. It includes great aerobics and great toning all in one. Leisa,Tracy and Michelle lead a aerobics segment that is fun and pretty easy to follow. I think Leisa`s aerobics sections is the funnest. Then they go on the floor for some toning work. The toning work works the abs as well as the buns. I think it is best for the abs. During tracy`s routine my abs did start feeling someting and they were sore the next day. If people do not like this tape it is because they have to work harder trying to get the steps for the aerobic section. I like Leisa Hart`s platinum series a little better than Tamille Webb`s Buns Of Steel 2000 videos. She is easier to follow and cues better. I kind of get lost Tamilee`s platinum series videos. She is better at step aerobics. This tape is really Fun and it is effective.",1164153600,,839,4.3164556962025316
602601,5,6303181929,"In reading the previous reviews on the Buns of Steel 2000 workout, I HAD to post my own review.  All of the Buns of Steel (Buns of Steel 2000 Step Workout, Thighs of Steel 2000, and this Buns of Steel 2000 version) are truly AMAZING.  I have been using the 3 of these (in addition to a couple other tapes) for about 10 years now (about 4 times a week) and it STILL makes me sore, at least while I'm doing the exercises.  After 10 years I still feel that the exercises are working.  And I can also see in how my body looks that they definitely are working.  I honestly can't believe anyone would have anything negative to say about any of the Platinum edition Buns of Steel workouts.  I find myself sweating and out of breath (signs that I'm getting a good workout) every single time I use them.  I can't say that about most other workout tapes.  If you don't have these and are looking for a good workout, get them while you can.  They really need to get them all on DVD.  I know my tapes won't last forever...",1140393600,5,1010,4.186528497409326
602602,5,6303181929,"I enjoy working out to this video, it's fun and easy yet you still feel the burn!!",1133913600,,82,3.8823529411764706
602603,3,6303181929,"I loved both Abs of Steel and Buns of Steel 7, both featuring Tamilee Webb, so I bought Buns of Steel 2000 with confidence.  Ooops!  I thought it was pretty bad.  The step aerobics segment is only twenty minutes long, not thirty as I was hoping.  The first third with Tamilee was okay, but the other two-thirds of the aerobics segment is led by two ladies who are simply not clear about how and when the moves are going to transition and what they are once you're doing them.  At one point, when Donna calls the moves it almost sounds like a joke, her instructions are so fast and meaningless (""Now right, now left, up-up, step-step..."")  The moves themselves ranged from decent, to silly, to unneccesarily complicated and inefficient.  In spite of all this, for variety I do use the tape, but I alter many of the moves from cha cha cha-ing to knee or leg lifts to make me cardio-challenged instead of chorus line ready.  I admit that I didn't look at the remainder of the tape, because I got the tape solely for its aerobic program.",1107475200,,1033,4.457446808510638
602674,5,6303181929,"I had this video in the early 90's along with several other Buns of Steel 2000 videos but gave them to my sister when I had my first baby since I didn't think I would ever have time to exercise again. The aerobic section in the first half makes you feel like you're dancing instead of exercising.  The toning section has great exercises and with three instructors alternating with their different styles, the workout doesn't get boring.  I am thrilled to have the Buns of Steel series back in my workout collection.",1043798400,6,515,4.586956521739131
602675,4,6303181929,"I have a collection of half a dozen workout tapes, but this is one of my favorites. The routines are interesting enough to do frequently. After you've been thru it a few times, you may find that the detailed instructions slow you down a bit, but not too much. The first half is warmup and aerobics, the 2nd half hour is toning and stretching, so its a nice mix and you can do the segments independently. Music is not obtrusive. Instructors are perky and easy to follow. I recommend having a pad/mat for the toning sections.",1037750400,5,523,4.458333333333333
602676,4,6303181929,"If you like to do aerobics and toning together and specifically want to work on your lower body, this tape may be for you.  Co-instructors Tamilee Webb, Donna Richardson, and Tracy York begin by each leading their own aerobics segments.  They utilize easy-to-follow dance moves, throwing in variations like a latin or funk beat.  After the aerobics section, you move on to the target toning for the lower body, begining with standing exercises (lunges, plies, etc.) and then eventually moving to the floor.  Again, each instructor leads you through a different segment of tough leg, hip, and [glutes] work.  The exercises themselves are nothing new, but they're clearly effective.  All three instructors provide very good cueing, but I found them each to be much more low key than they are on other tapes.  However, if you are looking for a basic aerobics and toning workout, you will probably like this tape.",1027641600,22,909,4.9801324503311255
602677,4,6303181929,"I've tried several aerobics tapes that are too hard to pick up the moves or changes pace too rapidly. This is the first one that I have stayed committed to. The steps are repetitious and new moves are gradually introduced so it is easy to learn and follow. The 1/2 hour of aerobics always leaves me sweating. After doing the toning portion for several weeks, I was excited to see I was starting to develop a six pack in my abs and a tigher tushy. The abs workout is pretty challenging and although effective, I wish they would have provided more buns toning. But overall, I enjoy this tape and do it several times a week for a great workout.",1026777600,11,641,4.35
602678,4,6303181929,"i've used this tape sporatically for years, and i'm only 20.  i used to run track in highschool, so i was always in excellent shape. when i graduated, at 17, and went to college...well the dorm food took it's toll...seriously!!  lemme tell you, if you do this tape 3 days a week for 2 weeks, consistently, then by the end of the third week you will see results.  your waist (front view) will narrow, your stomach(side view) will thin, and to dramatize the effect then your [behind] will begin to draw up and regain shapeliness (as opposed to a wide flat hanging buttox).  I love this tape, and whenever i slip up, i get on it.  At first it's hard, but it gets easier (even fun) every time!!",1018569600,17,690,4.359375
602679,5,6303181929,"Very good for beginners.
I liked the video very much, the only thing I wish was different is the time spend on aerobic exercises verses toning part. I wish the toning part was longer and aerobic shorter. I'm not an aerobic fan, so it just me. Great for beginners. Highly recomend.",1018137600,7,280,4.509803921568627
602680,3,6303181929,"I tried this tape for the first time last night.  I found the areobics section to be effective in getting my heart rate up.  The steps seem pretty easy, but took me a few tries to get it right.  When they start spinning around I got totally lost.
But they cut away at crucial points - I wish they would just have shot it all staight on. The toning hurt but I could tell it was doing something! It was difficult to differentiate tilting the pelvis ""with the buns"" versus ""with the abs"" but that's probabally just me.
 The worst parts: the use of the word ""buns"", the 80's cheesy music, the three women and their obnoxious banter, their THONGS (gross, give me a break!), and the camera work.  But I feel it today and I'm sure I'll learn to tone out the annoying bits after awhile.",1017360000,2,778,4.26530612244898
602681,5,6303181929,"..and it took me a couple of times to catch on to this video but now I absolutely *love* it!  I like that they're constantly giving reminders about good form-because it really makes all the difference in what kind of workout you get.  The steps are repeated a lot of times, so they're easy to catch onto, and very effective.  I also like the toning part--sometimes I find it's a little too short, but I add extra reps sometimes while they're explaining the next position.  All in all, I love the easy banter among the women and the encouragment throughout. I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't exercised in a while--but start slow and work your way up! :)",1013904000,,663,4.5
602682,5,6303181929,"I have purchased other work-out videos in the past and I have found this to be the best one on the market.  The steps are easy to follow.  The toning part is great, they give a lot of pointers ,advice and reminders. The more I used it the easier it became. So I added more arms and later on I added weights. It will be easy for those who are in shape. But to those who have not been active for a while or just had a child it's a challenging work out. I also remember the first time I did the work out and following it along was easy but, a bit tricky . They are good at letting you know what's next. But I also remember thinking this wasn't working... until I had to stop to get my crying baby. My legs felt like they have been running for miles. I am completed satisfied with my purchased.  And the compliments I recieve.",1012435200,3,822,4.0

7841432,4,6303181929,I bought this a long time ago and I love it. the other reviews just need to slow down and do one section at a time till they get the hang of it. I messed up quite a bit till I got the hang of it. Yes you will get a work out plus if you use weights in the aerobic part like I do then its even more of a challenge.

7841438,5,6303181929,The steps are easy. I needed that! They build on each other so you end up with a routine. It is a little bit dancy but I also like that. Kind of makes me think of line dancing. The toning segment is a good one too. The entire tape is great for beginners. I keep doing it because it keeps me at my current weight.,1410652800,,312,3.8153846153846156
7841439,5,6303181929,"I also have had this tape for many years.  As a person suffering from a chronic illness, I am always having to start over, to ""re-begin"".  Once you get the fairly easy routine down, you'll never forget it.  I just used it, after about three years of being bedridden, and I feel great!  I was only able to do about a fourth of it, but I am looked forward to getting back in the swing of things, and I know this tape will help.  It works out all your muscle groups, is not hard to do, and the girls aren't too cutsey.  Yes they are wearing the doofiest outfits, and yes they are chirpy, but it didn't bother me, knowing that I was getting a great workout!",1361232000,,653,4.102362204724409
