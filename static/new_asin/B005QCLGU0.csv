4858261,4,B005QCLGU0,"It's great that this fine film noir is finally out on DVD. One of the best of the ""ex GI hunts down murderers of his buddy"" genre that were prevalent in the immediate post WW2 era. Montgomery, a decorated USN vet himself, does an excellent job. He is ably assisted by Thomas (Key Largo)Gomez and Art Smith (In a Lonely Place). It was remade as ""The Hanged Man"" in the early 60s
which was not nearly as good as the original. I hope to pick up a copy of the DVD soon.",1419552000,48,465,4.065217391304348
4858262,4,B005QCLGU0,"The announcement of the release of this very good and previously very unobtainable rare noir is some of the best film noir news in awhile.  I was hoping someone would put out an at least half way decent  DVD of it , but to have the greatest movie restorers on the planet put it out is no less than fantastic news.  Thanks Criterion ! ! !  BTW , You can see the original trailer of this on You Tube if you haven't seen the film yet to get a little taste of it.  U P D A T E-.-- Most people who arrive at this film will get here because they like NOIR, have seen all of the Best Noirs such as ""Out Of the Past"" ""Double Indemnity"" Asphalt Jungle"" etc. as well as all the 2nd Tier Noirs like Fallen Angel, Nightmare Alley etc. and are hungry for more good Noir --- IMO  ""Ride The Pink Horse"" is not top tier Noir but its none the less still Very Good and extremely nice to watch & add to anyone's collection. --- WHILE I HATE SPOILERS without giving much away the plot framework is  Robert Montgomery plays a recently ex soldier on a revenge mission in the name of his murdered fellow soldier buddy ""Shorty"". --- Gagin  (Montgomery) starts out extremely obnoxious & rude to all he meets including the sweet  young mexican girl played by Wanda Hendrix. -- Fortunately later on he warms to her. --- IMO Thomas Gomez is the star of this flick & thus was the first Mexican to receive an academy award for his performance.  He plays the owner of the Merry go round which sports a pink horse for which the flick is named.  Gagin  and Poncho ( Gomez ) form a tight bond and friendship.  Poncho does everything he can to protect Gagin.  He takes whatever stress & abuse comes as a result of Gagins mission to take revenge on the bad guys. --- The flick starts out a little stiff and uneven  but keeps getting better and better as it progresses. ---- What I really like about it is it gives us a different look and feel compared to the majority of Noirs  --- I enjoyed the included commentary --- I enjoyed both the movie itself & the special features very much. --- As for the pic quality it is excellent as most Criterions are. --- The audio is decent but not phenominal. --- To me it's a 4 Star Flick.--- That said whether someone says a 4 Star Flick or a 5  Star Flick it doesn't matter.--- Either way it's a must buy for any serious fan of Noir--- I'm thrilled to finally be able to add a fantastic print of it on disc to my extensive Noir collection. ---Anyway hope this info helps you out.  --- Enjoy your Noiring",1419292800,53,2507,4.198329853862213

4858264,5,B005QCLGU0,"Montgomery directed this noir and also played the lead very successfully. It's a classic noir situation.
Man comes to a mexican bordertown to take revenge of a friend, who blackmailed a gangster. The
film has a strange noir mood with many great mexican actors/actresses. Montgomery is not the invincible
hero, he's just human. Hence the tension holds up 'til the end, when Montgomery Rides the Pink Horse.

  much poorer than this one,and I enjoy viewing that (has an excellent story set
  during the French revolution).",1345680000,2,380,4.681818181818182
4858268,1,B005QCLGU0,We love this movie but the quality of this DVD is VERY POOR.  The price for this quality is ridiculous. Don't waste your money. The movie itself is excellent. Too bad they didn't remaster it.,1337385600,15,191,4.457142857142857
4858269,3,B005QCLGU0,"I'm a fan of Robert Montgomery and, since he starred and directed this, I was really looking forward to it. On the Plus side: 1) luscious B&W cinematography, and 2) luscious Wanda Hendrix. On the negative side: 1) inexplicable title, 2) lack of suspense, 3) unsatisfactory ending (for this romantic movie goer).

First, the title. The Pink Horse is one of many on a carousel operated by Thomas Gomez. At one time in the movie, Wanda Hendrix asks Montgomery, ""Which horse should I ride?"" He answers, ""Ride the Pink one."" That's it! There is no other significance to the Pink Horse--at least in this film (I've never read the novel).

Secondly, the lack of suspense. This is a problem with a lot of film noir: there can only be suspense if you care about what happens to the characters. I didn't care what happened to Montgomery. When I read in the movie description that Montgomery was there to avenge his WW II combat buddy, ""Shorty"", who was murdered by a crime boss, I was interested. But Montgomery was NOT in this Mexican village to avenge Shorty: he was there to carry through Shorty's original plan of blackmailing the crime boss. Montgomery's character was a blackmailer, who ""redeemed"" himself in the end--not in the cause of justice, but simply to punish the crime boss. So I wasn't crazy about the storyline or the protagonist.

Thomas Gomez did a nice job, but his role was so over the top I was surprised to read that he was nominated for an Oscar. Wanda Hendrix (!) was a sight to behold, but her obsession with helping Montgomery was never adequately explained. The audience is led to expect a different kind of ending---and I found it a bit of a let down.",1462579200,4,1670,4.616161616161616

4858277,5,B005QCLGU0,"""Ride the Pink Horse""(1947) may not rank at the top of film noir classics from the 1940's such as ""Laura"" and ""Double Indemnity(both from 1944) and may have been overshadowed by ""Out of the Past"" which was released the same year, but it certainly comes close. Robert Montgomery's film of post-World War II disillusionment and one man's search for the killer of his war-time buddy might not be as memorable as the above named titles but that might change now that it has been released on Blu-ray. Criterion has finally brought this film to Blu-ray for the first time and the results are simply outstanding. According to the liner notes from the enclosed booklet: ""This new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution from a 35-mm nitrate fine-grain and safety duplicate negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed"". The results are very impressive and Criterion has given the film a high bitrate(34.98) which should more than please film noir fans. Cinematographer Russell Metty, who photographed other noir classics such as ""The Stranger""(1946), ""Kiss the Blood off My Hands""(1948) and ""Touch of Evil""(1958), brings out all the atmosphere of the sleepy(and sinister) New Mexico town with both interiors and exteriors being especially sharp and detailed on Blu-ray. Costumes are sharp looking especially the  pin-striped suit that Montgomery's character wears throughout the film as well as traditional Mexican clothing. Shadows during nighttime scenes are very prominent which add to the suspense and are well balanced with daylight scenes throughout the film. Actor/Director Montgomery deserves praise for bringing this all together and his role as an ex-GI named Gagin is one of the best of his career. Trouble comes after Gagin in the form of both mobsters and the FBI and Montgomery has assembled an excellent supporting cast to move the story along. Fred Clark, Thomas Gomez(Oscar nominated) and Art Smith are excellent in their supporting roles. But it is Wanda Hendrix who steals the picture with her heartfelt and commanding performance as Pila, the teenage Indian peasant girl who refuses to leave Gagin's side despite all the bad things that happen to him(and her) throughout the story. Only eighteen at the time of filming, Hendrix is simple outstanding and very believable as the innocent peasant girl with a heart of gold. The Audio(LPCM English) has been improved also. Again from the liner notes: ""The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical positive. Clicks, thumps, hiss, hum and crackle were manually removed"". Overall, Criterion has done another outstanding job in restoring this little known and overlooked  film which rightly deserves a place along side their recent Blu-ray releases of the film noir classics ""The Killers""(1946) and ""Night and the City""(1950). ""Ride the Pink Horse"" is 101 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.37:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include the following:  Audio commentary by film noir historians Alain Silver and James Ursini, interview with film noir author Imogen Sara, and a Lux Radio theatre adaptation of the film featuring stars Robert Montgomery, Wanda Hendrix and Thomas Gomez. Also included is an informative six page booklet by filmmaker Michael Almereyda. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in the standard clear(and solid) Criterion Blu-ray case. Criterion continues to be a leader in quality Blu-ray and DVD presentations for film collectors with ""Ride the Pink Horse"" being the latest outstanding example. It comes highly recommended.",1439164800,3,3641,5.339721254355401

4858290,5,B005QCLGU0,"Loved one of the best examples of film noir but has been available on DVD, blu ray no less.  Robert Montgomery plays a guy with a mission, and is perfect as a man out to avenge  his buddy by murdering  the guilty big boss, who happens to be a WWII grafter, an often played theme in this period shortly after the War, when vets came home wounded or with a grudge against those who made big money on the war.  Montgomery's Gagin does not let numerous numerous obstacles keep him from his goal.  The film has its little diversions, my favorite is Wanda Hendrix, who plays an innocent who helps Gagin and the FBI guy do the right thing in the end.  for the critic who faults the ending, I would agree its a little corny but unlike many film noirs, it has a ""noble"" ending, or you might say a patriotic ending. Not all film noirs end that way. Regrettably for someone I like  happy endings, corny as they may be.  Forgot to mention the make shift merry go round, owned by Gomez, who plays a likeable, believable accidental side kick.  Last point, is why don't films like this get the attention they deserve. Even at the height of the golden age a lot of films were subpar but are regularly shown on such networks as TCM, which does not sell or show this often.  Granted everyone has their tastes, but TCM should be a little more democratic.  Perhaps this film is not "";politically correct"". But if a film shows the way things were, its more accurate than trying to fit in fantasy.",1429920000,2,1475,4.346715328467154

4858293,5,B005QCLGU0,"A terrific film noir that transcends and overcomes the nihilistic, fatalistic tendencies of some late-40s noirs by demonstrating how a blackmailing lout--well-played by director Robert Montgomery-- can be saved from his own folly through the efforts of an innocent country girl (Wanda Hendrix), a drunken children's carousel operator (Thomas Gomez), and an aging, wizened  federal agent (Art Smith).  Hendrix in particular is wonderful-both poignant and funny--as the girl who sets out to  prevent Montgomery from suffering the fate she foresees for him.

The movie engrafts onto Dorothy B. Hughes's more pessimistic  source novel a fine moral: that the noble, selfless acts of even the most ordinary people can be a source, but not a guarantee, of hope and redemption.  Not a bad message for the post-modern  world.",1427587200,3,816,5.377952755905512
4858294,5,B005QCLGU0,"This review is for the recently released Criterion DVD of Ride The Pink Horse(1947). Criterion has come through again with this new 2K restoration of this classic Noir. I have been trying to purchase this title for years in a nice print and have been unsuccessful until now. Robert Montgomery both directs and stars in this excellent noir, which was based on the novel written by Dorothy B. Hughes. Montgomery plays a character simply called Gagin, a tough-talking former G.I., who comes to a small New Mexico town named San Pablo. Gagin, also known as ""the man from no place', is a war veteran with a cynical attitude, who is after a gangster named Hugo, well played by Fred Clark. Gagin essentially attempts to extort $ from Hugo, who has killed his best friend. Gagin, himself, claims that he is ""nobody's best friend"", as well as making it plain that he does not like ""hick towns"", like San Pablo. It also just happens to be Fiesta week in San Pablo and Gagin makes friends with a character named Pancho, who runs the carousel that holds the pink horse from which the title is taken. Pancho is played by Thomas Gomez, who became the first Hispanic actor to ever receive an Academy Award nomination for his excellent role. Gagin also unwillingly befriends a native girl named Pila, played by Wanda Hendrix. The cynical attitude of Gagin also attracts a FBI agent named Bill Reitz, played by Art Smith, who has his own agenda for tracking down Hugo. As the plot moves forward in the usual Noir style, all of the allies that Gagin somehow manages to make, Pila, Pancho, and Bill Reitz, all play increasingly important roles in aiding Gagin in achieving his objective. But I shall reveal no spoilers here in regards to plotlines. The excellent expressive cimematography is done by Russel Metty, featuring some elaborate dolly shots and long takes, which add greatly to the suspense of the film. In addition, the strong screenplay is written by noir veterans Ben Hect and Charles Lederer. All of the classic noir elements are prevalent here, which is strongly enhanced by all of the supporting players. With Criterion, of course, we receive some excellent Special Features, in addition to the pristine 2K digital restoration. There is an audio commentary featuring film noir historians Alan Silver and James Ursini. A new interview with Imogen Sara Smith, author of ""In Lonely Places:Film Noir Beyond The City"", which is very revealing as to exactly why this film is so exceptional within the classic noir canon. Les Radio Theatre adaptation of the film from 1947, featuring Robert Montgomery, Wanda Hendrix, and Thomas Gomez. Finally, a very well written essay by filmmaker and writer Michael Amereyda, which gives the film an excellent perspective as to specifically why the film is so exceptional. I cannot emphasize how pristine the Criterion restoration exactly is! After viewing many washed-out prints full of scratches and lines, seeing this was like finding a long-lost buried treasure! All true Film Noir lovers should be elated over this gem. The running time of the film is 101 minutes. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!",1427328000,5,3127,4.924242424242424
4858295,5,B005QCLGU0,"Ride the Pink Horse,"" set during a Mexican fiesta, stars (and is directed by) Robert Montgomery as ex-serviceman Lucky Gagin. Gagin plans to blackmail gangster Frank Hugo (Fred Clark) to avenge the death of his army pal. This melodrama is not very well known, but has many of the elements of classic film noir: the femme fatale (actually two of them), revenge motivation, a prevalent mood of fatalism and ever-present danger, black and white cinematography characterized by  exaggerated shadows, and an enigmatic protagonist.

Director Montgomery succeeds in providing exactly the right atmosphere, but actor Montgomery comes across like a second-rate Bogart, lacking the grit and mystery of a typical noir leading man. The title refers to a wooden horse on a carousel that figures significantly in the plot. All the actors turn in first-rate performances, but a stand-out is Thomas Gomez as the operator of the merry-go-round who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. The dialogue by Ben Hecht is especially crisp and clever, and the films cynical conclusion turns expectations of a happy Hollywood ending on its head.

Blu-ray bonus features include audio commentary by film historians, interview with the author of a book on film noir, 1947 Lux Radio Theatre adaptation featuring original stars Robert Montgomery, Wanda Hendrix and Thomas Gomez, and a critical essay.",1427241600,,1389,5.304545454545455

4858298,4,B005QCLGU0,"I don't quite know what to make of RIDE THE PINK HORSE (1947).

As an example of 1940s film noir, it does have some interesting aspects, such as a moral blackmailer for a hero and a lead heavy who is deaf.  With the exception of one bit of miscasting, the cast is excellent, particularly Thomas Gomez, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance.

On the other hand, star Robert Montgomerys direction lacks tension, the script by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer  is convoluted and the films climatic scene falls flat.

Montgomery plays a tough former GI who comes to a small town in New Mexico during its Fiesta Week to shakedown a gangster/war profiteer (Fred Clark) who killed his best friend.  He receives help from Gomez, who runs a childrens merry-go-round (thus the films title) and a strange Mexican girl from the country (Wanda Hendrix), yet they cant stop the violence that awaits him when he tangles with Clark and his gang.

Also in the cast are Andrea King and Art Smith, a fine actor, but too old and too small in stature for his role as the FBI agent who comes to Montgomerys rescue.

The 2K digital restoration in this Blu-ray release from The Criterion Collection looks terrific.  Extras include audio commentary from film noir historians Alain Silver and James Ursini, an interview with Imogen Sara Smith, author of IN A LONELY PLACE: FILM NOIR BEYOND THE CITY, and a LUX RADIO THEATRE adaptation featuring Montgomery, Hendrix and Gomez.  There is also a booklet, featuring an essay by filmmaker and writer Michael Almereyda.
