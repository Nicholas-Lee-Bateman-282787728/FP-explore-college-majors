1007991,4,6305295867,"*Add 1/2 of a star to my rating*
I rank this film up there with my other favorite documentaries such as the ""Up"" documentaries and Bud Greenspan's Olympic documentaries.  The film shows that racism is alive and well in our ""justice"" system.  I was particularly moved by the man who says he was falsely charged with rape and the parole board refuses to hear exculpatory evidence about his case.  This film will stick with you for a very long time.  It's a shame that consevatives who believe that prison is a joke filled with luxuries ignore films like this.
As a muslim, I wish they had shown the presence of Islam at Angola, for that reason I gave the film 4 1/2 stars.",989798400,3,670,4.4227642276422765
1007992,5,6305295867,"The Farm is easily the best documentary I have seen this year. It takes you on an  inside look into the lives of six inmates at Angola State Prison. Ironically Angola  was a slave plantation, it now is a maximum security prison. Not like  other prison  documentaries that I've seen. No  preachiness.  Just Powerful unintrusive film  making. Check this out. It's worth it.",962841600,6,371,4.7936507936507935
1007993,5,6305295867,"This outstanding look at the prison system was voted Best Documentary of 1998 by the three major critics groups, and it's easy to see why. You simply cannot walk away from ""The Farm"" without being touched by  it. Originally produced for the A&E cable network, ""The Farm""  went on to deservedly bigger and better things. It belongs in the company  of ""Paradise Lost..."", ""Crumb"", ""The Thin Blue  Line"", Spike Lee's ""4 Little Girls"" and ""Hoop  Dreams"" among other recent greats in nonfiction cinema.",959731200,8,497,4.9397590361445785
1007994,5,6305295867,"This documentary was screened in Australia approximately six months ago, and moved me so much that I have been trying to find a copy of the video ever since.  I also intend to write to each of the prisoners who appeared  in the film, but confess (with some shame) that I haven't yet gotten around  to it.
This film says a lot about the Louisiana 'justice' system (which I  obviously have many reservations about), but much more than that, it is  also a story about the human spirit.  The six men who bravely bare their  souls to the film makers are people from whom we can all learn something.  Please watch it, you won't be able to stop talking about it (and thinking  about it) for a very long time.  I know that I've discussed this film at  pretty much every dinner party I've been to since I saw it.",950400000,,803,4.286666666666667
1007995,5,6305295867,This is simply a great film.  I was touched by the film's balanced depiction of both the prison staff and the inmates.  I especially enjoyed the in-depth interviews with several men serving time in Angola. Deep  social questions are raised that are difficult. I think this film can help  stimulate a helpful discussion of how to handle crime in our country.  There has to be a better way than Angola.,941932800,5,400,4.6571428571428575
7887418,5,6305295867,"Riveting documentary on life inside one of the US' most notorious prisons.  Filmed entirely within the Angola State Prison in south central Louisiana the film follows a half dozen inmates serving various sentences for serious crimes.  Unlike many current prison series, THE FARM is a relatively objective look at the daily life of those incarcerated for life sentences, and an unflinching look at the prisoners, the prison staff, and the blatantly expedient parole commission.  There's no violence, shouting, or histrionics- just an emotional and rare look at those who commit terrible crimes and their acceptance of fate.  Superb.",1435536000,,631,5.408163265306122

7887420,5,6305295867,"I had this as a VHS and have spent years looking for a DVD so was happily surprised when I finally came across it. It's not a ""feel good"" documentary. Angola is the end of the line for most prisoners and that's what this shows. . These are not guys who have been ""railroaded"" and did nothing wrong. Some of them are downright scary but their humanity DOES come across.",1364947200,,368,4.271428571428571
7887421,5,6305295867,I learned so much from watching this film- it definetly provokes criticial thinking about the underside of some correctional insititutions and the linkages to the issues that our country has suffered from (race and class).,1358812800,,222,5.371428571428571
7887422,5,6305295867,"I teach high school and show this film (The Farm and The  Farm 10 Down) every year as part of our non-fiction unit.  The kids start out disgusted that I am showing a documentary but it captures their interest quickly and they are sad to see it end! They talk about it off and on for the rest of the year! I think a good dose of reality is a good thing for them to see... it also allows them to form opinions on various topics (innocent men in prison, the death penalty, life of crime, paying the price for committing crimes, etc.) and to see the side that they so rarely see - that of the prisoner.  They appreciate the honesty and the raw emotions shown.  This is one film that I never get tired of seeing, even after showing it to my students for the last 7 years!",1350432000,8,766,4.086666666666667
7887423,5,6305295867,One of the very best documentaries I have seen.  I watched when it was originally broadcast in the late 90s.  I had been looking for it quite a while. Very interesting and informative.,1341446400,4,184,4.545454545454546
7887424,5,6305295867,"This is one of the best prison documentaries I've seen: thought-provoking, real, and upsetting. I was relieved to learn that one prisoner, so obviously falsely-accused and revictimized by a racist parole panel for 20+ years, was later released after a public outcry when this documentary first aired. I have a homemade VHS of this program and would like to replace it but am not willing to pay $40 + shipping for another VHS. Wish it would come out on DVD.",1224720000,2,456,4.7125
7887425,1,6305295867,"This shows how easy life is on the inside and why should it be made easy for them? These people have killed,rapped,etc..I would say bring back the electric chair and let me pull the switch on them all.",1210723200,,201,4.315789473684211
7887426,5,6305295867,"If you believe in the death penalty, watch this film.

I saw this film a few years ago and it permanently changed my view on the prison systems in the U.S. Highly recommended viewing.

It is annoying how such an important film is so rare and high priced.

I'd also recommend ""Crime control as industry: Towards gulags"" for further understanding of some of the statistical data and financial mechanics that fuel the corrupt prison systems in the U.S. and elsewhere.",1100563200,5,464,4.775
7887427,5,6305295867,"This film is free of Hollywood glamour, and you love it for just that reason.  It's a great documentary, and definitely worth the price.  About 15 minutes into the film you get that weird sensation in your throat, and have trouble swallowing.  Everything becomes clear, from now on you'll be a preacher boy just to keep clear of Angola, and anything that could resemble it.",1008806400,6,373,4.707692307692308
