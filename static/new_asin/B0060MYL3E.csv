4912832,4,B0060MYL3E,"It's that time again.  That overwhelming build up of anticipation can only mean the start of a new season of Breaking Bad.  It's hard to believe that it's only been eight months since the season four finale yet every important plot point, every dialogue still remains fresh in my mind.  It's a testament to how well written this show is.  I've purchased the past four seasons with the season pass from another competitor but have been leaning towards getting season five from Amazon simply due to the poor customer service I've experience with ""the other guys"" in the past (episodes being 2-3 days late without explanation).  For me, the season pass is the way to go.  No commercial breaks, HD quality, no space taken up on your DVR, and the accessibilty to watch it on your laptop next to your bed or at the airport.  Now if only there was smart phone access...",1342396800,2,862,4.594771241830065

Without a doubt, nothing has every been written or filmed like this series, and I can think of no television show, no Hollywood blockbuster, no Indie film, that can come close to this brilliance.  It's not pretty but it is amazing.",1342224000,50,396,4.549295774647887

If any trite cliche could sum it all up it would be...Lawyers, Guns & Money.  Die hard fans, fear not...a spin-off featuring Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (AKA Jimmy McGill) is now 3 seasons in on AMC, creators of Breaking Bad.  I have seen the first two and they are hilariously dark, and a true bit of comic relief after the horror of Breaking Bad.  A lot of people thought Jimmy McGill was sealed the deal for Breaking Bad.

I never get tired of watching it countless times. They actually have a ""Breaking Bad"" trolley tour here in the ABQ. I took a short tour of ABQ which showed Jesse Pinkman's house and places along Central Ave. (The Dog House). If you are ever in Burque, I recommend the long tour.

4913068,5,B0060MYL3E,"(-)Why is the new strategy to get you hooked on a TV show, or purchases thereof, and then split the purchasing in two for the final seasons of something. I hate that, and has gotten me NOT to buy several iterations of TV shows on DVD or BluRay. I hate being toyed with, financially. Like a drug dealer that gives FREE tastes of drugs and then the horror pricing hits you after addiction.

(+)OK, enough on the negative, great TV show from AMC. The subject matter is dark, whether dark drama or dark humor. Not everyone is going to find this a diamond in the rough, but maybe just a zircon diamond. I think it is wonderful either way. People thrown in to desperate circumstances, which only makes the desperation more dire by their actions. Lies upon more lies, and illegal doings, by a mild mannered family-man school teacher devolving into a hellish world. Bryan Cranston and others won several awards during this shows run, and deservedly so.

This is the first of a volumes 1-2 with 8 episodes, and a final 8 episodes follow later. The show has one of the best endings ever, because it crosses all the T's and dots all the I's for a complete ending scenario. So buy this and the follow up 8 episodes. Great TV!!

4913070,3,B0060MYL3E,"Impressive series of episodes following the demise of Gus, but I have to admit that the pacing feels a little slow. Understandably they were building up to the massive conclusion in the final season, but this season, with the bug-exterminator gimmick used to cook meth, there just wasn't as much of an edge to it, and the biggest issue seemed to be characters wanting to call it quits. The strained marital relationship with Skyler White also really grows tedious by this point - I mean, I understand passive-aggressive behavior but really, is she still mad at this point?
This was a decent season but not one of the better ones.",1483920000,,629,4.7272727272727275

4913170,5,B0060MYL3E,"This season also explores all the consequences Walter White meets after his long lasted drug producing years. He attempts to undo the mess he's created over the past four seasons in this final season. The suspense is overwhelming as the determined Hank Schrader try's to bust Walter White. The scene where Hank confronts Walter White and tells him he knows he is Heisenberg is perfect. There are also many different emotions you will experience this season. There are many deaths to characters that have been there sense season one. Which makes it sad when they die due to Vince Gilligan's great character development over the last four seasons. You get really attached to these characters.
 Just as I did with the breaking bad series. After watching ever season I came to the conclusion that season five was my favorite. I give it a five stars out of five due to its great acting, production and story.  I think every viewer will be satisfied with this season just like all the others, and I believe Vince Gilligan put together a timeless masterpiece that will be remembered and loved forever.",1475452800,,1094,4.8138297872340425

4913174,3,B0060MYL3E,"First 4 seasons were great.  I wondered about season 5 since season 4 ended without a cliffhanger. I was right. Season 5 tried too hard to keep the story going. It's not bad, it's just that the character motivations and even their personalities changed a bit to fit the narrative needed to make season 5 somewhat plausible. It's still entertaining, but it doesn't leave you with the craving to watch the next episode as much as the first seasons of the show.",1474329600,,458,4.585365853658536

Truly a great one to binge watch too, as so much happens in the five season's that is actually taking place in a much shorter time period per the story arc. It is a ""wild ride"" of a series and the acting/writing/directing/staging/filming is consistently exceptional across the board.",1444521600,2,411,4.802816901408451

If you aren't ""hooked"" by the end of Season 1, maybe you should be watching baseball or golf, LOL.  We bought Seasons 1, 2, and 3 before buying the rest, just to see if we would like the series.  If I had it to do all over again, I'd buy the complete series up front and save a few bucks.  It's like a book that you just can't put down.  We liked it better than Mad Men.

I am not enamored of violence and generally avoid movies which are violent so everyone in my family was surprised when I told them I loved BB. I think the story line and the writing and the character development got me through it. Being able to watch it at home on our own TV at our own pace meant that I could walk away from the very violent parts and come back to it later. I loved Jesse's character and was so sad at all the things that happened to him in the story. (see how I get involved in characters!!) Truly, he was a young guy who had a lot of bad luck happen and some stupidity but the writer got all the nuances of youth correct, and the way Jesse interacts with the main characters was really excellent. I don't think there will every be a series quite as exciting and overpowering as this one. If you haven't watched it all, do so. You will not be disappointed",1430352000,,969,4.21505376344086

The robbery is supposed to take place somewhere between Long Beach and Texas, and somehow Walt manages to get back home where Skylar comments on his dirty clothes, then ends up back where they do the robbery in the next scene.  No biggie, I guess they just decided any reference to getting there and back wasn't important, but its just the only thing I've ever noticed in regards to continuity.",1429833600,,557,4.4411764705882355

4915028,5,B0060MYL3E,"Breaking Bad is the best television series I've seen in a long time. The characters are fully developed (and that doesn't happen often on television). The series should appeal to everyone from the least sophisticated to the most. It is a highly nuanced, subtle moral story. The  transformations in the characters are exceptionally well executed. The actors are uniformly excellent but special credit has to go to Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Actually, all the major characters are excellent actors. This is a remarkable show in every respect. Vince Gilligan, who created it, is some kind of genius. (This review includes all seasons of the show.)",1427760000,3,648,5.113207547169812

4915186,4,B0060MYL3E,"Having removed the problems caused by Gus Fring and his criminal empire, Walter White is now an independent operator. Aided by the increasingly guilt-riven Jesse, Walter cooks extravagant amounts of meth and distributes it with the reluctant help of his ex-wife. However, the DEA is continuing its investigation into ""Heisenberg"" and Walter becomes increasingly desperate - and lethal - in covering his tracks.

The final season of Breaking Bad was split in half to give the writers and actors more time to prepare the grand finale of the story. When you're making what a lot of people are calling the greatest TV show ever made, taking some extra time to give it a good send-off is a good idea. However, it does leave the penultimate chunk of the series in a little bit of limbo, with some wheel-spinning to do before the explosive ending can arrive.

The result is probably the weakest run of episodes in the Breaking Bad canon, although this is still very relative. Certainly the show remains almost as well-acted and well-written as ever, with a few more clumsy moments than normal. An odd moment with Walter going Don Corleone and pompously declaring that he forgives his wife for a perceived betrayal feels like self-parody, and early episodes with Mike and Jesse declaring they are out of the meth business, then back in, and then out again feel a little redundant. New character Lydia is also under-utilised, which is a shame as they cast the superb Laura Fraser in the role and gave her some good moments but then nothing more to do.

On the flipside, the show gives us one of its most memorable moments in the train heist episode. Although completely implausible, it is rollicking good fun and capped off by a disturbing, powerful ending that sets the tone for the end of the season (and the whole show). Dean Norris does a great job as Hank finally seems to be easing off from his pursuit of Heisenberg, right up until a masterfully-executed plot revelation leaves the half-season on one hell of a cliffhanger.

The first half of the fifth season of Breaking Bad (****) is the show at its most stretched-out, but it mostly avoids problems by coming back strong after every weaker moment with a powerfully-written scene or piece of dialogue. Events build to a memorable finale which sets things up for the conclusion.",1425600000,,2327,4.795511221945137

4915188,5,B0060MYL3E,"Brilliant writing and acting, inventive ideas, surprising developments, even a heist!  As the series enters the home stretch, everything changes in the wake of Gus death.

It used to be easy to root for Walt.  He was the weak person finding strength, the underdog, a dying man wanting to provide for his family, a man desperate to survive. We could understand his actions, even support some of them to an extent.  But now, much of the basis for sympathizing with him is gone. His character isn't quite so appealing now that he reigns supreme and treats others as tools for his use.

Jesse won my admiration this season by finally pulling himself together and steering himself toward a hopeful future.

As for Skyler, her character changes dramatically, but not in a way that wins me over.  Every time I think I might change my mind about her, she says or does something to destroy any possibility of sympathy.  She adamantly refuses to trust Walt and resorts to ploys to get her way.  She condemns him without bothering to learn all the facts.

Skyler has always treated Walt as a fixture rather than a mate.  She supports The Family and he is a part of that, but not someone shes treated with genuine warmth and affection.  She is only comfortable when she has control.  She won't work WITH Walt, discussing concerns in a manner that allows him to help.  She simply makes up her mind and that is that.

The season ends with a cliffhanger that you cant wait to see followed up.

Only eight more episodes left!!",1425340800,,1510,4.599250936329588
4915189,5,B0060MYL3E,"Breaking Bad is the greatest story every put to screen. It is as epic as a Greek classic. It is as audacious and risk taking as any film I've seen. To take a truly liked and supported protagonist, and walk him through a deterioration of the soul step by step, to the depths of a dark abyss, becoming a murderous evil mastermind, is an accomplishment I've never seen done by any story teller on screen. It was masterful. Walter White goes from beloved father and teacher, to a disgusting abuser and ruthless killer on par with any villain. And the storytellers do this without gaps, jumps, hiccups, or shenanigans.

Furthermore, Breaking Bad is a collection of the best of all creative aspects in film. Composition, dialogue, plot, acting, music, innovation and fresh styles, action, intensity, humor, pain and suffering, the agony of the soul, this story has it all, times 10.",1425340800,,876,4.801324503311259

4915587,5,B0060MYL3E,"Yes, this is only an 8 episode season, and for contractual reasons season 6 was called the 2nd half of season five, even though they were shot a year apart and have very different parts of the storyline.

But this is still 8 hours of amazing storytelling. I'd take 8 hours of the very best of 'Breaking Bad' over 12 hours of almost any other series in TV history. To worry too much about 4 fewer episodes is like being upset because a great 90 minute movie costs the same as a great 2 hour film.

What can be said about this spectacular saga that hasn't been said before? One of the very few series that competes with the best films in history for achievement in cinematic storytelling.  Like a great novel slowly unfolding, it's funny, heartbreaking, incredibly tense, deeply disturbing, full of brilliant plot twists, rich, compelling characters and a pitch-black sense of humor.

A nebbishy high-school science teacher finds he has lung cancer, so becomes a meth dealer to make money for his family before his death. Often visually stunning, with a breathtaking performance by Brian Cranston in the lead, and great work from all the supporting roles, this portrait of a man's decent into hell couldn't be much better, and it just grows darker and more disturbing each year.

In a way, thematically it recalls ""The Godfather I and II"" in how that epic charts Michael's journey from innocence to darkness, along with the moral murkiness of the endless drive for money and success - how we lose ourselves, so that succeeding and having ever more becomes an
end in itself for which we will pay any price, rather than a route to happiness, trapping us in a game we can never win.

This fifth season is a brilliant, and very emotional set up for the last. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff.",1418256000,,1811,4.679245283018868

4916086,5,B0060MYL3E,"Walter White completes his transformation from high-school chemistry teacher to meth producing megalomaniac in this final season of Breaking Bad. No sugar coating here, the meth business is brutal. Starting with the aftermath of Walt's wiping out of his boss, Gus, and continuing the apex of Walt's career, this season shows just how ugly the business is. And ugly is hardly the word when you see how people are used, abused, and die at the hands of people bent by their own greed and ego trips. There are no prisoners in this game and no winners either. Of course the writing, direction, and acting in this series are all brilliant. Characters are multi-dimensional, deep as the far end of the ocean, and carefully drawn to show all the nuance of human depravity. In some ways, I was glad to see the show end because some of the mindless brutality weighed heavily. Nonetheless, this is the drug trade writ large and small with tragedy around every corner.

4916184,3,B0060MYL3E,"OK, review #3,560 here. Hope I can offer something fresh. Here goes:

Given the popularity of this series, of course, it went on for another season. Doing it as two half-seasons is just plain dumb especially when you're paying $22 for a DVD box set and get only eight episodes. Another problem is after you watch this 1/2 season, you realize they could have ended ""Breaking Bad"" after Season Four and left the futures of those still alive to our imagination. It really would have worked.

Even so the positives are Jesse becomes the moral compass and matures a ton and Mike gets far more screen time now Gustavo Fring is gone. I still don't buy the Mike and Walt meeting by the river at all. Sorry, but a pro like Mike would not be THAT dumb given all that we know and have seen about him. That's all I'm saying. Just watch, and you'll see what I mean.

OK, but given we go into the post-Gustavo Fring era, I have so many problems with the setup. You're telling me no other drug cartel would step into the vacuum? I mean, it's not like Fring's empire stopped at New Mexico's borders. Also, we're back to family angst and it just does zip for me. After Seasons Three and Four really ramped it up and finally Skyler became semi-interesting, I'm back where unless Jesse and Walt are talking to each other, I'm tuning out. Sorry, I just am.

As far as the extras, besides the usual commentary tracks, behind ""Breaking Bad"" and deleted scenes on most, Disc 1 has a Benny Hill sped-up writer's room time lapse thing without the Benny Hill music and audition tapes of a couple of newcomers--Landry (or Lance as Coach Taylor often referred to him) from ""Friday Night Lights"" is now on the series and he's decent plus this Lydia character who's apparently the one who shipped the meth all over the place for Fring's empire. She's super annoying as a character and seems frankly totally implausible. She plays paranoid and neurotic way too hammy and over the top.

Disc 2 has a gag reel which is so-so, the behind-the-scenes of the clever train scene that is in one of the episodes and an art gallery show of ""Breaking Bad"" art which is very cool.

Disc 3 has a very intriguing exclusive scene that did not air in the episodes but fills you in on how Jesse's character. There's a nice interview with Jonathan Banks who plays Mike the Cleaner. His role is much bigger in Season 5.half and I'd have to agree with his idea (SPOILER alert...sort of) how Mike should leave the show vs. what actually happens. The Chris Hardwick's (who?) Celebrity All-Star Bowling is fantastic with the cast taking on these Hardwickians and comedy ensues. Lastly, there is a stunt rehearsal extra for one of the major scenes (not giving this away) in the latter episodes that really shows you how much fun it must be to shoot these coordinated scenes.

Anyway, it may have been better to review the actual episodes after watching the final eight episodes and then coming back to this.",1407715200,,2952,4.548022598870056

This show may not be for everybody because of the subjects that it deals with. Its not for kids! I must say, however, that it is the best show I have probably ever seen. The writers are nothing short of genius. The actors are incredible and click in a way not seen often. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and wondering what lies ahead and the eventuality. I find myself pondering these things all the time just to see if I can come close to figuring out what happens.

As for Amazon and the marketing, I feel like I got double-dipped. I bought seasons 3,4 and The Final Season. I watched all episodes of the Final Season, not realizing that I entirely missed the first half of season 5! Paid full price for the Final Season, watched it, then realized why I wasn't getting it.

I couldn't have been more wrong.  It was, in all actuality, a morality play.  Although the series is quite violent in parts, I believe it's probably pretty true to life where the drug cartels are conserned.  The acting is supberb, the actors very real.

4916472,5,B0060MYL3E,"By 2012, ""Breaking Bad"" was a cultural phenomenon--most people who had never watched the show had probably at least heard of it.  Viewership was up sharply for these eight episodes originally broadcast on AMC in the summer of 2012--the decision was made to split the final season into two parts, and this DVD set contains the first half of Season Five.

These episodes see more outstanding writing and plot twists--Walter (Bryan Cranston), Jesse (Aaron Paul), and the other characters at times want to break free of each other and from their life of crime but are unable to do so.  Walt's pride makes several more appearances, as he is clinging to the meth business as a means of reversing past life defeats.

As has been the case throughout, Walt's relationships with the other characters have their ups and downs, and the amusing cliffhanger of these episodes points toward the final resolution in the last episodes of the series.  And as always, there are the scenic shots of the New Mexico desert that provide a superb setting for ""Breaking Bad.""

Special features on this DVD set include brief commentary by series creator Vince Gilligan and some of the lead characters.  The first half of Season Five of ""Breaking Bad"" won the 2013 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, and set the stage for an unforgettable final eight episodes of the television series that many critics claim is one of the best ever.",1398902400,,1422,4.851239669421488

I have LOVED ALL the first four seasons, they are PERFECT five star seasons, and I HIGHLY recommend them and was completely, totally, and utterly crazily engaged and into them, season four however made a HUGE mistake, a couple actually, the main mistake I felt was the same thing that ruined a few seasons of the show House which is when the main character has been made into an absolute jerk! I HATE that, I mean I really disliked Walt through nearly this entire season, he was utterly rude and awful, now to the point of me hating him, but he got so out his usual character that I was furious when Walt killed Mike! I LOVE Mike, Walt should NOT have become a murderer for no good legitimate reason, he was so cruel this season, I almost gave this is three, however, there was one really star gaining greatness, and that is the very last episode of this season, when Hank finally figures out Walt is Heisenberg, that was a great episode, and this is a very good season, but not the perfection that the first four were.

I have to say, the first couple of episodes of Breaking Bad Season One were a bit dry, and I almost didn't finish watching, but then something captured me.  After I got into the story, I was so glad that it was on DVD, so that I didn't have to wait a week to see the next episode on AMC.  I was borrowing the DVDs from the library, but decided I couldn't wait for the hold for Season 5, and purchased it.  I'm not one to watch a movie or show twice, but this series has so many things I want to look at again (differently, maybe the second or third time), that I am going to purchase the rest of the series too.

I had seen the main actor with the shaved head and thought ""I'm not interested"".  Well, as many, many people have said I started to finally watch it this past Jan. of 2014 and was immediately if not sooner hooked on it.  All of the characters are extremely talented actors and you get taken in by their authenticity.  I spent 3 weeks ""Binge Watching"" as they call it.  My jaw dropped at the end of each episode, not wanting it to end and anxiously waiting for the credits to go by so I could get into the next one.  Believe it or not, I still haven't completed the series as of yet because Netflix just put the final episodes on and I'm trying to nurse myself along so I don't stay up one night and devour them.  There hasn't been one episode that has disppointed me at all.  If anything I'm more anxous then ever to watch it.  BRAVO to Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul (yo), Anna Gunn, Dean Norris and all the rest of the stunning performers.  Thank you for making TV a viable creature.  I love it and am going to order the DVD so I can see the 5 comedic episodes and the commentaries that I just saw are availabe.",1393372800,,1217,4.247826086956522

Otherwise, this is one of my FAVORITE shows of all time.  Great writing, fantastic characters, interesting pace and entertaining dark comedy mixed in with the serious 'evil' of drug lords.  I would recommend to adults; not for young viewers (but I'm old fashioned that way) and if you ever make it past the first episode you'll be hooked forever.",1393372800,,858,4.4113924050632916

From the jaw dropping opening Pilot (""I only had you in my heart."") to the heartbreaking Felina, the quality of the five seasons never once dropped from Perfect.

I could go on. I could talk about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bryan-Cranston/dp/B006W0QOF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bryan Cranston</a>'s legendary, immortal performance as high school-teacher-turned-meth-chef Walter White. I could talk at length about the jaw-dropping work from Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, and Bob Odenkirk in their moving, finely crafted roles. I could talk about the perfect use of music and lighting, the camera work and stunning cinematography. I could talk about the writing, sharp and realistic and beautiful. All these and more are the elements (this IS a show about chemistry...) that took Breaking Bad from what it could have been: an entertaining black comedy/drama, into what it is: ""a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell"" of Shakespearean proportions (words of B.B. superfan Anthony Hopkins).

But I won't talk about that. I'll just say one thing: watch Breaking Bad. Watch all 57 perfect episodes of it, and when you're done, come back here and drop a comment telling me what you thought.

4916696,5,B0060MYL3E,"Breaking Bad is one of those rare shows where I never find myself saying, ""This episode really sucks.  The show has gone downhill"".  Every episode perfectly showcases Walt's transformation from good father and science nerd into murderer and meth lord.  This show is more than just entertainment, it's truly thought provoking and forces you to consider your own moral code against the circumstances each of these characters finds themselves in.  It's easy to judge them because, after all, almost everything that happens is a consequence of someone's choice, but what you do?  At almost any point in the show's 5 seasons, it's easy to find an alternative, but what the show's writers have done so well is paint the characters into an emotional corner.  Sometimes, doing the right thing means losing the one you love.  Sometimes, getting rid of the one you love is the only right thing to do.  Other times, all you can think about is violence, and your rage makes you irrational.  The brilliance of the show, and the reason you need to watch season 5, is that the whole thing is inevitable, a chemical reaction with unknown quantities, but by the time you see the end credits for the final time, it's clear that there could never have been another ending.",1392508800,,1253,4.790697674418604

4916714,5,B0060MYL3E,"For a long time now, television programs have been making great strides in terms of quality, production values and acting. Some of the shows we've been seeing in recent years really are prime examples of what can happen when you marry exceptional stories to inspired acting. The old bias against ""the ghetto of television"" is being eroded more with every passing year, and one show that deserves a large amount of credit for that turnaround is Breaking Bad.

  Bryan Cranston is so wonderful as chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin Walter White that his performance could easily obscure the other actors in this series...but the majority of them are so perfectly cast that you just can't help but marvel how wonderful they are. From Dean Norris as DEA agent (and brother-in-law to Walter) Hank Schrader to Walt's long-suffering partner in crime Jesse Pinkman, a heart-breakingly vulnerable Aaron Paul, this show rarely misses. And even the odd average bit of acting you see here and there ends up being elevated by how truly magnificent the material is.

  Breaking Bad gets a lot of comparisons to Scarface. Never having watched that movie in its entirety, (I have a hard time with Al Pacino's accent) I can neither confirm nor deny the validity of that statement, but what I CAN tell you is that this is a gripping tale of a seemingly mild-mannered man who, through a twist of fate, discovers the villain within and discovers too, his genius, and we see just how much he will let go of in pursuit of the gratification of his ego. Conversely, his partner Jesse, who starts the series as a petty drug dealer, finds that as Walt becomes increasingly distant from his morality, Jesse realizes just how close his always was.

  From the cat-and-mouse between Walt and Hank to the complex relationship that exists between Walt and his wife and children, to the string of adversaries that Walt faces in his rise to the top, there is nothing in this show that isn't handled beautifully. If it seems like I'm gushing, it's because I am. I can't say enough good things about this show. It is, by turns, suspenseful, blackly humorous, and touching, often all at the same time. Very few stories strike this balance, and even fewer do it as well as Breaking Bad.

  If you haven't seen this series yet, whether it's because you've felt like you just couldn't fit in one more, you haven't made the time, or you haven't any idea what all the fuss was about...do yourself a favor: watch it. Very few things in life live up to the hype. This does.",1391817600,2,2533,4.705882352941177
4916715,3,B0060MYL3E,"It was clear at the end of the 4th season that breaking bad was going out of breath... The scenario was coming more tortuous and less and less credible.

You end up loving and hating almost each character throughout the show.  It's like watching an old western...sherrif vs. the outlaw.  The director is amazing as well.  The camera shots and angles cause for a very beautiful picture and is very pleasing to the eye.

4916950,5,B0060MYL3E,"""Breaking Bad"" is truly worthy of the many accolades heaped onto it.  It is a brave and bold study of evil, and it is a rich and densely-layered universe with many complex and interesting characters who often overshadow Walter and Jesse.  And, best of all, it knows when the show must come to an end, and while the ending is a bit too tidy it is nevertheless a cathartic and delightful resolution to the entire series.

I will simply point out a few problems I found with the final season:
1.)  Hank's discovery that Walter is Heisenberg, and his violent fanatical response is not at all believable.  Human nature dictates that we seek self-preservation through self-denial, and Hank's entire world would have collapsed if he went after Walter, and so instinctively he would mentally tried to block out the possibility.  It would have much more believable, much dramatic, and ultimately more powerful to have Walter going out of his way to get caught, and Hank going out of his way to ignore all the obvious signs and doing whatever he could to protect Walter out of self-preservation.
2.)  Walter's loyalty and devotion to Jesse is not at all believable.  Jesse is a meth-head, and known to be emotionally volatile.  Walter could have two psychological reasons for being loyal to Jesse.  One is that Jesse was like a surrogate son -- but that's kind of shaky because Walter is already too invested in his current son.  Two is that Walter wanted to get caught -- but he had shown himself too cautious and circumspect everywhere else.  Walter's relationship with Jesse is the most troubling aspect of the entire series.
3.)  There's really too much over-acting in this series.  People do not become loud and angry when faced with traumatic truths or events -- they become cold and aloof, as a form of psychological protection and shield.  I know there's been a lot of accolades thrown at Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul for their over-acting, but I believe the most effective performance in the series belongs to Giancarlo Esposito, who in his understated performance also delivered the most powerful.",1388620800,,2098,4.837535014005602

If you're going to sell something that says 'season' it in then it should include all of the season, not half of it. I buy tons off of Amazon and never return anything, except for this so-called 'season'. It's not Amazon's issue either, it's the company producing it, which says Sony on the page. This product should have been clearly labeled as Season 5  pt 1, period. You shouldn't have to scroll down half a page to see it is only half of the fifth season.",1386028800,2,636,4.213114754098361

Jonathan Banks as ""Mike"" gives a remarkable and unforgettable performance in this season. I loved his character in this, probably my favorite of this season. Also noteworthy is Dean Norris as Hank, Walter White's brother-in-law DEA agent. He is excellent, both funny and very serious in his pursuit of ""Heisenberg"".

4917175,2,B0060MYL3E,"just discovering this series, started with this episode cause checked it out from the library, initially turned off because it's about meth, I hate illegal drugs, but saw the positive reviews and gave it another shot. it's okay, not really believable. first, knowing nothing about meth, I see this middle age, very friendly caucasian man being super nice to a middle age lady who lets him into a room and he puts alot of cash in boxes, not sure what that's about, but I see he brings her treats. anyway, next time he goes to what I guess is a bank (?), the woman's behavior is markedly, noticeably subdued, and as he's a criminal, thought it weak (storywise) that he didn't notice her changed reaction to him (bringing her more treats, where initially she was very enthusiastic) enough to change his behavior.

I mean, he's a criminal, and it seems to me a criminal would always have their antenna up for busts. people might justify their choices, and give themselves excuses, but a person breaking the law to the extent this attorney was, would know they'd be in serious trouble, especially in a location where bunches of cash are being left, so any change would have been noticed. He noticed it, but apparently didn't understand what it meant, i.e., that cops where there. dumb characters aren't interesting. it's not that criminals aren't busted, but it would've been much more believable had the attorney noticed the lady's noticeably altered behavior, understood it meant he was in trouble, and then attempted to get out of the bank (?, whatever the place was), and then gotten busted anyway, as he tried to leave the premises.  in the real world a criminal knows they're a criminal and would know the authorities are on the hunt for them, especially with increased anti-terrorist monitoring. just think, illegal drugs could be a source of income for terrorists, and the government would know that, and the drug people would know it too.

second, the mastermind meth maker has a brother in law who's a DEA officer and said meth maker visits his brother in law at work and just happens to overhear an important  piece of information being discussed regarding the meth guy's own business (officer doesn't know his brother in law is a meth mastermind). just don't buy that officers would discuss an ongoing drug investigation in front of a civilian. though I could be wrong, just found that unbelievable.

also, related to that, found the meth guy's brother in law who is a DEA officer too naive, I don't know how to put it, he seemed too uncynical to be an officer. now granted I know only one police officer, my father, now retired. my parents separated when I was months old and both went on to marry multiple times and my dad was a security officer for years before he became a police officer, and we lived across the country from one another and he almost never discussed police work with me (I don't remember but I think he may have become a policeman when I was in my 20s or 30s, and his main tip to me was to be aware of my surroundings), but the big takeaway from my dad is that officers generally see the negatives of human behavior and don't tend to romanticize human behavior. so that's what I mean by saying this officer seemed naive. incredible to me that he would not know all the major drug criminals in his territory - understandable that he wouldn't know all the small time operations, but the major ones, he and his entire organization should know that. my Dad didn't discuss this with me, but I'm assuming that criminals are called criminals because they're in trouble with the law and as such they'd be trying to get out of jail/prison, giving info on other illegal activities, in other words, snitching (which I remember from Starsky & Hutch), so it seems highly unlikely to me this meth kingpin would be unknown to local and national law enforcement, so didn't buy that part of the story. even if this guy had the most loyal workers, he still has competitors who'd likely have no problem reporting him to authorities if they were under pressure after a bust. since these elements of the story didn't ring true to me, I'm assuming that the meth part of the story isn't accurate either, though I don't enough to know whether it's accurate or not. so, because so many people liked it, and I thought the characters weren't authentic, i.e., the lawyer who is a criminal without an antenna and an experienced officer having no clue who the major meth producer is in his own town (not only that, but assuming officers would share that information amongst themselves, it meant that none of the officers knew who the top meth producer was - totally unbelievable), I didn't think the two shows I saw were all that. maybe I just picked one of the weaker disks. acting outstanding though. two and a half stars.",1385596800,,4823,4.64947245017585

4917177,5,B0060MYL3E,"Breaking Bad begins winding down by cranking things up to new extremes.  In these eight episodes, all storylines begin sprinting for the finish line, with some unfortunately dropping out of the race early.  Walt attempts to rebuild a viable business after killing off Gus in Season 4, but soon finds that to be a task easier said than done.  In the process, he recruits a quiet, unassuming young sociopath named Todd and begins cooking in people's houses under the guise of his latest cover-up venture, Vamonos Pest.  Skylar grows increasing distant and combative, Hank draws nearer to the truth, and Mike, hounded relentlessly by the DEA, attempt to exit the business.  Jesse, continually disillusioned by the extreme violence around him, also makes a move to get out.  Just like the first four seasons, these episodes are intense, shocking, and unpredictable.  You can tell that the trainwreck of Walt's life is speeding toward an inevitable deadly crash, but it's impossible to look away, to turn away from the impact and miss all the carnage.  It's too bad Breaking Bad couldn't have been a show that was able to stretch out to about eight seasons, but since it's perfect as is, you could also argue that more would have dampened its palpable urgency.  This truncated season is yet another high point of a legendary series.",1385510400,,1327,4.914798206278027

4917189,5,B0060MYL3E,I wanted to give this 4 stars because of how much down the rabbit hole the characters go and how violently evil things get. But I thought about how true to life this is when people loose themselves to their own divisive moralities and self justification of what they do when they lack Godly foundations.

When I picked up the box by one end at our gate outside the house (I was not home to receive the parcel in person) the DVDs slid to the other end of the package and nearly came spilling out on the ground. I'm not sure if the delivery person noticed this but I can't believe this is how poorly your DVD parcels are now secured before shipping.

Blue Ray player.  Many of us cannot afford to start over with all Blue Ray discs, and to expect so it ridiculous.

Now that it's out on DVD & Blu-Ray, I decided I wanted to watch the commentaries. So I rented the first disc (Blu-Ray format), instead of purchasing the set, not wanting to feel like I had paid for the season twice. I can't believe all the commentaries and extras! You feel like you get to know Vince Gilligan, which is  fun. It's going to take a really long time to watch it all. I may just have to buy the set in lieu of renting, haven't decided yet. Definitely want Blu-Ray to get a better viewing experience, including the nicely formatted English subtitles that I enjoy, for clarity.

Doesn't that say something when someone would buy the set on disc, after paying for the season on streaming? And doing so ""only"" for the bonus materials! (will definitely check out the ""used"" offerings).

The reason for the 1 star rating is that this set is supposed to contain the fifth season, but it contains only the first 8 episodes of the fifth season, the rest is NOT included. This fact is nowhere to be found in the description on amazon.
So I find myself with a set of half of the season for the full price of a season. In order to buy the rest I will have to buy the full season set once it comes out which makes this set useless to me.",1381363200,15,625,3.9682539682539684

It was simply fantastic and obviously well deserving of an Emmy or two or three for four or whatever they end up getting for Season 5 and 6. Just blew me away. Awesome after I watched Seasons 1 to 4 which I was totally thrilled watching. I didn't think that the next seasons would be as good but they were.

I was a Lost FANATIC....But even Lost began to fall apart a bit in the last season.  Dexter's final season was also contrived.  Breaking Bad was the equivalent of watching a 45 hour movie which, after season 1, moved at a frenetic pace that cannot be rivaled.

If you want to wait until the complete series box set, then go ahead, but regardless of this only being 8 episodes, they are 8 of the most important episodes in TV history.  They come after the best episode in the history of Television, and it might have been easy for a lesser show to buckle under that kind of pressure, though I would argue that none of these episodes quite reach that height, as a season it is by far the best ever.  Every episode is swinging for the fences haymaker of emotion.  This is the evil walt that is finally bad, struggling with the parts of himself that got him into this mess to begin with.

Kind of an anti-hero he was, not really a genuine good dude, but someone too root for, and since he is the main character that comes with the territory. One thing I noticed in the series whenever someone dies or their death is some how related too Walts actions he takes on certain traits and characteristics of that individual, well I won't spoil anything but at this point in the series he has taken on some of the worse and dark and gloomy characteristics, thats for sure 0_o And he has almost gone from being this interesting anti-hero sort of good bad guy, to this egotistical, self-obsorbed lossed individual who feels most problems can be fixed by just throwing money at it!

Maybe the studio intended that to be the end of season 5 and that the final episodes of the series would be considered season 6.

4917653,1,B0060MYL3E,"Just ran across this little piece of information about my old favorite Perry Mason. One reviewer on breaking bad said all the old shows are filled with filler and Breaking Bad has no filler. I kind of think the Fly episode was filler, but everyone to their own.

Here is what Perry Mason seasons looked like:

CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released all nine seasons of the 1957-66 Raymond Burr edition of Perry Mason on DVD in Region 1. Each season has been released in two-volume half-season sets because each season of Perry Mason contains considerably more material than a modern TV series. The first season of Perry Mason featured 39 episodes, Season 3 had 26 episodes, and all other seasons had either 28 or 30 episodes; this compares with 22 for a typical modern series. In addition, Perry Mason episodes are 50 to 53 minutes long, as opposed to a typical running time of 43 minutes for a modern 1-hour TV show release. Season 9, Volume 1 was released on June 11, 2013.[19] Season 9, Volume 2 was released on August 13, 2013.[20]

39 episodes in one season? now we have 8 new shows a year. Perry Mason had 271 episodes and 30 made for TV movies.

Think of what Breaking Bad could have been. It looks like it is ending on a whimper, not a bang. Two shows left, we will see.",1379721600,,1287,4.463829787234043

4917657,4,B0060MYL3E,"Good story lines, lots of drama.  This series holds you attention. I've not yet watched the final epesode....will the brother in law, Hank finally figure it out and bust Walt?",1379635200,,175,4.833333333333333
4917658,5,B0060MYL3E,"Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:

l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, ""Sure, Mom!"" like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and more. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.

2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believeable.

3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house--case over.

4. At Tio's when Tuko throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over. Law enforcement searches at least one mile radius of a crime scene--inch by inch.

5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.

6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy person on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers.

7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.

8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.

9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believeable.

10. When Hank was driving by the laundry, he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night.

11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.

12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him, logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.

13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.

14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.

15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.

16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant.

17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. The magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.

18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there would be enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.

19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed.

20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.

21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.

22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.

23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.

24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.

25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.

26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.

27. Ted would not be all goo goo over a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.

28. Once Skylar found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.

29. They can pay $800,000 cash for a car wash with no questions asked????? How is that money laundering????

30. Walt would have been traveling to the Caymen islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.

31. Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.

32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.

33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.

34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skylar. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, ""Diamonds, that will shut her up.""

35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat? In New Mexicto with heat in the 100's to 110's?

36. Skylar would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.

37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him. Why was his family never shown as interested in his disappearance. Too many people disappear with no one seeming to care. Not realistic.

38. The police are portrayed as bunbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believeable that no police officer can put two and two together.

39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Jr. No one gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. case closed

40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have in order to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.

41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.

42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. Pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.

43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.

44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle and he does not smell. Not believeable.

45. Hospitals film all visitors. Hank would have reviewed the tapes to see who was visiting Jesse. case closed

46. All in all, too many things just are not believeable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.",1379548800,,8167,4.291205211726385

It is simply must-see TV for the modern era; an era that doesn't necessarily involve a TV at all. In short, it's the best drama series of the past 5 years.",1379203200,,470,4.413793103448276

When you appreciate what a wonderful guy he is in real life - that makes his dark personality in Breaking Bad that much more rewarding.

4917827,5,B0060MYL3E,"Most TV series usually hit a speed bump by their fifth season as creative exhaustion begins to set in, but not BREAKING BAD; after a spectacular 4th season that culminated with the final (and literal) face off with Gus Fring, Vince Gilligan and company upped the ante and took the story of Walter White to heights heretofore unseen by their own, or any other show's, standards.

In season five, chemistry teacher turned meth cook, Walter White has finally reached the top of his chosen profession.  And with his partners, Jesse and Mike, Walter now plans to make millions free from the fear of drug lords like the now deceased Gus and Tuco.  But Walter learns, as everyone does, that being the boss is a lot harder job than it looks, for there are constant crises to resolve among partners, suppliers, former associates, family and the law in the person of his brother in law, Hank, a DEA agent now in charge of the Albuquerque office.  Dogged Hank is trying to tie up the loose ends from the Gus Fring investigation and keeps edging closer to learning Walter's secret.

No matter, Walter is a man who thrives on challenge and for every problem or setback, there is a solution, even if it means coming up with a scheme to drain a tank car on a train of desperately needed methylamine or orchestrate the mass murder of a bunch of potential snitches in lockup.  Is there anything left to salvage in this man's soul?  Faithful viewers will be pondering this question as each episode of season 5 leaves ever more mayhem, both physical and emotional, in its wake.  The episode titled ""Dead Freight"" contains a heist sequence worthy of Hitchcock, but ends on an act so heinous and despicable that even die hard fans will be shocked.

Bryan Cranston's acting has made Walter White a true contender for the greatest character in TV history, right along side Archie Bunker, Lucy Ricardo, and Tony Soprano.  To me his standout scene has to be when he explains why he does not want to take the buyout offer Mike has arranged and we learn something vital as to what makes this character tick.  All due praise should be given to Aaron Paul's Jesse, whose conscience is starting to wear down to the raw by his long partnership with Walt.  Then there is Dean Norris as Hank, who is far from the buffoon we first thought he was back in season 1; instead he has become  the only moral adult in sight.  Bob Odenkirk is back as Saul Goodman, perhaps the most corrupt lawyer in TV history.  And we really wonder what will happen when and if RJ Mitte's Walt Jr. learns the truth about his parents.

Special praise to Anna Gunn as Skylar, whose character seems to be barely holding it together as she runs the car wash and launders the drug money her husband wheels in.  Many viewers hate Gunn's character and the writer's do her no favor, but watching Gunn's acting as Skylar burns from the inside is a real treat.

But the breakout performance in season 5 is Jonathan Banks's Mike Eharmentraut, Gus Fring's former security chief and now Walt's wary (to say the least) partner.  With his deadpan delivery and steely glare, Mike is not to be messed with and his sparring with Walt is the highlight of the season.  Banks has been around a long time (I remember him on WISEGUY many years ago)and this was the role of a lifetime, making us actually feel sorry for this ruthless thug when things get tight.

There are a couple of new characters in Jesse Plemons's Todd and Laura Fraser's Lydia, the ultimate corporate weasel.  Larry Hankins makes a brief return as Old Joe, the junkyard owner who once again helps Walt and company out of a jam.

I'll never be able to hear ""Chrystal Blue Persuasion"" by Tommy James and the Shondells again and not think of BREAKING BAD. One of the best uses of an oldie ever.

How will it all end?  We are given a clue in the season opener's first scene and it does not look good; especially after the twist in the final scene of ""Gliding Over All,"" the season's climax, which sets up a showdown that has been in the making since the first show.  But no one should underestimate Walter White, many have and many have died.",1378166400,,4129,4.53099730458221

4917863,5,B0060MYL3E,"Breaking Bad is my favorite show on TV, and I think Season 5 (Part 1) is the best set of episodes yet.

The writing on this show is sharp.  The first episode, ""Live Free or Die"", gives us a flash-forward look at where Walt is one his 52nd birthday (its an intriguing scene that sets up where the series is heading).  The first few episodes deal with the aftermath of the events of Season 4, and then the show quickly moves into new territory.  With his lab destroyed, Walt must find a new place to cook.  He must also find new suppliers and new distribution for his product.  Walt's solutions to all of these problems are genius, and that's a testament to the genius of the writing staff on the show.

I think that two characters in particular really add to the greatness of this season: Mike, who is given more screen time a has a more important role in the story; and Lydia, an interesting new character who is played to perfection.

In addition to the writing/acting, the show has really excelled in its camera work.  The production uses the vast desert landscapes of New Mexico to their advantage and are able to shoot wider than any other TV show I've seen.  The directors and cinematographer Michael Slovis also aren't afraid to put the camera in unique places that give the viewer a very unique perspective.  The narrative this season also allows for a number of great montages, many of which feature the aforementioned point-of-view shots as well as some stunning time-lapse photography.

In terms of the blu-ray, picture and audio quality is fantastic.  There is also an audio commentary for every single episode.  Another great addition is ""Inside Breaking Bad""; a short 3-5 minute feature for each episode - it's a nice way to recap the events of that given episode, while also hearing from the show's writers/actors.

Please Note: This Blu-Ray set includes only the first half (8 episodes) of the Fifth Season... if you want the final episodes, then you'll need to purchase this too:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-Bad-The-Final-Season-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy-Blu-ray/dp/B00EEDNM2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking Bad: The Final Season (+UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray</a>]

Does it make the world a better place? Maybe not. But it does show a kind of example of the ""butterfly effect,"" and that can be employed to either good or evil.

It looks at our deep inner fears, at what we'll do to survive, and especially how the means to the end is the end.  Facing death, how far would you go for your family?  Pulled into the grip of greed, could you stop it?  What are the forces that drive us, good and bad?  The reason that this show is so addictive is that it grabs these questions by the roots and does not let go.  It grabs US by the roots, and if you can escape its grip, I would question whether you are human- or, perhaps you're a Buddhist Monk or a transcended guru.

The following series I finished watching over a weekend :

Walking Dead
American Horror Story
House of Cards (I am not a big fan of David Fincher.  To me, the guy's films are sleazy and lack a total sense of class. Despite that, I appreciated this one).

Some are not that not addictive that I never miss a season and entertaining and worth good quality writing and acting:

House
Modern Family
The Good Wife
Newsroom

And to a lesser level :

Suits
Person of Interest

But, I purchase Mad Men and Breaking Bad every season and never finish watching them (they end up in Ebay or in a trash can) :

Given how fantastic it is, why resort to a cheap trick, that is, selling half of the 5th season for full season price, for all appearances the real deal - but it isn't.  It is only half of the season, although it isn't labeled as such.

Could it be that even Vince Gilligan and Mark Johnson are Breaking Bad too, and charging double by tricking their followers.  Wouldn't it be classier to be upfront about it and just sell the whole season for a higher price?  Probably wiser to hold off on buying.

Now, 5 Seasons later, the acting is better than in the beginning.  Instead of getting boring, the characters keep you on your toes.

In addition to Dexter on Showtime, this is one of the best TV shows ever, in my humble opinion.  Bryan Cranston is stunning as Walter White.  I remember him from Malcolm in the Middle from years ago.  That show didn't do him justice;he is simply amazing!

4918259,1,B0060MYL3E,"Pretty serious accusation, right? Well you tell me if I'm wrong here.
A few weeks back, I'm searching for a way to get 'caught up' on Breaking Bad Season 5 (the first half that aired last year), so I'll be ready come August 11th 2013 when Season 5b premiers.

Amazon matched my search, so I checked it out, and it looked as though one could order 5a 'a la carte' ie; per episode for a few dollars per, and that THE FIRST EPISODE OF SEASON 5 WAS FREE !!! - I wish I'd taken a screen shot, because that's what the advertisement promised.

Well being that my checking account was below zero, free was the right price for me. I can always catch the rest after payday.

So that night I cozy up with my favorite beer on the recliner, and proceed to navigate through the Nintendo Wii console one of my kids left here. I did pretty well for a child of the 60's. So, okay, here it is, Breaking Bad Season 5 first episode. I 'click' on it, and begin to watch. After about 3 minutes I realize this EPISODE is NOT AN EPISODE at all!!!

It was a ""RECAP"" of the previous season. You know Gus getting blown up, and the whole Terminator dance out of the nursing home room. Etc.

So that my friends is why I give Breaking Bad Season 5, ONE STAR. - Amazon's version anyway.

Don't worry, I called Dish Network and had to order some package with channels I'll never watch, but at least my DVR is recording Season 5a as well as the 1st episode of Season 5b which follows at 9pm eastern.

- Sorry Amazon, but that was ""dirty pool"" as me mum used to say.

PS - If that wasn't enough, somehow in all my clicking around to order the fake Breaking Bad Season 5, I must've accidentally clicked the Amazon logo in the upper left corner of the screen  - [Look Now!] - to return to the home page, but they've sneakily put in a ""TRY PRIME"" link, embedded within the main link to their home page.

Unbeknownst to me, I'd also signed up to ""TRY"" Amazon Prime. - I had no idea. - Though I did get emails stating ""Look at all you can do with your Amazon Prime Account"" - and checked my Amazon account to see if I'd ordered anything like that, and it didn't show that I did. (but I really had been signed up). - So all during July I could have watched all the videos I wanted on here, with the only caveat being if I didn't want to keep it, just cancel before the 30 day period, otherwise I'd get billed the monthly charge.

Well I get my bank statement, and there it is! $79.00 for Amazon Prime!

Now I have to plan my day around calling Amazon, and explaining how I didn't order this PRIME thing, and frankly for $79.00 my Dish Network bill looks relatively inexpensive.

Oh of course then there's the overdraft fees on my checking account, but I think you get the picture.

I don't know who's paying $79 a month for streaming video, but I guess even in a depression of an economy such as this one, there's always going to be rich people.

God Bless them and their good fortune. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.

The show wasn't even recommended to me--a friend just mentioned ""I'm still getting caught up on Breaking Bad""  I was just curious---and so I started watching episodes on Netflix. It ended up that I'd literally find times that I could hide away from the rest of the family so I could catch up on all the seasons before Season 5 (b) started August 11...which I am happy to say I'm caught up! lol  The acting is outstanding--and the writers are amazing. I have been on the edge of my seat so many times just sick to my stomach with how intense it gets!  Aaron Paul is my favorite--but Dean Norris really needs to win an award here--he gives incredible performances each episode and should be recognized.

4918406,5,B0060MYL3E,The acting and writing in this show has made it so addicting to watch. The proper ingredients of chemistry between the actors mixed in with life's unpredictable scenarios makes the viewer feel the need to watch in judgement but cringe in guilt and shame as we see ourselves in the characters as they stumble through the moral web of justification of their decisions.,1375574400,,366,4.825396825396825

4918420,5,B0060MYL3E,"This Series is really a  superb psychological drama.  It started throughout Season 1 and 2 by developing the characters of Walter, Skylar, and Jesse.  At first you think that Walter is the good guy, and that Jesse will be the bad guy.  But as the Seasons have progressed it is quite the opposite.  Walter has developed into such a narcissistic character that he is beyond any hope as we proceed into the final episodes of Season 6.  Hank and his wife, the Chicken Man, Mike, the Lawyer, Ted, etc. all have been extremely interesting characters.  Each has flaws as do all people, but Walter has emerged as being the king of flaws.  He is so egotistical that he is constantly putting his family (the very people that he supposedly was doing all he does to provide for their future) into gave danger.  And because of his incredible ego he is in constant denial about the danger.  Only Jesse is the sane one.  It will be interesting to find out what the writers have done with Season 6 now that it looks like Hank is going to finally figure out that it is his brother-in-law who not only is the famous ""Cook"" of the blue meth but also a heartless murderer.",1375488000,,1152,4.438095238095238

4918452,5,B0060MYL3E,"This is a first-rate show especially for television. I never started watching it because I'm not really an AMC fan ever since they went with commercials. But I was going throught netflix one day under ""series tv"" and I noticed that they had 46 episodes availalbe to watch. Because I had heard so much about this show I deceided to give it a try. Guess what? I got hooked from the very first show! There were nights that I would watch back to back to back episodes and before long it was very late at night and I had to get some sleep because I had to work the next day! I finished the 46 episodes in a matter of time and because I was so involved with it, I needed to check out Season 5 because I knew Season 6 was coming up in August. So I bought the 5th Season through Amzaon Instant Net and got my fullfillment. So now I am caught up with all the episodes and can't wait until the premiere coming up in August. If you have never watched this show, I urge you to check it out. I'm sure you will be totally hooked. And because I do live in Albuquerque where the show is filmed, what  a pleasure it was to view all the areas and scenes that were filmed around our city. I recognized just about everything. And this past Season 5 is no different from the previous episodes. It just grabs you and will not let you go even if you have to turn in and get some sleep!! And  what a cliffhanger that they left at the end of Season 5! Don't overlook this show.",1375401600,,1452,4.073426573426573

4918468,5,B0060MYL3E,"Ok, I don't do drugs, never have, never will. But watching Walt make decisions, out of a warped sense of loyalty to his family which is really just a farce for his thirst for power, is fascinating and leaves me ""jonesing"" for the next episode. The hardest part about watching the second part of Season 5 is having to wait week after week for the next episode.

4918469,5,B0060MYL3E,"What can I say about seson five that hasn't already been said about one through four.  It's a nobrainer to watch if you caught
the first four seasons.  Season six starts next Sunday night free on TV so you've got time to catch up.  Actually I rather like
renting the videos because i don't have to mess with commercials and it's cheap enough as to be worthwhile as well as I can
watch it when I want, not when AMC wants.  Season six will be the last and I think it's time for this tale to end, but man, oh, man,
what a dark crazy sinful ride and while I have no idea how it ends my guess is the both end up with about the same amount of $$
as they started with in season one, but knowing these writers, hell, the whole dang gang might get wasted.",1375315200,,746,3.9865771812080535

It's also been interesting to see how the pendulem has swing towards him being a more heartless and crazed person. I don't see this ending well for him.,1375228800,,358,4.4393939393939394

4918510,1,B0060MYL3E,"This Show is without a doubt, the best show that I've ever watched. The episodes in this season are no different. The fact that you are reading this review lead me to believe that you feel the same way about the series. That being said, I was very disappointed when I got this Blu-ray in the mail.

I purchased this item almost a year ago on pre-order with the impression that I would get the full season once the show completed its run (There is no indication on the item description that would indicate otherwise). Instead I got the first 8 episodes a few months prior to the airing of the final 8 episodes. I feel incredibly disappointed that I only got half of what was advertized. I won't tell you not to buy this item, the content is great, I just need to make it clear exactly what you're getting before you spend your money on it like I did.

I would like to contact Amazon to inquire if they will be shipping the second half of the season when it becomes available to those who already bought this item, or maybe even issue a significant discount to those who have already ordered this item because based on all the negative reviews, I'm not the only one who felt that they were lied to.

If you are clicking on an adult themed drama, such as Breaking Bad, you know what that you can expect a few curse words (and maybe more).

I had to play some catch-up since I came to it a just about a year ago. Wow. Great story with twists and turns. Great characters who cross back and forth from noble to evil. Wonderful cinematography. Suffused with violence but very little of it comes off as gratuitous. Pretty much the whole bag.

I can't wait for the final episodes. It figures to be quite a doozy.

Well done, AMC!",1374796800,,525,4.188118811881188
4918621,5,B0060MYL3E,"We see Walt White start to walk down a dark path in the previous season.  Making sacrifices wherever, and how ever needed.  In season 5 part 1, it becomes more apparent.

With Gus gone, Mike Ehrmantraut explores new options.  More people involved than expected.  Jessie in limbo on the business.  With Walt's personal relationship(s) on the rocks, along with new tasks at hand, He has to do what he can to stay afloat, & avoid his Brother in Law every step of the way.

The series gets better & better every season.  Season 5 part 1 is this example.  The writing is superb.  The adventures Walt & Jessie experience are never dull.  This series has been a great ride.  I'm looking forward to part 2 of season 5 to see how it all ends.

The only complaint of this series is only the Blu Ray.  It's 8 episodes. I don't know why disc 1 has all 8 episodes listed in the menu options, but the disc says 1-4.  When clicking on 5-8, it tells you to insert disc 2.  Pointless...  Don't know why they did this, but it's a very small gripe.  This season still gets a 5/5.

It is easily the best scripted program being aired right now, and this season just underscores its greatness. The true test for every great series is if it can pull off an ending that lives up to the quality of the previous 5 seasons. We have seen most fail at this challenge, but as for Breaking Bad, I have a feeling Gilligan will succeed at bringing a worthwhile ending to this superlative series. It will be sorely missed. And August 11 can not get here soon enough.

I found it hard to watch Walter devolve into such a monster. Killing a child? Really? How low can he go?

Admittedly I think my oppinion is partially affected by the deterioration of Heisenberg's morals. It was cool to watch in Season 4, but now it's just hard to watch how terrible a person he has become and to witness how strained his marriage has become.  Honestly, I don't quite understand why his wife is so depressed all of a sudden. She seemed to be okay with her situation last season. What has changed? I'm still interested to see what transpires in it's final season. I hope it's the best season yet.",1374710400,7,795,4.445205479452055

4918685,5,B0060MYL3E,"Breaking Bad is a truly great show, but it's also an undeniably terrible thing to witness...and I think witness is the right word, because it's really like watching a train wreck. Season 5 continues the evolution of the BB story arc, and because I don't want to give any spoilers, I'll just say you're probably going to hate a lot of what you see. That's not to say the show is falling apart, because it's probably as great as it ever was, but I have to admit that by about mid-way through Season 5 I was anxiously looking forward to completing the season, just to get a break from this story I could not let go of. The fact that the characters and story are this engrossing is a testament to the rarified accomplishment that is BB.

Waited the whole year to see the final season only to get 8 episodes, and have to wait a whole other year to see the rest. Then they put this out and charge what they would for a full season? I'm going to buy it, but either when they put the full season together in one package, or when some retailers on Amazon start selling it for like $10. Half a season is not worth a full seasons price... Sorry it just isn't. And don't come back at me talking about how great the show is. I agree... I love it.

I wondered (as a huge fan of Dexter, Mad Men, Homeland, and other great shows) -- why Breaking Bad was winning so many awards. After watching all of the episodes this summer -- most shows pale in comparison (except Homeland) -- even though the other shows are OUTSTANDING series with fantastic actors. The only new series to come out that may be even slightly close to as good -- is Bates Hotel. So all of us -- when we get withdrawal from Breaking Bad being over -- can still watch Bates Hotel and Homeland! Dexter will also be over, and Mad Men is on it's way. I just hope shows up to the extreme caliber of writing and acting -- that is in Breaking Bad -- will be on our home screens in the future.

The show is very gritty and not for the faint of heart. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of The Sopranos (because it has multiple antiheros) or the Walking Dead (because it is pretty intense and violent at times)

My one critique of the show, which is not detrimental enough to even cost one of the five stars but still an annoyance, is the sound editing. The music is way too loud at certain points and the dialogue is way too quiet. I often find myself turning up the volume for an intense, emotionally charged whisper scene, and then WHAMMY!

You cannot second guess the outcome as the twists and turns are so brilliantly done.  Season 5 has left us hanging.  As we all know the next season or the other half of this season whichever way you want to look at it is the last.  It can end in so many different ways.  I hate to wish my life away but roll on August 11th when the season final starts.  It is a shame we will have to wait a year to get the last season on DVD to complete my series.  I could say so much more but don't want to give anything away and spoil your enjoyment.  As usual, the DVD's are worth the money, the show is worth the money, and the actors, writers, directors etc. all deserve their awards.  And, even though Jessie has done some terrible things, I just want to pick him up and hug him and tell him it will be okay.

The next season is a continuation of Season 5, and it is my understanding that it will be the final series of episodes.

Watching episodes is genuinely entertaining and doesn't feel like a chore like some other shows. The only critique I have is Skyler's character...It's annoying and at times unwatchable..there have been times where I just skip over complete dialogues between Walt and her because I can't deal with it. Seasons 4 and 5 have been amazing and this is one of the few shows that just keeps getting better and better each season. I actually care about the characters.

4919183,5,B0060MYL3E,"The ""Fifth Season"" is little misleading if you did not watch this great TV series on AMC because the package only contains the FIRST half of the FIFTH and FINAL season.  The story and acting are great as usual, they always have a ""W T F"" moment.  The beginning teaser is the weakest one out of all the season IMO.  (The pink teddy bear is still number one on my list.)  It felt a little weird as I no longer root for Mr. White...  Instead of the joy of him outsmarting everybody, I now have only distaste.  All the previous seasons there were a justification for his actions (Tuco, the Twins, then Gus) but this time... he is the KING.  He is the new Gus.

4919287,5,B0060MYL3E,"Bought this first portion of season 5 so my girlfriend could be ready for the final season. In my opinion, $20 for the 8 episodes in HD is well worth it. Just compare it to going to a movie for two and that alone justifies the expense. The quality of the video is great. Sometimes it doesn't look as crystal clear as one would wish but that has more to do with the Internet connection than the product. The show itself has been an instant classic in my eyes. Seasons 1-4 have all been amazing and season 5 does not disappoint. Now we are all caught up and ready for the conclusion to this epic series.

Season five shows the continued escalation of Walt and Jesse's underground career and the fallout from Fring's elimination.  Some of the shockers were very hard for me to swallow (and I'm an experienced and rather jaded fiction writer, myself).  I found myself wishing the show hadn't gone in particular directions, but after reflection realized their writers were being true to the harsh realities of the drug trade, organized crime, and keeping the plot dynamics away from cliches.  To do any less would cheapen the show and glamorize the illegal meth business.

NOTE: This is eight episodes, and apparently not the whole season.  Still a good value.  Still, the momentum of the show by the end of episode eight indicates that a sparkly, happy ending is not ahead, that there's plenty more to go wrong, and that the show could continue into increasingly darker territory, shattering the boundaries that have already been penetrated.  Some viewers may experience lingering stress and anxiety from these eight episodes, not to mention the ones yet to come, should they choose to proceed.

As with the previous seasons, the characters are well-played, the cinematography is masterful, and the show is clearly a history-maker in the antihero genre.",1373155200,2,1315,5.079069767441861

Watching one episode and waiting a full week is tough stuff now!
I purchased the 1st year of breaking bad and never watched it because I am not a fan of drug glorification now that I have children. I watched a bit of the 4th season while getting my oil changed and realized, while the mechanic worked, that his was not about glorification at all and was hooked from that day on. Started watching the series I had bought soon after that.  You love Walter, you hate Jesse.  You hate Walter, you love Jesse. In the end (thus far) you realize that they would have all been happier and left a better legacy for themselves with those they love if they had continued their merger boring existence instead of choosing this path.

There are some flaws and there was nit picking over the last scene of the season but I do not care cause it was so damn entertaining. There are scenes that will leave your jaw on the floor. The season has no bad guy, it is just Walt creating a meth empire (becoming scarface) and cutting loose ends from Gus's empire. His actions affect every one around him. The show ends on a cliff hanger and keeps you wanting more. Cranston, Paul, and Odenirk, Anna Gunn all give emmy worthy performances as usual.

4919475,5,B0060MYL3E,"I see numerous one star reviews complaining about getting ripped off for ""half a season"" and AMC ""Double Dipping""

Both points are WRONG!

This is the COMPLETE season 5!

Season six will premiere in August of 2013. Both SEASONS will be eight episodes each. This was done at the request of Vince Gilligan. When negotiating to continue after season four he requested to do 16 more episodes and AMC agreed. AMC was fine with airing the 16 as two separate parts of one, fifth season. However, Gilligan insisted that they treat each eight as separate seasons. This was done to ensure pay raises for his cast and crew. Pay raises that are automatic as part of the production contracts. Every new season the cast and crew get bumps. If AMC was allowed to air the 16 episodes as two parts of a fifth season these raises would not happen.

Breaking Bad will be six official seasons when it's done. One of seven episodes, three of 13 and two of eight. Six total and unique seasons.

This is definitely a great purchase for any fan of the show. The commentary tracks are hilarious and filled with interesting behind the scenes tidbits. The writers, cast, and crew all sound like genuinely fun people who love what they're doing and strive for the best thing they can possibly present to the audience.

Aside from the commentary, the other bonus features are interesting as well. They really focus on the writing and have several featurettes about how they go about writing an episode. There's really tons of bonus material here. They've managed to include a lot on Blu-Ray containing 8 episodes.

My average cost for Seasons 1-4 was $17.35 each. Yet I like this show so much that I paid almost double that when Season 5 came out. Then I found out that it has only 8 episodes! Someone is getting greedy. Not to mention, that over the 8 episodes, the show (although still excellent) seemed to lose something from the previous seasons. Not sure what. Maybe my expectations are too high.
I, too, assumed I was getting *ALL* of Season 5, especially considering the price. I'm glad to hear there is more, but not happy about being gouged.

Update November 17 2013:
Glad to see the price for the final episodes drop a little ($34.99) until I realize that FREE Shipping kicks in at $35.00 now. I've noticed many of Amazon's prices add up to just under the FREE Shipping threshold. Many times I have added to my order to get FREE Shipping but often I can't find something I want for the few dollars needed to exceed the $35.00 threshold.

Bottom line, *ALL* of Season 5 will end up costing me about $65.",1371772800,3,1011,4.401069518716578

I have Turbo speed which I upgraded to with Time Warner  in hopes That I would receive better reception. No success. Now I understand why you charge more for HD rentals. I would judge that most of your offerings on prime are B grade movies and mostly old and out of date. Everything in both prime and extra streaming of new movies should all be in HD
Your cost of renting an HD movie or series, especially the extra cost if you want it in HD is way too high. Your charging of extra fees to view older movies and not having them available on prime at the monthly cost of prime is selling your customers an old and worn out product.  See no difference between your service, Netflix and the others. I was hoping for a better grade product that lives up to the Amazon name.",1371686400,,881,4.201183431952662

When you couple that character development and evolution with great and witty writing ,editing, cinematography and all the other ingredients, it makes for an all timer.

4919830,1,B0060MYL3E,"I bought all of the Seasons on DVD and am now watching The Fifth Season (apparently only half of the episodes are on the Fifth Season DVD I just learned from reading other reviews).  I love the show, the acting is great, it is filmed beautifully.  My only complaint?  There are no subtitles in English.  What the ****?  You can turn on subtitles in numerous world languages, but not English!?  This is a gross oversight on the production of the DVDs.  Sometimes the dialogue is hard to understand, eg., Hank talking through a respirator while investigating the blown-up lab.  And Walt sometimes almost whispers.  With Marie you sometimes have to turn the volume down because she can be very shrill and talks so fast.  Hanks partner sometimes mumbles.  It would have been nice to have gotten all the dialogue from the Madrigal episode where the Chinese delegation meets with the DEA.

C'mon!  The sound engineers could do a better job of clarifying the dialogue especially when there is loud machinery, respirators, and music played OVER the dialogue.  Overpowering background audio seems to be a phenomenon going on in film and TV the last several years. Sound engineers and editors -- you can do better than this!  And what about the hearing impaired?  Without subtitles they can they watch the DVD?

Since there are so many twists and turns in the plot, missing one line can affect the next action, or even the next episode(s).  So if anyone knows the secret to turning on the subtitles in ENGLISH on the DVDs, please post it here!  (I have tried everything --  DVD player, TV, Amplifier, etc., to no avail).

Because of the sometimes lousy audio and no subtitles I've given it One Star.  I do love the show, but don't like it when I have to rewind 5 times to figure out what was said.  And in case you're wondering, i'm not hearing impaired.",1371254400,4,1844,4.658385093167702

 Is overpriced.  Is it the shows fault?  Nope, it's the studios.  Buy an Episode for $1.99 each, doesn't add up right?  But the Studios feel, that since the show is being Pirate, they jack the price up.  That's why I wait until a sale, or buy it used.  Just picked up seasons 1-4 for $9.99 each.

4919897,4,B0060MYL3E,"It's a great show, but the train robbery was a virtually unbelievable whopper of a caper.  I wasn't sure if I was watching The Wild, Wild West, Mission: Impossible or Breaking Bad.  There were far too many ways for it to go wrong for it to have come off successfully.  Admittedly Walter (Heisenberg) White had previously told some lying whoppers and got away (more or less) with them, but this was an actual physical undertaking with multiple imponderables, so to my mind, it was uncharacteristic of what Walter's capacity for risk would tolerate.

For example, there was a certainty of unfamiliarity of the train's hardware, but they turned out with all the right tools.  Not all tankers are identical, even for the same owner, car-builder or shipper.  The train could have stopped another car length or two in either direction to foil the plan.  The engineer or conductor could have emerged from the engine on either side.  if they'd come out of the other side, they could have seen what was going on.  There were a number of other incredible occurrences and no clear recommendation for burying tanks to receive the train's contents, nor reason to imagine that railroad inspectors wouldn't have come across them, or that a flash flood in the arroyo wouldn't have floated them out, leaving a lot of people looking into what had happened in the railroad right of way.

It isn't noted anywhere in the item description, and while I now see it's not labeled ""The Complete Fifth Season"" as the others had been, I didn't even realize you had the option to purchase parts of seasons on DVD.

The plot, lack of luster. It was just slow and not too exciting but of course I hope there is a new season. It was fun to see Mr. White turn into his alter ego, and I just love Jesse, and I loved to hate Mr. White's cheating, bitchy wife!

4920020,5,B0060MYL3E,"First let me say that Breaking Bad is simply the best TV drama ever. I can't say enough good things about it. And, yes, I am a big fan of The Wire, and on a given day might give that one the nod for different reasons. But no other show ever has embedded such moral complexity within an urgently explosive narrative. Walter White's character arc is meteoric; he turns weakness into strength and fails to realize the weakness of his own ambition. It's the closest we have to Greek tragedy, and at its best evokes what Joyce called ""the terrible emotions of pity and awe.""

All this is the more stunning when you realize that it's from AMC, the network that brings you bowdlerized versions of Pulp Fiction and The Big Lebowski (""This is what happens when you meet a stranger in the Alps!""). Realizing that AMC brought you Breaking Bad is like one day discovering that Lithuania has landed an exploration party on Mars and brought it back safe--and you didn't even know they had a space program!

Okay, let's talk about Season V now. In a way it's the calm before the storm, everything leading up to Season VI, which will be the final conflict and the resolution of the series. Naturally, this could have been just a waiting period, and we would have been okay with a lull. Walter White has just won a major victory (and lost his soul into the bargain), but now he's broke. How he gets back on top in ""the game""--and what that costs him--is what Season V is all about. There is plenty of action, but what is riveting is the growth of Walter's moral disaster and his hubris. He has become a god in his own mind and in the minds of many others. His inevitable fall in Season VI will be horrifying and riveting.

Already we see that Vince Gilligan, the show's creator and best writer, is giving us intimations that there is a big final confrontation to come: in the first episode of V we see Walt a year older and he is in a Denny's buying an M-60, for what reason we don't know. My immediate thought was: here comes the ""Say hello to my little friend!"" bloodbath. And then Gilligan underscores that by having Walt watching exactly that part of Scarface with Walt, Jr. Still, all this could still be misdirection on Gilligan's part. He's fooled me before when I thought I knew what was coming. That is one of the joys of Breaking Bad, in fact. It's so good and builds up such tension that you can't stop trying to figure out what will happen next. And even when you're 100% sure what *has* to happen, Gilligan makes something else happen that is not only different but surprising and better than you imagined it could be.

I can't recommend this show enough. My friends who haven't seen it I nag incessantly about how good it is and they tell me I'm overselling it--until they get hooked themselves. ""It's even better than you said,"" one of them confided. ""I thought no show could possible be as good as you were making this one out to be, but in retrospect everything you said now seems like understatement.""

4920051,5,B0060MYL3E,"The fifth season of ""Breaking Bad"" rolled out with a new King in town as Walt stepped up his game with Gus Fring. For those who haven't seen the fifth season, I don't want to spoil it beyond my opening sentence expect to say that Walt goes to deeper more dangerous places than ever before. Let's just say that Jesse and Mike form an uneasy partnership with Walt hoping to provide the best meth and keep the proceeds. There are ramifications for Walt pushing Gus from his pedestal. Best of all the first episode has a flash forward taking us towards the end of the series and setting up many questions that will be answered in July of this year with the final episodes of the show.

This is really the first half of the fifth season with AMC choosing to air the second half beginning next month so you only get eight episodes here rather than the usual 16 from seasons 2 and 3.

The image quality is exceptional here with a very nice transfer for the show and the detail is much richer than even the broadcast version.

The lossless audio sounds marvelous with nice activity in the surround speakers and plenty of detail and ambiance.

The special features are outstanding here; we get eight commentary tracks as well as. We also get uncensored versions of the episodes for ""Hazard Pay"", ""Buy Out"" and ""Say My Name"". There is also a newly produced scene for the episode ""Chicks and Guns"". We also get behind-the-scenes ""Chicks and Guns"" featurette. We also get deleted and extended scenes.

There's also a featurette that takes place in the writer's room narrated by the writers--it's a weird idea as it is shot timelapse over 12 days. Sony has also included the auditions for Jesse Plemons and Laura Fraser. There is also footage of the rehearsal for the prison stunt as well as ""Chris Hardwick's All Celebrity Bowling"". Finally there are 19 episodes of the ""behind the scenes"" moments focusing on key moments in the fifth season.

There is also a four page booklet that gives the titles of various episodes and special features on each disc. Unfortunately, the print for this booklet is pretty darn particularly for the credits of each episode. The final extra is the ability to stream this via Ultraviolet (no iTunes that I could see though for those who want to download the episodes and watch them while traveling, etc.).

Another outstanding season for ""Breaking Bad"" promising a spectacular, powerful solution.",1370390400,3,2416,4.710900473933649

4920055,4,B0060MYL3E,"I love this series, but I despise the half-season volumatic format, especially when the studio creates deceptive packaging that DOES NOT ADVERTISE THE FACT that the set is incomplete.

This is The Fifth Season ""Volume 1"" and NOT ""Thew Complete Fifth Season."" This is double dipping and I despise being double-dipped.

It comes with UV, but I have no idea whether the UV code unlocks the entire season (you get new episodes as they're released)or whether it's a UV code for ONLY the first 8 episodes of the season and you still have to re-purchase the entire last half of the season to get the rest on UV. If the latter is the case I'm gonna' be pretty pissed. I'm already pretty pissed about this.

Amazon should really do the right thing and title this or describe it to make it perfectly clear it's only a half-season set.

If you're a completist, you may want to wait for the ""COMPLETE Season 5."" Vote with your money. I feel I got suckered into this by deceptive packaging... I don't watch the show on TV, so I assumed that since they were releasing a set called ""The Fifth Season"" it was the COMPLETE Fifth Season. IT IS NOT, and moreover it's not made clear that it's not. Very annoying the studio would choose to release the show this way (no blatantly obvious indicator on the packaging that indicate it's NOT the complete season).
