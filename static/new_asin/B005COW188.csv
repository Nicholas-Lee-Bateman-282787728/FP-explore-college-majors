8465757,5,B005COW188,Wonderful film.  I am glad that Mr. Kissinger cooperated as much as he did.  Much more than I would have.  This is the best film on Kissinger.,1431648000,,142,4.185185185185185
8465758,5,B005COW188,"I have not been thinking lately about that period although I was around through the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon years. This DVD brought many memories back in a very real way. I have always admired Kissinger and have never understood those who hate him. He was the foremost diplomat of the world and leaders of all countries were well aware. I never thought that Kissinger put on a false front and that he always negotiated with the well being of our country as the foremost thought in his mind. I enjoyed this DVD and plan to revisit it from time to time in order to remind myself of real history. You either believe Kissinger or you don't and I cannot understand those who don't or those who have made up their minds to treat him as some sort of enemy of mankind. Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD and I think it accurately portrayed the man. It also puts a person in the position of real believable history with one of the real believable persons of history.",1358294400,3,959,4.423728813559322
8465759,4,B005COW188,Fascinating to see and hear the personal expressions of Dr. Henry Kissinger.  The historic footage was well chosen. It had touching moments of his life and some background of how he became the man he is. It was interesting to hear what his children went through. My favorite part was his account of Nixon's last night in the White House. It is a glimpse at history and an amazing life.,1346803200,5,385,4.5
8465760,1,B005COW188,One wonders if Kissinger had final cut on this romantic portrayal of the man. See The Trial of Henry Kissinger for the truth. This video should come with a disclaimer that it is a fictional account of how Kissinger would like to be perceived by history.,1333238400,3,253,4.521739130434782
