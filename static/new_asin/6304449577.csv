7872262,2,6304449577,"i bought this as a gift for my 9 and 12 year old daughters. The first time they ran through it we had a few good laughs at them trying to keep up. But, since then it has been a great dust collector. They have played it maybe 3 times in several months and no longer voice their urge to ""learn to dance"". I'm sure there are better ones out there than this video but it was okay for the price. If I could go back......I'd save my money.",1020988800,,433,3.8764044943820224
7872263,1,6304449577,"This tape should be off the market.  Period.  Even the title is misleading.  You learn nothing by watching this.  It would have been better for me to have spent the money on something else.  By the time I finished  the tape, I was so frustrated--at myself for having bought it without  having read any reviews and at MTV for putting out this garbage.  I would  have given it no star if I could have; giving it one star is actually very  generous.",959644800,13,446,4.329268292682927
7872264,1,6304449577,this is not a tape for you if you want to learn new dance moves.  it does not teach you nothing but flapping your arms like a dummy.  and the time it does teach you will be the last five minutes of the tape.  the rest is  talking.,945907200,28,230,3.7291666666666665
