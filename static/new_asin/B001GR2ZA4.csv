8306738,2,B001GR2ZA4,"Thought that this might be good given the fact that it gained 4 Awards. However, I was Wrong. It turned out to be a Dismal movie shot in the poor Russian countryside. All it seemed to be about were three men running around in the countryside with occasional Nazis showing up. It's done in Russian with English sub-titles. Don't waste your money. Find something else that's more Enjoyable.",1494460800,,388,4.720588235294118

8306740,3,B001GR2ZA4,"My wife is from Russia and loves this film.  I, on the other hand, was led to believe it was a war film.  Despite the five minutes at the beginning, it was totally different.  I have my issues with it but never living in an occupied country during war, I did not really understand the mentality of the people involved.  Decent film but a war movie it is not, nor is it a breakout of prison film either.  Just a movie about people doing anything they can to survive in a really messed up situation.",1422316800,,497,4.189473684210526

8306743,4,B001GR2ZA4,"Depicted well the psychological and the physical effects of warfare, paricularly for that place and time.
A thoughtful story of the diverse peoples of the former Soviet and how events affected their lives.",1357689600,,205,5.242424242424242
8306744,4,B001GR2ZA4,"This film throws together two die-hard Soviet officers and an enlisted infantryman as they hide from the Nazis and collaborting Russians behind enemy lines.  It takes a while to develop but you see how they are all more alike than different and the characters grow on you over time.  What gets to me is how the leader of the group, a practical and dyed-in-the-wool security officer, breaks down after his friend, a commissar, sacrificed himself so he and two others could get away.  The security officer earlier promptly kills a fellow soldier who was trying to exploit the commissar's Jewish heritage for personal gain.  It's only later that you realize the security officer was acting more to protect his friend, whom he really cares for, than out of brute, efficient, Stalist-era cruelty. The film shows the enduring humanity of people as they face extreme situations.  It also shows how primitive and earthy life was in rural Russia in the early 1940's.  Well worth viewing with its haunting musical score that speaks to the soul.",1357689600,3,1034,4.913793103448276
8306745,4,B001GR2ZA4,"This is a good film if you already like Russian modern cinema, but maybe not so good if you are unfamiliar with this genre. It is very earthy and depicts how crude life was in the USSR during ww2. It is basically about 3 escaped Red Army POW's who are trying to make their way back to the Soviet lines but get caught up in the local intrigues and politics of one of their father's home town, and the violence that ensues. Worth a look but the overall message is Russian Nationalism and screw the facts about the horrors of communism that cost so many of their lives. The Germans and their collaborators are the bad guys here and fall down like keystone cops when assaulted. The partisans and peasants win all the conflicts and all work together for Mother Russia. Yeah, right ! A one sided look at this era.
The cinematography and acting is good, as are the uniforms and overall historical look of the film, but I can do without the one sided political perspective. An interesting film but don't expect objectivity.",1350691200,9,1015,4.491891891891892
8306746,5,B001GR2ZA4,"The jacket notes were a little misleading in that the escape of our trio of heroes is not from a prisoner of war cage but rather from the endless column of prisoners on the way to incarceration in just such a cage.

But apart from that this is a great film set in Occupied Russia in 1941 a few weeks/months after the invasion by Germany. (The jacket notes indicate that one year has passed but to my mind the span of the film is perhaps 10 days, maybe 2 weeks, after Barbarossa.) There are very few clues to indicate the exact time in which it is set, few references are made to the Germans, a battle takes place which may have been part of Barbarossa but perhaps it is a much later battle. The collaborating Russians are already in office, but our trio of heroes age very little and are never seen to shave etc etc, but really that is immaterial to the underlying story.

Buy it for the opening battle scenes alone ----------- breathtaking in their realism. !!!!!!

Again an interesting and probably true to life depiction of 'dirt poor' peasant life in the Soviet Union of 1941.",1297468800,12,1080,4.417085427135678
8306747,5,B001GR2ZA4,"(1.) Of the over 200 U.S. & international movies of all genres I've seen in the past year this Russian historical presentation of Russian vs. Russian vs. German WW II semi-documented/factual conflict was amongst the best.
(2.) After seeing this movie if I were a U.S. taught actor or cinematographer I would be humbled. It was so captivating that there were moments when I felt I was privy to the actual historical film footage and real-world drama of that period.
(3.) I'm sold but viewers really should check out the many awards it received as testimony to it's greatness.",1234224000,15,574,4.808080808080808
