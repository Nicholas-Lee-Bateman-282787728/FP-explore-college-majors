Price, Steber, and the others are amazing singers with such a command of vocal technique  that each performance is a voice lesson in itself.  You can see how good  their posture is, how they form their vowels, how they convey a sense of  drama.  This is a treasure trove and a great resource for singers as well  as pure enjoyment for anyone who enjoys classical singing.
I'm not a  sentimental sap, but it is hard to listen to some of these arias without  misting up a bit.  These recorded performances are truly a tribute to the  human voice and what it can do.",960854400,5,696,4.325581395348837
