2439954,4,B000BT96PU,"The DVD is a late-1970s documentary of the popular game show hosted by Monty Hall - who was also co-producer and co-creator - that aired (the original series) in daily and nighttime syndication from 1963-1977.

It is a fantastic insider's look at the production of the program; every facet is covered, even the process of selecting contestants to appear in an episode. Hall and announcer Jay Stewart are prominently featured in interview segments, which makes this a combination of a fascinating trip into pop culture nostalgia and an excellent historical piece for those interested in or studying facets of the entertainment industry.

With ""The Lovely"" Carol Merrill - who modeled the various prizes - Hall had a winning formula for many years. Until the old episodes are packaged into DVD collections for release, this will be the best outlet to see what made the ""Big Deal of the Day"" a winner.",1230422400,3,898,4.940397350993377
2439955,4,B000BT96PU,"This was a classic 1978 documentary on a long running game show that ran in various versions for many years on network TV and syndication. ""Deal"" gives the viewer some rare behind-the-scenes moments on the making of ""Let's Make A Deal"" during an actual taping of a show.  It has interviews with host Monty Hall and original announcer, Jay Stewart. It also has a scene where contestants in costumes wait in line outside the ABC-TV studios in Los Angeles for their chance to be lucky enough to be selected to attend a taping of an episode of ""Let's Make A Deal"" and possibly be picked by Monty to make a deal with him. Contestants have options to take something like a sure cash prize or trade what is in the box or curtain on stage. Sometimes it's a more valuable prize or even a worthless 'zonk' prize. Later, two contestants have an opportunity to trade in everything for one of three doors for the 'Big Deal of the Night'. One of them was lucky to pick the right door. Then the 'Big Deal' winner is offered to risk one more time to have a chance to win an additional $20,000 in cash in the 'Super Deal' game. He or she would pick on of three mini-doors. One has the 20 Grand. If the contestant picks that, they win it plus they also keep their 'Big Deal' prize, but if they pick any of the other two, they lose their 'Big Deal', but still take that cash prize behind that door as a consolation. In this episode, the contestant just walks away with their 'Big Deal' prize and turns down the chance at the 'Super Deal'.
For a game show fan like me, I enjoyed this DVD a lot! Hopefully someday, an actual collection of episodes of ""Let's Make A Deal"" will be released on DVD in the future. Hey, it could happen! They did it with ""Match Game"" last year!",1192320000,13,1751,4.306060606060606
2439956,5,B000BT96PU,"An excellent look inside the program that truly defined the game show genre, including cast/crew interviews and a fascinating peek inside the taping of an actual episode, from the arrival of audience members to their families' reactions afterwards.

While this documentary has been available on VHS for a number of years, copies were not easy to find and many were of varying quality. However, this remastered edition looks/sounds great, and the addition of a LMaD trivia game's a nice touch, though they could've added more special features along those lines. But that said, it's still a great buy for any GS fan out there...check it out!",1146009600,5,639,5.028301886792453

8091961,4,B000BT96PU,"Utmost, there is no question that Hollywood lost a real giant. I was just so devastated to hear about the death of Monty Hall. He was a real blessing, not just as a game show host, but a activist to building hospitals across America & Canada. He really knew the art of deal better than Donald Trump had bragged, but also showed a real heart of kindness. When I do think of him, I think of all the game shows he had worked on: Video Village, Beat The Clock, Split Second, and overall his greatest work, Let's Make A Deal. The guy really had so much to celebrate in his life, career & what he and Stephan Hatos made out of a sleeping giant, into a juggernaut. Watching Deal, you really do get a idea of what made Let's Make A Deal into the sensation that it became, especially when it really ruled ABC at a time when they were not so strong with game shows, which Family Feud would take over as their longest-running game show. But watching the documentary, I know just how much heart Deal shows the real joy of winning & even more the pleasure of getting zonked.

Monty Hall, America just got zonked, & we will absolutely miss you. You really were a blessing on TV.
