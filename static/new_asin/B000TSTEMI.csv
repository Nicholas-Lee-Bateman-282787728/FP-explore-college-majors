2910058,4,B000TSTEMI,The product is great. But I was disappointed because I thought that I had order a different loony toons collection video. I still like it I just really had wanted a different one then the one I got!,1207008000,,198,4.2368421052631575
2910059,4,B000TSTEMI,"I have the first 4 golden collections. This time I thought I'd get the spotlight collection since the extra disks don't have much that I enjoy. From reading reviews, I was under the impression that the spotlight collection is just two disks straight out of the golden collections. But there is one big difference - the shorts on the spotlight disks don't have the optional commentary tracks to go with them, which I really do enjoy. So I'm trading mine in on the golden collection.",1202774400,11,481,4.670588235294118
2910060,5,B000TSTEMI,"A great value for the price!  For those who don't want to invest in the Gold Collection or can't afford it, this is a good purchase.  It contains plenty of toons on the two dvds, 30 in all, more than enough to keep a child or adult occupied for quite some time.  I loved Ali Baba Bunny, The Abominable Snow Rabbit, Bewitched Bunny, Holiday for Shoestrings.  It was great to watch them all again, and I look forward to watching them over and over.  The only thing I miss is the intro song to the t.v. show, but still very happy with my purchase.  And Daffy, Bugs, Pepe, Sylvester and the gang kept me laughing or giggling the whole time.  Hope they release more of these in the future.  May not be as perfect as the Gold Collection (from what I read in reviews), but it is good to me!",1201392000,8,783,4.173333333333333

2910062,2,B000TSTEMI,"I've bought either the Spotlight or Golden collections right along and noticed the quality going down each year and this last volume is the thinnest yet. You know Warner Brothers Co is dragging this series out so they can max out their profits, but this is an exceptionally weak line up when you consider the library they can draw from.

I know if the next installment isn't any better I'm cutting things off here. If you haven't bought this yet - take a closer look at what's in here and you may pass. I know I should have.",1196812800,16,524,4.346938775510204
2910063,3,B000TSTEMI,If your buying the looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Volume 5 your really missing out. The Spotlight Collection only has the Bugs and Daffy and the Fairy Tales Disc. The Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 5 has an entire disc devoted to Bob Clampett and an entire disc of black and white cartoons including the two discs that are included in the Spotlight Collection.,1194134400,2,370,4.888888888888889
2910064,5,B000TSTEMI,"This year's Spotlight Collection is a viable alternative to the Golden Collection volume 5, and a lot cheaper too.  This set has the very best of the fifth Golden Collection, namely the Bugs/Daffy disc and the Fairy Tales disc.  These are the only discs you need from this year's Golden Collection unless you are a Bob Clampett fan, a fan of the 70s and 80s TV specials, or like the really, really old, badly dated cartoons from the 30s and early 40s.",1193356800,21,451,4.487804878048781
2910065,4,B000TSTEMI,"Last year I chose the Spotlight Collection over the Golden Collection to spare my library all the Speedy Gonzales shorts. Frankly, the humor is all the same in that series.

2910066,3,B000TSTEMI,"With the upcoming Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 5 on the horizon,. many die hard fans are anxious to see some of the best animated classics from the Warner Brothers library all over again. But, whenever they've made the most with the hype of the Golden Collections, they unfortunately have a budget version called the spotlight collection. Although they are inexpensive, it just doesn't drive as much to die hard fans, as the case that others have. The only one that clicked from the budget collection was the Looney Tunes: Movie Collection which was Volume 3, because it was completely different from the others ones. Now that a new edition is set to make it to the stores in a few months, does the spotlight shine or dim on the smaller collection?

The Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection, Volume 5 is a 2 disc DVD set which highlights a smapling of the upcoming Golden Collection Volume 5. The cartoons have been remastered well, but it does miss out and doesn't highlight as much for die hard fans, as much as it tries to being new fans of the classic cartoon series. The first disc mainly features Bugs Bunny, like it did on the previous Golden Collections. This one however, does feature a twist as Bugs has to share the spotlight one of his rivals, Daffy Duck. There aren't as many Bugs cartoons here as there were before, and doesn't really highlight as many shorts were Bugs and Daffy battled with their wits, considering most of hose greats were used from the previous Golden Collections. The only three cartoons that shows Bugs & Daffy duking it out, mainly show in the Bing Crosby & Bob Hope relationship Chuck Jones directed towards the two of them in classic like Ali-Baba Bunny, and the quirky Abominable Snow Rabbit, and A Star Is Bored which Friz Freleng portraits Daffy being a double for Bugs on a movie set. Other than that there both sharing there greats here in classics like Bugs' Bonnets where Bugs is head to head against Elmer Fudd, but taking on the serious guises of hats that show too much personality, and The Stupor Salesman ( one of the animated greats directed by unsung and overshadowed director Art Davis), which Daffy flexes his salesman muscles, refusing to take no for an answer from a wanted criminal just to make a buck. I just honestly wished that more cartoons which showed Bugs vs. Daffy in the looney ways possible could've been shown here like The Million Hare and Beanstalk Bunny. Which remains unfortunate, considering all the good ones like Show Biz Bugs, and Rabbit Seasoning, were used in previous volumes.

The second disc is mainly a fairy tale remake series in where the Looney Tunes gang takes on knockoffs of classic stories like Goldimouse & The three Cats which features a mouse who intrudes a house where Sylvester & Sylvester Jr. live for food and shelter, which leaves Sylvester Jr. craving for something other than pourage, a mouse. Also, Bewitched Bunny, a knockoff of the Hansel & Gretel story that is the debut of Witch Hazel, one of Bugs' overlooked foes, and the lessker-known Senorella & The Glass Hurache, a Mexican version of the classic Cinderella story which was one of the first toons that Warner brothers made after leaving the legendary Termite Terrace in the 1960's.

All in all, The Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection Volume 5 could've been a bit better. It leaves a lot missing for new fans, and doesn't draw enough for longtime fanatics and classic animation collectors. Insead, I absolutely recommend Looney Tunes fans await the upcoming Golden Collection Volume 5 instead. There are many more greats there, including classics from the early 1930's from Porky Pig, and a tribute to legendary animator Bob Clampett. This shows that spotlight has dimmed further on the budget series.

2910068,4,B000TSTEMI,I purchased this DVD for my collections. I am a big Looney Tunes fan. I grew up watching them as a kid.
