3783163,4,B001S2Q5UI,"I think that this short would make for a great feature length film... or even a great mini-series for HBO or SYFY. The Union certainly showed the potential it has to run with the big dogs.
The behind-the-scenes extras on the making of this short was very insightful as to the hard work that goes into making a film from conception to delivery, and hopefully beyond.
I want to see what happens next!",1248393600,,398,4.465753424657534
3783164,4,B001S2Q5UI,"I found this to be an entertaining short, great story and effects for an indie style studio.

The in depth special features should be required viewing for anyone interested in film production.",1248307200,,192,5.0
3783165,2,B001S2Q5UI,"I must not have read the description correctly, this movie was not at all what I expected and very disappointing.  A waste of money.  Vendor is good though and is certainly not responsible for poor movie.",1247443200,,204,4.638888888888889
8339352,4,B001S2Q5UI,"This small project has a lot of heart put into it and has the potential to be great, it just needs some funds. Imagine where this story could go and how it could expand..Many films start somewhere and don't have the benefit of big budgets, so when watching this keep that in mind and maybe not be so critical and see what it COULD be. I hope to one day see what happens as a feature length film/series. I thought it was enjoyable.",1258502400,,430,4.192771084337349
8339353,1,B001S2Q5UI,"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST SHORT FILMS I EVER SEEN.
I BET YOU THAT THE 4 AND 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE FROM THE TEAM FRIENDS.
DON'T BUY THIS HORRIBLE FILM!!!",1257206400,,148,3.806451612903226
8339354,5,B001S2Q5UI,I thought this was a great short film and would love to see it made into a feature length film!  There's so much more of the story to be told and I'm so curious!  I liked the plot of the feud between covens and the guardian's story.  Definitely worth checking out! =),1249430400,,267,4.096153846153846
8339355,5,B001S2Q5UI,"Great amateur acting!  Lancaster was awesome, so much feeling there, made me wish I was Lithia!  It made me feel like I was back in the Days of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table with all the romance and chivalry included!  It needs to me made into a full length story, so many possibilities here.  The ending will grab you!!",1249084800,,337,4.301587301587301
8339356,5,B001S2Q5UI,"""The Union,"" is a nicely shot short film, and demonstrates the multi-talents of writer-director, Tom Laughlin.  Laughlin is a young and coming player in the field.  We really like his craftsmanship, his casting, his angles, his creativity and attention to details.  We certainly look forward to seeing more of his creative works on the big screen.  The filming of ""The Union"" clearly demonstrates Laughlin would be a valuable addition to any major studio or film company looking to land budding, creative new talent.

8339357,5,B001S2Q5UI,"Watching ""The Union"" for the very first time made me laugh a little at first because A)it started out looking like one of those low budget films and B) I'm not too much into Vamires. After watching it again, I put myself past all that and into the movie, focusing on the actual plot that exists (unlike a lot of these other Hollywood vampire flicks).

""The Union"" is EXTREMELY well acted considering these actors and actresses are NOT professional high-paid movie stars! The movie is a short...the only damper...and makes you want to see more.

Definately give this film a go! You'll be suprised at what ""The Union"" has to offer!",1248825600,,629,4.657657657657658
8339358,5,B001S2Q5UI,"This film, by Tom Laughlin, is an exciting, well-directed and awesome short that belongs in the collection all dark Gothic film lovers. It's a great intriguing story with fine acting from the entire cast. The quality of the photography is very high quality. Buy this DVD, ""The Union"" now and be one of those that get to say, ""Hey, I have the original short of 'The Union'"" when it becomes a feature.

8339359,5,B001S2Q5UI,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It was well made and had an interesting story.  It was much better than most of the independent shorts out there (they seem to be everywhere these days, sadly only some - like this one - are worth the time and money).  The dvd contains really cool behind the scenes extras as well, a must see for budding filmmakers.

Highly recommended to fans of the genre and anyone interested in good independent film!",1248652800,,438,4.576923076923077
8339360,4,B001S2Q5UI,"I've watched this short several times.  I found it well written and directed.  If you are an artist you will appreciate the techniques used in its production.  This movie is totally worth every penny.  You must realize how hard it is for these low budget or no budget artists. It must be truly a labor of love.  Hay, I don't even like vampires or guns.  Buy it, you'll like it!",1248652800,,377,4.314285714285714
8339361,5,B001S2Q5UI,"""The Union"" draws you in from the very start. The film shots are well-placed, the acting is solid and the intensity level high. So much happens in this 15-minute short. Plus, the ending leaves you desperately wanting to see more. This film is a rock-solid effort with a world of potential if made into a feature-length film.",1248652800,,324,4.701754385964913
