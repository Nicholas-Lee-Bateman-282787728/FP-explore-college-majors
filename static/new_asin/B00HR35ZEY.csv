6199251,5,B00HR35ZEY,both worth the money!,1412035200,,21,4.5
6199252,4,B00HR35ZEY,"Great movies, Great 3D EFFECTS. Journey 2 comes with spanish audio, but Joruney to the center of the earth doesn't",1410307200,,114,4.75
6199253,5,B00HR35ZEY,I saw bits of both of these movies at Stone Mountain's 4D theater.  The full length ones did not disappoint!,1406764800,,108,4.4
6199254,4,B00HR35ZEY,"I originally saw this movie because I loved 1959 Journey to the Center of the Earth with James Mason. It is a movie that reminds me of my childhood and time with my father.

I purchased these movie because I want to share more good movies with my small children. They really enjoyed it in 3D.
I was only going to purchase Journey to the center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser; Journey 2 came as a bonus.
I don't believe I will watch Journey 2 again unless my children want me to watch it with them.

In summary these are cheese movies, but they were perfect to show to my innocent children (7-11 years old), clean, fun movies that were enjoyed by the family.",1406246400,13,659,4.264
6199255,3,B00HR35ZEY,"fun movies for the family.  watch the backpacks in Journey to the Cemter of the Earth. It appears,
disappears and re-appears with great frequency.
Journey 2 is not nearly as good.  the father character (who flies the plane) is particularly annoying.
So I would probably rate Journey 1 as a 3, Journey 2 as a 2.",1404345600,,310,4.517857142857143
6199256,4,B00HR35ZEY,"Both movies take Jules Vern classics and add a modern day twist. In the first movie ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" we have the volcano in Iceland and people go down into it and come out a volcano in the end, other than that the classic novel is not really followed.  It is a fun movie and enjoyable.  Journey Two is based on the Vern novel, Mysterious Island.  There is not much in common with the book, other than a reference to Captain Nemo and they end up on the Nautilus.  Michael Cain add some class to the movie.  As a tow pack it is a good value and makes a fun Saturday.",1402876800,9,584,4.043478260869565

The movies themselves are hokey, corny... but OK, better than most things on TV. The 3D quality of Journey to the Center of the Earth was quite a bit better than, uh, the other one, I already forget the name, but the other was at least very colorful, eye-candy-ish, and the one starlet was also very eye-candy-ish, I forget her name...

The first movie journey to the center of the earth sets the story for the main character who is the boy searching for his father. In the second movie the boy used govnerment hacked into government equip basically to help get a Morse code cryptogphic like message, which turns out was from his grandfather who was trapped with no way off the mysterious island.

If you liked either of these movies and haven't seen both or just looking for both these movies this set is the way to go. Just make sure you have a bluray player for the bluray discs and have a great movie night full of adventure.",1439164800,,753,4.371428571428571

6199361,4,B00HR35ZEY,I originally saw the first movie a few years back and wasn't all that impressed.  But watching it now on a 3D tv was a completely different experience.  It was a very enjoyable ride of 3d effects.  I've seen about a dozen 3d movies so far on my new tv and I must say that this was the best at utilizing the 3d technology.,1427241600,,321,3.984375

6199364,4,B00HR35ZEY,"Although these movies are based on Jules Verne's books (Journey To The Center Of The Earth & The Mysterious Island), they really are completely different stories. Still, very entertaining and updated for a more (family) fun version. Plus, the Dolby sound and 3D is outstanding making you feel like you are really there.

Journey to the Center of the Earth was really enjoyable with the best 3D effects while Journey 2 - The Mysterious Island was entertaining but the storyline was lacking as well as the 3D effects. Both movies have really good sound.

I'm happy to have these movies in my collection and will enjoy seeing them again and sharing the experience.",1426464000,2,661,4.84070796460177

6199367,1,B00HR35ZEY,"Journey to the center of the earth was a 3D disc....but to my dismay part 2 Journey to the mysterious island was a regular DVD.

I thought it was odd there was a piece of clear tape on top/bottom of the case. It was obviously opened. Also one had a UV papar , while the other didnt.

Extremely fishy if you ask me.
I will try and contact seller first before I return.....but 1 star until this is resolved.",1424131200,2,405,4.113924050632911

6199380,3,B00HR35ZEY,"Purchased this for my little nephew who saw ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" con cable.  He kept asking to watch the movie again, so I purchased this 2 DVD set for him.  Of the two discs, ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" is by far the better of the two movies. Not worth the price for a 2 DVD set.",1415750400,,301,4.084745762711864
