8524707,3,B0083TS8L8,"Although this film is a little dated I bought it as I had seen it a long time ago and it still has some life left in it. It is a story that has been told before but it is interesting to see a film of that period. It is also nice to see it as a bit of social history as the incidentals show what was going in on the UK at the time.
I also was to keen on seeing an early film with Sir Donald Sinden yes he really went on to achieve a great deal and showed what a versaitile actor he really is.",1379808000,,491,3.5555555555555554
8524708,3,B0083TS8L8,"Don't be taken by the marketing hyperbole for 'Eyewitness' (UK, 1956), which compares the film to Hitchcock suspense classics 'Dial M for Murder,' 'Rear Window,' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' -- it's a laughable exaggeration as the screenplay expends far too much effort on ancillary matters (comic relief and romance involving minor characters) and far too little on the central plot to build anything but a marginal level of tension.  Still, it's a pleasant Rank production with some memorable elements and solid performances.  The widescreen image quality is reasonably good, with only a few artifacts evident, although the audio is weak enough that I opted to make use of the subtitles.  No extras.  Movie rates 3 stars, presentation 2 1/2.",1372896000,3,746,5.090163934426229
8524709,5,B0083TS8L8,This is the DVD of this movie. The DVD played. I don't think it is fair to review this product poorly just because the film is boring!,1362873600,,134,4.0
8524710,1,B0083TS8L8,This may be a good movie. I wouldn't know. I don't watch movies that have been time compressed. VCI should know better than this since they're market is the movie collector who doesn't like time compression and pan and scan.,1362096000,,224,4.625
