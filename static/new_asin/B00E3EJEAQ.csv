8600569,5,B00E3EJEAQ,"Any fan of Indie women's wrestling should check every Shine and Shimmer DVD they run across! This particular one was amazing! Mia Yim vs Jessicka Havoc is worth it, alone! Epic match! Sienna Duvall vs Satana was pretty awesome, as well as Leva Bates vs Kimberly. This is a MUST HAVE for REAL women's wrestling fans who are sick of watered-down, force-feed, crappy ""Diva"" wrestling from live syndicated television every week.",1389657600,,424,4.985915492957746
