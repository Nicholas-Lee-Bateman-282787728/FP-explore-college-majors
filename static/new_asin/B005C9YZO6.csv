8464960,5,B005C9YZO6,"I actually purchase this for myself , A long time ago I was babysitting my nephew during Christmas time for the weekend and this happened to be on. We watched it together he enjoyed it and I particular enjoyed it because they don't make Christmas cartoons like this anymore about the meaning of Christmas. Not the religious meaning of Christmas which is my meaning  or Santa but The caring, the sharing, loving others and spending time with family and friends. When it was shown a long time ago it was not immediately available on DVD, Than I came across it on Amazon the week it was released and snatched it up. It makes you feel all fuzzy and warm inside. Its a movie, with extras of shorts, either a Christmas theme or some kind of lesson. Christmas is my favorite time of the year, and love everything from Santa to The Grinch. But sometime you want something that reminds you of what Christmas is all about, Its been along time since Charlie Brown Christmas was first aired and this ranks right up there with Charlie Brown. Maybe not a classic but it will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside..",1482192000,,1098,4.49
8464961,5,B005C9YZO6,"My grandson has LOVED Franklin since he was 2 years old. He is 4 now and still loves Franklin. I bought this for him as a Christmas gift and he loved it. I like the lessons that it teaches young children, lessons like: giving, sharing, being kind to others, and many others. This DVD has 5 different episodes on it:

- Franklin's Christmas Gift
- Franklin's School Play
- Franklin's Homemade Cookies
- Franklin Snoops
- Franklin Plays Hockey

I like that each of these episodes are only about 10 - 15 minutes long, so it keeps young children's attention well. And it make it easier to turn it off after ""just one more.""",1464048000,,619,4.421052631578948

8464963,3,B005C9YZO6,"Grandkids enjoyed it but being two and four, they didn't even know who Franklin was.  Maybe if they were a bit older, it would have been a bigger hit.",1424217600,,150,4.172413793103448
8464964,4,B005C9YZO6,My son who likes Franklin received this as a gift last year. You get to see what Franklin does for Christmas. Very appropriate for young kids.,1411689600,,142,4.5
