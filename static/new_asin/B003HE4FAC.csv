8397079,4,B003HE4FAC,"Street Boss is non stop from beginning to end.  Being from Saginaw I found it very interesting to see local places in the movie.  After seeing the movie and a book club meeting with the FBI agent with whom this movie is based on, I am glad to know ""some"" liberties were taken in the movie.",1358121600,2,289,4.142857142857143

8397081,4,B003HE4FAC,"I was fortunate enough to be among the 'red carpet' VIPs at the film's premiere, at Saginaw's historic Temple Theater.  It was an enjoyable evening memorably hallmarked by the debut of this fantastic film.  While I agree there were some humorous moments that were perhaps best characterized as 'corny,' the overarching presentation was excellent.  The modernized and fictionalized story of the Detroit Partnership's (read Mafia Family's) infiltration of mid-Michigan was well-done, offering intrigue to both the educated and un-indoctrinated viewer alike.  There were moments that felt startlingly authentic, as well as those which resonated with invention.  Taken as a complete work, however, the film is more authentic and accessible than any number of movies with many more times the budget.  I would watch it again and again.",1289088000,,829,5.488188976377953
8397082,1,B003HE4FAC,"What a complete let down! This movie should be classified as ""Below Average"". The description and cover photograph of the DVD is misleading and deceiving. First of all Vincent Pastore is shown on the frame cover front and back(largest image of him)appearing to portray an active role when in fact he only appears in the movie for no more than five minutes! The acting was terrible! A disappointment for Nicholas Turturo who was excellent in the movie""Witness to the Mob"",Carmen Argenziano was dressed too flashy to be at home alone waiting for her hubby to come home,Robert Gallo and Mark Bierlein gave a below average performance and last but not least the worst performance goes to Reggie Gaskins and Edward Carnavale.",1286928000,,720,4.958677685950414
8397083,4,B003HE4FAC,"Okay I'll admit that I will voraciously eat up anything gangster! I'm normally a stickler for fact and details, but even I will sometimes loosen up and let myself be whisked away once and a while by a Hollywood version of a gangster story, whether they be cheesy or not. That's called entertainment.
First off, I do have an affinity for this movie because of a great actor and friend that stars in it named Mr. Robert Gallo. I know first hand that he puts his heart and dedication in his acting since his first tv acting gig in 1975. He's been in shows like Falcon crest, Archie Bunker's place, St. Elswhere, The Paper Chase, Hill Street Blues etc.
He's played in several movies and pulled off a terrific Al Capone in his one man theatre play called ""The King of the City"" This play lead to my association to Gallo.

In the movie called Street Boss, Gallo plays mob king pin Tony Jack, that is based on a real gangster Tony Giacalone, who was running nefarious things as a capo in Detroit. Gallo plays his character as a genuine A -hole by tormenting and slapping his nephew Nicholas Turturro around like a rag doll.

I truly enjoyed Gallo's portrayal of Tony Jack, to the point that by the end of the movie, I totally detested the character he played. That in my book shows that he pulled off his acting job to the nines. For my part, I think he and Turturro saved this movie. Can't wait for him to be cast in a serious and historically accurate mobster movie or series. Turturro also played his part in it without a hitch.

The only negatives for me in this movie was Edward Carnevale cast as an unconvincing, almost funny version of a mob hood and the comedic relief the producers or director somehow felt they needed in there between the FBI agents. That took the all the seriousness of the subject away, which was Tony Jack's ruthless extotion and killings. Nothing funny about that. Guess that's entertainment and I certainly was entertained watching this gem of an independant film.",1284163200,3,1989,4.519444444444445
