8343426,1,B001UE7BY8,Absolutely a horrible movie.  I should learn to read other reviews before I waste my money on horrible movies.  I can't find one reason to waste your time or your money to watch such garbage.  Nearly 2 hours of my life I'll never get back along with the rental fee.  To think they offer a 7 day watching period for this movie.  I'd have be insane to ever watch it again.,1474675200,,370,4.154929577464789

8343428,1,B001UE7BY8,"Terrible acting, poor photography, poor props.  Looks like indoor scenes were done in empty buildings.  Awful music as well.  Plot?  Did not even bother to find out.",1473724800,,165,5.0
8343429,1,B001UE7BY8,How Corbin Bernsen and Tom Atkins (a big favorite of mine) got trapped in this turkey is beyond my imagination. Actually I'm guessing as working actors they got a solid days pay for their time and moved on. The production is similar to that of a Saturday Night Live spoof... the set design amateurish..most of the acting amateurish and the whole thing is just unwatchable. SPARE yourself the mind numbing experience.,1353024000,2,416,4.873239436619718
8343430,4,B001UE7BY8,"As a producer on this film, I have a unique perspective.  I knew the script, I saw the film being shot, and I watched pieces of the editing process.  However, it wasn't until we screened the film for an audience that I really got a feeling for the film.  The script read like a murder mystery, but as the film played out on screen - there were a number of scenes where the audience ended up laughing.  That's when I realized that although meant to be a murder/mystery type of film, it comes across more like a black comedy.

There are some great one liners in the film.  1) Where were you yesterday morning?  Wait a minute, it's coming back to me now....I was in bed....with your mother.  2) I've been doing this long enough, that I can smell a murderer, and Mr....You Stink!  3) Sorry?  I think we're a little late for sorry! - look at her, she's dead!

When I watch the film in it's entirety, I'm reminded of other black comedy films, such as ""The Ice Harvest"" with John Cusack and ""Fargo"".

Give it a try, and all of us at Winter Morning Pictures hope that you enjoy it!

8343431,4,B001UE7BY8,"Yet another local film company is making the case that good films can be made in our own backyard.

""Trapped,"" the first feature-length film from Winter Morning Pictures, premiered Sunday at the SouthSide Works Cinema. Fans of quirky murder-gone-wrong films in the ""Fargo"" tradition might want to catch the film when it's available on dvd.

Winter Morning Pictures shoots films using local talent, crew and locations. ""Trapped,"" a noir thriller with a body count nearly as high as local taxes, was shot in Aspinwall, Fox Chapel, Edgewood and Regent Square. The only Hollywood import of note is Corbin Bernsen, who plays a millionaire businessman murdered by his unfaithful wife (Dana Hardy) and his business partner Ty (Tony Bingham). Naturally, not everything goes according to plan, and paranoia, double-crosses, blackmail and more killings ensue.

Aspinwall resident Gavin Rapp, formed Winter Morning Pictures with partners Ron Hankison, Mike Hamilton, Jim Hamilton and Jay Mangold. Rapp co-directed and co-wrote the script with Hankinson. During a post-screening talk Sunday, Rapp said the characters in the film are an amalgam of people he's known -- a scary notion, because two of the most colorful characters are the murderous Liam, played by bald, hulking Jeff Carpenter, and thrill-seeking ingnue Mandy, played by Alexandra Cherney.

While ""Trapped"" can't avoid some predictable stock characters, the acting is mostly solid. Tom Atkins has fun with the role of a flinty detective, while cinematographer Rich Schutte infuses clarity and pop to each bridge, skyline and street.

Not bad for the first time feature film makers- Winter Morning Pictures.",1243814400,4,1658,5.410852713178294
