1619739,1,B00005KCB8,"This film, together with ""Alexandra's Project"", has got to be the lamest excuse for promoting porn, under the banner of so-called art, that I have ever seen. This film has absolutely no substance, and the sex scenes are as erotic as a dog humping a pillow.

This film has brought shame rather than praise to the Australian Film Industry.",1141430400,2,337,4.711864406779661
1619740,5,B00005KCB8,"Apart from featuring constant screen cigarette smoking, this Australian film directed by John Curran defies expectations. Set in a Brisbane boarding house it presents Peter Fenton as an asthmatic who begins a romance with eczema sufferer Sacha Horler. Curran's formal style lessens the grunginess of the locale, though at times he overdoes the soundtrack with aural effects, so we can concentrate on the phenonema of the relationship. What is remarkable about the treatment is that neither of the characters are shown to be losers, in spite of their physical challenges. Rather there is much emphasis on flesh, in particular Horler's physical insatiablity and the demand it makes on Fenton. In response to Horler's comment that she thinks herself ""hideous"", Curran cuts to a crowd's apparent look of disapproval which is later revealed to be their fear of being group photographed.
In spite of the suggestion that Horler is a monstrous child/woman, the actor invests her with a vulnerability that is very appealing. And Fenton's tenderness is also pleasing.
The film suffers without Horler, and Curran doesn't know how to end, which may be the fault of the source novel by Andrew McGahan. Depicting residents of a boarding house as men without dreams or levity is perhaps too easy, but at least we get to see a physical transformation. Curran repeats one set-up from a longer shot, which predetermines the ending, and provides an amusing if inexplicable parallel between the boarding house and a hospital ward after hours.",1004572800,9,1522,5.165991902834008
7943190,4,B00005KCB8,"This is a much-talked about Australian film, but the storyline is rather confronting.  It details the relationship between two dysfunctional people, whose main interest in life is sex and drugs for the woman, played superbly by Sacha Horler, and the shiftless man upon, out of work and unmotivated, on whom she focuses her attention.
The two main actors are very convincing in their roles, and there is a small part played by the ever-convincing Marta Dusseldorp.  Not an uplifting experience, but worth watching because it received great acclaim at the time it was released.",1414800000,,575,5.1063829787234045

7943198,5,B00005KCB8,"After hearing about the Go Fish guys from my daughter, I bought this (and 2 other DVDs) for my grandchildren, in particular the younger ones who are so limited in what they should watch. A huge hit! It is so much fun to watch young children enthralled with safe, healthy and uplifting entertainment. The guys can sing and have certainly identified a grand way to reach the children. My grandchildren (ages 1 - 7) danced and danced and sang along time after time. I thought it was wonderful to listen to as well and found myself moving along with them. It made me smile and I am quite certain that it made God smile too.",1384128000,2,619,4.391304347826087
