2404664,5,B000B7MXGQ,"The first few minutes of the movie, I was thinking it must pick up, and that IT DID!  I was totally captivated by this story knowing it's based on a true story, which I'd never heard about.  Romance, drama, comedy and an ending........you watch & see.",1377302400,2,251,4.434782608695652
2404665,5,B000B7MXGQ,"Just watched this tonight with my wife. We were both enthralled throughout. It also has a moral point, though the main character is completely immoral. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure, crime, love-gone-wrong, or just about any other type of movie. Get it, you won't regret it.",1328832000,,310,4.867924528301887
2404666,3,B000B7MXGQ,"The movie itself is in great shape so no problems there. I was just not all that impressed with the movie itself. Jeff Fahey looks a lot older here and not up to a standard of acting that I have seen him in previous movies (Wrangler and Lawnmower Man) I guess this movie just seemed a bit unreal to me. I know that truth is stranger than stories most times but there was just something missing in this flick. I can't put my finger on it...maybe the script and the acting. I will give this to my daughter in law who is much younger and maybe she will like this movie! It just didn't hold a lot of suspense for me or edge of the seat nail biting drama. I think it needed a bit more ""grit""! The young girl playing the step daughter did the best acting of them all!  I am maybe a hopeless romantic and want things to turn out good or if they are bad...make them REALLY bad!",1325203200,4,869,4.0523255813953485
2404667,4,B000B7MXGQ,"It was a well acted and arresting movie. Shows how easy it can be to become involved with another person;the only ingredients necessary being opportunity,ego and lust. Would recommend this for anyone who wonders how things like this happen.",1308096000,,240,5.17948717948718
2404668,5,B000B7MXGQ,"This movie, based on a book by Karen Kingsbury, was great! It was very suspenseful and had a shocking ending. My husband even watched it with me and enjoyed it.",1168646400,6,160,4.366666666666666
2404679,4,B000B7MXGQ,"This movie began as a rather dark comedy, but eventually changed to a dark and tragic account of the real life story of David Russell Miller and his two wives.  There's a narrator to the story, but the viewer doesn't discover the identity of the narrator until the end of the film.  It's hard to imagine that people can be taken in by such con/narcisstic individuals.  From what I've read online about David Russell Miller, the story seemed to highlight and follow the most important parts of this tragic story very well.  His wives names were changed.  I think Kim Cattrall gave the best performance in the film.  I'm sure any true crime book written about this evil man would be a good read, but the movie isn't a bad way to learn about this total creep!!!  I'm surprised that he didn't get the death penalty in Florida.",1512691200,,822,4.513513513513513
2404680,5,B000B7MXGQ,"I enjoyed watching the fast moving plot of a man being a compulsive liar, bigamist and womanizer ...it was even funny in scenes, yet it is sad movie in that someone is so mentally ill and able to ruin so many others' lives like he did.  Jeff Fahey's hair bothered me as it was dyed so dark black that it didn't look real.  He looked like a 55 year old guy trying to look 35.",1512345600,,374,3.973333333333333
2404681,4,B000B7MXGQ,"Yes, I enjoyed this movie. I watch with captions so I avoided some of the irritating comedic voices that other reviewers complained about, likewise concerning the music. I thought the blonde starter wife was absolutely gorgeous and of course, we all know how beautiful Kim Catrell is. Others have mentioned how Jeff Fahey is underrated and I must agree. I would rather watch him than some of the top male stars of today. I know the story is based on truth so no defense is necessary but I don't understand why he is considered a con man. Aren't they usually love bandits who enrich themselves through their bigamy? He not only did not do this, he strapped himself into serious financial trouble trying to support two households including two step children even. I still don't understand how he did it and where his money came from. I really liked the movie, the actors and the scenery.",1510012800,,885,4.67948717948718
2404682,5,B000B7MXGQ,"Really good movie
I lent mine to a friend and she kept it

2404684,5,B000B7MXGQ,Jeff Fahey is a very underrated and overlooked actor. I thought he played the part of a bigamist and womanizer right to the tee. Kim Cattrall was also very good in this movie as well.  The cast overall was very good. Definitely worth a watch.,1473638400,,242,4.377777777777778

2404686,1,B000B7MXGQ,"The title of the book by Karen Kingsbury Deadly Pretender which the movie is based, probably better suits the movie than Every Woman's Dream. For me I found this movie to be boring.  It starts of with a narrator commentating in a fun like almost joking tone like you find at the start of Dr Seuss kids movies, about a boy who enjoys pretending he's living a fantasy life, who grows up to be a compulsive liar.  Being the comedy type voice of the narrator, I was expecting the lying backstory to be light hearted and fun, sort of like a Jim Carey character movie scenes with a lying character or something getting up to some interesting and entertaining stuff.  But this is a based on true life events movie, and since the stuff the real guy got up to was pretty boring, we experience embellishing hand shake photos to mean more, photoshopping (or whatever the style was known of at the time) others, pretending you've inherited a few million dollars, you're a CIA agent and other things that are all pretty mild entertainment wise.

I'm sure the real life women were maybe more intelligent than the characters who got conned in this one, but both came across as annoyingly dumb in this movie.  The movie didn't do a good job in showing how this guy was able to con women, it simply gave the message that they we easily manipulated and not aware of obvious things happening around them.

There's plenty of true crime story movies out there, especially in the low budget made originally for TV genre that this one falls into.  For me did you enjoy watching it?  Was it entertaining?  Would you recommend to your friends they give it a go?  If you could get back the hour and a half of your life you spent watching it would you watch it again.  If the answers to these questions is no, then it's simply not a good movie.",1449619200,,1817,4.442771084337349
2404687,3,B000B7MXGQ,"I had seen this movie before.  So no surprises.  It is well done.  I find the end very sad.  Amazing how people will let themselves be manipulated by charming, lying con artists.  I would recommend it.",1447027200,,201,4.472222222222222
2404688,5,B000B7MXGQ,Why didn't Jeff Fahey ever hit it big??? I think he is one of the best actors around.  He doesn't get the credit he deserves.  Love everything he does.,1444521600,,151,4.172413793103448

2404706,5,B000B7MXGQ,"Mitch is not just a man juggling two wives but is a sociopath which is luckily a milder case. The more severe cases are many times serial killers. But, in this movie Mitch lies to the impth degree to get what he wants and what he wants he feels he deserves no matter what, even threatening his step daughter. Mitch really isn't that bad of a guy. He doesn't want to hurt his two wives but is that ever rational thinking? He's unaware of his own mind-bent condition.
  This movie get's better when Liz (Cattrall ) starts getting suspicious of his career and really starts laying into him. She discovers more skullduggery. Fahey's performance was pretty good, He is quite emotional as expected. Cattrall as an actress always impressive. ""The hardest working actress in showbiz!"". This is a movie that I think most teens and adults would enjoy.",1385942400,2,841,4.675675675675675
2404707,4,B000B7MXGQ,"I like this movie though I though it had wacky music and narration. This movie is suppose to be based on a real series of events.
This movie is about a put simply narcissistic sociopath that unfortunately has looks, charisma, so many lies he could write a handbook on the subject. His name is Mitch and as a consultant and marries a woman named Candice. But he is on the go. She believes every thing he says. He works for the CIA. He has to move his family because of CIA complications.
  Soon he meets the woman interested in marriage and starting a family named Liz Wells ( Kim Cattrell ). He winds up marrying her rather quickly. Well, from that point lies and bills start building up. Liz's father start checking up, Candice starts checking up.
  A Sociopath generally is concerned only for themselves. They generally feed off others. This is an interesting movie for a made for TV movie. I think Kim Cattrall really shines playing an everyday person, yet very intelligent.",1384560000,,977,4.597701149425287

8082815,4,B000B7MXGQ,This is a very cute movie and I have always liked Jeff Fahey since he was on One Life to Live....  The trouble with Hollywood movies saying it is Florida is they always forget Florida is flat as a pancake..  I have been to Floridas high point and it is on Marco Island and is a pile of dirt LOL  There are just way to many high points which sort of spoils it for me.,1523923200,,366,3.8533333333333335
8082816,5,B000B7MXGQ,"Mitch Parker is a cheat, liar, womanizer and a bigamist.  The two women to whom he is married dearly loved him until they realized what a manipulator he was.

The plot is complex and intricate.  The cast is outstanding.  Jeff Fahey as Mitch Parker is outstanding.

The ending is tragic.

I highly recommend this film.  It's well worth your time.",1522886400,,345,4.65
