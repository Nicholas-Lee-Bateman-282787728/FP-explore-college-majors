It would have been nice to get this in only english, but I don't mind the way it is.  He enjoys watching it and it makes him happy so its cool by me.",1250294400,,293,3.85
8325739,1,B000TKCFN6,"Super Race is a pretty simple computer animated sequence of racing, illustrating colors, numbers, and letters - it did keep the attention of my 10-month-old and 27-month-old.  BUT, the program goes through English, Spanish, and French all in one series.  I am not ready to have my 27-month-old get confused with foreign languages yet as he is learning how to count, the alphabet, and his colors.  If the user could chose to present only one language, it would receive 3-stars...I threw out the DVD because I don't want my child to confuse red and rojo or five and cinco!",1194134400,,570,4.737373737373737
