4653020,5,B005CFBZ1G,"Some of the most interesting TV shows comes from the BBC and this 2006 six-episode miniseries is just one example. I nearly fell off my chair laughing a few times just watching the first 25-minute episode! And you are sure to get at least a few guffaws - along with a lot of chuckles - whether you are a wine novice or are well educated on wines.

In 2006 wine critic, author and actor Oz Clarke decided to take British TV star, car racer, beer lover, and wine ignorant James May (who looks a lot like a young Gerard Depardieu - the French actor) on a month long journey through France to see if he could educate May on wine. They traveled in May's Jaguar XJ6, camped out in tents and got to drink some of the rarest and best French wines.

In the first episode Oz asks James what taste he gets from his first taste of a vintage wine. ""Fruit juice!"" is James's reply. But by the end of the month (the end of Episode 6) he is  a wine convert - not that he is giving up beer - and you will have laughed and learned something along the way.

Each episode takes them to a different region ( Provence, Rhone Valley, Alsace, Burgundy, etc) and also focuses on such things as ""wine with food"" (my favorite episode, where James is required to prepare a ""gourmet dinner"" for Oz on a camping stove. Another discuses blending of grapes, while the final episode covers Champagne. Oz even quotes prices (in Euros) for many of the wines they taste. And classic car fans will find a surprise for them (as well as James) in the Champagne episode as well..

I laughed (and learned) while watching this series. I think you will too.

4653029,4,B005CFBZ1G,"I enjoyed this madcap romp through wines and vineyards. Nothing profound but a nice change from the usually over-serious wine info. Oz Clarke certainly has the chops to make this interesting for any wine buff, whatever his or her level of wine knowledge.",1389312000,,254,4.930232558139535
4653030,5,B005CFBZ1G,"Oz Clarke, the wine knowitall teams up with motoring journalist with a good palate, James May on a wine adventure through France. Very educational. Very entertaining.",1376784000,2,166,5.423076923076923
4653031,4,B005CFBZ1G,"this is an extremely funny and partially educational series on wine. i think that it serves its dual purpose for being as irreverent as it is snooty at times. it can be watched by people of all stripes, with or without an interest in wines simply because the characters are so good. the interplay between oz and james shows that the big gap between snob/critic and neophyte can be bridged (with a bit of drinking in between). the mystique of wines is made accessible somehow by the combination of oz showing the brazen and barbarous james the ropes of wine, slowly but surely. and james proves himself to be very astute(with the use of pure instincts) in time and even oz's superior to wine tasting in certain respects. in the end, the inquisitiveness and inventiveness of james seems to coalesce with ozs rigid knowledge for a pleasing meeting of the minds. they are not so different.

if nothing else this is a very entertaining tour through wine country and shows us all how wine drinking should be done. be forewarned, you too may become a wine ponce...",1376438400,,1057,4.652406417112299
4653032,5,B005CFBZ1G,"These guys are a riot and there's a lot of good information about wine.  Relaxing escapist fare, fun for anyone who enjoys an occasional glass.",1372377600,,143,4.72
4653033,5,B005CFBZ1G,"Arrived promptly and in good condition.  Bought as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law, and he was very happy with the gift, as he has read books by Oz & James.",1357344000,,159,4.129032258064516
4653034,4,B005CFBZ1G,"I bought this disk out of a liking for ""Top Gear"" and James May.  This story is quite different, following a journey of discovery by two men who barely speak the same language, at least, wine-wise,  As the episodes progress we are treated to lovely scenery, some extraordinary people, and some ""wine facts"", all while Oz Clark tries to show James the hows and whys of wine.  It is all great fun and you may find yourself making the odd note about what to look for in your next bottle.  I am looking forward to the California series.  I recommend this series highly.",1356393600,,565,4.446601941747573
4653035,5,B005CFBZ1G,"Like a good wine, you've got to let it breathe a little. The show starts off a little more focused on educating James (and therefore the viewer) but as the camaraderie between Oz and James develops the show opens up and becomes a wonderful experience.

I found myself looking ahead to see what wine/location they were going to be talking about, and then buying a wine to match and enjoy while watching the episode.

Now that the California DVD's are out I'll be picking those up as well!",1340928000,,487,4.5227272727272725
4653036,3,B005CFBZ1G,"Oz Clark, wine writer; and James May, gearhead, take off in a Jaguar XjS12, across France, in order that Oz may teach James about wine.  Jame's goal is pretty simple:  To take a learn what a hypothetical ""Tenner"" can buy at a wine shop, and to drink wine.  This show should not be mistaken for a course in oenology or even wine tasting, it's not that serious.  It's something of a grown-up's reality show (both men talk to the camera, about their experience and each other) in French wine country.  James, at least, seems truly interested in learning, if Oz would at least stop the wine babble long enough to teach him something.

To that end, James makes a good analogy early on, reacting to an overload of information and almost no wine drinking (and after a wine spa, where grapes were rubbed on their faces), by bringing Oz into his car oriented world, saying something to the effect of...  It's like I'm teaching you about sports cars and we get a lamborghini, an American sports car which is a lot heavier, and an Italian sports car that is very light, and gives you a sensation of speed, and to give you the idea of driving them, we sit you in a tub of unleaded...  Right on.

Eventually the two men figure out how to work their partnership in this endeavor and settle in to more of a routine.  James learns quickly, and still manages to break through Oz's tendency to run to rituals and gobbletygook.

I would imagine that the best use for this show would be among those who want to like wine but who are surrounded by more wine snobs (or ponces as the show calls them) than drinkers and don't have the space to think for themselves.  In the end, it really does come down to what YOU like, although there are fairly commonsense rules, as James comes to realize.  Some wines go better with oysters than others, and you really don't want to pair a big dry red with a sweet dessert.  But, like any religion, oenology is over run with people who love to quote the Bible more than live it, and James makes a good stand for the Regular Guy, approaching the subject with an open and enthusiastic mind, learning as he goes, and still managing to puncture Oz's oft over inflated terminology balloon.

And the things they can say in Britain...  you'll howl over Oz's description of the physical effects drinking a mature chardonnay will have on a woman...",1333238400,2,2353,4.475409836065574
4653037,5,B005CFBZ1G,James & Oz are always a lot of fun to watch. Educational and very entertaining! Well worth the 25 quid..I mean dollars!,1327190400,,119,4.454545454545454

8465334,2,B005CFBZ1G,It is OK  Nothing special.  A couple funny lines but overall not very entertaining.  Basic wine information which would be OK for someone that knows nothing about wine but not really worth the three hours of your time to learn the basics.,1446940800,,238,4.619047619047619

8465338,4,B005CFBZ1G,"I like the series. While I think that May's ""ignorance"" of wine is a bit of an act for the show, it's still highly entertaining and pretty informative. I originally saw the series online and I did notice that the music on the DVD's I received is different. It's as if the online versions are updated with better music such as a rendition of the John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on accordion on Episode 1. I was a little disappointed when I found this out as I thought it was a clever addition that the DVD version is lacking. Otherwise, a fun and informative series.",1429574400,2,557,4.41747572815534
8465339,5,B005CFBZ1G,"Love Oz and James together. If you like Top Gear or you like to drink or you want to learn about wine, this is a GREAT way to learn. So many useful ""Wine Facts"" throughout, and it's super funny too. Makes you want to hang out with these two in real life. This one focuses on old-world wine so expect a healthy dose of french words here and there.",1419552000,,346,4.028985507246377
8465340,5,B005CFBZ1G,"A highly entertaining adventure where Oz Clarke attempts to ""teach"" James May about wine - how it's made, its flavors, its culture.  Great scenery as they travel across France during a summer trip.",1418342400,,197,4.96969696969697
