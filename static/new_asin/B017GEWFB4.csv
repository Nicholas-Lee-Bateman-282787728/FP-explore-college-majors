8739063,1,B017GEWFB4,"This is one of those politically insensitive films that  were made without thought in the 20s and 30s and which continue even more recently. The entire cast is composed of white people playing Chinese. Warner Oland made a career doing this (he played Charlie Chan, for example) but for actors like Helen Hayes and Lewis Stone and Ramon Navarro, it's just plain silly. It's even worse than Marlon Brando (""Teahouse of the August Moon), Tony Randall (7 Faces of Dr Lao), John Wayne (The Conquerer), Edward G Robinson (The Hatchet Man), and Peter Ustinov (Charlie Chan)",1466726400,2,566,4.895833333333333
8739064,4,B017GEWFB4,"I am a huge Warner Oland fan and purchased this film because of his apprearance in the film. the film is listed as a Pre Code which it is, but this the re release print. You can tell by the MPPA seal on the opening credits & the MGM lion title card at the end which they started using in the late 30's on their B pictures. The film is a novelty of that age enjoy it for what it is, Warner Oland & Lewis Stone also H.B. Warner give their usual fine performances but the rest of the cast is rather wooden Anna May Wong would have been better in the Helen Hayes role.",1448150400,2,564,3.9130434782608696
