7916749,2,B000035Z2F,"The animation was only improved by haveing CG added. Otherwise back to saturday morning cartoons. The music is top notch, even though it was a remix of Johann Sabastian Bach it was very well done, I think he would approve. The plot, silly, but that's just anime. The pace...somebody SHOOT ME!! My God, can you draw it out any longer?! The whole thing could have been fininshed on the first CD!! And it does get preachy, but then again that is the same with all Anime, eco/political/social/american bashing is the norm in almost all anime from Japan. It gets two stars for music and CG animation, that's all.",1078617600,,607,4.62962962962963
7916750,2,B000035Z2F,"This anime isn't one of the best I've ever seen.  It's your ordinary person in a fantastic role, forced to become a hero in a good vs. evil struggle.  In Nazca, a group of Japanese citizens discover they were Incan warriors in a past life.  Sound far-fetched?  Their awakening souls start ruling their being, and friends become enemies.  Will the good student be able to stop his now evil kendo teacher from unleashing the power of creation on the world?
The creators of this anime thought it would be a good idea to mesh computer generated scenes in with the animation.  It wasn't a good idea.  The characters look out of place and distorted whenever the CG backgrounds are used.
Nazca is an all right story, but you can pretty much guess how it's going to end.  I don't feel it's worth purchasing 4 DVD's to see the entire saga.",972345600,3,830,4.486666666666666
7916751,4,B000035Z2F,"This is a well done, intelligent fantasy.  I didn't find the plot to be particularly slow-moving at all [of course, I wasn't expecting explosions  and battles and naked chicks every five seconds: your definition of  ""slow plot"" may vary].  I didn't care for the CGI/animation mix  that was done in certain parts -- it wasn't seamless and I found it to be  distracting; the character animation however is quite pleasing and their  Incan warrior incarnations I thought especially well-designed [historical  innacuracies and all -- this *is* a fantasy, you'll recall].  The opening  JS Bach tune by Eccentric Opera is a nice change from the usual  j-pop.
Overview:  intelligent dialogue and good looking guys fighting  each other in nifty costumes.. works for me! :)",967507200,4,763,5.105691056910569
7916752,2,B000035Z2F,"There's not much wrong with the technical details of this title. The animation is fine, the sound is good, and the music is nice (if remixes of  classical tunes are your cup of tea).
What really bothered me is the  plot. There's nothing wrong with the plot itself, but it moves terribly  s-l-o-w...
After the first disc, all we know is that several people  living in Japan know eachother from previous lives during the time of the  Incan empire. Not too much to show for after 90 minutes of animation,  right?
The complete lack of any progression in the story during the first  disc has put me off buying the others. If you watch anime for interesting  character designs and the animation, you'll enjoy this title. If you watch  anime for the stories being told, I can't recommend this disc.",966902400,,791,4.5928571428571425
7916753,1,B000035Z2F,"I purchased this DVD based on the reviews I had read and frankly I was  disappointed.  When I first heard of it I steered clear of it because I  found the premise of Japanese Inca's to be rediculous at best and as for  the costumes - ugh.  Finally having read what others had said I broke down  and bought it. My mistake.  Normally I have no problem checking reality at  the door when I read a book or watch a show.  But even with a reality check  this thing goes to far.  It's either or in my book I don't buy that  everyone with the exception of one person decides to take up where they  left off 400+ years ago AND have a  ""eco"" sermon preached at me  repeatedly throughout the series. The villians could have and frankly  should have destroyed the good guys when ever they wanted.  The head  villian goes from caring individual to someone that makes Hitler look like  a sweetheart all because of his ""awakened soul""?  Sorry but no  cigar.  I have a realitivly small collection of anime, about 50 DVD's so  far and I've watched it in the past on rented VHS tapes, and frankly in my  opinion this is one of the top 5 stinkers I've ever had the misfortune of  seeing or purchasing.",966816000,,1182,4.263636363636364
7916754,3,B000035Z2F,"Nazca has one of the most beautiful theme songs I've ever heard, but after the first fifteen minutes of the first episode and the last fifteen minutes of the fourth episode the story lost my interest. The artwork is gorgeous  and the song is fantastic but the the plot is slow for the majority of the  episodes 1-4.",964828800,,315,4.413793103448276
7916755,5,B000035Z2F,"I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old daughter, who is an anime addict.  As I do with all her tapes, I previewed it first, and I really enjoyed it.  My daughter, was hesitant to watch it, she usually watches  stuff along the lines of Sailor Moon, Saber Marionettes, etc.  But when she  did, she loved it too!  Intriguing story line and lovely animation, I think  it's a great film!  Very age appropriate for a young teen.",960336000,,426,4.2375
7916756,5,B000035Z2F,"This review supplements the excellent first Islip review. OVERALL: Fantastic.  A must-see for any anime fan, a must-own for many.  MUSIC: Incredible.  Usually in anime DVD's or series, I skip the intro after the  first episode, but the very clever arrangement of one of the old Bach  classics makes me listen to the intro before every episode.  SCORE: also  excellent. CGI: indeed very bad, but instead of Super Nintendo, I was  thinking ""Doom interface"".  GENRE: Most anime fans know that  anime tend to fall into certain types of genre, e.g. magic girl (Sailor  moon,etc), giant robot (Gundam,etc), fantasy role-play (Lodoss,etc), etc.  This is a fantasy type anime, where, (surprise) we have reincarnated heroes  from the past.  These standard features let you get an instant feel for the  show, while the writers constantly find ways to put new spins on things.  The innovation here?  Peru--Inca warriors using kendo technique.  Quite an  novelty!  Some of the history is even right.  Again...highly recommend.",951868800,8,1014,5.2125
7916757,3,B000035Z2F,"This is a twelve-episode anime television program that is based on manga by Mr. Akira Himekawa.  This is a story about reincarnated souls (Inca men and women) who have been reborn as Japanese citizens in Japan.  The main  character of the story is a seventeen year old, Japanese, high school  student, named Kyoji Miura.  His life drastically changes after his kendo  teacher, and his best friend, a man named Tate, injuries an opponent during  a kendo tournament.  Now, Tate is convinced that he is the reincarnation of  an Inca warrior.  Tate also believes that Kyoji is the reincarnation of his  enemy an Inca warrior named Vilca.  Tate, throws away their present  relationship in favor of their previous one, and seeks to create his ideal  world by unleashing an ancient weapon on this world.
  This anime is  interesting in many ways because of the theme of reincarnation and  friendship.  The opening scene and the music to this show are really good,  and I thought the whole Inca bit was unique.  The voice actors in the dub  are good, but the voice actors in the sub are far superior in my personal  opinion, either way whichever version you choose you will not be  disappointed.",951264000,,1187,4.762376237623762
