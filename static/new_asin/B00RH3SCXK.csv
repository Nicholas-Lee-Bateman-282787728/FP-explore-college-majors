8695325,5,B00RH3SCXK,Purchased this for my husband who has always wanted to learn tap-dancing.  He is thoroughly enjoying it.  The instructor starts with the most basic steps and goes through them slowly and concisely so you can easily follow him.  Just what the doctor ordered. :),1525046400,,260,4.863636363636363
8695326,5,B00RH3SCXK,I bought this DVD for my husband who wanted to learn some tap steps as a raw beginner. It's perfect for an adult who has never taken tap lessons before and is uncomfortable with the idea of taking classes at a dance studio. The verbal instruction is clear and easy to understand and the demonstrations are easy to follow. You can repeat each lesson as many times as you need to until you learn the step to your satisfaction. That isn't always possible in a studio class of limited duration with multiple students of various ages.,1523318400,,529,4.520833333333333
8695327,5,B00RH3SCXK,My daughter does musicals. She's a singer/actor  witj little to no dance experience. But she loves  Newsies which has inspired her to learn some tap. Not to mention if she continues in theatre needs some basics dance anyway. However with our current theatre/school schedule we have no time to get to a dance studio so far this has been a great start.,1509753600,,350,4.629032258064516
