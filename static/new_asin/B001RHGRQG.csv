3776236,4,B001RHGRQG,"This is a super economical bang for your buck. There are so many old western shows on here. If you (or your kids) like old, cheesy acting with lots of gun shooting and horses running fast then it is for you. Word of warning, for those who want things PC the Native American terms and treatment are not PC and may merit an open discussion with your children about the way things were.",1352764800,,383,4.260273972602739

8337998,5,B001RHGRQG,"Lone Ranger fans will truly enjoy. Not only do we have the Tv Lone Ranger that almost everyone born between 1930 and 1985 know and love, but the ultra-rare 1938 serial. This one is about as much fun as the TV or radio show. The picture is a tad blurry and could stand remastering, but its tolerable if you are of the generation that still remembers black and white television and movies. The serial is a well-told early version of the tale of the ambush of the LR and his fellow Texas Rangers, and his dedication to a life of crime fighting as a result. The serial's major story of a crooked politician who tries the use the state of Texas as his own financial fifedom is well told and keeps you excited through each chapter.

The viewer may compare this to the original 1949 episodes of the TV show with the beloved team of Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels. This beings with the later version of the tale of the Texas Ranger ambush and the rescue by Tonto. (NOTE-Contrary to present-day politically correct popular belief, the naming of Tonto with the Spanish colloquialism for ""stupid"" was an accident. ""Tonto"" was actually a Potawatomi Indian word for ""Wild One."" However, he is referred to as ""Toro"" in Spanish speaking countries). Two color episodes from the show's last season are included.

This includes some good episodes of the Cisco Kid and some other obscure TV westerns of the 1950s (along with one from the legendary Roy Rogers). Good Saturday afternoon viewing. Hi you silver! Away!",1364860800,5,1498,4.670454545454546

8338000,4,B001RHGRQG,this is a really good value compilation of old tv western series as with most of these sets there is some duplication picture quality good as is the sound considering the age of the material. WELL DONE,1358035200,4,201,4.45945945945946
