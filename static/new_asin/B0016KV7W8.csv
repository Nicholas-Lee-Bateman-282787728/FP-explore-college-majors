3158061,4,B0016KV7W8,"Is Burst Angel the best anime series that has ever been made?  No, most certainly it is not.  Is Burst Angel one of the most entertaining series that you can see that features an all female main cast (excluding our little cook)?  Yes!

While this is an anime full of fanservice, from skimpy outfits to the ever amusing episode at the water park, Burst Angel is a series that tailors itself to a younger male audience looking for some nice eye candy in with their violence.  It doesn't actually make this a bad series, and it doesn't in any way fall flat like so many fanservice anime series (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Najica-Blitz-Tactics-Complete-Collection/dp/B001N2WJ1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Najica Blitz Tactics: Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;).  There is a deeper plot and deeper characters in this series, but you do have to watch carefully to catch that.  The relationships between our heroines is at time strained but always close and caring, even when the latter aspect is masked by a sense of duty or revenge.

Set in the future, where we have a pleasant mix of the old and new (think advanced mecha and a still early 21st century society) we find three young women and one little girl all drawn together by circumstance to do the jobs they are assigned to do.  Whether or not Jo, Meg, Sei and Amy agree with the tasks they are handed is ultimately inconsequential and the price of either finishing the job or saving the ever unlucky Meg is often a problem for Jo and the rest.  The plot centers around RAPT - a corrupt amalgam of a police force and private security contractor - the company that Sei's father is a part of in a big way, and the stories of the girls and what brought them together.

You have the spoilt but technologically brilliant Amy and Jango (her giant robot) who is both typical for a young girl and far beyond her years, Meg who is a tough cookie on the exterior but possesses a heart of gold, Sei who is the stern older sister/mother figure, and Jo the quiet and somewhat psychotic killer who betrays none of the emotion she feels.  At first the series seems like a disjointed progression of battles set in a very high-noon end of days duel style, with little else to tie everything together.  Don't be fooled, there is a deeper story hidden in the tiny tidbits that the first episodes reveal.  As our story progresses we aren't spared the shoot-em-up violence that makes this show so much fun, nor will our characters dress more decently.  What we are treated to is more information, just enough to highlight a conspiracy that slowly comes to light, about Jo, RAPT, and the state of Tokyo.

While the end of the series can leave you wondering where all these little threads have come together if you have watched carefully the full vision of Burst Angel is realized.  If you want to watch this series as a one-off, taking it an episode at a time with days between you will still enjoy it.  It's interesting enough and easy enough to grasp that you aren't going to be missing the overall show by watching it and putting it away for some far more serious fare.  In addition, much like any serious anime the love aspects are kept very subtle so you aren't ever going to get a full on heavy love scene between Jo and Meg - though the entire series makes it incredibly clear that this is an anime and not a Western series.  That isn't a bad thing, but if you're looking for a lesbian love fest you aren't going to get it, and that's something that makes this a classy fanservice series.

Ultimately for a series that is primarily built to titilate with violence and fanservice Burst Angel does a fantastic job of giving meaning and depth to the characters.  You will never see that full 180 degree character development, at the end of the show Meg, Sei, Amy, and Jo will remain essentially the same but you will understand what has brought them to the point in your life you witness.  The show does leave a lot open at the end, but closes itself off nicely.  The art is always well done, there aren't any episodes or points in the series where you're going to run into badly drawn cells or sudden changes of style.  The music fits the show perfectly, from very cowboy-western to futuristic there was a lot of thought in the pairings.  Overall Burst Angel is fantastic for what it is trying to do, but it isn't the best of all time.  It has great replay value on a lazy weekend afternoon or as before bed fare even if you've watch the whole show several times.

It's a solid four star series, the only thing that would have made it a five is if it had been more plot heavy - but that may have completely destroyed what makes it such a fun and entertaining piece of anime.",1281225600,5,4757,4.597633136094674

It's actually not as violent as you might expect and the characters really depend on eachother. Jo the main herione while cold to some still has a tight nit bond with Meg.

3158080,3,B0016KV7W8,"Let me start this review by expressing my absolute adulation for Funimation's Viridian Collections.  I was first introduced to these extraordinary anime packs through Blue Gender and made it my priority to attempt to locate as many others as possible.  For those who don't know, Viridian Collections, in Funimation's own words are the essential titles for any well-rounded DVD collection exploring the pop culture phenomenon known as Japanese animation.  To you and I it means a box set containing an entire series, an OVA, and a lot of extras all for the price usually associated with a single season of a given show.

The extras contained within this Viridian Collection could easily fill up my entire critique so I'll mention a few of the key areas of interest briefly.  The set contains a whopping 6 episode commentary tracks with many of the English vocal talents and production, all of the original radio dramas, a Japanese cast interview, CGI artist interview, character designer interview, trailers, alternate opening and closing themes, battle records, textless songs, outtakes, and a Funimation trailer section on each and every disc.  If all that weren't enough, each disc contains a full episode of the bizarre but strangely addictive Funimation property Mr. Stain on Junk Alley.  For those of you who have no idea what this is (and that included me before this set), imagine a fully CG rendered show that would fit in pretty well with what we Americans might expect from Pixar, in which a presumably homeless (and shoeless) man, his sweater-wearing cat, and iguana on a leash spend each episode digging through the discarded junk in an alleyway for survival and ensuing high jinks.  Sound strange? Oh it is.  Take for example the one episode where he finds a pack of crayons that when colored with affect reality or another where starvation begins to tempt him into turning his pet lizard into a meal.  In the end you'll certainly wonder whether drug use played a part in the show's creation but yet somehow it succeeds on nearly every level (and all this without a single word of dialog ever spoken).

But enough about Mr. Stain, we're here to talk about Burst Angel right?  Language options are standard fair sub and dub which of course means dialog presented in either original Japanese or English dub each in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround.  And, like always, the choice to run English subtitles exists for either spoken language option.

The show could best be described as a mix of about a hundred different sociological elements, not the least of which is the spaghetti western theme that you may have gathered from the trailers and box art.  Although to be completely honest, except for a few chaps and six-shooter toting women and a giant robot that looks like he's sporting a cowboy hat atop his massive metal head, there really isn't much to remind the viewer of the old west.  In fact, the show starts things rolling with perhaps the oddest group of protagonists ever assembled and slaps them waist-deep into a conflict with underground crime syndicates, a corrupt government, and just a dash of sci-fi intrigue (like hideous beasts with glowing-brains that exit the skull and attempt to crawl away once the monster is defeated).

Sometimes the formula works, other times not so much.  When the show opens the viewer will more than likely fumble through the ensemble not exactly sure what to expect.  You know- like is this character important to the overall prose or what about this one here? By the end I can't say with certainty that the odd dynamic of the good guys ever falls into place.  You have many near-naked women to work with; one who takes charge of the group, another young girl who happens to be a computer genius, a bouncy (yet perky) redhead with a knack for getting into trouble, and a red-eyed, silver haired, purple tattooed killing machine who makes it her personal mission to bail the redhead out of trouble in nearly every episode.

There are a few males to speak of, mainly in the form of the giant robot's hairy mechanic (way too much exposed body presented in the ""beach"" episode) and a wussy pastry chef-in-training that is brought on to cook for the girls.  I suppose part of my own bewilderment comes from the fact that I expected the young cook to play a much bigger role in the grander story arc than he actually does by the end.  The first twelve episodes use him as a major focal point of the story then suddenly he gets dropped off like a bad step-kid at the soccer field.

I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell you that this is the bizarre story of Meg and Jo (the redhead and killing machine I told you about earlier) and their meteoric rise to mercenary status with a strange, dare I say lesbian love for one another.  Perhaps if I had known this going into the program, I would have been less distracted by the frivolous characters and jutting story threads that go nowhere throughout.  The OVA makes this reality especially clear although since it represents the very end of the show, by then its too late.

The English dub takes us back to 2005; an era where Funimation was improving in leaps and bounds but still wasn't quite the well-oiled machine that it has since become.  The commentary tracks are virtually useless at shedding any sort of light on the production process or the behind-the-scenes data that fans may expect from a commentary.  However, it's almost impossible not to find the bubbly personalities of the female voice actresses both infectious and personable.  Regardless of how happy you are with your current lot in life, these tracks will make you wonder if voice acting shouldn't have been your calling- even if you had to pay to do it!

In rare form, the majority of Texas-dwelling voice stars that make up Funimation were given an opportunity to let fly their southern accents in a segment that takes place entirely in Osaka (as opposed to Tokyo).  Since the original Japanese dialog wipes this correlation out entirely, I personally found it interesting that Osaka would be considered the old west of Japan.  Sure it's a gimmick and it may have been taken a bit too far, the fact is that this segment acts as a well-needed bridge between the two bigger story sections that are being developed here.

The Japanese acting, as is often the case, is more dramatic and emotional but lacking in the small inflections that hint toward ethnic-authenticity that the English track nails down.

In all Burst Angel is a very unique take on the mecha category of anime.  The visuals are pure Gonzo magic; especially the robot battles themselves.  The animation is both fluid and life-like with uncanny attention to detail.  However, the story is quite inconsistent in its delivery.  At times you'll be convinced that this is in fact a cleverly disguised comedy show only to reconsider it as a horror wannabe an episode later.  It picks and chooses elements at will which would have been fine had it committed to a single theme beneath the variations.  However, as it stands the end result feels muddled and a bit convoluted.  This is a tale that banks nearly everything on the viewer's undying adoration for the lead characters and to be honest, I never felt much toward them.

I should often point out that observant viewers may notice a couple of scenes that appear to have been taken almost directly from the 1997 American film Alien Resurrection.  I was hoping the creative staff would have commented on this observation in the extras but alas, no mention of it was ever made.

In conclusion this is a 3-star show from Gonzo but a 5-star product from Funimation.  Packaging, extras, and value are absolutely through the roof.  That's two for two on the Viridian Collections thus far but who's counting?",1246838400,7,7777,4.778026905829597
3158081,4,B0016KV7W8,"If you love anime and don't want care or need any of the fancy boxes, or collectibles that come with the other box sets then this is a great buy. You get all the episodes but you do lose out on all the extra features that some other boxsets offer.",1238025600,,247,3.96
3158082,4,B0016KV7W8,"The main story is vague and very predictable. All of us, who has watched more than ten series, can easily guess who is Jo and her ties to baddies after a few episodes. It's not necessarily bad, but I would've enjoyed the series more if there were couple of twists here and there.

Moving on, some of the cast doesn't make any sense, because they don't contribute anything to the continuation of the story. After the show I asked my self questions like ""Is he really necessary, why is she in the team"" and ""Why is he NOT in the team?"". And about the team, I haven't seen the members of the team do a single job as a team, it's always Jo. Interaction between characters are irrational and unreasonable.

On the other hand, animation is very nice.  I was amazed by the opening scene.  Good usage of CGI.  All Mech titles should adopt this technique, looks nice. Regular cells also look good, lots of color and detail in the background, makes the scene believable.

There is some fan service but not over the top, well, except maybe Sei's top, or her bathing suit. Mmm, I wonder how it looks like in real life?

Overall, the series is not deep but the action looks good and fun.  There are quite a few anime cliches in it, yet, still I can recommend it, if you have nothing better to do.",1238025600,5,1283,4.338912133891213
3158083,5,B0016KV7W8,"I caught Burst Angel on the Funimation channel. From beginning to end this is really a fun anime to watch. There are a lot of over the top characters in the series, but they are meant to be over the top. The plot itself is interesting, but as with any action based anything don't expect to be too deep. This is more about girls with big guns and even bigger breast... well... except for Jo the A-cup main character. The story is pretty much based around the life and times of Jo a hard headed take no stuff from anyone type of chick that PMS's 365 days a year. She travels with her lover... er I mean friend Meg, and the get into tons of trouble. Luckily the have the wits of Sai (who is obviously the leader because she has the biggest bust so she has to be), and Amy an underadged girl who thank goodness they were tasteful enough to draw clothes for. The 4 girls out to uncover a secret evil coorporation and do something or another after that, it's really unclear (I'm not joking). Any how each episode is filled with lots of action and the animation looks great! My favorite character is Maria Jo's Nemisis. She has much potential, but it ends to soon. Matter of fact the biggest downside to Burst Angel is that it's too short. Almost shorter than Megs skirt. It just ends abruptly and doesn't answer any questions. It leaves some room for a new season, but so far none have been introduced. For the most part Burst Angel is a great Action Anime in the same way Die hard was a great action movie, but just like a hollywood Action film, don't expect much of a detailed story line.
It's worth buying. I highly reccomend it!",1236816000,,1626,4.316993464052287

The basic plot (if you can even say it has one) is really just an excuse to show too much fan service, mech battles (totally uninteresting btw), and gun fights that make no sense.  My fav character wasn't even a main character, which just goes to show how much they developed the lead characters.  Anyway, this series was a big let-down, and I would only recommend getting it if you're into fan service (which I'm sure most of you are, lol).",1229385600,2,701,4.75206611570248

Overall Burst Angel is fantastic for what it is trying to do, but it isn't the best of all time.  It has great replay value on a lazy weekend afternoon or as before bed fare even if you've watch the whole show several times.

It's a solid four star series, the only thing that would have made it a five is if it had been more plot heavy - but that may have completely destroyed what makes it such a fun and entertaining piece of anime.",1281225600,5,4757,4.597633136094674

It's actually not as violent as you might expect and the characters really depend on eachother. Jo the main herione while cold to some still has a tight nit bond with Meg. They have been together since the begining. Unfortunatly I don't want to go into too much detail, but I do recommend the series.

3392577,3,B0016KV7W8,"Let me start this review by expressing my absolute adulation for Funimation's Viridian Collections.  I was first introduced to these extraordinary anime packs through Blue Gender and made it my priority to attempt to locate as many others as possible.  For those who don't know, Viridian Collections, in Funimation's own words are the essential titles for any well-rounded DVD collection exploring the pop culture phenomenon known as Japanese animation.  To you and I it means a box set containing an entire series, an OVA, and a lot of extras all for the price usually associated with a single season of a given show.

The extras contained within this Viridian Collection could easily fill up my entire critique so I'll mention a few of the key areas of interest briefly.  The set contains a whopping 6 episode commentary tracks with many of the English vocal talents and production, all of the original radio dramas, a Japanese cast interview, CGI artist interview, character designer interview, trailers, alternate opening and closing themes, battle records, textless songs, outtakes, and a Funimation trailer section on each and every disc.  If all that weren't enough, each disc contains a full episode of the bizarre but strangely addictive Funimation property Mr. Stain on Junk Alley.  For those of you who have no idea what this is (and that included me before this set), imagine a fully CG rendered show that would fit in pretty well with what we Americans might expect from Pixar, in which a presumably homeless (and shoeless) man, his sweater-wearing cat, and iguana on a leash spend each episode digging through the discarded junk in an alleyway for survival and ensuing high jinks.  Sound strange? Oh it is.  Take for example the one episode where he finds a pack of crayons that when colored with affect reality or another where starvation begins to tempt him into turning his pet lizard into a meal.  In the end you'll certainly wonder whether drug use played a part in the show's creation but yet somehow it succeeds on nearly every level (and all this without a single word of dialog ever spoken).

But enough about Mr. Stain, we're here to talk about Burst Angel right?  Language options are standard fair sub and dub which of course means dialog presented in either original Japanese or English dub each in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround.  And, like always, the choice to run English subtitles exists for either spoken language option.

The show could best be described as a mix of about a hundred different sociological elements, not the least of which is the spaghetti western theme that you may have gathered from the trailers and box art.  Although to be completely honest, except for a few chaps and six-shooter toting women and a giant robot that looks like he's sporting a cowboy hat atop his massive metal head, there really isn't much to remind the viewer of the old west.  In fact, the show starts things rolling with perhaps the oddest group of protagonists ever assembled and slaps them waist-deep into a conflict with underground crime syndicates, a corrupt government, and just a dash of sci-fi intrigue (like hideous beasts with glowing-brains that exit the skull and attempt to crawl away once the monster is defeated).

Sometimes the formula works, other times not so much.  When the show opens the viewer will more than likely fumble through the ensemble not exactly sure what to expect.  You know- like is this character important to the overall prose or what about this one here? By the end I can't say with certainty that the odd dynamic of the good guys ever falls into place.  You have many near-naked women to work with; one who takes charge of the group, another young girl who happens to be a computer genius, a bouncy (yet perky) redhead with a knack for getting into trouble, and a red-eyed, silver haired, purple tattooed killing machine who makes it her personal mission to bail the redhead out of trouble in nearly every episode.

There are a few males to speak of, mainly in the form of the giant robot's hairy mechanic (way too much exposed body presented in the ""beach"" episode) and a wussy pastry chef-in-training that is brought on to cook for the girls.  I suppose part of my own bewilderment comes from the fact that I expected the young cook to play a much bigger role in the grander story arc than he actually does by the end.  The first twelve episodes use him as a major focal point of the story then suddenly he gets dropped off like a bad step-kid at the soccer field.

I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell you that this is the bizarre story of Meg and Jo (the redhead and killing machine I told you about earlier) and their meteoric rise to mercenary status with a strange, dare I say lesbian love for one another.  Perhaps if I had known this going into the program, I would have been less distracted by the frivolous characters and jutting story threads that go nowhere throughout.  The OVA makes this reality especially clear although since it represents the very end of the show, by then its too late.

The English dub takes us back to 2005; an era where Funimation was improving in leaps and bounds but still wasn't quite the well-oiled machine that it has since become.  The commentary tracks are virtually useless at shedding any sort of light on the production process or the behind-the-scenes data that fans may expect from a commentary.  However, it's almost impossible not to find the bubbly personalities of the female voice actresses both infectious and personable.  Regardless of how happy you are with your current lot in life, these tracks will make you wonder if voice acting shouldn't have been your calling- even if you had to pay to do it!

In rare form, the majority of Texas-dwelling voice stars that make up Funimation were given an opportunity to let fly their southern accents in a segment that takes place entirely in Osaka (as opposed to Tokyo).  Since the original Japanese dialog wipes this correlation out entirely, I personally found it interesting that Osaka would be considered the old west of Japan.  Sure it's a gimmick and it may have been taken a bit too far, the fact is that this segment acts as a well-needed bridge between the two bigger story sections that are being developed here.

The Japanese acting, as is often the case, is more dramatic and emotional but lacking in the small inflections that hint toward ethnic-authenticity that the English track nails down.

In all Burst Angel is a very unique take on the mecha category of anime.  The visuals are pure Gonzo magic; especially the robot battles themselves.  The animation is both fluid and life-like with uncanny attention to detail.  However, the story is quite inconsistent in its delivery.  At times you'll be convinced that this is in fact a cleverly disguised comedy show only to reconsider it as a horror wannabe an episode later.  It picks and chooses elements at will which would have been fine had it committed to a single theme beneath the variations.  However, as it stands the end result feels muddled and a bit convoluted.  This is a tale that banks nearly everything on the viewer's undying adoration for the lead characters and to be honest, I never felt much toward them.

I should often point out that observant viewers may notice a couple of scenes that appear to have been taken almost directly from the 1997 American film Alien Resurrection.  I was hoping the creative staff would have commented on this observation in the extras but alas, no mention of it was ever made.

In conclusion this is a 3-star show from Gonzo but a 5-star product from Funimation.  Packaging, extras, and value are absolutely through the roof.  That's two for two on the Viridian Collections thus far but who's counting?",1246838400,7,7777,4.778026905829597
3392578,4,B0016KV7W8,"If you love anime and don't want care or need any of the fancy boxes, or collectibles that come with the other box sets then this is a great buy. You get all the episodes but you do lose out on all the extra features that some other boxsets offer.",1238025600,,247,3.96
3392579,4,B0016KV7W8,"The main story is vague and very predictable. All of us, who has watched more than ten series, can easily guess who is Jo and her ties to baddies after a few episodes. It's not necessarily bad, but I would've enjoyed the series more if there were couple of twists here and there.

Moving on, some of the cast doesn't make any sense, because they don't contribute anything to the continuation of the story. After the show I asked my self questions like ""Is he really necessary, why is she in the team"" and ""Why is he NOT in the team?"". And about the team, I haven't seen the members of the team do a single job as a team, it's always Jo. Interaction between characters are irrational and unreasonable.

On the other hand, animation is very nice.  I was amazed by the opening scene.  Good usage of CGI.  All Mech titles should adopt this technique, looks nice. Regular cells also look good, lots of color and detail in the background, makes the scene believable.

There is some fan service but not over the top, well, except maybe Sei's top, or her bathing suit. Mmm, I wonder how it looks like in real life?

Overall, the series is not deep but the action looks good and fun.  There are quite a few anime cliches in it, yet, still I can recommend it, if you have nothing better to do.",1238025600,5,1283,4.338912133891213
3392580,5,B0016KV7W8,"I caught Burst Angel on the Funimation channel. From beginning to end this is really a fun anime to watch. There are a lot of over the top characters in the series, but they are meant to be over the top. The plot itself is interesting, but as with any action based anything don't expect to be too deep. This is more about girls with big guns and even bigger breast... well... except for Jo the A-cup main character. The story is pretty much based around the life and times of Jo a hard headed take no stuff from anyone type of chick that PMS's 365 days a year. She travels with her lover... er I mean friend Meg, and the get into tons of trouble. Luckily the have the wits of Sai (who is obviously the leader because she has the biggest bust so she has to be), and Amy an underadged girl who thank goodness they were tasteful enough to draw clothes for. The 4 girls out to uncover a secret evil coorporation and do something or another after that, it's really unclear (I'm not joking). Any how each episode is filled with lots of action and the animation looks great! My favorite character is Maria Jo's Nemisis. She has much potential, but it ends to soon. Matter of fact the biggest downside to Burst Angel is that it's too short. Almost shorter than Megs skirt. It just ends abruptly and doesn't answer any questions. It leaves some room for a new season, but so far none have been introduced. For the most part Burst Angel is a great Action Anime in the same way Die hard was a great action movie, but just like a hollywood Action film, don't expect much of a detailed story line.
It's worth buying. I highly reccomend it!",1236816000,,1626,4.316993464052287
3392581,1,B0016KV7W8,"Burst Angel has absolutely no point.  The animation seemed terrible, especially for a Gonzo show.  Frankly, I was very disappointed in this show, especially after all the build-up expecting another amazing Gonzo series.  But, sadly, Gonzo really let me down.  The basic plot (if you can even say it has one) is really just an excuse to show too much fan service, mech battles (totally uninteresting btw), and gun fights that make no sense.  My fav character wasn't even a main character, which just goes to show how much they developed the lead characters.  Anyway, this series was a big let-down, and I would only recommend getting it if you're into fan service (which I'm sure most of you are, lol).",1229385600,2,701,4.75206611570248

8262984,3,B0016KV7W8,"The basic idea is this review is the lack of coherent plot. From episode after episode there's a lot of jumping from one thing to another so there is absolutetly no character development.

There is a simple rule one can follow in each episode: if a new character appears you will a)never see him/ her / it again., b) same as a), c) same as b). Villain, ally or neutral it does not matter, they simply fill a void in a particular episode and that's it. They're gone.

One reviewer mentioned that Megan keeps getting kidnaped. It's true and it's frustrating.

Picture quality is Ok and fanservice is not as exageated as some reviewers stated before. Not much here to sand out.

Sound quality is also ok. Not much there either.

I can honestly said that I was disappointed  with this series. I think that at 24 episodes it waaayyy long. Especially if, like in my case, by the 7th episode you really don't care.
