8218970,5,B000VIU0NI,They came in SUCH great condition! I couldn't be any happier. Especially for such a great price!,1502323200,,96,4.705882352941177
8218971,5,B000VIU0NI,Incredibly good deal. Artwork was a nice touch.,1501027200,,47,5.0
8218972,4,B000VIU0NI,"This  series started out great,but when Season 2 came out, it went down hill fast. I'm not sure why it didn't succeed, it had all the right menu items for a great sc-fi/action series. However, this first season is great and it only cost a little over $4.00 to buy. How can
you not jump on this deal. Ordinary people suddenly develop super powers and one of them is killing off the others and absorbing their powers. Great cast, great idea, great show. At least for the first season. Too bad the Heroes couldn't save the rest of the shows.",1417478400,,538,4.38
8218973,5,B000VIU0NI,I love the season one. when i first watched it i was on my toes the whole time its a must see. oh and delivery was great.,1377561600,,121,3.5185185185185186
8218974,5,B000VIU0NI,!st was the best!  The packaging for this set was nice.  The mini prints were a nice addition.  Packaging for the second season was better!,1370822400,,139,4.48
8218975,5,B000VIU0NI,"If you enjoy the suspense of a drama, the humor of comedies, and the shear action and thrill of adventure, Heroes has a mix of all. A comic book fan myself, skeptical thoughts riddled my mind when first watching this series, but later came to love the series and it's characters. Highly recommended.",1368489600,,299,4.660377358490566
8218976,3,B000VIU0NI,"Unless you are a die-hard Heroes fan, the exclusive stuff isn't really worth it. Just get the normal season 1 set- it's cheaper!",1357171200,,128,4.608695652173913
8218977,5,B000VIU0NI,"I loved this show and the DVD is not a disappointment in anyway! If you watched the series on TV and enjoy action, mystery, heroes, good vs evil and a twisty story line check this out. If you love shows loaded with special effects and a bit of sci-fi and romance then this is certainly a must own.",1296172800,,297,4.137931034482759
8218978,5,B000VIU0NI,One of my teenagers' favorite shows on television! My son was excited to open it on Christmas Day. The bonus disc and mini paintings were a real plus. He loved it and enjoyed watching the whole season on Christmas Day!,1232496000,,218,4.475
