4653603,2,B005CKIGTK,"It's a silly film involving an un-named (for most of the film) villain killing cooks, and hunting for ""the king of the chefs"". Which means it's almost exactly what you'd expect.",1391385600,,177,4.741935483870968

4653608,3,B005CKIGTK,"Ok Kungfu flick .But definitely not among the best. Fights were ok , movie print quality was mediocre. Movie story line is not upto the mark and it has usual fare of action revenge. A no good hero practices some more kunfu and kills bad guy.
If you have hour and more to time to kill and bored to death go ahead and pick this movie.",1360368000,,332,4.045454545454546

8465573,2,B005CKIGTK,I didn't care for this movie. I just skim thru it.  Ok kung fu flicks but not with Jackie Chan.  The humor is cheesy and the English dubbing is terrible. I would've watch the whole movie if it was in the original audio recording. There are other good old kung fu movies to watch....I would skip this one.,1420070400,,304,4.224137931034483
