8203462,4,B000RZIH30,"Kent James, alias Nick Normal, is documented here as a performer who lacked control on stage, thus the group had a lot of trouble getting bookings. No full songs are featured in this video, unfortunately, but it provides a taste of the outrageous, punk-like wild man music as well as the acoustic, insightful music by the same musicians. Personally, I like both the punk and the sensitive, thoughtful acoustic songs, but to get the full songs, you have to order the collection of 10 years' of music by Kent James. Nick is openly gay and has a temper that often turned him into a wild man who screamed insults at the audience. In interviews with Nick/Kent and those around him, they all admit this was a problem but offer little explanation for it. He would even scream at the ""little sissies"" in the audience for not acting like masculine gay men. Obviously, very little of this went over well with the audience before they walked out or the plug was pulled on the music. Nick/Kent introduces his lover who is a butch body builder like himself; they appear to really love each other, which is great. Nick's got a really good voice and writes some great songs, so if he ever decides to go back to making music and performing, he just needs to maintain control. I enjoy his the collection CD, but I probably wouldn't have purchased it without seeing this documentary first since, without a larger view of Nick, he can easily be portrayed as just a loud-mouthed wanna-be. He's more than that by far. I'd really like to see Kent do more music, especially songs along the line of the sensitive, deeply-felt songs, some of which are actually quite beautiful. I am glad Kent lives in San Francisco as I do too. Without the Mohawk, I probably wouldn't recognize him on the street, but if I did, I'd encourage him to make more records.",1406937600,,1826,4.587155963302752
