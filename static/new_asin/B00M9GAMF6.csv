6565185,5,B00M9GAMF6,"Dang good movies.  Really makes you think who's watching you. Good and evil.  Now I know who is putting those bad ideas in my mind about people or things to do.  Now I know I can turn away cause the ideas are not coming from me.  Well, the only way you will understand what I mean is to order this DVD.  It is really really good.",1470441600,4,329,3.9242424242424243
6565186,1,B00M9GAMF6,"A Christian movie????????? Pardon me for screaming, but THIS IS A BLATANT BOLD FACE LIE!!!!!!! THIS IS A 100% SATANIC TRILOGY OF FILMS. THERE IS NOT EVEN 1 MENTION OF JESUS/GOD.  ANGELS ARE ALL DEMONS AND POWERLESS IN THIS MOVIE AND EVIL EVEN WINS SOME OF THE BATTLES AGAINST 'ANGELS'. WOW! THIS WAS A VERY DISTURBING EXPERIENCE. NONE OF THIS IS GODLY AND I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS CLASSIFIED AS CHRISTIAN. SHAME ON THEM AND MAY TRUE SALVATUON, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST, BE FOUND BY ALL INVOLVED WITH THIS NIGHTMARE OF DEMONIC MOVIES.

6565193,5,B00M9GAMF6,"Divination is a must see movie.  We showed this movie at one of our bible study sessions and it kept us on our toes.  It's an excellent depiction of what is happening daily in the spiritual realm all around us.  It makes you think too.  I'm surprised that I did not hear of it until this year.  After I saw it at church, I had to have my very own copy.  I love this copy because you can get three movies for the price of one.  I have not personally had the opportunity to view Charge Over You or New World Order, but several of my friends said they were Good Too.  Purchase this DVD and I promise you will not regret it.",1414627200,16,620,3.983739837398374

6565207,5,B00M9GAMF6,"The religious individuals who watch the end times trilogy may complain there is nothing Biblical about it. The spiritual Christian, however, will enjoy these movies and understand the truth that lie hidden within. Jesus told us that not everything would be found witan the Bible when he said not to worry about what we were to say because the Holy Spirit would teach us in that hour. If the Holy Spirit will teach us in that hour what we need to know or say, then obviously we do not already know the answer.

 A person with profound knowledge of the Bible will have an answer from the Bible alone, where as a person who is receiving wisdom from the Holy Sprint will be taught at the moment what he or she needs to know or say. The Pharisees hated Jesus because he was teaching things that were not in the Bible, but what, instead, teaching what he received from the Holy Spirit. Religious Christians are not prepared for what lies ahead. Jesus was spiritual, not religious. We are fighting a spiritual war, not promoting religious crusade.

The End Times Trilogy is only confirming many truths that we where warned about in the Bible while giving us a glimpse of how Babylon The Great/Paganism/Hollywood/New World Order is using it's influence to promote its doctrines and practices (divination, etc.) to the general public..",1494115200,,1326,4.731601731601732

6565219,1,B00M9GAMF6,"Don't waste your hard earned cash on this!  These are some of the worst movies I ever watched in my life! Poorly acted, poorly produced, poorly everything.  Not inspiring, not uplifting, no true spiritual message, and if there was an attempt at pointing out the dangers of messing around with the dark side, boy!, just good for laughs!  Just like the cheapest, lowest budget class B movies of yore.",1488412800,,398,4.739130434782608
6565220,5,B00M9GAMF6,Scriptures tell of the angel armies that are encamped around those who love God.  We are to test these spirits to those of good or evil.

6565235,3,B00M9GAMF6,I was disappointed in this trilogy. I was expecting something more. I wanted to watch these movies and be able to say they were wonderful as well as a mirror of what is happening around us today. The acting was not done well in many places and the quality of the films were like you would see in the middle of the night on TV. I wanted to like this but not this time.,1475452800,3,367,3.972972972972973
6565236,3,B00M9GAMF6,"So I purchased these three movies and to my surprise, one of the movies was missing, and it just happens to be the one I wanted to see the most. The End Times Trilogy was missing one of it's thrillers, Divination, I do like to watch the end times and apocalyptic movies  and was looking forward to seeing this one. I refused to watch any of the other movies on the tape and sent it back that same day. I am sure this was just some weird glitch that had happened and I was that once in a 1000 person that got the bad batch. Normally, when I purchase from Amazon, I get the best quality of the things that I order, this was just one of those times that I didn't.",1474934400,,660,4.0

There was a stronger focus on the demonic realm with all 3 of these movies (Ouji boards, satantic incantations, blood sacrifice, etc.  Additionally, there was partial nudity and sexual suggestion, which was  not necessary to communicate the intent.

The Lord's name is taken in vain many times throughout, ""what the He**"" was used numerous times as was, ""Go to He**"". There was NO doctrine, total fiction, didn't make any sense as to how they could even say they received any of this from the Bible and satan is a woman!  Just wanted to help others not make the same mistake we did.  We are doing our best to return it as we don't want it as part of our video library.  Buyer BEWARE!",1510704000,12,710,4.366412213740458
