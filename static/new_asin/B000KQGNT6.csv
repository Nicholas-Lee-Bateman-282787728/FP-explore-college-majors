8158758,2,B000KQGNT6,My wife and I had been to Maui for 10 days 2 summers ago. I was expecting to see some of the beautiful scenery we had encountered on the Road to Hanna and the western part of the Island. What we saw was half a dozen low resolution video stills of a beach and a waterfall and not even the prettiest areas at that. I am not sure what the point of the film was. I guess if I was just listening to the wind and water without the video I might have been able to go to sleep.,1363046400,,469,3.7474747474747474

The cons: There are so many beautiful places on Maui. Why not show more of them? Why repeat the same shot, instead of shooting something new? Hey, it's not a small island, it's even biger than Oahu. What kept you from driving around the island and taking more shots? Gas prices too high?

Also, a video like this could gain a lot from a high definition format.
My conclusion: it's a decent video DVD with a few beautiful vistas of Maui. But you could do a better video on your own, especially if using one of those HD cameras, which are getting more and more affordable nowadays.",1231632000,,665,4.3983739837398375
