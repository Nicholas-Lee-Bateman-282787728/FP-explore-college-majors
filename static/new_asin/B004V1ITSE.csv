4478848,5,B004V1ITSE,"I was blown away when I saw this film here in Santa Fe, NM late last year. I love foreign films, but didn't know anything about this particular film. It is mindblowing to see people like Mr. Savitsky to live such a dedicated life against all odds. Where would these many thousand of artpieces be without him.......they probably wouldn't excist anymore. Thank you so very much Mr. Savitsky and thank you to the wonderful people who made this film possible to share the story with the world.",1307836800,,489,4.632183908045977
4478849,5,B004V1ITSE,"Generally, my favorite movies pertain to history, documentary, music, science, character-study, and politics.  I had no idea of what this film was until Keneth Turan reviewed it in The L. A. Times.  I am not very knowledgeable about art, but he raved about it.  I asked my wife to join me, and she declined.  That was the first time I went to see a film alone (68 years.)  It was staggering, heart-warming, intriguing and unique.  AND it included history, documentary, science, character-study and politics.  Extremely unusual to find a movie with all of those connections.  I came home and told my wife that she missed one of the best movies I had seen in ten years.  She was very sorry that she missed it, but she was lucky that it was shown on PBS (?) a few weeks later, although ten minutes had been cut.  And all movies should be seen in a theater, not on TV.  In particular, when the subject is art, one should see the movie with the color and size intact.  My wife prefers to see a movie pretty fairly back.  Here, I saw the movie in the fourth row.  Even more breath-taking when one sees the detail and majesty of the art.  Finally, I am a cognitive-behavioral therapist, and one of my specialties is treating patients who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder.  The best movie-makers, scientists, architects, chefs, musicians and artists have these qualities.  Hopefully such persons don't have the behavioral characteristics that are extreme.  Kazinsky was an artist and a remarkable hoarder, and the world was very lucky to have him.",1305331200,,1548,4.7556390977443606
4478850,5,B004V1ITSE,"I visited the Savitsky collection last April and was so blown away by the story of the museum and its art. I finally watched the film last night, and I can't express how overjoyed and relieved I am that someone has captured the beauty and surrealness of the museum. To have the story of this collection be lost would be such a tragedy.",1304812800,,335,4.333333333333333
4478851,5,B004V1ITSE,"I saw this film at the Denver Starz Film Festival and I was absolutely blown away.  Awesome story, very well told.  If you love history and character driven stories you will not be disappointed.",1304812800,2,194,4.676470588235294
4478852,5,B004V1ITSE,"We love this movie! It is smart and provocative and beautifully made. And the most interesting part for any artist is to think about the ""what if"" of it all. What if you lived in a time that you could be killed just for creating your art? It's just heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time to think the art in this film could have been lost forever but somehow has been preserved. BRAVO to the filmmakers and thanks for making such an important movie.",1304726400,4,462,4.383720930232558
4478873,5,B004V1ITSE,great inspiration and story!,1445558400,,28,6.25
4478874,5,B004V1ITSE,"Great movie not just because of the art, but because of the perseverance.",1444176000,,73,4.6923076923076925
4478875,4,B004V1ITSE,"Interesting, involving, enlightening. Learn something about art you never knew existed. Art as good as any you'll find anywhere. And artists who suffered as much, if not more, for their work than their much more famous contemporaries.",1432857600,3,234,5.351351351351352
4478876,5,B004V1ITSE,"For artists and art historians, this is a most worthy film.  Essentially, one man at great personal peril saved 43,000 works.  That fact makes each of the works priceless.  By all means, watch this one.  Thank you.",1427760000,2,214,4.702702702702703
4478877,5,B004V1ITSE,A  good title and story of the endurance of precious art and artifacts. Fascinating bit of history.,1426204800,,99,4.823529411764706
4478878,1,B004V1ITSE,You would need to be an art critic to appreciate this.,1424476800,,54,4.0
4478879,3,B004V1ITSE,"Interesting, educational",1420675200,,24,11.5
4478880,5,B004V1ITSE,This is an awesome film.  I purchased it after seeing it at a museum.  The story and the quantities of paintings that are shown are lovely and inspiring.,1419724800,2,153,4.428571428571429
4478881,5,B004V1ITSE,"A story of survival and perseverance in the face of dangerous political barriers. Exactly how the central character survives oppression, other than establishing the museum in an extremely remote area, is not clear. Happily for Art's sake he saves masterpieces.",1418860800,4,260,5.525
4478882,4,B004V1ITSE,"Very interesting and surprising story of one man's effort save the work of important Russian artists who's work was suppressed (and they too often sent to the Gulag) during the Stalin era. Equally surprising, if not amazing, is that this art is stored and displayed in Uzbekistan.",1418688000,3,280,4.9787234042553195
4478893,5,B004V1ITSE,"The DVD was fascinating. It reminded me of how important freedom of expression is. The art historians shown in this DVD should get medals for bravery in managing to evade the KGB. It was interesting to me that the art historians could recognize genius when they saw it. Possibly even before the artist believed his own genius.
Thanks

4478894,5,B004V1ITSE,"Absolutely mesmerizing!  To think that Savitsky was able to put this collection together throughout the Stalin purges, and continue until his dying day is unbelievable!  I know that I will have a hard time getting to sleep tonight, wondering what has happened to the  collection.  I pray that they have been able to receive funding to keep it together and start restoration work on the myriad of canvasses they were able to save (40,000 plus!).  To see them go into a private collection would be heart breaking...
Does any of the money of the sale of the video go to the museum?  I will gladly buy a copy if that is the case.  Spread the word to all your art - loving friends about this video.  They will not regret it!",1415577600,3,719,4.435114503816794
4478895,5,B004V1ITSE,"Highly recommend this film, it shows the love of a man for art and people.",1415059200,2,74,4.0
4478896,5,B004V1ITSE,"Amazing and unknown story of a driven man single handedly dodging Soviet politics to start a museum, which they would have disapproved, on their dime.",1414972800,2,150,5.04
4478897,5,B004V1ITSE,Fascinating film and beautifully done. This is a story that needs to be told.,1414886400,,77,4.571428571428571
4478898,4,B004V1ITSE,I WAS NOT AWARE OF THESE HIDDEN TREASURES!!! KEEP SPREADING THE WORD.,1414108800,2,69,4.833333333333333
4478899,4,B004V1ITSE,"This movie is a fascinating documentary regarding the development of collections of ethnographic materials and art in a far-off corner of Uzbekistan.  The collections of Igor Savitsky explored in the movie saved the works of many artists, repressed by Stalin and the Soviet government, from simply disappearing.  In addition the rich ethnographic collections of materials from the peoples of Karakalpakstan are described in the movie, as is the life of Igor Savitsky.  How funds were obtained to develop the museum to display some of these works is a fascinating story in its own right.

Recommended by a colleague, I watched the movie about a year ago and added a side trip to Nukus to a tour in Central Asia so I could visit the museum.  I was not disappointed.  Returning from the tour a couple of weeks ago, I decided to watch the movie again.  It reinforced my visit and helped me to better understand the enormity of the collection and its story.",1412899200,2,952,4.803680981595092
4478900,5,B004V1ITSE,"I have seen this doc at least four times over a period of two years.  It is simply astoundingly beautiful and remarkably interesting.  Finally it is full of fascinating info about the repression of the artists by the Soviets.  But more than anything else, because my chances of EVER GETTING  TO GO THERE  to see the works up close,  and because of their exquisite beauty and a rarely seen use of color....I just periodically treat myself to a """"Nukus Museum"" visit!!  I pull my easy chair close to our large screen, pour myself a cup of rose tea, sit back and play ""STOP MOTION""  with the remote! Every time one of the incredible canvases appears on the screen I simply stop and stare to my heart's delight!  It is so satisfying to be able to view these wonderful works at my leisure, for as long as I wish, and to go back and see some canvases again (and again!!) In some ways it seems as wonderful to me as visiting any world class art museum...and in the privacy on my own home with no museum guards poking around to make sure that I am ""not too close to the art work"" !!!  I love this film and view it as one of my favorite personal ""art dates"" that I can go on for total pleasure....for FREE!!!  Hurray for DVR and DVD collections!  Independent Lens showed this and I am SO GLAD THAT I RECORDED IT!!!!",1396224000,2,1306,4.285714285714286
4478901,5,B004V1ITSE,"What a wonderful Documentary I was so impressed!  Learned of the art world from another perspective.

I am very happy with this DVD.",1391472000,,132,4.695652173913044
4478902,5,B004V1ITSE,"This incredible documentary has the power to restore our faith in humankind.  What an unbelievable life journey one man undertook for the love of art and artists.  The story has become widely known, in no small part due to the screening on many PBS stations, so I won't repeated here. All I like to say is, that the story moved me deeply.  I have shared the DVD with others who told me the same. Highly recommend.",1365033600,2,413,4.407894736842105
4478903,5,B004V1ITSE,All was perfect. And anyone that hasn't seen it should add it to their library. I'ts amazing.  To know their are these museum pieces in the dessert is mind blowing.,1364169600,,164,4.466666666666667
4478904,5,B004V1ITSE,"I've shared this DVD with many friends. They share an interest in art and find this story of one man who overcame great barriers to preserve beautiful art work,inspiring.  The times are dangerous for the works and the man. It is a story to save these art works.  The struggle is not over since these pieces need a special environment to preserve them and many need repair and restoration.",1354752000,,388,4.608695652173913
4478905,5,B004V1ITSE,"A tale all the more compelling for being true. I encountered artists who should be known worldwide, but, because they created during Soviet times and in a remote part of the world, their art was suppressed and ignored. If not for the bravery and doggedness of one man and his dedicated successors, this splendid work and the museum which houses it would be lost.

The future of the museum remains precarious, which makes this film all the more moving.",1330473600,3,451,4.708860759493671
4478906,5,B004V1ITSE,"As a student of history, particularly World War II, I was aware that the Nazis confiscated certain works of art that they considered 'degenerate.'  Until I watched this film I had no idea that the same thing happened in the Soviet Union under Stalin.  This is a wonderful film that chronicles what happens to free thinkers and artists who don't tow the party line in repressive societies, while it showcases a large collection of nearly lost art.  The art world owes a great deal to Igor Savitsky, the man who saved this collection at great personal risk, and to the filmmakers for this beautiful tribute to him and the cultural masterpieces that he protected.",1319414400,5,660,4.771929824561403
4478907,5,B004V1ITSE,"This movie reveals a fantastic story of how even under the suppression of individualism in the soviet communist system, one man found a way to collect and save 40,000 of the finest controversial works of art by some of the greatest little-known artists who happened to live in the USSR. Highly recommend whether you're interested in art or the triumph of the human spirit.",1316995200,3,372,4.828125
4478908,5,B004V1ITSE,"This remarkable, memorable film moved me and educated me about a region and a history I knew little about. It is an essential addition to the history of twentieth century art. But for me, what was most important was the weaving of political, geographical, and cultural history. This integrated viewpoint allows me to see the complexity of that historical period and introduces me to a region that is lately more often in the news.",1313366400,3,430,4.824324324324325
4478909,5,B004V1ITSE,"True story of Igor Savitsky who helps art survive in a time of oppression.  During the Soviet era artists who did not conform to the standards of Soviet realism were sent to mental hospitals, gulags or even killed,  Savitsky rescues over 40,000 forbidden fellow artist's works and creates a museum in a remote area in Uzbekistan far from Moscow and the KGB.  He collects a mix of Russian avant garde art and a folk style unique to the area.  The art is incredible - unique style of European modernism with Islamic traditions.  I had never heard of Mr. Savitsky or the art but this is one documentary that is a must see for anyone interested in art - you will see paintings worth millions that are virtually unknown to most of the world.",1312070400,9,736,4.503759398496241
4478910,5,B004V1ITSE,"This compelling film hit so many of my interests.  I am, in fact, a passionate traveler who had been to Uzbekistan but never to this really remote part ... feels like I have to make another trip there.  I'm of Russian parentage and a bit of a history buff and what a great historical document this was and then there was this treasure trove of stunning art ... never before seen art that would have been forever lost but for one remarkable obsessed man who no one had ever heard about.  I LOVED this well told story and have now seen it three times ... it's a not to be missed movie!",1311638400,4,583,4.1875
4478911,5,B004V1ITSE,"This is a fantastic movie.  I not only learned so much but was inspired to research afterwards as my friends and I  excitedly shared many diverse questions and impressions immediately following our viewing.!!  ""Where can I see more of this art?;  What about the Soviet concentration camps?  Did you see how they destroyed the lake and it completely dried out?  This is just like how US decimated our Native culture? How did some private collectors get some of the art"" are a few that come to mind, months after the showing in a small college town in very rural south Dakota.  Fascinating history, amazingly just as relevant for today's world as when the art was created 70 yrs ago.  Working on so many levels it is a must see.",1307923200,9,726,4.573643410852713
4478912,5,B004V1ITSE,This is a must see if you are interested in Soviet Realism or impressionist and how revolutions impact on our world.,1307836800,2,116,4.571428571428571
8442518,5,B004V1ITSE,"This is a well formulated film. The producer has gathered research from Igor Savitsky, an art collector in Uzbekistan. The artists depicted were active during a period of time when they were considered suspect by the USSR. Their activities were suppressed. The creatively original nature of their work is shown in full with short biographies of the artists themselves.
I had borrowed this DVD and renewed it many times before realizing that I really needed to own it. So often artists by necessity of their nature produce compelling art for which public approbation does not occur until after their death.",1520121600,,605,5.06
8442519,5,B004V1ITSE,"I am deeply shaken by the story about this outstanding person, by the incredible beauty of the art he saved and returned to us all. He created a monument to all those tortured and destroyed artists who were annihilated by the Soviet regime.
It is a wonderfully uplifting example of what a single person can do even under impossible circumstance.",1492560000,,345,4.766666666666667
8442520,5,B004V1ITSE,Photography is magnificent; story is fascinating.,1484697600,,49,7.333333333333333
8442521,5,B004V1ITSE,Very touching film...incredible artwork and characters.  Will inspire further research on the subject matter.,1472947200,,109,6.785714285714286
8442522,4,B004V1ITSE,"Good flick about art, artists, collectors, and politics.",1472256000,,56,6.125

8442526,5,B004V1ITSE,"An amazing story of an individual making a giant contribution to humanity in the face of an oppressive regime.

The film is extremely well made and a truly captivating tale of how one man with a passion for art but not the gift for creating led an effort to save the art of a generation in the Stalinist Soviet Union in a hidden corner of the empire.",1454457600,2,350,4.223880597014926
8442527,5,B004V1ITSE,This DVD reveals an astonishing story that is worthwhile in its own right.  And then the art is fabulous.  Excellent.,1451952000,2,117,4.8
