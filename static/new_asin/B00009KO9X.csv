7991022,1,B00009KO9X,"My favorite show...but what's the deal with the price for this collection?  $144 for the first four seasons when you can get them individually for around $30 each.  Order them individually, get free shipping, save some money and it's still just as funny, even funnier if you take the money you save and put it toward the 5th seaon. Great show, stupid price.",1072742400,10,357,4.650793650793651
7991023,5,B00009KO9X,"Well, at the time of writing this the 5-pack may override this one.... anyway, this is the best way to get everything you saw on TV plus more!!! (some edited scenes, trivias and to be able to watch them many times from now).
If you like Friends you should get a way to acquire this stuff, if you haven't seen them, try them out, they can make you laugh in the worst day. They're simply the best",1066435200,,394,4.12987012987013
7991024,4,B00009KO9X,"I had to go out and buy this because I just heard about the show a couple of years ago, so I missed all of the old episodes.  After spending 2 days STRAIGHT watching all of these lost episodes in a row from start to finish, the show makes a little more sense to me now.  My favorite character on here is Joey as played by Matthew Perry.  He is so stupid he makes me laugh. (If you really want a laugh, check out his big-screen debut in the comedy classic ""ED"" about a baseball playing ape.  It is on my Top 5 of all-time Movie List).  David Swimmer is good as well, although I liked him better in the ""Single Guy"" and as the elephant's voice on ""Ice Age"".  Probably the highlight for me of this great collection is when Ross's sister is dating Thomas Magnum a.k.a Tom Selleck.  It turns out that Magnum is actually a friend of Ross's dad and is in New York visiting and... well I don't want to spoil the plot for you! I also like the Thanksgiving episode and the one where Feebee acts like a hippie.  You must get this collection if you want to make any sense at all out of seasons 6 through 12!  My sources tell me to get ready for a Saturday morning cartoon featuring the antics of the Friends gang when they were kids!!",1061424000,4,1222,4.122362869198312
7991025,5,B00009KO9X,"Friends is really a show that has been cast aside by those people who feel that watching it makes you uncool.  I feel sorry for those of you who have done this.
It may possibly be the funniest show of the 90's.  It rivals Seinfeld in many catagories.  I have already compared friends to the greatest sitcom in the history of television (by opinion of course) so what else do you need?
The episodes on these first four seasons carry many memories and unforgettable scenarios and all-out hilarity.  I realy can't believe that some people deny this show simply to stay cool.  Get over yourself and buy these DVD's.
You won't be disappointed.  It's simply not possible.  I have seen every episode at least 3 times and I still laugh at them every time.  You're not just purchasing a DVD, but soon to be ""classic television"" at a very good price and with many, many, many unforgettable moments.
Don't reject this show...you'll regret it.",1059523200,5,931,4.634146341463414
7991026,5,B00009KO9X,"If you feel like you can never have enough of 'FRIENDS'...no matter how many re-runs they have, then this DVD collection is for you. Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer are at their very best! 'Friends' (with their 44 Emmy Award nominations) is beautifully played by the six very close knit friends who make you laugh and have one helluva time as their daily lives unfold before your eyes. This DVD set is bound to be a jewel in your DVD collection. Two thumbs way up!",1058227200,2,535,4.702127659574468
