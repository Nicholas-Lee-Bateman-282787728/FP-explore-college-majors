WTF is going on at the History Channel? The actual conspiracy behind the bombings is incredibly well documented.",1408665600,,333,7.538461538461538
8224643,5,B000WOSB3C,"I have been to the Oklahoma City Memorial and was influenced by the information center.  There is room that broke me down...it is the one with the names and pictures of the people, children that were killed that day.  The room has the picture and the name and along with the little placard a loved one left a memento with a note...there are alot of kids toys, a few Christmas ornamanets, letters, jewelry.  Although the people responsible have been accounted for, I have an interest in the OKC, because we were unprepared, and it was an American that did it.  The site and visitor center is a must see for everyone in the lower states, or those interested in a study of counter-terrorism.  The video clearly opens up more dialogue, when left by itself keeps the viewer wanting more.  Fortunaly, there is a lot of information on the OKC bombing, that helps fill some of the void.  Recommend this, as there are very few videos of this subject.  Any other videos, please let me know.",1322352000,,980,4.56
8224644,2,B000WOSB3C,"I purchased the dvd to use in a Criminal Justice class that I teach at a community college. The tape makes the allegation that the bombing may have been a conspiracy involving Middle Easterners, but gave virtually nothing to support that premise. I went into this exercise with experience and knew that in law enforcement circles this was viewed as an anti U.S. Government act, pay-back for Ruby Ridge and Waco. As a matter of fact McVeigh had believed that the agents responsible for Waco came from the Oklahoma City Office of the ATF and FBI.(They in fact did not, they came from D.C.) The video attenpted to raise a racial motive implying the McVeigh was a White Supremist, but the fact that his partner Nichols was married to an Asian mail order bride with a child, blocks that theory. Yes I think there was someone with McVeigh but this video does nothing to bring that person to light, and does little to explain McVeigh's background and motivation. Remember this was a combat hero who received  a bronze star medal for killing several Iraqi soldiers in Gulf War I. The issue and question of How and Why a partiotic young American blows up a federal building is never quite explained.",1305331200,,1190,4.666666666666667
