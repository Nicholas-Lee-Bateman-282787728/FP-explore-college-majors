7873423,4,6304481179,Kinda of low budget but I bought it for Sharon Bruneau had a crush on her when I was thirteen and started bodybuilding it was fun watching her in a movie,1493942400,,153,3.967741935483871
7873424,2,6304481179,"Another addition to my collection. This one is not as bad as many I own. Somewhere between the screen play, and the direction, and the actors the story loses about everything. Absolutely guaranteed to put you to sleep before you know it.",1281744000,,237,4.666666666666667
7873425,1,6304481179,"My error in buying this. I was in a hurry and thought it was Torpedo Run. I watched it, a real bad movie. made by clips from other movies.",1253836800,,138,3.793103448275862
7873426,1,6304481179,"This is the worst piece of JUNK to come out of Hollywood. The story AND acting STINK. This thing doesn't even make the ""D"" list, it's that BAD.

And to Cree Putney.....stop your whining. YOU should be paying the public to buy this cheap piece of trash.",1163116800,,252,4.361702127659575
7873427,3,6304481179,"After all these years, people are still buying this movie!  Somebody is making money on my film that I produced over 10 years ago.  It's amazing that I have not received a penny for all the effort that was put into this project.  I was only 25 years old when this was produced.  It was my first and last project at this scale.  Now I work for RE/MAX International in Denver, Colorado and produce and edit motivational videos for our associates, a very rewarding job.  If anyone can help me with making good on this project I would appreciate it.",1101859200,,545,4.4
7873428,1,6304481179,"I bought this movie because it was cheap, but it wasn't cheap
enough.  It starts out with what seems like hours of grainy stock footage of military aircraft in flight, landing, and taking off.  This is without a doubt the most boring aircraft footage I have ever seen.  Still, when the movie starts, it is difficult not to yearn for the stock footage again. The star is a female body-builder who pumps iron to get ready for the big battle scene. I guess her big biceps help here carry her automatic rifle.  The actors all went to the Ed Wood School of Acting (E.W.S.A.).  There is an imaginary love triangle which doesn't amount to anything.  There is dialogue that wants to make you put a paper bag over your head.  I gave this movie one star because I thought if I gave it no stars you might think I meant to give it 5 stars, but just forgot to type it in.",1047254400,6,858,4.2592592592592595
7873429,3,6304481179,"I thought this was a very good movie!  This was my first  attempt at  making a movie.  I produced, filmed, edited, sound EFX, and financed this  project.  My only problem I have is that I have not seen a penny from it.  Cree H. Putney",965692800,3,234,4.066666666666666
