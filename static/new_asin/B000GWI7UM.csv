8134979,4,B000GWI7UM,"Three attractive and listlessly directionless young men, two of them (as Benot Magimel and Romain Duris play them) and a less well-heeled baby-faced slacker (whom Clment Sibony portrays), attempt together to co-manage the erotic enterprise that they envision establishing. They have the willing participation -- and their main asset -- of an attractive girl (played by Zo Flix) who is more hard-headed and practical than the boys are and who probably would get on just as well without their help. That remains so until she, like the others (and the guys sooner than she), fall into some bad habits along the way, the most serious being excessive resort to drugs and booze. Worse than that, they attempt to cheat on, and to break contract with, some slick but low-life ""pros"" on the sexually sleazy side of the film industry. That redounds upon them, causing them yet further grief and, eventually, the lives of all three of them (and of the chief figure of the older and experienced sleaze-masters). Only the the girl emerges from all of this alive, but she, nonetheless, has her own harvest of woes that result from the venture.

The action of this 1998 motion picture takes place on the French Riviera, a colourful venue, although not exceptionally well enough filmed to make the most of that asset. Not surprisingly, given the subject matter of the film, there is plenty of bare skin on view, of males and females alike, including some of that female full-frontally.

The cast's three principal males are, every one of them, good-looking young actors who have risen to considerable prominence in the Francophone film industry. That is his far from least so in the case of Romain Duris, who would ascend later to a level of renown internationally, rather than only in the French market, from ""L'Auberge espagnole"" (""Pot Luck"") (2002) onwards. As for ""Dj mort"" itself, the DVD edition (PAL) viewed is Path EDV-1719-DIV-297-450-485. In ""Dj Mort"" (""Already Dead""), Duris has not quite attained the acting skill nor has he  matured yet into the good-looks that he would develop, in both regards, only a little bit later in subsequent movies. These actors (and that includes Zo Flix on the distaff side) are all figures of considerable importance in French film, whose work here is sampled fairly early in their respective careers, and they do put on a good show, especially Benot Magimel.

This DVD, which includes some playful courts mtrages among the bonus features, surely will be one that others, too, will be slipping into their video players more than just the first time that they play it!",1471392000,,2594,4.9290617848970255
