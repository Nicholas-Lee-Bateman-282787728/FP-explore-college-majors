7854097,5,6303893384,"My son, like many toddlers, loves elephants and would always demand that any elephant segment in his kid vids get replayed over and over - ad nauseum.  Well, we finally decided to purchase a tape that focuses  exclusively on elephants.  We bought ""Elephant"".  This is one of  the best contributions we have made to his, in fact, our own, video  library.  The tape is perfect.  It is the right length for a parent -  doesn't keep the kid glued to the tube forever and never gets boring to the  parent or toddler.  It has lots and lots of what my little one wants -  elephants, elephants and more elephants. The visuals are spectacular; the  score is a dream; Martin Sheen provides wonderful narrative.  It is a  directorial model of vivid and lush scenery - blending historical detail  and images with contemporary footage.  It delights with a great mix of ever  changing and stimulating images of elephants - animated and real.  There  are elephants in a studio in a magnificent white setting whom we come to  love as well as we do the elephants in the wild.  The image of the female  elephant herd marching across the plain single file behind the matriarch is  one of the most majestic I've ever seen on the screen, the music  underscoring the mood that the viewer is indeed witnessing one of the most  amazing marvels of nature.  I could go on.  I am not a naturalist or  animal lover, but this tape has certainly made me a convert -an enthusiast  of God's creatures and the earth.  I thank my little son for stimulating  my purchase of such a tape that is sure to be a joy to him, me and the rest  of my family for years to come.  I look forward to other tapes by this  producer.",957916800,,1682,4.421052631578948
