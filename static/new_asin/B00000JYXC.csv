1239653,3,B00000JYXC,"In this film Everhart is the only one that even comes close to being a grade ""A"" actor! Penny, Russo and unfortunately Eric Roberts who has done nothing noteworthy since ""The Pope Of Greenwich Village"" fame are all barely believable in their rolls! It's watchable and ends with a chuckle so it's not all bad!",1398211200,,308,4.618181818181818
1239654,1,B00000JYXC,"Quite frankly was expecting more from a film starring Angie Everhart, Eric Roberts, and James Russo.  Not worth the waste of time.",1389657600,2,130,4.909090909090909
1239655,3,B00000JYXC,"Beginning of movie Angie is sweet mannered then becomes bitter. This movie has Action / Thrills / Erotica / Suspense & will watch yet again. Starring Angie Everhart,James Russo,Brian Wimmer,Joe Penny,Francia Di Mase,Eric Roberts.",1388880000,,229,5.764705882352941
1239656,4,B00000JYXC,"If you like the tough gal, get even type you will love this movie. Angela Everhart is excellent as is Eric Roberts.",1376092800,,115,4.2727272727272725
1239657,1,B00000JYXC,I have no idea what the positive reviews saw but it could not have been this movie.  The script was stupid and the acting puerile.  I have seen better in a high school production.  I am glad I borrowed this movie instead of buying it.,1303689600,,234,4.155555555555556
1239658,4,B00000JYXC,"Are the pictures at the beginning of the Movie (the kid pics) actually Angie Everhart?! I totally think so. The one's of her as a teenager obviously look like her, so logically those are really her high school photos. Just thought that this was cool, especially since I've wanted to know what she looked like as a kid.",1179360000,,318,4.5
1239659,4,B00000JYXC,"I confirm other positive reviews about this work...
The best moments are clearly those where Ms. Everhart is engaged in action shoots (I think that Angie should exploit more this kind of role than those ones played in psycho-thrillers like the most recent The Last Cry... le physique est avec elle... in every sense) yet I'd have liked the captivity part to be a little developed... 5/10 min would have been enough and not have compromised the budget (IMO).
ps: actually I must admit that the first reason for me to rent this movie has been the presence of Angie ""Redhot"" Everhart but I've not been disappointed... bear in mind that this is the first movie of her I've seen where she has been wearing her dresses... full time... and that's is a compliment by me.",1030147200,10,762,4.610294117647059
1239660,4,B00000JYXC,"An excellent movie, Angie Everhart was a Refreshing departure from the normal helpless female, a sharp intelligent lady with a lot of positive mental attitude, More of the same Please!!",1020988800,5,185,5.2
1239661,3,B00000JYXC,Good thing Angie and Eric were in this movie....,1483920000,,48,4.444444444444445
1239662,5,B00000JYXC,Got to me...but I don't pay a lot of attention to the realism probablities of events...think of this as literature...Good film.  Highly recommended.,1482969600,,148,5.434782608695652
1239663,1,B00000JYXC,B movie at best.....find another way to be entertained.,1482537600,,55,5.222222222222222
1239664,3,B00000JYXC,Pretty good.,1479772800,,12,5.5
1239665,5,B00000JYXC,Very enjoyable and kept me on the edge of the seat.,1479168000,,51,3.727272727272727
1239666,4,B00000JYXC,"ok,  a bit slow at times.",1478304000,,25,3.1666666666666665
1239667,3,B00000JYXC,don't expect too much,1477440000,,21,4.5
1239668,5,B00000JYXC,Good movie,1476921600,,10,4.5
1239669,2,B00000JYXC,was able to watch it only because of Angie Everhart but bad movie,1476316800,,65,4.076923076923077
1239670,3,B00000JYXC,I'm a big Eric Roberts fan so I always enjoy his work. Plot was simple but good. But it wasn't a riveting movie and had some holes in it.,1476230400,,137,3.7586206896551726
1239671,1,B00000JYXC,"Quite simply, the actions of the characters make no sense whatsoever.  The most nonsensical movie I have watched in a long time.",1476144000,,128,4.818181818181818
1239672,3,B00000JYXC,"Eric Roberts is one of those actors who can portray malevolent evil believably. He does a good job in this one. The use of vulgar language lost its ability to indicate strong emotions decades ago, as it became more important for movie makers to push the envelope than make cogent movies. This was an otherwise watchable revenge flick.",1475625600,,334,4.775862068965517
1239673,2,B00000JYXC,"I just didn't like this movie. A nice girl goes to prison and comes out of it like she's a killer. I understand prison can change a person big time, but, to this extent, I don't think so. I guess I'm being a little too rigid, but I don't think they gave her shooting practice while in the pen. hah",1473379200,,297,3.966666666666667
1239674,4,B00000JYXC,good suspense show.  Did not like ending as you never know what happens to the hand cuffed guy....do police get him and find out what happened...seem to be left with no closure.,1472774400,,177,4.53125
1239675,5,B00000JYXC,Good movie,1470787200,,10,4.5

1239677,1,B00000JYXC,"This movie will take all of your patience to sit through it. One might sit through it (as I did) thinking it will surely get better. No such luck.
It is laughably inane. Put this one on your list to SKIP, even if it is for free.",1467763200,,228,3.872340425531915
1239678,1,B00000JYXC,Really old and bad -- not worth watching!,1464652800,,41,4.25

1239684,4,B00000JYXC,Great movie lots of action,1453507200,,26,4.4
1239685,5,B00000JYXC,"I was going to give it a 4, but the ending put it over the top. Started out with her angry and nothing else and each time he saved her or brought her away from one of her shooting sprees, she appreciated him more. They wore each other out from their own "" woe is me"" life to start life anew. Humorous ending "" I make a mean omelot"" and his "" Okay, But I'll make the coffee."" You have to see the movie to understand what that means. It was like a romantic crime spoof.",1453507200,,467,3.875
1239686,4,B00000JYXC,it is not the worst movie out there but it is not great I found it enjoyable and does got strong action worth buying I would say yes,1451088000,,132,3.75

1239689,1,B00000JYXC,Awful. Terrible. Why would Eric Roberts even been in it? Awful job in the editing room?,1445472000,,87,4.5
1239690,3,B00000JYXC,"This story of a woman's revenge against her ex-lover was not great.  Okay if you have time to waste otherwise not really recommending it,.",1441843200,,138,4.75

1239701,4,B00000JYXC,"Not Bad. Love seein' Eric Roberts getting clipped, made me laugh.  A knock off of the old revenge against the mob movies. Nice simple plot, FUN! Kept me laughing while I did my books. HAHAHAHAHA
Thank you Angie Everhart. YUM!!!!",1431216000,2,228,4.7

1239703,3,B00000JYXC,I wouldn't bother writing this if not for Angie Everhart's lead in the movie.  SHE was entertaining in her determined-woman-who-will-stop-at-nothing character hell-bent on revenge for her undeserved prison stint.  The story and the other actors were all so-so.  Angie kept me from bailing.,1427328000,3,289,5.674418604651163
1239704,4,B00000JYXC,Far better than I anticipated.  Nice acting and characters; Eric Roberts hair styles alone are worth watching.  Some nice action and killings.,1427241600,,142,5.409090909090909
1239705,2,B00000JYXC,Not sure why I spent time watching this.  Too much violence and not enough story.,1425945600,,81,4.4
1239706,1,B00000JYXC,"Stupid movie - heroine has never heard of rubber gloves or identification by finger prints and she can kill everyone except the one she's been gunning for all along...  The cop's line about if she wanted to ""rot in jail"" for killing her ex-, like she's not going to ""rot in jail"" for the ten people she killed before she got to him.  I have never written a review before but this movie was so BAD I felt morally obligated to warn the unknowing public away from watching it.",1422921600,3,473,4.303370786516854
1239707,4,B00000JYXC,"The acting wasn't the best; however, it wasn't a bad plot.",1415145600,,58,4.363636363636363
1239708,3,B00000JYXC,"Very poor movie expected morefromEric Roberts..would not recommended to anyone. Certainly not a favorite of mine. Poorly written, even worsened when inacted.",1403913600,,157,6.181818181818182

7913949,2,B00000JYXC,It was obviously low budget.  The male lead could act...the female not so much....the script needed a lot of work...not really worth the time.,1492041600,,142,4.916666666666667
7913950,5,B00000JYXC,I thought it was suspenseful and very under rated.,1490486400,,50,4.666666666666667

7913952,2,B00000JYXC,"Did not feel authentic. More like one of my father's ""shoot 'em ups"" when I was a child. A bunch of random actions with no meaning thrown together by the screenwriter in hopes of getting a sale, which obviously he/she did. There was no subtle subtext, no depth of character. This person needs to take the ProSeries at ScreenwritingU. It would be excellent for the writer and improve his/her skills.",1485820800,,398,4.7
