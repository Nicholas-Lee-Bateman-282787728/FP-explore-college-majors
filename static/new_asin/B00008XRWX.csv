1866583,3,B00008XRWX,"Synopsis: The '00 film 'Presence of Mind' is a slow but often haunting tale of the supernatural about an attractive but repressed young woman (Sadie Frost) who takes a position as governess over two children in a rambling mansion haunted by the previous custodian and governess. It's a story of mysterious pasts and untold secrets both on the part of the new governess and the children who are continual found playing near the areas where the two previous tenant died.

In an attempt to save the two children she attempts to persuade them to admit they're in communication with these two hostile spirits in the hope that consciously acknowledging their presence will set them free. Will her strategy be successful or will it only make the situation worse?

Critique: The story line of 'Presence of Mind' is a clever attempt at dealing with two aspects of haunting, the existence of ghosts and the more personal realm of inner demons within that play an integral role in shaping who we are and how we perceive the outer world. The film also delivers a strong, very Catholic subplot of ""redemption through suffering"" which gives the plot added substance and meaning. The soundtrack works beautifully with the visuals and theme, it's simple, flowing and intensely melancholy.

Unfortunately I found the ending to be unnecessarily obscure leaving too many aspects of this complex tale unexplored.  Also, if you're primarily considering to view this film because you're a Harvey Keitel fan be forewarned, he's only on screen for about four minutes or less.

My Rating: Overall satisfying but could have been better; -3 1/2 Stars-.",1218844800,6,1625,5.003703703703704
1866584,4,B00008XRWX,"I saw this is a very unpopular movie..as I bought it in the $5 bin at the electronics store.  I watched it and saw it was actually pretty good.  I can see why a lot of people don't like it, because it can be very confusing and misleading at times, but I thought it is very suspensful and fun.  :)",1095033600,7,296,3.9
1866585,2,B00008XRWX,"I'm not a horror fan, but I got this DVD for free, the cover looked attractive and boasted Harvey Keitel, and so I thought it couldn't be that bad.  Well, I was very disappointed.  The mood and atmosphere were quite stunning, and I must admit I was hooked at the beginning, but then after about 45 minutes, it was getting a bit monotonous and kinda leading to nowhere.
The story is based on Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw"", about a mysterious man's niece and nephew who live on an island in a . . . you guessed it, a so called haunted house.  Harvey, the uncle, is seen in only one scene for about 5 minutes when he interviews the new, inexperienced governess.  From the start, we notice superb acting and rich costumes very fitting to the eerie yet hypnotic and serene mood.  Everyone during conversations , including the governess who is the newcomer, seem to have secrets well hidden, and this intrigues the viewer and definitely builds suspense.  In fact, throughout the movie, her past remains much a mystery, which is quite disappointing since it seems far more interesting than the so called ghosts that ""haunt"" the children.
The film evolves in a well paced manner (at least for a psychological thriller) as we get bits and pieces (literally scraps) of the story from the maid, but the appearances of the ghosts are so few and far apart and so pointless that you sometimes forget the plot of the story.  The characters, though, are all so very interesting, especially that boy, Miles.  His interaction with the governess is quite subtle yet bold at times . . . enough to make you raise a brow and wonder what he's up to.  It's obvious he's confused about a thing or two he witnessed from the former ground's caretaker and governess, both who are now the tormented souls wondering around the property seeking the souls of the children.
The movie is quite good to study, but don't watch it to be spooked or thrilled to the bones.  It leaves you feeling empty, yet the beautiful photography and stunning visuals leave a lasting impression and at least gives the viewer the fuel to continue to the end of what some may feel to be rather dull.
I'll give it 2 stars and an additional 1/2 for arousing my curiousity and interest still a day later after seeing it.",1066262400,4,2269,4.552825552825553

7987860,1,B00008XRWX,"The biggest waste of time I have every spent watching a movie. Poorly put together with all questions gone unanswered and many which were brought to mind left me thinking ""what?"" No plot, no ending, and the children underwent shameful acts that shouldn't even be public. It was a disappointment in every way possible. The description that Amazon had written about this movie did not even fit what the content of the movie was about. This was the worst in my young life and I am 71 years old!",1515369600,,491,4.52808988764045
7987861,5,B00008XRWX,"This is a great movie - subtle, poetic and complex.  The bad reviews it is getting is a terrible injustice.  Perhaps because it doesn't have bad versus good characters, and a corny happy ending, it doesn't appeal to most Americans taste.  And I suspect it's too European in that sense for most of them.",1513036800,,302,4.555555555555555

7987863,1,B00008XRWX,"I watched this on Amazon tv and the description said
A theater composer finds himself in an ufortunate predicament as he is arrested for both the murder of his wife and supplying secret messages to enemies of the government thru his music, but the only crime he is truly guilty of his having an affair right before his wifes mysterious death

If you read the previous reviews what part of this movie is described above????
At least the description above sounded like a good movie. The actual movie was strange and made no sense, especially the end. I feel sorry for those children who had to play their parts in this movie. Do not waste your time.",1512259200,,647,4.52991452991453
7987864,2,B00008XRWX,"It's a shame to affiliate the name of Henry James, one of the greatest novelists in the English language, with this mish-mash interpretation of his novella.  Read ""Turn of the Screw.""  It's not a spook story but one of profound spirituality.  It's exquisite, ethereal and subtle, and chilling if you understand.",1512086400,,311,5.0588235294117645
7987865,1,B00008XRWX,Watched enough to realize it was demonic junk.,1511568000,,46,4.875
7987866,2,B00008XRWX,"Another version of Turn of the Screw, with a suggestion of murder and strongly spelling out child abuse-molestation as causes for Miles and Flora's corruption.  The synopsis seems to be for different film, though.  If you like the Henry James classic, you might like this--or hate it, if you hate versions that spell out the psychology of the characters and the evil that permeates the house.  If you were hoping for a murder mystery/thriller with Jude Law, this isn't it.",1511308800,,472,4.875
7987867,1,B00008XRWX,"I have to agree with the other negative review(s) here, this thing is slow and plodding in every department.  A lot of money went into this, but I was expecting a period spy thriller set in Victorian England, and instead got some kind of tale about sexual abuse.  Lots of money spent on sets and costumes, and apparently there's some mild horror element in the form of the main characters memories, so it's not the movie it's supposed to be in the least in the brief synopsis write up.

Don't waste your time.",1510099200,,509,4.451612903225806
7987868,1,B00008XRWX,"Don't waste your time on this one. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I won't even waste more of my time on writing a very long review on this one. Pointless, and shameful brief nudity of a young boy. Suggestions of sexuality with young children. I'm very surprised it is allowed to be viewed at all. And you struggle with the slowness of it and not rewarded in the end by anything other than darkness. The whole film is a very dark and dank tale. I found absolutely nothing good about it at all, other than the young actor and actress who play the children are very attractive. Maybe in the future they will find better films to be a part of.",1509926400,,657,4.181102362204724
