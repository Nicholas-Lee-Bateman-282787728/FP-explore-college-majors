8108044,5,B000EBDGK6,"Beautifully shot series (sometimes by the elephants themselves as the camera operators - watch and you'll understand!), this documentary, narrated by the amazing Sir David Attenborough follows a herd of elephants in the African bush with the equivalent of today's GoPro cameras (this was filmed in 2003). You'll watch elephant babies feed, make love, dust, take mud baths, fight for dominance, battle for mating, get dramatic with other herds (elephants are VERY ""human"" in many ways!), and just be as close as you'd ever want to be to an elephant without actually being there.

Elephants are very intelligent, emotionally deep, gentle animals who are poached every 15 minutes - yes, you read that right! - for their tusks as people in Asia, mainly China, believe the tusk has medicinal value. It doesn't; elephant tusk is made out of keratin, the same thing that makes up the human hair and nails! If the poaching doesn't stop, elephants will become extinct by 2025 - that's in 10 years from the date of this review.

What kind of a world would this be without elephants?

If you want to learn more about elephants, observe them in their natural habit - where they deserve to be! - and learn to love them, or just watch them because you already know and love them, as I do, watch this. It's a beautifully shot docmentary.

The version that I watched on my HDTV was not in widescreen, so you'll see the black sidebars (or, if you've set your tv to stretch non-wide screen, it might be a bit...well, stretched looking). In any case, it's very much worth watching this nearly 50 minutes of film and, quite frankly, I could have watched another extra hour of it, if available.",1440633600,,1673,4.719178082191781
