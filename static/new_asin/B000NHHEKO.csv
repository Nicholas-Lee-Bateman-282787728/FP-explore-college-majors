8177715,2,B000NHHEKO,Very poor quality video.  You can see a better quality version on YouTube.,1452988800,,74,4.6923076923076925
8177716,5,B000NHHEKO,"There are three movies on this DVD.

The first - named 'Target Berlin' - is a propaganda piece depicting the construction of the first Canadian-built Lancaster bomber by Victory Aircraft. It is very similar to those done about American bombers.

The second - named 'Eighth Air Force Report' - is a very short film presenting combat footage and a speech by General Eisenhower encouraging purchase of war bonds. It is the weakest of the three.

The third - named 'Target for Today' - is the reason for purchasing this excellent package. Running close to an hour in duration, it is the story of a bombing mission, giving the details of how the mission is planned and executed. This is done with a mixture of live-action and animation which goes into great depth. For example, the movie explains how a 36 aircraft bombardment group moves from its airfield to the target; then into bombing formation (something different than its combat box formation) and then reforms into the combat box after bombing to return home. A great education for those interested in the details of daylight bombardment.",1356912000,,1092,4.891891891891892
8177717,5,B000NHHEKO,"i just watched this and some of the companion films, made during the second world war.  these are really pretty amazing films from amazing times, when the military actively made films to talk about the war and the progress of the war.  what you see in these films is i guess a bit dolled up, but it is nevertheless pretty thrilling.  so many young americans died in the fight across Germany's skies, and these films are maybe the best living tribute to what happened over there except our real live vets.  anyway well worth a look.  don't expect a standard history channel documentary though, these are old fashioned films from the 40's.",1181779200,,637,4.651785714285714
8177718,5,B000NHHEKO,"Wow is this an incredible bit of history!  Not only do you get to see B-17s and Lancasters plastering Germany in ""Target for Today"", but I was surprised by ""Target Berlin"" which is also a really interesting and undervalued movie.  These are ""lost"" films which I saw as a kid, and I'm delighted to finally be able to add them to my video collection.

Another reviewer wrote about the quality of these films...they are pretty much what I remember when I saw them forty years ago...which is crummy combat footage that looks like what it is, shot with a 16mm movie camera by some poor guy freezing his patooties off in a bomber at 40,000 feet. Whatever!  The films themselves are amazing.",1181088000,,684,4.581967213114754
8177719,1,B000NHHEKO,"Well, i bought this DVD  as i wanted to see those historical-Aviation- propaganda-documentaries again. They were issued in the 80's on VHS in Europe in the ""After the Battle"" serie, with a good quality for the time. Now my VHS are more than 20 years old and i hoped to get an as good image as can be expected with a DVD. What a disillusion. These poeple from PERISCOPEFILM have allowed themselves to put a (as they say) Digitl Signal at the right low corner of the screen. It means that you've got a grey circle with a periscope during the whole show. How can they manage to deteriorate theses films this way? Are they so afraid of hacked copy that they prefer to mutilate those documents better than offering their customers a clean and proper vision? By the way, the film restoration is not as good as it could be done techically.

Should i have known all of this, i would have kept my money and tried to have a look and my old VHS.",1178928000,4,934,4.301136363636363
