It has thrill, drama, fear, suspicion that a thriller on a ship can bring about. Linsay and Angie all the actors and actresses involved are so convincing. Best scene is when Angie D.walks alone on the deck, at night, just before being killed. I just wish it had been more popular. And I' m sorry it' not on DVD or BD.  I' m optimistic....Anyway, It is possible yo watch it, even though not remastered, on You Tube. But it would be wonerful to buy it on Disc.",1515801600,,611,4.222222222222222

7829124,5,6302658918,"After boarding a cruise ship Lindsey Wagner finds her husband missing. While trying to locate him with the help of the ships personnel, she learns there is no trace of him aboard the ship, nor evidence that he ever boarded. Even worse, there is evidence that he doesn't exist at all except in Wagner's mind. She has a past history of psychosis and a suicide attempt, which doesn't lend in her favor.

Wagner is excellent as the confused and frantic passenger. Since we never saw her husband, the viewers won't know until the end whether she is a lunatic or not. This movie keeps you guessing and on your toes, while you separate the facts from the fiction.

Much of the mood is achieved through the facial expressions of the actors. Each one of them has a knack for timing their lines just right, and knowing when to throw just a whisper of a sideways glance. It's worth watching just for that alone. You'll watch this one again and again even after the ending has been revealed and you know it by heart.",1260835200,3,1004,4.48087431693989
