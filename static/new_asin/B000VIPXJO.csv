2942253,4,B000VIPXJO,The DVD brought back memories of the show I watched on Sunday nights when I was young. The quality was good for a show from the 50's.,1395705600,,133,3.962962962962963
2942254,5,B000VIPXJO,"Loved it! I loved Ann Sothern in this role as well as another tv series she was in, which I cannot find on DVD yet. Yes the quality of the first video is a little shaky but considering the age of the film etc, overall it was great!",1393891200,,231,3.8333333333333335
2942255,3,B000VIPXJO,"BIG RIPOFF.
I thought it was 4 seasons, but the packaging is just for 4m :22 minute episodes per dvd case. Very disappointing. Not worth the money. I sent it back for a refund. : - (",1379462400,3,182,3.945945945945946
2942256,3,B000VIPXJO,"The films were not in good condition....for example....sometimes you see hair hanging down from the top of the projector.  Some episodes were very funny but others had annoying guests.  It was good to see famous actors like Jesse White and Richard Deacon appearing as guests.  I like the main characters of Susie, Violet and the Boss.  As I recall on Nick at Nite....they worked at a hotel but these episodes they worked at a talent agency.  I have only watched two of the four DVDs at this time.  Ann Sothern is just as funny as Lucy.  The boss is very believable (Don Porter) and Violet as the switchboard operator is excellent....she really adds to the plot and laughs.  My favorite episode so far is when the boss asks Susie to read a manuscript,  she tells Violet to read it (nobody wants to read it)...then Violet tells someone in the other office to read it, then everyone gets mixed up.  The guest star was Howard McNear who played the barber in the Andy Griffith Show.",1362182400,2,977,4.563218390804598

2942258,5,B000VIPXJO,"Private Secretary is one of TV's all time great comedies. The episodes presented are all top notch as far as the acting, writing, etc. THE PROBLEM IS...this Alpha Video set (which I own), is absolutely 4th class, low quality, almost unwatchable. They used beat up 16MM movie prints, chopped up, unrestored, full of splices, sound track is choppy and out of sync, or missing altogether in some spots, video is full of lines, blotches, off center, and the movie prints themselves, even though several of the episodes shown ranged in air date from approx. 1953 to 1957, they had the ending credits (copyright 1956) from this one season spliced into the end of each episode (although the actor's names in the episode were correct). Amazon sells this same set of shows on another release from Critic's Choice, which was a later release and digitally restored with a decent video & sound track. Get that one if you can find it. Thanks!",1334361600,15,929,4.77639751552795
2942259,4,B000VIPXJO,"This show inspired me to become a secretary, which I just retired from after 48 years.  I had more than one ""Mr. Sands"" and hope I was a Suzy to at least some of them.  The resolution is good considering how old this series is, and my only complaint was that it didn't come with closed captioning, which I unfortunately need at this point in my life.  Otherwise, it was a lovely surprise and a warm memory. I would for sure recommend it to others.",1299628800,9,447,4.235294117647059
2942260,4,B000VIPXJO,"Sitcoms from the 1950's rarely get more adorable than PRIVATE SECRETARY.  When the Hollywood roles started drying up amidst the collapse of the studio system, Ann Sothern (like so many actresses of a ""certain age"" did in that period) re-focused her talents for television.  PRIVATE SECRETARY ran between 1953-57 on CBS; a firm ratings winner.

Ann Sothern is Susie MacNamara, secretary to Peter Sands (Don Porter) at the International Artists talent agency in New York.  And before you assume it, no...this isn't some lame rehash of ""I Love Lucy"", with a starry-eyed Susie trying her darndest to worm her way into showbusiness.  Instead Susie concentrates on asserting her skills (and charm) to assist Peter in landing top clients and sorting out the various problems encountered in the agency.  Most of the stories focus on the relationship of Susie and Peter, as they dance around an obvious, unspoken flirtation, though the writers thankfully never allowed the chemistry to break.  Ann Tyrrell is Susie's daffy workmate Vi Praskins (a real scene stealer...why wasn't she spun off?); Jesse White has a recurring role as Peter's main talent rival Cagey Calhoun.  Guest stars include Hillary Brooke, Jean Parker, a young Harry Shearer, ZaSu Pitts, Hope Summers, and Richard Deacon.

These DVDs from Alpha contain a total of sixteen episodes (under the ""Susie"" syndication titles) taken from the final two years of PRIVATE SECRETARY's original run (1956-57).

Includes:
* Cat on a Hot Tin File
* Elusive
* Dollars and Sense
* The Efficiency Expert
* Oh, Brother!
* The Little Caesar of Bleeker Street
* Passing the Buck
* Sow's Ear
* How to Handle the Boss
* What Every Secretary Knows
* Her Best Enemy
* Three's a Crowd
* That's No Lady, That's an Agent
* Not Quite Paradise
* Two and Two Make Five
* Thy Name is Sands",1281830400,20,1818,4.873376623376624
2942261,5,B000VIPXJO,"Private Secretary was a summer replacement series for I Love Lucy.  Its leading players were Ann Sothern and Don Porter.  It was written for the typical television viewer of the era:  eastern sophisticates who had money and educations.  The situations for comedic effect were typical for the time:  Susie asks her officematers for help managing money and then bullies them into giving her back her money.  Susie is adopted at the office by a cat.  Her boss's client, a prima donna, is allergic to cats.  Susie fixes the prima donna's psychosis.  Violet, the receptionist, invites Susie and her boss home for dinner with her Aunt Martha.  Martha and her friend concoct a scenario in which the boss and Violet are on the verge of engagement.  Hilarity ensues.  Well written.  Well acted.  A genuine museum piece.",1263081600,,810,4.9037037037037035
2942262,5,B000VIPXJO,"Growing up on the old Nick at Nite lineup where true classic television series were shown, I feel like the shows of the 1950s and 1960s were very much a part of my childhood so I was thrilled to see ""Private Secretary"" (later dubbed ""Susie"" in syndication) available on DVD. However, I never saw this series but I vividly remember loving  ""The Ann Sothern Show"" and figured I'd give it a whirl. I'm very glad I did. ""PS"" is in the same vein as ""Ann Sothern"" and even features the same cast. Yes, the story lines are dated and yes, some of the jokes are corny, but the writing and comic timing of the cast is still fresh even after all this time. That being said, the only complaints I have about this set is the fact that only four random episodes are featured on each disc (equaling 16 episodes). ""PS""  ran for five seasons, so I'm actually a bit disappointed that an entire set or season hasn't been issued. There's also the problem with the quality. These episodes are definitely NOT remastered and as another reviewer stated, the soundtrack is warbly and, at times, static-y. While I'm thrilled to have any Ann Sothern television show available on DVD, I think that it's high time that some company starts releasing these old gems in a proper set. This show isn't for everyone and only die-hard 1950s sitcom or Ann Sothern fans will value this release...even if the music sounds like a drunk band is playing!",1209945600,27,1412,4.533333333333333
8218938,1,B000VIPXJO,"The Sitcom itself -- a sophisticated comedy, not belly laughs but amusing and in an environment  related to the arts and management.  Try and get THAT one to fly these days in the offices of television programming executives.  Even the beginning is a very gentle, nearly imperceptible brushstroke of a light going on in Suzie MacNamara's mind and the ever so subtle ""Aha"" moment.  The VISUAL QUALITY of the disks is woefully lacking in what I thought would be a far better quality than that available on YouTube.  So, fire up that old YouTube account and forget this release.  FIVE stars on the subject matter and the stars, ZERO stars on every other count.",1498867200,,657,4.719298245614035
