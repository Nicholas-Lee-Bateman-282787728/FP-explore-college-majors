The butlers are a great incentive to watch alone, lol, but the show really is fun and very entertaining.  The only con is the translation.  While its fine for most of the episodes, it seems to really fall apart on the last two.  The names aren't even right so I had to really concentrate on what new name replaced the original, but you can hear the correct one being said so that helps.  I don't know why those last two were so bad, the previous ones were fine.  At least at that point you pretty much know whats going on anyway, but it was a let down.
I wish there was more than just the 2 seasons, while the story is wrapped up completely, there is an opening for more but so far I haven't seen anything released.
Overall this is a great J-drama worth getting, even with the bad translation on the last 2 episodes.",1295049600,,912,4.236994219653179
3831799,5,B0021B0FBA,"I just finished watching this, and love it. When I read the synopsis here I thought, OK, another one of those silly premis Japanese films that are sometimes so good---and it is. If I were to give it a genre, I would say Fairy Tale. The men in this story are exactly what husbands and boyfriends should be!  :-)because each of the rich young ladies in this private high school comes with a highly skilled, handsome young butler-who shares her living quarters and takes care of her. A butlers' loyalty to his beloved mistress is rock solid and unbreakable, in every case. This is because the butlers choose the girls they will serve, rather than the other way around.
The subtitles aren't perfect, but OK for someone used to reading subs, they are just fine, and maybe a little better than that. Certainly understandable.
This is not just silly though, it's a drama with a lot of tough, difficult situations, arising from school bullying. And again, as in real life, the school officials know and do nothing. Also, as in real life when a girl gets bullied-all the terrible stuff that goes on is usually initiated by a girl who is jealous of another girl, over a boy or a man. Every time I hear or read of a schoolgirl from JR high on up getting bullied, I would bet money that the bullied girl is good looking. The bullied girls' butler does his best to protect her from a whole group of girls + the bullys' butler!
Includes a very sweet and powerful love story. It is non-stop action, and the character development is excellent, given just as much weight and importance as the plotline. As it should be.
I will watch this again and again!",1285200000,3,1637,4.511784511784512
3831800,4,B0021B0FBA,"This was a an enjoyable series if you are looking for something funny and light. As with all Asian/Japanese/Taiwan/Chinese films that have English subtitles, the translations become worse the closer the the end of the series you get. However, the company that sent the item to me was wonderful, they sent the product quickly and it arrived in perfect condition. :)",1270166400,,364,4.983606557377049

8348890,5,B0021B0FBA,Love this movie. real cute men serving women who could ask for more. oh yea there is sword fighting also.,1439251200,,105,4.3
8348891,4,B0021B0FBA,"For the most part, all of the episodes have perfect subtitles...but the last disk had so many problems that I had to look up the episodes online. I don't think it's a legit copy to be honest. If you're going to buy this, PLEASE KNOW THAT THE LAST DISC HAS INCORRECT SUBTITLES.",1424217600,,276,4.326923076923077
8348892,5,B0021B0FBA,"Just perfectly wonderful.  It's t.v. series for any girl who has ever dreamed about ""Mr. Right"".  The show has a lot of humor through-out the series.  A butler for every girl.",1390953600,,175,4.580645161290323
8348893,3,B0021B0FBA,good show a little different to some but it was good but it did jump some wish it did not thank you for send it,1389225600,,111,3.48
8348894,5,B0021B0FBA,This is a very interesting series & pretty kooky to watch. The only downside is that the english translation breaks down a bit towards the end of the series.,1374278400,,157,4.448275862068965
8348895,5,B0021B0FBA,"I had seen the show digitally, and other than the very poor subtitles in the last episode (not the seller's fault at all!) it is a great DVD.",1373760000,,141,4.071428571428571
8348896,4,B0021B0FBA,"I really enjoyed this show, and for the most of it the subtitles were done perfectly, but for some reason the last couple episode's subtitles were done so terribly that it was hard to know what was going on. All of their names were different, a lot of the sentences didn't make sense at all, and that took a lot away from the story. To me the ending is the most important part of a story, and its hard to enjoy it when I'm trying to decipher what is going on. I'm still glad I was able to watch this, I'm still happy to own this, but just beware about those bad subs at the end so you won't be too disappointed when it happens.",1372204800,2,627,4.024
8348897,3,B0021B0FBA,"This was a very cute, family-friendly drama for the first 8 episodes. Unfortunately, the last two episodes took a detour into Goofy Subtitle Land. All of the characters names were changed to Chinese spellings, and the dialogue became very stilted and ungrammatical (for English). It's obvious that the ran out of money before finishing the English subtitles, and then ran the existing Chinese subs through Google translate. This seems to be a common problem with Japanese DVDs.

The DVD was delivered very promptly, and the seller did refund my money after I notified them of the problem, so they do get points for customer service. I just do not recommend this title until they come out with an authorized U.S. edition.",1339891200,,720,4.950413223140496
8348898,5,B0021B0FBA,"I am a big fan of Korean dramas and just recently got into Japanese Dramas.  I loved Mei-Chan No Shitsuji!  The actor who plays Rihito is so subtle and charming...  It is very romantic, without all the graphic stuff that American primetime dramas seem to have.  The main character, Mei, is quirky and spunky, the way all good drama heroine's should be and I liked the way they developed her relationship with the other girls at the school.  I found this plot original and interesting, even if the ""evil girl"" was a little too over-the-top evil to be realistic.  I really liked this drama alot and would recommend it to anyone who likes old-fashioned forbidden romance...",1336521600,,670,4.732758620689655
