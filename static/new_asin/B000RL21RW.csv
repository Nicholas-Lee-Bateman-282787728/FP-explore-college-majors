2869062,4,B000RL21RW,"I love watching this DVD because I'm a ferret owner and I just love seeing all the ferrets and their owners at the Buckeye Bash. The only downside is the singing segments in between scenes...I really dislike the song and the creepy way it is sung. But I can mute it during those parts!
The documentary goes into things that only ferret owners would understand, so I really like the way it shows how great of pets they are. They way it portrays the owners that show their ferrets makes them look a bit like nutcases...which I also don't like. But it is a very entertaining movie.
The only thing missing on this DVD is some special features. But overall, I'm happy I purchased it!",1235952000,3,678,4.432
2869063,5,B000RL21RW,I had originally purchased this dvd because I recently got a deaf ferret and this movie has a segment on training them which is very helpful. The rest of the dvd was interesting. Although there is a crazy woman who sings a ferret song that made me laugh. I thought I was crazy!,1211068800,,277,4.245283018867925
2869064,5,B000RL21RW,My daughter has four ferrets and thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  She liked the shows and the look into the homes of the owners and their ferrets.  The parts where they dressed them up was so funny.  I'd recommend this DVD to any ferret owner or maybe just anyone who needed a laugh.,1199664000,,280,4.346153846153846
2869065,5,B000RL21RW,"This was hilarious.  If you enjoyed the move ""Best in Show"" by Christopher Guest, then you will love this actual documentary.  There are no actors here, its the real thing.",1189987200,13,172,4.7
2869066,5,B000RL21RW,"This program really shows the bond ferret lovers have with their pets and it brings out the humor and playfulness that's associated with ferrets in general.  As a ferret owner, I found this program to be a delight.  You can tell that a lot of thought went into putting this together, right down to the ""caper/heist"" music in the background while the ferrets were stealing everything in sight while Mom was distracted by a phone call.  It also profiles the goings on in a major ferret show.  It actually prompted me to attend that show this year (in Ohio and I live in Florida) and it was as much fun as was portrayed by this program.",1188172800,8,633,4.431034482758621
2869067,5,B000RL21RW,"I greatly enjoyed this show.  Having met Mark Lewis, the producer, he really did a fine job of putting together over 500 hours of taped interviews and showed ferret owners as real people.  I hope he wins another Emmy for this show.

Living in Columbus I have the oportunity to go to the Ferret Buckeye Bash every year and can attest that it great show to go to.  Ferret owners should consider coming and showing their pets.  I for one will purchase the DVD to show support to PBS and Radio Pictures so they will continue to produce this type of program.",1184803200,8,553,4.382352941176471
2869068,1,B000RL21RW,"I was incredibly disappointed in the program ""FERRETS: THE PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE"" shown on my local PBS station last night.  As a ferret owner I was appalled by the treatment of the ferrets depicted.  Many scenes focused on owners roughly handling their pets by throwing them into the air, using bed sheets to launch them into air, or other negligible acts.  While ferrets are hardy, flexible animals they are not toys and should not be treated as such.  I feel this program glorified this type of rough and uncalled for treatment of these small loving animals.",1184803200,8,561,4.8125
2869069,5,B000RL21RW,"I saw this free on oregon pbs and it is so excellent! I fyou like ferrets, buy it!! You will laugh you will cry you will not be disappointed!",1184716800,4,141,3.896551724137931
2869070,4,B000RL21RW,"No subtitles? You suck. Cute documentary, but I didn't learn as much about ferrets as I did about ferret lovers...",1412380800,,114,4.75
2869071,4,B000RL21RW,"A must have documentary for any furry weasel enthusiast!!
Would have been nice to have some bonus content, but the film itself is so cute it's worth getting for multiple viewings.",1405382400,,179,4.806451612903226
2869072,5,B000RL21RW,"Never before have I seen something on TV and immediately bought the DVD. This film is a beautiful commentary on the human condition.

Also ferrets. Lots of ferrets.",1400544000,3,164,4.857142857142857
2869073,5,B000RL21RW,It was so very nice to find a dvd about ferrets! I learned some things about ferrets that I didn'tnow about and watching the ferret shows  was great! A must buy!,1395273600,2,161,4.193548387096774
2869074,5,B000RL21RW,"I have to to love it - I'm in it!  Some silliness, some strangeness....but adorable ferrets captured ""in the act"".",1387929600,,114,4.7
2869075,5,B000RL21RW,"If you're a ferret lover, you need this video!  It shows what clowns ferrets can be, and just how quirky their owners can be too! Some of it is very comical, some a tad bittersweet. There are also clips from the Ohio Buckeye Bash ferret competition, the prep work that goes into winning those ribbons, and what happens when someone gets their nose too close! :)  Overall, a cute DVD for a ferret lover and would also be great for kids who are animal lovers.",1361491200,2,457,4.364705882352941
2869076,4,B000RL21RW,"I first saw this special on PBS several years ago.  Watched it with my dog (a west highland terrier) and we both loved it.  It's a perfect combination of quirky documentary and laugh out loud comedy.  Wish it were 1) longer and 2) not quite as expensive.  Shelling out $20 for only about an hour of footage was tough, but definitely worth it.",1360540800,,342,4.380952380952381
2869077,5,B000RL21RW,This is a really cute video on ferrets. It shows the unique personalities that ferrets have and shows how much fun they can be.,1357862400,,127,4.333333333333333
2869078,5,B000RL21RW,This video is fun to watch! The Ferret songs that the lady sings will grow on you! Informational as well.,1357430400,,105,4.3
2869079,5,B000RL21RW,Its hard to find informative programs on ferrets there are so few.  Here is one covering the fun side of ferrets!,1355788800,2,113,4.380952380952381
2869080,5,B000RL21RW,"This is a wonderfully produced video of the Ohio Buckeye Ferret Show.  It has all the elements and emotions of such an event.  Whether you're a seasoned owner who has entered your ferrets in national shows, never attended a show, or owned a pet ferret, you will appreciate and enjoy this documentary style video.  The shows are fun and interesting.  For ribbons and trophies, there's also varying levels of competition (depending if you're a general ferret owner, or if you are a private breeder).  The judging is somewhat different, but just as in a cat or dog show,  there's applause, smiles, surprises, and even tears, when the Best of Show winner is announced.  This video will give a unique glimpse into the world of ferret shows, ferrets, and the humans that love and care for them.",1355443200,2,788,4.75
2869081,5,B000RL21RW,"Highly recomended for those of you with an ""off"" sense of humor. This documentary is about people who have show-ferrets - like show dogs - it's like ""Best in Show"" movie - but real, and about ferrets. hysterical",1350432000,,211,4.578947368421052
2869082,3,B000RL21RW,"It gave alot of information about showing ferrets, but it didn't really get into the details of what it would take to care for one. It glamorized ferrets as an ideal pet and didn't say anything about what goes into owning one responsibly. It is good for getting the word out about these wonderful pets, but it also makes ferret owners look a little crazy.",1300752000,2,355,4.476923076923077
2869083,4,B000RL21RW,"I completely understand all the ferrets owners in this documental, they feel the same I do for my ferrets, it's kind of like an obsession. The only thing i didn't like, was the ferrets shows they felt so proud of, I don't know if the PBS is actually against or in favor of them but the majority of the documental was about the shows, how the owners breed the ferrets for the shows... just horrible! I think it would have been better if they centered the attention in other topics, like shelters, diseases, the problems that ferrets have today and how to stop them, not stupid shows.",1299456000,5,582,4.4485981308411215
2869084,5,B000RL21RW,"This is possibly the most hilarious movie I have ever seen, besting such rivals as Reefer Madness (both versions), Monty Python anything, The Office, and Best In Show.  In format and style of humor, it is most similar to Best in Show/Spinal Tap, though it makes those films seem forced and clunky.  Here, the awkwardness flows freely and smoothly, made all the better by the knowledge that no one is an actor.  This is truly an epic of the humor genre.  For a teaser, see youtube.",1295222400,9,480,4.546511627906977
2869085,5,B000RL21RW,"I originally viewed this on PBS and knew that I must own it. I do not own a ferret nor will I ever. (I certainly don't have the time or energy that these true ferret  lovers devote to their unusual ""pets"".) I do, however, appreciate those who live life a bit on the edge. The owners profiled truly love their animals and their lives. We can all learn a bit from them...",1290297600,,369,4.125
2869086,5,B000RL21RW,"I bought this as a gift after seeing it on PBS and being amused and sort of disturbed by the ferret obsessed people in this program. It came super quickly (I wasn't sure it would get here before Christmas but it did!) and was in great condition! Thank you so much for this, it absolutely made my boyfriend's Christmas. He was so excited to find it online and now to finally own it.",1265587200,,381,4.232876712328767
2869087,5,B000RL21RW,"I happened to catch the last half of this on PBS once.  My wife and I both just sat there engrossed in the TV for nearly 20 minutes before either of us said a word.  Needless to say, we immediately looked for when it would be on again and recorded it.  Now we own this DVD.  This documentary is mind-boggling entertaining.  Words truly fail.",1248220800,5,341,4.265625
2869088,5,B000RL21RW,"Loved this documentary when it first aired on PBS.  The ferret owners are quite the characters, even more so then their playful pets!",1243555200,,133,4.782608695652174
2869089,5,B000RL21RW,"After watching this moving documentary, I couldn't help but watch it a second time, and a third time and a fourth time and well...now I think I'm somewhere around 15 times.  While I am not a ferret owner, I am inspired by the conviction of the ferret owners who dedicate copious amounts of their free time to playing with the ferrets, wearing ferret clothing, decorating their house with ferret trinkets and even getting ferret tattoo's!  This film displays the self-sacrificing lifestyle that ferret owning entails.  A definite blockbuster!",1241654400,3,541,5.125
8201240,5,B000RL21RW,Honestly I was looking for more information about starting to show my pet ferrets for fun. Came across this and adored it. Lovely information in a documentary format.

8201241,5,B000RL21RW,"This is my favorite PBS special. It's like Best in Show, but real life. My husband bought it for me half as a joke, but joke was on him because we sat and watched it again.",1498694400,,172,3.8055555555555554

8201247,5,B000RL21RW,"Calling all ferret lovers!
I VERY highly recommend the film ""The Pursuit of Excellence: Ferrets"", it is a funny, cute, sweet, informational, relatable documentary about ferrets. I watched it countless times when it came out in 2007 with my first ferrets ^_^
 I just ordered it on amazon because I haven't seen it since my last ferrets, and I want to be able to sit down and watch it again with my new babies 

It covers so many things including the loss of our previous fuzzballs :( and the happy playtime! And how when you come home, no matter how bad of a day you might be having, they can always cheer you up ^_^ I insist you all check it out. It is a joy to watch and will make you laugh, cry, swoon from the adorableness, and love your thieving weasels even more than you do now (if that's even possible).",1419897600,,810,4.281045751633987
