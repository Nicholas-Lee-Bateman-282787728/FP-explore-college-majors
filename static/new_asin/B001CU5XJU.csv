8289259,2,B001CU5XJU,"This 1973 movie has a couple of alternative titles:  ""Matthew"" and ""The Captive Female.""  Regardless of the title, the movie is not very interesting.  There are many deaths and lots of blood, but the principal character makes little progress throughout the film so I eventually got bored because all the deaths and blood ultimately seemed pointless to me.

Matthew, played by Fred Holbert in his only screen role (I guess this movie killed whatever career he might have had), kills his father at the beginning of the movie.  Matthew manages to mangle his arm shortly after killing his father and he gets a hook as a replacement.

Matthew goes to a mental hospital for a long time.  The movie does not explain whether Matthew went to the hospital because the ""accident"" traumatized Matthew or whether the authorities sent Matthew to the mental hospital because he murdered his father.  Regardless, Matthew grows up and gets out of the hospital.

Once Matthew returns home, we quickly learn that Matthew has some serious issues.  Matthew kills his mother and she then haunts Matthew for the rest of the movie.  Matthew sees his mother everywhere, and every time he sees his mother, he has to kill her all over again.  It must be tedious killing the same person repeatedly.

Matthew does find a girl who he likes, Vera, whom he calls Daisy.  Leigh Mitchell plays Vera/Daisy, one of only two roles in her not-too-lengthy career.  He impresses her with his mansion and his car, obtained with some more blood.  Vera quickly finds out that Matthew is a wacko, so Matthew has to tie Vera up to keep her under control.  Then there is some more blood, Matthew has some more visions of his mother, and we get to the ""surprise"" ending, which was actually a little bit of a surprise.

Most of the actors in this movie had a very short career, most ending with this movie.  However, way down in the credits is a fellow by the name of Rory Guy who played Dr. Epstein.  This movie was Rory Guy's second movie.  Six years after this movie Rory Guy changed his name to Angus Scrimm and achieved movie immortality as The Tall Man in ""Phantasm.""

The picture quality of this movie is poor.  This movie does need remastered.  However, given that the movie is not very good, remastering is likely not in the cards any time soon.  The sound is acceptable.

This movie is a blatant gore fest with very little in the way of any redeeming value.  A synopsis would be ""Matthew runs around hacking people to death in various ways,"" the end.  However, if you are a fan of the ""Phantasm"" movies, seeing Angus Scrimm/Rory Guy early in his career as a stuffy doctor is hilarious.  Indeed, I gave this movie two stars because of the appearance of Angus Scrimm.

Good luck!",1301011200,,2739,4.634095634095634
