8628657,5,B001Q9SCIQ,Interesting all the way through.  Recommended for people at least  -somewhat- conversant with Catholic teachings and culture.  Nice diversion from the noise of everyday life.,1528243200,,174,5.88

8628659,5,B001Q9SCIQ,"I loved the book, but other family members enjoyed this a lot as well. Whether you've already read ""My Life with the Saints"" or not, this content can stand on its own. Father Martin has an engaging style that enlivens what could be considered a dry subject. He shares interesting anecdotes about his subject matter, and the film is arranged in such a way that there are logical ""breaks"" where you can easily pause and reflect, or leave unwatched portions for a later time.

Generally, I like Father Martin's body of work... and whether it's new to you or you've read/heard his content in other places, I think you'll find this to be a good use of your time (if learning about the saints holds any interest for you).",1498867200,,715,4.542635658914729
8628660,3,B001Q9SCIQ,"Allow me to be honest here.  Personally, Father Martin's folksy, humorous, ""just a regular guy"" persona doesn't much resonate with me.  Plus, I look to the saints for a sense of the sacred, the transcendent, and focusing on their quirks and shortcomings without as much focus on their grace and blessedness left me wanting more.  These are thumbnail sketches, each prefaced and followed by the same credits, which gets old quick, and where the nearly two hours went I have no idea because it felt more like an hour at best.  I was hungry for more depth, details.

There are 12 profiles: Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Joan of Arc, Francis of Assisi, Mother Teresa, Ignatius Loyola, Bernadette of Lourdes, Pope John XXIII, Therese of Liseux, Joseph, Peter, and Mary, Mother of Jesus.  Out of these I enjoyed Thomas Merton's, Little Therese's, and St. Ignatius's- the others not as much.  I suggest you rent on Amazon before buying, because had I done so I wouldn't have purchased.  That's me though, you may love it.",1476576000,3,1012,4.809248554913295
8628661,5,B001Q9SCIQ,"Great video with some good info on the saints.  I used it for a series of meetings after daily Mass.  We had coffee and donuts, watched a video clip from it and had discussion.  People were happy and stayed focused and attentive.",1464048000,,229,4.404761904761905
8628662,5,B001Q9SCIQ,"Really love Fr. Martin's insight!  Great quotes, images, and information on several fascinating & inspirational Holy People, including: Thomas Merton; Dorothy Day; St. Joan of Arc; St. Francis of Assisi; St. Mother Teresa; St. Joseph; The Holy Blessed Mother Mary; St. Peter; Pope St. John XXIII; & St. Ignatius.  My ONLY very minor complaint - is that they run the credits for each segment separately.... a mild inconvenience. I really loved this, though! Wish there were even more!!!",1461542400,,485,5.205128205128205
8628663,5,B001Q9SCIQ,"In true Father James Martin style this DVD is both entertaining and enlightening. Father Martin gives a brief overview of 12 saints, some from the time of Christ, some from medieval times and some modern. He also explains what a saint is, the process by which the Catholic  Church declares someone a saint ,  why it is important to look to their examples and  why Catholics pray to them.
Photographs and artwork help the stories of the Saints come to life. This would be a very good resource to use as an introduction to Catholic saints.",1439337600,,537,4.572916666666667
