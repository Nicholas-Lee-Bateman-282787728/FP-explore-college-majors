Frightfully informative about Peter becoming co-tsar (?) with brother and getting whispered instructions upon the thrown. He is initially schooled as per usual but declines and heads out on his own to learn from MEN!

Eventually he goes to Europe to encounter all the knowledge there that has not come to Russia (late 1600's to early 1700's). He eventually becomes The Tsar and decides Russia needs a sea port, so he battle the Turks and then the powerful Army of...Sweden? He has a son but the lad is uninterested in the 'New Ways' his father aspires to bring to the country, despite that his father pusses anyway as the son will eventually have to be the Tsar.

The son finally leaves and is tracked down and brought home for a non Welcome Home party. A sad mess.

Shared with interviews, artwork, and reenactments, insightful, explains how Red Square got its name.",1509148800,,932,4.7407407407407405
8170723,5,B000MQ58YU,"This is a very good video. Very factual with good acting and direction.

This video is a good compliment to Massie's book ""Peter the Great: His Life and World"" and the VHS movie ""Peter the Great"" 1994.",1398556800,,201,4.4324324324324325

A lot of the early historical videos were dull, with dull music, and a dull narrator.  Wrath of the Tsar contains the total opposite.  The dramatic re-actments make it exciting to watch.  The special effects make it entertaining, and the narrator talks with a voice that make the historical DVD great to listen to.  This DVD is an GREAT video to show to a history class because it's tailored to keep it entertaining to students and last but not least, I learned so much history and information about Peter the Great that you will not get in a history book.  GREAT WAY TO GET STUDENTS interested in history class!!!!",1181520000,8,776,4.539568345323741
