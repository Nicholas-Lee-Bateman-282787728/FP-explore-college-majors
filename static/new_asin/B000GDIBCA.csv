8130750,5,B000GDIBCA,"Nice disk, beautiful artwork. A friend of mine came to my house and saw it and immediately ordered one for himself! I love this disk  and I watch it often. Happy with the product and the way the filming was done - very professionally. Pleasant to watch.",1248652800,2,253,4.382978723404255
8130751,5,B000GDIBCA,"We found out about this artist at a gallery in San Diego and fell in love with his work on the spot. We returned a few weeks later to look at his painting again and possibly purchase one for our newly decorated living room. The $2,500 price tag was out of our means, so I came home with a plan of getting his coffee table book to enjoy. When I came to Amazon.com to find the book, I found this DVD and ordered it instead. We played it on our tv all Christmas day and got several compliments. We found our guests sitting in the family room and just watching the DVD and listening to the soothing and relaxing music. The painting take you to far away places that you would love to visit. Will transform your tv.",1231200000,2,709,4.144927536231884
8130752,5,B000GDIBCA,Alexei Butirskiy has a talent in painting matched by none. To contrast him with Kinkaid is to say he is highly evolved in the realm of painting by the skill he has in making his paintings jump off the page or screen in this instance since it is a DVD.....by his ability to make each piece stand uniquely on its own carrying the presence and certain patina of warmly remembered era gone by. The DVD is a purely calming notion and can be played at first to take in many of Butirskiy's pieces or to have it lovingly played in the background at a holiday party or while you're doing just about anything else.,1188604800,3,604,4.307017543859649
8130753,5,B000GDIBCA,"For those who have not experienced the art of Alexei Butirskiy, you are truly missing out.  This young Russian artist is exceptional!  The DVD is set to perfect background music.",1184889600,3,178,4.9
8130754,5,B000GDIBCA,"We saw this artist's works in Sedona AZ and really liked them.  However the $3000 price tag on our favorite piece was a little steep.  We ran into this DVD online while investigating the artist.  It's a beautiful collection of his works, set to some relaxing music.  We play it on our big screen regularly. It continually loops and is great for company. For $25, you can't beat it.",1178928000,4,381,4.478260869565218
