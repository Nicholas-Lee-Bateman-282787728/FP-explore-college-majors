3841863,5,B0023P7ZSU,"Sadly due to Hurricane Katrina I lost out on the opportunity to see Rob on the Something to Be Tour. But this DVD certainly helps make up for it. I've seen many concert DVD's that were bad but this one is GRADE A. Shot from different angles and the music is crisp and clear, you really must own this. The Red Rocks backdrop is gorgeous! Rob Thomas is simply at his absolute best. You won't regret this purchase.",1246579200,12,411,4.282051282051282

3841865,5,B0023P7ZSU,I went to Red Rocks to see this Rob Thomas concert but this show was in June 2006. This was a great show by Rob Thomas hence why I gave it 5 stars even though the DVD has not been released yet. The film cameras were there at Red Rocks but I could never understand why this concert wasn't released on DVD straight after. Why has it taken 3 years to come out?,1245196800,3,357,3.904109589041096
3841866,5,B0023P7ZSU,I was at this concert when they were filming and it was breathtaking!  I can't wait to see the DVD.,1244937600,4,99,3.95

3841876,5,B0023P7ZSU,"I was at this concert in June 2006 and was SO excited when they told us they were recording it for a DVD. Seemed like forever before it came out on DVD/Blu-Ray, but it was totally worth the wait. Was an amazing show (Jewel go-headlined & I believed Toby Lightman opened. It's too bad they're not on this DVD, too) and it's the perfect souvenir for an unforgettable night. Whether you were there or not for this live performance, this is must have for any true Rob Thomas fan. Professional, clear recordings (both audio & video) that give you a feel for the beautiful brilliance that is Live At Red Rocks. ",1441238400,,605,4.45045045045045
3841877,4,B0023P7ZSU,"I've got the  Sound Stage version of this great performance; no matter how much I loved it , I have to punish the directors of this video, who didn't edit out that lead guitarist! Not only ""steal the thunder"" from Rob, you would have thought the gig was all about him!  ""Quelle Ego""! I think even Rob was a bit ""pissed off "" with him! Otherwise , in every way a great artist ""delivered""! Its worth getting the Blu-ray to witness that loser of a guitarist in action!",1441065600,,465,4.2727272727272725

3841884,5,B0023P7ZSU,"This is an amazing music video. It is fast paced, not much talking, just one song right after another. Rob Thomas works hard to put on an excellent concert. His band is amazing and his voice is awesome. I became a fan just recently and this video made me more of a fan. If you like Rob Thomas, you must see this.",1410307200,,312,4.048387096774194

3841886,1,B0023P7ZSU,Very disappointed with the DVD! Video was ok BUT There was NO audio on the disk whatsoever so it's basically useless to us!,1407456000,,123,4.391304347826087
3841887,5,B0023P7ZSU,"It was great,and I loved how fast it arrived at my home.",1405468800,,56,3.75
3841888,5,B0023P7ZSU,"I am a fan of Rob Thomas and he was going to do a concert in Salina, Kansas. I was searching youtube and came across this. From the first time I saw it I was hooked. The price of the Blu-ray was inexpensive so I had to own it!  The sound is great, the selection of songs is great. I sometimes put this on just to listen to it!",1401235200,,326,3.7246376811594204
3841889,5,B0023P7ZSU,"I love Rob Thomas' voice and so I have collected most anything that he sings on and that it is why I purchased the, Rob Thomas: Something To Be Tour - Live At Red Rocks. Love it!",1400630400,,178,3.8378378378378377
3841890,5,B0023P7ZSU,"Rarely do I see a performer with the personal resonance of Rob Thomas.  As his band plays and sings he closes his eyes, drawing in every individual tone and beat around him and singing.  His vocals are a distinct melody yet they echo with the band's music before, after and throughout.

He is like a fine acoustic 12 string guitar

I've watched it 3 times since purchasing it.

I'd hazard a guess he's a perfectionist, maybe tough to work with.  Or he could be such a sweetheart people do their best work for him!  It takes hard work to make something this good.  YES!  I love it!!!",1397520000,2,582,4.364485981308412
3841891,5,B0023P7ZSU,Very good concert. I love Rob Thomas and this was almost as good as being there!! I watch this over and over.,1395446400,,109,4.0
3841892,2,B0023P7ZSU,"I enjoy listening to Rob Thomas and have several of his hits. Not a huge fan, never seen him in concert. I thought this would be a great compromise. After four songs I felt like I had the gist of the and couldn't take another minute. Don't waste your time.",1394323200,,256,4.14
3841893,5,B0023P7ZSU,"Rob is my favorite male artist and the Red Rock amphitheater is the best locale for a concert.  The picture and sound quality are magnificent, while the song selection is powerful and varied.  Great camera work and the vibe comes through clearly.",1391558400,,246,4.833333333333333
3841894,5,B0023P7ZSU,Excellent experience.  Red rocks is a great venue and Rob performs a terrific mix of his solo and Matchbx 20 work.  Great sound and visual performance.,1387843200,,151,4.769230769230769
3841895,5,B0023P7ZSU,This is as close to being at Red ROCKS as it gets. I feel like I am there in a front row seat. For anyone that is a MB 20fan or RT fan this dvd will blow you away. This is my fav music dvd.,1387584000,,189,3.2222222222222223
3841896,5,B0023P7ZSU,"Rob Thomas wowed me again. He shaved his wispy hair and went solo, but his vocals are strong enough to please anyone! He did a  David Bowie cover that knocked my socks off, it was that good! I love Rob Thomas, he can do no wrong. This was an amazing live performance.",1384819200,,267,4.134615384615385
3841897,5,B0023P7ZSU,I was at this concert and waiting forever for it to come out on DVD. If you have never seen a concert at red rocks I suggest that you do once in your life,1378252800,,154,3.5588235294117645
3841898,5,B0023P7ZSU,"I loved this so much. I got it a few years ago, and I've never stopped enjoying it. The only thing O wish there was less of was shots of the band. There are so many! But overall, this was amazing. Rob always sounds just like the studio version live.

3841899,5,B0023P7ZSU,Arrived on time. Good packaging. I LOVED the show. I'm a huge rob Thomas fan and the DVD did justice to what it's like seeing him live!,1375401600,,135,4.037037037037037
3841900,1,B0023P7ZSU,This is a shame as I am a huge Matchbox Twenty and Rob Thomas Fan. The acoustics at Red Rocks are unmatched. Beware when ordering this. What arrived for me was a scratched dvd with a broken case as if it had been used and returned. The only reason I haven't sent it back is it isn't worth return shipping after spending only 3 or 4 bucks. Graphics are subpar. I can't even say the audio is all that great. Not sure if the blu-ray version would be better quality or not but this is pretty much the quality of a VHS.,1374019200,,514,4.049019607843137
3841901,5,B0023P7ZSU,"Rob Thomas is awesome, and the Red Rocks are beautiful.  The audio and video are flawless.  The mix of songs are great.  I would recommend this Blu-ray to any Rob Thomas and Matchbox Twenty fan.",1367452800,,194,4.485714285714286
3841902,5,B0023P7ZSU,This was an amazing concert.  Rob Thomas is a true musician......love him. The sound quality on Blue-ray was great. I definitely recommend it.,1365206400,,142,5.173913043478261
3841903,5,B0023P7ZSU,"I bought this DVD a few years ago and it still holds up. I saw Rob Thomas a few years after seeing this DVD and I think that it captures the atmosphere and talent of his shows. There are not many venues that are as storied as the Red Rocks, so this was a great choice of venue to record for home video by Rob Thomas. While there are a couple songs I would've liked to hear on the live DVD (mostly his Matchbox 20 stuff - can't really complain that it's not on there), he plays almost all of his solo work. Can't really complain about this one!",1364860800,,543,3.9908256880733943
3841904,5,B0023P7ZSU,"Rob Thomas gives an amazing performance.  The production was very good as well.  I had seen the PBS soundstage broadcast of this DVD an is what provoked me to purchase this.  Only complaint is they left ""how far we've come"" and a bit of rob thomas speaking between songs off the DVD production that was on the PBS airing.",1357603200,,321,4.406779661016949
3841905,5,B0023P7ZSU,"After seeing parts of this concert on YouTube I had to get the DVD.  Fantastic!  I felt like I was there.  Of course, I'm a die hard Rob Thomas fan so I would have been thrilled if he just sang the alphabet.  I also got the Something to Be CD which contains most of the songs that he sang at Red Rocks.  If any of you Rob Thomas fans haven't gotten this DVD don't put it off - you'll enjoy it & love it as much as I do.",1347235200,5,419,3.662921348314607
3841906,5,B0023P7ZSU,"I've watched it a dozen times. Great quality on blu-ray and great songs. Red Rock is amazing too. If you like Rob Thomas, you'll love this disc.",1343952000,,144,4.37037037037037
3841907,5,B0023P7ZSU,"my wife and I have enjoyed Matchbox 20 for years and with Rob Thomas doing his solo thing its just a great add to the library.
The package arrived as described! brand new in original plastics.
Quality of shipping was great and fast.
We would by again from this seller",1336348800,3,267,4.36
3841908,5,B0023P7ZSU,This live concert by Rob Thomas is just great!!  If you are a Rob Thomas fan it is a MUST HAVE!!!  You can feel like you are at his live concert any time you want.  He's awesome as always!!!,1330819200,,190,3.8205128205128207
3841909,2,B0023P7ZSU,"Distressed!1 Disappointed?!!  I did not know that BluRay discs had various world codes and that America & Australia consequently were not in the same code region..... so I'm a sad sack because I can't even play it on my Aussie devices...............but had opened the box, so probably can't return it, and am desperate to have it, so have sent for a DVD now.  More cost.  ARRGH!!",1310256000,,379,4.712121212121212
3841910,5,B0023P7ZSU,"Purchased this blu-ray to add to my blu-ray concert collection. It is excellent. Great song selection. One of my favorites is the cover of Lets Dance. If you like Rob Thomas, you should enjoy this!",1300838400,,197,4.6571428571428575
3841911,5,B0023P7ZSU,"I also bought ""A Night in the Life of Matchbox 20"".  I viewed it first, which elevated my respect for Rob Thomas.  I then popped in this DVD and was blown away by an even more inspired performance.  After these two videos, I'm going to head to a live concert if the opportunity arises.",1289347200,,285,4.2407407407407405
3841912,5,B0023P7ZSU,"I bought one as a gift, and one for myself.  I enjoy this because I am a Rob Thomas fan, ans this video shows his talent well.",1286064000,,126,3.6666666666666665

3841914,5,B0023P7ZSU,"[...]

I listen to it all, well not the crap music, all these spoiled pop stars should be executed for the crimes they've committed against the ART... Anyway....This is real music people!! I have no idea what the other retard was talking about.. Rob being pale and what not, WTF?!! This is a MUSIC DVD!! The guy can straight up sing, if you weren't aware of that already... Not only that he also plays a number of different instruments during the show, his band looks pumped, and they own the crowd with every single performance. This DVD is OUTSTANDING! If your a Matchbox 20 fan you will love this DVD and for 17 dollars on Blu Ray it's a steal! I'm not going to get into the specifics of individual things, just go to [...] and type in ""Rob Thomas Red Rocks"" and see for yourself. It's clear that there a lot of people in this world who just have no taste in anything; music, culture, clothing, etc... I'm sure the previous reviewer is one of those people, one of those robots. I mean how superficial can you be, ""he was pale""... An opinion, a statement like that just makes clear why there should be laws against simple minded people's allowance to reproduce, let alone leave reviews on Amazon...

Get it and enjoy, I put it in daily and get random stuff done around the house just listening to the music... This was much better than the John Mayer DVD, which was good, the acoustic set in the beginning was great, but nothing like what Rob brings throughout this entire concert. This is a right up there with Peal Jam's ""Immagine in Cornice""... My personal opinion of-course...  :)",1262649600,2,1586,4.5
3841915,5,B0023P7ZSU,"If you are a Matchbox Twenty fan or just simply a fan of Rob Thomas this is a must have for your collection.  This is an awesome show, wish I could have been there, but having this concert on DVD is the next best thing. Buy this - you won't be disappointed!!!",1262044800,6,259,3.980769230769231
3841916,2,B0023P7ZSU,"The concert, captured as a Soundstage production, exhibits the expected video and sound quality from the bluray disk.  No complaints there.  I just didn't like it.  Not nearly as good as the Matchbox Twenty Soundstage concert I have seen on cable.  Rob looks old and pale and I'm just not impressed with the songs presented.  I'm not really a big fan of Rob's solo work as much as his Matchbox Twenty stuff, but he does some of both.  The best song on the disk is a David Bowie cover.  I doubt I will watch it again, whereas the Matchbox Twenty show I have watched many times on my DVR and still enjoy that immensely.",1252713600,4,617,4.359649122807017
