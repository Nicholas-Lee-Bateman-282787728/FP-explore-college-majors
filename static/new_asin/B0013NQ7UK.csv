3118749,5,B0013NQ7UK,"WOW!  I got to see the English countryside where many of these elaborate crop circles have appeared, so close to Stonehenge, the White Horse, observatories -- fantastic, just amazing!  and makes you wonder why there?  Is there a message?  Who ""made"" these pattern?  All i can say is that it's lasered precision ""artwork with a message"".  How can a group of humans make such perfect design in matter of minutes -- i don't think they can (humans make messy ones)?  See for yourself.

Along with great videography, will accompany melody with clear resonating voices throughout the hour or so long video.  There are also interviews with many researchers and experts in this area -- very enlightening.

Another reviewer from Dublin (G.Murchu) expressed exactly what i thought; i agree:  you will thoroughly enjoy this time after time!

I saw Patty Greer on a PBS interview program & immediately ordered her DVD.  The DVD  has been enlightening, interesting & well presented.  It has reopened my interest in Crop Circles & I am amazed at how intricate & beautiful they have become.

Buy this DVD!!! You will be pleased!!!!!",1246233600,3,478,4.5
3118751,5,B0013NQ7UK,"If you are interested in crop circles you will be enthralled with this  film.  Even if you know nothing about crop circles you will enjoy the elaborate three dimensional geometric patterns of great beauty appearing mysteriously in the cornfields of Southern England.  They usually are seen near ancient sites such as Avebury and Stonehenge.  This DVD captures the beauty and the mystery of these temporary temples which appear suddenly and last until the cutting of the corn.
Every aspect of the crop circle phenomenon is explored by the various contributors to this DVD. Their enthusiasm is infectious. Patti gives a poetic description in her melodious voice. The accompaning music and sound effects add to the magic of the theme and the photography is brilliant.  A very large number of crop circles are shown in brilliant technicolour.  For anyone interested in crop circles this is a film to be enjoyed again and again.  I have shown it to a group of friends who have enjoyed it as much as I did.  I recommend it highly.",1218758400,9,1024,4.844827586206897

  ""As you know, I have read a number of books on crop circles and seen most of the highly recommended films on the subject, of which ""THE WAKE UP CALL ~ ANYBODY LISTENING?"" is the best.
  Having attended the 2005 Crop Circle Symposium in Glastonbury, England and visited first hand numerous crop circles, and listened to many authorities lecture on this phenomena, I have two conclusions.
  First, I believe that anyone who looks into the crop circle phenomena with an open mind will be convinced that they are manifestations of some intelligence or power beyond human capability.  The claims that these majestic mandalas in the fields are man made are beyond absurd in the face of the documented evidence and personal testimonies to the contrary.  Which leads to my second conclusion:
  ""The Wake Up Call, Anybody Listening?"" is by far the best documentary film on crop circles to date.  Kudos to you, Patty Greer, for making the most informative, inspiring and beautifully crafted movie on this mind blowing subject of crop circles.
 Sincerely,
Jack Groverland",1202428800,18,1128,5.037837837837838
