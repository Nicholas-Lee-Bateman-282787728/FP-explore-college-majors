8185484,3,B000MTKALI,"Little bit redundant, if you are looking for action and or hunting techniques and eduacation this isn't the show for you. I love Ted but the content of this video was not very impressive.  Could have been done better. Could have shown more about Ted's hunting techniques, locations and wildlife stewardship.  Dont get me wrong Id love to have Ted over to my farm for a hunt.",1424304000,,374,4.567164179104478
