7979062,4,B000083C88,"I own many ""SI"" swimsuit magazines and videos. Some were stolen, but ""amazon.com"" is helping me to replace them. Of the many models on this 2003 ""SI"" swimsuit video, Audrey Quock, Yamila Diaz-Rahi and Marisa Miller are my favorites. Melissa Keller, Petra Nemcova and Ana Beatriz Barros are attractive too. I'm not a fan of hostess Rachel Hunter, but many men like her looks. 5'-7"" Spanish-Lebanese Yamila was better in 2002 when she was the covergirl. 5'-8"", 110 lbs. Italian Marisa is better in 2004 (Bertetta is her birth surname, her husbands were Jim Miller and Chris Guest). Asian Audrey Quock is consistent in several videos, and I always love seeing her. The 2002 and 1989 ""SI"" swimsuit videos are my favorites, but this one is worth owning too.",1316044800,,752,4.837209302325581
