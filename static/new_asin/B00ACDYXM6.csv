The DVD itself is listed as being in Swedish with Italian subtitles.  This is not entirely accurate.  Most of the dialogue is by Liv Ullmann and is in English.  The  film clips from Bergman and Ullmann films are in Swedish, but that's not really a problem if you've already seen the films with English subtitles and understand what's going on. I suspect most viewers of this DVD are already familiar with their films.

The film  itself is Liv Ullmann's reminiscences about her personal and professional relationship with Ingmar Bergman.  It provides insights on Bergman as both a person and a director.  As such, it's a must have for followers of Bergman and Ullmann.  Other viewers may appreciate the cinematography, music, and pure beauty of the film, but may not appreciate the film's personal and sensitive story.",1393977600,5,934,4.8544303797468356
