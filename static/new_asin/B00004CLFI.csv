1338964,5,B00004CLFI,"I feel fortunate that I videotaped this movie back when Lifetime aired it 20 years ago. I watch it every year at Christmastime and yes, I cry too. Patty Duke and Stephen Dorff are outstanding - in fact the entire cast turns out stunning emotional performances. Jarred Blancard as Greg's brother John is exceptionally believable in this role, and Richard Masur as Greg's father also inspires the viewers' empathy. I've often wondered what this film would be like if it ended differently, if Greg revealed himself personally to his birth parents, and I think this is one of the things that keeps me coming back to this film, it could end in any number of ways. In fact the ending is a kind of beginning for both families. It would be wonderful for this film to come out on DVD. I could even see room for production of a sequel.",1292889600,19,825,4.506666666666667
1338965,5,B00004CLFI,I remember this wonderful movie dating to 1990.  I've tried to find it on DVD or VHS with no success.  It brought tears of happiness back in 1990 when it was shown on television.  I would love to have the DVD version for my library.,1289606400,13,232,4.111111111111111
1338966,5,B00004CLFI,"It is interesting to note and read the five glowing reviews.  I agree with them regarding the quality of the movie.  There is conflict, resolution and reconciliation.  The effect on families I know who have seen this movie is very positive.

Why is it not available on DVD?  It should be.  It sounds as if each reviewer would recommend and buy at least one copy and most probably more for gifts.  I would and I think it would be a successful DVD.  Whoever owns the rights to the movie should be aware of this.",1274832000,24,509,4.340425531914893
1338967,5,B00004CLFI,"Patty Duke has done many high quality works, but none is better than her performance in ""Always Remember I Love You.""  Of course, the acting by the other actors -- especially Stephen Dorff -- is exceptional as well, and the story itself is really great.

When is this movie going to be put on DVD?",1259452800,19,297,4.381818181818182
1338968,5,B00004CLFI,"Whenever I'd come across ""Always Remember I Love You"" being shown on tv, I'd watch it, it's that good a film.  It's sadly been many years since I last watched it and I still miss it and look for it.  It's a wonderful, heartwarming film with a terrific cast and a great ending.  So many other Lifetime holiday movies are available on DVD, I wish this one was too, I'd buy it.",1237852800,16,374,4.166666666666667
1338969,5,B00004CLFI,"This is a ""FABULOUS"" movie. It's so full of emotion and love. Anna (Patty) Duke does a perfect job in this film. So many people are waiting for this film to come out on DVD, I don't understand why it's not available.  Frank  jerseycityfrank2004@yahoo.com  Can someone email me if they know where to find it on dvd?  Thank you !!!",1236988800,21,329,4.433333333333334
1338970,5,B00004CLFI,This is the best movie!  It is a family tradition at Christmas time.  I bawl every time I watch this movie.  This needs to come out on DVD!,1166832000,37,139,3.892857142857143
1338971,5,B00004CLFI,"This movie is the story of a young man and his search for his real family. When his adopted parents are horrified to discover that Robert was stolen from his birth parents, they feel it is their obligation to tell him what they have found out. Hurt and confused he leaves home in search for his biological parents. What he finds is a family that is still hurting over the loss of their son many years after the fact. Trying to get close to his newly found family without telling them exactly who he is, Robert finds that the line between family isn't as clear cut as he previously thought.

This was originally a made-for-television movie, broadcast shortly before Christmas in 1990. That said, this movie has as much heart as any family film you could find in theatres. Star Stephen Dorff shows a real range for (17 years old at the time) such a young actor. And tv/movie legend Patty Duke pulls out all stops in portraying an emotionally scarred mother who tries to pull her family together dispite the empty spot still left behind by her missing son. Though it can definately be classified as a ""Lifetime Movie"", I can't express enough how wonderful this movie is. It shows so many facets of family life and how one can find a niche in their own if they only look to try.",1133222400,53,1274,4.467811158798283

1338973,5,B00004CLFI,I positively LOVE this movie and had the opportunity to tell Patty Duke that in person when she did a special screening of Valley of the Dolls at the Music Box theater in Chicago a couple of years ago.  She was so charming and appreciated the fact I commented on Always Remember I Love You.  She has very fond memories of working with all of the great actors/actresses in the movie.  Please release this on DVD for my collection.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on this wonderful and heartfelt movie.,1380585600,9,520,4.5
1338974,5,B00004CLFI,This is such a great movie and my vhs copy is disappearing before my eyes.  How could they not come out with a DVD version when they constantly bring out much lesser movies on DVD.  Great acting and the story touches everyone's heart.,1354406400,3,234,4.4186046511627906
1338975,5,B00004CLFI,Seen this movie twice on tv and it's a masterpiece. So human and so appropriate for people that may deal with the adoption issue. Let's have a DVD release,1341100800,4,154,4.344827586206897
1338976,5,B00004CLFI,I luckily made a VHS tape of this Lifetime Movie years ago and just rewatched it today.  I've discovered the quality of the tape has suffered over the years and would sure like to have it available in DVD format.  Any chance????,1339113600,3,228,4.404761904761905
1338977,4,B00004CLFI,"I saw it several times on Lifetime and recorded it at the fastest speed for the best quality back in the VHS days, and, like so many here, would love to have it on DVD.  May try to transfer it to DVD myself one of these days, since I never watch VHS anymore.  It's one of my favorite Stephen Dorff movies and it almost always makes me cry at the end as Patty Duke reads the letter he has left her.  I have a few other favorite Lifetime movies that I would love to buy on DVD and wish they could have released a line of ""The Best of Lifetime"" to the public.  This is a wonderful and heart-warming movie and I happen to be a man in his late 60s.",1332028800,8,643,3.885496183206107
1338978,5,B00004CLFI,"I was just on You-Tube, and someone put it there in seven (7) parts.  It's a rip of an old VHS copy, and seems to be in pretty good condition (and complete).  I made a copy for myself, since you never know when someone is going to take things off.  I was going to have my girlfriend copy it off the TV, and thought I would take a look on You-Tube and see if it mentioned it.  I hope this helps someone out.",1323561600,11,406,3.855421686746988
1338979,5,B00004CLFI,"I agree with every comment on this page.  I am a 57 year old man and I find this movie one of the most touching I have ever seen.  I get a lump in my throat as Patty Duke reads her son's letter at the end of the movie everytime.  I too hope this comes out on DVD soon, my VHS copy from TV is wearing out.",1322784000,7,304,3.5074626865671643
1338980,5,B00004CLFI,This was one of my husbands favorite Christmas movies! We had is on tape but lost is during a move. We looked for it everywhere last year because my husband was ill.

7919772,5,B00004CLFI,"This movie ""Always Remember I Love You"" should have been on dvd by now. It is a wonderfully sentimental story especially poignant at Christmas time. Every year I look for it to be played on the LIFETIME movie channel but never see it advertised. The movie was recorded for me many years ago on VHS but also includes all of the commercials in between. At least I am able to see it there.",1446768000,,386,4.301369863013699

7919774,5,B00004CLFI,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  You, definitely, need to put it on DVD and have plenty of copies available.  I would buy it in a second.  I saw it years ago, and have never forgotten it.  Every time that I see any of the cast on TV movies----I think of this movie.

7919776,5,B00004CLFI,"Just a great loving story a real tear jerker.
The only thing I didn't like the ending, He should have told her and the family who he really was.
And why isn't this great movie on DVD, I have been trying to get a copy of it for a long time, because
I have wanted to show this great movie to family and friends.
This movie would be a great movie for todays young people to see.
