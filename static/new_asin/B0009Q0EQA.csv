8065274,1,B0009Q0EQA,"This little video was stunningly animated, and the score was well done. The producers tried real hard to make it hip and fresh. But it was a very poor film. The bible story wasn't just watered down it was butchered. They had the boat almost sink twice, and nothing for one of the animals to eat. I found it on sale for $3. It was neither worth a penny, nor the space it takes on a shelf.",1262995200,,387,4.038961038961039
8065275,1,B0009Q0EQA,"Like mentioned in another review, the animation/story was very generic.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Not even a rental.",1214265600,2,126,5.3
8065276,5,B0009Q0EQA,"I like these guys and I like their work, as far as the hurricane deal goes read this:

""Barry recalls his drama of making ""Don't Miss the Boat."" ""It's so ironic,"" he says. ""We're doing our first movie about the biggest storm in history and what happens down here? We got hit by four hurricanes, and we were under a strict deadline. We'd have to break down all the computers and shut everything off.  It was an absolute nightmare.""""",1181001600,,431,4.443037974683544
8065277,5,B0009Q0EQA,"The animation in this new twist to an old story will leave one awestruck.  The talent and dedication of this animation team rivals the likes of Pixar and Pacific Data Imaging.  Check out the character motions, the background detail, the ominous coming of the storm, and the pan-out of the ark near the end. The music by Michael McDonald (remember the Doobie Brothers?) and the beautiful chart-topping Christian artist, Natalie Grant, is superb, especially her rendition of ""There is a Rainbow"".  Don't be fooled by other reviewers with a one-track, 'everything is offensive' mind, who can't spell 'hurricane'.  Let your children decide for themsleves what is entertaining and wholesome, and what is offensive.  The Roach Approach Series would be a great Christmas gift for a child you love.  It may teach them a great deal about love of family, steadfastness, devotion, tolerance, honesty, and faith in God.",1129248000,7,907,5.136054421768708
8065278,1,B0009Q0EQA,"I ordered this, hoping to show it to kids at my Episcopal church.  Thank goodness I previewed it.  As the roaches set up the story of Noah's ark, they are worried about an approaching hurricaine.  One tells the other not to worry as hurricaines are ""just God's way of clearing away the things we don't need.""  Is this really what the creators of this video believe?  In light of the suffering caused by Katrina, the callousness of this sentiment takes my breath away.",1129075200,2,467,4.578313253012048
