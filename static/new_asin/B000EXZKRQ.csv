8115650,4,B000EXZKRQ,"Jim Backus provided the voice for the beloved Uncle Magoo animated character. Uncle Sam Magoo travels back in time and history from the Pilgrims and Indians' first Thanksgiving to the landing on the moon. Uncle Sam Magoo meets Christopher Columbus as he discovers America. He also meets and interacts with Paul Revere, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Francis Scott Key, Betsy Ross and others. This DVD is a fine instrument in teaching American history to younger viewers.

The only downside to this DVD is the lack of special features. They should have added something other than the 53 minutes of Mr. Magoo's patriotic special episode. They have a nice touching tribute at the end from historical American figures like Carl Sandburg, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and President John F. Kennedy.",1506816000,,798,5.186046511627907

8115653,2,B000EXZKRQ,"After watching a Magoo short tacked onto our Mr. Magoo's A Christmas Carol disk, my kids were in love with Mr. Magoo!  I shied away from the box-set because reviews complained of censorship that ruined their nostalgia surrounding the cartoon, so I purchased several of these titles, not realizing they were a re-made series from the 70s.  Unfortunately, not funny...not clever...not sharp like the original series.  Boo.  Disappointing!!!",1265414400,3,438,5.397058823529412

8115655,3,B000EXZKRQ,"Mr. Magoo has had a lengthy career from theatrical cartoons in the 1940s and 50s to three different TV series: ""Mr. Magoo"" (1960), ""The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo"" (1964) and ""What's New, Mr. Magoo"" (1977). There was also a theatrical animated feature ""1001 Arabian Nights"" (1959) and a lousy live action film starring Leslie Nielsen. Sandwiched between all of this were a couple of primetime TV specials, one which is excellent ""Magoo's Christmas Carol"" (1962) and one not so excellent ""Uncle Sam Magoo""  (1970). The only thing going for it is it is the last new Magoo show to be produced by UPA (""What's New, Mr. Magoo"" was produced by DePatie-Freleng). The biggest problem with it is, although somewhat historical, it is also quite boring. The best moments are at the beginning when Magoo is arriving at the UPA studios. As usual, Jim Backus voices, but it is not enough to perk up the proceedings. Check out ""Magoo's Christmas Carol"" instead.",1210550400,6,950,4.864197530864198
8115656,5,B000EXZKRQ,"Clear, bright graphics, it looks like it's been restored.  Using the same gimmick as ""Magoo's Christmas Carol,"" Mr. Magoo is doing a stage show as Uncle Sam.  The show is amazingly detailed, starting with the Vikings, and continuing through Columbus, and eventually the English coming to America.  Using songs, we are led through the settling of America, the wars we fought in, famous Americans, and even the Industrial Revolution.  Surprisingly, it does not sugar-coat history, covering the slaughter of the buffalo, the Civil War, and the sorrow of the Native Americans at our ""progress.""  Even though they brought in Paul Bunyan, they were careful to identify him as a fictional character.  One or two characters (like Johnny Appleseed) were a little over the top, presumably to keep the kids entertained.  Altogether an enjoyable, educational cartoon that should be brought out on American holidays like Independence Day, and not allowed to disappear.  On par with ""Scholastic Rock"" offerings.",1189382400,5,997,5.305732484076433
