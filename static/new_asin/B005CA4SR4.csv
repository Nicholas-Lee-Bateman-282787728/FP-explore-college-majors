4652070,1,B005CA4SR4,"The opening features Kevin Spacey as an infomercial huckster, with the most perfect gestures and all the trimmings. Hilarious. Then we flip forward to his release from prison where he was serving time for ""depraved indifference""--which isn't an actual thing--it applies to homicides, not the loss of fingers in a mechanism (an ab-cruncher/TV channel changer--the products are all these hybrids--and a couple were mildly amusing, but then..). The implausibility goes from there. His ex-wife is played to Botoxed excess by Virginia Madsen, whose new beau is Craig Robinson from The Office--who is tolerably funny. His do-gooder daughter is woodenly played by Camilla Belle. She lives with two roommates, one of whom is some kind of truly nasty, snarky lesbian unbearably impersonated by Heather Graham. He gets a job at Family Mart (more Kmart than Walmart) with a boss who fires him when the boss *hilariously8 [not] slips on a puddle of mop water left by Spacey, and tumbles into a pile of plastic coolers. ha ha.  We gave up after 30 minutes--or a third of the way in. Oy!

4652071,5,B005CA4SR4,"Wow.  I'm the 20th person to review on this movie on Amazon.com and I feel like they must have sent me a different film than the one everyone else got!  I think ""Father of Invention"" is a wonderful movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was interested in the cast, the concept, as well as the challenge of balancing the drama and the humor.

Its been a long time since I saw a movie where I thought every actor was perfectly cast, and all of them contributed to the story.  First, Kevin Spacey who has made a very successful career out of playing complex, imperfect, and unpredictable odd balls.  In the extras, the producers tell about how they sent the script to Spacey hoping he'd like it.  It would seem to me that once Kevin Spacey read a role like Robert Axel, he would have absolutely no choice but to take it.  He was so many things throughout the movie.  From homeless bum and worthless ex-con, to mighty entrepreneur, from ambitious pitch man, to sensitive friend, from heartless father, to self-aware dad.  He did it all in this film, and it was all very worthy.

Every cast member did a nice job conveying the humor in the movie.  I've always enjoyed ""Arrested Development,"" and there was alot of humor of that kind throughout the movie.  The direction seemed to find a comfortable home in the humor, and perhaps this is not surprising given that several of the other cast members are brilliant comedians, including Johnny Knoxville and Craig Robinson.  I thought the direction matched the casting perfectly because it seemed like everyone was well matched to their roles.  Even Camilla Belle, who had the most dramatic responsibility as the neglected daughter, was able to add bits of humor when called upon.

Another nice thing about ""Father of Invention"" is its ""mockumentary"" characteristics.  I am a big fan of Christopher Guest movies which affectionately ridicule the target subject matter in the context of humor and satire.  Unlike Guest's movies however, this film has a very powerful element of drama and personal failure.  Yet I think it very successfully mocks the gadget/fad/exercise machine/""but wait..."" industry, while also trying to demonstrate Robert Axel's interest not just to make money, but also to come up with something great that will help people.

I realize that the premise of the movie is that the main character, Robert Axel, takes himself too seriously.  Yet from the moment he steps out of prison, it is clear that this character, who has hit rock bottom, no longer suffers from this problem.  Not that his moral compass has found its way yet (and really doesn't until the end of the movie).  But we come to find that no one really takes themselves to seriously in this cast of characters, so there is plenty of space for odd and supportive friendships to take hold.

""Father of Invention"" has a number of entertaining scenes where people are very honest with, and do nice things for each other.  Robert Axel is able to get help from three friends from the old days who help him launch his new (and very silly - like all the products, most notably, the ""Ab Clicker"") idea.  Robert Axel comes through for one of his daughters room mates - twice - in two very touching scenes with Spacey and Heather Graham.  Axel seems to forgive everyone from his past, including his wife and her new husband, even though almost no one is willing to forgive him.

Basically, I love the ambiguity and untidiness of this movie.  I'm tired of all the cheap, commercial schlock that de-humanizes and pollutes most of the movies produced for public consumption today.  In one of the scenes with Robert Axel and another of his daughters room mates, he explains (from experience) how ""fathers are human too"" and they can be failures and so much less than they should be.  This was one of several rare moments of honesty, like when Axel and Heather Graham's character are driving away from a confrontation with her boyfriend and he tells her she is a very strong and attractive person, and she cries.  He goes on to say, ""I never cheated on my wife.... I cheated on my wife with my job.""  This explains why he is never too angry with his wife for spending $382 million of his money, or getting re-married, etc., because he knows it was his own fault.

Robert Axel seems to take responsibility for this failures, and this made him a much more attractive character than he could have been.  The scene where he finds an ""ab clicker"" and immediately hauls it out to the street to destroy it in a fit of nervous anger, shows just how bitter he is at what happened with that device.  ""I should have tested it more,"" he says to his engineer.

Another problem I have with most movies today but not this one, is the failure to be consistent with script, character development and directing.  In ""Father of Invention,"" I thought the plot and the behaviors of the characters - even the odd idiosyncrasies - seemed to make sense, and the ending of the movie, even though it came too early, was a reasonable ending and it tied up the relationships between the main characters nicely.

So unlike the other 95% of reviewers, I highly recommend ""Father of Invention,"" for everybody - Spacey fans, fans of great humor a la ""Arrested Development,"" fans of any of the other actors (who all got great roles except perhaps for John Stamos), fans of infomercials and direct TV advertising, and fans of honest, alternative presentation in modern cinema.

And for the rest of you, pay closer attention and look carefully.  There is some wonderful action and writing on this screen!",1320537600,,5573,4.691358024691358
4652072,4,B005CA4SR4,".

This film has some humorous scenes but is not much of a comedy,  it is more of a social commentary.  Father of Invention tells a tale of ego struggle.  Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey), is a successful ""inventor"" who markets unique products that sell billions in profit.  He is sued over a product that injures people, spends eight years in prison, and returns to rebuild his life.  While Robert is in prison, his company remakes itself in another image, his wife (Virginia Madsen  divorces him, his daughter (Camilla Belle) feels he abandoned her, and he is forced to begin again with zero resources.

Robert cons his daughter into staying in her apartment while he begins a new job.
Claire's roommates Phoebe (Heather Graham), and Donna (Anna Anissimova) dislike Robert and regularly harass him.

Robert Axle is a troubled man.  His focus has been on his job and making money.  He doesn't think he has a problem.  His wife and daughter disagree.  His employees disagree.  When Robert has trouble he blames others.  The thousands of people who were hurt by his invention, didn't use it correctly - they put their fingers in stupid places.  His wife and daughter drifting away from him have a problem in his eyes, not him.

When a person is in trouble, blames other people and fails to see his own responsibility for his struggle, what does it take for him to admit he even has a problem?  How does he overcome denial?  How does he discover that he must focus upon his own behavior?  This movie provides a beginning of an answer to such questions.

Father of Invention is a decent movie.  It has several very funny scenes, but is not really a comedy.  This film is really a movie about accepting life and relationships.  I recommend this movie for those interested in self help films.",1320537600,3,1781,4.670967741935484
4652073,3,B005CA4SR4,"Let me begin by saying that I am a huge Kevin Spacey fan, and I have seen virtually all of his films.  I have often enjoyed even his lower profile independent projects such as ""The Big Kahuna.""  This movie had a lot going for it, but sadly--even with the great Spacey at the helm--it fell a little flat for me.  This might have worked as a straight-up parody of informercial mania and the country's obsession with unnecessary gadgets.  Instead we have a fairly generic dramedy that tries too hard to be a heartwarming story of redemption as a workaholic discovers the importance of family.

At under 90 minutes, ""Father of Invention"" simply does not have room for such an extraordinary supporting cast, most of whom pop in and out (such as John Stamos' slightly extended cameo) and add virtually nothing to the narrative.  Heather Graham is somewhat interesting as an angry, confused lesbian with an odd fascination with her own breasts, but her romantic subplot fizzles out with no resolution.  Craig Robinson (""The Office"") is his usual funny self, but he has nothing to do until the end credits.  This is Kevin Spacey's film from start to finish, and there's nothing wrong with that.  The problem lies with a story that's too short, with too many characters, that ignores its comic potential to become a cloying tearjerker that the audience just does not care about.

All that aside, I will say that my wife totally bought the family-redemption narrative and was in tears towards the end.  I was almost in tears for a very different reason.  Great actors should be forgiven for making occasionally bad films.  In this case, it's just sad to see a story with such potential fall so very flat.  I give the film two stars, and my wife gives it four.  We'll call it an even three and probably never watch it again.",1320451200,,1813,4.6750788643533125
4652074,3,B005CA4SR4,"Father of Invention is a typical film of father/daughter angst in the everyday life of a dysfunctional family. What makes this one special for me, is the ever amazing performance of Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, Superman  Returns). No matter what his roles - he seems to make them his own and in a way that you either love his characters or you hate them. Playing Robert Axel and inventor of junk products who lead a billion dollar company only to be sued into prison for not labeling the safety issues on a stomach stretcher - he is left with nothing. His ex-wife went on to splurge her half of his millions (played by an energetic, but a little loony Virginia Madsen (Fraiser, Monk  leaving him flat broke after eight years in prison and separated from his now extremely independent daughter played by Camilla Bell (The Patriot. Push). His daughter doesn't understand his pain and repentance and he doesn't understand he independence and lack of interest in keeping in touch with her father the criminal.

The movie starts of really slow and with little more than fake commercials and typical one-liners about a billionaire being slapped down and sent to prison...however a little more than halfway through Kevin begins to shine and his character changes his goals and persona all for the love of his daughter. This movie was directed by Trent Cooper (Larry The Cable Guy) and does have the low budget `feel' to it - but it has a big heart by the end. The movie is off a little in its beets of comedy and dram but moves consistently. There are some great funny moments with a lesbian roommate played by Heather Graham (Bowfinger, Austin Powers, Scrubs) and the new husband of his ex played by Craig Robinson (The Office, Cleveland Show). There's even a cameo from John Stamos (Full House, Glee) - who motivates Kevin even further in a very funny way.

It would be a great family film and some sensitive issues about priorities with family, ambition and work are definitely dealt with in this film. Overall a great showcase of light drama and comedy. Definately a good movie for video. 10-11.",1320364800,,2115,4.723577235772358
4652075,4,B005CA4SR4,"I like Kevin Spacey and I try to see everything he's in and this is not the usual film for him.

He plays one of those awful infomercial type guys fresh out of prison,after serving 8 years for one of his products (some good laughs in this) injuring people. He's trying to start life again and re-establish a relationship with his daughter.

The cast is really good,Heather Graham is very funny as the angry lesbian roommate of Spacey's daughter,""Face or Nuts?"" and I also enjoyed Johnny Knoxville's acting in this.

I thought it was a well made film and I enjoyed it very much with many solid laughs.",1320364800,,600,4.537037037037037
4652076,1,B005CA4SR4,"This movie suffers from what I call ""confused tone"".  The movie starts off feeling like an over the top comedy.  You can't take the movie seriously when the set up is ridiculous - Spacey, a successful, wealthy, entrepreneur, loses everything when a product of his kills someone. This is just dumb, since he would have product liability insurance, not to mention a company which protects you from losing your personal money...So, the initial assumption is this is just a spoof and the plot and characters are not meant to be taken seriously.  But the movie quickly veers into an oh so unoriginal white male redemption story, as Spacey (now poor and penniless) tries to reconnect with his daughter who abhors him.  It's unclear if the intent is to take the character seriously, or laugh at him (although nothing is very funny in the film). Daughter takes pity on Spacey, and their relationship is on the mend (yawn).  The movie is neither funny, entertaining, or poignant and it is quite painful to watch.  Can someone in Hollywood please write a movie that doesn't involve white male redemption and/or actually has a plot?",1320364800,2,1121,4.842931937172775
4652077,5,B005CA4SR4,"This movie review is part of my obligation to Amazon for accepting to be a member of the Vine program, a club of selected customers that provide opinions about ""new and pre-released items."" We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.

Because we are Kevin Spacey fans, the minute we saw this item come up on the Vine monthly newsletter, we decided to accept it and watched it as soon as it arrived.

We have to admit the plot was not what we expected or are accustomed to receiving from the actor. Kevin Spacey performs a character named Robert Axle, who transforms right before our eyes from a self-centered and arrogant business success to a convicted felon and back as a father who wants to redeem past transgressions where he abandoned his only daughter in search for multi-million profit earnings.

Why does he end up in jail?

Because of defective products and it is rather funny to see how he is able to recognize his former clients by the consequences of having acquired his products. We will not reveal all movie details to allow viewers to enjoy the film.

The role of his daughter is played by Camilla Belle, who does an excellent job as the relationship gets back on track.

The movie takes us through the difficulties of a man who loses it all trying to regain business status. With so many corporate giants going down lately, the movie becomes plausible if not a lesson on why corporate greed destroys those who forget what life is all about.

Different but enjoyable.",1320278400,,1541,4.622710622710622
4652078,3,B005CA4SR4,"""Haven't you ruined enough peoples lives?"" Robert Axel (Spacey) is the world's greatest ""fabricator"". Combining two ideas into one new one makes him millions. When one idea, the ""ab-clicker"" (an ab machine/TV remote) breaks peoples fingers he is found liable and is sent to prison. After serving 8 years he is released and moves in with his daughter and two roommates. Kevin Spacey has started to make a living playing offbeat, somewhat eccentric characters that have to build themselves back up. While this performance is not quite as good as ""Casino Jack"" it is still very good, and the movie is too. A very funny and enjoyable movie to watch. While not very original it is still very entertaining and Spacey's interaction with the other characters is what makes the movie. The supporting cast which includes Heather Graham, Johnny Knoxville and Craig Robinson are great and while the movie is a rehash of many other movies the acting and dialog make this well worth watching. Overall, a very entertaining movie that is only that way because of the cast. I give it a B.

4652079,3,B005CA4SR4,"FATHER OF INVENTION is a pleasant, but unexceptional, comedy that benefits greatly from the lead performance of Kevin Spacey.

At one time, eccentric inventor and infomercial guru Robert Axle (Spacey) was on top of the world.  Television viewers were gobbling up his unusual ""fabrications,"" until one of them went very wrong and people were maimed.  Axle lost his family, his vast fortune and went to prison for eight years.

Now, Axle is back outside and he's not only looking for a new idea that will put him back on top, but also trying to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter (Camilla Belle).

The screenplay by director Trent Cooper and Jonathan D. Crane has some fun moments, particularly in the sequences dealing with Axle's business pursuits, but the personal relationships and secondary characters in the story are, in many instances, poorly defined and lack believability.  And, the film's predictable ending seems to fall flat.

Heather Graham shines in the supporting cast, playing the angry ""lesbian"" roommate of Axle's daughter.  Also in the cast are Johnny Knoxville, John Stamos, Craig Robinson and Virginia Madsen.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a ""Making of"" featurette.

4652147,3,B005CA4SR4,"I found this movie by chance when I clicked to watch the trailer for ""21"", I decided to add that movie to my watch list for later viewing and rent this one instead. Overall, I am satisfied with my decision. I'm not terribly surprised I had never heard of this movie before but some of the reviews I think are a bit too harsh.

I do agree that ""Father of Invention"" didn't turn out to be as funny as the trailer led me to believe, but that is okay because while watching it I didn't get the impression they were really trying to be that funny in the first place. I would label this as a light-hearted drama, if such a thing could exist. It's not too heavy and it will not make you cry, though I did find the speech at the end touching, but it is not a comedy either.

This movie simply tells the story of Mr. Axle trying to obtain some semblance of a life after serving eight years in federal prison; originally that meant regaining wealth and power but eventually includes regaining a quality relationship with his daughter Claire. While the first few minutes of the movie shows him at his peak and some of his successful products, the movie does not address how and why Mr. Axle was found criminally and financially liable for a product that caused bodily harm to thousands of people. Mind you, in the beginning Mr. Axle states before going to prison, his self-made business was worth 1.6 BILLION (not millions!) dollars, certainly in real life the chances of a CEO billionaire going to prison for any reason is highly unlikely but especially for a defective product; I noticed in some reviews this bothered people as it was not realistic, it didn't bother me much though. I think Phoebe (Heather Graham), Claire's roommate, could've been eliminated entirely. The self-proclaimed lesbian was irritating and served no purpose and was rude to Mr. Axle for no apparent reason from the start, her actions later in the movie made no sense - I won't detail it as not to spoil it for those who have yet seen the film. As a fan of both ""Hot tub time machine"" movies, I enjoyed seeing Craig Robinson play the role of Jerry, Mr. Axle's ex-wife's current husband. Of course all of his scenes were funny and his singing during the credits were a delight, he must have it written in his contract that he has to sing at least once in his movies! I have yet to see a movie of his where he does not sing or one I did not like. I can't believe they wasted the time to credit John Stamos for his role of Steven, a fellow guru who backstabs Mr. Axle, he is seen for maybe all of five seconds. Of course, Kevin Spacey as Mr. Axle was well played, I have yet to see a movie of his I didn't like. This is also the first movie I've seen with Johnny Knoxville where he was not vulgar, stupid, or just plain weird (ie.""Small Apartments"" which I couldn't even finish).

Overall, this movie is not groundbreaking in the least, but it is a decent film about a man who was once materialistic and obsessed with working figuring out more about himself and being a good role-model for his daughter. Not necessarily laugh out loud funny but interesting nonetheless.

Side note: the idea of mace/camera combo does seem useful!! But hey, I'll admit that I've been known to watch an infomercial or two. :=)",1435449600,2,3271,4.428571428571429

4652183,4,B005CA4SR4,"I have always a fan of Kevin Spacey.  In my humble opinion, he is in a class of elite actors that can actually become a character.  Therefore the only thing I knew before watching ""Father of Invention"" was that Kevin Spacey would give a great performance.  When the movie was over my assumption had been correct.

With regards to the plot it is somewhat simpleton maybe even trite.  Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) is an inventor of various products that one would find on an infomercial.  Unfortunately one of his products ends up severely harming a consumer and the aftermath ends up landing Mr. Axle in federal prison for eight years. Once released from prison, Axle finds that his life is in a state of condemnation.  He is broke, his name is mud, his marriage has ended and relationship with his daughter is strained. Notwithstanding, Axle is prepared to do what it takes to build his life back together and rebuild his finical empire.

I found the movie to be both predicable yet refreshingly different.  What the movie lacks in story, it compensates in the performance of its characters.  This film featured quite a bit of talent, Heather Graham, Camilla Belle, Jack McGee, Johnny Knoxville (which I found surprising) and Virginia Madsen (whom I am rather fond of).  This movie had a good balance of drama and humor.  This film also wasn't pretentious, yet didn't take itself too seriously.

In closing, ""Father of Invention"" wasn't the greatest movie I have ever seen, it isn't going to win any awards, none of the actors or actress will be remembered for their involvement in this film, yet there was something about it that gave it charm.  This charm made a rather simple film much more endearing.  I suppose if someone is looking for a non-stop action movie, a moot remake movie, a CGI film and/or a movie filled with potty humor then this movie will not be enjoyed.  I for one found it a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes.",1328572800,,1928,4.6765578635014835
4652184,3,B005CA4SR4,"Necessity may be the mother of invention, but greed is quite frequently the gatekeeper of prison cells.  An inventor named Robert Axle (portrayed by Kevin Spacey) learns this the hard way.  A successful businessman, he provides the public with a number of devices that they need (or think they need).  That is, until one of his most popular products leads to serious injuries.

This, in-turn, lands him in federal prison for gross negligence for the better part of a decade.  Meanwhile, 1/2 his fortune goes to his ex wife, while the other 1/2 goes to the victims of his invention (ostensibly via a Class Action lawsuit).

Poor Robert.  When he finally gets out of prison, he's still remembered, but not as the great inventor.  Rather, he's remembered as the guy who screwed-up so many people's lives.  Emerging from the prison gates, he finds that he has less credibility than George W. Bush!

The only person left in the world who gives a darn about him is his estranged daughter.  She tries to help him out & gets mixed results.  One of her roommates (portayed by Heather Graham) wants Robert gone for good.  Obviously, Heather has a grand old time playing a woman who is a militant lesbian (who actually may or may not be militant OR a lesbian!).

The reconciliation with the daughter is heartwarming, but ultimately it seemed to me as though the movie didn't do a good job in tying up some loose ends.  There are a few scenes that seemed to be thrown into the movie arbitrarily, and they're not really addressed by the ending.

All in all, this is a fairly enjoyable movie.  Not a great film, but not horrible.  Kevin Spacey fans are sure to be delighted with the film due to the fact that....well....it stars Kevin Spacey!",1328227200,2,1728,4.646864686468647

I've liked Kevin Spacey for quite a while so watching this film was, hopefully, going to be a bit of a treat for me, assuming it didn't wind up being horribly disappointing.  Thankfully, I guess, I got lucky and rather enjoyed this movie.  Spacey turned in a decent performance, as did the rest of the cast, and equally thankfully the script/story was entertaining enough to offer me a reasonable amount of pleasure.

While it isn't at the five star level for me, or, I suspect, for most movie watchers, it settled nicely into the 3.5 range, which I rounded up just because I'm still in a somewhat giving mood following the holiday season.  I'm not sure that I would have wanted to think about paying full price to see this in theatres, but on home video it was good enough to earn a buy it recommendation.  Kevin Spacey fans would probably get more out of the experience, while those that, for some reason, don't care for him would be best to avoid, but again it was good enough for me.

He makes this story almost worth watching.

His daughter is played by Camilla Belle who did such a great job in The Ballad of Jack and Rose. She goes through a wonderful array of emotions and colors as a daughter who loves her father and is ashamed of him at the same time. The problem in this film is that she's not funny. On the other hand, Heather Graham as the lesbian roommate, Virginia Madsen as the mother and Craig Robinson as the Madsen's new husband all get in the spirit.

It's still a light-hearted, entertaining movie with a simple message that we should value and appreciate our families and be careful not to get too obsessed by our work.  As many critics have noted, the screenplay is uneven and some of the humor falls flat.  The unlikely romance between Spacey's character and a much younger (and much better looking) ""lesbian"" stretches credulity.  But I still enjoyed this movie.

4652204,3,B005CA4SR4,"This had all the makings of a really entertaining and funny movie but somehow it just missed the mark.  It's not completely awful, but it's just OK when it should have been much better.

The cast is promising.  Kevin Spacey is a great actor and there's also Virginia Madsen and several other familiar actors.  And the premise of an infomercial guru (Robert Axle, played by Kevin Spacey) who lost everything when he went to prison and now is out and wants to start over sounded good.  So I think that leaves the script as the issue.  It seems like the writer/director couldn't started the movie as a spoof on informercials and then decided to throw in a little family reconciliation drama.  With elements of both types in the same movie, it doesn't work very well for either one.

The issues with this movie that keep it merely OK are pretty subtle.  The stuff that was supposed to be funny didn't make me laugh much and the stuff that was supposed to make me care about the characters often just confused me.  There was a scene with Kevin Spacey's character playing at the park with a little boy (that never would have happened given how shady he still looked at the time) that seemed really random.  Now that I think about it, I realize how it was supposed to fit in, but the director never really connected the dots.

A lot of the characters never got beyond cariactures so you don't get any kind of deep feel for them.  And Kevin Spacey's character flip-flopped between understanding how much people hated him and being completely oblivious.  That character wasn't particularly likeable so it was hard to root for him to succeed, either in business or with his relationship with his daughter.  And the angry roommate's character (played by Heather Graham) was all over the place and ended up just confusing me.

But the movie wasn't terrible either.  It just missed good and ended up at OK.

Corporate executives do not go to prison due to liability on their products even if they deliberately produce a product that will harm people. Ford Motor company proved that with their exploding Pinto. So now Kevin Spacey spends 8 years in prison and his family never comes to see him? Once you get past that...and I never really did, we end up with a movie that has some good scenes connected by a bad plot.

I didn't like Heather Graham defining herself as a lesbian to strangers. That was so unreal and not funny. The negative relationships and feelings that were rampant against Kevin Spacey, was not believable. Kevin played a guy whose only fault was that he enjoyed his work. If you want a somewhat feel good comedy without f-bombs, sex, or nudity this one might fill in...but don't think too hard about it.",1323043200,,859,4.61437908496732

4652207,2,B005CA4SR4,"Yes, I saw the less than stellar reviews for this film, but I'm a Spacey fan.  The man can wring a dynamic performance out of even the most hackneyed script.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what he had to do here.  Actually, there are several nice performances, but they still don't add up to a good film.

Father of invention is the story of Robert Axel, not an inventor, but a ""fabricator,"" and the king of an infomercial empire.  His reign at the top, however, comes crashing down when a product's design flaw causes hundreds of users to loose fingers.  He's convicted of a felony and serves eight years.  The film opens with Axel's release, and deals with his attempt to heal his relationship with his estranged daughter and to rebuild his life.  He's starting from rock bottom.

Reading that description, it has some potential, but very little is realized, and I really do place most of the fault on the embarrassing script.  In addition to Mr. Spacey, there's a strong supporting cast with many familiar faces, and as noted above, the performances were strong.  However, there weren't scenes I liked, so much as individual moments.  That's a little sad.

The only DVD extra was a brief ""making of"" featurette.  Not only was it not even remotely interesting, it was borderline offensive when the director compared Father of Invention to a Billy Wilder film.  Listen, this isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but I can't in good conscious recommend watching it.",1322352000,2,1465,4.804

The real problem of the movie was the fact that Kevin Spacey's character was meant to be shown as some sort of villain, but the way the movies set about making him an antagonistic character just simply does not work. You're supposed to hate him, but you don't really. He's a guy who caught a bad break. He's not the nicest person in the world, but you feel sympathy for him after what happened.

The movie's resolution is another problem. It felt forced, expected, and is not that satisfying. We spend an hour and a half with these characters and yet there is no substantial payoff for the investment. Movies are supposed to be larger-than-life. Yes this is an indie movie but you don't invest in a film without the intention of something happening that you couldn't see coming or couldn't read about in the newspaper.

I can't really think of a good reason to see Father of Invention. There are tons of great indie movies that come out, especially since Oscar season is just starting.

The acting is very good; the story isn't particularly compelling.  It starts with Robert Axle (Spacey) leaving prison after completing his sentence for -- selling a dangerous  product, the Ab Clicker, a combination ab roller / TV remote controller).  The fact that he would face criminal liability for designing an exercise/novelty product that injured folks doesn't make a lot of sense to me -- nor does the Spacey character in general.  He doesn't come across as an evil person who needs to be redeemed, but the movie is largely about his redemption, as a father and a friend.  Parts of the film really make no sense to me --the odd relantionship between Axle and his daughter's angryy lesbian (?) gym-teacher roommate.  Not sure how that advanced the film.

Robert Axle (Spacey) is the kind of guy you might love to hate because he's neglected his family for the sake of his job as inventor...ahem...fabricator of various cool gadgets. However, when a malfunction occurs with one product, with disastrous results, Axle spends the next eight years behind bars (why eight years in prison is never explained, wouldn't he just get sued?).  After his release, the film then focuses on one of its central issues: his reconciliation with his now adult daughter. (There are various flashbacks that depict Axle as a bit of a self-centered person, ego-driven and consumed with work, with little time for his daughter). Going from wealthy fabricator and business mogul to rock bottom, penniless and unemployed, Axle winds up staying at his daughter's place with her two female roommates on condition that he only stay a month until he gets back on his feet. While he tries to find work (he does land a job at Family Mart), he also tries to patch up things with his daughter (albeit in many hopeless attempts).

While Father of Invention is not a laugh out loud kind of comedy, it does shine in its light-hearted quirks, amusing characters, and entertaining and humorous situations. There are a few funny exchanges between Axle and his boss at Family Mart (Johnny Knoxville), who is resentful about hiring a convicted felon for this job, even if it does pay minimum wage. Another focus is on the change of Axle, although at points it does come across as contrived and forced. He learns about his prior selfishness and comes to terms with how to change this.

Over all, Father of Invention was entertaining and fun.  A surprisingly good comedy.",1321660800,,1858,4.830188679245283

Unfortunately they gave stellar performances of a script that had no idea what it wanted to be.  Starting off as a satirical comedy, delving into lifetime drama, a minute or two of random slapstick, then back to heartfelt drama... in the end it makes these wonderful performances completely forgettable.

Had this film decided to go the route of a comedy and been funny yet touching from beginning to end it would have been great... had this been a heart-wrenching drama of a man trying to reconnect with his daughter after living as a self absorbed douche for most of his life, it would have been good.  But the all over the ball park format of this film leaves the audience tuned out.

As far as the extras, there is only a VERY short making of video that was almost a waste of time.  Just short 30 second interviews with a few of the cast members.

The theme of this movie is strong, and I would love to see it explored further - the connection that people should have with their children, and how today's society of fast paced jobs, video games and constant attention hounding electronics dampen what should be quality connection time between people.  But the film never moved me.  In fact it was very upsetting to see such fantastic talent wasted.

For those of you who are unfamiliar here is a short synopsis:

Kevin Spacey plays a TV huckster who sells ""fabrications"" (you know... the stupid inventions on late night TV) and gets put in prison after one of his fabrications injures people.  After getting out of prison he is trying to reconnect with his daughter and get his life back together.

Should have been a 5 star movie, but only made it to a 3 star movie because acting can only count for so much.

The idea of this movie makes me smile... and most of Spacey's delivery works for me, but the film is awkward. This is especially true when it comes to the rest of the cast. Virginia Madsen's performance is blah. Craig Robinson... I don't even know how he still gets work in semi-serious roles. Even Heather Graham, whose militant faux-lesbian was probably the most interesting of the supporting roles feels uber-boring, especially when I've seen it done better (by Gillian Jacobs on Community). And what's Michael Rosenbaum doing in this 30 sec cameo?

Especially disappointing was Johnny Knoxville's retail ""assistant"" manager. He shows up for maybe 5% of the film and is fairly critical to the third act, but feels like a ghost. It was like seeing Harold Ramis cameo as the doctor in As Good As It Gets. Inexplicable and confusing.

As a father, I appreciate the idea that went into 'Father of Invention.' In many ways, this story of a father struggling to connect with his daughter while being a successful inventor (or ""fabricator"" as he calls it) is convincing and very human, even if it sometimes resorts to stereotype to tell it.

'Father of Invention' succeeds mostly through some excellent acting. Brought home by a solid lead performance in Kevin Spacey, who transitions Robert Axle well between the veneer of success and confidence to the underlying uncertainties in his personal life. Axle is an expert at taking seemingly unrelated ideas and putting them together to make something new (sometimes useful, sometimes dangerous) - but he can't seem to put his own life together. Recently released from prison after one of his ""fabrications"" went horribly wrong, he's trying to find his place in the world again, after most of his life has moved on without him.

Heather Graham, Johhny Knoxville, and Virginia Madsen all play their roles to the hilt too, whether that role is the angry lesbian or the annoying assistant manager or the bitchy ex-wife. They, like the ending of the movie, are a little too pat, a little too easy...but they fit into the picture well. It's a picture of a man who could make a billion dollars but can't manage to hang a picture on a wall without a disaster of Rube Goldberg proportions and can't hold down a job mopping floors at Family Mart. He can, however, take a well-aimed kick and make an ill-timed speech at his daughter's fundraising event.

'Father of Invention' is a movie along the lines of Adam Sandler's 'Click' or Jim Carrey's 'Liar Liar' -  a little scattered and a little trite, but it's also funny and observant and entertaining, and might even help you see the idea of fatherhood in a new light.",1321142400,,1845,4.753125

One final note, Heather Graham played a character who is about 25 years younger than her actual age, which is quite skillful on her part.",1504396800,,797,4.351351351351352
