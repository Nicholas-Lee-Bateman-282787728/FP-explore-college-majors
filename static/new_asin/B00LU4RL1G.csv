6506373,5,B00LU4RL1G,My 2 year old daughter just loves this movie.  She wants to watch it over and over.  I would say it is best for 2 & 3 yr olds.  Any older and i doubt that it would keep the childs attention because my 5 year old son isn't very interested in  it.,1301961600,,245,3.6538461538461537
6506374,3,B00LU4RL1G,This is a cute little movie that's great if your kids are in the bug and insect stage.  It's family friendly and teaches good values.  We just couldn't shake the feeling that we had seen this before.,1162425600,,199,4.351351351351352

6506376,1,B00LU4RL1G,"Awful is a rather polite word for this movie.
I have a lot of words that are more adequate to describe this waste of time.
I also not recommend paying to see this snorefest.
This is without a doubt a cheap cash-in on a Bug's Life and Ants.
I recommend Antz and Ant Bully and a Bug's Life over this.
This movie has very uninspired character designs and extremely bad animation.
The movie is also extremely boring too.
I would never subject an innocent child to this if I could help it.
They deserve better than garbage like this.
Even Goldenfilms and Goodtimes entertainment make better films than Spark Plug Entertainment.
This movie is a cynical cash grab designed to fool unsuspecting grandparents.",1477008000,,700,4.699186991869919
