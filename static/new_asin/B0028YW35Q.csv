3875245,4,B0028YW35Q,"""All the Sins of Sodom"" is easily the best of the Joe Sarno dvds that I have seen. The women are very attractive and the script is filled with seduction, compulsion, and the strong implication of ulterior motives that make the erotic going on much more powerful. The story for Sarno is very well done and much like a classical tragedy. Henning the photographer is so compulsively involved with his art, and sleeping with as many of his models as he can fit in, that he doesn't see the danger in the behavior of his new model. Unfortunately that actress's ability to deliver her lines isn't up to par with the rest of the cast, but her ability to display and project sensuality helps you to overlook that. Henning's love interest is quite beautiful and Sarno gives you plenty of opportunity to appreciate her body. It's easy to include nudity in the script when the lead is an erotic photographer.",1265932800,26,896,4.60625
3875246,4,B0028YW35Q,"After watching the documentary 'A Life in Dirty Movies' I wanted to see first hand what a Joe Sarno movie was like. I was able to stream All the Sins of Sodom for $1.99 and even though it was restored, the quality was poor.
That being said, the story was good. The way the scenes were filmed was really well done. Considering the year it was made, the sapphic love scenes were quite graphic and well staged.
I was able to get into the devious web our anti-heroine was weaving and really enjoyed the casual way the social stigma about lesbianism in America in the 1960's was handled.
Like I said, the picture quality is poor but the story and film style made it well worth it",1428105600,7,674,4.31496062992126

This is indeed a classic. But Amazon clearly doesnt care enough to be certain their videos are properly rendered.

3875272,3,B0028YW35Q,"Shocking, sensual and dramatic, this 1968 theatrical sensation is one of Joe Sarno's most compelling dramas - an erotic tale of lust and obsession, about an ambitious photographer, his love, and the sensual and manipulative woman who comes between them",1391644800,,252,5.325
3875273,4,B0028YW35Q,"Some people seem confused about Grindhouse films ... like complaining that there's not enough swearing in Roy Roger films. As a Grindhouse film, it is a classic. The women are attractive, they are mostly unclothed, they can act, there are lesbian scenes and there is a plot but it doesn't get in the way of the nudity - not sure what else you want. Just presenting a film in color shot on 4k digital does not necessarily make it a better Grindhouse film. How many films are out there now with nudity but about as sexy as a documentary about shooting whales? If you don't understand the contraints of the times - that's fine but you're simply not quliafied to judge this film. As note for a Grindhouse film, it's great.",1391040000,9,718,4.488549618320611

3875277,4,B0028YW35Q,"Nice T&A movie disguised as a high-brow Art Movie. There's a meaningless story in there somewhere, I think, but, make no mistake, this is primarily a display of beautiful women posing without much in the line of clothing.  Black&white, women who haven't been operated on, good acting. The only detraction is the quality of the digital copy in some places.",1390867200,,355,4.916666666666667

3875279,1,B0028YW35Q,"When I rented this soft-core film from 1968, I didn't expect Spielberg or Scorsese, but I did expect it to be watchable -- however, the digitization is so poor the image flicks from so-so black and white to way, way overexposed black and white, with sporadic pixelation thrown in for good measure. Amazon has a lot of nerve charging for this -- it makes me appreciate Netflix even more.

I'm not commenting on the content, since I could only stand to watch 13 minutes of this film. What I saw during that time was total crap -- poorly written, incompetently acted, not as good as the typical film-school student production. But what I like might be different from what you like. However, since the technical aspects are so lacking, my advice is to skip the Sins of Sodom.

You'd be better off watching a test pattern. I'll think twice about renting from Amazon again, if they offer stuff like this.",1390608000,2,898,4.60625

3875287,3,B0028YW35Q,"I watched a French documentary on Sarno and I thought I'd investigate his work further. Apart from the photography
which is thoughtful at least, the acting is terrible, the storyline preposterous and the total experience ultimately
tedious. I guess the lesson for me is 'beware of Frenchmen bearing analyses'.
I suppose when all's said and done, Sarno never saw his work as anything other than disposable, it's 'sexploitation'
for goodness sake and it's no better or worse than it ought to be.",1366588800,3,493,5.024390243902439
3875288,4,B0028YW35Q,"This is one of his best. An obsessive, ambitious and melodramatic fashion photographer, Henning, slowly loses his cool over two models in his employ, Joyce and Leslie, who Freud (and Joe Sarno) would say represent Sodom and Gomorrah within his mind. Both are attractive, one's falling in love with him while the other is slowly, deviously worming her way into his psyche to unravel his world .

Driven in a quest for artistic glory, he's encouraged by his agent to produce a volume of erotic nudes showcasing the perfect layouts for his favorite model, Leslie. He can't seem to get exactly what he wants from her photos, and then the mysterious Joyce appears on the scene. She has no money or place to stay, so Henning takes her in and she takes him in to her web of deceitful agendas, bisexual manipulations and ruinous intent.

There are also a handful of other models he photographs in the nude, two of which also succumb to the cat-like clutches of the vixen in various trysts. The minx plays havoc with his lifestyle, professional and personal love life without his awareness, as he's too wrapped up in his 'groovy' pictures to notice. (As the jazz giant Miles Davis used to say, ""That's why they call 'em 'bitches' - 'cause bitches are treacherous"").

The B+W (and the lens man's hairy back) will turn most of you away from viewing, but I'm old enough to appreciate the nuances that black and white imagery brings to the table. The nudity is plentiful; the babes easy on the eyes and the picture and contrast are great for a flick of its age, though there is some faint audio hissing in the background. There's some campy African drumming underscoring the 'primal' sexual passages onscreen, and the dialogue is a 'gas'. This, and 'Daddy Darling' are, in my opinion, Joe Sarno's best works from the 60's.

At the conclusion of the film, we see a man destroyed, sacrificed to his passions, consumed by a 'wicked jezebel' who came, saw, and conquered without reason, remorse or repentance.  Fans of 60's classier skin flicks will be 'Sodom'-ized by Sarno's soapbox sex saga.  Dig it, man, it's pretty far out.",1282608000,9,2112,4.725543478260869
