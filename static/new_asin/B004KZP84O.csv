This comedy turns into a farce when all the principals turn up at the honeymoon hotel and in, out, and through the bridal suite. This film is a weak farce with poor acting, a juvenile storyline, and forced attempts at humor. Dont waste your time with this one.",1521504000,,487,4.545454545454546
8433670,2,B004KZP84O,"In this 1932 version of a drawing room door-slamming farce, the intent is there but comes off with difficulty. Technically, this streaming B/W movie was of borderline quality that didn't help the comedy. Might be a good place holder for a rainy day waiting for the rain to stop...please. Oh, and he isn't the modern day Harrison Ford but a previous version.",1471564800,,357,4.774193548387097
8433671,4,B004KZP84O,"We thought that this movie was really cute!  Lots of laughs of the old-fashioned good humor type. Definitely an unsophisticated  precursor to the Pink Panther type of comedy. Having had a good-humored dad myself who became half deaf later in life, we all appreciated the misheard word jokes.  I am laughing now just thinking about the book we were all going to write filled with all the funny misheard word situations in our life with Dad.  This movie moved very quickly, too, and never left you waiting.  Great scenes with the various people hiding from one another..Funny and a nice surprise!",1470441600,,594,4.841584158415841
8433672,1,B004KZP84O,Wheezy antique of little value these days if it had any worth at all. Of interest mainly for Alberta Vaughn a name that doesn't cut much headway today. Still..acceptable enough as a curio.,1416096000,,188,4.7272727272727275
