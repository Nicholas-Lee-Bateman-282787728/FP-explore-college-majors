1931744,5,B0000E32UZ,"I started watching MI-5 on A&E as the show's title inspired some interest in me.  It's since become probably one of my favourite shows on television.  I'm also a fan of 24, but you definitely can't compare the two in my mind: 24 tends to do the unexpected, but that in itself is almost becoming expected.  MI-5, on the other hand, seems to me a much truer to life glimpse at the roles of agents in England.
As for a few comments about the 'negative' portrayal of America, I don't for a second think that the portrayal is meant to be unrealistic or as negative as the other reviewers may believe.  Although in this world MI-5 and the CIA may cooperate on matters of mutual concern, they're still very much separate entities working for different governments - governments with different views of how the world should look and function.  And as this show is from the English perspective, it makes perfect sense for the shows perspective to be skewed toward a more European view - and obviously the conflict filled interactions make for a more interesting story line.",1073692800,17,1064,4.638297872340425
1931745,5,B0000E32UZ,"A brilliantly scripted, acted, and executed spy drama. The one good thing about British TV is that they don't automatically assume that their audience is full of idiots like US shows do (beautifully portrayed by an earlier reviewer).
As a fan of ""24"", which most people feel compelled to compare MI-5 to, I have to admit that it makes ""24"" look REALLY bad. While I don't think the shows are all that similar, MI-5 is really for an educated viewer that doesn't need everything explained to them.
While I am a fraction of a bit disappointed that the Volume I set here didn't ship with all 12 episodes aired on A&E, I'm just happy to have the uncut Season 1 with 5.1 Surround Sound. GO BBC!
If you enjoy great writing, great acting, great drama, and great fun, MI-5 is for you.",1073606400,21,774,4.457746478873239
1931746,5,B0000E32UZ,"I like Kiefer Sutherland's 24 TV series, but MI-5 is far better hands down.  MI-5 screenplays are intelligent & storlines not always predictable unlike many American shows which are written for the 6th grade level mentality.  Definitely recommend this to all who enjoyed Sandbaggers with Roy Mardsen.",1073174400,6,300,5.361702127659575
1931747,5,B0000E32UZ,"According to the BBC America website this DVD will have the UK versions of the episodes which means an extra 10 minutes on each episode.

1931748,5,B0000E32UZ,"I caught the very first American showing of this on A&E and was hooked. It's smart, serious, and edgy. It pulls no punches, and always has you wondering what will happen next. There's no standard formula like so many of the American shows. ... This drama, about Britain's much more established version of the U.S.'s Dept. of Homeland Security, makes ABC's the Threat Matrix seem like show for Nickelodeon. It stays fresh, smart, and isn't affraid to show the viewer the good with the bad. And it gives glimpses into how other countries, namely Britain, view America's government.",1068336000,5,579,4.918367346938775

1931750,5,B0000E32UZ,OH MY GOD!  I normally wait until I can buy series dvds used by this is one that I will preorder!!!!  I love this series and can't not wait to have them in my collection. My only hope is that they include the footage that was dropped out of the A&E series.  It is my understanding that the A&E had to cut scenes to get it to fit in the one hour format.,1067558400,4,352,3.7945205479452055
1931751,5,B0000E32UZ,"I began watching MI-5 this year on A&E.  It's a big hit in Britain (where it's known as ""Snoops"") and has gained a sizable following here in the US.  The episodes are deftly written and well-acted, truly unlike anything else currently airing.  The tone is sometimes moody and a bit hectic, but that is the point of the series; these are British Intelligence agents working on matters of high security, from the attempted hack-in of the bankroll from which MI-5 pays their agents (undercover and otherwise) to Alexander Siddig's role as an Algerian defector seeking to infiltrate a sect of Muslim extremists.
The plots are fast-paced and the characterization is well-thought out and plotted; Tom McFayden's Quinn wrestles with a dual identity: he is trying to maintain a relationship while keeping his girlfriend Ellie in the dark.  One of the more emotionally telling moments of the first season is when Quinn suffers an injury and is forced to come clean with Ellie about his dangerous line of work.
This is one of the most original, suspenseful, and character-driven series' to come down the pipe in ages.  It is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys the spy genre and for those who simply enjoy a good drama.

I only made it through three series before Amazon in their great wisdom made it pay-to-watch. This kind of underhanded tactic is vexing. Might as well hand their video delivery services to Comcast or some other price gouging, anti-customer mega corporation

Intestingly, and sadly, the negative reviews I've written weren't so much about the program but the fact that video quality is beyond horrible and the bait-and-switch practice of suddenly making you pay for something that was included when you signed up.

1931884,5,B0000E32UZ,"(Caveat: I swear, I have no affiliation whatsoever with this series or anyone having anything to do with it! This series was so good, I am writing my very first review for it because I have yet to find a series that scores as highly (in my book, anyway), and because, after all the entertainment value these guys and gals have given me......well, heck, quickly dictating an honest review to the Dragon was the least I could do. Plus, this series just hasn't been marketed well here in the states, which is a shame because I really think that anyone looking for a great new series, or just a one off show to help them escape from the daily grind (or a crazy household), might also really enjoy it. So, here goes my two cents, for whatever that may be worth. Hope you get a chance to enjoy the series, and let me know your thoughts if you do via reply below! Thanks.
  Have yet to find a series as entertaining, suspenseful, engaging, and of such high caliber acting and production...all at once.  If you liked the 24 Series, if you like James Bond, the Bourne series, etc etc...or if you like the British shows, or if you are just looking for a great new series to get into (I could go on and on): THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST SERIES OUT THERE! Its underrrated, doesnt seem to be that well known here in the states, but that may be because the shows original title as shown/known in the UK I believe was/is ""Spooks""; presumably for the nickname our cousins across the pond seem to have given to spies, or what we may call ""G-men"". Whatever the reason, the show was a major hit in Britain, as evidenced by its longevity, number of seasons, revolving door of A-list Brit actors (both guest stars and regulars).  For my 2 cents (or 2 quid as it were), this series goes beyond just being a hidden gem; its probably one of my favorite series ever! (and having been through a lot of surgeries and the annoying but necessary bed rest that followed, I have watched a LOT of series, so sadly, Im a bit of a very underpaid expert here!).
  Show is also uniquenin that the characters change up every season or two. Ive seen some other non-US series do this, and i the case of this one, it really works bc it affords more flexibility in the storylines...and I will leave it at that so as not to spoiler.
  The characters are very well written and acted, and serve to suck you in emotionally where already entranced by the suspensful story and action. There are a zillion twists and turns in the plot, many of them unexpected (which I find the Brits are particularly good at). This is anything but another tired spy series, and actually had me with (yes, I admit it) a few tears welling up on much more than one occasion...which I found to be a very unique spy series viewing experience! But, the actors are just that good here!
  In sum, choose this series if you're looking for anything new to watch, at all! And, I blame my dictation APP for all typos and grammatical errors herein.....has nothing to do with editing abilities! (or my lack thereof! )",1452211200,,3043,4.398576512455516
1931885,5,B0000E32UZ,"I own every season of this series.  I love british TV and own/watch as much as I can but next to Sherlock Holmes, this is by far my favorite series.  Every episode keeps me on edge until the conclusion.  Talk about nail-bitting tense action.  Only sad part is that they kill off some of my favorite actors, but then so does Game of Thrones.  A new actor takes their place and he/she is great and the quality of the series stays just as high.",1447718400,,441,4.2023809523809526

The stories are believable and characters actually die from time to time. The conflicts seen are emotional and quite well acted. I have no complaints or criticisms of this series. It can be squeamish at times so you may have to close your eyes or look away for a moment or two. But, it is a very realistic drama and pulls no punches. One has to only hope our intelligent services in the UK and here in the US and elsewhere are staffed with such people of high character.

I find the characters personal lives immature and ridiculously neurotic but the intricacies of spying make up for that; almost. The Zoe character is perhaps the mist believable for me and the most appealing. Stay tuned if you want high drama and are tolerant of some silly emotions personally. PS.

1931990,3,B0000E32UZ,"This is a review of all 10 seasons, as I assume that anyone considering watching Season One will be sufficiently impressed to move on to other seasons. And then, too, there is my not having the desire to review each season.

This series supposedly takes us inside the secret world of MI5, Britains Security Service, which is tasked with domestic counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism. As portrayed in this series, its a John Le Carr universe on steroids and cocaine: the bad guys are really bad and really devious; the high-tech surveillance capabilities are impressive; the pace is fast; and almost no one is who he or she seems to be. The cast is strong and not chiseled in stone (few key characters survive all ten seasons); the early stories are interesting and relatively plausible; I was pulled in for the first few seasons. But as the series progressed, the writers turned their search for villains inward, and the programs motto became, in the words of the comic strip character Pogo, We have met the enemy, and he is us. Increasingly, the bad guys were well-placed politicians, members of the British and American intelligence communities, and even some in MI5; and the conspiracies were homegrown, high-level, and farfetched. Thus, three stars for the entire series: four stars for the early seasons; two stars for the later ones",1398556800,2,1344,4.973333333333334
1931991,3,B0000E32UZ,"I began watching MI5 about 6 months ago and have been going through the seasons one by one (I am in Season 5). The writing is very good, the plots feasible and the pace fast BUT, I have to ask, what is wrong with these people. They constantly put themselves in danger even after they know they are specific targets, even after agents have been killed, and yet there they are like pins on a bowling lane, absolutely defenseless and harmless to their killers! How many need be assassinated or blown up before they arm themselves. All the terrorists and bad guys are armed but our fearless team marches into danger incapable of defending themselves! A show like this would fail in its first season in the USA as the audience at large would lose sympathy for agents so pig headed stupid.

I have this down to political correctness run amuck. As long as the public believes agents survive in the real world due to clever writing and not simple common sense, the series would never find a mass audience here. I figure the entire cast would die in season one if the bad guys were even half competent.",1396051200,2,1093,4.492462311557789

1931994,5,B0000E32UZ,"MI-5 is a terrifically interesting, intellectual television series, filled with lots of ""bang-bang shoot-em-up"" excitement and a serious dash of beating-up on the USA. Though I love the program, its value is more profound - to me, anyway - via the street-angle view of London at its best (of course) and a generous peek into the Brits' opinion of us (seriously challenged and ignorant) Yanks. They just don't like us a bit - at least, most certainly not in this series - I wager, an accurate depiction of their ""take"" on us dullards. All Americans are portrayed as beefy, brutish, overtly cunning, loud-mouthed jerks, better suited to a wrestling mat or used-cat lot, with blonde bombshell cheerleader-type females somehow playing the honeypot angle...regardless the character's position in the spy game or political arena. Legendary fun though, the characters are rich and dynamic, each (British) one generously ""fleshed out,"" giving the viewer a unique perspective when watching this series, uncommon to the genre. The filming style is slick and unique, making the viewing experience uncharacteristically personal. I've enjoyed every single episode, and wish there were more. Thanks, Amazon, for bringing this series to us (poor, stunted and viciously greedy) Yanks. Bravo!",1390262400,,1275,5.38

1932000,4,B0000E32UZ,"I am charmed by Matthew Macfadyen's style--cool self-possession broken by moments of utter ingenuousness. He could make me believe almost anything, even the unlikely rigors of Tom Quinn, a man leading the unglamorous, on-demand life of a British spy while doing everything in his power to shelter his fledgling family. We know from watching countless spy shows that this will never work. National crises take precedence and often prevent him from attending important moments of family life. Worse, he must shut his dear ones out, giving them a false excuse or no excuse--and who would believe the true importance of his work, even if he could divulge it? ""Sorry dear, I was saving the prime minister from assassination just now. Oh that, it's just a nick."" And of course one day an insidious baddie may suss out his home address...a spy with attachments is vulnerable. Do we forgive him for following the dictates of his heart, or do we condemn him for being selfish and placing his loved ones at risk? With Macfadyen in the role, we are inclined to forgive. This is only the tip of the iceberg and the underlying heart-plot for the first two seasons of MI-5. Get ready for kidnappers, bombs, terrorists, thugs, international crime rings, and all manner of mayhem as the MI-5 team stymies threats to national security. Great ensemble cast, fast-paced, well-written. Exciting guest appearances. Violence is occasional and non-gratuitous.",1376265600,2,1436,5.063291139240507

1932024,2,B0000E32UZ,"Normally, I love anything British.  After all, they certainly have the corner on spy thrillers.  However, MI-5 is to James Bond what TJ Hooker is to Prime Suspect.  The main issue I have is that the producers obviously think that their audience is unsophisticated and ignorant as to how the world really works.  Their aim is to provide the audience with nauseating ""teachable moments""  about how people should behave when dealing with terrorists and other sordid baddies.  At times I felt that I was being spoon fed what I should think instead of being shown reality and deciding for myself.  The problem is that when you expect your audience to ""just accept"" things without examination, your plot can quickly become absurd instead of poignant.  Here's some examples.

Step 1) When faced with a hostage crisis, forget about tactical assault. That's too violent.  Just spend almost the entire episode installing listing and snooping devices.  Accompany the scene with intense music so that the audience thinks you are actually working toward resolving the issue instead of just delaying the ordeal and costing more lives.  For example, in one episode, a hostage strapped to a bomb almost dies of an ASTHMA attack because he has waited so long to be rescued.  Luckily they can hear him wheezing through the microphone they have secretly inserted into the villain's liar.  Thank goodness. Now we actually have reason to get inside the building...That man needs his meds!

Step 2) Seize your opportunity to climb the spy ranks by volunteering for a high-risk assignment and then make a pass at your senior partner because ""you can't bear to be alone"" after you realize how dangerous the job really is.  The next day, get your face pushed into a deep fat fryer by the bad guy so that your senior partner feels guilty that he didn't sleep with you to comfort you. Now you are dead.  We will skip the part where you were completely unqualified to be in MI-5 and instead concentrate on the sad partner..Who is really cute...and now very sad.  Cue the sad music.

Step 3) Don't tell your live-in girlfriend that you are really a spy because your last girlfriend spilled the beans to all her friends and put your life in danger and you had to dump her because of it.  But, when you finally do ""come out"" DO TELL her 5 year old daughter the whole sordid story...She won't EVER tell her friends and you will score points with mom.  Who, by the way, was perfectly okay shacking up with you-with her small child - not really knowing who you were. But, she is now OUTRAGED when she learns you are a spy for the government. Is there nothing worse? The writers expect us to feel her pain?

Lastly, portray a complete stereotype about Americans by making the anti-abortion bomber a woman from the Ozarks.  When you catch her, leverage your interrogation power by not offering to extradite her to Florida...You know...where they actually execute people?  Oh gads...Not the electric chair!  Let's not dwell on her grizzly crime.  Instead, let's focus on how we feel about America's death penalty.  Your audience will never realize that she would actually be tried at the federal level as a terrorist and it wouldn't matter what state she was shipped to.  Then when you extradite her, have your ""Yank"" cohorts with sinister glee inform her on the way to the airport that-despite her cooperation- she's actually going to Orlando to ""see Micky"" after all....So sinister those Yanks.

This show could be great...I wish it had been written for grown ups.",1373241600,5,3529,4.796357615894039

1932029,2,B0000E32UZ,"Blatantly anti-American.  I love Matthew MacFadyen in Pride & Prejudice (which he was in after he was done with this series) but I lost some respect for him after viewing this.  Really, any of the actors in this show who would act out such ridiculously prejudiced scenes have lost some of my respect.

It's the typical liberal/socialist Brit attitude - Americans are out to execute all criminals, kill immigrants, and get involved in the Middle East just for oil.  That's the plot synopsis for episodes 1 - 3.
Episode 1 features a devoutly Christian woman with a Southern American accent bent on killing abortion doctors in Britain.  Right, cause that makes sense.  We're just a bunch of murderous, self-righteous Bible-thumpers.  And America is so hell-bent on capturing terrorists that they want to haul her back to America to face execution (which, apparently, is just so awful), and don't care whether her people carry on with their plans to kill more people as long as America gets her.  And there are some snide remarks about ""the land of the free.""

Episode 2 basically calls anyone who isn't for open, indiscriminate immigration into countries a right-wing, male chauvinist, abusive, murderous bastard.  It features an abusive, murderous man importing illegal immigrants from Chechnya into Britain so that they'll cause an immigration issue and cause Britain to close its borders.  He throws the people in the ocean to drown when his plans don't go right, and he jams a woman's head into a deep-fat fryer then shoots her, all in the name of keeping Britain for the British.  Yeah, ok, right.  Anyone who doesn't want people from all sorts of different countries, dangerous or not, entering their borders freely must be a soulless bastard.

Then in Episode 3, terrorists are to be pitied because they must have righteous causes - their parents have been imprisoned for rebellion and their country was apparently persecuted by America for oil rights.  Terrorism is therefore justified, let's just try to understand them and it'll all be fine.  Ridiculous.

It's unrealistic and inaccurate, heavily biased, and very clearly agenda-ridden.  I thought the Brits were supposed to be our allies?  Clearly not, with all this snide hatred and unjustified accusations infused into the show.  I love a lot of British shows, but this is not one of them.  Unfortunate, considering the series features some of my favorites like Matthew and later on, Richard Armitage.",1366761600,5,2461,5.042079207920792

I don't know if it's a BBC issue or an Amazon issue or what, but the captions are completely out of synch with the scenes.  They are always about three or four scenes ahead of what's actually happening on the screen at any given moment.  Not only is this completely useless if you need them to know what's happening at the time, but it ends up spoiling what's coming up as well.  This is probably not a major concern for a lot of viewers who don't use the captions, but for those of us who do rely on them, it is disastrous and totally uncool.  I watched all of the first season and have started on the second, hoping with each episode that the situation will improve itself, but so far it's been the same with every single ep.  Because of this, I'm afraid I will not be able to continue watching what would otherwise be a very appealing show.  I have mixed feelings about my rating because it's not the fault of the series itself, which otherwise has some good stuff going on, but I can't see giving it a higher rating when this error keeps me from being able to watch or enjoy it at all.

Each episode is edgy, thrilling and leads you into the next one. The final episode for each season has been a true cliff-hanger. I'm very thankful that I don't have to wait months for the start of the next season.

This is also equal-opportunity espionage with Russian, Iranian, and Irish spies so far. Also financial espionage and attempts to bring down the British government in a number of creative ways. It's fun to watch characters who are driven by political ambitions and see how they are dealt with.

The actors and their screen characters are fairly believable, although some of the plots were a little out there. I recommend this to those that are tired of your ordinary spy series or movies.

1932142,5,B0000E32UZ,"There have been many comparison to 24 with this series and I will tell you upfront that I have no idea having never seen the show.

What I can tell you is the show is amazingly addictive, complex and assumes that you will have some knowledge of world affairs.

For Americans, MI-5 is analagous to our FBI, more or less.  Rather than bogeyman Muslim extremists that pepper our American psyche, MI5 deals with a more textured and varied group of enemies.

It is violent, extremely so.  An earlier reviewer makes a point of a scene where they had to step away and not watch or listen and I've a very good idea which scene they, without being explicit were referencing.  Oddly, when a gun isn't the go-to weapon for everyone from eight year olds up, the violence is so viceral that you cannot help being aware.

The scripts are taut, direction is stunning, acting is wonderful (and pretty clear why it's made several careers) and if it has any true flaw, the scene design is limited, clearly by budget, not ingenuity.  Of course, it will be Season 5 or 6 before you start noticing, there's too much going on.

1932144,4,B0000E32UZ,"This is about the whole season series 1-10 and not about the physical aspects of the DVD's themselves.
This show, seen back to back episodes, in some ways is like watching a gigantic disaster movie where only a few of the long term actors surviving to the end of the 10th season.  In other ways, it is like Hamlet; research that to see how it ends.  One cannot take comfort  their favorite character will make it alive out of the episode where they are hanging upside down over a tank of piranhas (ok that scene does not exist, I'm just saying..).  In fact, the 2nd episode of the first season is missing on some streaming services (i.e. Netflix) because there was a scene so horrible, so disturbing, many angry viewers called in with complaints which jammed BBC phone switchboards.

I appreciated the  unexpectedly long,  episodes, almost a full hour as like American TV used to be in the olden days.  One gets a lot of show as most series tend to  being around 40-45 minutes, host as they are to the every increasing content consuming parasitic commercials.

There are  plenty of nail-biting bomb defusing episodes--it may actually go off, watch out!

I must wonder though, in at least one of the episodes there must have been some  behind the scenes show ""politic"" event.  A promising plot development with a strong nemesis and a humdinger of a cliff hanger kept me riveted, wondering what would happen next .  In the next episode, however,  this plot was entirely truncated, the nemesis removed in an eyeblink cut scene with little explanation.

The British MI-5 service shares some commonalities with the US FBI, handling domestic security concerns while the MI-6 probably is roughly equivalent to the CIA.  Broadly, as one Brit put it  MI6 are ""our"" spies while MI5 is there to catch ""their"" spies.

This show may or may not have anything in common with the real MI5 service, but assuming it does, there are some things I learned:

--If I joined MI5, there is a very good chance I will be killed by MI6.
--There is a good chance of getting killed, period.  If luck snuggles with me, however, I might be handed a wad of cash, a passport and told to disappear.
--The CIA is bad.
--My superiors got some scam going on or are involved in some nefarious shadowy international plot.
--I can expect to be framed at least once.
--If I have offspring, they will be kidnapped and held hostage.
--The traffic cams work pretty good.
--Somebody I admired in the secret service, will at some point go crackers and jump off a building.

Five stars minus one for following some aspects of Hamlet just a bit too closely.",1346544000,,2609,4.623913043478261
1932145,5,B0000E32UZ,"I think this is the best espionage series on TV.  But be warned - this is not James Bond.  The british secret service agents portrayed in this series do not drive around in Aston Martins, spend their evenings wearing tuxedos and sipping martinis, and definitely don't have exciting sexual escapades with a bevy of beautiful women.  This show takes a more realistic approach to the world of espionage - exploring the difficulties that spies have in maintaining healthy personal relationships when the nature of their job requires them to lie on a regular basis.  Agents also have to deal with the political and professional ambitions of those around them while struggling with their own consciences because of some of the tactics they must employ to protect their country.  There has been a lot of negative critique about the first episode of Series 1 because of the abortion issue but you should know that this episode ISN""T about abortion - its about terrorism.  Whether its muslim extremists in Afghanistan or evangelical right to lifers in Des Moines, its all the same - blowing up buildings and killing people because they don't share your point of view is terrorism plain and simple!!!  For those who might be put off by what some call an anti-christian bias, the first episode is the only one that deals with a topic like abortion.  Subsequent episodes address issues of domestic security threats such as human trafficking and drugs and Britain's political relationships with countries such as India, Russia, and Iran.  This is an excellent show and anyone who is a fan of the spy genre will enjoy it.  Be warned though - DON'T get too attached to any particular character because as in the real world of espionage, agents die or burn out because of the stresses of the job.",1343952000,,1780,4.8256578947368425

Season 7 has been my favorite so far.  You really should watch them in order to get the characters.

Another comment:  this is one show that my husband and I can love together--enough action and intrigue for him, enough character development for me.  The stories are creative.

1932148,4,B0000E32UZ,"I watch very little TV as I do not find most of it interesting.  The puzzles on this show are a little too easy to solve, but all in all, I still like the show.

I think my original review might have been a little obtuse. The ""puzzles"" are the problems/situations that these agents must solve. They are often very easy for the viewer to solve. In hindsight I think some puzzles weren't solved b/c they needed them to not be solved to buttress a weak story. Case in point. In one of the episodes a team member was locked in a house with a bomb in a laptop. No one could get into the house to help. The doors and windows had recently been reinforced to prevent burglary. Time was running out. My first thought was: ""The front door is ground level. You've got a small car right out front that you just parked. Drive that car up the driveway and into/through the front door."" Instead, they just ran around, ""ANGSTING"" and showing how powerless they were.

Having finally caught up on past seasons of Dr. Who, guess what I recently watched the Dr.'s old robot dog suggests to Micky when they are locked out of the school where bad stuff is going on?  Wait for it...................... They drove the car through the locked doors.

I did enjoy this show, but badly constructed roadblocks to reinforce a poor story line are just that.

Oh, and don't get my wife started about how one of the women's footwear magically changed to fit the situation EVERY SINGLE TIME. She's got high heels that match her outfit. They leave the building and she's still got the same shoes on. Seconds later, they need to pursue a bad guy and, luckily for her, the shoe fairy is nearby to transform her fashionable footwear into footwear suitable for chasing perps.

1932172,5,B0000E32UZ,"Thought it might be interesting to share my thoughts on Season one of MI-5 as I slide into watching Season Seven.
  For the MI-5 newbie, Season 1 is only slightly above average and yes, the first couple episodes aren't worthy of 5 stars. Don't make the mistake I almost made and discontinue this series after scrutinizing the first couple of episodes. If you're not totally enthralled mid-2nd Season, don't bother continuing.
  MI-5 might very well be one of the best written, best edited, most intriguing series that I've ever watched. Sorry to all the ""24"" fans, but MI-5 is ten-fold superior and the plot and storylines make a mockery of writers of ""24"". (Yes, I enjoyed ""24"")
  Case in point (regarding the majority of US Series);
US series
  -same actors/heroes will never die because producers need them back to carry on the series (unrealistic)
  - US series (minus advertisements) are usually around 20 to 36 minutes.
  -bad guys always lose (unrealistic)
  -actors appear to all be Clooney or Alba clones (unrealistic)
  -character development is not generally a strong suite for so many US series writers due to budget and production time-tables.
 BBC Series
  -No one actor is bigger than the series itself. Anyone is capable of being removed by death, captured, corruption, torture, traumatized or even completely wrong in decision making. This creates realistic appeal and what makes this MI-5 so darn believable.
  - each episode is approximately 50 to 60 minutes
  - Bad guys and bad countries win often, just like in real life
  - actors are uniformly qualified as US actors (debatably even more-so), but all actors appeal to look like average people we all know and work with, no glitz pure acting
  -plot, character development, and mystery are, and have been, a strong suite for the British for quite sometime now.

  This is, as stated, by so many others, a edgy, dark, thinking person's series not a special effects, wild-west exploding shoot-out series.
  Get through, don't skip, Season One because MI-5 only continues to out-do itself with each passing season.
...the only three negatives regarding MI-5 are 1) the DVD menus (which has been stated) are tedious to graft but improve with each passing season, 2) MI-5 is the most addictive series I've ever watched (including Lost, 24, Dexter, The Sopranos, West Wing, True Blood, etc.), 3) I just purchased Season 10 (2/27/12) and this is MI-5's final season!",1330300800,5,2432,4.972636815920398
1932173,5,B0000E32UZ,"Let's just say it and get it out the way: MI-5 is simply one of the greatest dramatic television series ever made. I know that's a ridiculously grandiose statement that is an easy target of criticism, but if you'll just browse down the titles of the 100+ reviews of MI-5 Season One here on Amazon, you'll be able to get some independent verification of that statement. It's quite true: once you get into this series, it is hard to think otherwise. It might take up through to the beginning of Season Two to be fully convinced, but after that, chances are you'll agree, and you'll want to watch the series all the way through.

MI-5 is smart, dramatic, intelligent, exciting, thought provoking, well written and directed, beautifully filmed, and wonderfully acted. It's a crown jewel in the BBC's tiara, and will remain difficult to surpass for a very long time indeed.

""MI-5"" (Military Intelligence, Section 5) is that part of the British security service that focuses on internal security and threats (as opposed to MI-6, which deals with extra- and international threats to the UK). This means that the service deals with any potential internal threat, including crime, terrorism, domestic economic threats, and counter-espionage. Its headquarters is in Thames House in London. The show MI-5 focuses on a variety of domestic threats arising from both domestic and international sources, and is based on the Section D Team within MI-5, which focuses on counter-terrorism, and is led by Harry Pearce (Peter Firth, in the role of his career). Although different issues and challenges arise in each show, and it is certainly possible to watch shows at random, the series is best enjoyed and appreciated when viewed in episode order due to the manner in which dramatic themes are built and extended across episodes. This is a show that rewards the viewer for effort put into watching the series in order.

Season One does not get off to the best of starts. Most shows, particularly those as complicated and as wide reaching as MI-5, experience similar issues with the pilot episode, and MI-5 does not fully escape that fate. That's too bad, because some might see that first episode and decide the show is not quite their cup of tea. In my own mind, the first episode of Season One suffers from a contrived script on a too-obvious story (and, unfortunately, contains some needless violence that is thankfully not seen elsewhere in the series), but it should not really be missed if you wish to work through the show because of the cast introductions and orientations to the show that occur in this episode. We can easily say that Episode One of Season was more for the benefit of the writers, cast, crew, and directors of the show rather than the viewers, but they all learned fast, and they learned well. As Season One progresses, we start feeling we are watching a well-oiled and precision racing machine that is gaining increasing momentum as the episodes unfold, and by the time we reach the cliff-hanging ending of Season One, we can easily see that this is an amazing show.

Some of the Seasons have been hideously expensive to purchase on DVD, but some of that may be reduced at this point (late 2011). Each season normally contains either eight or ten episodes. However, when one considers that most of these episodes are more like mini-movies than television shows, the price becomes much more understandable. Unfortunately, no Blu-ray versions currently exist (to my knowledge). But the DVD quality is superb. Gorgeous filming and excellent sound make these episodes among the best you'll ever see from television.

Is it allowable to give a seven out of five stars ranking? If so, that's how I would rate this show, particularly as we get into Seasons Two onward.

Note ...
To much agonizing around the world, MI-5 was finally ended by the BBC in late 2011 (Season Ten). As of December 2011, there is no word of the North American release date, but most assume it to be either first or second quarter of 2012. The discussion boards and blogs were filled with sadness about the end of the show, but the BBC felt that this was the best place to tie off the show, probably for financial as well as artistic reasons. There is some talk of an American spin off. I am skeptical of that, because, although anyone can easily enjoy this show, it is quintessentially a British show, and that's really part of its appeal.",1325548800,,4419,4.800262812089356
1932174,5,B0000E32UZ,"Are you tired of the 4 network's programming - mindless hour long shows with 42 minutes of programming and 18 minutes of commercials (36 x 30 sec!), and some of the most unrealistic neat-o lab instruments that conduct DNA tests as fast as spitting out a piece of paper when a real DNA test takes 2 weeks to complete.  Tired of television where magic colored lights make things appear out of nowhere using some UV ink splashed on before filming?  How about the magic Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer which really takes 18 minutes to stretch out a sample, but for our sake the same little bottle gets picked up every episode and out comes a piece of paper with a bunch of lines from which all sorts of conclusions are drawn.  There is no mention of the hydrogen carrier gas that makes it work!  If you pick out technical inaccuracies in the CSIs or other shows, this is a must.

MI-5 (spooks in the UK on BBC TV) takes you away from the mindless American sitcoms and quiz shows where contestants are briefed on the proper answer (in fine print) to make for artificial television.  Even so called reality TV isn't real any more on US primetime network TV.

MI5 is the 2002 evolution of the cold war in a post 9/11 atmosphere.  Actors do not live on and on to be shot at and protected by a car door (hint bullets go through car doors like paper) in MI5.  If an MI-5 actor lasts more than 3 consecutive seasons they are not doing any field work!  MI-5 has the full gammut of actors from the ruff russian consular officer to the slick London MI5 professional, dedicated to his/her country.

While watching you are not treated like a mindless idiot with magic tricks of the production company.  You are shown the real world of MI5 (or as close as you will ever come).  England has two agencies which parallel the FBI and CIA, called MI5 and MI6 respectively.  So you start by forming your british to american english dictionary with MI5-->FBI.  It's a show about spying inside of Britain.  Yes, vocabulary is strictly british english - you must get off the lieu to answer the tele, pull on your trousers and fill your auto with petrol, pop the bonnet

A few times MI5 liases with MI6, the CIA from US, The russian federation, and other countries we ignore in our TV programming - even though they exist.  You'll realize that most of the action is filmed in London.  And add to your vocabulary words like the tube, underground, fish and chips, and you're on the way to realizing the accents and language used in London.

The CIA has a wall of stars - anonymous people who died in service to the USA.  Don't expect your favorite charactor to be there at the end of the next episode.  Agents encounter lethal problems like bombs, bullets, drowning, toxins, and other spy favorites that come from real spy to spy encounters.  By the end of season 3 all the main characters are gone and season 4 begins with just the head of MI5 in position.  That wall of stars in the CIA lobby did not get there without alot of sacrifices, and MI5 is realistic to that end.

You'll learn the skill of the dead drop, that not everyone carrys a gun nor needs to, that psycology can accomplish a mission effectively without firing a shot, but if shots are fired, people blead and sometimes die.  Again, it is realistic.  Cars are right hand drive which works well when you drive on the left side of the two lane road!  CCTV cameras cover nearly all of London central, and all cellular or landline calls are routed through echelon for word detection as part of MI5's intelligence gathering.  Car chases are far less americanized - no big V8 engines and squealing tires. MI5 works in the background using their assortment of tracking devices, Taxis which are run by MI5 with drivers that report back their drop off location, and of course the camera network to get information about a car traveling through london and convey it to the following vehicle.

You will find yourself taken to foreign lands by air travel when remote intelligence is involved.  Even the insides of foreign consular offices are decorated with the proper theme of the home country.  Diplomatic pouches are carefully inspected by X-ray to determine if a manual inspection is needed.

MI5 does take liberties on occasion - the x-ray machine which can read a stack of pages of paper and ""print"" them all for review later on.  Of course there are 205 Ghz bugs the size of a small thumb tack with tracking capabilities on mobile phones.  Bond's Q would have a field day on some episodes, but they do keep it real - communications don't work underground, in tunnels, and other places where poor reception is found.  cell phones do drop calls, and cell phones never have a dialtone on them.  Of course the network is GSM with SMS, but not every message is readable  - you'll need to pay attention and watch who is contacting who and what is being sent when and how it pertains to the particular episode.

Seasons 1-3 are sort of a set but expect a new group of primary actors by season 4 as they die off or retreat into their spy's 2nd identity and are retired (burned) out of MI5.

Episodes are generally 59 minutes of program material beginning with an important setup, then the opening credits kept to a minimum, followed by the central office agency action plan as twists develop.  The dead drop is a common means of communication when everyone taps everyone else.  Nothing is secure.  Some carbombs are set off by celllular phone while others a turn of the key.  A season will have a varrying number of episodes.  Seasons 1-3 were smaller as the program grew in popularity - they were exported to the USA on broadcast PAL->NTSC conversion.  As the show's popularity increased so did the number of episodes in a series.

MI5 is an acquired taste.  The accents and action are not characteristic of USA primetime, so don't expect a fuzzy store's videotaped surveilance camera from an 80's VHS tapedeck to be suddenly improved at CSI HQ.  Anyone who's played with photoshop knows that you can make a sharp photo fuzzy but making HDTV from a surveilance tape to do facial recognition isn't going to happen in real life.  I think that's the part I like the most about MI5 - they do not insult your intelligence.  Echelon is a real system that does use a computer to monitor calls placed in any language for certain words.  Every consulate's phone lines are tapped and sent to the FBI or CIA without a warrant.  If you say the USA would never do things like this, well there are 20 children who the US DOE fed small doses of plutonium to in their school lunch program to study its effects on the body during the cold war.  The USA tapped russia's undersea fiber optic cable using our submarines and a device known as a quarter wave transformer that allowed coupling of optical energy out of the fiber without cutting it and sounding the alarm at the phone company.  I know because my professor designed that system while working at bell labs in NJ, USA before he became fed up with it and moved to Davis, CA to be my faculty advisor in microwave and fiber optic theory.  MI5 even has an episode about the submarines that tap the undersea fiber optic cables, although their graphics are technically incorrect, their theory has been in practice for decades and represents reality.

With only a few unbelievable exceptions, the MI5 tools are appropriate for the time it began (2002).  It ran for 10 seasons.  It's closest counterpart in USA TV would be X-files, but the realism in MI5 is certainly more accurate.  Prime members can watch all but 2 seasons for free - and amazon is missing seasons 9 and 10 which just finished airing on BBC TV.  Watching MI5 will cause you to open your eyes to what really happens in the world of espionage and brings to light the police state that Britian has become.  Occasionally a theme may span 2-3 episodes then a new storyline begins.  Some build on the previous episode for facts you need to know  - it is best watched from season 1 episode 1 through the end of season 8 without gaps.  Some seasons are not free for prime members (I know either season 4 or 5 isn't free) - but true to life, in Britain you PAY to watch over the air TV which is FREE in the USA, so it's jusst added realism.

Enjoy MI-5 or ""spooks"" with a fine cup of tea.  With no commercial breaks in the hour program you may need to pause it!",1325462400,,8384,4.512259774685222

The discussion boards and blogs were filled with sadness about the end of the show, but the BBC felt that this was the best place to tie off the show, probably for financial as well as artistic reasons. There is some talk of an American spin off. I am skeptical of that, because, although anyone can easily enjoy this show, it is quintessentially a British show, and that's really part of its appeal.",1324512000,4,4424,4.797900262467191

Thus, here I am viewing Season One (1), for the first time, and I enjoyed it immensely,  so much that I do plan to continue viewing all of the earlier episodes (Seasons 2-6) of this very ""high-tech"" intense thriller/spy series.

Although, I did find Season one (1) of MI-5 a little less intense than the later Seasons that I have seen (Seasons seven-7-forward), I enjoyed the story-lines and the acting very much--Mathew Macfayden as the lead along with the rest of the actors are really very good infiltrating and spying into some really nasty threats to the peace of England and into some ugly situations filled with some very unsavory characters. I look forward to viewing Seasons two through six(2-6).",1319414400,,922,4.859872611464968
1932205,5,B0000E32UZ,"MI-5 is the division in Britain that takes care of security within Britain.  MI-6 takes care of security from forces outside of Britain. The actor who plays House, appears in and out of the series.

I read in one of the reviews that it was difficult to navigate through the beginning of the DVD to get into the series.  I like it because it is a puzzle and it will change in different series. You will become accustomed to the unusual opening to start the series, so it will be easier as time goes on.

In the first series, a man who has a legitimate company for waste removal is a racist and is trying to start a race riot.  He also has a high level government official in his pocket.  He has a beautiful young wife who he beats.

MI-5 is aware of the problem through their intelligence gathering; MI-5 assimilates into the racist's family, but the racist finds out they are spys.  First he kills a newspaper reporter who is gathering information undercover.  Then two of the MI-5 spooks are captured by the racist.  The MI-5 operative is told if he does not provide information, he will stick the young woman's hand in boiling oil, which he does.  As the operative hedges again, her face is pushed into the boiling oil until she is killed.

The male operative was able to escape.  The wife was able to work with MI-5 to pull her husband down.  And MI-5 has a sniper kill the racist as he killed one of their own.

So, if you like thrillers which require attention to find out the subtleties in the series, then MI-5 is a must see.  I own the series.  Even at the end of the series and one major actor leaves, a new actor comes in and the series is even better, which is not the case in many other series.",1318032000,,1706,4.28125

1932207,4,B0000E32UZ,"The spies at MI-5 are young and attractive and skilled at their jobs. They have to save Britain from security threats from within the country and from abroad. There is never a quiet moment at MI-5. A friend recommended this series and raved about how fascinating and rivoting it was. I found the pilot rather uninspired. This time the threat is from an American named Mary Kay. If she has snuck into the UK and is planning a terror seize and the MI-5 knows her whereabouts, why not just arrest her?

The theme behind this series is the need to always get hard evidence before making a move even if that puts more lives in jeopardy. It isn't easy being a spy and one aspect of series one that is fascinating is how does a spy have a personal life? Is it possible? Master spy Tom Quinn has fallen in love and how does he explain to his lady and her little daughter about the late night calls and mysterious meetings? Realtions within the group are not easy, too, as they try to outspy each other and come out on top.

MI-5 does have a modernistic feel and a vibrant look to the series. I found the DVD setup to be the most annoying. I didn't realize what was happening at first as this masked spy enters an office and is instructed to go to the CD rack or the phone. It's cute the first time but annoying as you try to watch the various episodes.

I enjoyed but was not fascinated by Series 1. I hadn't planned to get Series 2 but the last episode ended with such a strong cliffhanger that I just had to see how it all turned out. Fortunately, I think Series 2 is more interesting and it has kept my attention.",1315267200,,1608,4.231270358306189

Their questionable behaivor isn't a simple answer of weather or not they should do something that is either illegal or unehtical with the potential payoff for the betterment of society, ala Jack Bauer. The characters are flawed people, just like real life.  They're all heros if caught at the right time, but also fail both ethically and morally.

Update...I have to amend what I said about less brutal violence.  I was horrified at what took place in episode 2 of season 1, and had to stop the video and cancel the rest of the viewing.  From what I read, the BBC got more negative phone calls about this episode than anything else.  Don't watch it if you are at all squeamish about violence.",1310256000,2,658,4.149606299212598

The first series of MI-5 purportedly takes us into the British internal (UK-centric) intelligence agency. The first series is gritty, surprisingly shocking in places, and mostly a good under-stated television drama with just enough character development that we can get attached to the personalities and just enough contravention of usual TV routine that we are sometimes shocked - at one point, very much so.

So if you want to watch a gritty spy series, this is the one to go for. But don't get too excited - after the first series, MI-5 became increasingly formulaic and silly as the stakes had to get higher and higher and the various characters began to come and go as if the ""pods"" into ""the grid"" had turned into a revolving door.",1301097600,,877,4.801324503311259

1932223,2,B0000E32UZ,"I've been recording this series for a while as it was broadcast on PBS but haven't watched any since I missed recording Season 1. Finally I bought Season 1 and am very disappointed. The plots are ridiculous and the characters seem to be unbelievably stupid. And to cover this, there's lots of annoying music, fast camera cuts and  hi-tech flash. But if you ignore these distractions and actually think about what's going on, you'll see lame plots and some unintentionally funny moments.

One of those moments came when a guy who stole information that could destroy the agency is let go because...well, because he might use that information if they don't let him go. Plus, he gave his word that he wouldn't use it. Well...all right then. Sure, they could lock him up, interrogate him, threaten him and make his life hell until he gives up the data and his associates. But, he gave his word, so nothing to worry about. I burst out laughing as he said that and they just let him walk away.

There are so many plot holes and so much nonsense that it would be difficult to list it all. The last episode was perhaps the most laughable. A terrorist who has been BLOWING THINGS UP gives an agent a laptop that contains some information. So, the agent takes it home and puts it in his desk, without suspecting a thing. Then, it turns out that his new hi-tech security system has just one little flaw. If it fails, you are locked in the house and can't get out. Because, you know, technology NEVER fails, so why have a manual backup? Well...Doesn't take a genius spy to figure out what happens next.

What happens next for me is selling Season 1 and deleting all the unwatched seasons I recorded on my DVR. Yup...It's so bad I won't even watch it for free.",1292630400,9,1747,4.5015772870662465

1932225,5,B0000E32UZ,"First ,I worry that in my review I might lack the ability to clearly and skillfully support my claims and reflect just how good this show really is
to those who have never seen it. I would hope to be able to convince you through my choice of words that I am able to present a fair snapshot that will provide you with enough information that will encourage you to follow up and that here is a show I stand by with my word that is worth the time effort and money required to purchase and watch
I hope to be able to represent the great quality and intelligence behind this show ,
and just how amazingly good it is !
I have a great love of the TV medium and have been plugged into TV for 1/2 a century now.
This show represents TV at its finest
The show revolves around a group of MI-5 Agents stationed in London MI-5 being roughly the equivalent of the American FBI  with a few distinctions
It often becomes a deeply personal story of where to draw a moral line in order to protect the citizens of both the city and country
In many ways it is often an adrenaline rush much like 24 at its best,  yet MI-5 is far more thoughtful, balanced, and intelligent. but like 24 and The Bourne identity it can be a thrill ride to match any ! or it can also move surreptitiously, quietly drawing you in slowly bringing you to the edge of your seat drawing you deeper and deeper into a web of thoughtful moral quandaries and personal sacrifice .The casting is perfection, stories that are  so real reaching out to touch you from behind headlines .
I urge any and all who like great stories of intrigue espionage ( The day of the jackal comes to mind )and the details that make it far more human than just a group out to stop a terrorist bombing or assassination  often far more complex such as undermining the economy plugging and finding leaks that could bring about catastrophic global change. How did they acquire the info ? and why did they get it? Often the information comes from other agents from other countries with differing agendas, Politicians looking to advance agendas who interfere or advance agendas of their own ( I am told written with the help of former intel agents )Once you have seen a few episodes you will understand how this must be true !And let me warn you you will not want to stop!
Outstanding ensemble acting ,Directing editing that never gets bogged down among the cleanest sharpest direction and edits I have seen in any TV production ever !
Production values are again outstanding ! use of location and color for impact or rather to help set a tone not detract but to fully depict the range of sensory involvement
Bringing me to the music, sometimes eerie and haunting, it lingers like the stories and scenes often do.
You never know what is around the next corner like life ! So what I am saying here is this show presents a unique and quite nearly perfect balance of Story,Acting,Direction,Edit,Location, Design , color ,And music. When this show is running full out it is a near work of art for the medium and at the very least some of the best TV has produced .
For most, some bits of the series linger long after you have watched I can promise that !
We often find ourselves speechless staring at the TV screen even after the show has ended mouths agape ! These can be very powerful stories not out of any mold I can think of .
You become close to these people you know the moral dilemmas they face and the prices paid for choices made, as humans we often fail but what about when the stakes are so high? what is the price of failure then ? Or knowing the price before you seek to intervene when failure cannot be an option .This gives you a wonderful peek behind the curtain of the great wizard or should I say takes you though the looking glass .They do not preach ideology they let many of the politicians do that you see the politic up close and personal. As MI-5 go about trying to protect
a nation and her people yet having to deal with many differing political realities and skirmishes between parties resulting so often in a backlash. Then of course you have diplomacy and the never ending pitfalls manipulations and the occasional great successes so clearly illustrated in this show from time to time. There you have it my humble summery taken in the big picture with all the other positive reviews I think you are safe with this even if you have never watched a show like it before .
My wife and I discovered this show many years back and have given DVDs as gifts or loaned our own .I can tell you with 100% honesty that every single person who we know who has viewed this show became a fan ! ( about a dozen as it now stands )

I debated on whether to give this series 4-stars or 5.  I am mid way through series 4 and I would rate the series on a whole to be very good-excellent.

*It may take an episode or 2 to become accustomed to the accents

Likes:
The vast majority of the plot lines are tightly woven and rely more on independent/group thought and less on physical action.  As a matter of course being that most of the hard core action is farmed out to SAS units (unlike many American series where the deep thinkers are also martial arts experts and crack shots). The main characters all have flaws.  Unfortunately, Hugh Laurie, as head of MI-6 (think CIA to the MI-5/FBI) is only with us for 1-series.  His comic wit is a precursor of what is to become ""House.""

Dislikes:
There are some uneven plot lines, which I suppose is the case with many series bar the absolute best.  New characters are brought into the series while others fall off at a greater rate than is typical with American ""hit"" series.  There may very well be a point to this, however, IMHO, this makes for some of the uneven plot lines, though it could simply come down to personal preferences in getting involved with a character(s) over a course of several seasons.

All in, I would rate the series as a must watch and would reiterate my prior advice re: purchasing a region free DVD player and checking out some of the great series on Amazon UK",1230595200,3,1681,4.44299674267101

This first season is a thrilling set of 6 episodes that catapulted the show to great heights. It's not quite as fast paced as shows like 24, but holds its own with a combination of large-scale production and wonderfully dramatic story lines.

Whilst most people focus on the grizzly ending of episode 2, watch out for the amazingly intense end to episode 6, and indeed the end of the season, where you will be on the edge of your seat until the end and then completely surprised!",1227398400,2,640,4.461538461538462

The first episode repeated the unoriginal concept that if a British drama has an American in it (especially one with a Southern accent), then the American is the guilty party and is generally an idiot or worse.  That's episode one.

Episode two was no better.  In keeping with the liberal bent of the BBC, a politician who wanted to fight illegal immigration was evil, nasty, and worse to the people who want to decide themselves where they want to live, regardless of the country they've decided to move to.

These two episodes were all that I could watch.  I stopped watching the DVD.

Forget it, not recommended at all.

UPDATE:  The subsequent series after season one have been playing on PBS.  I have to admit the second and subsequent season have been excellent.  Perhaps it was just growing pains, but I still don't like the first year of this series.

There's an incredible rate of turnover of main characters, something that's risky for the show to do and sometimes drive me crazy. Luckily they manage to toss in such interesting newcomers that I stay glued. S2 and S3 are my favorites so far. S2 because that's when the original cast hits their stride. S3 because of the jaw-dropping twists that get thrown including one of the best season-finale. The best part for me is not the glitzy cases, but the drama that churn around the characters, the way they wrestle with the demands of the job, the lack of real identity and the effects on their relationships. The cast is so top-notch, with Tom, Harry and Ruth being my favorites to watch. The worst part is the long wait time for the seasons to get to the US. If the BBC would offer it online for us, I'd gladly pay to get S7 in real time! Either way, rent or buy the dvds. It's the best way to watch as they don't edit anything out, and you get a solid 60MIN per episode without commercials. A pleasant bonus is the amount of extras they include on the Season 1-3 sets.

The real enemy is given a pass, much like on 24 or in plot lines like Jericho's (CBS).

While racists and right-wing terrorists need to be knocked out, MI-5 or Spooks as it is known abroad, does not give us a relevant and entertaining presentation of the facts. Rather, this is Hollywood fantasy with British accents and some Doctor Who-ish looking sets. Makes sense coming from a Government run television network who won't use the word ""terrorist"" in news reports in the hopes of not offending the, um, terrorists.

What MI-5 is missing is a Neil Burnside (Sandbaggers) who knows the politically incorrect truth and acts on it. We would all like protection from our enemies and MI-5 instead gives them an artistic safe harbor. The real MI-5 must be quite displeased to say the least.

Save your money and buy The Sandbaggers or anything that Le Carre produced before the Soviet Union fell. You may be offended but your mind won't be dulled by more lies in the guise of a Television program.",1195862400,13,1282,4.739910313901345

It is a visceral, indellible shocker that makes you want to reach for the antacid.  If you can stomach it, the show is exciting, smart and engaging.  The real problem - as someone already pointed out in another review - is the DVD menu.  You almost have to be a Spook to figure out how to traverse the complicated menu universe you enter in MI-5.  I was apparently too stupid to figure it all out the first few times because I ended up starting the 1st episode over and over until I finally figured out that I was in the wrong 'dosier'.  Dumb me.

1932294,4,B0000E32UZ,"I am commenting mainly about the DVD, not the show.  This is an example of one of the worst DVD intros and menus designed.  First, you have to sit through an opening intro depicting someone in a dark hood sneaking into an office.  Then, very cheesy production values abound as we have to continue and watch this intruder find a desk!  Finally, at the very normal and dull looking desk, we are given scratchy audio in prim English telling us what menu options are available.  Not paying attention? Sound down too low? Sorry.  There is no text on the main menu.

What do I click?
The mouse arrow goes over the PC screen, rolodex, audio tapes, cds, and a phone.  If you press the phone, you get another garbled announcement, which yells at you if don't press a button.  I still haven't figured out what it is.  If you fiddle around enough, you figure out that the DVDs labelled ""Program File"" are the episodes. Click the DVD case and you have to once again wait as another very uncompelling video plays of the masked man taking the DVD out of the stack (ooooh!), open it, and...put it into the DVD drive in the computer! (aaaah!).  Finally, you get what looks like real buttons. Press  ""Sector Selection"" and get chapter selections with no image or title.  Where you go in the program - your guess is as good as mine.

What I am complaining about is how DVD designers get way too complicated in their quest to make a clever DVD menu system.  In the process, especially for Americans trying understand fast spoken accented English, don't deliberately try to make the audio hard to understand, and don't deliberately remove any visual clues as to how to play an episode.

If they had concentrated on these ugly aspects of spying and governmental dysfunction, the series would be much more like the classics like the incomparable Sandbaggers.  Unfortunately the writers throw in quite a bit of boring and banal trivia concerning the love lives and of the agents and other personal details unrelated to the central aspect of spying.  Season 1 does have a nice bonus however.  You get to see Hugh Laurie as the head of MI-6 before his Dr. House fame with his British accent intact.  His personality is over the top and you can see how it appealed to the producers of House.  His character is about the best feature of season 1.  Unfortunately, he is not the focus of the show.

I was waiting for the ""neo-conservative"" to make his appearance. I also didn't like the way the characters came out and said things like ""I know what I am saying is cynical power politics, but that is just how things work"". In one scene at MI5, a cabinet-level politician says that, basically. Come on ! Politicians justify their behavior better than that. I also don't think it is necessary to show the the MI5 agents ""have home lives"". What is the point ? What, did we think otherwise that they spent all their time in the MI5 building ? It was unnecessary to show that.

In reality, the Islamic/fascist threat is growing by the day in Britain (over 200 known terror plots, and the REAL MI5 can't keep up with it all). In this fictional MI5 world, Britain is at peace, except for the occasional rightwing villain getting off the plane from Boston or New York.

I saw him in the movie, Pride and Prejudice, and thought he was brilliant. He's the type of actor you can't take your eyes off. I decided to rent the first and second seasons through Netflix and that's when I was hooked. Seeing the uncut, commercial free versions of the six episodes that make up season one made it easier to concentrate fully on them. It's the kind of series that you get so involved in, you dream you're a spy! I would find myself thinking ""this is so good"" while I was watching it. The stories are current. The actors are superb.

The plotlines of ""MI-5"" are tight and realistic and they still manage to keep you biting your nails until the end. The show strikes a good balance between the agent's personal and professional lives, and the production values are all extremely high. The acting is superb, and the pacing is perfect. What ""MI-5"" doesn't have is the completely ""over-the-top"" Hollywoodization that is so prominent in ""24.""

If you haven't seen the show before, then I strongly suggest starting with Season One and continuing in order. The chronology does matter.

Only six episodes in the first season, so it is definitely no bargain to purchase.

The production values do not meet the standard of Alias or other American spy shows.

As for the plots, they are very good. MI-5 is a more realistic series than Alias, but it seems constrained by comparison. In Alias, the characters are always jetting off to some exotic locale, James Bond-style. The spooks in MI-5 are often limited to the drudgery of computer searches, stakeouts, and trying to blend in to the scenery as they tail suspects or liase with fellow spies or CIA agents. And they stay in jolly old England.

I have a problem with the season one villains. They seem a little trite, a little too one-dimensional. This improved greatly in season two.

The team of MI-5 characters and the actors who play them are very likeable. We get to know the personal side, the motivations, and some of the strengths and weaknesses of Tom Quinn, Zoe, and Danny -- the spooks who form the core of the MI-5 series. This team is a great foundation for a recurring series of adventures, and the actors grow in confidence and believability in season two.

Season one is an above-average television spy show. I don't think the series really comes into its own until season two, where the personal dramas of the MI-5 team and the enemies they are fighting become more gripping. I think visually - in terms of cinematography - season two is an improvement as well. Everything seems to be kicked up a notch in quality after season one.

Whether or not it is a realistic view is, of course, irrelevant...it makes for very good television!! One comes to like the characters very quickly and hopes that they prevail despite having a job that makes death a very real possibility at any time...not to mention the impact the job can have on personal relationships.

I would recommend this set to anyone who loves a fast-paced look at a shady world behind the scenes. The episodes can progress at breakneck speed, and have a dark component that murder-mystery lovers will enjoy.  Be warned, however--this series isn't for the faint of heart.  Grisly death is part of being a spy, and ""MI-5"" pulls no punches in this regard.  I very much enjoyed it and am currently enjoying the second season as well...I only wish they released these DVD's faster!

(One complaint only:  the episode that features a British actress trying to affect an American southern accent was almost comical, as the accent was all wrong for her supposed state of origin.  Other than that, no complaints, as this series is quite compelling.)",1125360000,9,1152,4.871794871794871
1932396,5,B0000E32UZ,"When I played the first episode of MI-5, Volume 1, my heart sank farther and farther over the course of the next hour.  The cinematography was weirdly cheery, the villains were completely without menace, and the main characters were confusing, vaguely characterized, and seem a little too young for the genre of the show.  After this episode, I was already thinking about how much I'd fetch when I send this DVD set to a second-hand bin.

But as Episode 2 rolled along, it's like the show woke up from slumber and began to gallop.

The comparisons to 24 are a little convenient -- two espionage shows on two sides of the Atlantic, both surfacing around the crucial year of 2001?  But if you go into MI-5 expecting the ferocious action, ruthless characters, endless treacheries and gritty camera work of 24, you'd probably be a little disappointed.  MI-5 doesn't quite have the gut punch of 24 -- few shows do -- but what it does have is a very good cast, unusual plotting, a quirky sense of humour, and an eye for detail for the minutiae of life in espionage.  Also, because it's not bound to the real-time and L.A.-centric conceits of 24, MI-5 is actually broader in scope, dealing with Irish terrorists, Islam, race-motivated hate crimes, and European anarchists all within the first six episodes collected here.

While I was initially skeptical of how babyfaced the actors looked, they prove to be very fine performers.  According to the supplementary materials on the DVDs, half of the members of MI-5 in real life are under the age of 40, so in that respect, the casting would make sense.  Matthew MacFadyen, despite his soft eyes and boyish good looks, can deliver intensity and resilience which convince us he could really be the second-in-command of this section of MI-5, Keeley Hawes drips with doe-eyed beauty and great comic timing, and David Oyelowo mixes mischief and determination nicely.  The crowning member of the cast is Peter Firth as Harry Pearce, the inscrutable leader of the group; he conveys both the steely core of the character and the humanity.

I can't fathom why the pilot, with its weak, incoherent plot involving an anti-abortion terrorist with no sense of menace, was so unengaging.  But aside from this one dud, the other five episodes are in fine, engaging form.  MI-5 has its share of nail-biting scenes, the most powerful of which is the infamous Episode 2 ending, which was so harrowingly intense that it probably trumps any shock scene ever delivered by 24 -- no small feat indeed.  After that it's a fabulous ride, culminating in an Episode Six with a thrillingly broad scope, brisk pacing, and another very satisfying suspense sequence as the final course.  And throughout the episodes, the writers keep a keen eye towards the fascinating details of life as a ""spook"", an added layer of fascination which gives the show a unique character and brings us closer to what it's like being an MI-5 agent.

Aside from the unsatisfying pilot, there are just a few minor gripes:  The DVD design went nuts trying to be creative, but ends up with a design that's awkward to navigate as well as buggy -- several buttons on the menu froze up my DVD player, and none of the main-menu items are marked.  Please, next time, don't sacrifice convenient access for style.  They made a great effort to include lots of bonus materials, but the cast/crew interviews are shallow and sluggish in pace (more editing please), making all the actors seem sleepy and unfocused.  And since this set is only six episodes long, the overall arc of the episodes will seem a lot less satisfying than a full-on season.  However, these shows remain a great introduction to a show that carries all the thrills of the espionage genre, while giving it a unique spin.",1123977600,76,3766,4.788253477588872
1932397,3,B0000E32UZ,"Riddled with philosophical contradictions (*not wanting to offer a spoiler, I'll post an example of what I mean at the end*), the show also suffers from scripts that are incredibly predictable, characters that are 2-dimensional and nauseatingly self-righteousness, and villians who are really evil (but in an appropriately ""politically correct"" way).  It was not until the last 10 minutes of Episode 6 (the final for Season 1) that I was even remotely hooked.

Slick, yes.  Accurate (as far as the entertainment industry goes) on par with Matt Damon and Jason Bourne (which is to say, not much at all).  Ideologically driven, yup (even more than ""The West Wing"").

Bottom line, written to appeal to the UK's pubbin' and clubbin' twentysomethings, this is light fare and not one of the BBC's best offerings (and I am a HUGE fan of much of the BBC's catalog).  Alas, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" it is not....

*Semi-spoiler follows: For instance, in one episode the U.S. is mocked by the show's main characters/heroes for its support of capital punishment, yet barely an episode later the heroes order an assassination of someone they find unpalatable, a revenge killing at that, and no one can see the hypocrisy of it all, never mind the irony",1123459200,8,1245,4.956730769230769

1932444,5,B0000E32UZ,"I first became addicted to this show, known as Spooks in the UK, when it first appeared on A&E.  MI-5 is an example of television at its finest.  This show gives us a fictional insider view of Britian's domestic intelligence division known as MI-5, and we're not talking James Bond (anyway, he was MI-6).  This show presents these people as patriots fighting to keep their country safe, but it's also not afraid to present the morally questionable side, as well -- not something you usually see on American television.  In the US, when a show like this is made it treats the players as heroes making a great sacrifice to keep the country safe, rarely as human beings who sometimes have to make morally questionable decisions, decisions that force them to question whether they are doing the right thing or not.  Shows like Alias and 24 come close, but they are more thriller shows with thriller plots and violence.  This show works in real-time, often using real-time events as catalyst for their plots.  What sets this show apart from the likes of Alias and 24 is the human factor:  the series focuses more on the human drama than it does the thriller elements.  Matthew MacFadyen is absolutely wonderful as Tom Quinn, who over time begins to wonder about the decisions he's had to make and the affect they've had on his life and those around him. Keeley Hawes as Zoe Reynolds, David Oyelowo as Danny Hunter, and Peter Firth as Harry Pearce are exceptional supporting players.  Don't let the British setting keep you from watching this series.  Unlike any show currently on television in America, based in America, this series reminds us there is still a war on terror and we're only moments away from another disaster.

Horribly bereft of irony, its attempts at action are feeble and the reviewer who mentioned Le Carre should really watch Tinker Tailor, Soldier Spy again, very soon. George Smiley would run rings around these children.

Series 1 contains one of the most sickeningly manipulative twists ever committed by a cynical scriptwriter desperate for ratings, and each series ends in the most preposterous manner since Blake's 7 dispatched it's entire cast with monotonous regularity.

Now that I've seen the entire first season on DVD, I can't say that I was really all that excited about seeing what happens in the next episode.

1932480,4,B0000E32UZ,"There've been some uncommonly intelligent spy films produced by British television: TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE (both starring Sir Alec Guinness as the owlish George Smiley), and THE SANDBAGGERS miniseries. In all three, the agency involved is Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service (MI-6). The operatives are a tweedy lot, and the headquarters, either at the old ""Circus"" or the more modern Century House, are, like the remains of Empire, comfortably shabby. Thus, it was with some misgivings that I began MI-5, the ongoing glitzy miniseries featuring the SIS's less glamorous sister also known as the Security Service, which like America's FBI, deals with domestic intelligence, anti-subversion and counter-terrorism. The glitz is of Hollywood proportions - almost, for me, an instant turn-off. I'm glad I stuck with it.

The lead ""spook"" is Tom Quinn, played by Matthew MacFadyen. He runs an undercover operations team, the most prominent members of which are Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) and Danny Hunter (David Oyelowo). The interior of MI-5's London HQ, Thames House, is ultramodern and high tech; the CIA probably never had it so good. Tom's boss is the hardboiled and sphinx-like Harry Pearce, played by Peter Firth.

Admittedly, I didn't become engaged until episodes three and four, when I realized that the intricate scripts, fast-paced and tautly presented, transcended the glitz. I'm now hooked, and eagerly await the DVD release of the Season 2 episodes in late 2004. My only remaining complaint is the too clever lead-in to each episode which requires excessive button-pushing on the remote to navigate. I mean, just get on with it. Prince Charles will become King in a shorter time.

The storylines are contemporary: embassy take-overs by militant nationalists, insidious plots by Arab terrorists, illegal arms deals by enterprising Russians involving Whitehall cabinet officers, and the occasional appearance of IRA bombers. Gone are the good old days of KGB machinations on behalf of the Evil Empire. The episodes are slickly written with surprising plot twists. And MI-6 across the river maintains a scheming and patronizing presence.

Part of the show's attraction is that it doesn't paint its MI-5 heroes as perfect. They have relationship problems; they embezzle money from the Service; and perhaps have dark secrets in the past that invite blackmail during intra-office power struggles. Why, it sounds like any company I've ever worked for!

It'll make you think twice before installing that elaborate security system on your house, or at least make you aware of the dangers posed by a small child when catalyzed by chocolate icing.",1092355200,157,2753,5.261958997722096
1932481,5,B0000E32UZ,"MI-5 is first-rate. The script writing is crisp, clean, and edgy. The characters are, as you might expect from the British, understated, cool, and witty.

The characters are engaging and the viewer is slowly drawn into their personal dramas. The last scene of the first season is an emotional cliff-hanger. I have been reliving that scene for more than week - can't get it out of my mind. Can't shake the riveting drama of it all.

The plots are good. For a believer, there is a good bit of  anti-Christian sentiment which is difficult. But Britain itself is rather like that these days- a bit cynical, jaded, and even sardonic. But at the bottom of it all, there is love, faith, and a resilient optimism which rebounds the soul, if not the spirit.

There is excellent balance between dramatic tension and action/adventure. This is not pretty-blonde-on-the-arm James Bond stuff. This show has an edge of steel.

We are fortunate in Australia to be about the only place in the world where season 2 has been available on DVD for some time. Excellent cast and scripts. Well worth the money and sits somewhere between John Le Carre and James Bond. Thoroughly realistic. A must for the collections of anybody interested in this genre.

This is a terrific little series so far. I love it. Definitely a keeper... probably something everyone and their mother is going to want to borrow, then wind up getting a copy of for themselves.",1078012800,2,797,4.659574468085107
1932513,5,B0000E32UZ,"Televisions shows don't come more exciting, suspenseful, or addictive than MI-5, originally titled Spooks when it aired on BBC in the UK. This show follows the exploits of Section B of MI-5, the British equivalent of the CIA, as they battle terrorists of all shapes and forms. What elevates this show above its American brethren is its refusal to sugarcoat the storylines. Characters, even the regulars, betray each other, crack under pressure, succumb to temptation, struggle with difficult decisions, and make ruthless choices that we imagine are necessary in the real world of espionage. Happy endings are neither required nor welcome.
There are only six episodes over 3 DVDs in this box set of Season 1, but what a 6 episodes they are. I never saw the edited versions that aired on A&E in the US (10 minutes were cut from each episode), but fortunately these DVDs contain the uncut versions of all 6 episodes. I'm hooked and dying for Season 2 to arrive on DVD (it will include the next 10 episodes). The last episode, in particular, will blow your mind with its ending.
Alias, with its romanticized storylines, is spycraft-light compared to MI-5 which recalls for me the addictive pace of 24 in its first two seasons, before it descended into recursive silliness. I have just two complaints. One is the convoluted DVD menu which simulates a spy breaking into a computer room. It takes forever for the actual DVD menu options to come up, and after you've been through it once you'll wish you could bypass it and just get to the programs. And secondly, I can't believe I have to wait for season 2 to come out on DVD.",1077667200,11,1619,4.724381625441696
1932514,5,B0000E32UZ,"This set is indeed all of Season 1 -- BBC only produced six episodes for season 1. Season 2 contains 10 episodes (as will Season 3, due to air in the UK in Autumn 2004).
Better than Alias (which I love) and heads and shoulders above ""The Agency"" this show is slick and fast paced.",1077148800,3,280,4.109090909090909
1932515,5,B0000E32UZ,"This show is awesome! It has the BBC ""slow burn"" effect. It starts out so-so and then suddenly you're hooked. The uncut episodes are a must have. It really gives you a feel for how the show was supposed to be shown. The DVD menu is horrible. I mean really really bad.
The most frustrating thing is that this is only six episodes. It's ""Volume 1"" not ""Season 1"". There's 14 episodes in all. So we have at least another collection to buy to get the whole season. Making the total cost over $80 (if there's two more volumes we'd break $100 bucks). A little much for only 14 episodes.
They're lucky I love the show so much.",1076976000,4,619,4.254237288135593
1932516,5,B0000E32UZ,"I just watched the DVDs today, and if you are a fan at all of espionage/action/mystery shows, I recommend this series. It is great to watch on TV, but these DVDs have the entire episodes that were shown on the BBC, but had parts cut out for the American release (on A&E) for commercial breaks. Watching the extended episodes is wonderful...like new episodes or more in depth episodes. The extras are great to watch, especially the interviews with the cast members and how they talk about their careers and their characters. The only problem I had with the DVDs is that the menus don't tell you which episode is which, but that is such a minor thing to me, since it is a delight to have one of my absolute favorite shows on DVD to watch whenever I need a MI-5 fix, since there haven't been new episodes in ages and it is never on when I want to watch it. I definitely recommend that this DVD series be added to your collection if you are into spy/action series.",1074470400,17,960,4.368715083798882
1932517,3,B0000E32UZ,"I was thrilled when this came out in dvd in a format for US viewing and pre-ordered it immediately, have really enjoyed seeing the uncut episodes in order to get all the details.  The only criticism is the overly complicated menu in order to get to the episodes, you put the disk in and wait for a menu to appear, and instead you get a picture of a desk top, and then you realize a voice is droning in the background and what it's muttering are instructions on how to get to the episodes.  There are a lot of extra features, but they're included in the overly cute menu packaging where you have to either try to pay attention to the voice or consult the 3-page outline included in the packaging, and then click on the feature you want and wait an unusually long time for it to load.  It would have been a lot more convenient if they had run the episodes on the first two disks, and put all the extra features on the third.  After all the work that went into the over-complicated menu, the actual packaging is cheap and I had to break one of the plastic tabs to release one of the dvd's.  But if you love the show by all means get the dvds in order to see the episodes in entirety.",1074470400,31,1180,4.157894736842105
1932518,5,B0000E32UZ,"Initially I saw one of the episodes of the second season involving a US Presidential trip to England on ""A & E"". The show was brilliant. The only problem was that it was about 42 minutes long, cut from a British running time of about 58 minutes.
I bought the British edition of the first season (6 episodes)and was not disapointed. Watching Tom try to handle his love life and his job was fascinating. Not to mention the problems of his two subordinates and his boss. The only thing that I regret was not watching the shows from the beginning.
""Star Trek"" had the infamous ""reset"" button. No matter what happened last week, the characters did not really change. Here they clearly grow on preceding episodes with the basic story being self-contained. You catch the nuances by watching all the episodes in the correct order.
I suspect that this show would bomb on network TV. This is a criticism of US network TV, not of Spooks.
The third season of 10 episodes is in production. Season two(10 episodes) of the unedited version is supposed to be released on DVD in conjuction with the new season. I already have a standing order to request it. That is how highly I recommend it.",1073779200,9,1175,4.57345971563981
