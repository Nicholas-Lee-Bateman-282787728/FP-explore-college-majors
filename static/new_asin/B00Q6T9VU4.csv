8690570,1,B00Q6T9VU4,"I thought it was a good price for the amount of movies I was getting but it turned out the movies were well below ""B-movie"" standards.  If you watch a lot of movies you know that there are block-buster movies, there are good movies, OK movies, ""B-movies"", so bad it's good movies and after a few more levels there are the movies that you watch a few minutes of and want to claw your eyes out.  The last type are the ones that are in this pack (for me).  I can handle a lot in a movie that makes it bad to everyone except the ones making it but I think even the crew(s) that made these hated themselves afterwards.

I'm sorry for being so harsh but if I wanted really bad movies I could watch the same types through my prime or nf subscriptions (both have good movies also).",1469318400,,773,4.133333333333334
8690571,1,B00Q6T9VU4,"You could do worse, but I am not sure how. These are all one and two star horror films, most without much horror. The acting is sad in the lot of these low budget stinkers that can no long sell individually and cover the price of the packaging. All five are on 1 convenient disc.",1446508800,2,279,4.090909090909091

8690573,3,B00Q6T9VU4,"Enjoyable B movies. If you are looking for an A movie don't watch these. Ok for just enjoyable watching, try not to over think them and you will be happy to watch them, probably not re-watch them but good for a once viewing.",1428969600,,224,4.232558139534884
8690574,1,B00Q6T9VU4,"The worst group of horror movies I ever watched! ""Farm"" not only the actors are terrible, (I mean TERRIBLE = BAD ACTORS) the makeup is awful. I saw much better costumes on children in Halloween,  no special effects makeup at all!. ""Evidence of a Haunting"", is the worst of the four movies, is a joke to call it movie! actors, well...are they actors?  ""Ominous"", the actors are just terrible! Deadrise is not bad, has good actors but is a boring movie! Meadowoods is the best of the group of four movies, along, I would give it two and a half stars..",1426291200,4,549,4.425742574257426
