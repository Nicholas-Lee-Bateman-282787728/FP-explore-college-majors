2822981,3,B000PHX5P0,"If you like one, you'll like the other.  If you like what you expect to like from this type of film you'll like them.  They're OK.  Nothing great though.",1265932800,,153,4.206896551724138
2822982,5,B000PHX5P0,This is a fantastic movie and had me in tears laughing thru most of the movie.,1261180800,,78,3.9375
2822983,5,B000PHX5P0,"Tommy Boy and Black Sheep were two of the best movies of Chris Farley, and now they are sold together for a great price! One side of the DVD is Tommy Boy and the other is Black Sheep, so you have to be careful to not touch the DVD. It has many deleted scenes and outtakes that are hilarious. Good for the Chris Farley fan or anyone who liked either one of these movies.",1206835200,11,369,4.0
2822984,5,B000PHX5P0,"Two of the funniest movies Chris Farley ever made, on one DVD, at a great price. Why read the reviews? Buy this DVD!! Did I eat paint chips as a kid? Hahaha.......why?",1201478400,4,167,4.25
2822985,5,B000PHX5P0,Move was great my son really enjoyed it and the fact that was two movies was really kool...,1199577600,,91,4.111111111111111
2822986,5,B000PHX5P0,"If you like Chris Farley and his physical brand of humor, these two are for you. We have falling down mountains, getting stuck in airplane doors, getting stuck in trunks lids, being crushed by refrigerators and slamming fingers in a car hood. . . how much better does it get than that! And that's just a few of the ""gags"". I'm a fairly educated guy and I certainly like cerebral humor but you just cannot watch Farley when he is ""on"" and not laugh.

When you think your life is going all wrong, just plug in this DVD and things will get better!",1195948800,10,544,4.281553398058253

2823011,5,B000PHX5P0,"I so love Chris Farley. This is got to be his best movie ever. I have watched this over and over and over and over again. Whenever I need to laugh I just throw on Tommy Boy. Fat guy in a little coat, LOL he is so funny. You have to be dead not to like this movie. It's hilarious.",1463184000,,279,3.6666666666666665

2823013,5,B000PHX5P0,Love when he rolled down the hill and when the bird poop caused the boulder to fall and knock their cabin off its foundation. I laugh so hard each time I see it or even think of it. I miss this guy. A good way to keep his memory alive. Wish he was still making movies and doing SNL down by the river. Miss you big guy! Keep em laughing up in Heaven.,1455926400,,349,3.7945205479452055

2823058,1,B000PHX5P0,"Tommy Boy is a bigtime favorite, but this dreadful DVD looks awful. Pehaps if you have an old 20"" Sony it'll look satisfactory, but if not, choose another version!",1385942400,,163,4.655172413793103
2823059,5,B000PHX5P0,Funny movie given as gift. Less expensive than running around looking for it in a local store. Yada Yada Yada,1383696000,,109,4.5
2823060,5,B000PHX5P0,"Chris Farley and David Spade act so well together! Both movies are funny, but one just takes the cake. I brought these for myself, but my kids (14 & 12) enjoyed them too. Just good, clean fun! I was pleased =)",1380240000,,209,4.121951219512195

2823064,5,B000PHX5P0,"I have seen many commercials showing Chris doing his thing. Man, is he funny! I didn't see them (Chris and David) on SNL because I worked the swing (1500-2300) shift.",1363046400,,166,4.566666666666666

2823067,5,B000PHX5P0,"This movie was alvays a favorite of mine and, after watching again after some years, still is. Black Sheep is not quiet of the same caliber but still fun to watch. A good buy!",1360454400,,175,4.176470588235294

2823071,5,B000PHX5P0,It was a brilliant plan on the part of the sellers of this film to package these films together because they are literally the same film.  Literally!,1353456000,,149,4.518518518518518
2823072,5,B000PHX5P0,"I love Chris Farley, especially when he's with David Spade. Even having seen these movies hundreds of times in the last 18-some years, I laugh every time. And on blu-ray, I even saw things that I had never noticed in the movie before.",1298073600,,234,4.465116279069767
2823073,5,B000PHX5P0,I ordered this DVD for my brother for his birthday.  He loves Chris Farley and Amazon.com is the cheapest place I could find Chris Farley movies.  The shipping was super fast!!!  Will definitely buy from Amazon.com again!!!,1288051200,,223,4.972972972972973
2823074,5,B000PHX5P0,"I know there are better duo's but to me David Spade and Chris Farley are my favorite next to Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. Tommy boy is such a classic of a movie. It has a great feel through the whole movie and it WILL keep you laughing. Black Sheep is a bit wackier then Tommy Boy and lacks that good feeling, however, the guys still deliver and its hilarious. I was hoping for remastered but it seems both of these were just up-scales of the original. But if you enjoy these movies you should get them on blu ray its always nice to watch something you enjoy in a better quality i suppose. It has great special features for Tommy Boy. WORTH THE PURCHASE if that's what you wanted to know.",1284508800,3,690,4.234848484848484
2823075,5,B000PHX5P0,"A classic funny movie duo!  Everyone should see Tommy Boy at least once!  Chris Farley is hilarious ""fat guy in a little coat""!  Classic!",1269475200,,137,4.625
2823076,1,B000PHX5P0,"The double movies:  Tommy Boy and Black Sheep were bought as a gift. The gift however, was not in good condition.  the disc would only play ""Black Sheep"" and ""Tommy Boy"" would not play at all.  Since it was a gift and sent out of my area, I could not complain and return the product.  I will not get ""burned"" again by Amazon for DVDs",1266969600,,333,4.076923076923077
