5111595,5,B007VOVTQC,"I have been waiting for decades to see this movie again.  It was one of the most amazing horse movies of its time.  All the horse crazy girls went wild over it-- Dreaming of one day being able to jump a wonderful horse like Nautilus.  Thank you Walt Disney for bringing it back.

It was wonderful to see the amazing skill of riders of the American team in a gentler time in riding history.  Their form was textbook perfect  It was a beautiful film to watch.  Full of equine history and fashion.  Imagine riding without helmets!  I still have one of those velvet caps!  And the breeches were before stretch material came along!

My father couldn't bear my crying as I watched this movie and promised me a horse when I was 13.  And on that birthday I received my horse!",1441929600,9,767,4.361702127659575

5111600,2,B007VOVTQC,"I love Disney movies, and my husband and I snatch up the classics as fast as we can.  I'd never seen this one before, so we took a chance based on all the reviews.  It was so boring that both me and my husband turned it off and went to sleep before the end.  We've NEVER done that before with a Disney movie.  We're kids at heart and are very easily amused, so we were surprised to find a Disney movie that was such a disappointment.  If you saw it growing up, I'm sure the nostalgia makes the movie very special, and if you absolutely love anything to do with horses, you may have a similar love for the movie, but I had never seen it and was not expecting a 45 minute documentary with so-so picture quality.",1430438400,3,709,4.108695652173913

5111622,5,B007VOVTQC,I saw this on Disney when I was 5 or 6 and never forgot it. I've been looking for it and was happy when I found it.  There are a few corny moments but worth watching if you love horses and especially if you are into jumping. This is a true story. You can't make this stuff up.  If you like the horse Snowman story you will love this.,1406073600,,333,3.8115942028985508

5111629,4,B007VOVTQC,This is an interesting story about a horse with a big personality.  It's an older film so don't order it if a cheesy and dated film bothers you.  Clips of the real Nautical are enjoyable.,1395187200,6,187,4.314285714285714

5111631,5,B007VOVTQC,"The film from real shows ""back in the day"" is priceless if you're a hunter/jumper person.  The courses, the horses and the incredibly correct riders are a great treat to watch as well as providing teachable moments for students of the forward seat.  Fun, fun, fun.  The jumps were huge!",1393891200,8,286,4.68

5111641,5,B007VOVTQC,"I first saw this short documentary as a feature in the theater and was captivated by this palomino and his story, because I also had a palomino colt that I was breaking in. The world of show jumping in the late 1950's and early 1960's was so exciting and wonderful.  Hugh Wiley and the other USET men were so good! And riders like Harry de Leyer were jaw-dropping.  Although I rode Western and lived in the Midwest, I did a lot of work getting my horse to jump - creeks and low fences. This is the documentary that everyone who enjoys show jumping should watch.",1373846400,,561,4.333333333333333

The gentleman who saved Indian Joe nameded the horse Nautical. I cried when I saw how he was mistreated. Thank you Disney. This is a lovely movie, a fine movie and as a child I was intrigued that America the Beautiful was played instead of the loud Star Spangled Banner. Never thought this would ever be released in DVD.

Whether you watched ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" in the 50's/60's it doesn't matter but if you love horses you will love this true documentary--it's maybe 45 minutes to an hour long.  Injun Joe, this beautiful Palomino, goes from a cow pony/cutting horse in New Mexico through many hands until he reaches the ones that will change his future with the U.S.  Equestrian Team in Germany at the Royal International Horse Show & in London at the 1959 Pan American Games where he gets his chance when his stable mate Master William who won in 1958 comes up lame.
