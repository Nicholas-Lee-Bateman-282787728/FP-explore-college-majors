6963763,1,B00S80X0C4,GREAT movies but the price is nothing short of robbery. Don't purchase this early. Too many other options are coming from different sources for 60-70% less.,1424563200,20,156,5.038461538461538
6963764,2,B00S80X0C4,"It is no accomplishment to walk into a movie expecting to dislike and to dislike it.  I never expected to like Peter Jacksons Hobbit trilogy.  I gave up any hope of that as soon I heard that he was turning a 300-page book into a 9-hour movie.  I didn't even watch the movies all the way through until I started this series.  So, sure, I didn't like it.  But I expected the movies to be mediocre, and they arent.  Theyre awful.

I could go on a long rant here, but these movies aren't worth it.  I could break down what went wrong from a film perspective, but these movies aren't worth it.  (And I don't really care about the film side of it.)  I could break down everything wrong with the storytelling, but these movies aren't worth it.  I could refute each of the arguments by Jacksons apologists one by one, but these movies aren't worth it.

These are flabby, flabby movies, and I don't have time to cut through all that fat.  The bottom line is that it was always an obviously wrong move to try to stretch the story past one movie.  Peter Jackson had the juice after the overwhelming success of The Lord of the Rings to get the The Hobbit done right.  But he didn't care.

One of the remarkable things about The Hobbit is that it is always earnest and epic at the same time hes taking the piss out of, say, Gandalf.  Jacksons movies are silly and unserious without ever being funny.  They are full of interminable action scenes without ever being epic.  You might think that surely Jackson will take advantage of those 9 hours at least.  You would be wrong.  He rushes through Queer Lodgings and Flies and Spiders, my two favorite chapters from the book.  The long runtime allows him to incorporate material from the appendices, but that stuff (1) isn't any good and (2) takes up surprisingly little time.

You know you're in trouble when we get to the trolls.  Not that it doesnt take long enough, given how much filler Jackson stuffs into the beginning.  We get an awful fight scene with the dwarves.  Which leads to a bit of a problemhow do you get from an all-out fight to thirteen dwarves captive with no one getting hurt?  Jackson has the trolls seize Bilbo and threaten to pull his arms off.  The same Hobbit they will happily send alone into the dragons lair after he has won their respect.  So the dwarves trade a fight they are winning for almost certain death.  Azog should have just grabbed Thror and held him hostage.  He could have captured the entire dwarven host.

I kind of stopped taking notes at this point, to be honest.

Jackson thought the first movie moved too fast, so naturally the second starts before the first even begins.

Jackson robbed us of that great sequence with the wargs and then the orcs, replacing suspense with a silly action.  And now he robs of us the wonderful introduction to Beorn.  And, of course, Jackson thoroughly cocks up one of the very best parts of the Hobbit, Mirkwood.  Jackson sprints through in favor of elves (always a weakness of Jacksons vision, particularly here).  Then he squanders a huge amount of time in Laketown.

Then badly fumbles Smaugs attack on Laketown.

By the third movielong breaks between movies notwithstandingIve been worn down.  Ive moved beyond hate-watching to watching in a torpor as a defense mechanism.  So close to finishing, I was sorely tempted to turn the movie offforever.

People will say, oh, its okay that its 9 hours, because Jackson adds in material from the appendices and other canonical materials.  He does.  Some.  He adds much more of his own, and it shows.  Not only that, but he dramatically changes effectively every major sequence from the book.  You might say that it needed to to match The Lord of the Rings movies tonally, but heres the thingthe end result doesnt match The Lord of the Rings in tone at all.

You would think that it would at least look great.  But preproduction was hugely rushed and it shows.  The effects are noticeably worse.  The worst stuff from the first trilogy is still herethe elves and the wargs.  Between Beorn and the dwarves, Peter Jackson has something against beards.

Jackson turns Bilbos story into Thorins story.  There were hints of this with Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings movies, but the problem is much, much worse here.

Good things: Balin.  Riddles in the dark.  Initial reveal of Smaug.  Beorn jumping off of a giant eagle.",1527897600,,4378,4.574193548387097

6963868,4,B00S80X0C4,"I was very critical of the first part of this trilogy that I saw in the non-extended version. You will find this critique under the first title of this trilogy. Here I am going to consider the full trilogy.

I maintain the idea that it was a bad idea to dilute the very short and dense novel by Tolkien, The Hobbit, into a never ending trilogy. Of course we are told it is not an adaptation of the novel but a film that is realized after the novel by Tolkien, and I must here say the dilution is important and it does not respect the intensity of the original work. But why not after all?

Thats just the right question to ask.

The psychology of the characters is very often reduced to some simple sketches that are more part of the costume the actors wear, part of the characters and not something having any depth, any contradictory inner voice. Even the Hobbit himself is rather sketchy. He is predictable. He is in no way moved by deep sentiments that are expressed in a way or another on the screen. He does not have time to do this since he is absolutely all the time taken in a wild action that has no pause whatsoever, reducing the dialogue to nothing most of the time, grunts and growls most of the rest of the time, and here and there a few words often spoken in vain.

And that is the main characteristic of this trilogy.

It all starts with a Rune written on the Hobbits door by the wizard on his first visit. This Rune is Fehu under its Germanic name or Feoh under its Anglo-Saxon name, and it is not reversed. But we are not explained the meaning of this Rune. The basic meaning is cattle which relates it to the post ice age agricultural evolution, the domestication of the wild bovines and thus the evolution of that new species that will provide food and comfort to human beings. It is easy to understand then that it means wealth and all that can be derived from that concept, such as fulfillment, not only the satisfaction of ones hunger, but also the satisfaction of all basic needs and further on the satisfaction of ones call to the wild and adventure. This is basic in the whole vision provided at the beginning, though it is not explained clearly and it is not explained again at the end when the Hobbit arrives home and finds out all his accumulated wealth has been sold to everyone who wanted it. Satisfied in adventure and fate since he fulfilled his destiny, he is totally ruined in his material possessions and his house has been legally and commercially looted. Thats the kind of meaning we do not get and thats how we can say that this rune represents this motto: Every beginning has within it the seeds of its own end. And the seeds can be the negation of the beginning, or its reversal because a Rune can always be drawn upside down, reversed.

In other words it is perfectly representative of the ambiguity of runic culture, the very culture Tolkien is looking for in his novel. This fehu rune is the symbol of the call to some fate that leads to a dragon through fire, seas, storms and all other dangers from armies and other species and the fehu destiny is to kill the dragon. The killing of Smaug was contained in that rune written on the Hobbits door by this visiting wizard. I did not find one moment when this was explained. You can tell me thats the whole story. Sure. But in Tolkiens mind and in his creations, there had to be some pondering and understanding of the ambiguity of these missions and of their greatness in their being ambiguous, hence requiring at any moment, at any step a resourcing of oneself into the power of the mission, into the blood of the dragon.

But my main criticism is that action is made dominant. There is nothing but action, meaning danger and violence. Even the Orcs must have a mind and must have some psychology. They are reduced to an army of brutal and brutish automats, the perfect killers who cannot die, though on the screen quite many will die at high speed.

This insistence on the warlike aspect of the story erases the magic of the wizard and even the courage and imagination of the dwarfs and the Hobbit. Then it is all special effects that are supposed to be so striking that we are stunned into deafness, which explains why there is no dialogue. Why should there be in a story that is reduced to calamities and military fighting with in-between all types of other fighting, always for life, always to death. And the thirteen original dwarfs, squared up by the Hobbit who makes them fourteen, and the wizard who makes them fifteen, will only be ten left squared up to twelve by the Hobbit and the wizard. And that dozen is of course so symbolical of perfection that we cannot in any way hesitate: we have reached salvation though there is no prophet, no God, no Son of God, no Holy Virgin either. This parable of Christianity does not find the religious and ritual dimension it could not ignore in Tolkiens world. This film is alas absolutely deprived of any religious and spiritual dimension.

If you like special effects, thats your trilogy. If you like spectacular battles, thats your trilogy. If you like simple people who do not question the universe too much, thats your trilogy. And to make it square: if you like films that do not contain anything erotic, sexy or even simply fleshy, hence if you like puritanical human beings, thats your trilogy.

It does not matter if Tolkien is betrayed in this trilogy, since Tolkiens son made a tremendous amount of money. To defend himself he explained that he had donated a lot to various charities. Good for him. But Tolkien, his father, deserved a better service, more spiritual, more inspired by love, friendship and empathy instead of the light sprinkling of these seven and a half hours with rare and extremely superficial and evanescent references or simple allusions to such human feelings, certainly not actions or behaviors. The dragon is beautiful but he is absolutely unlovable, and actually unhatable because one cannot hate something one does not love.

6963875,4,B00S80X0C4,"As far as the film itself goes, I enjoyed the extended version. There are book scenes that were cut in favor of endless action and slow motion moments that helped to flesh out character. It really makes one wonder why some of the choices were made the way they were made. For instance in Rivendell, the cute dwarf is making eyes at an elf girl then is teased about it and he then denies he is attracted to elf girls- it is just a little bit but it sets up the later romance. Lots of little bits that would have made the theatrical version stronger films. So- as someone who thoroughly enjoyed the extended versions of LOTR, this was right up my alley. Though it is still not as good- with re-editing it could be an excellent 4 hour film. As is it is, it milks too many bits to the point of being ridiculous. (In the midst of a battle are you really going to stop and give your old friend a hug and have a conversation? While friends are dying are you really going to stop and chat? Elves are really cool but can they really upend all laws of physics?) That said, the extra scene-work was interesting to someone like me.

With regard to physical packaging, it is much more cheaply done than the LOTR packaging. The case that holds all three was kind of crunched and the paper starting to peel off. So would give two stars for the packaging. The individual CD cases were better but still not as well done as the LOTR cases.",1463702400,52,1421,4.262962962962963

6963882,5,B00S80X0C4,"I know many have/had issues with this trilogy.
Personally, I knew it was coming from a book meant for a junior audience so I expected it to be lower brow than LOTR.
I also absolutely love the fact that it was made at all, there was serious doubt for a while.
Could it have been better? Sure.
Is it worth purchasing? Absolutely.
Since Amazon.ca wanted the equivalent of a mortgage payment (again) for the Extended 3D edition, I purchased from Amazon.com.
I'm absolutely delighted with the films as presented on disc.
The 3D is predominantly subtle ( as I suggest it should be) and my 60"" plasma with my surround stereo provided an impeccable experience that was FAR FAR better than that provided by the movie theatre.
Of course, the 2D version of each film is included and after initial viewing in 3D, suffices for me for repeat viewing.
The extras are vast and would eat up a week-end to view. Lots of fun though, as PJ always instills a sense of humour in his presentations.
Do I want the Silmarillion to be made into a movie?
Well what JRRT geek wouldn't?
But maybe 10 years from now (same break as LOTR and Hobbit believe it or not).
And to make even just 3 films, we would need a helluva prologue ( and epilogue) via narration, with just a focus on the battles, with the Beren, Turin and Gondolin stories the focus of each film in the trilogy.

I received the edition I wanted - partly as I made sure of the release date. If you want the 3D extended box set do the same. Make sure it was the edition released on 17 November 2015, and that it is the most expensive. If you see a cheaper option it isn't this set.

My only complaint has to do with the digital content.  Flixster is the service that you have to sign up for to get this content.  I don't know if anyone is familiar with this company or not but I will let you know what happened with me.  I went to the web address to redeem my code.  To redeem the code you have to sign up with two different sites.  UltraViolet and Fllixster Then you have to link this two sites together.  When I first created my account, I filled in all the required fields and then tried to submit it.  It rejected my password and of course it didn't bother to give any parameters for what constituted a proper password at first then it didn't tell me why the password I entered wasn't valid.  I eventually figured that out.  Then for some reason it automatically linked to my facebook page taking the email address from that instead of letting me enter it myself.  Finally got my email address changed to the one I wanted to use for the service (again by trial and error as they don't have any assist dialog boxes to help with any FAQ's or tips for assisting you as you go.  I finally puzzled out how to correctly link the two services and when I went to view my titles in the library it was empty.  In spite of the many times it asked for and I entered the redemption code.  I thought that maybe it just takes a bit for a new account to get set up and came back the next day.  Still not there.  That was the final straw for me.  I opened a chat box to customer support (yet another fun exercise in trying to figure out with no helpful tips anywhere) and let them know the problems I had and my total dissatisfaction with their service and that I would not be back and planned to warn everyone against even trying their service.

6963976,1,B00S80X0C4,I can't agree enough with waiting. I did purchase the original LoTR just to repurchase the extended versions later. I have purchased both Hobbit 1 and 2 in the 3D extended versions and will wait for the 3rd extended version to be released.

6963978,5,B00S80X0C4,"Whenever there's a home video release of The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit films, there are a load of people complaining that we don't get the Extended Versions at the same time as the Theatrical Cuts on home video. Some people even question why they bother releasing the theatrical cut at all.

Here's the thing: is Warner Brothers just not supposed to release the theatrical cut? With a few exceptions, every other movie that gets an extended cut gets the theatrical cut released as well. Most extended cuts outside of this franchise are just a few minutes longer and can be achieved through seamless branching. However, many of them do not require the extra attention Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth films demand. Peter Jackson takes a long time to get the theatrical cut finished, the first Hobbit film was finished just two days before its premiere. Thus, he needs that extra time to get the Extended version finished, not to mention the wealth of bonus features that accompany it.

So, is there just supposed to be no home video edition until the Extended Version is out there? The theatrical editions contain the formerly online production vlogs and trailers and music videos, allowing you to make that nicely produced content part of your home video collection. The Extended Editions don't contain these at all. This means that while you do pay twice for the same film if you buy both, you're getting two different cuts of the film and two very different sets of bonus features.

And also, that's the point: Warner Brothers is not forcing anyone to purchase the theatrical cut. If you want it, it's out there a few months after the movie came out in theaters. If you want the Extended version only, you can wait until it's ready. And yet we see so many complaints about this that the scores of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films are surprisingly low on Amazon, flooded by reviews complaining that we don't get both at the same time and wondering why Warner Brothers is so ""greedy"" for making complete sets of the theatrical editions available. These reviews are also rated highly and show up on the top reviews rather than any actually helpful reviews that actually give potential buyers an idea of what to expect from their purchase.

Also annoying is that these complaints continue and we are six movies into this now nearly completed franchise (just waiting for the extended cut of the last movie and the pretty much guaranteed extended edition box set).

And also new, people who don't understand how Ultraviolet works: you set up an account on the Ultraviolet website, create an account (or multiple accounts) with digital online video retailers that support Ultraviolet (Flixster, Vudu, CinemaNow, etc.), link your accounts, redeem your Ultraviolet codes through those retailers, and depending on what devices you have (my Blu-Ray player can stream Vudu and CinemaNow), you can stream the movie over an internet connection to your device, or download on mobile devices for offline playback. (Specific retailers have different requirements, though.) I find this take on digital copy to be much nicer than downloading a 2-3+ GB file to my computer.

As this review will pop up on all versions of the Theatrical Cut trilogy, let me talk about the different packages (all contain Ultraviolet codes):

The 3D Trilogy set: You get 6 discs that contain the 3D versions of each film, split across two discs for the best picture quality. Then, you get three discs with the movie on 2D Blu-Ray and three DVD copies of the movie. Then, there are three bonus feature discs on Blu-Ray. If you want the Theatrical Cuts in 3D and haven't bought any individually, this is the way to go. But at 15 discs, it's a bulky package. Still, it's a bit less shelf space than all three individual sets.

The 2D Trilogy set: Amazon doesn't seem to have this in stock, but this is basically the same as above, just minus the six 3D discs. 3 movie discs on 2D Blu-Ray, 3 movie discs on DVD, and 3 bonus feature Blu-Ray discs.

The DVD set: Amazon also doesn't seem to have this in stock, but in this case, this is the leanest set possible. It's just the three movie DVDs: no bonus feature discs. If you're still using DVD only but don't care about bonus features, this is the set for you. If you want bonus features, seek out the individual releases marked as ""2-disc special editions.""

Overall, I thank Warner Brothers for putting this option out there. The main reason to complain is that they seem to have forced retailers to charge a more premium price on these releases when they first come out, starting in 2015. I do wish they had made a DVD set with the bonus features for collectors who just don't want to bother with an HD upgrade (I've totally gone Blu-Ray, but I do acknowledge that there are still DVD-only customers out there).",1433289600,102,4834,4.7304038004750595
