4112967,5,B003E1QC1I,It's what a classic ninja movie should be with plenty of action nonstop .,1436054400,,73,4.285714285714286
4112968,2,B003E1QC1I,these movies are very old school with dubbed in sound and bad action. I would not recommend these unless you feel the need for old 80's kungfu,1434326400,,142,4.296296296296297

4112973,2,B003E1QC1I,I thought that this would be a followup to the Ninja Assassins movie. Definitely not.,1424736000,2,85,4.733333333333333
4112974,3,B003E1QC1I,"When it comes to Videoasia, we all know the risks! Anyone buying from them sight unseen risks over priced, abysmal transfers crammed into junky packaging, with the added fun of the occasional misleading retitle - Silver Fox And Ninja Terminator, anyone?

Thankfully, NINJA ASSASSINS 2 avoids severe offense, especially if you can pick it up for cheap. The four films included in this set are:

Ninja Avenger (1982)
Ninja: The Battalion
Ninja: Extreme Weapons
Phoenix The Ninja (1981)

Ninja: The Battalion and Ninja: Extreme Weapons are a couple of goofy Godfrey Ho cut'n'paste epics, for those of us who can't get enough day-glo white guy NINJA action. Ninja Avenger and Phoenix The Ninja are proper films, both featuring lethal lady leads.

Ninja Avenger is presented widescreen, the rest of the films are 4:3. Everything is on a single double sided disc, two films per side, and for once the disc is labeled so you know which side you're popping in.",1354320000,8,952,4.93125

8395235,1,B003E1QC1I,I wish i had my money back. The first order arrived without a DVD inside the case. This next one arrived and it is not Ninja Assassin 2. It is some older shows that are low quality. Disappointed!,1520035200,,195,4.157894736842105
8395236,1,B003E1QC1I,This is the worst ever! I thought it was the continuing saga of Ninja Assassins but it is so bad with English Dubbing and picture quality and story line. I cant believe I bought it. I'd like to give this to someone for free.,1500940800,,224,4.113636363636363
