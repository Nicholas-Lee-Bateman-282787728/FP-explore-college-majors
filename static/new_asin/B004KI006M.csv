It is actually independent of the series, so anyone can watch it and enjoy the storyline. This is set in our curren timeline. The descendants of Hong Gil Dong work together as a family to rob from the rich. Mostly one really corrupt person. The leader is a music teacher, he does all the dangerous rope repelling etc..... . The other family members, Mom, Dad and siblings help out.  The family is organized and very high tech and has a van. The youngest son is not allowed to be involved because they want one normal child, he's in high school. But he's still studying up to help the family. The music teacher is in love with a woman who turns out to be the prosecutors sister.  So things are complicated.  I really don't want to spoil it by saying more. My husband liked this movie and he doesn't usually watch them with me.  Subtitles and picture quality was excellent.",1522800000,,967,4.355555555555555
