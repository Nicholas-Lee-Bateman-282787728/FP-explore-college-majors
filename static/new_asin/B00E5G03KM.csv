5891183,5,B00E5G03KM,"A lot of action in this war movie, some history about the Mexican revolution. The acting was  also good . Would recommend it to anybody",1389139200,,135,4.4
5891184,5,B00E5G03KM,"Although somewhat jingoistic, it was a very well done film, almost a documentary from the Mexican point of view, taking advantage of the most modern techniques.  Well acted too.",1389052800,,177,5.103448275862069
5891185,5,B00E5G03KM,"War is hell, a young Mexican soldier learns after his first battle of Pueplo Pass.
And after his Divisions ammunition supply blows up at the garrison, killing many of his friends,
an urge ""to get away from this madness"" takes hold of him. But not for long, viewing elite French troops looting the Mexican country site, it dawns to him, that there is no way to escape hardship and tragedy, as long as his country is occupied by a foreign power, with arrogant European posture. A French Soldatesca that wants to impose a European style Monarchy on a people that fought for a republic, to be free from absolute Rulers.
The battle scenes portray the horrors of war in great detail, the final battle is one adrenalin rush after the other.
Soldiers thought to have won the battle, or decided it, all with the sudden face fresh enemy reinforcements. Because the terrain is hilly, there is little oversight for any officer overlooking the battle.
An up and down, ebbs through the struggle: attacking and retreating, feeling the taste of victory one minute, to be routed the next one. It should exhaust even the strongest warriors ...",1388275200,3,1125,4.744897959183674
5891186,4,B00E5G03KM,"Without having a big budget, this is a very good movie. The story is a bit slow, however, the actors performance transport you to that time.",1385683200,,140,4.423076923076923
5891187,4,B00E5G03KM,"For those people who do not speak fluent spanish, you will have to read the English subtitles! Both Spanish and English subtitles are available, but no English dubbing, only spoken Spanish, unlike what Amazon information says. Now, the subtitles are large enough to read easy and they are in white color. However, At times they speak Spanish real fast, so the subtitles go by fast. I kept my remote handy to reverse and or pause when needed. Other than that, the movie was done really well, a 1st class production, with exciting battle scenes and wonderfull drama to boot. In my book this is a 5 star movie, I subtracted one for no English dubbing. I understand alot of people would rather read the subtitles which is fine, I'm just not one of them. I am now loaning this movie out to the several Hispanics living close by. So, if you like battle scenes that are realistic enough that you feel you are there, all based on real people and events, don't miss this one.",1383350400,12,966,4.525714285714286
5891188,5,B00E5G03KM,Great flick.  Loved it and learned new things about my country's history that I never knew about.  Well worth the 4 bucks.,1383350400,,122,4.5
5891189,5,B00E5G03KM,"Cinco de Mayo: la Batalla it is a great movie! The actors performed very well, but what I like the most was the incorporation of some historical facts that were perhaps unknown by many people.",1382054400,10,192,4.514285714285714
5891190,5,B00E5G03KM,"Really loves this movie and more because is based in true story and true battle techniques they used that time.  I visit the place where they had the battle and there was a special show of 5 hrs about this Puebla Battle (because was exactly those day and anniversary of May 5th) it was amaizing and spectacular but more sad..
This movie is talking about the same, excellent performance and actors I REALLY RECOMENDED
But waiting for the DVD that is in Spanish and English lenguage with subtitles",1380758400,13,495,4.625

5891196,5,B00E5G03KM,I love this movie. It really gives one an idea of what Cinco is really about. It also makes me wonder what would have happened in Mexico if Zaragoza had lived to a ripe old age.,1471478400,,177,3.9444444444444446

5891201,5,B00E5G03KM,I am one of those people who hates reading subtitles.  But a barely noticed that I was reading as I was carried away by the great acting and sets.  The film brings historical figures to life in such a way that you begin to feel like one of them.  This was one of the best movies I have seen this year.  I actually watch it with my 15 year old nieces and nephews who felt the same way.,1444953600,2,384,3.8846153846153846

5891207,5,B00E5G03KM,"As a historian myself, I reviewed every single detail of this movie and I honestly say the producers did an excellent job with this movie. In 1861 after the War of Reform, France made a deal with the U.S. Confederates that they would recognize them as a government as long as they did not interfere with a french monarchy in Mexico. A year later on May 5, 1862 a French army that had been undisputed for 48 continous years since the Battle of Waterloo were defeated and humiliated by a poor mexican army. This victory gave the U.S. Union time to regroup and gain the upper hand on the Confederacy. This is a great victory for both the U.S. and Mexico as well. Viva Cinco de Mayo!!!",1435968000,2,681,4.3700787401574805

5891216,4,B00E5G03KM,"As a high school Spanish teacher I was looking for something to spice up my usual lesson about Cinco de Mayo. I happened upon this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. It has good production value, good acting, plenty of action and some good historical nuggets that make it educational (but giving the students a primer in advance is a good idea). There were times when it felt a little slow at the beginning and other times where it seemed like the battle would go on forever. It probably could have been about 35 minutes shorter. The handy-cam shakiness of some of the battle scenes was a bit overdone- it started to be hard to watch. And, there were some fairly gruesome battle shots. So, be warned. But, I give it a thumbs up if you want to see a more modern take on the battle. If you are a teacher you might want to fast forward through a few sections and/or not watch it all in one sitting. It would be a slog to try to watch it all at once.",1430956800,10,949,4.21978021978022

5891221,4,B00E5G03KM,"Love this movie, good acting awesome people good amount of historical facts a lot of people don't know what cinco de mayo really is or why we celebrate it. It's the victory of the Mexican army over the French that try to take over the city of puebla and not our independence like some people think, it a big deal because the French army was one of the best of its time and it suffer a big loss by a weaker army, of course they came back a year later and took the city and then the country therefore establishing the second mexican empire but it's all good hahaha but if you like historical movie's like me I truly recommend this movie",1422144000,,634,4.204918032786885

5891224,5,B00E5G03KM,"Graphic and realistic are two words that best describe this wonderful action/war drama film from Mexico. This first-rate production features wonderful acting, inspirational and tragic figures who all played a part in the mythical but real Battle of Puebla on may 5th, 1861. You do not have to be a Mexican to appreciate the bravery, sacrifice and passion on display in this historical battle in the history of Mexico. The director also draws the bigger picture of how the battle affected the history of the continent. The only slight complaint I had was for the shaky camera work during some the major battle. It added realism but was somewhat distracting.",1404086400,2,656,4.972727272727273
5891225,5,B00E5G03KM,The movie was great. It was historically correct for the most part. It had a little bit of eveything. It had action and even a little love story within all the chaos of war. I highly recommend it.,1403222400,,196,4.184210526315789
5891226,5,B00E5G03KM,"We often celebrate holidays without knowing the full historical background.  If more Americans and even
Mexican/Americans viewed this movie they would be surprised to know and understand the great gift the
Mexican Country People (peasants), the bravery and incredibly intelligent leadership of the small number
of the Mexican Army and President gave to our Country by winning this battle.

I never understood the significance the defeat of the French and Right Wing Conservative elitist, Mexicans.
The results of our Civil War might have had a very different outcome and Slavery may have continued because the French expected to win, then support the Confederate Army.  I bought this movie to watch again and again, because I learn more each time.  Puebla has a much stronger imprint in my memory now.",1402790400,,801,5.186046511627907
5891227,4,B00E5G03KM,Interesante. There is quite a bit of dialogue but action picks up. A lot of French in the movie too.,1402358400,,100,4.05
5891228,4,B00E5G03KM,"This is a bold attempt to tell the story of a part of Mexico's struggle for independence. After Mexico's President Juarez suspended interest payments on loans received from Europe, the European powers decided a little gun boat diplomacy was the order of the day. So an alliance between Britain, Spain and the second French Empire took off and demanded their cash. Once the parlous state of Mexico was revealed Britain and Spain got an agreement and left. The French though had other ideas and decided to join up with the conservative forces and take the country back.

Then after the scene setting most of the film is all about the Battle of Puebla where the Republic made a spirited defence and took on the modern French and gave them a good kicking on the 5th May - hence the title. The story is told through the lives of some of the players firstly Mexico's gifted General Ignacio Zaragosa (Kuno Becker - `CSI Miami') and one of his soldiers Juan and his love interest Citali. This is a no holds barred action fest. The period detail is really good but some of the battle scenes do employ the handycam shake approach - which adds to the immediacy. There is plenty of blood and the action looks and feels very authentic. There is a cast of thousands too which is great for battles no CGI armies. It is very well directed, the actors all do a great job and the story is a rip roarin ride that will have you crying `Viva Mehico!' before the end credits roll.

The down side is for history fans - this film portrays the Battle of Puebla as some sort of decisive victory where colonial France got a royal thrashing and ran away. This was actually the first in a long line of battles that lasted till 1867 some six years later. It is unashamedly patriotic and overstates the entire Mexican cause in a deliberately misleading way. However, I really enjoyed the whole two hours - it is in Spanish, French and a couple of lines in English. The sub titles are good too, if you want a history lesson then don't go near this; if you want a costume based action fest then this will tick your boxes.",1402185600,9,2088,4.449086161879896
5891229,4,B00E5G03KM,"for someone that knows the history of the battle it makes sense, I could follow what was happening, to others I think it would not, there is good follow up on these movie more in the people stories, I have one of my relatives the village story goes that they went and two return, I believe that would keep and make these a Epic movie in the future",1399852800,,347,4.117647058823529

To the people of Mexico, ""Rise up and fight for your rights.""",1482537600,2,346,4.75
8601418,2,B00E5G03KM,"Just like The Cisco Kid film (1994) version of the French intervention during the Reform Wars, it paints the French and the conservatives as greedy evil aggressors which if we read history instead of letting others educate us we would find out is false, the Mexican conservative party _invited_ the French to reinstate monarchy because Benito Juarez and his liberal party were destroying Mexico from within. Since we're preferring movies, just look at the film For Greater Glory exposing how Juarez' anticlerical laws were finally enforced by Calles. The quality of this film La Batalla is fine, but the content is off, same as the Spanish film Pan's Labyrinth which portrayed the Nationalists as purely wicked and the Communists as benevolent, which was again from reading our history simply not true, just read about the torture that was inflicted on clerics and lay Catholics by the Communists during the Spanish Civil War, horrendous. The torture scene would rather have been done by the Reds.",1480636800,,997,5.085365853658536
