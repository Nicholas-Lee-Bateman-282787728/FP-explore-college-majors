8473540,2,B005HS0B72,I would have have liked it if the format had been better. It needed to be in the building block format such as Amar Gamal's Mastering the dance. As it is there are so many combos with limited practice before moving on. It is easy to forget the earlier combos when learning the new ones if they are not linked together. I did not find this easy at all.,1454112000,,351,4.101449275362318
