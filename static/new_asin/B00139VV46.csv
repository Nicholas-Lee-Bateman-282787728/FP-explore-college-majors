8249528,4,B00139VV46,"Rodney Yee is one of my favourite instructors and this workout has remained in my workout rotation for several years now. I wouldn't call it upper body specific but it is a good overall workout. At 28 minutes I also find that it's the perfect length to fit into my day.

This is a slower moving practice, using fairly basic poses in a nice calm, even sequence. As usual Rodney Yee's (dubbed over) voice instruction is impeccable and I don't ever find myself craning my neck to see the TV. It has been shot outdoors in Maui Hawaii and the scenery is beautiful. The music is non descript new-agey stuff that I recognize from several of his other DVD's and for the most part don't even notice.

Rodney gives a brief intro, explaining the DVD and the importance of slowing down in a busy world. We then begin seated for few breaths before moving onto our backs. A folded blanket or bolster is used for a few of the poses here but it's easily modified and I've personally never bothered.

From your back you move into a Sun Salutation sequence including; Upward/Downward dogs, Child's pose, Squat, Lunges, Standing forward bends, Mountain pose, Chair and Exalted warrior.  We also do Bow pose, Camel, Eastern Plank, Cobblers, Reclined leg stretch, Bridge, and enjoy a short Savasana at the end. All in all a good complete practice although like I said not upper body specific. Namaste",1325462400,8,1379,4.662551440329218
8249529,1,B00139VV46,"This is really hard for beginners. He holds poses for extended periods so that the viewer can fully appreciate and take in the posture. But I found holding some of the poses very trying on my out-of-shape muscles. There are no modifications shown. If you can't fully do the poses, it can become very frustrating and defeating quickly. As a beginner, I won't be doing this video again.",1251158400,5,384,4.661764705882353
8249530,5,B00139VV46,"This DVD is exactly what it advertises to be--a workout for strengthening the upper body.  The Beginner using this, however, needs to be in fairly good shape for some of the moves.",1221091200,3,180,4.625
