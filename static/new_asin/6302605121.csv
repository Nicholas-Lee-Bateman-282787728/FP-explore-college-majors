487143,5,6302605121,"I'm a sucker for this movie.  I've watched it many times and never fail to enjoy the excellent visuals, the superior acting and just the general silliness of it all.  Robert Taylor is wearing much too much makeup but looks great anyway, especially in the bathtub scene!  Harlow's cough is real and is a sad reminder of her fatal disease.  The hat ""business"" with the bailiff is truly charming as is Raymond's reaction to the news that the bailiff is expecting a baby that night.  The centerpiece is, of course, the dinner party.  The superb timing by all the actors pulls off a series of sight gags (pepper in the cocktail, the over-filled wine glass, the missing dinner, the dressing).  I especially like the interaction between Raymond and his mother.  It seems so natural.  Highly recommended.",1332115200,,796,4.794117647058823
487144,3,6302605121,"Personal Property is a run of the mill 30s romantic comedy with Jean Harlow and Robert Taylor with Reginald Owen and Una O'Connor. Woody van Dyke directs this remake of a 1931 film ""The Man in Possession"" based on a 1930 play by H. M. Harwood

Jean Harlow (1911-1937) was the biggest sex symbol of her times, yet she managed to carve out a whole new persona as a comedienne (primarily as a result of her 1934 hit ""Bombshell""). Only Marilyn Monroe in the 50s ever achieved a rival position. Harlow originally specialized in playing the gangster's moll in such films as  ""The Secret Six"" (1931) and ""Public Enemy"" (1931), but in the mid 30s she began mixing sex with comedy (ala Mae West) and by the time this film was made, she was primarily a comedienne, although one could hardly dismiss her good looks.

This was her only pairing with good looking, energetic Robert Taylor (1911-69) who had achieved some success in films like ""Magnificent Obsession"" (1935) and ""Camille"" (1936). Taylor would go on to make more than 70 films, including ""A Yank at Oxford"" (1938), ""Ivanhoe"" (1952), and ""Knights of the Round Table"" (1953).

Reginald Owen (1887-1972) plays Taylor's brother. He's best known as Ebenezer Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) and made nearly 100 films including ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971). He has the distinction of having played Sherlock Holmes (""A Study in Scarlet"") as well as Dr. Watson (""Sherlock Holmes). Owen reprised his role from the 1931 version of the film.

Una O'Connor (1880-1959) plays Harlow's maid. She was a terrific actress who made nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1957. She was a true scene stealer and did so in films such as ""The Invisible Man"" (1933), ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), and ""The Adventure of Robin Hood"" (1938). She is relatively low key in this film.

FWIW - Owen and O'Connor often appeared together in films - ""Rose Marie"" (1936), ""Random Harvest"" (1942), ""Stingaree"" (1934).

Forrester Harvey (1884-1945) has a brief role as a bailiff and he is a scene stealer. Harvey played the same role in the 1931 film on which this film is based. He appeared in more than 100 films in a career between 1922 and 1946, often with Owen in films like ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) in which he played Old Fezziwig, or ""Kidnapped"" (1938) where he was the Innkeeper.

Woody van Dyke (1889-1943) directs. Best known for his ""Thin Man"" films, for which he received an Oscar nomination in 1935, he also received a nomination for ""San Francisco"" (1936) and directed Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald in 6 of their films. Van Dyke enjoyed exotic locations and made such films as ""Heart of the Yukon"" (1927), ""White Shadows in the South Seas"" (1928), ""Eskimo"" (1933), ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) and ""Cairo"" (1942). His nickname was ""one take"" because he liked to get the shot in one take, which made him invaluable to MGM from a cost POV.

1937 was a pretty meager year in films. The top grossing films were ""Snow White"", ""Saratoga"", ""One Hundred Men and a Girl"", ""Topper"", and ""Wee Willie Winkie"". The Oscars went to ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (Picture), ""The Awful Truth"" (Director), ""The Good Earth"" (Actress) and ""Captains Courageous"" (Actor). Other notable releases that year were ""Dead End"", ""The Prince and the Pauper"",  the Marx Brothers ""A Day at the Races"", and ""A Star is Born"". Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland made their first film together (""Thoroughbreds Don't Cry"") and 17 year old Lana Turner appeared in ""They Won't Forget"" and became ""the Sweater girl"". Clark Gable and Myrna Loy were voted the King and Queen of Hollywood.

This is a pretty standard late 30s romantic comedy. There is none of the screwball antics of films like ""Bombshell"" and very little sex or even implied sex, which may be a function of the London setting or the Hayes code. Nonetheless, the performances are uniformly excellent even if the film itself appears more like the play it was adapted from.",1327622400,,3955,4.827178729689808

Robert Young is adorable
The story is about family mischief,
set in London. A well to do family
is faced with renewed scandal and a shortage
of money.
I enjoyed Jean Harlow's dry wit.",1230508800,,221,4.162790697674419
487146,4,6302605121,"The first time I saw this film, I didn't think much of it, but I decided to give it another chance because I love Jean Harlow and because I hadn't paid quite enough attention to it the first time.

On the second go-round, I saw the film in a much more favorable light. The story concerns a giant flirt (Robert Taylor) whose eye lands on a beautiful woman of the upper class (Harlow). He follows her around, hoping to receive at least a smile with no avail. He waits outside the door of her home patiently while she fumes inside when a bill collector joins him on the front stoop, itching to get to the hospital to see his child born but rooted because of his job. Taylor offers to take over, a great solution for both of them. He becomes stationary at the house until Harlow can pay the bill but to her dismay since she has no money. In fact, she plans to marry another rich man because all the last one left her with a pile of debts and some large clothes. The film climaxes at a dinner party filled with rather unusual guests and Taylor as the butler.

The film is terribly fun. Taylor has a mischievous quality that is very endearing as well as a hint of romance throughout. Harlow is appropriately cold at first but softens into a wonderfully sweet woman. This movie is proof that she wasn't just a pretty face; she could act too. Taylor and Harlow work very well together and their chemistry carries the film along nicely.",1147564800,3,1427,4.340823970037453
487147,4,6302605121,"Jean Harlow and Robert Taylor made only one movie together, PERSONAL PROPERTY.  Their chemistry was palpable and moving.  In retrospect, when one considers that Harlow was then in the final stages of death from uremic poisoning at the age of 26, the joy and screwball comedy of director Woodbridge S. Van Dyke becomes somehow muted by pathos.  Many of the scenes in which Harlow parades across the stage wearing magnificent gowns showcase a woman whose character on screen is conflicted by a desire to marry a man (Reginald Owen)for his money and who, in turn, thinks the same of her.  In a film that is supposed to be the quintessence of light comedy and mistaken identity, Harlow manages to invest her character with a weariness that suggests that beneath the brassy blondness lay a heart with a conscience.  For those who are familiar with Miss Harlow's disease, it is impossible to view such scenes without some tears mingling with the humor.  And PERSONAL PROPERTY is a funny film, although not quite in the same league as its better known competition.  Still, when Harlow and Taylor share screen time, you hope against hope that they will overcome obstacles of money and identity to wind up together.  The obligatory happy ending does not seem forced at all, and suggests that the value and worth of a person's property are more of a function of the heart than of the wallet.",1071014400,19,1381,4.773109243697479
487148,3,6302605121,"As far as great movies go, this isn't really one of them.  It doesn't stand out among the great screwball comedies, or romantic love triangles featured in such films as Libeled Lady or His Girl Friday.  But Personal Property is one that any true Harlow fans should own as it was the last film she completed.  At the time of filming Harlow was already beginning to suffer from the illnesses which eventually took her life.  She shows some signs of illness and fatigue on screen.  But that almost seems to add to her character's meloncholy situation.  Personal Property brings Harlow full circle in the range of characters she played, from the unrepentent prostitutes and gold diggers of her early films to this grown up portrayal of a society widow left with nothing but a good name to recommend her.  Robert Taylor is thoroughly enjoyable as a wealthy society playboy fallen from grace.  His vivacity for life is contagious even to the casual viewer.  No wonder Harlow can't resist his charms when they're forced to shack up together for a few days.  On a side note, Harlow was engaged to actor William Powell during this period and the 130+ carat sapphire ring she sports in the film was a gift from him.  You can't miss it, it looks like she's wearing a golf ball on her hand.",1061856000,4,1278,4.610619469026549
487149,5,6302605121,"If you've never seen a Jean Harlow movie before, I highly recommend starting with this one.  As the beautiful, sophisticated widow Crystal Weatherby, Harlow shines with charm, wit, and natural comic talent.
She'll have you laughing out loud as you watch her try to marry Claude Dabney for money unaware that he's just as broke as she is and trying to marry her for her money too!  And for all my fellow Robert Taylor fans - Feast your eyes on the very young and gorgeous Raymond Dabney who falls head over heals in love with Crystal.
Hysterically funny supporting cast  and gorgeous 1930's outfits!  I totally recommend this movie so buy it now and enjoy!!!",1046995200,7,657,4.6869565217391305
487150,2,6302605121,"A so-so screwball comedy, indifferently staged and poorly directed, starring Jean Harlow in one of her last roles, and Robert Taylor in an unconvincing turn as a happy-go-lucky, bon vivant playboy, who falls under Harlow's spell... Mostly filled with ineffective  routines, though Reginald Owen steals the show as Taylor's priggish older brother, with some choice physical comedy late in the show... But otherwise this is pretty mediocre.",1030406400,,438,5.537313432835821

7828277,5,6302605121,"Zest in Quest! That is Robert Taylor's motto in this movie. It is a cute, silly, and visually beautiful farce. I love it!  As others have mentioned, it was Jean Harlow's last completed film.  She died two months after it was released. The filming was rushed because of her health and sometimes it shows. Some of the scenes needed more takes and the comic timing was off occasionally. HOWEVER, this movie is still good and very enjoyable. Over acting and extreme accents are allowed in farces. Just about everything is allowed in farces. The best scenes are when Taylor and Harlow are alone and verbally sparring. The film moves fast and leaves you wanting more from this pair who would have certainly made more films together had Harlow lived longer. Harlow and Taylor are absolutely beautiful in this film and one can understand why MGM named it PERSONAL PROPERTY!",1437004800,2,865,4.798657718120805

7828282,4,6302605121,"Teaming Robert Taylor with the near brilliant Jean Harlow results in a film that is funny but not exactly in the insanely humorous madcap comedy mode.  Directed by W.S. Vandyke who had enormous success at MGM most noticeably with William Powell and Myrna Loy and Myrna Loy and anyone, this is a story about mistaken identities. Harlow is a widow who isn't nearly as well-off financially as she pretends who believes that perception is everything. In order to snag a fabulously wealthy husband, she creates a ruse complete with a butler to attract the attention of a wealthy suitor. Her butler, played by Robert Taylor, is a playboy who is  retained retained to get the goods on Harlow. In typical madcap fashion, their odd bickering leads to romance and Harlow reveals a conscience regarding he money grubbing plot as she yields to true love.
While this movie has snappy dialogue and Harlow's delivery is still sharp and Taylor does a credible job though comedy isn't exactly his forte, there is something off in this comedy. I'm not certain if it is a less than perfect pairing of stars or if it is influenced by what I know about Harlow. This was one of her last films before her death in 1937. While she looked good, there was a tiredness to her. Her usually high powered performance seemed slower and she looked fuller. By the time she made her final film, she looked so ill that even the best make-up artists in Hollywood couldn't hide the out of control kidney disease that would claim her life at 26.
I liked this film and enjoyed Harlow's sweet performance as a shifty lady who was not quite mercenary as she seemed. However, this was not one of her better efforts and not a film she should be remembered by. This movie is good but not great.",1346371200,2,1750,4.587859424920127
