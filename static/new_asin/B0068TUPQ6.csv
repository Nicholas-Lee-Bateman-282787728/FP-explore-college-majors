4979381,5,B0068TUPQ6,"I saw the first season on PBS and found it to be a very creative and funny show filled with self deprecating humor written by the show's lead character, producer, and writer Miranda Hart. She doesn't necessarily conform to the physical standards most of us expect for a young woman but she is fun to watch as she interacts with her all too normal and attractive co-stars. I'm buying the DVD for seasons 1 and 2 because my wife and I never get tired of watching the shows very funny and unconventional story lines !",1347753600,,514,4.421052631578948
4979382,5,B0068TUPQ6,I enjoyed this season as much or more as season one.  While I found some aspects of the show to be repetitive I still thought it was entertaining.  It's laugh out loud fun and I am awaiting season three.,1346716800,,203,4.17948717948718
