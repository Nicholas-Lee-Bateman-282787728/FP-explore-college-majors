5915322,3,B00EIEPQPI,"The documentary aspect is pretty good but honestly, whoever they have singing the background vocals of Britney's best singles over the years has an insufferable tone and quality to their voice. Getting through the entire video would have been bearable if it were actual Britney vocals or instrumentals, but it's almost like the producers of this video are forcing this unknown artist's singing abilities (or lack thereof) upon you. It's pretty terrible!",1473897600,3,453,5.305555555555555

5915330,5,B00EIEPQPI,"It's not an in-depth look at the life and times of Britney Spears but it does discuss her rise from the MMC on to her various albums w/quite a bit of focus on how Britney, the person, became Britney, the product of fans.  Blackout is the most recent ""bookend"" of this story so don't expect anything from Circus, Femme Fatale or any of the more recent Collection or Remix albums.  It's a great addition to your Britney collection if you want a ""refresh"" on some of the newsworthy steps in her career--not all, just some of them.",1389484800,2,527,4.422680412371134

8605682,1,B00EIEPQPI,"Why would Amazon even have this as an option? Do they have no pride in their offerings? Patched together from paparazzi footage, why not just read a crummy tabloid magazine, you'll get a better experience. Clicked expecting something more substantial, like the Katy Perry or Lady Gaga documentaries. Was dumbfounded by this mess. Amazon, please remove from your collection.",1511481600,,373,5.338983050847458
8605683,5,B00EIEPQPI,"Interesting to watch this, now that the documentary is four years old and it is known that Britney has since gone on to enjoy her career in music.  The documentary is illuminating because it shows the enormous pressures of fame and what can happen to a celebrity when surrounded by the wrong crowd of so-called supporters.  Britney did all the usual irresponsible things young stars do when fame suddenly knocks on their doors.  She experimented with drugs and, I believe, that is the most significant factor in her decision to sever ties with her parents, her true support network.  While separated from her parents, Britney was free to be persuaded to make decisions that led to disastrous consequences.  The downward spiral she was on could very likely have led to her death.  If not for her parents' intervention, which included using the court system to reign in their daughter's self-destructive behavior, this documentary could have been the tragic story of a young star who died too soon.",1510444800,,996,4.934131736526946

8605685,1,B00EIEPQPI,"We put this on as a joke and kept it on for about 20 minutes or so. We were looking for the Bruce Willis movie and my girlfriend saw this and told me to hit play. They couldn't even secure rights to the actual music, or videos.  Everything was a bad cover song being played in the background, during soundbites of Britney being taken completely out of context.  It was laughable until it was sad.",1485216000,,396,4.266666666666667
