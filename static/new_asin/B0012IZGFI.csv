8490446,5,B0012IZGFI,"I have used the Challenger Phonics product to teach all three of our sons to read. The program is idiot proof and is so effective that you become painfully aware of the vast amounts of money and time that public schools waste teaching reading. In fact, I should have said ""failing to teach reading"" since 2/3's of 4th graders can't read at grade level, and the problem only gets worse from there on.

The full Challenger program has 3 videos, 20 pre-primers, flash cards, and an instructional video for parents, as well as written instructions. This program works brilliantly. Any normal 3 or 4 year-old will be reading in a very short time. After the child has watched the videos over and over, all a parent needs to do is spend about 15-20 minutes a night  with the child working on flash cards and pre-primers until he can read the pre-primers fluently. After that, we moved on to the 1836 edition of McGuffey's Readers (available in reprint used in any homeschool bookstore). Once a child has finished the Second Reader in that series, he can read nearly anything - and will.

The prior reviewer commented that the videos are somehow ""dated"". The only way in which the might be ""dated"" is in the fashions the women appearing in the videos are wearing. Pedagogically, the material is timeless and very effectively presented.

If you want you children to be able ot learn to read quickly while having a lot of fun, buy, beg, or borrow the Challenger Phonics program.",1233014400,4,1468,4.678294573643411
