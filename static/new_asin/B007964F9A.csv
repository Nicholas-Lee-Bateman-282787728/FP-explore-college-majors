5064122,5,B007964F9A,I  didn't realize I'd missed so much from the TV version.  I understood it so much more now.  Can't wait for the full First Season to come out.,1334880000,,143,4.035714285714286
5064123,5,B007964F9A,"I love Once Upon A Time and I love that they give us the first five episodes and bonus features with a coupon to hold us over until the official dvd release in the fall, but it was supposed to be on sale exclusively at Target for $ 9.99 and it's been sold out for a long time and it's only been out for two or three months.  I refused to pay 30.00 for the dvd and it is only the first five episodes.  So I got it on craigslist.  A few people have it on sale, but if you just put in Once Upon A Time, you get a lot of romantic ads.  This one may still have it [...]",1333324800,4,564,3.6363636363636362
5064124,5,B007964F9A,"This DVD is actually available at TARGET for only $9.99. I was glad I bought it until I saw the main menu come up saying ""ONCE UPON A TIME - SEASON 1 - DISC 1"". Which means, this is disc 1 from the upcoming full season being released this fall. If you can't wait, well worth getting. As with ""LOST"", I'm seeing things in past episodes that contain answers to future questions. Quality is excellent. The only bonus material is an audio commentary for the pilot and a taste of the soundtrack CD that'll be released later as well. Like I said, if you can't wait for the complete season coming out this fall, buy this disc. It should also come with a coupon for $5.00 off the Season One box set.",1329782400,32,691,4.242424242424242

8512579,4,B007964F9A,"I got this strictly to see Jamie Dornan and I was riveted by every brief moment that he appears. Happy that he got to keep his sexy Irish accent and beard, just wish there had been a lot more of him and that his character could be brought back. Don't miss this if you are a Jamie Dornan fanatic but don't buy this version, get the full Season 1 because he also appears in episodes 6, 7, and 22. I regret that Amazon does not provide accurate complete information as to who appears in what and if I had realized i needed episodes 6, 7, and 22, I would not have purchased this, which is not the vendor's fault.",1436227200,2,608,4.117647058823529
8512580,5,B007964F9A,"Every May, I swear I won't start any new TV shows.  And every September, Ive forgotten that and start watching several new shows.  The new show from fall of 2011 that I love is Once Upon a Time.  In this Target exclusive, you can go back to the beginning with the first five episodes.

The story opens on Emmas (Jennifer Morrison) birthday.  A bounty hunter, she has severed all ties and lives a solitary existence.  All that changes when Henry (Jared Gilmore) shows up at her door, claiming to be the son she gave up for adoption years before.  He now lives in the town ofStorybrooke,Maine.  And he claims the town is filled with fairy tale characters who don't remember who they are because they are trapped in a curse that only Emma can break.  The creator of this curse?  Snow Whites (Ginnifer Goodwin) evil step-mother (Lana Parrilla), who also happens to be Henrys adopted mom.

Emma puts no stock in Henrys claims.  But after meeting Henrys mom, she thinks something isn't right so she decides to stick around.  And things begin to happen.  Maybe Henrys theory isn't so crazy after all.

Meanwhile, we also get to take trips to the fairy tale kingdoms that were.  Even here, not everything is quite how we know it to be as the creators put their unique twists on the familiar stories, making them richer and lots of fun.

Of course, the fairy tale world is also where I have my only real gripe  special effects.  Any time they try to do anything too elaborate, it shows.  But Im having such a good time I can quickly dismiss that.

Because the story that they are telling is so good.  It pulled me in from the pilot and each of the episodes here grabbed me just as much.  Usually, I find both Storybrooke and the Fairy Tale world equally compelling.  The creators worked on Lost, and you can see it in this mix.  Hopefully, this one actually leads to an ending at some point, but thats much farther down the road than what we have on this disc.

Ive heard various people complain about the acting on the show, but I find it great.  I especially love Emma and Regina.  Their scenes just crackle with their animosity.

Obviously, if you have been watching from the beginning, you can wait until the complete first season comes out.  But if you want to go back to the beginning of Once Upon a Time right now, this is a great way to do it.

But now that it's available, skip this and get the complete first season.",1432598400,,2417,4.425
8512581,2,B007964F9A,Thought I was purchasing the Complete Season 1 - had to reorder to get the correct product.,1419811200,,91,4.411764705882353
8512582,5,B007964F9A,Love this show. I should have bought the whole season right away but live and learn. Got to be more carefull Amazon changed there rules and they block selling of some DVD movies now. Not very fair to all sellers. So if your like me buy new DVD movies and then sell them. Be carefull Amazon blocks some sellers even if your one of there best BUYERS,1370476800,,347,4.1940298507462686

8512584,2,B007964F9A,"at first I didn't even notice that it was only the first five episodes, so I was rather dissapionted with it, so I am hope to get the full season next time, to be able to enjoy all of it",1359417600,,186,3.675
8512585,5,B007964F9A,"I was so excited that today this would be released so I came to Amazon to see how my order was doing.  (I had pre-ordered this 3 weeks ago with the bargain discount of $38.99).  I was so disappointed to see the pre-ordering was worthless and they offered it now for $29.99!  If you pre-ordered, QUICK!  Check your amount and cancel the order so you can re-order it for almost $10 less! I will never pre-order from Amazon again, knowing it wasn't really a 'deal'.

Now about the show - best show I have seen in a long time.  I have never wanted to own a series until now.  Prime time AND still ok for kids to watch!?!  Count me in!",1346112000,,630,4.148760330578512
