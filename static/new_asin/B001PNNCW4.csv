3751018,5,B001PNNCW4,"This Mary Higgins Clark Collection of movies is definitely a ""must see"" for anyone who enjoys a little suspense & mystery, etc. along the way.  I love these moves, and would also  buy ""Danielle Steele"" movies if you sold them too.  Thanks and Happy Holidays!",1355443200,5,258,4.688888888888889
3751019,5,B001PNNCW4,"I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books and find them to be very entertaining.  I enjoy books that once you being to read you just can't put it down.  Mary Higgins Clark never fails to add suspense and reality to her story lines.  I must admit though, I do not enjoy Carol Higgins Clark to the extent I do with Mary Higgins Clark.  She is a good author, but not great.  She will eventually get to that point, I just don't know when.  I am also going to buy the other set of Mary Higgins Clarks stories as soon as I finish this set.  I am passing them on to my sister-in-law who enjoys Mary Higgins Clark as well.",1304294400,3,618,4.0578512396694215
3751020,4,B001PNNCW4,"I'm a fan of Mary Higgins Clark mystery stories, and it's great that her stories are made into movies.
However, I find the acting on all the movies made of her books to be inconsistent.  Some of the side characters are acted very well, while others are acted poorly.  The lead in almost every one feels to be overacting.  Accents are inconsistent (siblings of the same household with different accents, American characters with a mix of British and Canadian accents).
 Yet, if you love MHC novels and are willing to overlook the acting inconsistencies, I suggest getting this collection.  I personally really like these movies for the mystery and suspense of the stories, enough so that I'm willing to watch past what irritates me about the acting.  So, I give four stars for the stories themselves and minus the fifth star for the acting.",1293840000,27,839,4.791666666666667
3751021,4,B001PNNCW4,"I feel that 5 out of the 7 movies were outstanding. As frequently is seen, the endings of a few of these movies were somewhat 'weak'. Over-all, a very enjoyable collection.",1290988800,9,172,4.580645161290323
3751022,5,B001PNNCW4,"Here's a quick list of the movies and stars in the collection.

3751059,5,B001PNNCW4,"If you have read her books, you will love the movies based on her books. Known as ""The Queen of Suspense"", Mary Higgins Clark is a ""master plotter"" who has the ability to slowly draw out the tension whether reading one of her books or watching one of her movies  making you think everyone is guilty. Her movies feature strong, independent young women who find themselves in the midst of a problem that they must solve with their own courage and intelligence. These books/movies sometimes make you think ""that could have happened to me, or to my daughter,"" to relate to the situations. I like her books/movies because she chooses not to include explicit sex or violence in her stories.",1398124800,8,684,4.7

3751063,5,B001PNNCW4,"At times I enjoy escaping my academic researches into the realm of mystery and Mary Higgins Clark's books into movies are quite enjoyable.  The movies are well directed, the acting well done and the location settings are often quite beautiful.  I recommend it to all out for an enjoyable evening with dinner and a companion to enjoy it with.",1369612800,3,341,4.762711864406779
3751064,5,B001PNNCW4,"I love all her movies, I am so glad that she has aloud her work into such entertaining movies.  It is nice to see a romance movie or a murder mystery that isn't filled with a lot of skin, or way too much blood.  We know what both look like so leave most of it out,  I love the actors and actoresses as well./",1366156800,2,308,3.78125

8333921,4,B001PNNCW4,"I've been trying to catch all the Mary Higgins Clark movies available, with mixed results.  Some of them are laughably bad/cheesy, others are pretty good.  Bought this set without great expectations, have watched two of the three so far, and have been agreeably surprised!  In French with English subtitles, which doesn't bother me at all.  And I feel the caliber of the productions exceeds most of those I have seen, including the acting.  So if you're a fan, don't let the subtitles dissuade you, give it a chance. ( It's been awhile since I've read the books, can't recall if there are changes to the plots.)",1483315200,,611,4.726415094339623
