What does it mean to love, anyway?

For the answers, watch this movie. See which characters live in a fantasy land of their own devising, and which have a clear grasp of reality. And watch them be transformed.

As many here have mentioned, this is a wonderful story with a talented cast that has been sadly overlooked.  Watch it, and see if you agree.",1457827200,,648,4.2439024390243905
876752,5,6304438176,This is a very under appreciated movie.  I never heard of it before yet it features stellar performances by some really top tier actors.,1456790400,,136,4.666666666666667
876753,3,6304438176,"This strongly-cast movie version of the late Scott McPherson's play is notable for a fine early performance by the young Leonardo DiCaprio, just shortly after his strong performance in ""This Boy's Life"" in the mid-1990's.  To put it that way is perhaps a little unfair to the other actors -- Diane Keaton, Meryl Streep, Robert DeNiro, and Gwen Verdon, who work hard and honorably with material that is finally less interesting -- because not very compellingly written.  Part of the trouble is that the conception of the character of Bessie (Diane Keaton), the selfless sister who has devoted 17 years of her life to taking care of her father, post-stroke (Hume Cronyn), and also looking out for her aunt (Gwen Verdon) who has chronic pain problems and goes around therefore in a cheerful medicated haze.  McPherson wrings some humor from a dire situation that is a little cringe-making, but the point is, I suppose, to demonstrate a kind of ""steel magnolia"" resilience.  Bessie is simply too good to be true -- even in her blow-up with her sister Lee (Streep) for deserting her in a time of need 17 years earlier she can hardly make anger credible.  When Bessie is diagnosed with leukemia, however, things get serious.  Her sister and her sister's children drive down from Ohio to have their bone-marrow checked for a transplant match, so the the scene is set for recrimination and reconciliation.  This is where Lee's son Hank (DiCaprio) complicates things -- alienated from his mother, who doesn't know how to relate to him and who is trying to become a professionally certified cosmetologist, and idealizing a father he hardly remembers, Hank burns down his mother's house, is placed in an mental institution, and it's from there that he makes the trip to Bessie's Florida home.  Bessie treats him as an adult, he responds to her in a way that he doesn't to his mother, and awakens jealousy in Lee, who just can't stop herself from from being bossy and condescending to him.

All that suggests that in this movie Lee has the meatier part, and Streep suggests through gesture and expression more than through words that she feels guilty about the appalling situation that she left Bessie in all these years before.  She can't bring herself to bluntly acknowledge it, but her behavior as the play goes on manifests that recognition, and Bessie, almost perfect as she is, takes the deeds for the statement and a reconciliation is effected.  As Hank, DiCaprio, again through gesture and expression more than words, creates a vivid, fresh image of a troubled 17-year-old.  He has an expressive mobility of feature unusual in a young actor, and he's very effective.  Robert DeNiro  has a cameo as Bessie's doctor -- a man who seems kindly yet uncomfortable with people.  His brother Bob (Dan Hedaya) serves as his receptionist -- a comic role that could have been done without -- no disrespect to Dan Hedaya, a fine actor when he gets a decent part.  Gwen Verdon as Aunt Ruth is almost as badly treated.

The movie avoids one kind of sentimental ending -- thus establishing McPherson's ""realist"" credentials, I suppose -- by pressing home another.  Laughter and tears, we're meant to think -- isn't life just like that!",1453334400,,3216,4.858974358974359
876826,5,6304438176,"I can't believe I missed this over the years. So many of my favorite actors, especially Meryl Streep who was outstanding. It's a touching story, a character study and very moving in a subtle way. Everyone did a wonderful job, even Hume Cronyn who never spoke a word, spoke volumes in his expressions.
If you are looking for a quiet story, not full of action but a story of love and hurt and acceptance, this is it.
I agree with a past review that stated ""Any movie with Meryl Streep is an occasion, but when you add Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hume Cronyn and Gwen Verdon, you've got an embarrassment of riches.""

876956,2,6304438176,"The script and directing were abysmal.  Bad cuts abound.  Messed up takes are left in ""for effect"" which doesn't work.  The ""humor"" is strained.  Leonardo DiCaprio is the one shining star.  His performance is always real and believable.  You stop thinking of him as an actor and only as the character he portrays.  Robert Di Niro should shoot his manager / agent for getting him involved in a role like this that doesn't suit him at all.  I have heard through sources that the main actors were supremely unhappy at which takes were chosen during the editing process by the director.  He was trying to ""play"" with the film making process itself and it just lays a big fat egg.",1390435200,,675,4.558333333333334

876959,5,6304438176,"It appears that most of the previous reviews are battling over who gave the best performance in this wonderful film. The truthful and most accurate answer is....the entire cast.
Diane and Meryl are superb, but so are Leo, Hume and the unjustly over-looked Hal Scardino, who plays the youngest brother Charlie. (Scardino's screen time is limited, but his ""potato chip"" scene alone earns him equal ranking with the rest of the players)
So here we have 5 actors in the key roles, giving 100% and firing on all cylinders, and they play off each other with spectacular precision. You become convinced that this is a very real family dealing with very real problems.
Director Jerry Zaks earns high praise for his impressive framing, especially during the emotional scenes, and for his perfect pacing, which is crucial in this type of film.
The actual story that's presented is very realistic and emotional, but thankfully is never overly sentimental or melodramatic.
So, in a nutshell, this film is one of those quiet, slice-of-life dramas that blows in like a cool summer breeze, never resorting to vulgarities or bombast. For those of us who enjoy these types of films, ""Marvin's Room"" is a welcomed addition, and one that we highly recommend to others.",1377993600,,1249,4.9523809523809526
876960,4,6304438176,"Who can resist a film with Diane Keaton, Meryl Streep, Robert DeNiro and Leonardo DiCaprio? Plus Hume Cronyn and Gwen Verdon.

Not me. Frankly I found the characters and the story a little predictable and the characters a little stereotypical.  There's the ""bad"" sister,(Streep) selfish, sexy, the one who wears a lot of makeup and smokes, has two kids and no husband, who's training to be a cosmetologist.  Her opposite, the ""good one"" (Keaton) who stayed home to take care of the ailing father and ditzy aunt, plain, wears no makeup, hasn't had a date in 20 years.  And the angry teenaged son who burned the house down and the good son who wears thick glasses and has his nose constantly in a book.

What saves this from being sappy is the brilliant cast.  Who but Diane Keaton could imbue her character with love in such a genuine way that you have to believe this is possible?  Streep is always good and disappears into her character so well that I forgot this is the woman I just saw as Clara in House of the Spirits the night before.  DeNiro and DiCaprio both do good jobs and look great.

There are some lovely scenes.  I liked the mom's interview with the psychiatrist who keeps repeating everything the mom says.  My favorite was the wild drive DiCaprio and Keaton took along the beach, with both of them screaming for joy.

Frankly I think the film is a little dated. And I guess I've seen enough films where the good heroine comes down with an incurable disease.  But it's still worth seeing if only for Keaton's statement that she's been so lucky to have so much love in her life...not on the receiving end but that she had people to love.",1375228800,,1651,4.5

Essentially it is about death and illness being an integral and inescapable part of life, and what love can achieve for us when we approach tragedy and loss with love.  Meryl Streep is a marvel at the unloving sister who has chosen selfishness rather than love; and Leonardo de Caprio gives his usual top quality performance as a child who has learned to trust no one.  Diane Keaton, for my money, does the heavy lifting as the one who knows how to love, but is fully human at the same time, vulnerable to fear, vulnerable to panic, vulnerable to emotional and physical exhaustion.  ---- The humor in the film works wonderfully, and I wonder if the film wouldn't have been unbearable without the humor, because it so accurately depicts the horrific burdens life can put upon us, and the crippling effects that illness can have on anyone of us at any time.  Ultimately the film uplifts, reassures and essentially shows the wisdom of love and that altruism isn't just a virtue that some enjoy when they can afford to enjoy it, but rather a very valuable coping mechanism for everyone.  Life is better, this film says, for those who know how to love, and for that reason it is a practical virtue as well as a beautiful one.  The film looks beautiful, the camera never being cynical about the small house in which the drama takes place, but revealing instead the coziness of the dwelling and the vibrant personalities in it.

One of the best and well-acted movies, I ever seen from a small-yet A-list cast to date.  Marvin's Room is about two estranged sisters who live in separate states after their father was struck with a sudden stroke.

Lee (Meryl Streep), runs away from her homelife in Florida to start a new one in Ohio.  She manages to have -- two children, Hank (Leo DiCaprio) and Charlie (to me who bares a strong resemblance to those Harry Potter book covers) -- also shes on the verge to obtaining her comestology degree.

Bessie (played by Diane Keaton & also recieved an Oscar nom for this performance) still lives in Florida to take care of both of her ill father and soap opera addicted Aunt Ruth.  On a scheduled doctor's appointment, Dr. Wally (Robert De Niro) orders in blood work for Bessie -- she thinks it's just a vitamin deficiency -- however by her next visit she discovers she has leukemia, a cancer that took her and Lee's mother.

Meanwhile, Hank lands himself in the asylum after burning Lee's house down from  anger and old wounds (this will be explained in the movie to why, maybe he done it).

While making a temporary home at a nun's convent, Lee gets a phone call from Bessie telling her she has cancer and needs a bone marrow.  Lee gathers up herself and the boys to be by her family she hasn't seen in 20 years.  Lee and Hank's mother-son relationship is put to the test while they both deal with their own stubborn and selfish attitudes towards Bessie's illness.  While this is happening, Hank and Bessie develop  an unsuspected bond that somewhat makes Lee a tad jealous.

Questions: Will this family manage to get through this or will old wounds take their tole?  Will these two sisters happen to patch up their 20 year separation?  Will Bessie get her bone marrow match?  Will there be any 'happy ending'?

All I have to say is: WATCH!  It is the best hour and fourty minutes that will have you and whoever you watch this with.  Keep the tissues handy!",1322006400,,1992,4.542134831460674

877190,4,6304438176,"This film is over a decade old and is a gem overall.  It deals with what has become all too common these days, care of our elderly (and sometimes relatives, and parents) and how such situations can often tear surviving family members and families, even extended ones, apart.  While it does not deal with ""wealth"" as it often concerns better senior citizen medical and ""nursing"" home conditions and treatment, or how the whole corrupt medical ""industry"" in general mistreats the most innocent among us (only they're ""old""), or any overt political/social issues, it indeed succeeds in showing the human (and ""family"") costs of its general subject.  Especially in estranged and squabbling potential and actual ""caretakers.""

Meryl Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio, Diane Keaton, Robert DeNiro and Hume Cronyn lead a truly stellar cast in telling the sad, sometimes darkly at othertimes lighthearted humorous, and dramatic tale of a few individuals in a family who are trying to decide the best interests and care of their aging and bed-ridden, demented and childlike, elder.

Diane Keaton has been the caretaker for years of Hume Cronyn, her father.  And that of Meryl Streep as well, though the latter has been out of touch for years, and has two kids, and long ago made the decision to concentrate on her own life rather than give needed aid to her sister.  Meryl has two kids, one a troublesome teenager in Leonardo.  Diane is dying of cancer, struggling to offer personal home health care to her dying father, with a limited income, and only another aging, half-crazed ""aunt"" to help her.  When Keaton's character is diagnosed by DeNiro (who is sort of wasted here), she contacts Streep to come down to Florida and ""visit.""

What follows is a real trip, and the introductory scenes of exposition are very well done.  When Keaton and Streep finally meet up, so much comes from them, and they interact in extremely stressful and at times, combative ways.  Leonardo's character is fully realized and he makes not only an amazing transformation from beginning to end, but in a way, is the catalyst for a reconcilliation between the feuding sisters.

Filled with genuine pathos and ironic and subtle humor, and great performances by all, ""Marvin's Room"" will touch anyone (like me) who has ever dealt with the emotional storms behind family conflicts in dealing with just how to deal with our elders, and how it all interacts (and sometimes selfishingly interferes) with individual lives, lifestyles, and ""survivor"" plans for the near and far future.  Even if you have not been involved in similar situations however, there is enough generally good stuff here to dent even the most hardened soul.

Despite the star power, direction is linear and creative, production values and sets while obviously not budget-heavy, do a great job, and in the end, these enhance what could have been a more ""downer"" film than it might've been.  There are many enchanting and challenging sequences scattered throughout which make this a movie worth repeated viewings, if for no other reason, to catch so many subtle and effective nuances.  And there are many scenes and lines and interactions to keep it all moving at a good and entertaining manner.

While this could've easily been a ""Lifetime"" or other low budget, non-theatrical release, the celebrity actor heavy track, never interferes with what is one of the few Hollywood films to deal with this general subject at all, and remains ten years later, one of the best to do so.  With ""death"" all around, all the characters are right out of many, many real life stories of a lot of us, but eventually, despite all of it, the movie has a life affirming, positive message in the end.

While I wished the movie's beginnings were trimmed and the endings expanded and elaborated on, this film is overall a winner, and except for minor detours and missteps along the way, should satisfy anyone with a basically decent heart and a recognition of simply ""doing the right thing"" when it comes to family and elder-care issues and individual concerns, needs, and wants.  Lastly, a big thumbs up for the subtle but excellent use of music here, with special note of the truly wonderful Carly Simon song ""Two Little Sisters,"" which plays over the end credits.",1183248000,,4270,4.935754189944134

877194,4,6304438176,"How families fall apart and mend themselves is the point of this star-laden 1996 movie, but stage and TV director Jerry Zaks, screenwriter Scott McPherson, and a trio of fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with something more resonant. Based on a play by McPherson before he succumbed to AIDS, the semi-autobiographical plot focuses on two estranged, middle-aged sisters. In Florida, mousey spinster Bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father Marvin and their eccentric aunt Ruth. In Ohio, Lee escaped family responsibility to get married and raise two sons in Ohio only to see things fall apart. Lee is on the verge of turning her life around as a licensed cosmetologist when Bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and reaches out to Lee and her sons as potential bone-marrow transplant candidates.

The rest of the movie is mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable. Intriguingly, while the soap opera elements are strictly by-the-numbers, there is a persistent undercurrent of black comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of the piece. It also helps that Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton play the sisters. As the embittered, guilt-ridden Lee, Streep moves easily back into blue-collar, Silkwood territory, and she unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her self-centered character. However, it's a vanity-free Keaton who really radiates as Bessie finding inner strength and contentment under increasingly dire circumstances. A year before ""Titanic"", Leonardo di Caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile hellions as Lee's oldest son Hank, a textbook example of teenaged, pyromaniac angst.

The rest of the cast is fine in limited turns - Robert DeNiro (one of the producers as well) as the bumbling Dr. Wally; Dan Hedaya as his even more pixilated brother Bob; Gwen Verdon as wild-eyed, soap opera-obsessed Aunt Ruth; Hal Scardino as Hank's self-controlled little brother Charlie; and Hume Cronyn, who is forced to play Marvin with severely limited expression. There are predictable moments throughout, but some surprise and a few actually enthrall, including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when Bessie recalls the drowning death of her open-mouthed carny boyfriend. There are no extras with the 1999 DVD release.",1164240000,,2381,5.346666666666667

877227,4,6304438176,"As long as any family is in turmoil over interpersonal relationships, this sparkling gem of a film has a message for the heart. When single mom Lee (Meryl Streep) gets a call from long-estranged sister Bessie (Diane Keaton) that the latter has been diagnosed with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant match, off goes Streep with her two sons, the older an arsonist juvenile delinquent (Leonard DiCaprio in an understated strong performance). Living with Bessie in her Florida home is her and Lee's slowly deteriotating father, Marvin (the late Hume Cronyn), neither of whom Lee has seen in nearly two decades. Coming together as sisters, one of whom is likely to die, Streep must come to emotional resolution of her decision to leave and consign Bessie to their ailing father, while Bessie has to confront the years of sacrificing love and her own life to tend to her father. Together, Streep and Keaton are bravado in coming to an uneasy truce - and, later, we are led to hope, love - while seeing but not yet ready to come to terms with each other about their feelings for their choices made years earlier. But when they do, the resolution is a refreshingly honest one that, when all is nearly said and done, the past is done and all the two really have is each other. A subplot is DiCaprio's portrayal of Bessie's nephew who develops what looks to be a stronger relationship with his aunt than with his mother, an observation not lost with some regret on Streep's maternal character. Director Jerry Zaks has a gem in this 1996 production that earned Keaton her third Best Actress nomination in that it isn't smaltzy in sentimentality and instead paints a portrait of a broken family coming to a fragile peace. In a cameo, Robert DeNiro breathes some unusual comedic breath into his character as Bessie's doctor who seems forever frazzled by his office assistant who happens to be his mentally impaired brother. The film's ending gives us an unstated look at where Bessie's physical battle is likely to take her, and Streep's resolution to it gives us a hope that those of us who harbor feelings of anger and regret can, when the time comes, surmount them. Keaton, Streep and DiCaprio together combine to give a moving but honest look at the tragedies that face all families and how those tragedies can sometimes churn out the miracle of redemption.",1121126400,,2358,4.767726161369193

877229,5,6304438176,"One of the best dramas of the 90's. I've seen this movie a number of times since its release and it never fails to move me. It is a story of two estranged sisters whose life choices drove them to different paths but after years of no contact brought them together again when one needs a bone marrow transplant due to cancer. That's when they had the chance to talk about unsaid feelings and provide them a closure. Diane Keaton played the sister with the cancer and Streep the sister who'll try to give the transplant. Leonardo di Caprio (underrated actor) plays Streeps rebellious son and De Niro has a semi cameo as Keaton's doctor. The titular Marvin is the father of Streep and Keaton whose been dying for years without actually dying.

Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton were perfection. I especially enjoyed Streep's performance. It was fun seeing her play a bitch and she nailed the role. But Diane Keaton ultimately takes over the movie especially in the end. I was deeply moved by her performance, so natural and true that it stays with me long after the movie ends.

There's a moving scene towards the end of the movie, when out of the blue Keaton said to Streep that she's very lucky because her life was full of love and then Streep consoled her and said yes many people loves her. But Keaton said it's not about that. What she meant was she's very lucky to love her dad and her aunt so much. Makes you realize that the best feeling in the world is to love someone regardless whether reciprocated or not. The ending was just perfect, it's still sad but in a good way where the characters reached the peak of their character arcs. It's a triumphant ending.

I recommend this film to the highest regard possible. It's full of heart and I don't want to say life lessons because the movie ain't preachy, but I guess in some ways made you think about your own life.

877232,4,6304438176,"Instead of the usual over-the-top heavy-sentiment scenes in a dysfunctional family, Marvin's Room finds a clever, non-contrived way to end by leaving its characters at a magical moment of mutual understanding. It is one of the most powerful endings I've ever seen in a film.
Greatly acted by almost everyone (including a very young Leonardo Di Caprio), great score, excellent screenplay, a tinge of wry humor through it all, and gutwrenching emotion.
I picked up the DVD for Streep, and found her character a little one-dimensional. But when I really think of it, the most remarkable thing about the film is how it reveals how similar the two sisters are, despite their non-trivial character differences. Both abandon one part of their family to sacrifice for another part -- they each merely take different parts, and that's why Lee's character is not as bad, selfish or one-dimensional as she first seems. Lee's problem was understanding love. Despite all her lovers, Lee (Streep) had to learn the real meaning of love from her spinster sister Bessie (Keaton).
Worth buying, as anyone with a heartbeat will watch this gem more than once. Highly recommended.",1080864000,,1159,5.0732984293193715

This movie is one of the most unique that I have ever seen. It is handled in a way that is touching and real; the heart in this movie is truly genuine. Leonardo DiCaprio is a wonderful actor who creates another brilliant portrayal of yet another troubled youth in ""Marvin's Room"" but the credit in this movie really belongs to the sisters, played by Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. I have been a long-time fan of both actresses, but this movie is truly the starring moment for both of them.
The beauty of ""Marvin's Room"" is in it's simplicity. There is nothing forced about this movie, and it seems to flow directly to the heart from the heart. Whether or not you are a fan of the stars of this movie, I have no doubt that you will be able to enjoy this film for what it is and for the heart and the feeling that have been put into it.",1065312000,,935,4.171270718232044

It proves the importance of family because one never knows when a loved one is needed.  Diane Keaton's Oscar nominated performance as a leukemia patient creates the movie's foundation.  Her quest for a bone marrow transplant creates many twists and turns throughout the whole movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as a rebellious teenager inflicts most of them to the audience.  Everyone knows Meryl Streep performs only at her best.  ""Marvin's Room"" is no exception.  The cast and crew's help in creating this wonderful movie leads the audience to a surprising conclusion that one is forced to think about the outcome.  There's a reason the writers did this, and the viewer must think about why.  Hint: it may reflect real life.",1060819200,,904,4.966666666666667
877273,5,6304438176,"""Marvin's Room"" is not only a wonderful movie that has both comedy and drama, but it has an excellent cast.  I was very surprised that it wasn't nominated for Best Picture at the Oscar's.  Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep shine as two sisters who have not seen each other in twenty years.  Their bond is very easy to relate to.  And then you have Leonardo DiCaprio (beofre ""Titanic"").  He is wonderful as Hank, the older son of Lee (Streep).  You can tell that he wants attention, mainly from his mother who has her sights set on other things.  Bessie (Keaton), in a very moving and loving way shows Hank that he is loved, by his mother and by herself.  I thought that the car-ride by the water was wonderful.  It showed the two of them bonding, which is what they do more and more as the film progresses.
Gwen Verdon is wonderful as the absent-minded Aunt Ruth who really brings a lot of comedy into the movie.  Hume Cronin was simply wonderful, even though he didn't have any actual speaking lines, his actions throughout the movie seem to bring the disfunctional family together.  Robert DiNero plays the very kind Dr. Wally who also brings a sweetness into the film.  But the person who, in my opnion, really shines in this film is Diane Keaton.  She has a rare talent and it definitely shows in this movie.  The ending was so wonderful as well.  I am glad that they ended on a positive note instead of a sad one.  My advice: Rent this movie!!!!!",1059436800,,1447,4.444866920152092
877274,4,6304438176,"Dying, aging and dysfunctional famlies are subjects that do not prompt much laughter, but ""Marvin's Room"" a film, based on the stage play of the same title, manages to mine together those issues along with discussion of sibling rivarly, love and friendship, and the end result is a lovely film, low on schmaltz and sacharine, and high on intelligence and class.
Streep and Keaton play sisters who have been alienated for much of their adult lives, and are reunited when Keaton's Bess is in need of a bone-marrow donation. Streep's Lee comes with her children, and is also reunited with her father, Marvin (a stunning Hume Cronyn), and dotty aunt (a glittering Gwen Verdon). Leonardo DiCaprio (pre-TITANIC) plays Lee's rebellious surly teenaged son. DiCaprio one of Hollywood's brightest, but most unused talents gives a performance of vulnerability, passion and beauty that one can't help but make favorable comparisons to James Dean or Montgomery Clift. Streep is predictably good-though she doesn't seem to connect to her character, as well as her co-stars do. Keaton does the near-impossible in this film-she steals it from Streep. Her Bess is not saint, but Keaton manages to glow, regardless. Actually both DiCaprio and Keaton outshine Streep. Their chemistry is beautiful. Keaton's appearence is stunning because, while attractive, she allows herself to be transformed into a dowdy Florida hausfrau. Ravaged by illness, age and weary, Keaton looks as if Annie Hall went through a hell of a mid-life crisis. Yet, by the end, when the genuine goodness of Bess shines through, and the viewers realize that Bess feels lucky that she was able to take care of her bed-ridden father, Keaton becomes beautiful.
Robert DeNiro has an amusing bit part as a forgetful doctor in one of the film's many amusing comic reliefs.",1057708800,,1817,5.121212121212121
877275,4,6304438176,"What's so unusual about this film and what raises it far above similar films, are two things - firstly the balance of humour and pathos and secondly the incredible acting from all of the cast. Diane Keaton was rightfully Oscar nominated but Meryl does it again in an amazing, multi-layered performance as Lee, the troubled, seemingly aloof daughter, sister and mother. She was particulary good in the scene where she sees Marvin, her father, for the first time in years and we can see the shame she feels, which is almost tangible. Certain other actresses would not have been as understated, and therefore realistic, as Streep is in this scene, and it's this subtlety that still marks her as one of the best, if not the best, film actors working today.",1055462400,,752,4.748091603053435
877276,5,6304438176,"I have watched this movie at least three times and everytime, it doesn't fail to move me. It's a rather underrated movie except for the Oscar nomination for Diane Keaton who shines supremely as a luekemia-striken woman caring for a vegeatated father and an absentminded aunt whose on a pacemaker.

Diane's only hope is a match in her sister Meryl Streep and her sons. But Streep is a woman who's faced with a broken marriage, a rebellious elder son and worst of all, an estranged relationship with her family.

When tragedy strikes and she is being called home, she learns to re-assess her life pirorities as well as learn new things about her sister (and family) that she's never known before. Through all these, an amazing bond takes place between her elder son, Leonardo Di Caprio and his aunt, Diane Keaton. An unforgettable scene was when DiCaprio's character took his aunt on a wild car-ride in the sea that sealed their bond.

The story of initial despondence and eventual hope and reconciliation is nothing new but what works here is the amazing acting (especially by Diane Keaton and the funny doctor played by Robert De Niro who also produced the movie), and poignant direction.

877277,5,6304438176,Marvin's Room is an emotional roller coaster. One minute crying and the next laughing out loud and then wondering how you can laugh about such a traumatic event.

877278,4,6304438176,"Occasionally, I like to create my own at home ""double features."" My most recent was ""Streep Weep Night"" with MARVIN'S ROOM and ONE TRUE THING on the bill.  It was heavy going at times, but I survived.  Conclusions:  Meryl is a fine fine actress; and she desperately needs to do something totally crazy and out of character soon.  Meryl, sweetie, have your agent call the Coens--or the even Farellys for that matter.
Actually, MARVIN'S ROOM IS a little bit on the quirky, black humored side.  But ultimately, it's still a melodrama about two estranged sisters (Streep's Lee and Diane Keaton's Bessie) who reunite in a time of crisis.  That's a plot outline we've all seen a couple of hundred times before. Where MARVIN differs a bit is in the wacky humor and the slightly off-kilter perspective it brings to the classic dysfunctional family drama.  Ultimately, that's the film's saving grace.  As others have noted, it may not be ""wildly funny"" but it does have enough humor to leaven the dramatic bread.
And it has Diane Keaton who is a past master at mixing the sublime and the ridiculous.  I understand that the ever generous Meryl Streep actively promoted Keaton's Best Actress Oscar nomination in '96, saying that she felt that it was Keaton who carried the movie.  Actually, they're both wonderful.  And Gwen Verdon, Robert DeNiro and, yes, Leo himself are all in fine form here.  Only poor Hume Cronyn doesn't have much to do in the title role (I mean Marvin--not the room).
It's not a great movie, but it is an feast acting-wise, and for that I'm grateful.  But it's just quirky enough to make one wonder why Streep doesn't do something really offbeat for a change. (Were SHE-DEVIL and DEATH BECOMES HER such negative experiences?)  She should at least consider working with Woody again.",1012521600,,1794,4.801302931596092
877279,3,6304438176,"This movie is based on Scott McPherson's off - Broadway play. It has been turned into a wonderful little movie. A movie that is sort of one of those lost gems. Meryl Streep heads an impeccable all star cast as a woman who comes back in contact with her long estranged sister, played by Diane Keaton. Keaton's character has been taking care of her and Streep's very old and very ill father(played so realistically by Hume Cronyn). Keaton's character then finds out that she has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. The only donors that can help are Meryl and her wayward kids(headed by the solid Leonardo DiCaprio). Meryl and the kids head down to Florida where Keaton is and, well, they bring along some of their own little dysfunction. The movie is sad, but not in the ball your eyes out way. It avoids the usual scenes of death beds and a huge dying scene. None of that is here. The movie is about the family, and the two estranged sisters coming together. Not to mention Meryl's character coming to terms with her son Hank(Leo). The film definitley hits some emotional highs, but it's not, as I've said above, the usual way we've seen it a hundred times before. Robert De Niro appears in a fairly small role as Keaton's character. He also co-produced the film. Our main stars here all shine brightly. Keaton is great, as always. Meryl and Leo makes their characters believeable, if not very sympathetic. In the end, it's Keaton who shines the brightest. Marvin's Room is a nice family drama that was horribly overlooked and forgotten by most people. Give it a chance.",1012176000,,1578,4.639285714285714

On the cover of the movie reads, ""Wonderfully Funny!"" -- Gannett News Service.  I don't get it.  Funny?  Wonderfully funny? There's sickness and bitterness and anger and love in this fine movie, but not once did I laugh.  Sorry, too serious of issues for me to laugh my head off.

877281,5,6304438176,"Most of the reviews of 'Marvin's Room' I've read online all mention Leonardo DiCaprio and how cute he is, how much he is loved, and how he acted wonderfully in the movie. I can't say I don't agree- he adds flavor to the movie and pulls off a very convincing act of a troubled boy. But the floor belong to Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. I can't think of better actresses for this movie than these two- they're beautiful together. The movie is handled in a dramatic light; from the beach scene to the darkened scene where Bessie tells the story of her dead boyfriend. I don't think there's a better movie of family dysfunction. Most movies on family dysfunction end badly and disappoint me greatly. But this movie is a positive one, and ends in one of the best scenes I've ever seen. Here you have two sisters who haven't seen each other in like twenty years, and suddenly they reunite because Bessie needs a bone marrow transplant; otherwise she'll die. From that, they embrace each other hesitantly but surely; they realize of their love for eachother. They all depend on each other and grow from each other. Lee is someone with lost hope; and Bessie is the one who restores it. You can almost see Bessie's rare spirit reaching out and touching everyone around her. My favorite scene is when Lee convinces Bessie to take off her wig so she can cut it. Of course, anyone's got to feel embarassed if their wigs have to come off in front of anyone; let alone someone you haven't seen for 20 years. But Bessie takes it off with courage and hope; you can totally see it.  Keaton was completely magical in this one; she has rare talent. Bessie was the only one emitting hope and triumph in the face of death; and everyone around her began to feel it also. This person is someone I could never be. I admire this character. The final scene... whoo! The rays of light bouncing off the walls seem to be a representation of heaven and love. They all knew Bessie was going to die. This scene is handled with such finality. I would have much preferred the movie end this way than seeing Bessie die. This family is dysfunctional, but this family also experienced love and courage. To be completely honest, I was stunned into dead silence for the first ten minutes after the movie ended. Then I rewound the movie and started watching it again. I couldn't get enough of this exquisite movie. It's much more than a movie- it's pure reality and imagination combined. This movie is proof that people like Bessie exist. Keaton definitely deserves the Academy Award nomination. Hell, she should have won it! I love her. I love this movie! Go see it immediately! You won't regret it--trust me.",979689600,,2671,4.553014553014553
877282,5,6304438176,"Of course, the LEO lovers are going to hate this . . . but, not even his pretty face and character-style acting could harm this movie.  I think only a handful of guys have reviewed this film, which means a majority of the reviewers are affected primarily by Leo DiCaprio's good looks.  I have seen a few of his movies, and they all portray rebels; this is probably because that is what he is (essentially he plays himself).  Nevertheless, Dicaprio excels at that persona.  The audience becoming emotionally carried away with a leading actor is what studios gamble on, and some gamble that the movie itself is a work of art.  So, what makes MARVIN'S ROOM delightful is its simplicity in defining love. This movie is made up of the most ordinary things: family dysfunction, disease, bitterness, frustration, disappointment, fear, the family next door.  Keaton's realization/declaration of her life's blessing is superb cinema, because this is what I feel creates the most fulfilling life experience: not being loved but loving.  And boy does she love those around her with the strongest commitment.  The apt title MARVIN'S ROOM is eloquent in that it defines Keaton's dedication by her tireless display of refracted light all over the walls for Marvin's profound amusement, which is reward enough to Keaton.  She effectively turned what would be a prison to the average person into a family room.  Also, I believe her greatest fear of death lies in worrying ""What will happen to Marvin?"" Thankfully, Streep is drawn, at first against her will, into the peace, love and fulfillment of Marvin's Room from her whirlpool of ambition (it's Keaton's incredible effect/change on DiCaprio's character that is the catalyst). Streep is just getting her degree and hopes for big time freelance work! But, she actually allows both ambition and fear to take second place as she falls into a role of responsibility.  Carly Simon's end-title song ""Two Little Sisters"" is the cinematographic element that pulls everything together into an excellent film.  All that may sound mushy, but the song is like a poem and, thus, becomes part of the dialogue.  I think this song combined with the last scenes provoke wistfullness.  One sister dreamed of going to the other side of town; the other to the stars.  However, in the cold night when lights go dim and dreams seem old, each would come home to the other.  This summarizes all that is good about this movie.  Now, LEO lovers, it is possible for a movie with him in it to be good based on filmmaking and not pretty hair.",973987200,,2550,4.8657407407407405
877323,5,6304438176,"Initially performed off Broadway in 1991, ""Marvin's Room"" was written by a man by the name of Scott McPherson. At the time, he, his lover, and a number of their friends were suffering from the effects of  AIDS. ""We all take care of each other,"" McPherson wrote in the  play's program, ""the less sick caring for the most sick. But at times,  an unbelievably harsh fate can be transcended by a simple act of  love."" ""Marvin's Room,"" is about just this. By no means is  it a story about cancer or terminal illness. Instead, it leaves all  television ""disease of the week"" cliches at the door, and stands  as a gut wrenching testament to the healing power of love. Eloquently  brought to screen in this handsome production, ""Marvin's Room""  loses none of its beauty in its transition to film. The performances are  excellent across the board with Meryl Streep, and Diane Keaton shining in  their roles, and Gwen Verdon and Leonardo DiCaprio giving equally fine  work. Veteran stage director Jerry Zaks does an excellent job with his  material as the picture is filled with several moving images and moments.  It is hard to forget the scene in which Lee is pictured cutting her older  sister's wig, or when Hank is finally shown reaching out toward his aunt.  But of all the film's many well executed moments, nothing can match the  story's touching and emotional ending for its shear impact and genuine  humanity. Watching this film is pure cinematic joy. There are moments of  pure hilarity, and scenes so moving that the viewer's heart almost stops.  There is no bathos, or sentiment in this movie.
