2966459,1,B000WCBVQS,"Formula on 1960s show that was good.  This one is not. The Turner and Hooch formulas just don't work any more.  Wasn't this a remake of two or three dog movies, one with Hanks and one with Belushi? Dogs,  magical powers, good casting. This one just doesn't rose to the level of poor characters,  especially poor choices of breeds other than the beagle. Man,  don't waste time.  Kids will be bored as well the grownups who will choose something more interesting.",1484697600,,461,4.62962962962963

2966495,1,B000WCBVQS,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,,1188,4.8088235294117645

Seamless emotional bond with the canine talent.  And all i can say is, ""Give me your f-o-o-o-o-o-o-d.  Give me your f-o-o-o-o-o-o-d.""

The jokes? They're good.

The pratfalls? Just as good!

The cast? Simply awesome!

The CGI?  Perfect!

This is a must own for any family.  It is just as funny and entertaining the second and third time around.  And this movie once again proves that James Belushi is one of the nicest guys on the planet.  He manages to come across as the typical cool Joe-America!

However, Shoeshine was a wise-cracking dog and not a humble shoeshine dog/boy? The movie had some mild chuckles. The movie played up looking at the world from a canine point of view pretty well. I was disappointed they made the Underdog theme song a rap. There is a ""Scrubs"" episode where the song was sung acapella by a barbershop type group. It worked very well. In my opinion, they should had followed that lead or mixed it up some. The movie didn't do anything really creative. The actors were ok. The plot was predictable.

In summary, the movie was ok. The humor was the strongest part of the movie and the canine/human relationship works somewhat. Don't expect too much and definitely rent don't buy.",1227571200,,824,4.605442176870748

2966675,4,B000WCBVQS,"This film is perfect for family memebers of all age.  Being 47 myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  What is great about it is that it takes itself seriously.  Being a real person version of the famous Underdog cartoon could have been a silly endeavor and been just another B movie but everyone involved is of the highest caliber and truly takes the task upon them seriously.

The dog playing Underdog is truly adorable and Jason Lee does an excellent job of being the voice of the infamous dog.  He is very funny while being very endearing.  The dog, through many mishaps I will leave for you to discover, enters the life of retire policeman James Belushi and his teenage son who are dealing with the loss of their wife/mother.  James Beluxshi can sometimes be over the top but here he downplays and is very credible as the troubled excop.

The relationship that develops between the boy and the dog - Shoeshine/Underdog is the heart of the film.  The pure fact that the producers managed to make a film about a superhero dog that is funny, endearing and has a lot of heart shows the heart that was put into making it.

2966679,2,B000WCBVQS,"I don't want to be too harsh on this little 'kiddies' movie, but lets be honest, 'Under Dog' is a 40 year old cartoon and this movie should have been geared towards adult fans. It would be OK to make it tame enough for kids to enjoy too. Instead, we get a weird reinvention of the old classic cartoon. First off having Jason Lee voice Under Dog was not the best decision as he is so well know from his ' My Name Is Earl' series that I couldn't get the show out of my mind and I expected Crab-Man to pop in at any minute and say ""Hey Earl""!.

The FX are done well, but it's a pretty bland movie. It's also a very short film well under an hour an a half.....this is probably a good thing, but I would have felt cheated if I paid $10.00 to see an hour an 10 minute movie(if you don't count the credits)! If you have kids I'm sure they will like it, but if you're an adult looking for some sort of nostalgia....forget it. ;-b",1212278400,4,921,3.9783783783783786

An animated super-mutt was truly the rage!
Voiced by Wally Cox, the lovable geek,
The dog always rhymed, whenever he'd speak.

Underdog was the Mighty Mouse of his time,
Saving the city and always in rhyme!
And while some may feel a 'live' update is trivial,
I find this new movie entirely convivial!

Frederik Du Chau directs with a wink,
And the result isn't as silly as many might think!
Jason Lee's voice, while not as nerdy as Cox's,
Is warm and beagle-friendly, whenever he talks!

The animals, not humans, are the stars of this flick,
Although Peter Dinklage's Barsinister is a real kick!
At 4'5"", he's teamed with 6'3"" Patrick Warburton,
And they steal every scene until the final curtain!

I loved the references to ""Superman, the Movie"",
And as a sixties kid, I found everything groovy!
Of course, since it's Disney, it carries his stamp,
With a romantic send-up of ""Lady and the Tramp"".

So Mom and Dad, make your little ones happy,
Buy this doggy gem, and make it snappy!
It's family-friendly, so there's no need to fear,
They'll thank you and exclaim, ""Underdog is HERE!""",1207785600,19,1124,4.714285714285714

2966690,2,B000WCBVQS,"Some movies just don't sound all that appealing from the moment you hear about them. Case in point, Disney's newest film ""Underdog"" based on the classic cartoon series about a crime fighting super dog. The premise is stupid, just as it was on the cartoon, but the cartoon still managed to entertain audiences in its day and it still does with reruns whenever they air. But when I heard that Disney was making a live-action adaptation of the cartoon, I thought this is going to be a really stupid, most likely crappy movie. But then I saw a preview for the movie, and my opinion changed, the preview showed that the movie had decent acting talents Jim Belushi, Peter Dinklage, Patrick Warburton, and Jason Lee; the film also seemed to be full of humor, with a little bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure (a must when adapting a cartoon); and it seemed that the movie actually had good special effects for making a flying, talking, superhero dog believable. So, I went from not caring if I ever saw the movie, to actually looking forward to getting to sit down to watch it.

""Underdog"" is the story of an ordinary beagle named Shoeshine (voiced by Jason Lee) who through a series of unforeseen accidents; finds himself in a lab operated by a mad scientist named Dr. Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). When Barsinister tries to experiment on Shoeshine, the dog breaks free causing a devastating accident in the lab, and he is exposed to an experimental chemical that leaves him with super powers such as flight, strength and the ability to talk. After breaking free of the lab, Shoeshine finds himself a new home with a security guard (Jim Belushi) and his son, where he determines that his newfound powers can be used to save the citizens of Capital City from evil as the crime fighter, Underdog. However, when Barsinister, along with his henchman Cad (Patrick Warburton), discovers that this new hero, Underdog, is actually their escaped beagle, they will stop at nothing until the dog is returned to them, leaving the fates of those Shoeshine/Underdog cares for hanging in the balance. Now, all that remains is for us to hear those famous heroic words, ""This looks like a job for Superm...err, umm... oops, wrong movie, here's what I meant, ""There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!"".

Well, here's the lesson that I learned from watching Disney's new film, ""Underdog"". Sometimes it's better to go with your initial gut instinct, instead of letting your mind be changed by smart marketing types who know how to properly edit batches of film together to make a fun, entertaining trailer that will get your attention and make you want to see the film, even though your better judgment is telling you that there's no reason at all that you should even be tempted to watch it.

The problems I had with ""Underdog"" are not major, but they are big enough gripes to take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. The story isn't anything spectacular by any means; I mean it is supposed to be a kids movie that is adapted from a classic kids cartoon. When a studio sets out to make a kids movie, which is something that Disney does quite often (though to varying degrees of success as of late), then the filmmaker(s) and the writer(s) should feel some obligation to entertain the parents on some level, not the entire time necessarily, but at least a little bit. Especially, when the subject matter is taken from a classic cartoon series that some of these parents most likely watched and loved as kids, therefore I think there should at least be some kind of joke or sight gag or something that adults would get and enjoy as well. Now, I'm not saying there needs to be some kind of raunchy humor, by no means is that what I'm implying, you still keep the family-friendly tone, but there are ways to inject humor aimed more at adults without getting dirty, `Looney Toons' used to do it all the time in their animated shorts, so why can't the current crop of creative types come up with anything?

The casting choices for this film were good, for the most part; some of the more talented members of the cast seemed wasted in their roles. Jim Belushi and Patrick Warburton are two very funny actors (in my opinion), but in this film neither funnyman is given much to do. Jim Belushi has had great success with his hit sitcom ""According to Jim"" on ABC, and with various movie projects throughout the years, but in this film it seemed like they didn't want him to be funny, which is fine he's done drama as well, and he's good at it, but his material is just so paper thin that I'm surprised he even signed on to the film. I mean, his character basically exists as a plot device to get the dog, Shoeshine, into a loving home, setting up for the obligatory shenanigans around the home that have been done to death in other movies, except here they can take things a little more extreme due to the whole super powered dog trick. Now, Disney has used Patrick Warburton in at least one of their previous films the hit animated movie ""The Emperor's New Groove"", he was the hilarious not-so evil, evil sidekick Kronk, who essentially stole the show, even got his own sequel ""Kronk's New Groove"". In this film, just like Jim Belushi, Patrick's character seems like a waste of time, he's given a few funny lines to say, but other than that he pretty much just stands around with nothing to do. With two solid comedic actors in such thankless roles, it makes me wonder was the script much funnier before filming or editing took place or were the paychecks just too good to resist? Actor Jason Lee (better known as Earl on TV's ""My Name is Earl"") was decent as the voice of Shoeshine/Underdog, he gave the character a likeable charm and sharp wit, but truth be told, any other actor could have done just as good, it's not like he has crafted a character that people will only remember his voice associated with. Peter Dinklage was good as the evil Dr. Barsinister, he seemed to be enjoying the role and being allowed to ham it up, but after awhile even his character seemed to have less and less to do. The younger actors (the one playing Jim Belushi's son and his would-be girlfriend) were alright, but both seemed inexperienced, and their performances felt stiff because of this.

The special effects employed in this film were all very well done. I was surprised that for a kids movie that was adapted from a cartoon that the effects looked much more realistic than cartoonish. The flying scenes in particular were really well done, especially the sequence where Underdog is squaring off against three other super powered dogs working for the evil Barsinister. Basically, the effects are the only real highlight for this film, at least from an adult's perspective; kids will no doubt be entertained throughout the entire duration of the movie.

Overall, ""Underdog"" is an average movie, that's aimed solely at kids with little to no humor that ever manages to get above the level of cute. So, you parents out there who may believe that the movie looked good based on the previews (in case your curious this is a case where most of the funny parts are in the previews) and your fond memories of the cartoon series, don't expect too much from the end result. You will most likely wind up just as disappointed as I was, but at least your kids will be happy, so at least you'll have that.

2966695,4,B000WCBVQS,"Ok, I admit I watched too many Underdog cartoons as a child. Much to my wife's dismay I flip this movie into the DVD player just after midnight on new years (hey, it's fair game I had to sit through Sweeney Todd for her). Were lounged across the living room floor, and I have the home theatre system up way too loud as usual (Yes, I still like to play my music way too loud too).

  The opening moments of the film were a little disappointing for me. It starts slow, and there are some tawdry moments in this script for sure. That being said it's a super hero movie!!! I mean do you really expect superb scripts and shakespearian acting? There is no plot, the acting is very disney channel in delivery, and there were a few lines children won't get that weren't funny to adults (and I felt a little inappropriate for a childrens movie). That all being said I actually enjoyed the movie. The cheesy lines were actually funny to me. The generic plot actually works for the movie, and the super hero dog is cute. I give it 3.8 stars. It really is a shame they didn't clean up the movie just a little. They could have made this a G film and it would have gotten 4.5 stars from me. As it stands it has some inappropriate innuendo I don't feel is appropriate for a childrens film. They just didn't target the right audience. Parents bring their children to these movies for the children. No need for secret innuendo in a failed attempt to entertain the parents as well.

Hopefully (and I don't normally say this) there will be a sequel. I'd like to see the boy-dog character's relationship developed more along with the father. And I hope for new (or revisited?) villains as well.",1199145600,,680,5.0625
2966697,3,B000WCBVQS,"Underdog has a quite a fascinating history, which can be read in the book ""How Underdog Was Born,"" or heard on an interview with co-creator Buck Biggers (whose daughter appears in one of the DVD special features) on the wonderful Time Travel Radio show.

It seems that he and Chet Stover created and produced the original Underdog, Tennessee Tuxedo and other Total Television cartoons as clandestine moonlighting projects when they worked at a major New York ad agency, having meetings in their cars, sending a British front man to present the storyboards and making millions, especially for Underdog, which has become a pop culture icon and a beloved Macy's Thanksgiving Parade balloon. The DVD does include a short documentary segment that acknowledges the original series creators (you have to click on a ""dig deeper"" icon to see it).

This 2007 film adaptation might have fallen under the ""what were they thinking?"" category, had it not been for the undeniable success of recent big-screen versions of small screen cartoons and sitcoms. As these sort of films go, this twist on the early 60's limited animation series is passable for a Saturday matinee potboiler in the Disney mold of ""The Monkey's Uncle"" and ""The Ugly Dachshund.""

The film strangely tries to take itself too seriously at times but also wants to be a campy comedy and teeters between both with a few too many gags about various gasses and sniffs for some parents' comfort.  I must say, though, that I did enjoy the ""Lady and the Tramp""-like sequence at Tony's Restaurant, meatball and all.

But take a look at the cast list and you might be surprised: hey everybody, it's ""Enchanted's"" Princess Giselle - the wondrous Amy Adams - doing the voice of Sweet Polly Purebred! You can even see her at the microphone in the bloopers section For fans of the very grown-up AMC series ""Mad Men"" will spot John Slattery is the mayor. And ""Daily Show"" viewers will smile to see Samantha Bee.

I only wish the filmmakers had made more of an effort to reference the series. Perhaps they tried and couldn't make it work; as a creative person in a large organization, I'm no stranger to how a project can succumb to well-intentioned meddling. It can be tricky to keep fans of the original happy while breaking in a new audience.

The other challenge this film faced was that the cartoon show is no longer widely played on broadcast TV, so it's not likely that kids were clamoring to see this as much as they would be to see, say, a live action Spongebob feature. When the first Flintstone feature made such a hit in theaters, Cartoon Network was still running the original show.

The special features include deleted scenes hosted by director (and former animator) Frederik Du Chau, some bloopers (real ones, not the faux bloopers in the final credits), a rap video with the appealing Kyle Massey, of the Disney Channel comedy ""Cory in the House,"" performing the theme song which also plays over the end credits (it would have been nice to hear the original theme too, which occurred in the first Spiderman film).",1198627200,,3069,4.7882797731569

2966700,4,B000WCBVQS,"When I was a kid, one of my favorite cartoon heroes was Underdog.  He was like Superman, only not as serious and certainly not as skilled.  His city had to have been running out of phone booths, because every time he changed from his secret identity of Shoeshine Boy to Underdog, the phone booth blew up.  Super, yeah.  But not so talented.

And he talked in rhyme.  Everything was a couplet.  His questions and answers all rhymed and there was never any explanation as to why he had a quirk like that.  Best of all, the character was voiced by Wally Cox, who had the nerd voice down pat and whose underplayed emotions even at critical times were terrifically funny.

The cartoon series started in 1964 and ran for 124 episodes.  It was revived again and again as comic books, and even as a radio show, but never as a movie until Walt Disney films produced it and released it in 2007.

My son watched the movie in the theater and thought it was great.  He's ten, older than I was when I first discovered Underdog.  The movie is also live-action (with MAJOR CGI effects) which lends itself to the younger crowd.  And it stars a cute beagle as the main character.  If you're a kid, what's not to love?

I sat down with my son and popped the DVD into the player.  Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much, but I can be a ten year old kid with the best of them.  When the remix of the show's theme song came on, I have to admit that I got excited and carried away, and even started singing along (the words that I could remember).

The movie gave Underdog a police dog background that I wasn't exactly ecstatic about.  But it had him screwing up and immediately drawing sympathy, so it worked.

In fact, the story pulls in the origins of so many things that weren't explained in Underdog's original cartoon run.  Never once did the series tell how Underdog got his powers.  It did mention the Underdog Super Energy Vitamin Pill, which gave Underdog a ""lift,"" and that got edited out to some degree once drug awareness started kicking into the kid's cartoon.  But no one mentioned where the pills came from.  The movie takes care of that, but it doesn't give Underdog the nifty little ring he kept his Underdog pill in.

The movie explains where the costume came from as well as the name.  It even tells viewers how Underdog got the name Shoeshine, which my son and I found particularly hilarious.

Some of the cartoon purists seem to hate the movie, but I thought it was really well done.  It brought the idea of a super-powered dog into the real world (well, as ""real"" as that could be) and paired him up with a kid (Jack played by Alex Neuberger).  Their dialogue and twist on the normal boy/dog relationship is great.

Peter Dinklage stars as Simon Bar Sinister, the diminutive mad scientist that constantly plagued Underdog in the cartoon series.  There are moments when he steals the show and he is awesome.  Patrick Warburton, his hair appropriately styled, stars as Cad, Simon's henchman, and is a riot with his deadpan delivery and his thesaurus that only has the P section left.

Although UNDERDOG isn't the most stunning film ever made, it's a great family film.  The pacing moves along so that even the little guys will be kept entertained, and the characterization (and Jason Lee's voice portrayal of Underdog) is well done.  It's a goofy little movie well worth watching, and will probably be watched again by the kids.

The special features section is well done, and most of the kid will be interested in the behind-the-scenes feature showing how everything was done.  I know my kid loved the sections where they showed how the dogs were put into wire harnesses to ""fly.""

This is one for the kids, and one for the grownups who can remember being kids.  There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!",1198195200,,3801,4.5323529411764705
2966701,3,B000WCBVQS,"Underdog is the story of your average police beagle. He's supposed to be trained to sniff out bombs, but he's, well, bombed out at that job. Dejected after his most recent failure (hams and bombs smell alike, right?), he sets out alone on the streets.

He's quickly picked up by Cad (Patrick Warburton) and taken to the lab of the mad Dr. Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). When the bad doc tries to inject him with something, he starts running around the lab, accidentally knocking over a shelf full of bottles. From these comes his super powers of speech, speed, strength, flying, you name it.

Underdog manages to get himself adopted by a recently widowed father (Jim Belushi) with a bitter son (Alex Neuberger). But Dr. Barsinister is continuing his evil scheme. Will he find Underdog? Can a small dog stop the mad scientist?

Never having watched the old cartoon show, I can't compare this film to its source material.  I might have missed a few jokes as a result.  But I found this to be only an average film.  The story is predictable, but it was entertaining enough to hold my interest.  There were some great one-liners, but too much bathroom humor for my tastes.  I have a feeling the target audience of kids will enjoy it more then I did.

Not surprisingly, the special effects were great.  The acting was fine, but nothing outstanding.  The exception to that was Patrick Warburton and Peter Dinklage.  They play the villains slightly over the top, and the result was perfect.  They were more funny then scary, although a couple scenes in the lab might frighten young children.

2966703,4,B000WCBVQS,"At least for me he's back. As a kid growing up in the sixties I loved watching the ""UNDERDOG SHOW""! Underdog was not the most graceful superhero (blowing up telephone booths, accidentally crashing through walls and destroying buildings left and right),but he was a true hero through and through. His catch theme ""there's no need to fear underdog is here""  very popular back then(Underdog always talkled in rhyme). and he was loved by many(myself included). I also always loved the Underdog theme which included the lyrics""a cry goes out from far and near for Underdog""!

Past movies made from books or tv shows didn't fair to well (A Wrinkle in Time could have done much better if it was truer to the book). But, the preview of the movie looked promising.

Kids are going to flip out over Underdog, I'm telling ya! Everyone in the theater seemed to love this movie as well with all the laughter that was heard during the film. One thing this film does remind us is that dogs say the darndest things. Underdog (voiced by Jason Lee of ""My Name is Earl"") has a nack of making you burst into laughter from the goofy quotes and funny antics this character displays.

I say to the people giving negative feedback about this movie, they are just barking up the wrong tree. Most of which probably did not even watch the movie and just follow the popular false beliefs on how movies are made. I have a strong feeling that people will be barking all about this movie and it will be very successful in Theater viewings and DVD sales. Underdog is most certainly ""Top Dog"" when it comes to blockbuster movies for the month of August!
Purchase this movie today and thank me later.

What's the story:
The world needs a hero and man needs a best friend. They get them both when a scientific experiment goes wrong, leaving an ordinary beagle (oddly named Shoeshine Boy) with extraordinary abilities. What kind of abilities? He can fly! He can speak contemporary American English! He doesn't seem to mind wearing a sweater and cape! And, he's curiously monogamous! That's right; he's after the (literally) fetching Polly Purebread. So when she and all of Capitol City are under threat of destruction by a sinister plot, only a certain anthropomorphic canine can save the day! After all, who doesn't like rooting for an underdog?

Three Good Reasons

  * You loved the cartoon as a kid. You can't wait to see if Disney did it justice or ruined it.
  * Jason Lee's voice work as Syndrome in The Incredibles was convincingly creepy. Now that he's playing the good guy, kids won't be quite as scared of him.
  * Indie-film favorite Peter Dinklage gets nasty as Simon Barsinsinter, with sitcom stalwart Patrick Warburton as his lug of a henchman.

Bet You Didn't Know
This is the first screenplay credit for two of the movie's writers, but it's old hat for score composer Randy Edelman. He's won 10 BMI Film Music Awards, including 2003's Career Achievement Award.",1196467200,3,2519,4.612975391498882
2966706,4,B000WCBVQS,"When I first heard that Disney was going to be putting out a live action version of ""Underdog,"" I cringed at the thought. How could one make a live action film based on a cartoon who's key character was A) a dog, B) interacted freely with humans and other animals and C) was definitely a product of its times? Sure, the ""Scooby-Doo"" films have been out for awhile, but Scooby (and his cousins) were the only animals that interacted with anyone and their update was a fair success. Although Disney's answer wasn't 100% perfect, it was definitely a good response.

What the writers did was simplify the original tale somewhat. Instead of having Underdog interact with humans by being a shoeshine boy, he became an out-of-luck former police dog who's picked up by the caring-but-tense family of James Belushi and Alex Neuberger. They name him ""Shoeshine."" They also made the rest of the animals, namely Polly and Riff-Raff, only interact with Underdog and not the humans. Lastly, they firmly planted this film in 2007 by updating the lingo, the music, and the science that created Underdog.

Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage) and Cad (Patrick Warburton) are along for the ride and just like in the old TV show, they are Underdog's primary adversaries. Jason Lee provides the voice of the super pup, and gives him a refreshing update that I'm sure will tick off fans of the original cartoon.

The story, as mentioned earlier, is based around a not-so-hot police dog who's literally laughed off of the force by his comrades. He's picked up by Barsinister and Cad and becomes Underdog through a lab accident. He escapes from Barsinister and is picked up by another has-been cop, James Belushi. He's taken in by Belushi and his son and begins to form a strong bond with the boy. The rest of the story centers around Barsinister trying to capture Underdog to use his powers to take over the city and, eventually, the world. Along the way Shoeshine/Underdog falls for Polly, his new family gets closer, and he struggles with a catchphrase.

Sure, the story is simplistic and entirely unbelievable, but this is still a very good film to take your children to. I don't recall any harsh language but there is a little bit of violence and some puppy peril. At one point a particular pup gets into a deadly situation that might scare very young children. Just know that all turns out well in the end and I promise that your kids will be smiling before the movie is over.

This isn't a great film, but it is a very good family flick. The cast do an excellent job with what they have to work with and the special effects are of a similar (but slightly better) grade as those in other recent live-action flicks that involve CGI characters. I'm especially fond of Underdog's take-offs when he heads to the air.

Fans of the original series will probably cry foul over what has happened to their beloved Underdog. They do have a legitimate gripe but this film wasn't made to recall a ton of memories. It was made to draw in a modern crowd of youngsters and their families (some of which may not have even heard of the original show). The bottomline is this: It's a good family show that is enjoyable for both kids and their parents. Haggle over the changes if you must, but in the end, Disney has a winner with ""Underdog.""",1195689600,46,3304,4.63931623931624
2966707,2,B000WCBVQS,"Almost everything you fear this is going to be, it is -- cheesy, dull, loud, overproduced, under-inspired and a waste of talent. The film's only saving grace is it isn't offensive. You can let your kids watch it without worry.

Stay away from it, though, if you're a fan of the beloved original series. After the title sequence, this movie has no respect for the old television show and never approaches its waggish sense of humor.

Seamless emotional bond with the canine talent.  And all i can say is, ""Give me your f-o-o-o-o-o-o-d.  Give me your f-o-o-o-o-o-o-d.""

I was disappointed they made the Underdog theme song a rap. There is a ""Scrubs"" episode where the song was sung acapella by a barbershop type group. It worked very well. In my opinion, they should had followed that lead or mixed it up some. The movie didn't do anything really creative. The actors were ok. The plot was predictable.

In summary, the movie was ok. The humor was the strongest part of the movie and the canine/human relationship works somewhat. Don't expect too much and definitely rent don't buy.",1227571200,,824,4.605442176870748

Being a real person version of the famous Underdog cartoon could have been a silly endeavor and been just another B movie but everyone involved is of the highest caliber and truly takes the task upon them seriously.

The dog playing Underdog is truly adorable and Jason Lee does an excellent job of being the voice of the infamous dog.  He is very funny while being very endearing.  The dog, through many mishaps I will leave for you to discover, enters the life of retire policeman James Belushi and his teenage son who are dealing with the loss of their wife/mother.  James Beluxshi can sometimes be over the top but here he downplays and is very credible as the troubled excop.

The relationship that develops between the boy and the dog - Shoeshine/Underdog is the heart of the film.  The pure fact that the producers managed to make a film about a superhero dog that is funny, endearing and has a lot of heart shows the heart that was put into making it.

It would be OK to make it tame enough for kids to enjoy too. Instead, we get a weird reinvention of the old classic cartoon. First off having Jason Lee voice Under Dog was not the best decision as he is so well know from his ' My Name Is Earl' series that I couldn't get the show out of my mind and I expected Crab-Man to pop in at any minute and say ""Hey Earl""!.

The FX are done well, but it's a pretty bland movie. It's also a very short film well under an hour an a half.....this is probably a good thing, but I would have felt cheated if I paid $10.00 to see an hour an 10 minute movie(if you don't count the credits)!

An animated super-mutt was truly the rage!
Voiced by Wally Cox, the lovable geek,
The dog always rhymed, whenever he'd speak.

Underdog was the Mighty Mouse of his time,
Saving the city and always in rhyme!
And while some may feel a 'live' update is trivial,
I find this new movie entirely convivial!

Frederik Du Chau directs with a wink,
And the result isn't as silly as many might think!
Jason Lee's voice, while not as nerdy as Cox's,
Is warm and beagle-friendly, whenever he talks!

The animals, not humans, are the stars of this flick,
Although Peter Dinklage's Barsinister is a real kick!
At 4'5"", he's teamed with 6'3"" Patrick Warburton,
And they steal every scene until the final curtain!

I loved the references to ""Superman, the Movie"",
And as a sixties kid, I found everything groovy!

With a romantic send-up of ""Lady and the Tramp"".

3201187,2,B000WCBVQS,"Some movies just don't sound all that appealing from the moment you hear about them. Case in point, Disney's newest film ""Underdog"" based on the classic cartoon series about a crime fighting super dog. The premise is stupid, just as it was on the cartoon, but the cartoon still managed to entertain audiences in its day and it still does with reruns whenever they air. But when I heard that Disney was making a live-action adaptation of the cartoon, I thought this is going to be a really stupid, most likely crappy movie. But then I saw a preview for the movie, and my opinion changed, the preview showed that the movie had decent acting talents Jim Belushi, Peter Dinklage, Patrick Warburton, and Jason Lee; the film also seemed to be full of humor, with a little bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure (a must when adapting a cartoon); and it seemed that the movie actually had good special effects for making a flying, talking, superhero dog believable. So, I went from not caring if I ever saw the movie, to actually looking forward to getting to sit down to watch it.

""Underdog"" is the story of an ordinary beagle named Shoeshine (voiced by Jason Lee) who through a series of unforeseen accidents; finds himself in a lab operated by a mad scientist named Dr. Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). When Barsinister tries to experiment on Shoeshine, the dog breaks free causing a devastating accident in the lab, and he is exposed to an experimental chemical that leaves him with super powers such as flight, strength and the ability to talk. After breaking free of the lab, Shoeshine finds himself a new home with a security guard (Jim Belushi) and his son, where he determines that his newfound powers can be used to save the citizens of Capital City from evil as the crime fighter, Underdog. However, when Barsinister, along with his henchman Cad (Patrick Warburton), discovers that this new hero, Underdog, is actually their escaped beagle, they will stop at nothing until the dog is returned to them, leaving the fates of those Shoeshine/Underdog cares for hanging in the balance. Now, all that remains is for us to hear those famous heroic words, ""This looks like a job for Superm...err, umm... oops, wrong movie, here's what I meant, ""There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!"".

Well, here's the lesson that I learned from watching Disney's new film, ""Underdog"". Sometimes it's better to go with your initial gut instinct, instead of letting your mind be changed by smart marketing types who know how to properly edit batches of film together to make a fun, entertaining trailer that will get your attention and make you want to see the film, even though your better judgment is telling you that there's no reason at all that you should even be tempted to watch it.

The problems I had with ""Underdog"" are not major, but they are big enough gripes to take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. The story isn't anything spectacular by any means; I mean it is supposed to be a kids movie that is adapted from a classic kids cartoon. When a studio sets out to make a kids movie, which is something that Disney does quite often (though to varying degrees of success as of late), then the filmmaker(s) and the writer(s) should feel some obligation to entertain the parents on some level, not the entire time necessarily, but at least a little bit. Especially, when the subject matter is taken from a classic cartoon series that some of these parents most likely watched and loved as kids, therefore I think there should at least be some kind of joke or sight gag or something that adults would get and enjoy as well. Now, I'm not saying there needs to be some kind of raunchy humor, by no means is that what I'm implying, you still keep the family-friendly tone, but there are ways to inject humor aimed more at adults without getting dirty, `Looney Toons' used to do it all the time in their animated shorts, so why can't the current crop of creative types come up with anything?

The casting choices for this film were good, for the most part; some of the more talented members of the cast seemed wasted in their roles. Jim Belushi and Patrick Warburton are two very funny actors (in my opinion), but in this film neither funnyman is given much to do. Jim Belushi has had great success with his hit sitcom ""According to Jim"" on ABC, and with various movie projects throughout the years, but in this film it seemed like they didn't want him to be funny, which is fine he's done drama as well, and he's good at it, but his material is just so paper thin that I'm surprised he even signed on to the film. I mean, his character basically exists as a plot device to get the dog, Shoeshine, into a loving home, setting up for the obligatory shenanigans around the home that have been done to death in other movies, except here they can take things a little more extreme due to the whole super powered dog trick. Now, Disney has used Patrick Warburton in at least one of their previous films the hit animated movie ""The Emperor's New Groove"", he was the hilarious not-so evil, evil sidekick Kronk, who essentially stole the show, even got his own sequel ""Kronk's New Groove"". In this film, just like Jim Belushi, Patrick's character seems like a waste of time, he's given a few funny lines to say, but other than that he pretty much just stands around with nothing to do. With two solid comedic actors in such thankless roles, it makes me wonder was the script much funnier before filming or editing took place or were the paychecks just too good to resist? Actor Jason Lee (better known as Earl on TV's ""My Name is Earl"") was decent as the voice of Shoeshine/Underdog, he gave the character a likeable charm and sharp wit, but truth be told, any other actor could have done just as good, it's not like he has crafted a character that people will only remember his voice associated with. Peter Dinklage was good as the evil Dr. Barsinister, he seemed to be enjoying the role and being allowed to ham it up, but after awhile even his character seemed to have less and less to do. The younger actors (the one playing Jim Belushi's son and his would-be girlfriend) were alright, but both seemed inexperienced, and their performances felt stiff because of this.

The special effects employed in this film were all very well done. I was surprised that for a kids movie that was adapted from a cartoon that the effects looked much more realistic than cartoonish. The flying scenes in particular were really well done, especially the sequence where Underdog is squaring off against three other super powered dogs working for the evil Barsinister. Basically, the effects are the only real highlight for this film, at least from an adult's perspective; kids will no doubt be entertained throughout the entire duration of the movie.

Overall, ""Underdog"" is an average movie, that's aimed solely at kids with little to no humor that ever manages to get above the level of cute. So, you parents out there who may believe that the movie looked good based on the previews (in case your curious this is a case where most of the funny parts are in the previews) and your fond memories of the cartoon series, don't expect too much from the end result. You will most likely wind up just as disappointed as I was, but at least your kids will be happy, so at least you'll have that.

3201192,4,B000WCBVQS,"Ok, I admit I watched too many Underdog cartoons as a child.

Were lounged across the living room floor, and I have the home theatre system up way too loud as usual (Yes, I still like to play my music way too loud too).

  The opening moments of the film were a little disappointing for me. It starts slow, and there are some tawdry moments in this script for sure. That being said it's a super hero movie!!! I mean do you really expect superb scripts and shakespearian acting? There is no plot, the acting is very disney channel in delivery, and there were a few lines children won't get that weren't funny to adults (and I felt a little inappropriate for a childrens movie). That all being said I actually enjoyed the movie. The cheesy lines were actually funny to me. The generic plot actually works for the movie, and the super hero dog is cute. I give it 3.8 stars. It really is a shame they didn't clean up the movie just a little. They could have made this a G film and it would have gotten 4.5 stars from me. As it stands it has some inappropriate innuendo I don't feel is appropriate for a childrens film. They just didn't target the right audience.

3201194,3,B000WCBVQS,"Underdog has a quite a fascinating history, which can be read in the book ""How Underdog Was Born,"" or heard on an interview with co-creator Buck Biggers (whose daughter appears in one of the DVD special features) on the wonderful Time Travel Radio show.

It seems that he and Chet Stover created and produced the original Underdog, Tennessee Tuxedo and other Total Television cartoons as clandestine moonlighting projects when they worked at a major New York ad agency, having meetings in their cars, sending a British front man to present the storyboards and making millions, especially for Underdog, which has become a pop culture icon and a beloved Macy's Thanksgiving Parade balloon. The DVD does include a short documentary segment that acknowledges the original series creators (you have to click on a ""dig deeper"" icon to see it).

This 2007 film adaptation might have fallen under the ""what were they thinking?"" category, had it not been for the undeniable success of recent big-screen versions of small screen cartoons and sitcoms. As these sort of films go, this twist on the early 60's limited animation series is passable for a Saturday matinee potboiler in the Disney mold of ""The Monkey's Uncle"" and ""The Ugly Dachshund.""

The film strangely tries to take itself too seriously at times but also wants to be a campy comedy and teeters between both with a few too many gags about various gasses and sniffs for some parents' comfort.  I must say, though, that I did enjoy the ""Lady and the Tramp""-like sequence at Tony's Restaurant, meatball and all.

But take a look at the cast list and you might be surprised: hey everybody, it's ""Enchanted's"" Princess Giselle - the wondrous Amy Adams - doing the voice of Sweet Polly Purebred! You can even see her at the microphone in the bloopers section For fans of the very grown-up AMC series ""Mad Men"" will spot John Slattery is the mayor. And ""Daily Show"" viewers will smile to see Samantha Bee.

I only wish the filmmakers had made more of an effort to reference the series. Perhaps they tried and couldn't make it work; as a creative person in a large organization, I'm no stranger to how a project can succumb to well-intentioned meddling. It can be tricky to keep fans of the original happy while breaking in a new audience.

The other challenge this film faced was that the cartoon show is no longer widely played on broadcast TV, so it's not likely that kids were clamoring to see this as much as they would be to see, say, a live action Spongebob feature. When the first Flintstone feature made such a hit in theaters, Cartoon Network was still running the original show.

The special features include deleted scenes hosted by director (and former animator) Frederik Du Chau, some bloopers (real ones, not the faux bloopers in the final credits), a rap video with the appealing Kyle Massey, of the Disney Channel comedy ""Cory in the House,"" performing the theme song which also plays over the end credits (it would have been nice to hear the original theme too, which occurred in the first Spiderman film).",1198627200,,3069,4.7882797731569

Best of all, the character was voiced by Wally Cox, who had the nerd voice down pat and whose underplayed emotions even at critical times were terrifically funny.

The cartoon series started in 1964 and ran for 124 episodes.  It was revived again and again as comic books, and even as a radio show, but never as a movie until Walt Disney films produced it and released it in 2007.

My son watched the movie in the theater and thought it was great.  He's ten, older than I was when I first discovered Underdog.  The movie is also live-action (with MAJOR CGI effects) which lends itself to the younger crowd.  And it stars a cute beagle as the main character.  If you're a kid, what's not to love?

I sat down with my son and popped the DVD into the player.  Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much, but I can be a ten year old kid with the best of them.  When the remix of the show's theme song came on, I have to admit that I got excited and carried away, and even started singing along (the words that I could remember).

The movie gave Underdog a police dog background that I wasn't exactly ecstatic about.  But it had him screwing up and immediately drawing sympathy, so it worked.

In fact, the story pulls in the origins of so many things that weren't explained in Underdog's original cartoon run.  Never once did the series tell how Underdog got his powers.  It did mention the Underdog Super Energy Vitamin Pill, which gave Underdog a ""lift,"" and that got edited out to some degree once drug awareness started kicking into the kid's cartoon.  But no one mentioned where the pills came from.  The movie takes care of that, but it doesn't give Underdog the nifty little ring he kept his Underdog pill in.

The movie explains where the costume came from as well as the name.  It even tells viewers how Underdog got the name Shoeshine, which my son and I found particularly hilarious.

Some of the cartoon purists seem to hate the movie, but I thought it was really well done.  It brought the idea of a super-powered dog into the real world (well, as ""real"" as that could be) and paired him up with a kid (Jack played by Alex Neuberger).  Their dialogue and twist on the normal boy/dog relationship is great.

Peter Dinklage stars as Simon Bar Sinister, the diminutive mad scientist that constantly plagued Underdog in the cartoon series.  There are moments when he steals the show and he is awesome.  Patrick Warburton, his hair appropriately styled, stars as Cad, Simon's henchman, and is a riot with his deadpan delivery and his thesaurus that only has the P section left.

Although UNDERDOG isn't the most stunning film ever made, it's a great family film.  The pacing moves along so that even the little guys will be kept entertained, and the characterization (and Jason Lee's voice portrayal of Underdog) is well done.  It's a goofy little movie well worth watching, and will probably be watched again by the kids.

The special features section is well done, and most of the kid will be interested in the behind-the-scenes feature showing how everything was done.  I know my kid loved the sections where they showed how the dogs were put into wire harnesses to ""fly.""

This is one for the kids, and one for the grownups who can remember being kids.  There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!",1198195200,,3801,4.5323529411764705
3201198,3,B000WCBVQS,"Underdog is the story of your average police beagle. He's supposed to be trained to sniff out bombs, but he's, well, bombed out at that job. Dejected after his most recent failure (hams and bombs smell alike, right?), he sets out alone on the streets.

He's quickly picked up by Cad (Patrick Warburton) and taken to the lab of the mad Dr. Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). When the bad doc tries to inject him with something, he starts running around the lab, accidentally knocking over a shelf full of bottles. From these comes his super powers of speech, speed, strength, flying, you name it.

Underdog manages to get himself adopted by a recently widowed father (Jim Belushi) with a bitter son (Alex Neuberger). But Dr. Barsinister is continuing his evil scheme. Will he find Underdog? Can a small dog stop the mad scientist?

Never having watched the old cartoon show, I can't compare this film to its source material.  I might have missed a few jokes as a result.  But I found this to be only an average film.  The story is predictable, but it was entertaining enough to hold my interest.  There were some great one-liners, but too much bathroom humor for my tastes.  I have a feeling the target audience of kids will enjoy it more then I did.

Not surprisingly, the special effects were great.  The acting was fine, but nothing outstanding.  The exception to that was Patrick Warburton and Peter Dinklage.  They play the villains slightly over the top, and the result was perfect.  They were more funny then scary, although a couple scenes in the lab might frighten young children.

This is a movie aimed at kids that is best left to them.  They'll enjoy it, but adults will want to find something else to entertain them.",1198022400,7,1723,4.677740863787376

3201200,4,B000WCBVQS,"At least for me he's back. As a kid growing up in the sixties I loved watching the ""UNDERDOG SHOW""! Underdog was not the most graceful superhero (blowing up telephone booths, accidentally crashing through walls and destroying buildings left and right),but he was a true hero through and through. His catch theme ""there's no need to fear underdog is here""  very popular back then(Underdog always talkled in rhyme). and he was loved by many(myself included). I also always loved the Underdog theme which included the lyrics""a cry goes out from far and near for Underdog""! So when I first learned that Disney is making a live action version of the show I decided to hold judgement until I saw it. Past movies made from books or tv shows didn't fair to well (A Wrinkle in Time could have done much better if it was truer to the book). But, the preview of the movie looked promising. So I decided to just buy the movie rather than renting. I was not disappointed! The movie was great! It was very true to the original tv series(of coures some changes had to be made), but none-the-less it was a great movie. Fun for all ages 6 to 106! Those who choose to talk down the movie are just to rigid! I should know, I grew-up watching Underdog back in the sixties. True everyone has their own taste, but, I can't imagine anyone who loved Underdog not liking this movie, it's just good clean fun!!!(Maybe that's why some people don't like it, no bad language, no sex, no adult themes and no real violence.)Oh well you can't please everybody.

I just went and watched this movie on opening night and I have to say this movie is worth 4 paws and one tail up! It's a grrrrreat film that will leave you laughing the whole way through the film. Kids are going to flip out over Underdog, I'm telling ya! Everyone in the theater seemed to love this movie as well with all the laughter that was heard during the film. One thing this film does remind us is that dogs say the darndest things. Underdog (voiced by Jason Lee of ""My Name is Earl"") has a nack of making you burst into laughter from the goofy quotes and funny antics this character displays.

I say to the people giving negative feedback about this movie, they are just barking up the wrong tree. Most of which probably did not even watch the movie and just follow the popular false beliefs on how movies are made. I have a strong feeling that people will be barking all about this movie and it will be very successful in Theater viewings and DVD sales. Underdog is most certainly ""Top Dog"" when it comes to blockbuster movies for the month of August!
Purchase this movie today and thank me later.

What's the story:
The world needs a hero and man needs a best friend. They get them both when a scientific experiment goes wrong, leaving an ordinary beagle (oddly named Shoeshine Boy) with extraordinary abilities. What kind of abilities? He can fly! He can speak contemporary American English! He doesn't seem to mind wearing a sweater and cape! And, he's curiously monogamous! That's right; he's after the (literally) fetching Polly Purebread. So when she and all of Capitol City are under threat of destruction by a sinister plot, only a certain anthropomorphic canine can save the day! After all, who doesn't like rooting for an underdog?

Three Good Reasons

  * You loved the cartoon as a kid. You can't wait to see if Disney did it justice or ruined it.
  * Jason Lee's voice work as Syndrome in The Incredibles was convincingly creepy. Now that he's playing the good guy, kids won't be quite as scared of him.
  * Indie-film favorite Peter Dinklage gets nasty as Simon Barsinsinter, with sitcom stalwart Patrick Warburton as his lug of a henchman.

Bet You Didn't Know
This is the first screenplay credit for two of the movie's writers, but it's old hat for score composer Randy Edelman. He's won 10 BMI Film Music Awards, including 2003's Career Achievement Award.",1196467200,3,2519,4.612975391498882
3201203,4,B000WCBVQS,"When I first heard that Disney was going to be putting out a live action version of ""Underdog,"" I cringed at the thought. How could one make a live action film based on a cartoon who's key character was A) a dog, B) interacted freely with humans and other animals and C) was definitely a product of its times? Sure, the ""Scooby-Doo"" films have been out for awhile, but Scooby (and his cousins) were the only animals that interacted with anyone and their update was a fair success. Although Disney's answer wasn't 100% perfect, it was definitely a good response.

What the writers did was simplify the original tale somewhat. Instead of having Underdog interact with humans by being a shoeshine boy, he became an out-of-luck former police dog who's picked up by the caring-but-tense family of James Belushi and Alex Neuberger. They name him ""Shoeshine."" They also made the rest of the animals, namely Polly and Riff-Raff, only interact with Underdog and not the humans. Lastly, they firmly planted this film in 2007 by updating the lingo, the music, and the science that created Underdog.

Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage) and Cad (Patrick Warburton) are along for the ride and just like in the old TV show, they are Underdog's primary adversaries. Jason Lee provides the voice of the super pup, and gives him a refreshing update that I'm sure will tick off fans of the original cartoon.

The story, as mentioned earlier, is based around a not-so-hot police dog who's literally laughed off of the force by his comrades. He's picked up by Barsinister and Cad and becomes Underdog through a lab accident. He escapes from Barsinister and is picked up by another has-been cop, James Belushi. He's taken in by Belushi and his son and begins to form a strong bond with the boy. The rest of the story centers around Barsinister trying to capture Underdog to use his powers to take over the city and, eventually, the world. Along the way Shoeshine/Underdog falls for Polly, his new family gets closer, and he struggles with a catchphrase.

Sure, the story is simplistic and entirely unbelievable, but this is still a very good film to take your children to. I don't recall any harsh language but there is a little bit of violence and some puppy peril. At one point a particular pup gets into a deadly situation that might scare very young children. Just know that all turns out well in the end and I promise that your kids will be smiling before the movie is over.

This isn't a great film, but it is a very good family flick. The cast do an excellent job with what they have to work with and the special effects are of a similar (but slightly better) grade as those in other recent live-action flicks that involve CGI characters. I'm especially fond of Underdog's take-offs when he heads to the air.

Fans of the original series will probably cry foul over what has happened to their beloved Underdog. They do have a legitimate gripe but this film wasn't made to recall a ton of memories. It was made to draw in a modern crowd of youngsters and their families (some of which may not have even heard of the original show). The bottomline is this: It's a good family show that is enjoyable for both kids and their parents. Haggle over the changes if you must, but in the end, Disney has a winner with ""Underdog.""",1195689600,46,3304,4.63931623931624
