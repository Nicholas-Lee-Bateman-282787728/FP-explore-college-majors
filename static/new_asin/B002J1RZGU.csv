8371310,5,B002J1RZGU,"Lionel Fanthorpe is a magnificent story-teller with a delicious voice.  I WISH this had been a CD or CD set rather than a video on DVD.  The production values were low (basically videotape of a radio interview Fanthorpe did with someone.)  Also my mental image of the man based on his voice came to a crashing blow once I actually SAW him.

On the other hand, something is better than nothing.  This is, as far as I know, the only available interview of this fascinating man aside from a few podcasts perhaps still available on Coast to Coast.
I'm glad I have the DVD.  If I found more, I'd buy them because his repertoire of stories, as well as his way of telling them, are fascinating in a weird world sort of way.",1332028800,,716,4.345864661654136
