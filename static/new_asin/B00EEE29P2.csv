MacMurray is a judge who spent 6 years riding the circuit as a judge with the idea that at the end of this service in the circuit he could buy a house and settle down with the woman he has loved but not yet married for the six years. However, during the 6 years, she fell in love with a grandstanding young handsome sheriff who is a coward.
The judge finds a killer guilty in a trial and he is to be hung. However, four gunmen come to town and threaten its citizens. As a result, the town people, including its leaders, want the judge to let the killer go. MacMurray tries to get people to help him hang the killer and protect him from the gunmen.",1464566400,,706,4.086330935251799
