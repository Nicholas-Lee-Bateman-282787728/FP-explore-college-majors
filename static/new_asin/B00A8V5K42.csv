As caught by a surveillance camera, a janitor uses a large trash can to haul stolen items, including his boss's TV set.
The groom's had one too many, so he passes out at the altar faster than the bride can say, ""I do.""

DISC THREE--

A small boy becomes curious about what is under a girl's bikini.

8548494,4,B00A8V5K42,"when i checked the reviews on this movie I remembered reading that this movie was 'pretty good' though not as good as the first one (A Day In The LIfe)  and I agree. but, i liked it! I watch it once in a while. Both movies capture my company's attention when they walk in and I have one of sticky fingaz movies on..",1409011200,,315,4.0
8548495,3,B00A8V5K42,"I am a massive fan of Onyx and Sticky Fingaz, so was deco gonna give this one a watch. I also loved 'Day in the Life,' which was a similar style. I thought the film was definitely entertaining, clever and funny at parts, especially the first third of the film. Unfortunately, the acting got pretty terrible after halfway through and it felt rushed and badly edited towards the end. A shame though 'cause it certainly had the potential to be a really good film if more time was spent on making the film.
Either way though, I was really entertained by it and would definitely watch it again despite its shortcomings.",1401235200,,614,4.54054054054054
