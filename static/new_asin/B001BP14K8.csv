This movie adds pretty women, sometimes naked, as selling point.

3496648,3,B001BP14K8,"Redemption USA continues to release its back catalog of Italian Horror with Director Renato Polselli's unbelievably incoherent 'BLACK MAGIC RITES' aka 'THE REINCARNATION OF ISABEL' aka 'RITI,MAGIE NERE E SEGRETE ORGE DEL TRECENTO'- 1973 in 1080P Blu-Ray.  Released on both VHS and DVD over a decade ago under its alternate title, 'THE REINCARNATION OF ISABEL', the transfer is virtually identical with a few cleaned up speckles and sharper image. The film has the notoriety of being totally incomprehensible by Euro Trash enthusiasts and they would be right.  From my stand point, it seems that a modern day vampire (Count Dracula, perhaps?) is planning an arranged marriage between his daughter and a villager.  Haunted by the death of his beloved Isabel who was burned at the stake for being both a witch and vampire, he uses a satanic sect made up of the wedding party to resurrect poor Isabel's ravaged body sacrificing mostly the female guests in, you guessed it, blood sacrifices. It sounds better written down because the viewer may not see it that way at all.  The cast includes Mickey Hargitay who made many Euro genre titles along with his then wife Jayne Mansfield and Polselli regular Rita Calderoni who was great in Director Luigi Batzella's delirious guilty pleasure 'NUDE FOR SATAN' aka 'NUDA PER SATANA'-1974. Director Polselli used most of the same cast in his previous Horror excursion 'DELIRIUM' aka 'DELIRIO CALDO' -1972.  Polselli, who's most famous title is the second film of an early sixties gothic vampire trilogy 'L'AMANTE DEL VAMPIRO' aka 'THE VAMPIRE AND THE BALLERINA'- 1960 (which has yet to see a Digital release) gives the film an Ed Wood like feel of surrealistic numbness reminding one of Wood's film 'NIGHT OF THE GHOULS'-1960.  It almost makes you want to turn off the English subtitles and try to watch the film on your own making up your own storyline with the images unfolding.  The music is by Progressive Rock great Gianfranco Reverberi who produced the Italian band 'LE ORME's first five albums and also made a few solo albums finally creating and playing in the excellent late Eighties classical rock band 'RONDO VENEZIANO' and moves the film along at a fine clip.  Recommended to Euro Trash fans, it may not be worth the upgrade if you already have the Image/Redemption DVD.  Trailers to other Italian horrors are the Blu-Ray's only extras.",1367020800,6,2384,5.0
3496649,4,B001BP14K8,"(AKA 'The Reincarnation Of Isabel' 1973) - Before we go any further, if you're going to watch this flick, please do so in Italian with subtitles, as the English dubbed version is unwatchable. Not that anything will elevate this perverse gem of a sexually-overheated occult oddity to the status of a 'good' film, but those of us who revel in such insanity will be able to enjoy properly, as director Renato Polselli ('Delirium') intended. The blu-ray remastering is decent, but didn't blow me away, as I already owned the earlier Redemption release. But it improves the contrast dramatically, which is a sore spot for many 70's Eurohorror flicks, so I was grateful for that.

This one starts with a woman being burned alive at the stake for being a witch to the bass line and percussion of Santana's 'Soul Sacrifice' while some psychedelic credits roll over Mario Bava-esque colors shining on the faces of the attendant villagers, so we know what kind of a schlocky treat we're in store for from the get-go. Other reviewers seem to take these films way too seriously, as they were never intended to be. The key ingredients were a Eurogothic horror homage to the Universal classics, sex and gratuitous violence that wasn't permissable before 1968 when the codes were revised (usually heaped upon women back in those days for not staying at home + rearing kids while keeping working dads liquored up after a tough day at the office), pervasive nudity, drug use prevalent at that time, and more nudity. 'Gotta love it for what it was, not is - know what I mean?

Five centuries later, we're witness to a black magic ceremony involving a naked woman chained to an altar while some dudes in red leotards and black capes invoke Satan to reincarnate the soul of Isabel (the burnt witch) who gets a chance to be reborn every night of the 25th moon. You see, Count Dracula was the lover of Isabel the witch, who petitioned the powers of Darkness to become the first vampire, and presides over the reincarnation rituals.

That's the extent of the ridiculous plot; the rest of the flick is all about naked women. Euro babes, to be exact, and we see them being tied up, burnt alive, fondled, scantily clad, buried alive, tortured, in cages, beaten with tree limbs, losing their virginity, getting felt up by vampires, sacrificed, groped by their doctors, pursued by priests and superstitious villagers, in lesbian trysts and all the hysteria and melodrama we've come to expect from these Italian psych-horror sleaze fests. REJOICE or RUN AWAY! (2 stars for the flick, 4 stars for the rest...).",1365292800,5,2580,4.806306306306307
3496650,1,B001BP14K8,Redemption should not have included this title . Its basically a a bad film and not worth remastering and issuing it in the blu ray format. The camera angles are such that you cannot really see any nudity and the whole direction of the plot ( if indeed there is one)is obscure. Don't waste your money and you should skip it even if you are a fan of this form of horror fantasy movies .The sound is no better and is shrill and tinny. I will not bother to view it again !!!! and will feel guilty to palm it off on Ebay !!!!,1353283200,2,521,4.019230769230769
3496651,5,B001BP14K8,"As long as you know what you're getting into you can have a lot of fun watching this overlooked Italian horror / nudie gem. Fans of 70s retro psychedelia / satanic cult movies will love this! It's a continuous horror fantasia filled with delirious depictions of fetishistic & satanic elements and it all takes place in and around a creepy old castle. It has all of the sensational elements you expect in horror movies of its era, it's never boring, and plays much like one long and twisted nightmare sequence. Lots of bloody scenes, some gore, lots of naked women (and yes, they are all GORGEOUS), strange satanic rituals and appropriately mesmerizing music. This movie is a fine example of the kind of movie that many fans of retro horror are always looking for. Sure it's 'cheesy' and melodramatic by modern standards but that's part of why we love these flicks. There is an undeniable charm to its continuous, unabashed displays of stark horror and sleaze. It also gets even better with each repeated viewing. If you like the aforementioned elements you should consider this as a purchase and not just a rental as you will most likely watch it many times.",1348185600,20,1158,4.737623762376238
3496652,2,B001BP14K8,"I love Redemption Films -- their DVDs and Blu Rays are excellent quality.  This is no exception.  Also known as The Reincarnation of Isabel under previous DVD versions, this movie starts out strange and doesn't let up.  There is a plethora of screaming, mind-bending flashbacks and double-takes, and the most extreme gel lighting ever.  On blu ray this all looks very attractive, even if the story makes little sense and will test the patience of the most devoted Italian horror buff.  Kudos to the actors who are able to play their parts through all this madness with straight faces.  I became bored with all the screaming and nonsensical blend of vampirism and ""black magic"" by the end -- oh, and yes I forgot, it also has humor in the way of an extremely goofy girl first seen at the engagement party of Isabel (hint: if you give a party like Polselli's party shown here, please hire security to keep the creepy guy who looks sort of like Donald Pleasance away).  Mickey Hargitay always livens things up, and here he makes a noble effort by looking very intense throughout.
Rita Calderoni is attractive (but not so much with a hole in her chest) and endures much throughout this film, while also giving quite a variety of intense expressions a thorough workout.  I couldn't keep anyone's name or identity/previous life or incarnation straight, but the key figure towards the end with the beard is given a deluxe gel lighting workout.

Much better is Polselli's Delirium, which is also very strange but at least has a fairly entertaining (not to mention feasible and logical, by comparison with this movie's) plot, and Hargitay's turn in that one has to be seen to be believed. If you like this, no doubt you will also want to check out Mickey Hargitay (former bodybuilder at one time married to Jayne Mansfield) in Bloody Pit of Horror, which is also a mad film that makes a lot more sense than this one.

You have been warned.  For a perfectly bizarre evening pair this with any Jean Rollin or Paul Naschy film.  Not recommended for anyone prone to epilepsy or seizure disorders, nor for those who get motion sickness from rapid cutting back and forth filming techniques.  Highly recommended for fans of gel lighting gone wild. Oh, and drugs are for people who can't handle Polselli films; or perhaps, Who needs peyote mixed with LSD and alcohol when you have a director who can outwierd David Lynch any day?",1347062400,7,2412,4.714285714285714

All of the acting was of the mechanical expression and motion variety, the storyline was weak, contrived, and fragmented, and the scenes were inconsistent and lacking in artistic quality.  Special effects were so badly done that the end effect was comedic, instead of horrific.
