2113124,5,B0002PYS5Q,"Like most of my favorite shows, I first saw ""The Simple Life"" by mistake.  I set my timer for a show that I usually watched during its time-slot, but instead recorded ""The Simple Life.""  From the previews the show look horrible and I had no want to view it.  But the night I was talking about, I was bored and decided it was better than nothing... good choice.  For the entire Hour I did not stop laughing! It was that good... I was blown away.

Now whenever I mention that I watch the show I always get teh same reaction ""What the hell are you thinking, your in AP English!""  But then once I have the people in question view an episode, they realize how funny and addictive the show is.

By no streach of the imagination is this a ""quality"" show... nor is it a show that is for the entire family (I would say 12/13 would be a good starting age).  But it has it charms.  Yes the girls PRETEND to be brainless, but in some ways they show that they actually have vaules and manners and that its good to use them... But then they blown your cover when they steal $100 of stuff at the local store or give the family a dog-food saucage.

The second season follows a different format than the first, instead of one family and one town for 3 months, they are put on a road trip from Florida to Beverly Hills.  Along the way, they have to earn (or beg) for evey cent they spend on their journey, while bunking up with host families.

If your in the mood for brainless comedy, this is the perfect show for you.",1091923200,13,1501,4.173611111111111

2113206,5,B0002PYS5Q,"Continuing with the same theme of Season One (the girls must hand over their cash, credit cards, and cell phones and live ""the simple life"" for 30 days), this season sees Paris and Nicole driving a pink pick-up truck, with a trailer attached, coast to coast, as they attempt to hold minimum-wage jobs at a variety of different establishments, including working as maids at a nudist resort. The girls manage to get themselves in trouble many times, nearly getting caught once.

2113208,5,B0002PYS5Q,I think this was the most intresting season of The Simple Life. It had some good laughs. I did especially love the nudist place and that was probably the best episode. So they featured all episodes fromm season 2 a bonus episode from season 1 and 30 minutes of bloopers. this is by far the best dvd set that I own,1369440000,,313,4.147540983606557

So of course i had to buy, who wouldnt want to own a halarious show like the simple life? This is a must have, just for the plain stupid and silliness that occurs.

2113211,5,B0002PYS5Q,"This show is all-around just fun. It's not meant to be some great television show, nor some extremely real reality show. It's just what it is.

I find it very funny to see grown people getting mad at this show and then making fun of Paris and Nicole for being stupid and spoiled. Because what those adults don't seem to understand is that the entire SHOW is making fun of Paris and Nicole being stupid and spoiled. Paris and Nicole are also BOTH making fun of themselves being stupid and spoiled. They have a good sense of humor about themselves and their public image, so they were making fun of it with this show. That was kind of the entire point.

I find it absolutely ridiculous that grown adults still have that mentality of ""NO! I'M ALLOWED TO MAKE FUN OF YOU BUT WHEN YOU JOIN IN AND START LAUGHING AT YOURSELF IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE."" Grow up, people. Stop taking everything so goddamn seriously.

The show is absolutely hilarious if you take it for what it is and just admire the girls for having a sense of humor about who they are. People just need to take a step down off of their OWN blue collar thrones and stop thinking that Paris and Nicole are beneath them simply because they're always in the spotlight. It's not a crime to be silly. In fact, it's BETTER not to take yourself too seriously. After all, what fun is life if you're acting like every single second needs to be spent with a serious look on your face?

This show is great at what it does. It's just a shame that some people are extremely prejudiced against the two girls.",1341100800,,1551,4.375

The show is very entertaining and funny, I love watching this 2 beautiful blondes acting so silly & pretending to be dumb spoiled loud mouth kids.  They are good actors, they played their parts real well.  I am sure it is purposely done just for the Camera.  In reality, they are well schooled, smart & intelligent human beings. They are also the Producers of the series, so they are good business women too. Some of the scenes are really hilarious, if you want a good laugh, then go see this one.",1306281600,,548,4.405940594059406
2113224,4,B0002PYS5Q,"Let's take two girls, both filthy rich
From the bright lights, down to the sticks
From velvet ropes to cattle pulls
Let's take away their limousines
Their credits cards and shoppin' sprees
Well they're both spoiled rotten
Will they cry when they hit bottom?
Heaven knows if they'll survive
This simple road trip kinda life

Where the hell are we?!

A year after wreaking havoc on the small town of Altus, Arkansas, willowy heiress Paris Hilton and impish party girl Nicole Richie are given a new challenge: traveling from South Beach, Miami to their posh Beverly Hills digs in a hot pink pick-up truck pulling an airstream trailer. Paris' pet Chihauhau Tinkerbell returns and Nicole's adorable, fiesty Shih Tzu Honey Child (love the name) is brought along for the journey.

Once again the pampered socialites' cell phones and credit cards are confiscated and they must work several jobs along the way in order to make it back home, including training for spots in Florida's Weeki Wachee Springs mermaid show (of course Paris gets to be the mermaid while poor Nicole looks ridiculous in her turtle costume), serving as maids at a nudist resort called Caliente, making a total mess of sausage making in Mississippi, and pulling pranks on customers at a Texas hair salon. Ya know, the usual.

The best thing about season 2 is how varied the host families are. Most of them are friendly (God bless the religious family that put up with Nicole's potty mouth), but a few aren't so nice. The son of a Mississippi family believes the girls will be rude and act as though they're above everything (well it's not like he was too far off the mark) so he decides to give them their comeuppance. Not a good idea to cross those two and let's just say he got his just desserts. WOOF! Despite that bit of revenge, the girls are much nicer this time around.

The DVD extras are more expansive and interesting than the ones from season 1. Trust me when I tell you that every bit of the half hour outtakes and deleted scenes reel is hilarious! Paris gets a chance to showcase her funny bone (who knew she had one?) while prank calling a man about a room for rent.

Paris: I'm an old man.
Guy: You sound like a girl.
Paris *while trying her hardest not to laugh*: I'm a cross dresser so I use 2 voices.

Also included is a lost episode from season 1 that's equally entertaining. Unfortunately the series would show cracks after this season. There were always scripted moments (this is ""reality tv"" after all), but it would become more obvious in seasons 3 to 5. Anyway, sit back, turn off your brain, and enjoy. And cringe when you need to. Sa da sa SAAAAA!!!!",1300060800,,2640,4.592356687898089
2113225,5,B0002PYS5Q,I LOVE this one i say its my favorite out of them all. Very funny when they are together even though im not a Paris fan but i absolutely adore Nicole she is the one that really makes the show in my opinion. What a personality and character she is. You love it!,1296518400,2,260,3.9245283018867925
2113226,5,B0002PYS5Q,"I loved this series.  It's basically mindless fun to watch these two girls go on adventures.  Paris is the calm quiet one, while Nicole is the crazy one who always seems to get them into some kind of trouble.  It makes for a pretty hillarious show :)",1294876800,,250,4.276595744680851
2113227,5,B0002PYS5Q,"In the next installment of this wildly hilarious series, famous for no reason celebrities, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie take their hijinks to the road. Their range of work includes maids at a nudist colony to helping a minor league baseball team prep. And they are sure to never miss a beat. Nicole Richie provides most of the humor, usually making absurd comments about her life as a ""masseuse in Korea twenty years ago,"" or telling a teenage boy that the girl he first kissed is ""knocked up on the street."" And as usual, Paris Hilton is shocked to discover that not everyone grows up in a mansion. The episodes are very short (each runs roughly twenty minutes), yet the humor and outrageous stunts these girls pull is well worth the money. For example, after ordering more food than they could pay for, Nicole tries to convince the manager that he gave her food with bitemarks in it and insists he take it back. Need I say more? Sure, there are other products that could be bought for this amount, but none will bring this much hilarity. I STRONGLY recommend this.",1286409600,2,1068,4.596858638743456
2113228,5,B0002PYS5Q,"This season was very funny! All of the seasons are funny but this one does stick out in our minds. Wasnt this the season that Paris and Nicole tried out as Mermaids?
Oh man that was funny! Liked the part where Nicole comments ""Thats very sexual"" when she's referring to the Mermaid and the Turtle...lol
Hilarious! The outtakes are funny too! The DVD is well worth it.

2113230,5,B0002PYS5Q,"Paris and Nicole are back for their second, and thusfar best season of their reality show, The Simple Life.  Here they are more experienced at what things will and won't give them laughs, and they have a real challenge to work for.  They are on a road trip to drive cross country from Florida to California, without any money or credit cards, having to live off the kindness of strangers.  People have done it without the luxury trailer and pick up they are living in.  Here they meet up with people for just a few days rather than having to live with them in extended circumstances.  They do everything from having to make sausage, be mermaids at an amusement park, to waxing a man's hairy back.  They can and will get themselves into a lot of trouble with people.

The only words of criticism are for that of Nicole rather than Paris.  For all their bumbling antics and silliness, Paris seems to be the more friendly and cooperative one.  Nicole is much ruder and abrasive with people, even when they are being harassed by the redneck teenage boy they have the misfortune of staying with for a spell.  She is not big enough to walk away from it, and instead gives him the special sausage that she made out of dog food for him.  Quite honestly, most sausage is probably close to dog food, but it's the thought that counts.",1231027200,,1323,4.470833333333333

2113234,5,B0002PYS5Q,"Coming into the second season strong Paris and Nicole know how to take the same senerio and make it fresh.  In fact, all three seasons so far have seen these two rich socialites plucked from the norm (to them) and placed in a place that seems foreign with people who just don't understand them.  The fact remains though, that these two girls survive by being themselves, incapable of work, unwilling to work, and unable to work...and they drive everyone insane and then redeem themselves with their charm and sweet hearts (they really are sweet girls)...So this season sees them cross country traveling from FL to Cali and the who way there they stop and live with families getting jobs you'd never expect them to do.  The funniest episodes involve the Local Police Dept. where they use their new power to harrass the locals & the Nudest Colony where they are hired as maids and end up posing as guests, charging food to the room and calling for another maid to clean the room.  Every episode is hilarious.  Who ever said Paris was only worth her sex tape hasn't seen 'The Simple Life'...oh and I must add that this show is a hoot MOSTLY because of Nicole Richie who is HISTERICAL!",1148342400,4,1181,4.604761904761904

I started laughing so hard I was crying while watching the antics of Paris and Nicole- I am sure my neighbors thought I  was  insane.  I  was lucky to catch all of SIMPLE LIFE 1 on the weekend marathon via E! Channel  and then rushed out to get the rest of SIMPLE LIFE 2 on dvd because I couldn't wait to see it.  I also rented SIMPLE LIFE 3.  Simple Life 2 is the best, then simple life 3 then Simple Life 1.  All are good. The MUST NOT miss episodes for Simple Life 2 are  working as maids at EL CALIENTE (the nudist colony )and the Sheriff Office  stint in texas  while the girls are staying at Click ranch.  If you are  in need of a spiritual lift via laughter I suggest you RUN  and get SL2.  Nicole is  a modern day Mae West and  people were making fun of me for loving this series.  OF COURSE they hadn't seen any of it  and saying they didn't want to watch those ""dumb"" girls.  It is obvious anyone who judges this without watching it is an  idiot.  I hope Nicole and Paris can mend their rift- I hear they are filming SL4 but without interacting ( huh??????!!!!).

My friends and I LOVE to sit around the tele and watch Paris and Nicole laugh their butts off. They are such a fun couple of girls, they spread laughter and joy around whenever we watch them.

Season 2 is just as funny as the first, though it does seem a bit more ""scripted"" versus the first season. The story isn't as fun to follow up on, but you get to see so many different kinds of people that its well worth it. This Seasons lacks the strings that held it together so well in the first, but all is repaired in season 3.

I love to watch this DVD and these young women make fools of themselves and everyone! Truly makes you wanna be a blonde! ;)

2113238,4,B0002PYS5Q,"Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are back after the popular first installment of The Simple Life and the second season proves to be better than the first. Giving up their cell phones and jumping into a pink trailer, the 2 socialites head for a crazy road trip filled with halarious misadventures. The journey includes a stop at a local fast food restaurant where the suddenly penniless gals order practically everything off the menu and then admit innocently that they're out of money. This is not the only time that ""no-money"" has entered the picture. They even try to help the police but turn things upside down as they serve lunch to inmates and speak to them when they're not supposed to. They also pull people over for no apparent reason.

Other episodes include them staying with a religious family, working as maids at a hotel, and there's even an unexpected accident involving Paris falling off a horse.

The Simple Life has become a guilty pleasure and a favorite among many people, including myself. The girls are practically posterchildren for ""no shame"" and it's hard to watch them make insanely silly mistakes. But Richie and Hilton are fun to watch.

2113241,4,B0002PYS5Q,"Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are not good role models. That is a given. They behave in a selfish and obnoxious way.

But once you start watching their antics, it's almost impossible to look away. It's enthralling, watching them show up to ""work"" in insanely inappropriate outfits. Making a dog food sausage and giving it to someone they dislike. Letting their dogs poop in the field during a baseball game. Living in a trailer park!

You just have to watch to see what's going to happen next, no matter how appalling it might be.

There are also some sweet moments, where you might actually find yourself liking the girls, a least a little bit. This is especially true in the episode in which they make a 13-year-old girl over for her first date and keep a watchful eye on the awkward pair. They seem genuinely interested in helping the girl.

Even if you sneer in digust at this spoiled pair, it's hard not to be entertained.",1127433600,4,928,4.572289156626506
2113242,4,B0002PYS5Q,"I caught a few random episodes and remained vaguely disinterested, but I've grown to love the show on dvd. The point where I realised the show had more going for it than just rich girls being high maintenance was the part where Nicole's making fun of the baseball players' stretching, ""Can you guys do it at the same time ... and touch each other while you do it"", and then trying to convince the opposing team's coach to cheer for her team, all the while Paris is just standing around trying to look pretty. Maybe Paris would actually be cool if she wasn't doing the fake cutesy voice and persona all the time, who knows, but anyone who finds the world at large to be an oppressively formal place will find comfort in Nicole's irreverent vulgarity.",1125446400,7,749,4.514705882352941

The locations, sets, storylines, production values, writing, directing, acting, all add up to a sexy, sensual television experience. The only quibble is I think they need to go overboard on the nudity. There's plenty now, but hey, always room for more, right?

Paris Hilton drives the large pink truck with the attached trailer. The girls stay with 6 different families throughout the trip. Each family is fun and have a different personality. Of course, the girls have to work at a new job assignment for each family their staying at. I don't know if Paris and Nicki are really stupid. I think it's all an act. Of course being educated and smart is dull and boring for a reality show or any show for that matter. I love all their outrageous antics. The only thing i don't like is that they don't work hardly at all at their job assignments or do a 1/4 a** crappy job. They can be crazy, stupid, wild-personality, flirtatious, and outrageous and work at the same time but they choose not to work but B*tch and whine and complain throughout their job assignments. Not only that, people's jobs are on the line and people who hire Nicki and Paris are blamed for such crappy work. Nicki and Paris should be ashamed of themselves. The son of one of the family confronts Nick and Paris and says ""I'm with Dumb and Dumber"". I totally agree. These girls can't do anything in real life except not work and shop complain about people. These girls are so freakin' pathetic.",1110672000,5,1328,4.3983739837398375
2113256,4,B0002PYS5Q,"I have no doubt at all that these episodes were staged (since when does a ""spontaneous"" show need a story editor?). Their contrivance annoys you at first and then the entertainment is so good that you forgive and forget. This is much funnier than the first season, which now seems almost solemn with its ""fish out of water"" premise. The party girls have to get across the country without any money. They beg and borrow, work as maids in a nudist colony, trap for crawfish in New Orleans, work/screw up in a sausage factory, etc. Both Paris and Nicole are more relaxed before the cameras. Great for more than a few laughs.",1108512000,3,621,4.553571428571429
2113257,4,B0002PYS5Q,"oh my gosh.  this show is SO funny.  i've watched these episodes over and over and over and i still laugh out loud.  paris and nicole are comedic geniuses.  seriously. plus this show has drama cause people get real pissed at these girls.  this is a good show to watch when you don't feel like watching anything, you know what i mean?  it's easy to take and the eps are only like 20 minutes.  they meet the trashiest people and it's just a great contrast.  i wish paris and nicole were my friends or my babysitters.  they would be hilarious either way.  JAMES, WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE A GOOD IMPRESSION.  the family in episode 4 are such trash and it's just funny.  cause i mean, WHO doesn't like laughing at trash?",1106265600,6,711,4.343511450381679

If you liked the first season, you will love the second.

I first noticed her getting out of a car on nerve.com...

Nicole is a riot and adds so much to the act.  Check her out

2113261,4,B0002PYS5Q,"The first season was good but this one is much better. The story now is that Paris and Nicole have to drive from Miami to Beverly Hills (they travel in a trailer). Once again without cash, credit cards or cell phones.

This season has 10 episodes, all them very funny but my favorites are the ones where they go to work to a hotel as housekeepings. It's very funny because instead of working they call room service like they were hotels guests and when they're eating they call a housekeeper to make the room they had to clean. And my other favorite one is when they go to work to a sausage factory and they simply make a mess. All the episodes are very good, like one they go to work to a men prison, in another they work in a beauty salon.

Paris and Nicole make a great couple, each one in her own style but finally they are outrageous.

This DVD contains great special features including a lost episode from season one and never before seen footage.

With this show you won't laugh a lot but you definitely won't get bored.

Finally I want to say that with the languages and subtitles appears that there are Spanish subtitles but they don't work. I don't know why maybe just happends with my disc because I've tried with 3 machines. Notice that if you don't speak English.",1100649600,17,1276,4.367088607594937

So if you do not have the 1st season buy it now cause its cheap and then when season 2 comes out buy that as well, you will not be dissapointed!",1094256000,5,390,3.768292682926829
2113277,5,B0002PYS5Q,"Yes, I do love it. Paris and Nicole are back for more fun this season as they mix it up by traveling all over America, on a road trip to get to LA. The frist season is a little better because you got to know they family they stated and really grew to like them. You don't really get to do that with this season, being the fact that the girls only stay with the family a day each. But this season is 100 times funnier, which is hard being the frist season is hilarious. Nicole Ritche shines doing the most outragous and funny things. Also, I can't go on without mentioning the top three famous lines from this show, spoken almost every five mintues: that's hot!"" by Paris, and, ""do you love it?"" and ""loves it"" by Nicole. You have to love the season just for that. If you're a fan of the girls or the frist season, or just looking for a good laugh pick up this DVD.",1094083200,6,864,4.088235294117647

2113281,5,B0002PYS5Q,"Wow...this shows amazing. I cant wait for the second season to come out on DVD! I love this show because it doesnt hide what it is- pure, vulgar entertainment. This show doesn't try to make you think or question, it simply tries to make you laugh, which is so refreshing. Though these girls might seem dumb, they are actually pretty smart. They know what sells, and they know how they are perceived by the public eye, and instead of trying to fight it (like most young celebrities), they embrace it.

2113282,1,B0002PYS5Q,"Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are spoiled, arrogant, ignorant, and self-centered. I can't believe The Simple Life has a second season, let alone a hit one, that is soon on its way to DVD. I really hope America watches the show to laugh at these women, because if they actually think there is any redeeming quality in them as human beings, that is sad. Both these girls, like Angelyne, are famous just because, with no purpose. They make millions off their stupidity, by doing nothing but making fun of others and laughing at anyone who is different. I live in L.A. and see girls like this all the time, but its horrible that we not only make these girls famous because of their stupidity, but get them richer than their parents already are because of it. If anyone is smart, they would stay away from this show before Paris Hilton becomes President of the USA and Nicole Richie becomes her First Lady.",1092441600,14,902,4.574074074074074
