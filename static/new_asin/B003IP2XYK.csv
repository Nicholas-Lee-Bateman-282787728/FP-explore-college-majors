8397580,2,B003IP2XYK,"The recording was done outdoors,  the sound quality is poor.  I will read more carefully next time to note that a recording is performed in a standard hall.  The performance itself is good; the sound quality a real disappointment.  I immediately put the recording back up for sale on Amazon.
The sound dissipates when in the open air.  Sort of like listening to chamber music in a large concert hall.",1390953600,5,400,4.6571428571428575
8397581,5,B003IP2XYK,"If I could give this DVD 10 stars, I would. Mostly because of Bronfman's playing of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3.

Aside from Richter's recording of Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Leinsdorf-led Chicago Symphony, the Bronfman/Berlin/Rattle performance has to be considered one of the greatest live performances of a piano concerto....ever.

The dialog between Bronfman and the orchestra is superb, and the setting is stunning. When the piece ended, the audience response was immediate and sustained. I almost thought I was at a rock concert. I have seen and heard a lot of classical concerts over my lifetime, and rarely have I seen an orchestra put down their instruments and clap, unrestrainedly, with the audience.

To say that I LOVE THIS RECORDING is an understatement. Bravo to Bronfman, bravo to Rattle and the Berlin Philharmoniker, and bravo to the audio and video technicians who made it possible for this performance to viewed over and over again.

(NOTE: the sound and picture ARE in synce on the Blu-Ray disc I bought. Thanks  to the Berliner Philharmoniker office for their advice.)",1377993600,,1109,5.104972375690608
8397582,5,B003IP2XYK,"This is a memorable release on several counts. The obvious one is that, unusually, the audience was treated to a heavy rainstorm during the second half of the concert but despite this the audience displays total good humour and absorption in the music regardless of the awful conditions. This reflects the quality of music making in what must be described as less than ideal circumstances.

The evening starts with four well-known items from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker - The overture, Christmas tree, March and Pas de deux. This music suits the Berliners perfectly showing their famed control and tonal resources to good effect.

Rachmaninov's 3rd piano Concerto follows with Yefim Bronfmann as the soloist who delivers a towering performance of comprehensive emotional range and subtlety. Bronfman demonstrates phenomenal technique that rides over all the hurdles at speeds and accuracy that is simply spellbinding and is combined with wonderful delicacy of touch as required on frequent occasions. The Berlin players respond with sonority and musicianship under the superbly attentive conductor, Simon Rattle, who maintains close eye contact with Bronfman for considerable stretches of time. The audience erupts with an utterly deserved and prolonged standing ovation having maintained rapt silence throughout. Even the orchestra exhibits their shared delight in what has been an especially memorable performance.

The Rite of Spring fills the majority of the second half. Rattle's long experience of the music and its complexity shows throughout with many details brought out to good effect. The orchestra responds with all the virtuosity at their considerable command. The audience's concentration persists despite heavy rain at intermittent points. Once again they are rewarded with an outstanding performance despite the demanding circumstances. (see below for comment about recording / playback levels).

There is an encore - the intrada pas de deux from the Nutcracker which is the perfect foil for the Stravinsky with washes of rich string tone, swooping woodwind and burnished brass topped with glittering percussion. Perfect. An ebullient Berliner Luft ends the evening as Simon Rattle leaves the podium to take up the cymbal, reminding us of his early days as percussionist in the National Youth Orchestra.

The HD imaging is superb and the sound, delivered in PCM 5.1 and stereo, is remarkably good considering the open-air nature of the venue and the awful weather conditions experienced through much of the second part of the concert. I would suggest that the playback level would benefit an increase of about 2 dB as the recording level appears to be slightly lower than usual. This benefits the Rite of Spring especially as it allows more internal detail to tell as well as adding more general weight. I have been unable to detect any hint of the synchronisation problems mentioned by another reviewer, neither on this Blu-ray nor on my previous DVD version.

This amounts to a fine concert in less than ideal circumstances with the Rachmaninov concerto being especially notable as a performance of tremendous stature.",1343520000,2,3133,5.383673469387755
8397583,5,B003IP2XYK,This is an excellent recording of the Rachmaninov #3.  It was a live outdoor concert.  The video was well done (but only 1080i).  I bought it solely for the Rachmaninov and haven't listened to the other performances.  This video convinced me that classical concert videos were worth buying.,1322438400,4,290,4.979166666666667
8397584,2,B003IP2XYK,"I was excited to have this blu-ray for my audiophile ,however as another review noted this is not a studio recording so don't expect the sound to be anything close to a CD even !! no stage the sound is so empty with kids crying in the bakground (very low and not anyoing to be fair)  that is why i gave it two star",1283040000,12,314,3.90625
8397585,5,B003IP2XYK,"I've been waiting for a live performance of a Rachmaninoff piece on Blu-ray for a long time and it's finally here! This is definitely worth it for Bronfman's powerful performance alone. The end of the third movement will leave you breathless and moved until he hits the very last note and the crowd bursts into applause giving a well-deserved standing ovation. Excellent video and sound quality bring the summer festival experience in your living room. Please bring more classical performances to Blu-ray!!! plleeaaassee

Bronfman's cadenza towards the end of the first movement of the Rachmaninoff concerto is worth it alone!!! so powerful!",1279929600,16,641,5.284313725490196
