It is really a muscle workout, but so ineffective in that regard.  I hesitate to donate it to the library -- someone else will get ""scammed"" by it!.",1508371200,,302,4.321428571428571
8256244,5,B0014T8CQ0,"This DVD is packed with menu options for a varied workout. It's a great value for your money to strengthen and tone the core area. The menu options include: 10 mixes; sections on resistance band only, medicine ball only, express and stretch; express for 30 and a 40+. Take time to view Trish' introduction where she will explain what muscles comprise the ""core"". Although, the resistance band makes up the majority of the DVD, she notes it is optional-but I've also used a loop together with various tensions of the resistance band. Trish leads a good enough pace where you have some time to adjust your band. The medicine ball used are two small sculpting balls. Majority of the exercises are on the floor. Overall, watch Trish only for the best form and technique; the modifier is behind her so the camera mainly focuses on the both of them. Most of her resistance band exercises are different from the usual ones since she is a medical professional, they are very functional-lots of rotations and extensions. Excellent, satisfying exercises. Bravo!",1263340800,3,1051,4.877094972067039
