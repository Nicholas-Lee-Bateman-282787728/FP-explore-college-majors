6137663,3,B00H7LCPGW,"Very exited when ordering but disappointed in the picture quality.  Appears to be 16mm and only fair at that.  However, it is the Rifleman and I just figured it was sort of like watching it on the tube in the late 50s.",1390003200,4,218,4.166666666666667
6137664,3,B00H7LCPGW,"I have been a long time Rifleman fan, since the start of the show in 1958, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new Official First Season, For $ 69 dollars I expected more. When I received it, the first thing I was looking for was the special features I was disappointed, There is only one original opening sequence with the firing of the rifle, and it was placed just before the Zane Grey Theatre Pilot of ""The Rifleman"" it does not belong there. The other special features include two advertising spots, of extremely poor quality.  When these episodes were re-mastered some time ago, ALL the original episode openings were scrapped and ONLY a Season Three opening is used for all five season, atleast on television, so it is safe to assume that when the other seasons are realed on DVD, we will ONLY see the Season three opening sequence. What will be really disappointing, is that the Season Four and Five opening sequences, which for many years appeared on the reruns were shown at the start of the season FIVE episodes, we will mostlikely never see them again. Levy, Gardner and Laven, please try and restore the ORIGINAL opening sequences in the future sets. These first season episodes atleast appear to be complete and with the original ending sequences. Where's the bloopers and possibly a few sponsor spots? In summary, for $69.00 a set I believe we should get a little more.  It took long enough to get a whole season set, room for improvement on Season Two,  Chuck {Lucas} would want it that way.",1389657600,94,1514,4.662921348314606

6137667,3,B00H7LCPGW,"The Rifleman is one of my favorite TV shows of all time!  However, when I popped the first disc into my machine, I noticed a lot of horizontal banding.  These thin, combing lines make things like hat brims look jagged and distort any details like faces - especially when the faces are talking, moving, or at a distance from the camera.  Thinking I had a bad disc, I put the others into the player - and saw the same thing.  I played them in another player, and got the same result.  The banding occurs only occasionally in some of the shows, and is worse in others, but it is there - and is distracting when it pops up.  Dennis Hopper hardly looked like Dennis Hopper at times!  I own the old MPI edition of the series, and all of those episodes do look a LOT cleaner than those in this new release.  Perhaps the positive reviews on video quality were from folks who had only seen bootlegged DVDs - I really don't know.  Even so, the series is still great!  I only hope the episodes in the following seasons get cleaned up to look better!  I really feel badly about deducting stars solely due to picture quality, because the writing and acting are fantastic!  These stories shouldn't be missed!
Update 14 Jan:  I returned my set, hoping the thin banding in the picture was a one-time fluke in the CDs.  Today I received the replacement set, and the combing lines are still in there, no matter what player is used.  Evidently, this must be an overall production flaw.  Amazon did an excellent job in the speed with which they sent out my re-order for replacement!  It was also unbelievable how quickly they refunded the cost of the first set, its original shipping cost and other fees!  Extraordinary customer service!",1389312000,79,1717,4.501618122977346

6137672,5,B00H7LCPGW,"I, too, watched The Rifleman in the 1950's as a child.  The action had the most meaning to me then.  Now, that I am much older, and have seen so much in life, the Rifleman series has far more significance.  Recommended viewing for all teenagers.  Like reading the novel Don Quixote, the Rifleman series is best viewed in all phases of life as its meaning will provide additional nuances as you become older.  As Chuck Connors said before he died, the series tells it like it is.  It teaches us that not everyone means us well but that we should keep an eye out for the good in everyone.  The series is so expertly written that it compresses an excellent moral play within just 24 minutes each episode.  The lessons taught in the series are timeless.

In my opinion, Chuck Connors, Johnny Crawford, and Paul Fix were all good people at heart in real life which came through in their acting in the series.  To me, probably the best overall casting ever.  In sum, the writers, cast and crew of the Rifleman probably had no idea that the series they produced would continue to be shown 60 years after it premiered, and will likely still be viewed centuries from now.  Many thanks to those who helped make this TV series!!!",1489190400,7,1218,4.486363636363636

6137692,5,B00H7LCPGW,"Boy, these are something special.
I didn't know what I was gonna get, being so old and all (the shows, I mean !)

Well, they arrived earlier than expected and the packaging was first-rate ; I opened them up and the dvds in their sleeves opened up concertina style. The inside flap has a booklet which is an episode synopsis and a program guide - all professionally presented.

The first episode is 'The Sharpshooter', which was the pilot episode. It starred Chuck, the terrific little Johnny Crawford, Leif Erickson, Sydney Blackmer, and Dennis Hopper (how's that for a supporting cast ?!)
Each subsequent episode has been remastered - I have only so far viewed 3 episodes and each was written by Sam Peckinpah !

These are wonderful shows and they so far, are imbued with a tremendous warmth and moral code ; I am very glad I bought them and the second series is on my waiting list.

ps  I am often critical and sometimes cynical about modern television ; get these shows if you want the best viewing experience and get them from North Fork General Merchandise - you will not be disappointed.",1431043200,5,1093,4.61340206185567

6137699,5,B00H7LCPGW,"What can you say about ""The Rifleman"".  I grew up with the show being in repeats and it is nice to watch the shows again.  The show was based upon a father and son starting and running a ranch.  The supporting cast is outstanding, guest stars and plot lines are also incredible.  I always got a kick out of the ""town"" sound-stage, because even as a kid I knew it was fake.  The rest of the show is generally filmed outdoors.  Somehow, you get used to it.  What a great show!  The father played by Chuck Connors is tough, stern, demands total honesty and yet, his son is his number one priority.  Definitely, one of the top westerns ever made.  Each show is based upon the half hour model, the packaging is top notch and the video quality awesome.  That said, the price for each season is on the high side.

Take it from me, this is a first rate, authorized version.  The only think I hate is that everyone is in this for the money.  They only give 20 of the episodes.

I've introduced many of my all time favourite western tv shows to my wife and I'm happy to say that this show is now one of her most favourite shows as well.
Plus having Chuck Connors introducing most episodes and explaining the story line is an added and most welcome extra for me.
If you like old westerns with good stories and lets face it most of the old westerns fall into this category, then you won't go wrong with buying this series, as there are plenty of episodes to keep you and the rest of the family entertained.

(All I've watched so far.).  Very nice surprise as I don't remember seeing that in any review and it's not listed as a Special Feature on the box.  Chuck passed in 1992 so the effort to add this must have been through the courtsey of the almighty.  

The character actors and stars that co-stared in these episodes where the best the golden age of TV produced. Every show is special.  The video quality is just as good or better in the shows I've seen so far.  Don't know why the 1 & 2folks are critical...the series was released 56 years ago.  Digital can only improve/repair so much.  But the picture quality is still better than AMC's broadcasts or other networks I've seen.  Audio is excellent!

I love this show...I am glad I waited for the real McCoy DVDs to be released and can't wait for the other seasons to come out as well.  This set is extra special as it's a gift from my wife!  Thank you Levy-Gardner-Laven,  keep The Rifleman comin'.....",1400025600,7,1129,4.381642512077295

6137743,5,B00H7LCPGW,"This is one of the best western series made. Chuck Connors, a former baseball player with the Dodgers, plays Lucas McCain the Rifleman of the title. A rancher bringing up his young son, played by Johnny Crawford, alone in the old west. Plenty of action-packed episodes with guest stars like Robert Vaughn, Dennis Hopper,Leif Erickson,Dan Blocker and Michael Landon, before they both became famous on another great western series ""Bonanza"".
Connors is called the rifleman because he only uses a rifle not a six-shooter like everybody else in the west. He is a renowned sharpshooter. Trying to live a peaceful life as a rancher trouble always seems to come their way not least because his best friend is the Marshal of North Fork played by Paul Fix who was the first Doctor on "" Star Trek"" before Dr McCoy. He appeared in only one episode and then was replaced. Here he always has Connors as his backup. Also he only has use of one arm as the other was injured in a gunfight earlier in is life.
In other reviews I have read there was a problem with the disc's and the picture was bad or would stick. Only a few had no problem. I took the chance and bought this show anyway in the hopes I would get a good copy .Thank goodness,I did. Don't know why others had problems. I only have a ordinary DVD player not a Blu-ray even though they say that this is compatible with normal DVD's. Since I mostly watch shows from the 50's, 60's and 70's I see no need to upgrade.
My only advice is that if you want this show  buy it in the hopes that, like me, it will work. If not return the DVD and wait for the problem to be resolved by the company and see how future seasons reviews are or wait until after they release all the seasons and then they might decide to release a boxed-set of the entire series.
Bonus features are the pilot of the show which aired on ""Zane Grey Theatre hosted by Dick Powell not seen here. The pilot is not remastered which is stated on the DVD.
Chuck Connors introduces some of the episodes. Also an interview with Arthur Gardner,one of the producers of the show and a photo gallery of publicity shots and behind the scenes as well.",1396224000,10,2148,4.383458646616542

6137745,5,B00H7LCPGW,"I was delighted when I learned The Rifleman series was finally going to be made available in its entirety 55 years after it first aired.  As a young man growing up in the 50s (and not necessarily a Western fan back then), I anxiously anticipated each weekly episode.  While I enjoyed the action and adventure of the old West, I was even more impressed with the historical bent of the life of a rancher trying to make a life for himself and his son in the 1870s in New Mexico.  In Lucas McCain, this program also gave young viewers a role model and strong values to strive for and incorporate in our own lives.  Some would tend to focus on the ""violence"" in some of the episodes, but that is definitely not the gist of The Rifleman.  Thematically, this TV series is about a father-son relationship and the values the father instills in his son.  In every episode, Lucas always uses reason, logic, intelligence, negotiation, and compromise in an attempt to solve his own problems or the problems that present themselves in North Folk.  Lucas only uses force when it is absolutely necessary to defend his home, his family, his friends, or the town of North Folk.  Lucas lives responsibly and always hopes to make things better in his community; he is a peaceable man and a wise man and defends what is right and just when necessary.  It sent a great message to those of us who were young at the time.

Another reason I am delighted to see this series is its value to the annals of television history.  After so many years, it can definitely be considered a classic and therefore should be preserved for future generations.  This can truly be said to be part of the Golden Age of Television with its strong writing, powerful acting (Chuck Connors, Johnny Crawford, Paul Fix), emphatic background music (Herschel Gilbert), and excellent camera work.  Good writing, good stories, and good TV series, as with things artistic, withstand the test of time.  This series does that.

I was impressed with the superb dvd quality; those who worked on the original film and the digital remastering did a fine job.  All episodes were crisp and clear.  I had no problem with play or menus on any of the eight dvds.

I don't have a problem with the pricing (currently $69.95) because I consider it a terrific value for the 40 episodes in Season 1 - this is only $1.75 per episode. Some people pay more than that for their monthly cellphone bills.  As with all things in the market place, if this is too pricey for your wallet, then you may want to wait until the price is more suitable to your taste.  As for me, The Rifleman Season 1, is worth every penny; but then, I'm an avid fan and am willing to pay what I consider a reasonable price for such a precious commodity.

As with all other Rifleman fans, I am enthused that Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions was finally able, after much hard work, to get this first season out to us.  And I look forward with keen anticipation to the release of the other seasons and adding them to the ""must-haves"" in my collection.  I highly recommend the Official Season 1 of The Rifleman to all dedicated fans.",1394323200,9,3127,4.554561717352415

My biggest let down is that with every DVD, when the disc is in the 'play all' menu selection, the sound and picture speed up, then go out of sync as the episode plays. The official website stated to me that no one else has complained to them about this. Playing the episodes one by one was not an issue when you access them individually from the 'episodes' menu. Have other customers taken notice of this? Most likely will exchange them after trying the DVDs in other players and computers.",1393113600,3,694,4.650406504065041

6137752,2,B00H7LCPGW,"Unfortunately my experience with The Rifleman season 1 eight-disc set has not been good.  Two of the eight discs will not playback reliably and will display on the screen of my TV ""Can not read this disc"" most of the time on disc #3 and #7.  And yes I viewed some of my 100+ DVD collection and rental DVDs before and after the noted issues with this set.  Returned to the set numerous times and the same issues persist.  No damage of the gatefold packaging or any viewable physical damage on any of the discs.

Image quality was fine/good and menu and options such as individual episode play or serial play were nice touches.  The number of chapter stops, I feel, were lacking, beginning and ending themes do not have their own chapter stops making for the need to fast forward.  I believe most would not want to repeatedly keep viewing and listening to the start and end themes after some point in time.

My DVD player is a Sony DVP-7700 that uses dual lasers and the TV is a Sony KV27XBR96S.  Older models to be sure and still working fine, NTSC standard non high definition.

On the plus side the gatefold package has nice illustrations and the each disc has different illustrations along with the title of each episode on the disc.  The hubs hold the discs with the right amount of tension keeping disc flex minimal.  Some discs overlap another disc making for some inconvenience.

My suggestion is to put effort into viewing a set ASAP so as to be well within the window of return.  This is the second DVD set I've encountered with serious playback issues.  The other set that was problematic was the entire series of the Outer Limits that was returned promptly.

My largest DVD set to date is the complete original Twilight Zone episodes at twenty-eight discs.  No issues at all with the discs while the disc holding hubs do not release the discs easily, the discs tend to flex during removal from gatefold packaging.  Not a deal breaker but a pain non the less.  At least there is no disc overlap.

I might be wrong but feel it should be voiced.  I believe the reason why some titles have issues and other don't is because the owner/studio did not place effort into quality control, a cost saving measure that would not be immediately apparent.",1392681600,9,2251,4.5497512437810945

Been watching The Rifleman on AMC (American Movie Channel) for several years, just haven't been able to catch every episode.  Those episodes are sharp and crisp, plus presented with little dust and debris.  So will continue to endure commercials.

6137759,1,B00H7LCPGW,"I watched the rifleman when I was young and loved it. I had my own rifle (daisy air rifle) as a boy and shot hundreds and hundreds of bad guys in my imagination playing in my backyard with friends. As an adult now and rewatching the series after 30 years, I am stunned by just how violent this ""classic"" TV series was. It didn't register on me as a boy, but it does as a man. Seemingly every 30 minute episode Lucas McCain guns down one, two, three or more people without so much as batting an eye. And the law (Marshall Micha) simply lets him do so without so much as a question. What lessons are being taught here? If you don't like someone? Shoot em'. Don't like the way they look at you? Shoot em'. Don't agree with something someone says? Shoot em'. I don't know what the actual body count was for this series. How many people did Lucas McCain shoot and kill during its run? Based on the 20 or so episodes I've rewatched, I'm guessing there had to be well over a hundred easily. And all without the law bothering him or spending a single night in jail. I'm not suggesting that watching this show will turn anyone in to a killer. However I don't like the lesson it teaches that guns solve problems or that the person with the biggest or fastest gun makes the rules and decides who else lives or dies while the law turns a blind eye. In retrospect, I wouldn't let my children watch it and when I compare it with Bonanza, I'm strained to try to think of any time that Ben, Hoss and Little Joe shot anyone. I think I'll show that to them instead.",1390608000,7,1547,4.212121212121212
6137760,5,B00H7LCPGW,"UPDATE 11/16/14:  I wrote this review (below) nearly a year ago. However, I am now very unhappy with the company that issued the Season One set last year and is about to issue Season Two in coming weeks -- because I went to Walmart earlier today and see the company is now retailing Season One volume 1 there,  and Walmart has the shelf price discounted down to $17.96 for the first 20 episodes.  I went to the company's website after I got home and they indicate they are marketing these now at Walmart to reach a wider audience, and that Season One volume 2 will also be available at Walmart early next year. The company claims that the extreme price reduction is due to no pictures from the episodes on the individual DVDs, and no booklet.

Well, that doesn't cut it.  Walmart customers will be able to buy the entire 40 episodes of Season One for $35.92 plus tax, after the DVD company stuck it to loyal fans like myself that have anxiously awaited for this series to be released. I paid $33.00 more than that last year for the complete set believing that would be the only way to purchase it.

They better not have a $69 price on Season Two in a few weeks when it's offered to fans like myself, as I will NOT buy it again if this is the tactic they are going to use.  Also, the company needs to speed up their release dates. It's been over a year since the release of Season One. Maybe if they hadn't been mass producing the split sets for retailing at Walmart, we could have had our Season Two or even Season Three sets by now. Shame on the production company for ripping off their own fans!

My original review follows:

I bought my set from The Rifleman official website before it became available on amazon. The release was delayed for nearly a year and when the website announced the purchase price, I was shocked and thought, no way will I pay that amount for one season. I already had the MPI multi-disc sets.

However, then I considered that there are 40 episodes on this set (the MPI sets had 20 episodes), it is the entire first season in the original running order, and these are on 8 one-sided discs.  If it had been marketed as individual discs each with 5 episodes on them, I'm sure the one-disc list price would have been $9.99-$14.99.  I therefore bit my lip and decided to buy it and decided if I didn't like it, wouldn't consider buying the second season when it is released (which considering how slow the production company was getting this out, could be another year).

I'm glad I bought it.  The DVDs are clearly labeled identifying 5 shows on each disc, plus have different photographs on each.  The multi-fold packaging provides easy access to the discs and is secure.  There is an interesting program guide included, describing each episode, original air date, plot synopsis and the cast in that episode.

I didn't expect pristine video quality and certainly not High Definition, but for 1950s-era black and white television broadcasts, the quality is quite good. The pilot episode from Zane Grey Theatre which is presented first is grainy and ragged.  The quality is better after the pilot, and really good after the first 7 or 8 earliest episodes.  Considering the age of these films and what I've seen before I think the clarity is improved.  I believe the company did as much as they could to provide quality here. I've been a fan and follower of this show since it was first broadcast, and noticed a few things here I'd never seemed to notice before, which surprises me - for example, smoke coming from the rifle in the opening sequence.  How could I not have noticed or paid any attention to that for 50+ years?!  Also in the pilot episode, behind Lucas when he is talking, it appears in the distant background that the reflection from a motorized vehicle can be seen moving from left to right along a roadway.  I also see a little more clarity revealing false backgrounds in a few scenes which I'd never noticed before.  Overall, I think the picture clarity is an improvement.

Finally, seeing the episodes in their original running order instead of pulled from different years on the same discs is revealing, watching the development of the characters and the comfort level of the actors working with one another.  Johnny Crawford was a good rider at a  young age, and an extremely good actor.  He has a sincerity and genuineness some other child actors of that era didn't have (for example, Jay North, who could play the part but wasn't so convincing and looked more like acting; he suffered from a lot of personal maneuvering and mistreatment behind the scenes). Chuck Connors is likewise a great western actor, and heroic not because of the violence resolving conflicts with the rifle each episode, but for his love, caring and affection for his son, and level-headed strong sense of justice and fairness. In fact the focus of the episodes isn't on the rifle, it's the relationship between the father and son. It's obvious that Chuck Connors and Johnny Crawford worked so well together as they obviously liked each other very much.

This series had a lot going for it at the time of its original broadcast, and I have never tired of it or seeing the same episodes time and again.  If you are a long-term fan, despite the cost of this DVD set, I think you will appreciate the episodes even if they are not in high definition.",1390003200,49,5365,4.575757575757576

8630550,5,B00H7LCPGW,"Greatest TV western of all time!! I have been watching reruns for 50 yrs. Quality is crystal clear. Just remember 1 thing, most of the time anyone that calls Lucas McCain sodbuster will more than likely eat lead at the end of the episode!!",1523750400,3,239,4.454545454545454
8630551,5,B00H7LCPGW,"The Rifleman (seasons 1-3, don't care for 4-5 much...I think they just ran out of good story lines) may just be the greatest of all the TV westerns.  The stories were interesting and suspenseful.  The pacing was just right and you almost always got the pay off in the end...which was of course Lucas firing off that rifle...pow! pow! pow! pow! pow! pow! as he gunned down the bad guy/s that finally got what he/they deserved by being evil creeps in the first 20 minutes of the show.

Chuck Connors is great as Lucas McCain.  That squinty steely stare of his and his towering figure forebode of just revenge.  Johnny Crawford as Mark McCain gave some truly impressive performances (especially the episode where he is bitten by a horse with anthrax).  I was lucky enough to meet Johnny as an adult...he was applying for a business license many years ago in the licensing division in the city for which I worked.  I must admit Paul Fix as Micah Torrance was not my favorite.  He didn't seem to really be that impressive as the marshal, but then the show was about Lucas and not him so it isn't his fault.  The guest stars were the same old ones you see in all the westerns but they give their usual good performances as bad guys.

Too bad we can't have westerns on TV today like back then with these key ingredients:  Right over wrong in clear black and white, no gray.  Justice is clear, quick and prevails.  Strong family values where the parent teaches morality to his child.  Well written episodes.  No politics.  Positive religious beliefs sprinkled in occasionally.  Can be watched by the entire family...no swearing, no inappropriate adult content.",1523404800,,1652,4.660899653979238
