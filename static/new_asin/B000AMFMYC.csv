8447460,2,B000AMFMYC,"I was quite excited to get this, since I was looking for a high quality copy of dominique moceanu's 1995 aa & ef routines. However, I was VERY disappointed to find that they CHANGED THE MUSIC to all of the floor routines featured on the tape! I suppose this was for copyright reasons, but I would not have bought it if i had known. Also, although all of dominiques routines are featured in the aa half of the tape, NONE of her ef routines were shown.",1307059200,,450,4.244186046511628
8447461,5,B000AMFMYC,"I have to say this is my favorite gymnastics competition ever !! It is the 1995 National Championships when Dominique Moceanu was in her first elite competition and when the world fell in love with little Dominique. The tape shows the All Around competition and then a quick look at the Individual Event Finals. It also has little fluff interviews on Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, and Donni Thompson !! It also shows all of their floor excersises, unlike some of the other gymnastics videos. I give this video two thumbs up !!",1211932800,,531,4.782608695652174
