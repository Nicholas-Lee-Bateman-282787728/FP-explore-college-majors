1658268,5,B00005RZQ6,"311's ""Enlarged To Show Detail 2"" is just friggen awesome. It contains so much more than the first one and has a lot more concert footage.
The movie this time around is not about them being interviewed as much as the first. This time it's more about their ""From Chaos"" tour (which I attended and loved) and it contains MANY more hilarious behind-the-scenes home-movies made while touring.  Some of the highlights are each band member's personal scene, Japan, 311-Day, and of course the 311 Milk Challenge which is the funniest thing I've seen in a looong time.
Some other things that are in the movie are footage from 311's ""Hive"", Halloween shows, Old School footage from when they first started out, some brief interviews with the band, the summer Weenie-Roast featuring a guest appearance by Shaq to sing the unreleased song ""Psycho"", and some other awesome things.
The DVD contains even more music videos than the first. It has videos for ""Transistor"", ""Prisoner"", ""Beautiful Disaster"", ""Come Original"", ""Flowing"", ""You Wouldn't Believe"", and ""I'll Be Here Awhile (Director's Cut). It also contains ""Making The Video"" episodes for ""Flowing"" and ""You Wouldn't Believe"". It also has a trailer for ETSD 1 and comes with a new bonus CD with more unreleased tracks.
A must buy for any 311 fan.
The movie runs for about 1 hour and 30 minutes. This one too has a parental advisory and is somewhat worse than the first. It contains explicit language, explicit drug content, and some sexual-humor.  The milk challenge is also not reccomended for the weak stomachs.",1045699200,8,1559,4.9465648854961835
1658269,5,B00005RZQ6,"Ok well..I was readin some other reviews and the one in particular said that ""they didn't like the behind the scenes footage"" well if they were a true fan of the band they would've appreciated it. Personally...I like it better than the first one there is more footage and more Nick Hexum so yeah!!!!! Rock on!!",1043107200,,310,4.553571428571429
1658270,2,B00005RZQ6,"There were a couple of things I looked forward to when I got this DVD. Most of all I wanted to see live concert footage. I'm a huge 311 fan but I don't go out to see live events. This DVD had enough live concert footage to please me, so I was not dissapointed with that. Second was their music videos. I don't watch MTV, and i'm sure even if I did tune into that channel I would never catch one of their videos playing. The videos were there, so I can't complain about that. Last I wanted the bonus CD. I try to collect all their music and was a big reason I liked the first Enlarged to Show Detail, because of the bonus tracks.
All the other footage they put on the DVD is what sunk the whole thing for me. The first 311 Enlarged to Show Detail had lots of band interviews that really tried to show who these guys were. This edition has lots of behind the scenes footage of the band, but it's mostly just the guys goofing around and not doing anything worth watching. The milk challenge was the dumbest thing i've ever seen. I wish they had just left that out.
I'm still a fan of 311, but this DVD just doesn't deserve more then 2 stars in my opinion.",1042502400,2,1152,4.079295154185022
1658271,5,B00005RZQ6,"Let's face it, if you're a fan, you've probably already ordered the video and decided to read the reviews as an afterthought. It's full of the unexpected, and since I haven't seen a 311 show in 3 years, it gave me a much needed 311 fix.
It's 2 hours long, and there's at least a few scenes that could have been left out, but that's what DVD is for.
The Milk Challenge: 2 Dozen guys downing a gallon of milk each as fast as possible. I didn't find this entertaining but maybe you will.
The band goes to Japan, and watching a Japanese fan that doesn't speak English sing ""Come Original"" is just amazing. The band describes them as politely obsessed. There's also footage from the old days in Omaha -- Good stuff.
Shaq is airlifted in to play a song live with the band. While he may not be the most talented artist, he is still fun to watch. And yes, he crowd surfs.
Lots of Videos and Live footage, and some great behind-the-scenes. I had to get this on VHS, but I highly recommend the DVD so you can skip the milk challenge.",1026777600,3,1023,4.251282051282051
1658272,5,B00005RZQ6,"When I ordered this DVD I didn't know what to expect. Once it arrived and I watched it I was hooked. Even my roommate (who claims that he hates 311) sat through it with me and became totally entertained by it. It has some totally hilarious moments. It features several videos including ""Beautiful Disaster"", ""Flowing"", ""Transistor"" among others, Lots of home video-style footage blended with lots of (brief)live footage, probably because the sound in many of these moments are not the highest of quality. There are a full-length live tunes which are very captivating. ""The Milk Challenge"" is the funniest thing I have seen in years. Over the course of the entire DVD you can tell that Nick and the boys (who appear shirtless quite often)are having a blast. There are short bits on each band member and we are also introduced to a miniature pinscher paired with a Full-size doberman pinscher. Also included is a bonus audio cd with some great tunes. This DVD is must for any 311 fan, passive or die-hard. Order it today!",1020988800,,1019,4.762711864406779
1658273,5,B00005RZQ6,"For all of you huge 311 fans out there and those of you just getting into the scene this is video is a must. I have seen 311 5 times now in concert and although 311 is pretty undiscribable in concert this video will give you a good idea of what its all about. You get tons of behind the scenes footage, music videos, and more. Now im a drummer and If you saw 311 on their tour this year than you were given the privalage to see the amazing drum solo featuring the whole band in ""applied science"" this was one of my favorite parts during the concert and yes.... it is included! If you have the cash buy ETSD1 as well another great video. 311 will keep rockin and so will there videos.",1009065600,,683,4.066666666666666
1658274,5,B00005RZQ6,"Well, if you like 311 you must have this one!
If you already have the first one, buy the second!

Para os fans da banda 311 eu digo: Comprem este DVD!",1008115200,,164,4.15625
1658275,5,B00005RZQ6,"Fans have been waiting for this DVD for years. It is well worth the wait. Extensive footage of each member of the band, 311-day (the fortysomething song setlist), the milk challenge (which gets kinda gross), their recording studio, and live footage of at least 4 songs. Something that really makes this DVD worthwhile, however, is the ""oldschool"" footage. There's a whole section on 311 when they first started, back in '91 or so. It shows old footage of them playing live, on the news, public access, etc. Very Cool. Another good thing about this DVD is the bonus audio CD. You would think that with all of the peer-to-peer music swapping out there, i would have all of the songs... I didn't. The first track, ""Dancehall"", was completely new to me - and it rocks. There is also a studio version of ""Bomb the Town"", which I guess was supposed to be on a soundtrack, but never made it - so far I have only heard live versions of this song. There are 2 other instrumentals, and the song called ""We Do It Like This"", which you can get free off their website. The DVD also has every video made since the first ETSD, right up through their newest, the director's cut of ""I'll Be Here Awhile"". There's also 2 different segments of making the video. All in All, over 2 hours of 311 will make any fan happy. Also pick up the first ETSD, it has an extra music video on it that the VHS version didn't!",1007769600,,1391,4.395348837209302
1658276,5,B00005RZQ6,"first off, 311 is so (...) nice! if you go to the shows, there's a good possibility that you'll get to meet them. they are so cool to their fans! the preview of estd #2 that is on the 'from chaos' album is just a hint of everything that's to come on this video. and it's a must-buy for me since i'm on it!!! hehe. no doubt if you were at a 311 show sometime in 2000 you might see yourself on it as well! buy and enjoy! peace and <3",1007251200,,431,3.7472527472527473

7952975,5,B00005RZQ6,"Pretty much as the title says this is a great DVD for any true 311 fan. I have both ETSD and ETSD2 and this one is definitely a bit better due to the length of the DVD and the professionalism. But with that being said, ETSD (the original) is also a great DVD to add to the 311 collection. It is fun to see a DVD when they were at such a great point in their music careers.",1248912000,,372,3.782051282051282

THE TRANSITION YEARS, 1997-2001

Transistor (1997)
4th Studio LP: The next phase in 311's evolution begins with this ambitious and psychedelic exploration of their unique style. This is their longest album, and it shows a substantial decrease in the rap/sing ratio. Transistor is my 4th favorite release (or 2nd fave if you count the first three LPs as one).

Soundsystem (1999)
5th Studio LP: While this follow-up to Transistor is not a huge leap forward style-wise, they still ""come original"" here. Soundsystem is really just as high quality as Transistor, which is only slightly more favored because it is longer. Soundsystem, technically my 5th favorite LP, is the last 311 album that I would describe as ""great.""

From Chaos (2001)
6th Studio LP: This is the 3rd and final album of the Transitional phase started by Transistor and continued with Soundsystem. This album is not a huge departure from Soundsystem, but to me it far inferior. Front-man Nick Hexum was suffering from a long-term relationship break-up, and it shows. This album attempts to herald the dawning of a new era for the band, but it instead accentuates the ending of their glorious initial decade. From Chaos is tied with DTOM (2005) for my least favorite 311 studio LP, but it still has a couple killer tracks, like ""Sick Tight.""

Enlarged to Show Detail #2 (2001)
A ""behind the scenes"" DVD Epilogue to the Transition Years containing interviews, music videos, concert footage, etc. - with a bonus EP of outtakes from 1999 and 2001. I actually like this well-produced DVD better than the original ETSD (96).

THE NEW SCHOOL, 2002-?
...
Live in New Orleans - 311 Day (2004)
Only four songs are missing from this epic five-hour concert (which I attended). This DVD features the live performance of 64 songs, mostly from 311's 1990-2003 releases. A handful of rare outtakes and covers were also played, including a reggae classic from Led Zeppelin.",1193356800,2,2110,4.963172804532578
7952977,4,B00005RZQ6,"I loved ETSD 1, and don't get me wrong, I like this one also, but it's just not on the same level as the first.  The editing is shotty and the cover is poorly designed.  I guess aside from technical aspects, this dvd is excellent, but those kind of things just grate on my nerves.
The single best part of the dvd? ""Do not fistfight the bears.  They are very good fighters!""",1073088000,,373,4.152777777777778

7952979,5,B00005RZQ6,"I actually bought this dvd before I had a dvd player cause I thought it was limited and a dvd lasts longer.  When I finally got a player, I was amazed.  This is to watch with friends.  This includeds live footage of full songs (unlike the first ETSD with the exception of Visit, 123, and FTBS).  It's really a great compilation of various home movies, live footage, behind the scenes & fans. It's a blast to watch when over at a friends house.  It includes footage of the rare songs Cali Soca (for a couple seconds), Psycho (featuring Shaq, this song is edited however), Outside (in the studio), I Am Superman (REM Cover), Sweet Child Of Mine (GNR Cover), and a section of old stuff from the Omaha days with songs I never even heard before.  You can also see the milk challenge (you'll have to see it), a Japaneese fan singing Come Original, DJ Master Mint (hilarious), some funny guy with really bad teeth with the band, footage about the Anti Racist Action, Fans, each band member, 311 Day 2000, Halloween shows, making the videos, KROQ Weenie Roast 2001, videos for Come Original, Flowing, Transistor, I'll Be Here A While, and more.  Also comes with a 6 song cd featuring the Soundsystem outtake Dancehall, and 5 From outtakes:  Bomb The Town, We Do It Like This, Will The World, Dreamland & I'll Be Here A While (Acoustic Version).  Get this before you get the first Enlarged To Show Detail, the first one is awesome but this puts it to shame.  This dvd seems kinda overpriced but its well worth the money.  This is a must have for all 311 fans!  Note: the bonus cd does not come with a jewel case and insert unless you buy the VHS edition.",1058918400,4,1645,4.446666666666666
