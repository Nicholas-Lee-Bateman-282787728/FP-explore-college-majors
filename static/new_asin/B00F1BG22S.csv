5962881,5,B00F1BG22S,"I first discovered Daniel Tiger's neighborhood on TV and my 2.5 year old immediately took a liking to the show.  I decided to buy the DVD for my car and now she watches it every day on her way to school.  I love that the show teaches them real life lessons in the form of a catchy, short, and easily memorized song.  My daughter and I both find ourselves singing the songs even when we aren't watching the show.  Highly recommend.",1397174400,,430,4.271604938271605

It emphasizes feelings while teaching basic life lessons to toddlers and preschoolers.

5962910,5,B00F1BG22S,"""When you have to go potty, stop and go right away. Flush and wash and be on your way.""

Several viewings of Daniel and Prince Friday learning the essentials of using the potty greatly diminished my grand-daughter's reluctance to try out that new experience.  I will add that the bed time sequence, and the idea that going to bed is actually a pleasant experience was positively received.

Other viewers of this heir to Mister Rogers will recognize his gentle and intelligent style of imparting knowledge to very young viewers.  The idea that when you are going to do something new, one talks about it first, is excellent advice for parents and grandparents of all ages.",1471564800,5,670,4.8

5962928,5,B00F1BG22S,"Outstanding DVD for my 3 1/2 year old. Episodes about going potty, getting ready for school, getting ready for bed, etc. Catchy little tunes help children remember the lessons. The other day my son and I were walking through a crowded restaurant to the restroom, and he started singing at the top of his lungs, ""When you have to go potty, stop and go right away! Flush and wash and be on your way!""  In the mornings, he sings the getting ready for school song: ""Clothes on, eat breakfast, brush teeth, put on shoes, and off to school!"" Adults who remember Mr. Rogers will enjoy this animated spinoff. Daniel Tiger is a sweet show, and the episodes deal with real issues that children experience, like reluctance to go to bed, the need to stop playing when it's time to get ready in the morning, potty training, etc. This DVD has helped some of our routines go much more smoothly and be more cheerful and fun.",1451433600,5,908,4.503030303030303

5962946,5,B00F1BG22S,"My 3-year-old daughter loves this DVD and loves singing the potty song. She asks to watch this every day and I probably let her more than I should. Daniel Tiger is done in the spirit of the great Mr. Rogers. It is gentle and compassionate with a real emphasis on basic life skills and interactions of small children. The songs and rhymes might seem too simple to adults but they are so easy to remember and to the point for kids, that I find myself singing them to her anyway. ""When we do... something new... let's talk about what we'll do"". This isn't mindless entertainment to babysit while you cook dinner. This is like a nice, gentle lesson time that will keep your child occupied and entertained, but it is even better to sit and watch with them so that you can incorporate the lessons into your daily routines - from time to potty, to brushing teeth, sharing, visiting the doctor and so much more. This is a nice quality PBS program that you won't regret sharing with your child.",1441929600,,985,4.477777777777778

In fact, he disliked pretty much all TV until we found Daniel Tiger right before his 2nd birthday. I wish they did a little more with basics like counting and shapes (MMC is great for that), but I think the target audience is a bit older as it teaches a lot of important life lessons. My 4 and 6 year olds even like it (they pretend not to) and will sing the little jingles from the show. I'm glad we found Daniel.",1439424000,4,535,4.306930693069307

The repetitive nature of the songs have really  helped my son understand and build basic daily routines. The potty episide alone is worth the purchase. My son has been using the potty ever since (and flushing and washing). This is the first potty video that has ever captured his interest. Im a licensed professional counselor who specializes in counseling children. I've seen lots of videos. By far, any Daniel Tiger episode is great. I will probably by a second one to keep in the car.",1403827200,15,586,4.634615384615385

5963018,5,B00F1BG22S,"I randomly came across a Daniel Tiger episode on PBS last fall, and we quickly fell in love with it. The oh-so-familiar theme song, characters, Trolly and ending credits song are all an echo of a parent's childhood.....good ol' Mister Roger's Neighborhood that I grew up with and loved. Each episode is full of great lessons, taught gently with fun & kindness & catchy songs, just as it was in the good ol' days. It's a show I feel good about having my son watch, we reference many of the lessons taught on the show as reminders for him when he gets frustrated about something. And he seems to understand it better from watching Daniel Tiger go through the same thing.

This DVD on Life's Lessons is wonderful, my son adores it and I do too. The potty episodes were the savior for my reluctant 4 yr old to finally give the potty a try, when I ran out of all other ideas. It also helped him understand & learn about needing to 'stop and go right away' too. The good morning/goodnight episodes are also favorites - helping him learn the routines of the day through sweet songs that we sing together and it sees to help him stick to the tasks more calmly w/o putting up a battle...not everytime, but I swear its helped. The other episodes are great too, teaching about sharing and another big one - going to the doctor.

Four-year-old Daniel Tiger invites young viewers directly into his world, giving them a kid's eye view of his life and making them feel like one of his neighbors. **(8) EPISODES INCLUDE: Prince Wednesday Goes to the Potty; Daniel Goes to the Potty; Daniel Visits School; Daniel Visits the Doctor; Daniel Shares his Tigertastic Car; Katerina Shares her Tutu; Good Morning, Daniel; and Goodnight, Daniel.",1397347200,42,1720,4.599348534201955

8611429,2,B00F1BG22S,"I watched this DVD with my 5-year-old grandson, who exclaimed when he noticed that a boy washing his hands in the potty episodes  had red nail polish on his fingernails. Then, after the episode in which Daniel Tiger shares his toy truck with his friends, there is the episode in which ""Katerina Shares Her Tutu."" It seems that Daniel sees the pink tutu as a fitting substitute for a lion's mane, which he wants to use to frame his face. He does so, and then Katerina wears the tutu to represent flower petals.

PBS seems to be furthering an agenda that should not be included in ""Life's Little Lessons"" for toddlers and young children. Such proselytization was absent from the original ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."" This new slant is a terrible distortion of the original show.",1514592000,,775,4.733333333333333
