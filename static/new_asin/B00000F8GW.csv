8545407,4,B00000F8GW,"This is a great movie to add to your personal collection because it can recapture anyones youth.  This is based on the hard-to-find cartoon that ran for several years in the mid to late 1980's.  Its main focus is on several wealthy teens trying to survive life, love, and homework, while struggling with the everyday difficulties of having it easy.  I highly recommend it because it is sure to be a big hit with anyone who enjoys animation or anyone that remembers what dreams were like when we were young.",993686400,,506,4.6
