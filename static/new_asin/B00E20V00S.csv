This is an enjoyable movie to watch as entertainment, however it has been an excellent resource to study and has been more useful than what I could get on You Tube.  (In other words, I don't feel as though I blew some money on the same thing I could get for free on the net.)  What has worked the best for me is to watch the DVD's on my computer which makes it easier to repeat bits or freeze the frame.  The DVD's come with a nice study book which contains the text of what Jocky says on the videos, however I found that I am understanding what he says better if I take my own notes - this makes me put the ideas into my own words and that process tends to show me when I don't fully understand something (which can be resolved by more study or by asking my instructor).  Anyway, the videos and sound quality are awesome and I'm finding them extremely helpful.  I don't normally write reviews and I have no connection to Jocky Sanderson at all, but I wanted to write something in this case because this is a useful safety tool and because I appreciate what he did here.",1408060800,,1229,4.142857142857143
