8352323,5,B00267S56Q,"I showed this video in two of the college U.S. history courses that I taught this past spring.  I find it historically significant and informative.  Though, undoubtedly, some will be bored by the civil exchange, Buckley, Phyllis Schlalfly, and Ann Scott succinctly express the major themes of New Right anti-feminism and second-wave feminism, respectively, in a cogent and often entertaining matter.  Not being a fan of the late Mrs. Schlalfly, I was a bit surprised that she was less vitriolic in this discussion than she was in some of her later statements.  All in all, this is a good 1970s historical time capsule that sheds light on the struggle over the Equal Rights Amendment, and i highly recommend its use to high school and college teachers as an educational tool.",1498003200,,774,4.930769230769231

8352325,4,B00267S56Q,The debate over the ERA is still occurring though not as much so this episode remains relevant.  The debate between his two guests is quite lively and the speaker advocating the ERA dismisses her opponent and her facts out of hand.,1368489600,,231,4.634146341463414
8352326,4,B00267S56Q,"You ought to pay people equally for equal work, regardless of who they are.  The only qualifier to variance is quality and quantity of whatever labor it is that needs to be executed.  The Equal Rights Amendment, at the time, was generated during the massive social changes that were taking place in the 60s and 70s, but had a long history of gestation within our nation's history.

William F. Buckley, a staunch defender of familial convention and ascent by merit, wonders what the ERA is all about, and why it's needed if there are already laws that defend a person's (read that as woman's) rights to equitable treatment under the law.  That is why is such a large legislative statement needed when within the minutiae of state constitutions, specific laws already address case specific examples of breach of social contract.

The truth is not all states had laws that would address all scenarios, and, in addition, there was a significant mindset among a certain kind of male who saw females in a different light when it came to matters of labor.  In this way the ERA was a statement to the American population, specifically to those males (and females of congruent mindsets) that women were not to be discriminated against in all matters.

The fear of the ERA was that it would open up a floodgate of operations that would chip away at the traditional family structure, to the point of rendering social chaos, or at least undesirable circumstances and conditions that made the current society operate.

Were they correct?  Well, the divorce rate, I've been told, is higher than ever before.  Children from divorced families are more abundant.  But, the nation seems to be more productive than ever before, and discrimination would seem to be at an all time low, or so that I'm aware of.  The cost of living is higher, and as for the particulars of marriage, I am not qualified to comment as I am not married.

Cations are raised by both sides, and Buckley wonders just how sharp his guests are, and raises hypotheticals as well as removing the nicety argument about items like military service.  If you're a woman who was alive in that time, or a woman who is the daughter of women involved in those efforts, then this is worth watching.",1355443200,,2240,4.724935732647815
8352327,5,B00267S56Q,"Every woman needs to watch this (if you weren't there to see it or remember it) and listen very carefully. Learn the truth about equal rights and what women's lib really did. It didn't liberate women; it only liberated men to have free sex, use and exploit women emotionally, sexually and financially.

 We know today that most of the things the feminists wanted were achieved. Many of the ""equal rights"" that the ERA would have put into law at the federal level were achieved by the 14th Amendment's ""equal protection"" clause and there was nothing stopping states from changing their laws to abolish legal sex distinctions. The term ""equal rights"" is so common and ordinary today that many of us have probably never even given it a second thought. I know for most of my life I certainly never did.

I never gave equality a second though until becoming a mother. It was only then that I really appreciated that my biology as a female gave me roles and burdens in this life- something biology does not give to a man.

Our laws and customs have always dictated different obligations and expectations upon men and women. Since women's liberation, we have come to see any different treatment based on sex as something so discriminatory we shouldn't even entertain the thought. This is because we have a deeply ingrained belief in our society that anything but complete equality would do an injustice to women. However, when studying all the laws and customs that have changed since the time of women's liberation, the ugly truth is that it is the very principle of equality that does an injustice to women, not the lack of it.

Because biology imposes burdens upon women and because we bear the physical consequences of sex (which has many times taken the very lives of women), it used to be the sole obligation of the man to provide support for his family-this included the support of his wife. The laws for receiving alimony, child support and social security benefits off of one's spouse went one way; only women could receive theses benefits from men. No matter how well off the woman was or how capable she was to provide for herself or the family, it was still the obligation of husbands and fathers to provide the support and provide for themselves.

They say women's liberation was all about choice, but the changing of state laws and Supreme Court decisions such as Orr vs. Orr made it to where men were no longer the sole party liable to support the family, mothers were no longer automatically granted custody of young children and the liberalization of divorce left society with many displaced homemakers and forced many women to have to work. Women no longer have the choice of whether or not to work because the law will force her just like a man to provide support for her family.  Before women's lib women had the choice whether or not to take paid work.

At the end of the video Schlafly makes a statement when talking about a woman losing custody of her child and being ordered to pay support that it could be a ""harbinger of things to come."" As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.",1343260800,4,3392,5.117540687160941
