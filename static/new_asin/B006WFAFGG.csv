5023978,1,B006WFAFGG,"Beautiful movies, but these DVDs come with low quality pictures and sound. No other texting than thai. The Meny is on thai.",1355788800,,123,4.636363636363637
5023979,1,B006WFAFGG,"No where in the text does this say this is an international edition. It is Thailand addition, the menu is hard to read and doesn't react like you would expect when selecting English, it jumps to another language.
It is a great story, but you should get the older version and Amazon should state in text that this is an international version. You should not have to blow up the view of the box to find it out.
This was purchased for grandchildren that they could not work through the menu and had to be returned to Thailand.",1355443200,,523,4.346938775510204
5023980,3,B006WFAFGG,"This ships from Singapore....takes forever to arrive. It is not set up in English, but you can change that on set up menu on the DVD. The ""advertisement"" before the movie starts is sketchy.",1353110400,,189,4.588235294117647
5023981,4,B006WFAFGG,would hope to see more of this Kind of movies planted in pure nature but very charming interesting and full of hope and kindness,1352592000,,128,4.375
5023982,3,B006WFAFGG,"If you look at the image of this product, you can't tell something important about this product...it's from Singapore.  Which means that much of the disc covers, labels, and packaging are in a different language.  When you play it, you get some odd and somewhat inappropriate advertisements for what appear to be Asian WWE programs?  It made me hesitate - can I show this to my kids?  They're who I bought it for.  But, apparently after the weird intro, it works well - it's in English and the sound and video line up just fine.  So far, it appears to be the movie I remember watching as a child.

What does this mean?  I'm not sure.  Maybe it's a knockoff? It didn't even cross my mind that anyone pirating would be allowed to sell through Amazon, so I just ordered it because I thought it was what I was looking for.  On the other hand, maybe the people who put it on DVD got the rights to copy and distribute it; I just don't know.  I've paid for it and, since it seems to be what I wanted (sans the weird language and advertising and packaging), I suppose I'll keep it and just set it up to watch before my kids come into the room. I suppose that's what I get for not really looking into who was selling the product and from where.

I don't care to own something from questionable origins, but I'll learn from this and move on.  My advice is to see if the original producers have this product somewhere and go that route.",1346371200,16,1425,4.272388059701493
5023983,5,B006WFAFGG,was looking for this forever. I grew up watching this. I am so happy found them can't wait to watch them,1341792000,,104,4.0

5023985,2,B006WFAFGG,"When I ordered this DVD, I thought I would be able to watch them.  Unfortunately, it came from a different country, and a different language that I cannot understand.  The packaging shown, IS NOT what I received.  VERY MISLEADING.  I am going to return it if all possible.  If not, then I've lost my money.",1395446400,,306,4.490909090909091
5023986,2,B006WFAFGG,"Intended to bring my PC on a winter backpack up to a rustic mountain cabin in the snow and then have this for the kids to watch in the evening.  To my surprise I put the DVD into the PC and discovered it was a Thai DVD with Thai as the default.  OK so tried to switch to English via DVD setup menus but they wouldn't work on PC -- so I was out of luck for the boys.  Quite disappointed I didn't realize that before heading up.  When I got home I put the DVD in normal DVD player rather than PC and was able to get English version to work and movie quality was fine.  So net disappointment is a) description on Amazon should have the Thai topic much more prominent [like in the product title line], b) DVD menus don't work on PC and c) with English not being the default.",1395100800,,770,3.9740259740259742
5023987,5,B006WFAFGG,"I purchased this for my mother as a gift, she really enjoys these kind of movies, I could not find these movies anywhere but here.  They were reasonably priced and were shipped fast, I'm glad my mother got to enjoy these and didn't have to run everywhere trying to find them.",1393632000,,275,4.392156862745098

5023989,1,B006WFAFGG,I received the 3 disc box set and the first disc is bad - very jumpy and cannot watch at all.  Would be nice if you would replace that disc with a new one at no charge to me,1390521600,,173,3.4358974358974357
5023990,5,B006WFAFGG,"The movie is wonderful with all the sequels, fun for the whole family to watch. But the movie case, commercials and subtitles are in a foreign language , but once you change setup to English , then it's a great.",1389052800,,211,4.3
5023991,3,B006WFAFGG,"From the listing I could not tell this was from another country or in a different language - the audio could be changed, although the text on the cover is not English.  Quality was ok, art on the cover was horrible. I find it hard to believe this was a legit movie sale.  Once the audio was changed to English, it was ok...kids love the movies, they don't seem to mind. It also came registered mail, I had to sign for it and it took a very long time. Will be more careful when purchasing movies from now on. The ads in the beginning are another red flag!",1388620800,,554,4.12037037037037
5023992,5,B006WFAFGG,My children grew up with these 3 movies! Was planning on buying them but I see it is NOT available?? I am upset! We lived these movies til we got our own place in the wilderness!

5023996,4,B006WFAFGG,"The movie shows family values and is free of obscenities. It has all the action, adventure, love and happy endings of a ""feel-good"" movie.
The lighting and quality is not the best since this series was made in the 70's, but it's still an enjoyable story.",1370304000,,254,4.543478260869565
5023997,5,B006WFAFGG,"Was concerned that it was from another Country, however, all you have to do is change the language to English and it is perfect.  Also, the Company that I dealt with was wonderful.  They answered all my questions and offered to take it back if I was not completely satisfied.  I was completely satisfied.",1369267200,,304,4.592592592592593

5024004,2,B006WFAFGG,"The movies are as expected but the Thai versions so everytime you watch it you have to set up the menu to English.

The reason for the 2 stars is I ordered it Dec 14 and received it Jan 4. This was a Christmas present. When I inqured as to when I could expect delivery I was informed it could be Jan 25! No applolgies for not sending it out on time. I was very disappointed.",1357430400,,374,3.9210526315789473
