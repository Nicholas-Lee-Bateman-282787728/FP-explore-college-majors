8523713,2,B0080QOL4M,"Not nearly as good as I had hoped. If you you are really into history, the low quality films may be of some interest. For example. the movie, Memphis Belle,is not the one that was done in the last 20 years, but a much older WWII propaganda version.",1424649600,,248,4.1875

8523715,3,B0080QOL4M,"The description of this movie indicated that there were several full-length movies, but when my set arrived I discovered that two discs were never recorded at all. They weren't wiped clean they were just blank and said so . What a big rip-off!",1380067200,,243,4.674418604651163
8523716,5,B0080QOL4M,"I had my doubts ordering this set because of the reviews. It not only has War Movies but must see documentaries that are worth the price alone. The True Glory, prologue by Dwight D. Eisenhower, narrated by Peter Ustinov covers all the major battles from D-Day to the falling of Berlin. A Must See if you like history. The North Star, winner of 6 Academy Awards about Ukraine farmers fighting the Nazis. Great Movie and very powerful. Memphis Belle about the legendary Memphis Belle, the flying fortress who flew 25 successful missions during its heyday. All the movies are great and there is a lot of Oscars Winners and movies that were up for Academy Awards. This is a Great Set of Movies and documentaries for the money. A must have for people adding to their collection. 5 Big Stars",1373760000,2,785,4.614285714285714
