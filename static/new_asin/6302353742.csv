453203,2,6302353742,"I debated between one and two stars for this movie, but the presence of Bela Lugosi pushed me toward two stars.  The plot is generally implausible and the dialogue is atrocious.  The movie almost would have worked better had there been no dialogue at all.

Six members of the Japanese Black Dragons received plastic surgery from Dr. Melcher (Lugosi) to enable them to replace six prominent U.S. businessmen prior to the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Once the U.S. entered the war, the six men began to sabotage various installations.  Germany loaned Dr. Melcher to the Japanese to perform the operations.  However, once the operations were completed the Japanese imprisoned Dr. Melcher.  Dr. Melcher proves you can not keep a determined Nazi down and not only escapes from prison in Japan, but he finds his way to the United States, mesmerizes people as required, and then begins to knock off the six impersonators one-by-one.

The police run about confused, until the appropriate point when they put all the facts together.  Dr. Melcher resides in the household of Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke); he manages to fool everyone into thinking that Dr. Saunders is sick when Dr. Melcher actually has been keeping Dr. Saunders hypnotized.  Naturally, niece Alice (Joan Barclay) is suspicious of Dr. Melcher's skulking and sinister looks, but until the evidence is overwhelming, female relatives in movies of this type are disbelieved.

The only high point in this movie is Lugosi.  His ability to look sinister and to stay in character in the face of awful dialogue and a plot that makes little sense is incredible.  I kept trying to make sense of this movie and finally realized that it was impossible; viewers were expected to take a lot of things on faith - so many things that eventually the plot collapses under its own weight of implausibilities.

Every movie has to have one redeeming feature, and that feature is Lugosi.  If not for Lugosi, the remaining prints of this movie could disappear and the world might be a better place.  However, Lugosi keeps this movie from being a total waste, and people who consider themselves huge fans of Lugosi should add this one to their collection.

Good Luck!",1187654400,2,2205,4.932249322493225
453204,1,6302353742,"This is one of Lugosi's poverty row movies, from the period when his career really started to go downhill (although he did make Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man later than this one). There's a series of murders and people go around trying to figure out what's going on, and it all ends up in a second world war era anti-Japanese anticlimax ending. It's quite boring, definately one of Lugosi's worst movies (although not as painful or embarrassing as ""Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla"".

Of course, Bela Lugosi fans know that no matter how bad a movie was, Lugosi's acting was always sincere. He always did a good job, and you will want to see this no matter how bad I (a fellow fan) say it is. But do yourself the favour and get it in a multi DVD set, for example the Horror Classics 50 movie pack, instead of wasting several dollars on it alone.",1151798400,4,850,4.448717948717949
453205,3,6302353742,"THE APE is a badly made and badly written film, but one which I am happy to report is actually entertaining.  It's badness makes it fun, which -- despite the existence of the phrase ""so bad it's good"" -- is actually a rare phenomenon in my experience.

To begin with, this is the first horror movie I've ever encountered that displayed the opening credits accompanied by happy, cheerful circus clown music.  Forget dark, ominous, atmospheric orchestration which can set the mood immediately.  Disregard all attempts to initially set the viewer in mind of deep hopelessness, imminent despair and slow lingering death.  Play clown music!  You're trying to scare me, but all I can think about are guys with big shiny pants jumping through rings of fire.

Anyway, the movie is about Boris Karloff as a mad scientist (he wears a white coat, has loads of test tubes and kills in the name of science), and his desperate search to find a cure for polio, the affliction which has prematurely ended the lives of his wife and daughter.  He's working feverishly to cure the paralyzed eighteen-year-old woman next door -- Frances -- who reminds him of his deceased daughter.

But there's an interruption to Karloff's work.  A big, mean, angry ape has killed its trainer and run away from the nearby circus (hence the goof-ball music in the opening credits).  This disagreeable primate is killing and maiming loads of folks in this small town, and the bodies are making they way through Karloff's lab (he's the town's doctor, even though almost everyone thinks he's a nut).  Karloff takes advantage of his good fortune by using these patients for experimentation purposes.

Soon, the ape breaks into Karloff's lab and things start getting really odd.  Karloff kills the ape in self-defense.  Then, realizing that his supply of corpses will dry up, he hollows out the body of the ape, wears it like a suit, and continues the ape's killing spree.

Now, depending on what you expect from bad movies you can either throw your hands up in complete disgust, or you can accept the movie's wonderfully goofy premise.  Personally, I dug it, precisely because it's so fundamentally hokey.  I know you don't need me to tell you this, but you simply cannot hollow out an entire ape and wear it like a Halloween costume.  I mean, okay, maybe you can, but you wouldn't look like an ape.  You'd look like a giant jackass with bits of dead ape wrapped around him.  (Forgive me for assuming the male gender in that last sentence, but I'm thinking that the whole hollowing out an ape and draping yourself in its carcass is definitely a guy thing.)

I won't discuss any more of the plot.  Partially, because I'd then be getting into spoiler territory, but mostly because the movie doesn't have any plot left.  There are just a few annoying things left that I wish to mention.

Francis' boyfriend actually dislikes the idea of his girlfriend being cured because he doesn't want her to stop being dependent on him and also because, as he says, ""I don't like things I don't understand.""

Um, wow.  I mean, I fully grok the natural suspicion one has towards new advances, but isn't the blanket rejection of all things he doesn't understand going a bit far?  (""Sorry, can't drive into town; I don't understand that fangled internal combustion engine! ... No, no email for me; I never did get the hang of binary! ... What?  A pickle?  No, I can't eat them; I never figured out how they work either."")

And I'm sure his viewpoint was a great source of comfort to any members of the audience who actually were themselves stricken by polio.  There shouldn't be a cure in the future, because there isn't a cure in the present?  Forcing people to be dependent on other people is fine?  They must have been outraged.  They'd have walked out of the movie before the end if they'd been able to walk. (Sorry.)

There are some painfully sloppy moments throughout and many of them could have been corrected so easily that it gives the impression that the filmmakers simply didn't care.  Take, for example, what is (very) arguably the film's most ludicrous scene.  Karloff has just discovered a potion which is the cure for paralysis.  He places the only drops of this previous fluid in a small, fragile test-tube.  Which he sits down flat on its side onto an ordinary tabletop in his lab.  Which then rolls off said table and smashes into tiny pieces on the floor.

As hilariously inept as this scene is (and you have to see the look on the faces of the actors to really appreciate it), it could easily have been fixed.  You see, the very next scene at the lab is a sequence where the ape breaks in and smashes most of it before being killed.  Wouldn't it have made more sense to have the ape itself smash up the test tube?  (And it would have made the desecration of the monkey's corpse a little easier to understand too.)

Also, as a complete aside, I wish to question Karloff's credentials as a physician.  During his early experiments with animals, he injects a paralyzed dog with a solution and then confidently states, ""You'll be chasing bones in the morning.""

I'm no dog expert, but dogs generally chew bones and chase cars.  If a dog is chasing a bone, then either he's A) still paralyzed or B) left his bone in the glove compartment.  (A third possibility exists, which is that the bone is still in the possession of its original owner, but I don't think this is something Karloff should be encouraging in his pets.)

The Digiview Productions version of this movie is not in good shape.  The image is mostly decent, but the picture keeps jumping and the sound cuts off.  It almost seems like three or four frames every few minutes just went completely AWOL.  This problem affects some scenes more than others.  Most of the movie is acceptable, but some passages are almost unwatchable.

Before leaving this movie, I'm going to reveal myself as a complete softy and say that the final scene between Karloff and his young patient is actually quite touching.  (Ignoring the monkey costume, of course.)  But in any event, I do recommend this as the proverbial fun, bad movie.  Boris Karloff, guys in ape costumes, stupid townsfolk -- this movie's got 'em all!",1136332800,3,6215,4.679889298892989
453206,3,6302353742,"""Black Dragons"" is a film that, as most Bela Lugosi fans know, was made for Sam Katzman and his Banner Productions, and then released by Monogram Pictures. So forget about plot; plot in a Katzman flick is only incidental to the shoddy sets, direction, and acting. The truth be told, this is one of those pictures that, if it didn't have a Lugosi, would not have been made.
OK, here's the plot . . . and don't ask me to repeat it: Seems a group of prominent American businessmen are being slain. We also know that it is Lusosi doing the slaying, because it's revealed very early on in the film as to what he's up to. Now, here's the twist. The American businessmen are really Japanese, having been trtansformed by none other than Dr. Lugosi, in this picture a Nazi Evil Scientist (Boo!) and sent here as a fifth column.
It immediately strikes our sense of logic that it would be far easier just to send over a geoup of Germans or Italians than go to all the trouble of changing a person's race. But this is a Katzman flick, so logic is the first thing a viewer leaves behind when entering. Of course Lugosi is caught (by a pre-Lone Ranger Clayton Moore), thus getting his at the end. It is amazing to me that no matter how ridiculous the plot, Lugosi remains solidly professional rather than go down the chute with the movie. One reason why I become angry when someone tries to tell me that he was a bad actor.
If this picture were set in today's age, Lugosi would do quite well as a dream-come true to Michael Jackson and Joan Rivers, among others.
The quality of the film is dark and murky - apparently no effort was made to clean things up, but you can't go wrong for the price, especially if you are a fan of the genre or Lugosi. Perhaps the film will resurface in Bela Junior's restored series of his father's films. I certainly hope so.",1045180800,20,1841,4.354651162790698

Lugosi is good, as usual. Some of the other actors are decent and some are not so good. The weakest part of the movie is the story. It's not interesting or thrilling (it's supposed to be a horror-thriller). It's just boring.

After looking at the cover, I was quite shocked to see that this actually is a factory-pressed DVD and not a DVD-R. I was even more shocked to see that the cover claims that this DVD was made in the USA. Maybe, maybe not. Don't judge a DVD by its cheap, grainy, and cartoony cover.

I am a horror fanatic and I own maybe 30 of Lugosi's movies and I can say, this is one that Bela should be proud of! Sometimes we hold people like Bela Lugosi or Boris Karloff or Harrison Ford or Anthony Hopkins to higher standards than we would other actors which might explain people's dislike of some of Bela's Poverty Row work. I'm not claiming it is Dracula or Son Of Frankenstein, but Lugosi's character is conniving, manipulative and very ambiguous. Not until the end of the movie do you really have an idea of whether he is on the Allied or Axis side of the war. Although the focus here is spies and sabotage during WW2, there are some nice horror touches. Not only do we get some horrific murders and a few creepy sets, but there is a surgery subplot similar to what you'd find in Frankenstein or Les Yeux Sans Visage. Yes, I wish I had access to a better copy because at times the film is too dark, but it's short and it never gets boring so you'll hardly notice.

453273,3,6302353742,"Boris Karloff stars as a seemingly not so mad mad Scientist who is looking for a cure for what I assume is polio. He lost his daughter and wife to it about a decade earlier, we learn, and has been feverishly trying to conquer the disease ever since. He's focusing on curing purty young thing Francis Clifford with whom he seems to have a bit of fatherly affection. Karloff is on the verge of restoring the young woman's legs, which seems like a good thing, until we learn that the key ingredient in the cure is nice, fresh human spinal fluid!

  Karloff has been murdering some of the seedier locals, whom he assumes won't be missed, draining the spinal fluid from their bodies and injecting it into Frannie Clifford. As the bodies start to pile up Johnny Law, or in this case Sherriff Halliday, is starting to sniff around Karloff, looking for the killer. As luck would have it, a savage ape escapes from a traveling carnival when the carnival accidently burns to the ground. The ape goes on a short terror spree, scaring the bejeezus out of the locals. When it smashes its way into Karloff's house Doc Boris pitches a jar of chloroform in its face, knocking it out. He then does what any sane man would do and skins the ape and then wears the pelt whenever he needs to kill for fresh spinal fluid, thus deflecting the blame off him and onto the ape, which no one else knows is dead. Ah but you can't ape an ape without the chickens, or the hot lead as it were, coming home to roost.

  Karloff does an excellent job making his character a sympathetic one. You can see how his intense grief overwhelms him and drives him to do some pretty immoral things in hopes of curing the disease that killed his daughter. After all if he loses Fran Clifford to the disease it would be like losing his daughter again, and he couldn't probably survive that. And Curt Siodmak does a good job with the scripting chores, adding a weird little triangle between Karloff, Fran and her Dudley Do-Right style boyfriend.

An investigator arrives to gather information. Uncle Bill's niece Miss Alice arrived too. A man arrives to get information, but fails. ""He was sound as a dollar."" [That's when dollars were made of silver.] What will the visitors find in Mr. Walter's hotel room? A Japanese dagger?

Van Dyke and Ryder return to Dr. Sanders, who gives advice to handle a problem. But they neutralize each other. [Neat, but not believable.] Miss Alice goes to investigate. They find nothing! A body in the cellar shows a lack of proper housekeeping. Two bodies are left on the Japanese Embassy steps. [No anti-littering laws?] Dick will go to see banker Handlin. The butler has disappeared too. Dick Martin brings Handlin back to Washington. There is a shot and the truth finally comes out. Can you believe this Grand Impersonation? [I can't.] What is the fitting reward for the good doctor? Will this Spy Ring be smashed?

The idea behind this film could have been much better with a proper script and bigger budget. It is no secret that many industrialists had fascist sympathies (kept hidden during the war). That ""Black Dragon Society"" really existed in Japan.
