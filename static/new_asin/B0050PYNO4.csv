4517308,4,B0050PYNO4,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have basically become comedic icons over the past seven years. Along with director Edgar Wright, Pegg and Frost were introduced to most Americans through both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Each of the British actors found success venturing off on their own even though Pegg seemed to have more successful outings. Pegg playing Scotty in J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot is probably what he's known best for these days, but Paul is the first time we've seen the two reunited since Hot Fuzz. Would it be worth the wait? Could Pegg and Frost make a great film without fellow UK collaborator Edgar Wright? If you're thinking of any answer other than, ""Yes,"" then you're highly mistaken.

There really is no reason not to like this film if you enjoyed Superbad or basically any film Simon Pegg or Nick Frost were a part of. The writing doesn't seem to be quite as polished as when Edgar Wright is also included in the equation, but it doesn't take anything away from the entertainment factor of the film. In fact, one of the highlights of the film is how much homage to other great sci-fi films is actually included in the film. Some reviews are saying that there was too much, but I thought it fit the overall tone of the film incredibly well. My personal favorite was the reference made to a specific James Cameron film (hint: it's not Avatar) after it's revealed who's been giving Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) orders, but Steven Spielberg's cameo is a close second.

The supporting cast is just as fantastic as the main one. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are, of course, the highlight. The ongoing gag of everyone thinking they're a gay couple somehow manages to remain humorous every time someone comes back to it. Seth Rogen was the perfect choice for Paul. While Pegg and Frost have admitted in interviews that they originally had an older actor in mind for the voice of Paul, Rogen brings the stoner humor he's become associated with to an extraterrestrial being with ease. Trying to imagine someone else in the role is nearly impossible. Kristen Wiig also steals quite a few scenes mostly due to her unique use of vulgarity. However, the scenes involving Bill Hader, Joe Lo Truglio, and Jason Bateman are just as great as the ones featuring the main cast. Bateman's Agent Zoil seems to be trying to take this assignment seriously while Haggard (Hader) and O'Reilly (Truglio) are constantly getting in his way due to them not taking their jobs seriously.

The film seemed slightly reminiscent of Pineapple Express. Other than the fact that actors in the cast of Paul were also in Pineapple Express, Pineapple Express had a lot more action in it than the trailers let on. It was almost just as much as an action film as it was a comedy. Paul is the same way, but it brings some drama into the mix as well. It's certainly a comedy first, but it doesn't take long for you to get sucked into the film's explosive action. There's actually a little bit of heart to the film as well as the drama comes into play when the fate of a few of these characters you've grown to love over the past hour and forty minutes becomes questionable.

Paul covers nearly all of its bases just in the amount of genres the film seems to cram in one film. It's a sci-fi comedy on the surface with one of its main characters being completely animated while also throwing a little bit of action, drama, and adventure in for good measure. The film seems to spend just as much time making you laugh as it does knocking you out of your chair with all of the car chases and gunfire heavy action sequences before surprising you by pulling at your heartstrings in the finale. If you enjoyed Superbad, Pineapple Express, Shaun of the Dead, or Hot Fuzz, then Paul is a must see. Paul is an adventure that'll suck you in and make you wish any of the trips you've taken through the desert were half this entertaining and hilarious.",1300406400,2,3913,4.561877667140825
4517309,4,B0050PYNO4,"As of writing, this film isn't out in Canada, however a CAM version of the UK release is out, so I am reviewing it based on the version I saw.

When it comes to Brit comedy, nobody does it quite like the Frost/Pegg duo. Both are phenomenal actors and seeing them on screen is a charm. So when I saw the trailer for ""Paul"" with The Green Hornet,, I must say I was very excited. And I must say, the film didn't disappoint. Is it quite on the same level as the Blood and Ice Cream movies? Definitely not, but it's a great piece of brain popcorn and I believe you will definitely love it.

This movie is basically the plot of E.T. with the humour of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, and it works! Of course you can't go wrong with that combination. Although Edgar Wright didn't direct the film, and the film feels very different from the mentioned two, this film actually manages to have the same level of charm and entertainment as those two. Also, the film has a wide range of good actors- including Jason Bateman, Jane Lynch, and even David Koechner!

Two British nerds, Graeme and Clive, are on a road trip across the US, which they have been dreaming of as kids. They've been dreaming of this as kids, and the highlight so far has been Comic Con San Diego. They
even have met Adam Shadowchild. One night, while in Area 51, Nevada, they witness a car crash, and come across the foul-mouthed alien slacker Paul. But this ain't no District 9 or E.T. Paul is, as mentioned above, is a slacker, and a loud/foul mouth. He is being chased by US government agents, and Graeme and Clive have no choice but
to take them with him. Along the way, they pick up a religious chick, an old lady who was wronged by Paul, and it all becomes one wacky and zany adventure.

This is definitely an adults-only version of E.T., and one that manages to entertain all the way through. Tonnes of gross moments and WTF moments as well as belly laughs and crude humour. Seth Rogen is
surprisingly great as the said alien Paul, his voice is surprisingly fitting. He was great in his past year's The Green Hornet, and he does amazingly well here. Pegg and Frost are their usual charming selves,
and manage to make a great team. But the highlight of the movie was Kristen Wiig- she was HILARIOUS!!!! Every line from her mouth was gold, and she definitely stole the show. This movie also had lots of heart too, and there is a VERY touching scene near the end I will not spoil.

Overall, this definitely is not Wright material, but if you go into it with an open mind, you will enjoy this movie like I did. Definitely recommended for sure.",1298332800,50,2606,4.3539094650205765

Considering the amount of swearing, it was rather cleverly and adorably (dare I say) done... meaning it had a purpose. It definitely did not sound like some cheap comedy just swearing to get attention. The whole story was very cute, the characters were fleshed out very well, and it was a fun ""road trip"" film all the way through. You actually cared about everyone involved. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a fun, light-hearted comedy.",1506211200,3,585,4.745098039215686

4517430,3,B0050PYNO4,"Paul had a lot of potential. It has some supremely talented people associated with it. It has some fine acting (especially by Jason Bateman and by Seth Rogen as the voice of Paul).  The script is filled with ""inside jokes"" for the hard core Sci-fi fan, but it is also highly original, very accessible for the non-fan, and absolutely hilarious.

It's only flaw was that it deliberately goes out of its' way to take a huge dump on people of faith in general, and Christians in particular; and dump it does, in droves. Its' anti-religious bias is as offensive as Judy Garland's blackface number in ""Everybody Sing"", and Mickey Rooney's role in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". It makes even non-churchgoers squirm uncomfortably in their seats.

The result is akin to the Titanic going out of its' way to deliberately ram the iceberg... multiple times. Something that was beautiful destroys itself before your very eyes. .",1504396800,,911,4.902597402597403

4517436,5,B0050PYNO4,"""Paul"" is a great film that appeals to fans of the Science Fiction, Buddy Comedy, and Stoner Comedy genres.  Made by the duo that created ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" it is the story of two British tourists Clive and Graeme who are vacationing in the United States to attend the San Diego Comic-Con and have rented an RV so that they can tour the American Southwest in order to visit the sites of classic rumored UFO activity.  Along the way, they run into a classic Grey alien named Paul who crash-landed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947 and has been kept in secret government custody ever since.  He tells the two that he has escaped but is being pursued by government agents.  Graeme and Clive agree to help Paul make his escape to a location where he can contact other members of his own race but along the way they have several humorous run-ins with locals and law enforcement officials before they eventually arrive at the rendezvous point where Paul is picked up by a ship from his planet.

Even though ""Paul"" was written by two prolific writers of great British comedy, the tone and humor is thoroughly American which succeeds as a genre mashup and even though there is mild adult language and a few scenes depicting marijuana use throughout the film, it can be enjoyed by people of any age.

The packaging is standard for all BDs and includes a UV digital copy.  A great comedy addition to your video library.",1503187200,,1423,4.53515625

Seth Rogen is the perfect choice for Pauls voice, Simon and Nick are both great again in this movie.  Simon Pegg is fast becoming one of my favorite actors, love him as Scotty in the new Star Trek movies.

The best part is Seth Rogen's performance as Paul, who is exactly how I would hope an alien hitchhiker would be. There is some mean-spirited lampooning of American red staters, which given the current political climate seems fair, and some of the jokes fall flat, but it's fun if you aren't expecting more. See it for some good natured lampooning of SciFi geeks and alien conspiracy paranoia and some mean ridicule of red necks and Christian bible literalists.",1462492800,,632,4.754545454545455

All of my other Blu Ray discs play OK so I asked for a replacement.  The second copy acted the same.  When I left the disc in and it took 2 1/2 minutes for the movie to start!  And sometimes 10 to 15 seconds for menu changes to happen.  Some web research showed that new Blu Ray discs can have features not supported by older players.

4517822,4,B0050PYNO4,"Graeme and Clive, two English nerds, travel to L.A. for Comic-Con in an R.V. Tootling down a deserted desert highway at night, a big Men-in-Black sedan passes them at high speed. All of a sudden, the car starts swerving, then shoots off the road to roll over in a spectacular crash. Our heroes stop to see if there are any survivors. Turns out there was only a driver in the car and he made it out OK. Turns out, also, that he is a little green man. Well, grayish-green. The eponymous Paul has escaped Area 51 and needs help getting back to where he can be picked up to go back home. After they get over the initial shock, Graeme and Clive are just the guys to help him. This turns into a rollicking good buddy movie, with chase scenes and a love interest and lots and lots of laughs.

Paul was released in 2011. It is 104 minutes long, with the unrated version 109 minutes.  It is rated R mostly because of the language, which is feisty to say the least.  But this is a very funny movie. Not quite as funny as Shaun of the Dead (2004), but it is up there.  Simon Pegg (Graeme) and Nick Frost (Clive) work so well together, and you just LIKE these guys - even if Clive is annoying.  Seth Rogan does a great job as the voice of Paul and the supporting actors are very good.

I have the combination set, with BluRay and DVD discs.  You can listen to the movie in English, Spanish, French, or Descriptive Video Service. Subtitles are also available in English SDH, Spanish and French.

The BluRay disc has its own Bonus Features:
A. Between the Lightning Strikes: The Making of Paul
B.  Behind the scenes featurettes
I haven't seen these.

On the DVD disc, you get a Commentary Track and 6 other bonus feaures:
A.  Commentary Track with Greg Mottola (director), Simon Pegg (plays Graeme), Nick Frost (plays Clive), Paul Hader (plays Agent Haggard) and Nira Park (producer).  When Paul is first shown, on that night in the desert, a commentator exclaims, Look at his eyes. Theyre amazing! And Mottola says, They did an incredible job. It took a good 7 months to get his eyes right.
In case you were wondering, The Big Guys office was filmed in a parking garage! And, yes, that really is Steven Spielbergs voice on the speaker phone.
B.  Bloopers (11 minutes) In particular, there were a lot of retakes when they had trouble keeping a straight face while listing Shadowchilds books  and no wonder.
C.  The Evolution of Paul (54 minutes) Commentators include Greg Mottola, David Lowry (lead  animator), Judy Johnson (visual effects supervisor), Anders JJ Beer (animation supervisor), Scott Holmes (lead animator), Eamon Butler (head of animation), Jason Horschaft (animator), Hal Couzens (visual effects producer) and Julian Foddy (CG supervisor).  This special covers the creation of the animated Paul.
Mottola says, Trying to direct an animated character is, feels kind of like giving an actor direction via twitter from the other side of the globe. You tell them something and then three months later you find out what it looks like.
D.  Simons Silly Faces (2 minutes)
E.  Who the Hell is Adam Shadowchild? (3 minutes)
F.  Galleries. Many many shots of rehearsal photos, storyboards, posters and others.

4517856,3,B0050PYNO4,"I am an unabashed fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and rate their ""Hot Fuzz"" as one of my five favorite films of all time. I have liked almost everything they have done, and while ""Paul"" has its moments, I found it to be unevenly paced. There are brilliant bits and an outstanding cast, but there are also scenes that dragged on. Frost and Pegg play a couple of sci-fi geeks on an RV tour of Area 51 and meet a CGI alien named Paul. Jason Bateman and Sigourney Weaver show up as the heavies looking for Paul and the chase is on. Paul is hyperintelligent but offensive (""He's not evil, he's just a bit rude"") and unfortunately I found Seth Rogen's vocalization to be grating after a short while. Having said that, the CGI details are very well rendered and fit quite well into the visuals of the film. The movie sets up a needless creationism versus evolution subplot that is not essential to the plot, while taking every opportunity to present Christians as uniformly bigoted, abusive, and stupid. Likewise the political swipes are placed to maximally offend conservatives (doubtless as bigoted, abusive, and stupid as Christians in the eyes of the filmmakers) with gags such as the jab at Bush 41 having autographed a photo to Sigourney Weaver ""You were the best thing I ever invaded"". I grew tired of these broad-brush characterizations quickly.

Agent Lorenzo Zoil (Bateman) steals the show along with fellow ""Arrested Development"" star Jeffrey Tambor (""One of the driest men I've ever met"") as ponderous sci-fi author and general blowhard Adam Shadowchild in a film that accelerates in the last thirty minutes to an absolutely dynamite ending. Much is very skillful here: I particularly liked the numerous references to other movies, and Sigourney Weaver's presence gives the film sci-fi gravitas it would have otherwise been lacking.

Unlike all the other Pegg and Frost films I have seen, I felt a bit let down by ""Paul"". Individual elements were comedy gold (trying pot around the campfire worked way better than I had even imagined it could) and the cast was brilliant. The needless castigation of Christians and conservatives didn't further the plot and grew tiresome, but the biggest cinematic gaffes were the uneven pacing (akin to stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of hilarity) and Seth Rogen's vocal characterization of Paul.

The DVD has numerous extras, all of which I enjoyed immensely. There are some good bloopers, galleries, an Adam Shadowchild featurette, a short about the evolution of Paul, and an excellent commentary track that I enjoyed at times more than the movie itself.",1436572800,,2607,4.920454545454546

If you're a fan of traditional Pegg and Frost adventures, this one might not work for you as much as their others.  The star of this show is Paul and the Frost/Pegg (or is that Pegg/Frost) take supporting roles.  Of the two, Fatty is kind of entertaining and he works, while Skinny is sort of annoying and he really doesn't make a good straight man.  He's also not very entertaining as a frightened guy who ""doesn't want his legs broken"".  The movie ends too predictably but overall, I think it works.  Kind of along the same lines of Galaxy Quest.",1435449600,,696,4.259541984732825

Many parts are similar with my expriences. I read tons of books about UFO, aliens, Roswell, Area51, etc when I was a kid in Beijing. When I came to USA where the legends happened, I asked many Americans I met but no one knows! The reaction of them is just like the waiter in that hotel. LOL.I also met lots of Christians who do not believe anything but the Bible. I do respect them but--------you know. I really want to tell them: You are living in a world filling with science, including internet, iphone, airplane, rocket,television,computer, etc , but you don't believe in it while you'r using it every day?! To learn more could help you understand the Bible better.",1434672000,,883,4.525

8451644,1,B0050PYNO4,"This is the first movie where I've been completely opposite the Amazon review! It's never happened before, and I was surprised at how boring, foul, and unlikeable this movie was with such a high rating. And, I'm a sci-fi junkie so I got the jokes. There were some funny moments, but it left me feeling completely discouraged about the state of the world.

I think what brought it down was this--you get the feeling that if you ever met the writers, they would turn out to be arrogant, nerdy jerks from junior high who never grew up, and are wallowing in their newfound ability to put down and bully everyone they don't like, while they put on a nice face and just complain about how bad everyone else is.

For humor, the jokes they find to be funny are people wetting their pants and making crude noises. There is so much crass humor that it's not lighthearted or cute, it's just insulting. So a word of warning, this movie relies on being demeaning, crass, foul-mouthed, and disgusting for much of its humor. And I'm not even generally bothered by that sort of thing.

A disappointment for a sci-fi lover and a sad waste of time.",1527897600,,1130,4.5024390243902435
