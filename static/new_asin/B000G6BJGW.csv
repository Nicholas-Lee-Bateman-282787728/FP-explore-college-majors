8129173,4,B000G6BJGW,"This is a great documentary on Washington State wine regions, their unique climates and terroir.  However, this is a very different, and earlier edit than the other copies I have seen.  It is the same production, and has a lot more information, but wow, what a difference a re-edit makes.  Even if you are just a student of film, this is an abject lesson how editing impacts the final result.  So, get the newer version if you want a very professional, slick travelogue and introduction to Washington wine.  Or, get the original and get the additional interviews and individual winery visits, and risk motion sickness from the jumpy, illogical, and undisciplined editing.  Or get both.",1302566400,,685,4.913043478260869
8129174,5,B000G6BJGW,"I have been a wine business professional for 30 years and I can tell you, if you are interested in learning the story of Washington State wines...this is the resource. From the cataclysmic formation of the Columbia Valley 20,000 years ago, to the complete discussion of all of the AVA's within the state, this DVD covers it all. The quality of the A/V is excellent, the scenery is beautiful and the story is told in an easy to listen and stay with format. I highly recommend this resource to all wine professionals and anyone interested in learning more about Washington State wines.",1266192000,,583,4.7254901960784315
8129175,4,B000G6BJGW,"Although the some of the soundtrack left much to be desired, especially with the initial bluegrassy poorly mixed/poorly written track where the vocalist couldn't keep up with the instruments and the last grunge rock track, I learned tons. I missed the 'goofy Washington boosterism' mentioned by another reviewer, who apparently lives in the 'wrong' WA....i.e. DC. Having just watched another wine DVD where an Old World vintner jumped viciously on a film crew guy who casually picked a grape to munch...this DVD underlies the more accessible winery atmosphere in WA. I got bored with the promotion of 'silky tannins' as I can't drink reds and missed any coverage of the lively light Rieslings I prefer.",1236038400,,702,5.113043478260869
8129176,2,B000G6BJGW,"Excruciating.  Interesting information, especially about the area's geology, is saturated with goofy Washington boosterism.  A trite pop music soundtrack, wet as Seattle, and an android narrator don't help.  Winemakers contribute some useful nuggets, but I like the wines much better than the dvd.",1177372800,,297,5.8604651162790695

We also keep a copy in each of our B&B rooms for our guests to enjoy.  Nothing we've seen highlights the Washington Wine Industry like ""Get the Dirt on Wine""!

The scenery and music really captivate the passion that is Washington wine and the information from the experts interviewed is educational and natural.

It is also nice to have a professional product be SO approachable to all without ""snooty-ness."" Like one says ""wine bridges all walks of life"" and this is true, just as this DVD bridges people at all levels of wine knowledge to why Washington is so unique in its ""terroir"" and how this reflects in the wine!

I highly recommend this DVD for any wine lover that wants to start learning or expand on their current knowledge. The credibility backing this product shows how approachable wine is in the state!

On that note, I now want some wine!! I think that this weekened I will go visit some of the wine areas and wineries I learned about :)",1160092800,2,967,4.545977011494253
