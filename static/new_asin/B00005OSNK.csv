The movie was very sad and I thought oh my god how could such a thing happen to a nice girl, then when I saw the rest of the movie I was hooked I saw this movie every chance I could. Amy Jo Jhonson did such an amazing job and her singing was so incredible. It proved that even the worst things could end up being the best things.",1074124800,9,517,3.8411214953271027
1641777,4,B00005OSNK,The music is good and the intertwined stories works.  Good show.,1040947200,,64,4.818181818181818
1641778,5,B00005OSNK,"Hey all you classic rockers, new age hippies, yuppies, Music history fans or anybody out there that wants to experience a bit of groovy history, this is an excellent and entertaining true story. It does a good job of recreating allot of the look and feel of the 60s and early 70s even though it was a ""made for TV"" movie. This is a real story about a real gifted band and a gifted young woman who experienced an all to real tragedy. If you did not know this was fact you would think it was just typical Hollywood fiction. That fact that it's real gives it a powerful appeal. You need to see and hear this. This band had potential to impact and change the direction of music in their day. They were ahead of their time in many ways. You can also get their new Reunion CD, ""Live at Last"" and other CDs here on Amazom.com. They are the perfect companions to this movie. If you are a fan of the 60s and early 70s, if you are a music history buff or just want to experience some escapist entertainment with a true edge to it then check this movie out. It is really cool. Enjoy!!!",1021248000,5,1074,4.168269230769231
1641779,3,B00005OSNK,"That's why I think this movie didn't really do it for me. I saw the original Sweetwater in concert and was swept away by the total experience (and no, I wasn't stoned!). I found the story interesting and tragic, but sadly, I couldn't get past the wigs and so-so acting. The movie's attempt to recreate the real Sweetwater's look and sound came out smelling like bubblegum, and Sweetwater was NOT bubblegum.
I'm glad they made this movie, though. I had always wondered what happened to them. I was surprised to find out how young Nansi was, and what happened to her amazing voice. It saddened me that her attempt at a comeback was unintentionally sabotaged by...producers who didn't have a clue what they were doing. She had so much heart and guts, and to have the record label go belly up after she cut that misguided album is the kind of nightmare that WOULD send a nice kid into hiding. I'm so proud of her for digging herself out of her grave and going on as an educator. She is undoubtedly one of the gutsiest people out there.",1014249600,4,1031,4.48936170212766
1641780,5,B00005OSNK,"I saw this movie on MuchMoreMusic, and originally only watched it because of Amy Jo Johnson, the Pink Power Ranger.  But as I watched the movie, I became enthralled, not only with Amy Jo's incredible voice, but with the music itself, and the story that went with it.  As a singer and performer, I can only say that what happened to Nancy was every singer's worst nightmare.  Amy Jo played the part to perfection, as she does with all of her roles, and is a truly beautiful performer.  Anyone not familiar with either this movie or the original Sweetwater band should really check both out.  You won't be disappointed!",1009324800,5,617,4.623853211009174
7949057,4,B00005OSNK,"In this well told production, Amy Jo Johnson does a convincing job of portraying Sweetwater's lead singer, Nanci Nevins. Those familiar with 60's music and/or Woodstock already know the story of the group Sweetwater. This made-for-TV has a smart script, above average production value, a good cast, and is ample with examples of Sweetwater's music. Kudos to whoever decided to cast Michelle Phillips as an older Nevins. Many bio-pics, especially those made for TV, often suffer from inadequate budgets and ""cheesy"" acting, but this VH-1 production gets it right.",1497052800,,562,5.325842696629214

7949060,5,B00005OSNK,"Docudrama. Saw this on VH1 only once. Glad I found it online. Very well put together, the history of what happened to the first band that played at Woodstock.",1422576000,,158,4.482758620689655
7949061,5,B00005OSNK,"Great Movie.....
  Waiting for this to be released on DVD! It's about time don't you think???!!!
Both my wife & I watched this movie numerous times when it aired on TV. Fabulous songs and a great biography of how the group got together with Nevins...Anyone who remembers Woodstock should own this MOVIE....such a shame the group had such a shortcoming, this is a band that was headed to be something special! Enough with the VHS...get this title out on DVD where it rightfully belongs! This MOVIE prompted me to purchase the group's CD's. Rhino-Handmade had a GREAT compilation of the Bands material...(way back when), if you can find it...well worth the purchase!",1409011200,,664,4.919642857142857
7949062,5,B00005OSNK,Great movie! Saw it when it came out on VH1 I think! Bought the VHS as soon as it came out. Sure wish it was available on DVD as my VHS copy is starting to fade as is my old VCR! What a great voice she has!,1349222400,,206,3.404255319148936
7949063,5,B00005OSNK,"I remember when this movie came out on VH1...I watched it all the time. I am SO glad that I found it to have in my possession. I really enjoyed the story, the music, and the message. I feel like I was born in the wrong era & this movie just makes me feel like I'm there. I really like all of the characters and think the acting is good- ESPECIALLY Amy Jo Johnson...GREAT actress & AMAZING singer!!!",1337731200,3,398,4.115384615384615
7949064,5,B00005OSNK,"Since the second grade I have been completely obsessed with this band, and it really i tragic to me that I was born in wrong decade. I loved his movie because it made me feel like I could have ossibly been there, and I'm so glad it came to be, because no I know has ever even heard of Sweetwater, or Nansior any of them, even though they were the first at the furst Woodstock. What an amazing experience that must have been, and I'm so glad this movie tries to give people a glimpse as to what happened to the incredible band. I wish everything would have worked out for Nansi, I saw a video she had made more recently and she still sings amazingly.
Watch this movie, even though I agree, it is hard to recreate the truth without some iffy acting, but Amy Jo Johnson is wonderful and this movie will definitely take you back.",1220659200,2,825,4.227848101265823
7949065,5,B00005OSNK,"For people who think everyone was out of it during the late sixties. Don't be fooled,this tape reveals one of the least known musicans that were light-years ahead in fusion music. Recreation of this little known band was more than fatefully reproduced in tale of a great group that should have remembered as one of the best groups at woodstock (1969).A must buy for the music lover.",1086307200,12,382,4.7164179104477615
