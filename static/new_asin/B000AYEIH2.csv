2398047,2,B000AYEIH2,"I bought this movie because I just absolutely fell in love with Christian Payton after seeing him in ""The Temptations."" I wanted to see more of him but this movie was very disappointing. The script was poorly written and the movie had no direction. It was just aimless and went nowhere. I kept waiting for it to get better but it just didn't. It's been described as being 'funny' but I don't recall laughing at all. And what a horrible ending! This movie just didn't make any sense. A young woman (Marilyn) wants to leave town to add some zest to her lackluster life but changes her mind after meeting Rodney (Christian Payton). They hit it off, start kicking it, then he has sex with his ex-wife for no reason, they break up, get back together, have some reconciliation sex, and she ends up leaving anyway. In the make-up sex scene Marilyn said, during the thrusts of passion, that she would not leave town and that she would stay. Next thing you know she's getting on a plane. Whack.

I gave it 2 stars because Christian Payton is so fine and he did a good job acting. The Marilyn character could not act. None of the other actors moved me actually. Marilyn's mother couldn't act, her friend Lena's acting was okay but she had to roll her neck every time she said something. And the sex scenes were just awful. Who doesn't like to paint right before making love? I know that always gets me in the mood. And how many adults do you know who still have sex in the basement while their mom is upstairs? Get a room.

And the dialogue was just terrible. Words of wisdom were tossed out at inappropriate times, some of the conversations were too deep for two people who just met. Someone would say something with meaning, then next thing you know here comes somebody with something stupid to say. For every good statement made, there were 2 stupid ones that followed. The movie had a few moments but it's not worth purchasing. Rent it first then decide whether you want to add it to your collection or not.

I hope Christian will be offered better roles in the future. He is an excellent actor and it was embarrassing to see his talents wasted on this garbage. I still love Christian and I hope to see him in a good movie next time. I also hope he'll get another role that showcases his vocals because he can sing. That's his voice on ""Oh, Mother"" and ""For Once In My Life"" in ""The Temptations."" It's okay Christian. Some of the best ones have made some stinkers. Even Jamie Foxx did ""Booty Call"" and look at what he accomplished! There's hope! Still a Christian Payton fan...",1164240000,8,2571,4.4543524416135885
2398048,2,B000AYEIH2,I was not impressed with the pace of this film. At the end i was left wanting more.  The main character meets a guy she likes but in the end he does not seem to be the one for her....she goes on a seach to do more self exploration.  The scenes with her friend and mother went by and there was some film lacking.,1163980800,,311,3.84375
2398049,4,B000AYEIH2,"Finally, a thoughtful feature-film portrayal of characters who have ambitions, hopes, desires -- and happen to be African American!  This character-focused film will appeal to those who prefer  indie productions to plot-driven Hollywood blockbusters and trite rom-coms.  It deals with slow revelations of character and interpersonal complexities.

As the lead female, Marie-Francoise Theodore turns in a nuanced performance as a painter struggling to balance her artistic ambitions and emotional needs.  She and the men in her life confront the stereotyping -- divas, mammies, strong & silent --that stifle honest relationships.  ""Strange as Angels"" is a welcome relief from films that cater to the UPN-TV view of black womanhood as either as high maintenance divas or ho's, and of self-absorbed or immature men.  If you liked recent character-focused films like ""Lost in Translation,""  or ""Sideways,""  this is your speed.",1147478400,9,922,5.6231884057971016
2398050,4,B000AYEIH2,"I think it is important that we support all kinds of black films and not just those that tell the same story in the same way over and over again.  I actually think that this film would do well with audiences that aren't black because of the way they told the story.

I thought that the movie was good.  It offered a different perspective on black filmmaking and didn't follow the typical pattern of most romantic comedies with an all black cast.  It was almost like a foreign film because sometimes it was ""slow"" but that gave you a chance to really observe and get into the characters.  This film is nothing like ""Waiting to Exhale"" or ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" which, to me, were trite and don't reflect life as it is really lived.

As far as the acting, it is good.  To me, the characters were like people that I really know even though the dialogue can be a bit philosophical, which to me is ok because black folk are usually just dancing, going to church or joking around in movies.  The lead female character gives people a chance to see another side of black women, which is cool with me.

It was also good to see black sexuality on screen in such a straightforward manner.

Overall, even though the film has flaws, I enjoyed it and think that others will too.",1139875200,11,1274,4.360169491525424
2398051,4,B000AYEIH2,"As the director of this film, I must state that I find it disappointing that the first two individuals who viewed the movie and decided to leave feedback did not like it.  I do realize however, that there are some individuals that the film will not speak to.

If you are considering buying or renting this film, I implore you to make up your own mind and don't base your decision to see it on what my views may be, nor the views of anyone else who's opinion you have no reason to trust.

This film has a strong, central female character that expresses her need to be independent in an introverted, intelligent and serious manner which leads her to question whether it is irresponsible to enter into a romantic relationship.  It is my hope that I've created an atypical African American female character (compared to traditional and contemporary characterizations of African American females in movies) that many women will identify with on some level.

So, give the film a chance and let me know your thoughts.  I gave the film four out of five stars because it is not a perfect movie but I think it is very good and works on many levels.  It is romantic, sexy and at times funny.  The acting, music and cinematography are very good as well.  If you like the film, please spread the word to others whom you think would like it too.

The more positive feedback, the better the chance of having films that express diverse portrayals and ideas.

2398052,3,B000AYEIH2,"I rented this movie last night and I just love Christian Payton and Inny Clemons in this movie. I do agree with the first reviewer when it came to the two main characters Rodney and Marilyn, their wasn't any chemistry between them. I like the storyline but I disagree with Marilyn character being independent. She had the means to be independent but the lack of a good man was keeping her from it. Marilyn's friend Lena was sassy and likeable. The end of this movie was unsatisfying.",1131926400,4,483,4.563218390804598
2398053,2,B000AYEIH2,"WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE IT SEEMED LIKE THE ACTORS WAS WORKING WITHOUT A SCRIPT. IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE WINGING IT. THE MOVIE WAS STUPID, THE ACTORS LACK EMOTION AND THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS HAD NO CHEMISTRY TOGETHER. THE MAIN CHARACTER MARILYN EITHER COMPLAIN, WHINED OR BORED YOU TO DEATH. THE OTHER MAIN CHARACTER, RODNEY WAS JUST AS UNINTEREST AND BORING. THE SEX SCENE BETWEEN THE TWO WITH THE PAINT JUST TURNED ME OFF. IT SEEMED LIKE SHE REALLY DIDN'T WANT HIM TO TOUCH HER DURING THIS SCENE SO SHE STARTED PAINTING INSTEAD. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE, RENT IT! OR YOU CAN HAVE MINE!",1131753600,5,582,4.605769230769231

8080873,5,B000AYEIH2,"I just recently watched this movie and I can honestly say I loved it. I stumbled across it because I am a big Christian Payton fan, so it was a must watch, but the story itself drew me into it. It is refreshing to see African Americans portrayed in a different light, different then main stream film making. If you let it, this movie can open your mind and soul to other possibilities, while reflecting the struggle some women have defining themselves and their romantic elements. I found a lot of myself inside the main character, its hard to let go and love. So, wonderful movie and it was a totally plus to see Christian without a shirt on.",1411430400,,643,4.411764705882353

8080877,3,B000AYEIH2,"I will admit I purchased the film because I wanted to see more of Christian Payton.  It took me two viewings to really appreciate the movie.  As an African- American woman, I identifed with the Marilyn character's frustration and disappointment with failed relationships and needing to look within to find wholeness and completeness.  I thought the story did an excellent job of sending a message about self-love and setting boundaries in relationships via the Lena character. It was  easy to overlook the messages because the focus was on the main characters, Marilyn and Rodney.  Where the movie falls short is that it does not give much depth to the Rodney character.  There were many opportunities to do so.  More dialogue between the two main characters was needed, especially after the scene with his ex-wife.  I believe his mixed feelings towards his ex-wife speaks to his emotional investment in the relationship which does not necessarily end because the other person breaks the vows.  It is a process that takes time.  I think it speaks well of him, not the opposite.  More dialogue with the ex-wife was needed to understand that relationship.  I thought all the actors did a fine job acting.  A little more investment in props would have helped.  Overall the movie was enjoyable.  And yes, it was good to see Christian Payton in another major role outside of the Temptation movie and To Sir With Love 2.  I do not understand why I do not see him in more movies.  Perhaps it is his choice.  I hope so.",1314921600,,1511,4.768339768339768
8080878,5,B000AYEIH2,After reading the director's review I must state my opinion.  I feel this movie is for people who are creative and open minded.  Most people can't see past what they normally see every day. This movie does not have the basic everyday romantic story line. I feel this movie is very deep and it makes you think about love and life on another level. I look at it as a personal diary of love and heartbreak unfolding before your eyes.  It tells a really good story filled with emotion.  I am very glad that I purchased this movie.  I feel I am a very creative and artistic person so I can appreciate a movie like this.  I think it is something you have to see more than once to really understand and grasp the nature behind the character.  I think you should give this movie a chance.  I really enjoyed it!,1184889600,5,802,4.264900662251655
8080879,2,B000AYEIH2,This movie was annoyingly slow moving...The plot did not seem well developed...The acting gets a 2.5 on a scale of 1-5...I don't feel it is worth buying or watching. The description of the movie sounded good but just doesnt materialize on screen...Nice try...,1170547200,,259,5.046511627906977
8080880,2,B000AYEIH2,"i saw this movie late last week,&i liked the creative element of the chick who is the painter,but the film ventures quickly all over the place without having a central theme. I don't  feel the writing or the overall direction fully developed the characters in this film. it was interesting,but it quickly lost what steam it had after a while. this film should have been better with the ideas&concepts that the film was aiming to go for.",1165104000,4,436,4.662337662337662
