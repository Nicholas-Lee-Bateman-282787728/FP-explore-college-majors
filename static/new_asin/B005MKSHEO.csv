8479427,4,B005MKSHEO,"The reason one commentato/reviewerr makes that this  is a pity that this was filmed with a Camcorder is , I don't think accurate. I bought this Item in the Nineties when in the USA and it was then sold as 2 VIDEO TAPES and to my knowledge has never been released as a DVD by the same Company , so in all probablity this DVD is a Transferred and re mastered Version of those Original Video Tapes. My Tapes by the way were/are  in PAL , the Firm produced them originally in Both Pal & NTSC. Maybe this explains things ? I still have the Tapes and great they are too, In my Version it stretches to well over 4 Hours.",1470096000,,613,4.0578512396694215
