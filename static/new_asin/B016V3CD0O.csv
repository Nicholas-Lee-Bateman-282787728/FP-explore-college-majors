7480252,5,B016V3CD0O,"I have to admit, I usually don't care for Jake and the Neverland pirates, and only half pay attention when it is on and my son is watching it. This 45 minute feature showcases Jakes rise to Captain Jake and introduces a new villain, Lord Fathom. I have to say, I got a kick out of Lord Fathom...as corny as his lines were.",1452038400,,322,4.126984126984127

7480261,5,B016V3CD0O,"Gotta love the awesome musical stylings of Sharky and Bones! My kid loves this video. Borrowed it from the library and now we have to buy it for ourselves. It's necessary.

This DVD comes with a foam 3D puzzle. It's pretty flimsy, so don't let you 4 yr old do it alone. I used hot glue to keep it together. Otherwise it will come apart after a minute of use. This was a nice little bonus. Kids love it!",1458086400,,402,4.0886075949367084
