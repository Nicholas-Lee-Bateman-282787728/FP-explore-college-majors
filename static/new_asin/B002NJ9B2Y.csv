I have been waiting for years to find English subtitled copies of the top-notch TATORT series from Germany. I happened upon this series when it was shown as part of International Mysteries, hosted by @MichaelJecks. The series will begin running again on @MHzChoice in the fall of 2016. I enjoy seeing mysteries and police procedurals from other countries. I was delighted to find this series of mysteries from Germany. Topical, engrossing, taut with suspense and genuinely engaging, these cases will satisfy any fan of the genre. The detectives, Max Ballauf (Klaus J. Behrendt) and Freddy Schenk (Dietmar B&auml;r), work in Cologne. There are other sets of detectives for other German cities that I look forward to seeing. This series is extremely successful and long-running in Germany. I hope Amazon increases access to international TV and movies.",1467590400,13,868,5.207142857142857
