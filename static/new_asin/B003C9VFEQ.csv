8624322,5,B003C9VFEQ,"If you've ever seen the brief viral video inexplicably titled ""Dramatic Maki"", you may have wondered what that bizarre Gollum-like creature with the immense round eyes could possibly be.  TARSIER: THE LITTLEST ALIEN satisfies your curiosity with an unforgettable glimpse into the life of that rare, enchanting, and severely endangered little primate in one of its most beautiful habitats -- the tropical island of Bohol in the Philippines.  This New Zealand-sponsored documentary focuses on the work of Carlito Pizarras -- a Bohol Islander whose lifelong fascination with Tarsiers led him to help the Philippine Tarsier Foundation set up a conservation program for these charismatic prosimians -- and Dr. Irene Neri-Arboleda, a researcher devoted to studying Tarsiers and educating others about them.  The photography in this documentary is nothing short of stunning, from the lush otherworldly vistas of Bohol Island to incredible nocturnal closeups of Tarsiers hunting, eating, mating, and (in one brief but disturbing segment) killing a baby of its own species to bring the baby's mother back into estrus.  An added bonus is footage of a powerfully choreographed modern dance created by Bohol Islanders to honor their most celebrated native mammal.  At this writing, TARSIER: THE LITTLEST ALIEN is not available anywhere else online (not even on Netflix); so if you love rare and beautiful mammals, are concerned about endangered species and habitat loss, or just long for a breathtaking visual journey into a fascinating corner of the natural world, do not miss this wonderful documentary!",1347667200,2,1593,5.433198380566802
