1180254,4,B000003KCU,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and it has stuck with me for years.....it touched a part in my imagination. I think all kids feel a little like the boys, if you wish hard enough anything can happen. Great  effects, music, and fun!",946857600,2,239,4.195652173913044
1180255,5,B000003KCU,"I saw this movie when i was young and ever since i could not get it outta my head. Its one of those movies that you HAVE TO OWN! I guess the reason for my attraction to it was the ""out there"" feel to it. You know  when your young, this movie made me feel like i could go do what the kids  in the movie did. Its just that good....GET IT!!!!",939513600,4,339,3.6944444444444446

1180280,5,B000003KCU,"This is a fun movie to watch.  I am very glad that I was able to obtain a copy for myself.  The story line is plausible, but I wonder about the helicopter pilot (Sheriff's deputy) and his younger experience.  That wasn't explored very deeply, and maybe it doesn't need to be.",1495238400,,275,4.352941176470588
1180281,5,B000003KCU,Classic with lots of trippy- not necessarily kid oriented imagery.,1493769600,,66,5.7

1180289,1,B000003KCU,The captions are out of sync about 10 minutes into the movie and we cannot get them synced again with restarting or anything. I am deaf and rely on captions. Whatever Amazon did in converting the movie to digital streaming dropped the balll on transferring the captions properly!!,1487894400,,280,4.854166666666667
1180290,4,B000003KCU,"A nostalgic film for me.  I'm generally annoyed with the Hollywood trend of making computers seem like they're magical, but if you suspend reality like a 10 year old might, this is a fun movie, and from a cosmology stand-point, does some subtle things in a scientifically accurate way.  Probably no fun for a grown-up to watch for the first time, but I still enjoy watching again.",1487462400,,380,4.656716417910448

1180309,1,B000003KCU,"Complete waste of time and space for this incredibly lame story...no wonder no one's ever heard of this movie. When the kids *finally* meet the aliens the scene drags on and on and on and on with mindless abandon...I ended up fast forwarding through it since it was pointless. Interesting that the trivia for this movie says the producer decided to ""finish"" the movie at whatever they had filmed up to that point...and I believe it.",1486425600,,432,4.697368421052632

1180312,4,B000003KCU,Perfect for kids with an adventurous mind and a sci-fi nature!  I watched this movie when I was in 3rd grade when it first came out on VHS (yes I'm old!)  and it has remained one of my favorites through time.  Yes it's cheesy.  Yes it's corny.  Yes it will make you laugh.,1486252800,,272,4.056603773584905

1180330,5,B000003KCU,"A movie that allowed my imagination to think beyond, I turned this on for my children hopping to take their minds away from video games and the tablet for just a few hours. My children were amazed and not only did the enjoy the move but spent the rest of the day building a fort and their own rocket ship.",1485907200,,305,4.1

1180338,5,B000003KCU,"My 6 year old, space obsessed, grandson loved it. His 8 year old sister thought she wouldn't like it but soon changed her mind. The pace of the movie is good, it keeps moving but not so fast that you can't explain what just happened. Few modern kids know what a drive-in movie theater is for example and there is a scene where the ""explorers"" use their ""space pod"" to watch one.  The tech is a little dated but the storyline is fun and acceptable for children.",1485734400,,460,4.287356321839081

1180394,3,B000003KCU,"Overall this is an enjoyable family movie if you are into Sci-fi. The first half of the movie is exciting but gets little boring as it unfolds. The ending could have been better. But given the fact that this movie was made 1980's it is pretty darn good. If you love this type of movies then you will find that Stranger Things (Netflix Series) more enjoyable.

1180548,4,B000003KCU,"It was through an internet movie reviewer called The Nostalgia Critic that I first discovered this film, as he cited it as one of his top most underrated movies of all time. And after hearing what the basic plot of it was, it got me both interested and excited to check it out. So I made the time to search for it on Netflix and see if his review lived up to the hype.

In the end, it left me very divided. There's certain elements that are very impressive and thought provoking, and others that are downright silly. But more on that in a moment.

A young boy named Ben experiences vivid dreams about flying through clouds and over a vast, city-like circuit board, usually after falling asleep watching old sci-fi movies. After drawing the various signs he envisioned, he gives the sketches to his friend, Wolfgang; a child prodigy. Both boys also strike up a friendship with a punkish, but likeable kid named Darren. Using the circuit board dreams as a guide, and with their talents for finding scrap parts, their ingenuity, and their boundless curiosity and imagination, the trio manages to not only invent a forcefield, but build a working spaceship out of a tilt-a-whirl ride. They then take off to explore the galaxy in search of whoever or whatever was trying to contact them....and what they ultimately find is more than surprising.

Let's get the positive out of the way first. Both Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix made their film debuts here, and they both do an excellent job of playing an optimistic adventurer and a nerdy intellectual very well. In fact, all the kids in this give amazing performances; their dialogue and reactions sounding completely natural and unforced. All three boys have their various issues to deal with, whether it's bullies at school or trouble at home, and it's through their friendship and adventure that they learn how to overcome their problems.

The special effects also deserve a mention. At a time when CGI was still in its infancy, and most effects had to be done for real with wires and puppetry, the imagery throughout the film still holds up, even today.  And the soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith just adds to the wonder and enchantment of trying to reach the stars.

The downside is that the plot itself is rather choppy in places. Most reviewers (me included) tend to agree that the first half of the movie is the best and better half, with the boys slowly unraveling the mystery of the signs in their dreams and building the spacecraft. The film manages to take a silly concept and make it plausible to kids, while also posing some deeper questions about our place in the universe and what we'll ultimately do if we ever DO make contact with alien life forms. More than a few times, Ben reminds his friends (and the audience) that the aliens are probably just like us, and think we're just as weird as we think they are, and to treat them with respect. This respect for other cultures is a lesson I can totally get behind.

And I don't think I'm spoiling too much when I say that yes; the boys DO eventually make contact with aliens....and THAT is where the film starts to go a bit downhill. Granted, there's an extended sequence where they explore the spaceship, which is pretty impressive, but when they finally DO figure out just what exactly is going on...I won't lie; it's a bit of a letdown. It's not like the twist doesn't make sense, it's just...after such incredible suspense and build up, the big reveal just doesn't live up to the hype. As kid movies go, it's nothing terrible, but it's still such a weird turn to take for a concept that was, up until that point, being taken so seriously.

There's a few other plot elements that seem to come and go whenever it's convenient. Ben has a huge crush on a girl who ultimately contributes nothing to the plot until the last minute of the movie. There's also a small subplot about a helicopter pilot who starts having the same dreams, and at first, it looks like he's going to play an integral part to the story...only for his character to completely disappear once the boys leave the planet. As I later learned, apparently, the writers and director of the film originally had a ton of extra material planned and/or filmed that, for whatever reason, was left on the cutting room floor. Supposedly, an entire subplot about the boys' families was thrown out, and I can't help but think that this is the reason for the movie's choppiness. It's a shame, as I have no doubt that if such material were left in, we might've had a more successful and well known film on par with ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T.""

None the less, I have to judge by what I got, and as it stands, it's okay. It's one of those movies where one element was done so incredibly well, the rest of the film suffers a bit in comparison. I'd actually give this 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon doesn't give half stars, I've rounded it to four, as I DID very much enjoy the ride. This is a great film to watch if you're a lover of sci-fi, especially classic/old sci-fi (I was geeking out upon seeing the clips of ""War of the Worlds"", ""This Island Earth"", ""Forbidden Planet"", ""Day the Earth Stood Still"", and many others). The ending is a bit of a letdown, but the thought provoking first half more than makes up for it. Give it a watch, and see for yourself.",1440979200,,5317,4.559162303664921

EXPLORERS: Sci-fi addict Ben (Hawke), electronic genius Wolfgang (Phoenix) and tough, poverty-stricken Darren (Presson) are an unlikely trio of junior high school friends, drawn together because they are outsiders. One night Ben dreams a circuit board; when Wolf builds it, a powerful force field shoots from his computer. They refine the field into an inertialess bubble, raid a junkyard for parts, and cobble together an unsightly flying machine. Things get strange on their fun-filled test flight, and stranger still when they all dream the same dream showing them how they can use the rig to travel to space. Its as if they're being calledand what kid could resist an invitation to come out and play? After all, kids will be kidsno matter where in the galaxy they come from.

Discussion: Call it Close Encounters for Kids. Its a throwback to the Disney fantasy flicks of the 60s, with a bit of TRON tossed in for color. The special effects might not be up to todays digital ideals, but they're seamless, occasionally impressive and fill the film, keeping it visually interesting. And just because the ending doesnt fit doesnt invalidate the entire film. While the ending ignores the movies earlier sense of wonder, it is pretty funny, as goofy as a cartoonand does finally end sweet and upbeat.",1423094400,,1553,4.812734082397004

1180725,2,B000003KCU,"Encouraged by good reviews I bought this 1985 SF kid movie for my 13 years old daughter and we watched it together - and we were both TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED! Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

The film begins with a teen age boy named Ben (young Ethan Hawke) having strange dreams about some kind of alien machinery. Using those visions his genius friend Wolfgang (young River Phoenix) builds a revolutionary contraption, which will allow them to travel in space... A third boy, a tough little fellow named Darren (Jason Presson), whom they recently befriended, will also come with them...

Now, this film is not entirely without merit and in fact the first 30 minutes are actually quite good. The friendship of three guys is shown in a very discreet and yet surprisingly touching way. Darren is a particularly well thought and likeable character. Ben's crush on Lori (young Amanda Peterson), is treated with lots of charm. In Wolfgang's basement/secret lab there is a speaking (well, kind of speaking) mouse which provides some good humour, especially when playing a cat and mouse game (sorry, I couldn't resist) with family's fat bandit of cat...))) And finally the ""spaceship"" in which the three explorers go to space is a real splendor...)))

That being said this first part of the film has already some weaknesses, of which the greatest is Wolfgang's family. They are really TOO weird, especially his father (James Cromwell), who seems in fact to be mentally handicapped and is a rather unpleasant fellow - it is in fact somehow difficult and disturbing to watch scenes with him...

But it is at the moment when they actually go to space that this film declines sharply and when they (WARNING: SPOILER ALERT) actually meet the aliens, well, I could see in my daughter's eyes that this film died. INSTANTLY! And honestly I FULLY share her feelings! Aliens are ridiculous and somehow disgusting, they act insanely and babble nonsense, and the worse thing is that the whole idea of travel and adventure is revealed to have been a huge misunderstanding. To say long things short - beginning in the middle this film becomes unwatchable.

At the end my daughter, who actually is really good public (it must be the first film in years she disliked) just stood up and said: ""OK, Dad, next time please pick up something better"" and left the room... which is a very uncommon occurrence indeed... And just to be more precise, she actually is very much into SF films - we watched and both liked ""Space Camp"" just couple of days earlier...

This film could have been much better with more attention paid to the scenario - and it would not cost one dollar more to improve it! It was never good to begin with and it also aged a lot. I am really sorry that I bought it and I already gave it away for a charity sale. AVOID!",1412035200,,2827,4.724137931034483

Of course now we know that these actors have sticking power and mostly good movies on their collective resumes, but this was the debut movie for River Phoenix, for instance, and his characterization of a geeky German boy-scientist is major glue that holds this story together.

(-1 star)... the went into outer space only to encounter a bunch of cartoon-like corny characters. I anticipated the outer-space journey but with an encounter that wouldn't be so silly!

1180770,4,B000003KCU,"Growing up as I did in the late 1970s-early 1980s, I was awfully fortunate - being already a science fiction-fantasy geek - in the films that were starting to dominate the multiplexes at the time.  I suppose a lot of these efforts, from ""Labyrinth"" and ""The Neverending Story"" to ""Wargames"" and ""The Philadelphia Experiment"" look a bit cheesy to younger folks today, and there's no question that they didn't have the giant budgets (even when adjusting for inflation) or attention lavished on them that today's superhero & sci-fi films do - but given that geek-genre stories weren't automatic hits, they also I think tried a bit harder.  I saw most of the big ones as a kid or young adult, but one that passed me by for some reason when new was this strange mix of Disneyesque adventure and somewhat adult satire from director Joe Dante. It starts out very much along the lines of ""E.T."" or ""Goonies"" in the sense that it's about a group of adolescents who, without any real help from (and only minor hindrance from) adults go on a wild fantastic adventure. In this case, it's three boys - solemn German-American computer genius River Phoenix, picked-on sci-fi geek Ethan Hawke, and poverty-stricken outside Bobby Fite - who stumble on the secret to creating a bubble of force, which they find out they can expand to a globe large enough to encapsulate them, and cause to move through space whichever way they want to.

It's all rather silly, but played for the most part straightforward - until the boys are drawn to a giant spaceship out...somewhere...and run into a couple of very strange aliens, who have been monitoring earth for years and absorbing our culture. Here the film turns from adventure to satire, and I'd have to guess that this fairly sudden change of mood is part of the reason that Explorers wasn't a mega-hit (though it didn't do all that poorly). Director Dante gets to indulge in one of his favorite pastimes - simultaneously mocking and celebrating American culture, particularly the era (the 1950s) he grew up in, and the film gets to say some rather interesting things about what we value in our society, and whether we're actually going forward. It's a bit muddled at times, and the humor just a bit over-the-top for my taste, but the production design of the aliens (sure they're rubbery & kind of fakey - but that's the point isn't it?) and their ship is great, the three young stars are terrific, and Jerry Goldsmith contributes his usual ""stellar"" music. Why'd I miss this in 1985?

The DVD is just fine - pretty bare-bones, which is to be expected for a lower-tier nostalgia item (at least as far as the studio is concerned) without a huge fanbase.  A couple of extra scenes that didn't need to be in the movie - hey, that's why they had to wait for this DVD; a good-enough widescreen transfer.  I'd love a director's commentary on this film, but I guess I'll just have to go look up what Dante has to say about it elsewhere.",1382400000,,2956,4.653256704980843

That being said, Explorers was the perfect movie to me when I was a kid, but watching it again for the first time in fifteen years, things have changed. The story follows three young boys who start having weird dreams. They decide to build what they see in their dreams and to their surprise they build a spaceship. The boys are pulled into outer space, where they meet a group of aliens who are obsessed with our TV broadcasts and use different characters and scenes in order to communicate. As a kid, the story was magical, but as an adult, it was very lame. The hysterical aliens were unbelievably annoying and all the 'cool, futuristic' stuff is now simple classic eighties cheese. As for the cast, they are terrific, obviously, that's why two of the three boys grew up to be stars. Explorers was a favorite of mine as a kid, but that's really who it's aimed at. I watched it again because it's streaming and I loved it then, but watching it now kind of ruined it for me. This isn't like the Goonies, which is good any time at any age.

1180829,3,B000003KCU,"I remember seeing a tape of this movie once when I was a kid, although even back then I seemed to have a pretty good grasp of what the movie did right and what it did wrong. As an adult revisiting it, I can see with a lot more clarity how this movie started out with great potential, but unfortunately it suffers from a bit of an identity crisis in the third act that stops the movie from being the classic that it could have been.

The first two acts of the movie are great. We are introduced to a strong cast of A-list child actors who all deliver great performances-- no doubt due to the direction by Joe Dante, who directed Gremlins (which, unsurprisingly, was executive produced by Steven Spielberg). If you are familiar movies like Close Encounters, E.T., or the more recent Super 8, and even The Goonies, this movie will immediately have a familiar sense of charm. The story of some innocently mischievous kids getting into a bit of trouble so that they can build their own spaceship is something just about any kid can identify with, and the way the movie approaches the ends up being strangely plausible. The kids are memorable characters, and seeing the journey that takes them from happening upon a crazy, mysterious idea to flying their own spacecraft is one that will capture the imagination of both the young and old.

Unfortunately, the destination is not nearly as satisfying as the journey. When the kids get into space and finally make first contact, the thoughtful ""Spielbergian"" wonder disappears quickly, and is replaced with an obnoxious saturday morning cartoon. The aliens themselves look like leftovers from a Ren and Stimpy cartoon, and they are about as tactfully written. The rest of the movie did such an admirable job of taking itself seriously that when our protagonists come face to face with pop-culture spouting Nickelodeon rejects, the movie falls apart.

I will always remember this movie as a mixed bag, and a missed opportunity. You get 2/3 of a great movie, and the last 1/3 of a crappy one. The first two acts of the movie definitely at least make it worth checking out, but the fact that the movie started off so strong only to rapidly devolve into cartoonish antics keeps it from being a must-see. I almost wish I had just stopped the tape when the kids made it into space, and left the mystery of the aliens as just that so I could better enjoy the rest of the movie for what it was.",1357689600,,2426,4.598152424942263

1180832,2,B000003KCU,"Explorers is a sci-fi fantasy story about three boys who travel in a makeshift spacecraft, and make first contact with an alien race. There are sly references to science fiction classic novels and movies, a chance encounter with advanced alien technology, and three archetypal young friends (the thinker, the feeler, and the rebel outsider). With positive reviews on Amazon and Netflix, I thought I had a real winner. Unfortunately, the movie felt extremely flat, boring, and severely dated.

Cinema is a medium of a particular time and place, rarely transcending those constraints. Most of the movies produced in Hollywood are conventional, conservative, and mired in present day ideas. Although Hollywood considers itself highly progressive, embracing progressive causes, supporting democrats, inserting political messages in the script, it is actually hidebound and derivative, with a few exceptions. This movie surprised me, it was so dull, lifeless, and, well, dead. I might as well be reading Cicero, so old and dated did it seem. I know that Cicero says important things, his writing is a classic, etc, but that doesn't make reading him fun. This movie doesn't really say anything, and it should be fun, because it doesn't have anything else going for it.

Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix are here as young teens. Phoenix already has that unhappy presence which made me think of his drug overdose and death on a sidewalk, outside of an LA nightclub. The dialogue is klunky and artificial, not at all like real life. We accept current modes of movie dialogue without question, but within a few years it becomes unbearable. If I had seen this movie in 1985, I probably would have overlooked the shortcomings, but now it just looks ridiculous. Most of today's movies will soon look the same way.",1353542400,,1797,5.088135593220339

Despite this silliness angle, they also make an attempt at some kind of ""message"" which only made it worse. The sequence was also stretched out to three times the length it needed to be.

1180852,2,B000003KCU,"Featuring early performances by Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix, Explorers is a very basic kid's sci-fi film featuring three middle school boys who are able to build a spaceship out of junkyard parts and then use the one genius' technological ""flying ball"" wonder to cause the ship to be able to travel into outer space, eventually to an extra-terrestrial spaceship featuring 2 goofball green alien monster kids who just happen to have a huge love for American television. If this sounds completely far-fetched, that's because it is. But what you end up with is an overall just barely average film with very little real comedy and very little enticing action. I bought this movie as I am a big fan of 80's films and was looking forward to seeing 2 very classic Hollywood actors in early child roles. Yet what I ended up watching was really, a disappointment.

Initially, the ""space team"" really only involves River Phoenix and his friend played by Ethan Hawke, River being the science wiz and Hawke being the more rambunctious lady's man. They eventually recruit the anti-bully anti-hero rough and tough kid (played by an actor I don't remember), and the three set out to build an elaborate flying machine. Unfortunately, what starts out in what could be a very interesting premise given these character's personalities is wasted on a plot that nobody really cares for. River invents some sort of hovering device which he can somehow create using his computer and control it as well. The effects for this pink ball thing are cheesy at best, but then again I'll forgive it as this is an 80's budget film. The three boys then go to a scrap yard and we get our obligatory montage scene of the them using all types of hardware to create a floating metal ball they can all three travel in. All this time you're wondering where the movie is actually going, or if there is any real conflict or antagonist these kids encounter. There isn't. Thus still, we're there watching these three kids we ACTUALLY LIKE going through the motions of a preset barely average plot.
The kids eventually get into outer space and land in some kind of ship where they meet up with a very child-friendly green googly-eyed alien who just happens to be just around the three boys' ages. They also meet his googly-eyed kid alien sister. What follows is the second half of this mostly yawn-inducing yarn where we just get to watch this dumb alien spout off pop culture tv references. The three boys are figuring out that these aliens are ""just like them,"" so as not to scare any little kids watching the movie. The alien kids eventually get in trouble with their alien dad and the three boys are back off to their own home planet.

The biggest gripe I had with this movie is that it really does nothing, and goes nowhere. There is no real conflict between the boys and another antagonist, or even conflicts within the boys themselves. The film starts off showing these three boys in their middle school setting, which could very well have been used to introduce new characters that maybe the boys could have had some sort of dealings with in regards to their space project. One girl shows up who Ethan Hawke's character likes but nothing is ever made of it. The rebellious boy of the trio saves Hawke's character from getting beat up, but nothing is ever made of the conflict between them and the bullies. Not even any of their parents are ever showcased. In short, nothing is ever done. What is even more aggravating than this is that these boys really do put on great performances, and each of their own characters is highlighted well, thus we come to really like them, and maybe hope they can be used in some other ways. Perhaps Ethan could have ""accidently"" brought on board the girl he likes, or be forced to do so. Perhaps one of their parents could have come into conflict with them and their spaceship building project. Perhaps the bullies could have messed up the boys' plans somehow, or stolen the science nerd's idea about the flying orb, and used it in irresponsible ways, causing the boys to devise some kind of plan. I don't know, SOMETHING besides what we get here. Because anything else would have worked given the three very good and willing actors these filmmakers had to work with. Yet we get nothing, and I wish the entire portion of the scipt having the boys land on the alien spaceship had been scrapped, as that overly long, overly annoying and overly boring part of the film really ruins the entire thing completely.

So if you want to put on something that'll entertain your 3 year old (as I don't really see this film entertaining anyone older than that), then buy this one and pop it in for an hour and a half. They'll forget it in 10 minutes, as will you.",1330473600,2,4749,4.624407582938389

1180876,4,B000003KCU,"This film is really a good one, and it is well worth any viewer's time.  The acting by the young Ethan Hawke was just awesome, and the range of emotions and skill he had at such a young age was truly impressive.  It is such a shame that this film did not do well when it was originally released as the storyline of the film is pretty good, the acting by all the main characters was quite impressive, and the special effects used in this film were really advanced considering this film was made around 1984/1985.  Ethan Hawke truly did a fine job in his role as his performance really carried the film not that the other actors were bad in anyway.  My only quibble with this film was the aliens as even the Hawke character was frustrated about the sillyness of the aliens he and his friends encountered.  The tone of the film was quasi-serious with the boys experimenting with their newfound knowledge with everything leading up to the big meeting with the aliens.  I think the Hawke character's exasperation with the aliens probably best conveyed the feelings of the viewer as I was hoping for more from the aliens rather than their being basically the same age as the boys and probably not as mature as them.  The aliens were kind of a let down for me personally, but they were kind of funny in a way in that I am sure in the world of those boys President Carter would have probably been horrified to learn that instead of aliens learning about Earth from the recorded messages of the Voyager probes that instead they were using television of the day to ascertain how humans lived!

Despite the aliens everything else in the film was great especially with the interactions between the characters.  The intellect of the River Phoenix character Wolfgang worked very well with the idealism of the Hawke character Ben while the Jason Presson character Darron's pessimism kept everyone grounded and real.

Even though this film is from the 1980s it is timeless and can even be enjoyed nowadays.  Granted, somethings like an Apple IIE computer might seem like a blast from the past, but the feelings of the boys and their adventure is something that can happen to anyone.  I know that some folks on here had issues with the ending of the film, but considering that this was a film made from the 1980s along the lines of ""Flight of the Navigator"" and ""E.T."" I think the ending made sense to convey a sense of hope.

Basically, this is a feel good film which one can watch with the whole family, and this is a film that anyone from a young child to a grown adult can enjoy as it does appeal to everyone.

If this film is ever remade, then I hope that the aliens can be made to be less ridiculous as they came across, and it would be really nice if there could be more of a background to the helicopter pilot who had caught the boys midair and who apparently had the same kind of dreams when he was a boy of their age.  It would have been interesting for that character to have been either a protagonist or antagonist to the boys as they made their journey to the alien spaceship as it seemed like his role was really truncated in this film most likely due to time contraints.",1257724800,,3168,4.437931034482759

As a family movie it was great and my boys were not disappointed with the (weak) ending.  Of course, these kids spoke up in defense of MAGIC FLUTE when I quietly complained to my wife at the breakfast table about having to sit through that one.

This film had a good plot with lots of development, decent special effects, fine young actors (including young River Phoenix) and a very effective musical score. My wife also enjoyed this film and it was an overall hit as a family movie with special appeal for me with my interest in sci-fi. I especially enjoyed the stereotypically German family living in a small American town, all portrayed as bright and scientifically minded.

Wolfgang was portrayed by River Phoenix. Incidental to the plot, Wolfgang trained a pet mouse to request cheese and offer different comments verbally in the background by pressing buttons on a speech synthesizer.  When Wolf's experiments got out of control this mouse would press the button for squeaking out with his tiny computer generated voice ""help!"" at appropriate times.

1180896,4,B000003KCU,"The 80's was a good time to be a kid as far as movies went.

Speilberg's influence was big at that time, mainly due to ""E.T."", a movie that had a big sense of innnocence and childlike wonderment. ET had a big influence on a lot of the other sci fi and fantasy movies that came out after it, for a number of years, including this film.

It was directed by Speilberg collaborator Joe Dante, & is for sure similar in many ways to ""ET"", but with a 50/50 blend of Spielbergian wonder and Joe Dante's classic movie nostalgia and wisecracks.

The three kids get the help of unseen, freindly aliens in making a sort of ""force field bubble"" that can fly anywhere, even into space...after converting an old abandoned carnival Tilt-O-Whirl car into their spaceship, they are able to put themselves inside the bubble, which, after some test runs, takes the three kids off into space, where they visit with the aleins who contacted them, being pulled in to a giant alien spaceship floating somewhere in space...
However, the aliens themselves, rather than be some sort of ""source of knowledge"" as the main character hopes, instead make the kids laugh with their own wisecracks and jokes. It is especially funny that the aliens learned to speak english from intercepting tv broadcasts that have gone out into space...thus the aliens impersonate cartoon characters, celebrities, etc...

this was not as major a film as ET was, in fact back at that time it was sadly undermarketed...I remember seeing it for the first time on HBO over a year after it came out...However, This movie is, to me, a lesser known 80's classic...not as famous as ""Goonies"" or ""ET"", but similar for it's own child-like and optimistic story.",1210809600,,1700,4.733108108108108

This is the type of movie you watch just to escape from life. River Phoenix, Ethan Hawkes and Jason Presson, play three soulmates, who meet in life, and go on an amazing journey into space. The boys share their dream states with each other, allowing them to receive alien technology from outer space, via their dreams. This results in them building a space craft using advanced transport ability to visit beings from another world who call to them. How they get there is allot of fun.

It starts first when they learn how to build a ""static-antigravity warp bubble"", for lack of a better expression, that they can house themselves in for space travel. The creatures they meet and the message those beings have to bring to all of us, the audience, is best seen, not talked about in this review or I'll give the story away. This part of the story proved to be a bit of a let down given the way the film was going two thirds into it all.  It kept a very serious down to earth tone until the aliens showed up making the whole thing a comedy in the last third of the film. In spite of this I still give it 5 stars as the first 2/3rds of the film make it great sci-fi before it takes on a camp turn in the formula. The music in this is excellent as well. Wish I could find the soundtrack on CD.

Otherwise, if you remember being this age, when you flew in your dreams and dared to achieve great things, you'll enjoy this movie. It's great fun for the entire family in my book.

I must emphasize that this film is as much about nostalgia for me, as it is about a simply good family film. As a child I loved Sci-fi, and this was one of the films that truly captured my imagination. I cannot look at a truly starry night without almost hearing the harmonica music Ethan Hawke's character plays on the rooftop, and knowing exactly what that character was thinking and feeling at that moment. Beyond awe, beyond wonder, beyond hope.

As I child spending my summer in upstate New York, occasionally the sky would be so clear you could see something akin to what he saw, so deep so vast, so wonderful.

I could also see a seriously good sequel being made to this film if the powers that be ever considered it. One that could wipe away the goofiness of the ending of the original and replace it with a more grown up ending. Sadly however I'm sure the magic, dreamlike quality of a movie set in the 80's will never be recaptured. To say nothing of the childlike wonder the movie inspires in me even today.

So needless to say I'm more than a fan of this film, one of these days I'm going to clear out the garage, find a tilt a whirl, and build my own version of the ship, even if it doesn't have force field bubble technology, it will be one hell of a conversation piece.

Anyone who was of the age at the time of this movies release and likes sci-fi, and doesn't mind the goofy ending, will enjoy this film, and nobody that I know who recalls this movie would ever say it wasn't a wonderful film. Maybe not quite on a par with the Dark crystal, or as popular as the last star fighter, or Flight of the Navigator, but this film has a magic that is undeniable. A magic that's certainly due in no small part to the great casting of the main trio. I recommend this film highly, Nuff said.",1119398400,37,1968,4.251336898395722

Actually aliens feed them information via the computer because they are bored and want new playmates.  It seems not only are our kids being babysitted by TV, but alien children are too.

1180947,5,B000003KCU,"Joe Dante has forged a unique career by making tiny, personal films that just happen to cost millions of dollars and frequently push state-of-the-art visual effects to the next level. Though many critics and younger audience members view his work as overly referential, those of us who grew up on a Cold War diet of 50s science-fiction films, stories by Bradbury, Clarke and Heinlein, and cultural touchstones like MAD Magazine, E.C. Comics and Famous Monsters of Filmland know exactly where Joe's heart lies. His finest films are love letters to his own childhood.
And mine.
As much as I admire all of Dante's work, my two favorites have always been MATINEE and EXPLORERS. It's a pleasure to finally see the latter appear on DVD. Although situated smack-dab in the middle of the 80s, the film is a big-brotherly pat on the shoulder to every kid who tried to build a spaceship in his backyard while Dad loaded the final bags of rice into the fallout shelter. Screenwriter Eric Luke (whom, as I recall, had been clerking at a Los Angeles science-fiction bookstore when this script sold) has crafted a tale of supreme silliness laced together with just enough plausible beats to allow the audience its all important willing suspension of disbelief. (No, the kids don't actually build their own spaceship, just the lovely Tilt-A-Whirl-based contrivance that rides within the alien forcefield technology they've happened upon.) The cast is remarkable; joining Dante's regular stock company (Roger Corman stalwart Dick Miller etc.) are 15-year-olds River Phoenix and Ethan Hawke in their screen debuts, the great character actor James Cromwell (BABE) as Phoenix's father (and, apparently, one of Wernher von Braun's V-2 boys), and another Dante frequent flyer, Robert Picardo (Star Trek - Voyager), in a triple role as the alien Wak, his space-trucker dad, and a badly-dubbed drive-in hero named Starkiller (a rather sly riff on the ever-popular STAR WARS trilogy.)
The sets, visual effects and art direction, particularly in the alien spacecraft scenes that occupy most of the third act, are remarkable and still have impact 20 years later. If there's a storytelling flaw to be found here - and I don't happen to think there is but many contemporary critics clearly did - I suspect it may lie in the atypical passivness of our explorers upon finally reaching their goal. Nothing blows up, nobody comes up with any great schemes, universes are neither saved nor lost. It's been argued that the main difference between movies and real life is that movies characters do stuff - they take action and make things happen. In life, mostly, we watch and wait. Well in this movie that's exactly what our heroes do - they strive to get somewhere unique, and once there they watch, they learn, they evaluate, they explore. Anethema to most current audiences (and execs), but exactly in keeping with the tone and requirements of this story, and thrilling for the depth of humor and imagination on display.
Few critics (or paying audience members) gave EXPLORERS much of a break upon first release. Against a crowded field of cute and resourceful kid movies (E.T., GOONIES, YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES etc.), it must have seemed like more of the same, differing only in the number of Chuck Jones references. But if you're a fan of heartfelt, literate science-fiction I implore you to take a chance. EXPLORERS's opening flying dream sequence both sets the tone and establishes the underlying theme of this film. This warm, deeply silly and utterly delightful movie surges and flows with a logic and timeless lilt that's usually only found in the best dreams - those all-too-rare ones you just hate to wake up from.",1098662400,7,3690,5.001626016260163
1180948,5,B000003KCU,"As a kid, I loved this film. I can't wait for the DVD so I can give it to my kids.

Background - If an alien race wanted to make contact with humans, and do so in a way as to assure that we wouldn't shoot at them, what would they do? Contact our children.

Story - This kids in the story are contacted in their subconscious with dreams of computer components and circuit boards. They begin building the parts and find that they are building equipment that could allow them to travel into outer space. They allow the 'auto-pilot' to take them to a predesignated location where they make contact with the alien race.

The film goes through the usual childhood angst. It has the childhood crush, the school bully, etc. It stars some of Hollywood's brightest child actors including River Phoenix and Ethan Hawke, and it's easy to see why they became excellent adult actors (if only temporarily in the case of River Phoenix).

Some people have given this film poor reviews, but to me it's obvious that they are watching it from the perspective of an adult. Since I never grew up, this isn't a problem for me! Get this for your kids, or just for yourself.",1098316800,5,1149,4.457142857142857
1180949,4,B000003KCU,"After a long wait,Explorers has finally come to DVD.Unfortunately,Paramount decided to make it a relatively barebones release,so anyone expecting all the bells and whistles will be disappointed. The only extras are two additional scenes....there's not even a trailer. And the picture quality isn't the best. The film looks a bit grainy and the colors seem washed out in some parts. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is pretty good,however but could've used some more bottom end. As for the film itself,those without an open mind and a vivid imagination probably won't like it. The ending of Explorers has often been the subject of much criticism but I've always found it to be highly entertaining. Robert Picardo(who would later go on to star as The Doctor in the Star Trek:Voyager series) is hilarious in all three parts he plays. And the three young actors(Ethan Hawke,the late River Phoenix and Jason""Where Is He Now?"" Presson) all do a fine job of portraying three regular kids who happen to hook up with an alien species. Explorers is lightweight sci-fi but it never tries to be anything else. Hopefully,Paramount will issue a 20th Anniversary special edition sometime next year and get it right once and for all.",1098230400,3,1212,5.0049504950495045
1180950,4,B000003KCU,"Fans of movies like ""Galaxy Quest"" will probably find this dated but still entertaining. If you enjoyed ""Goonies"" you should like this movie. Three teenage boys build a spaceship from plans that are sent to them by aliens. The fact they build it from a carnerval ride and other miscellaneous items only shows the imagination. A fun adventure for kids of all ages. The young aliens that sent the plans to the teenagers have modelled their behavior based on our TV shows. The alien comedy is like Robin Williams did in Aladdin, off the wall imitations of celebrities. I enjoyed it when I first saw it as someone in my twenties and I still think it is fun to watch.",1093564800,19,662,4.525
1180951,5,B000003KCU,"Explorers is a must for all true science fiction film collectors. The plot elegantly captures the dreams of a typical young sci-fi fan / space enthusiast. Hawke, then about 12, receives schematics from outer space in his dreams. His buddy Phoenix builds a circuit from the dream-diagram and hooks it to his computer, generating a miraculous force field capable of driving a space ship - which they build, with a third pal from school (Presson), from junkyard parts!

Joe Dante's 1985 space adventure pays homage to classic sci-fi in a number of allusions: the videos Ethan Hawke watches in bed (The War of The Worlds and This Island Earth), the old sf paperbacks and Classics Illustrated comics in River Phoenix's basement, the mouse named Heinlein (after the great American science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein), and the usual supporting roles of Dick Miller and Robert Picardo (The Burbs, Matinee, etc.). Watching this movies always puts me in the mood to reread the Heinlein juvenile novels (Have Space Suit, Will Travel, Rocket Ship Galileo, etc.).

If anyone says they're disappointed in the ending, that's only because the first 90 minutes of the film are so excellent, it's hard for any ending to live up to the oustanding buildup, including exploring the interior of a huge alien spacecraft.  Take it for what it is, and if you're into space ships or sci-fi, you'll love it.",1093046400,67,1387,4.944206008583691

...with an unfortunate emphasis on the ""almost.""
The acting and directing talent devoted to EXPLORERS is impressive, and the production values are practically perfect.  What gives this film a less-than-stellar place in the movie pantheon is precisely what most of the customer reviews condemn: those clownish damned aliens who are slugged into the third act in lieu of a climax.
All the tension-building so delightfully provided in the first two-thirds of EXPLORERS is wasted by a blow-off that fizzles in a fashion that gives new meaning to the word ""disappointment.""  Instead of slapstick, the characters and their efforts warranted something serious, something as good as what you'll read in a *real* Heinlein juvenile (see HAVE SPACESUIT, WILL TRAVEL for the perfect example), making this a peripubescent ""buddy"" movie that would have been honest-to-ghod memorable.

1180956,3,B000003KCU,"Just recently, I was forced to see the original Paramount tape in shop class for the first 2 days of school. Considering my addiction to computers, you'd think a guy like me would get the technological lingo. I did, but the tape was played too many years late for anyone else to (even then, they wouldn't get it). Considering his successes today, I'm thinking ""Ethan Hawke was in this?"" The plot's pretty shallow, even for sci-fi, which makes it the more accessible. It's about 3 junior high kids, 2 normal, 1 nerd, you have to have at least one. As far as I remember, the computer kid renders up this giant orb and after a considerable amount of time, they build a spaceship out of a Tilt-A-Whirl car, with an Apple computer as the controller of the orb that would make the car move (remember, all the macintosh and windows weren't even mainstays yet). They eventually go to this ship, which I didn't really pay attention to, because I had been sent to another room (with a TV, because the school had a closed-circuit network, but I sat at a far corner anyway, actually enjoying myself.) for expressing my disgust with this movie. A lot of it had to deal with this alien who emulated a TV set or whatever. The various references to the one, the only, Groucho Marx (very funny guy, too bad he's long gone) when he hosted You Bet Your Life, and the Beverly Hillbillies probably went over every kid's head except mine, being a good pop-culture buff. Industrial, Light, and Magic did a great job with the 3D shots, considering it was the best they could do. It's very similar to Tron (which I only saw bits of). Don't waste your money on the tape, you'll find on the Disney channel once in a while, with more footage than the tape, I bet.",998697600,2,1735,4.459119496855346
