8505751,5,B005FEPAWO,"The Highlands of Scotland at their best, rugged,majestic and enchanting at the same time.  Monty Halls draws the viewer into his own idyllic crofting experience.  I remember watching this when it was first released on U.K T.V. and I could not wait for next weeks episode.  If you have ever seen the film 'Local Hero' this DVD is a must. Make sure you have a wee dram on hand and your experience will be complete.",1383696000,,412,4.466666666666667
