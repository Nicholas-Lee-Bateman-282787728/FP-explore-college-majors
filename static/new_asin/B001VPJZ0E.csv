3823499,5,B001VPJZ0E,"It was worth the wait! I fell in love with the characters from the first season slowly and by the end of the season you, as the viewer, were quite moved by the story lines. Private Practice Season Two is better. Kate Walsh's character has mellowed the goofiness of the first series and the other characters storylines are superbly written for this new season. Each and every actor is excellent. And then the cliffhanger.  The cliffhanger is exactly what it is... WOW!!! I had to ask a freind who lives in the States what happens - I cheated, but it tells you that it is a doosey!!! Buy this DVD and have a blast.",1258243200,2,612,4.368421052631579

3823501,4,B001VPJZ0E,"In 2007, Shonda Rhimes (creator/executive producer of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and writer of ""The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement"") developed a spin-off of ""Grey's Anatomy"" titled ""Private Practice"" based on the life of Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh).  For the most part, ""Private Practice"" Season One lasted about nine episodes and received a so/so reception from fans.

For the second season, viewers were promised a much more exciting season and sure enough, Shondra Rhimes and crew were able to take the series to different heights this time around.

""Private Practice - The Complete Second Season"" features 22 episodes (Episode 10-31) on six discs.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Private Practice - The Complete Second Season"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 televisions.  Whereas ""Grey's Anatomy"" tends to be focused indoors, inside the hospital, ""Private Practice"" has a slick California look.  Indoor scenes are well-lit and outdoor scenes are quite vibrant but viewers will notice the grain in the series.  Even during the low-light scenes, you do see a bit of noise but compared to other drama series on television, the series is above average in terms of picture quality on DVD.

As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series similar is primarily dialogue driven, so it's pretty much front and center channel driven.  There is no accidents or any major sound effects or even a lot of music like ""Grey's Anatomy"" in ""Private Practice"" but for the most part, audio is clear and understandable.

The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Private Practice - The Complete Second Season"" includes the following special features:

DISC 6:

  * Patient Confidentiality: Examining Season 2 - (12:52) Creator/Executive Producer Shonda Rhimes and Executive Betsy Beers talk about wanting to focus on the moral and ethical dilemma as doctors for Season 2.  The talents also chime in on the various  season 2 storylines and add their own personal feelings.
  * Life Through the Lens: The Pictures of Chris Lowell - (8:10) Actor Chris Lowell (who plays William ""Dell"" Parker"") showcases his photography and he talks about his inspirations and the cast talk about how he is a talented photographer.  While the talents are complimentary, Lowell is more comedic when describing his photography.
  * Extended Episodes and Deleted Scenes - 14 deleted scenes with optional audio commentary by Creator/Executive Producer Shondra Rhimes and Executive Producer Betsy Beers.
  * Bloopers - (4:17) ""Private Practice Season 2' bloopers

JUDGMENT CALL:

With the first season of ""Private Practice"" receiving so-so reviews, the ""Grey's Anatomy"" spin-off needed to make sure that the second season was significant enough to captivate the audience's attention enough to stay for all 22 episodes.

So, what better with the country's economy affecting private practices, to show Oceanside Wellness Center in a similar predicament. The early episodes tend to focus on the company on the verge of bankruptcy and the Addison doing what she can to prevent the company from bankruptcy and hoping for the private practice to emerge from its problems.

But along with the company problems, each of the main characters have their own major issues.

Addison deals with major issues with the company (and eventually leading the company), problems with men, the return of her brother (and her brother working for the rival practice), her relationship with her friend Naomi starts to grow apart and we get to see Addison and McDreamy once again during the ""Grey's Anatomy"" cross-over.

This season's love triangle appears to be between Pete-Violet-Sheldon.  As Violet becomes pregnant, she is not sure who the father of the baby is and both men makes things more complicated when each want to be with her.  But if anything, the most significant part of season two is Violet's character at the season finale and to say the least, it will be interesting to find out if a major character does not make it for the rest of season three.

As for Naomi and Sam, things get quite interesting with them as Naomi now finally moves on with her life and starts to date other men (including Addison's brother Archer), while Sam starts to show more concern over Naomi as she is seen sneaking off quite often from the practice.

As for Cooper, his storyline becomes the Cooper-Charlotte storyline and Cooper now wanting to be there for his good friend Violet and move in with her and support her during her pregnancy, while Charlotte being the cold-hearted doctor of St. Ambrose and later on developing a rival practice against Oceanside Wellness, she becomes more jealous of the time Cooper spends with Violet.

And as for Dell, he has to deal with his ex-girlfriend's drug problems and finding out that he has a daughter and gets into an even more complicated situation.  Talk about a character who's likability seems to have fallen.

And as the characters face their major issues, on the medical end, the series deals with ethical and moral issues.  The series definitely received some controversy with episodes such as episode 20 titled ""Contamination"" which dealt with autism and whether or not vaccinations do cause autism, another that dealt with sexual relationship between a woman and a young teenage boy, accidental switching of embryos, physician-assisted suicide and siblings who have sex with each other and more.  Needless to say, both Shondra Rhimes and Betsy Beers definitely wanted to push the button on certain medical issues.

But part of the problem with ""Private Practice"" is that it seems as if the writers can not keep up the quality of writing with many of their characters and some are not getting the time that they need.  I felt that this was an angsty season and a season where characters storylines were a bit uneven.  Writers...please find Addison a decent man instead of having her fall for someone that is always taken.  Also, remember... Sam?  He needs a storyline.  And Dell, this character is really being jerked around quite a bit.  ""Angsty"" seems to be my word to describe season 2.  And to cap it off, a season finale that takes a story from what we see in the front page and definitely a dark and twisted finale that I was surely not expecting.

Overall, ""Private Practice - The Complete Second Season"" had a good number of entertaining episodes and the chemistry of the characters are pretty good and overall, I enjoy the problems and rivalry among the private practices but when it comes to the characters and their storylines,  I'm hoping Season 3 is less angsty.

If ""Grey's Anatomy"" stars can have its up and downs but yet find some happiness, I hope the characters of ""Private Practice"" at least get some of that for season 3.",1252972800,12,6823,5.013321492007105
3823502,5,B001VPJZ0E,"I started watching Private Practice because I love Amy Brenneman (I miss Judging Amy so much), and was also impressed that Broadway star Audra McDonald was on the show.  Boy, am I glad I did!!!  I just fell in love with the characters and their relationships... and the whole setting is just so much less INTENSE than Grey's Anatomy.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Grey's Anatomy... but it can get a bit much.  I honestly don't even watch Grey's anymore... because Private Practice is all I need.  If you are a die hard Grey's fan, give this a try... if it's not for you, don't watch it.  But you might be surprised!!  If you don't watch Grey's Anatomy, but want to watch a great show, I HIGHLY recommend Private Practice.  The acting and writing is superb... I really don't think you'll be disappointed.",1249084800,3,802,4.520833333333333
3823503,5,B001VPJZ0E,"I noticed that after Kate Walsh left Grey's, the show went downhill. Now, the only episodes of Grey's I'll rewatch are ones with Addison in them. On the other hand, Private Practice has blossomed into a great series. Yes, there are some storylines I'm not a huge fan of (Violet, Noah, etc.) but the fact that I still watch the show is a great testament to the wonderful writing of this show! I look forward to watching this show more than I do to watching Grey's, and that says something.",1249084800,4,488,4.433333333333334
3823504,5,B001VPJZ0E,"I love private practice. At times I would prefer to watch this than the madness of Grey's Anatomy.  Don't get me wrong. I'm a hardcore Grey's Fan. Its just sometimes Private Practice is a nice change.

I absolutley hate some people on Grey's and there overblown storylines. But I can honestly say I like everyone on PP. And their patients are interesting too.  Don't even get me started on the ""Baby Daddy"" drama.

Most people don't want to give it a try because Addison isn't walking the halls of Seattle Grace but she holds here own at Oceanside Wellness.",1244851200,11,557,4.595959595959596

I don't like this show and no matter how many times you cross over, you can't make me like it.  Leave the two shows alone - or cross over characters for visits but not linked storylines.",1242864000,5,345,4.276923076923077

3823574,5,B001VPJZ0E,"Not quite as good as Grey's Anatomy, but enjoyable just the same.  Many of the episodes end in cliffhangers, so you want to watch the next episode right away.  Watching on Amazon is awesome.",1338768000,,190,4.5588235294117645
3823575,5,B001VPJZ0E,The product arrived safely and in relatively good shape. The content was what I had anticapated and the very reason it was ordered. I believe it can be assumed that I enjoy the DVD/CD(s). You probably have figured out that I strongly dislike being made to write these reviews. I can see reviewing a book or a product that is being tried for the first time.,1337904000,,356,4.409090909090909
3823576,4,B001VPJZ0E,"While the season started off rather dull, by midway it had built up some incredible storylines with all the characters. I think the characters in this show have much more depth than the ones on Grey's Anatomy. The season finale was shocking and took the series to a whole new level. The closing moments of the finale gave me nightmares not only all summer long, but to this very day in 2012 I still occasionally have nightmares about that chilling cliffhanger!",1336694400,,460,4.691358024691358
3823577,5,B001VPJZ0E,"this season picks up more than the first, but trust me you won't be disappointed. you will learn many medical things and about friendship and what a good friendship means to some people. season 2 is hot and steamy and made me want season 3.",1309219200,,240,4.355555555555555
3823578,1,B001VPJZ0E,"I had to forward through the cross over from this series when trying to watch Grey's Anatomy.  It was like extra commercials. I  was not sure where to complain about this, but I do not like the Private Practice series at all.  I have similar reasons what I do not like this series as other 1 stars.  It is hard to believe they used same writers as Grey's.  I did not enjoy drama, characters and story.  The red head lady doctor was my least favorite character from Grey's, so this made Private Practice ieven worse for me.",1307836800,,522,4.329896907216495
3823579,3,B001VPJZ0E,"Things heat up in season two on Private Practice. As with this whole show the storylines are reasonably unbelievable. Charlotte King takes on a far more prominent role and unfortunately Del and Cooper (my favourite characters) take a bit of a back seat. The best thing about season two is the absolute cliff-hanger ending that makes one go straight out and buy season three. Season two lives up to season one standards (which is difficult for a tv drama to do), and there are some really great individual episodes.",1302912000,,514,4.786516853932584
3823580,4,B001VPJZ0E,"I loved Private Practice right off the bat in the first season. After having the first season cut short by the writer's strike, the show came back strong, and the characters became more evolved.
I LOVE this show to death, even more than Grey's Antomy now, and the 2nd season saw some of the saddest cases ever, and made you love the characters even more. Season 2 also saw the introduction of Brian Benben as Sheldon Wallace, who became a very entertaining character. There was also the multiple episode crossover with Grey's Anatomy, which saw Sam, Addison and Naomi heading to Seattle.

I was a little disapointed that there were no commentaries for season 2, as the season 1 cast commentaries were excellent! But the extended episodes, interviews and featurette on Chris Lowell's photography was pretty cool.",1296345600,2,811,4.91970802919708
3823581,5,B001VPJZ0E,"Wonderful to watch, great price, if you love the show you will love this, its a great show with a great story line and has interesting people and also comedy and an ending that leaves you at the edge of your seat wanting the third season.",1291852800,,238,4.195652173913044
3823582,1,B001VPJZ0E,"I thought it started out ok but somewhere along the way it turned into a sleezy sex show. The season opener for the current season started with the stupidest, cheeziest sex garbage. Had enough of it. Deleted from my DVR and no longer tuning in. Sorry the writers can't come up with better material.",1287878400,,298,4.537037037037037

3823585,4,B001VPJZ0E,This series promises a lot and delivers.  Much darker story lines and great acting.  Only disappointment with DVD is they don't have more bloopers and commentaries with the actors.  I really loved the commentaries on S1 dvd.  Thank goodness more than 9 episodes in this season.  Can't really fault with this one.,1258329600,,312,4.923076923076923
