Although she does not fit the physical description of Agatha Christie's  character, Rutherford brings a delightful touch to the character. The movie blends intrigue with humor and is family friendly.

2608202,5,B000GFTR1M,"""Murder Ahoy"", starring Margaret Rutherford, is another charming addition to the Miss Marple Movie series.  The setting is partly an English seaside village while the main setting is a small ship just offshore from the village.

The theme is the ship's crew being used to commit crimes for a particular person's benefit.  There are a total of 3 murders before the mastermind is apprehended and brought to justice.  As usual, Miss Marple is assisted by Mr. Stringer and the chief detective, all of which play charming roles.

The movie lasts around 1.5 hours and breezes along nicely.

Watch and enjoy this installment of the Miss Marple series.

2608203,5,B000GFTR1M,"There is nothing better than seeing old movies. Their simplicity and lack of special effects made acting an art, and what is better than to see a good Agatha Christie mystery unfold before our eyes?

In Murder Ahoy, we see a chief inspector of police that needs lots of help to solve a murder that takes place... on land and on to sea... Miss Marple is part of the board of trustees of a ship. One of the trustees wants to reveal something he discovered while on board, but he is murdered by a poisonous substance placed in his snuff... and as he draws the powdered tobacco into his nostrils, we see him succumb to the killers plot.

Miss Marple suspects the death was not by natural causes as the doctor has ruled, and she takes a sample of the snuff, which by coincidence was left on the paper she had on the conference table, and with the assistance of her chemistry set... for girls, she sets out to discover what substance was used.

As usual, Miss Marple comes across as a bit eccentric, her artful way to conceal that she is a sleuth on skirt and high heels. She suspects that what the murdered board of trustee member wanted to talk about has to do with something he discovered while on board, and she decides to spend a few days on the ship to discover what that is. Such fun to see her displace the captain by taking his quarters as her abode, and to see the rank and file displace those beneath her... until they all move from room to room to allow a superior to receive better space...

Well, the film will leave you enchanted with such nice detective work, conducted during a time where it was all done by the intelligence and deductive powers of individuals who had no access to computers, finger prints, or laboratories. You will enjoy lots of British humor as you watch Miss Marple take them all on, and at some point, she even duels the murderer... We thoroughly enjoyed this episode of yet another awesome Agatha Christie mystery. Don't miss it!",1222041600,5,1963,4.444444444444445
2608204,5,B000GFTR1M,"Nothing is serious in this criminal detective and private eye story. It is all humor, oh no, fun really. But who is getting the fun out of the story? Agatha Christie? For sure, and she even manages to put a direct allusion at her famous dramatic success in London for more years than anyone else, The Mousetrap. But she is making fun at a bishop, a lord and a few other social entities. And she enjoys it enormously. But we could wonder if it is not Miss Marple who is making fun of all these heavy heads and straight jacketed minds. We would be right too. She obviously makes fun of the poor detective inspector or chief inspector, of the captain, of a few more people in the dear society of Winchester. She appears as an eccentric, and she cultivates that appearance because one has to keep up appearances and because that's her true hallmark and method to capture the attention of those she wants not to see what she is really doing. To go inconspicuous, this Miss Marple knows we have to go very visible. But it could also be Margaret Rutherford who is enjoying herself at our expense, and there too I think we have a point. She seems to be enjoying herself so much that she could be God himself come down incognito. This film is a little gem of such nice detective suspense laced and stuffed with a lot of British or English humor, with a lot of tongues in a lot of cheeks. Quite  interesting if we consider it as a remnant and a testimony of a time when computers did not exist and scientific police was not yet a glimmer in the eye of an administrative law and order progenitor. And we managed to arrest criminals in those days when we did not even have a computer to process and identify finger prints.

2608233,3,B000GFTR1M,"The series of 4 movies starring Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple, a character created by the queen of mystery writers Agatha Christie, is rather strange. First there is 'Murder, She Said', which was adapted from one of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple stories, though both the plot and the character of Miss Marple were substantially altered. Then there were two movies, 'Murder At The Gallop' and 'Murder Most Foul' adapted from Hercule Poirot stories, with the detective changed to Miss Marple. Finally the producers decided they could do away with Agatha Christie altogether and create their own story- and here it is, 'Murder Ahoy'. Why they felt they needed to do this when there were many excellent Miss Marple stories to choose from, I have no idea. It might not be too surprising that this is by some distance the least successful of the four.

The plot, such as it is, begins with the death of a trustee of a naval academy for the reform of young men, who dies after taking snuff. Miss Marple turns scientist, complete with test tubes and bubbling retorts, and discovers the snuff contains strychnine. I began to get a little suspicious at this point, because the symptoms of strychnine poisoning are nothing whatever like those portrayed here- the poison causes violent convulsions, not a gentle collapse. However, Miss Marple takes it upon herself to investigate the death, which occurred after the trustee had visited the ship owned by the trust. She visits the ship herself, invites herself to stay on board and hunts for the criminal.

From then onwards, the story is played mostly for laughs and with minimal concern for credibility. The captain, played by Lionel Jeffries, is a caricature (a pity, as Jeffries is a fine actor), there is much signalling between the ship and the shore with torches so bright they reflect like floodlights on the sea, there are a couple more murders and finally, in a preview of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean', there is a sword fight between Miss Marple and the murderer. I am not making this up; Margaret Rutherford, who was over 70 at the time, does a Keira Knightley with much clashing of blades and dodging behind obstacles.

Of course, any movie starring the inimitable Ms. Rutherford has its redeeming qualities. There is some nice wordplay in the script which at least pays homage to Agatha Christie, even if the rest of the movie lacks any input from her. Miss Marple's friend and confidante, Jim Stringer, is played, as he is in all the movies, by her real-life husband Stringer Davis, and the genuine affection between the two is both unmistakable and charming. Of course, there is Ms Rutherford herself, with her collection of mannerisms and facial expressions and the comic timing which made her such a popular actress. However, if you want a movie with a little more of an Agatha Christie feel, you might want to try 'Murder, She Said', which in my opinion is much the better movie.",1432339200,,2937,4.834990059642147

2608249,5,B000GFTR1M,"""Murder Ahoy"" comes very close to being slapstick  and if there is anything Agatha Christie's novels  were not, it's slapstick. Nor was Christie's  prim Miss Marple anything like the jolly, effervescent  creation of Margaret Rutherford.  But it doesn't matter, Rutherford can easily hold her own as a superb comedienne, and if her Miss Marple is not Christie's Miss Marple, you still can never lose the genius of Christie hovering in the background. ""Murder Ahoy,"" however, is not based on any of the Agatha Christie novels. Integrating into the movie is a mousetrap- a salute to Christie's play ""The Mousetrap"" that has been playing steadily in the West End since 1952.

While trying to solve the murder (later murders) of a ship board of trustees member, Rutherford is in fine fettle. The action takes place both on and off the ship ""Battledore."" From setting up a chemistry set  (a Rube Goldberg contraption bubbling away) to discover what sort of poison was introduced into the murdered man's snuff  to taking on a ship officer in a sword fight Rutherford  never stops sleuthing and never stops moving. Joining Rutherford are Charles Tingwell (Inspector Craddock) and Stringer Davis (Jim Stringer), Craddock representing the Yard, Jim representing -well- not exactly a boyfriend but a sort of faithful companion who is there when needed like old dog Tray. It should be noted that Jim is Rutherford's real life husband Stringer Davis. Lionel Jeffries as the ship's Captain  is very funny as he tries to protect his fractured dignity after Miss Marple more or less embarks on his ship  and more or less takes over.

A lot of hanky-panky is going on aboard the ship as Miss Marple discovers and she indulges in quite a bit of hanky-panky herself. A nefarious officer on the ship is apparently conducting a school for thieves and housebreakers, squiring a group of young crewmen to the shore at night to practice their trade. The plot is lively, the cast perfect and the overall tone very British. The four films of Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple are vintage, they afford a special charm, tea and crumpets.",1409529600,,2110,4.929378531073446

2608255,5,B000GFTR1M,"Murder Ahoy has the distinction of being just an ""interpretation"" of Miss Marple (the inspiration coming from They Do It With Mirrors).  It begins as they all do, with a murder.  In this case, a man is snuffed out with snuff.  As with the other installments in the Rutherford series, she comes up against the sanctimonious Inspector Craddock (Charles `Bud' Tingwell), who manages to become more disagreeable as the films progressed in spite of the fact that Miss Marple is always correct.

As the title suggests, this film takes place at sea (or near enough as the ship in question is anchored in a harbor not far from shore).  Always underappreciated, Miss Marple is loath to deal with a bombastic Captain (wonderfully played by Lionel Jeffries as an insufferable blowhard).  He wants her off his ship but she will have her way and snoops to her heart's content.

Favorite scene, the indomitable Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) joining in a rousing rendition of Rule Britannia (if not in good voice, at least in the spirit of it).
