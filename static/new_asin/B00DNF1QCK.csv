5834723,5,B00DNF1QCK,"Best reality show!  No competitions, no phony feuds, just a family with a four generations' homesteader history who maintain many of the homesteader ways but also use modern advancements.  The Kilcher family shows recycling at a level far above sorting into color-coded trashcans and make you think about how and where we get our food.  The real star of the show is Alaska itself and its spectacular scenery and rich wildlife.",1386720000,45,426,4.971830985915493

What baffles me is the unavailability of DVDs of this show.  I could watch them repeatedly if I had the chance.  Only season one
seems to be available.  The company that makes them doesn't sell them at their site.  From my other searches - looks like they are not on DVDs.  So what gives?",1492041600,4,416,4.466666666666667

Disappointed that only season one is available on DVD. Between Hulu and my DVR Ive almost managed to record all the shows. I recommend this to anyone who's sick of the sick trash found on most channels. I hope they release the complete season 2 and 3 and 4 on DVD soon. Thanks to Discovery and the History channels there's still family values and morality aired on TV.
NOTE:  Season one, two and three are available on HULU in complete running order.",1440547200,4,603,4.532110091743119

I realize that there is only a short period to get ready for the oncoming year with collection & growing of fruit & veggies, but would have thought all residence would be better skilled at shooting & curing for fish, fowl, & meat.  My biggest surprise was the poor skills shooting (with scopes no less).  I also commend them for following all the State Hunting & Fishing laws.",1430006400,,489,4.46067415730337

5834980,5,B00DNF1QCK,"When I watched this show I could not believe no one gets cancer up there, no one complaining they were not given something by our government, no one had disease or mood disorders or taking tons of medications, no stress brought on by bill collectors and credit card companies...it is so far removed from our world that it is almost Mars.

I rarely watch any TV but I love this family, the location, the goals - that I bought EVERY series.  It is so good (and commercial free) I re-watch them and always learn something new or catch something I did not the last time.  And they teach a lot also.  Not just say ""I did this"" ... they often show HOW they did it.  Thanks Discovery and Kilchers!  Plus it gives me motivation.  When I feel too tired to walk the dog or clean the dishes I think of Otto Kilcher or his family that move mountains on almost a daily basis and I get up and GO!!!",1414886400,14,884,4.195266272189349
5834981,1,B00DNF1QCK,"I do not see why people give this five stars, It is obvious these people choose to live this way and that they are not poor or struggling . Except struggling with this life style that they chose. To live on 600 acres anywhere you need money period, not to mention all the tractors and equipment they have and livestock , all that costs money. No jobs or anything else living like that ? think about it. Nothing much new or informative on wilderness living in this series. This family is only using Discovery channel for publicity and more money and they are a boring  unlikable family to watch as well. I am glad I did not buy this but watched one episode on you tube first .I will stick with re runs of Survivor man and Dual survival. If you like it  then fine  to each his or her own , but I do not like this show .",1414627200,,817,4.09375

5835068,5,B00DNF1QCK,Finally a reality show without all the drama and script...  I've really enjoyed watching the Kilcher family and their unique way of living in the Alaska frontier.  I've watched other Alaska reality shows and you really feel their reading from a script or doing their best to create some type of rivalry drama and this is absent of all that.  You get to become a part of their family and how they help each other survive in a tough environment.,1395360000,,443,4.5125

5835124,5,B00DNF1QCK,"Our family discovered this program over winter holidays and became addicted to this hardworking, feisty and loving family. Regardless of the proximity of civilization, they choose to live a life that encompasses the land and resources in a very independent and admirable fashion, bridging modern life with a connected approach to their environment. For those of us living a pre-packaged life of grocery store chains and long commutes, the Kilchers are a breath of fresh air and a window into an alternative possibility.

We didn't find out until the last season that Jewel was related yet the family resemblance is there. Since learned that a number of family members are musically inclined around the music circuit and from what you can glean from YouTube, they are very, very talented. They also support local kids wilderness expeditions and provide produce and jams at local farmers markets. Their energy is astounding but shows what is possible when you eliminate television from your life. Very ironic because this is one of the best shows around.",1389225600,,1052,5.116279069767442

8594781,5,B00DNF1QCK,love this. although it only has a couple of disks. the last one has one episode and the rest is basically a documentary on alaska. pretty boring and lasts for hours. waste of space wish there was more shows. left us in suspence about what happens after the last episode and i can not seem to find any season 2 or any other seasons on Alaska the last frontier. GREAT BUY. worth the money spent,1509926400,,392,4.24

8594784,5,B00DNF1QCK,"I bought this for my family because I love this show. Orginal I just thought this was season one but it's actually season 1 and part of season 2 (which is weird, at least put all of season 2). They should put more on DVD because I think it's dumb to buy it digital especially when it's more expensive. Anyway I enjoy this show because it's so heartwarming and funny.",1501027200,,366,4.242857142857143

Where are the rest of the  scenes I've seen on tv. The 3rd one was a big dissapointment. I know there are more  episodes. Feel like I  was ripped off, just when it was getting good.",1499472000,,310,3.9516129032258065
