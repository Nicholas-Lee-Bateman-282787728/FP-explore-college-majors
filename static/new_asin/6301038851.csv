I think it once changed me how the way I feel about life and in the future. MLK has always been an inspiration to me how the way I'm livin' and how I'm playin the horn which is the trumpet. I praised God that he would've been 2day to see what it is. May God bless his soul.

And check out the movie ""King"" from the late Paul Winfield (1941-2004) R.I.P.",1104105600,2,485,4.0
8164691,3,6301038851,"Contrary to what a previous reviewer wrote, ""I Have a Dream"" has had three sections chopped out of it; it's still a good version of an important speech.  The audio here is often excellent -- good selections  from the December '62 speech to the SCLC, a good cutting from ""I Have  been to the Mountain"", a good (but too brief) quote from one of the  anti-Vietnam speeches.  One long section from just before the third Selma  march (the one that succeeded) is also very fine.  Well worth the money for  those with an interest in public speaking and rhetoric.  As sort of a  bonus, you also get Bobby Kennedy's impromptu eulogy (though the space  might have been better used for more of King).
Editing, however, veers  all over; there are four ""assembled"" speeches (ones that were  never given, assembled from pieces of other speeches).  All of the  Birmingham material is fragmented and out of order.
Further, the  nostalgia footage, while giving aging boomers an excuse for a good cry, is  so extensive that we only actually see King for about 1/3 of the tape --  the rest of the time you get the tiresome video editorializing for which  the Speeches Collection is infamous.  You don't learn nearly as much as you  should about his delivery, and practically all footage of audience reaction  is missing, so if you want to study King as a speaker, in detail, this tape  will be very frustrating.  (Is Joan Baez on a march really more interesting  than MLK?)
Finally, two areas of King's career are stinted: his  antiVietnam activity (we get only his short defense of his doing it -- none  of his actual critiques of the war), and his preaching.  To really  represent him and his style, at least a few minutes of a sermon --  especially of one of his evangelical ones -- should have been  included.
So three stars: there's material here that belongs in any good  collection of public speaking, but there's also a lot of ""Speeches  Of"" video hash and emotional pandering.  If you use it to teach speech  or rhetoric, now and then you will need to teach against the tape.",952300800,75,2065,4.610497237569061
8164692,5,6301038851,i bought this video tape about 2 or 3 years back and was very moved by it. Dr. King's words have always given me hope and helped me think out problems.his speeches are timeless and important to all Human Beings that  are striving for a better Future.,949795200,4,250,4.319148936170213
