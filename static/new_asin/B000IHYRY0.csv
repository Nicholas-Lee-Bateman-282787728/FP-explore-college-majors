2657873,5,B000IHYRY0,My 4 year old is facinated with the garbage man and garbage truck! I was so happy to find this DVD Garbage Monsters! Movies on Garbage Trucks are hard to find! He loved it. Thanks!!,1168300800,2,181,4.2
2657874,5,B000IHYRY0,Totally trucks/Garbage Monsters is so much fun!  My three-year-old son can't stop watching these videos!  More please:),1161734400,,119,5.9411764705882355
2657875,5,B000IHYRY0,"We got all three dvds in this series for our nephew (2) because, like a lot of boys around his age, he seems obsessed with large industrial vehicles.  He watched these dvds in something like a trance.  There are educational elements cleverly slipped into the action, but mostly it's trucks doing all kinds of cool, trucky things I didn't even know about.",1158883200,,354,4.693548387096774
2657876,5,B000IHYRY0,"It's such a simple yet brilliant concept.  Just give little boys what they want...TRUCKS.  Real trucks, big trucks, every kind of truck and machine you can think of.  The footage is put together in a fast and fun format that grabs their attention and holds it. My son loved the videos and keeps coming back for repeat viewings.  You owe it to yourself to try them.",1158537600,,364,4.46969696969697
2657877,5,B000IHYRY0,This dvd was absolutely wonderful.  My grandson was transfixed by the ongoing action.  He is two and loves to watch the real ones but now we can do stop action and watch again.,1158537600,,176,4.303030303030303
2657878,4,B000IHYRY0,I bought this DVD for my grandson who is 3.  He loves it and watches it several times in a row.  Very informative on recycling and how important it is for the enviroment.  I also found it interesting and I watch it with him.,1350172800,,224,4.045454545454546
2657879,1,B000IHYRY0,I agree with previous reviews- this video is a tease.  My son wants to see garbage trucks.  There was only 5 minutes of them.  How hard can it be- just record a garbage truck all day.  don't waste your money.,1297814400,4,208,4.125
2657880,5,B000IHYRY0,"My 2yo son absolutely loves this DVD.  He is a big fan of garbage trucks, seemingly becoming more obsessed by the day.  This video shows picking up garbage, a recycling center where recycling is sorted and loaded on to trucks, dumping garbage at a landfill, and compacting the garbage in a landfill, and covering it up with water and dirt.  My son (and I) have learned a lot about garbage and garbage trucks from watching it and it is far and away his favorite DVD.",1242259200,,465,4.447058823529412
2657881,2,B000IHYRY0,"This movie would be 100% better if it wasn't so L-O-N-G...In the beginning its 15 mins of watching the garbage truck pull into the recycling area, and it just DRAGS on.  My 4 year old son liked it at first, but I find he hits the rewind button over and over - perhaps in hopes of it doing something else.  Not the best movie I've purchased for him and I am glad that I didn't spend the money on the three pack !!!",1238198400,3,413,3.963855421686747
2657882,5,B000IHYRY0,"My 4 y/o son loves big equipment and garbage trucks, and this DVD provides it all.  My 7 y/o daughter secretly enjoys watching this DVD as well.  Good, clean, action in approx. 30 mins -- great length for those parents worried about how much TV their kids watch.  Highly recommend.",1236124800,,281,4.58
2657883,5,B000IHYRY0,"A friend gave this to my daughter for her 3rd birthday. It is her favorite DVD, and she favors it over her Sesame Street and baby Einstein DVDs. It has helped her with her memory recall, counting, and recognizing basic geometric shapes. This is a great gift for a boy or a girl.",1230422400,,278,4.264150943396227

2657885,5,B000IHYRY0,Very happy with this purchase. My 3 1/2 year old son loves it. I like how it shows each kind of truck and what it's function is. Now my son can see a truck on tv or while we are out driving and he can identify it. It's very cute. I would recommend this dvd to anyone with a child who loves trucks.,1181174400,2,297,3.7301587301587302
2657886,4,B000IHYRY0,A great video for my 3 yr. old son who loves garbage trucks.  I think any kids who love garbage trucks will really enjoy this video.,1179273600,,132,4.076923076923077
2657887,5,B000IHYRY0,"My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES this DVD.  He's obsessed with all things trash (dumpsters, trash cans, garbage trucks, and..yes...porta potties), so I did a random DVD search on Amazon for ""garbage trucks,"" and the Garbage Monsters DVD came up.  What a find!  The ""learning"" aspect of the DVD is a little contrived (pointing out different shapes on the trucks), as is a lot of the dialogue, but my son doesn't mind.  The recyling sorting sequence is a bit too long and tends to bore my son, and I would have included more shots of garbage trucks picking up dumpsters & other trash (my son loves to watch trucks do this, and this part of the video was way too short), but overall this video is a big hit.  It's hilarious to watch him rock out to the ""Garbage Monsters"" head-banger music at the beginning of the DVD.",1178496000,3,810,4.409395973154362

8145626,5,B000IHYRY0,We rented this vid so often at the library that is it was a nice birthday surprise for my grandson to have his own copy.,1396742400,,120,3.84
8145627,2,B000IHYRY0,"This isn't for us.  Our 2 year old loves trash and construction trucks, and will watch boring YouTube videos of them all day.  But, this was extra boring and had a lot of trucks that he couldn't get into.  We wanted video of just trash trucks doing their thing, and that only happens for a  minute here.  Then, they realllly cheerily try to add in some educational things - pointless.  Get another trash video IMO.",1386806400,,414,4.453333333333333
