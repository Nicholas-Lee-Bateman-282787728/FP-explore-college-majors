4042781,5,B002ZVAONA,I realy like this film it's very easy to follow and has a simple story and with out spoilers has a happy ending,1426982400,,111,3.869565217391304
4042782,5,B002ZVAONA,The movie is great.  The quality of this instant prime video that Amazon is selling is horrible.,1426982400,,96,4.647058823529412
4042783,5,B002ZVAONA,enjoyed movie very real life,1425945600,,28,4.8
4042784,4,B002ZVAONA,"This is a glimpse at the new world of families and a gay couple's struggle to adopt and live as a loving family in a prejudiced world. I think some of the humor may be lost in the English subtitles of this Swedish film but there is still so much to enjoy. While it is not as great as the film Shelter (who could compare with Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright) the love of an unconventional, supporting family makes this movie well worth seeing.",1424044800,,438,4.226190476190476
4042785,5,B002ZVAONA,"I have nothing bad to say at all. i watched this for the first time with my roommate who is not into Gay cinema as much as I but It became one of Our, and especially one of my Favorite Films in all. Addressing the concerns that many Same-sex, and even, non-same-sex couples can expirience with adoption/fostering, relationships and making the best of what is given. If you have not watched it do yourself a favor, and do so now. Its funny, heart warming, heart wrenching, and just Damn Good.",1423958400,,491,4.466666666666667
4042786,5,B002ZVAONA,"Just a good solid movie.  No one dies, gets ""repairative therapy"", gets beaten up or contracts a nasty disease.  And there is no bitter or bittersweet ending; at the end is simple satisfaction.",1422748800,,193,4.818181818181818
4042787,5,B002ZVAONA,This is the third time watching this movie and every time it makes me laugh I enjoy this movie very much and would recommend this movie.,1422748800,,136,4.269230769230769
4042788,5,B002ZVAONA,"Very interesting twist on the adoption theme by making the parents be a gay couple.  Thinking they were about to get a little baby, and ending up with a homophobic teeenager, sure puts a spin on what they were expecting in raising a child.  I think that the 15 year old boy precipated a break-up between the couple that not only surprises them both but the viewer as well.  Many relationship issues examined as well as cultural and societal norms.",1402790400,4,447,4.5625
4042789,5,B002ZVAONA,"I saw this film at the Palm Springs film festival and can't wait for it to come out in USA format so I can show it to my teenage kids.  In excellent dramedy form it touches on many societal themes while portraying a couple trying to adopt a child.  Some of the themes: the ambivalence that sometimes comes into major life decisions when one partner desperately wants something and the other goes along with the decision, complexity and dysfunction in families, alcoholism, romantic love, parenting, exploitation of young people, fear of the unknown, homophobia and inclusion despite the minority of homophobes, forgiveness",1262995200,26,622,5.088235294117647
4042790,5,B002ZVAONA,A quietly beautiful movie about love and acceptance.,1488412800,,52,5.625
4042791,5,B002ZVAONA,Wonderful will watch again,1485561600,,26,5.75
4042792,5,B002ZVAONA,"This was a touching and interesting film, chronicling the story of a teenager from the foster care system who comes to live with a gay couple.  Its various twists and turns keep the story interesting, and the character development keeps us interested in the players, who are excellent.  To my surprise, this is NOT a comedy, though there are some funny elements.",1481500800,,362,4.82258064516129
4042793,5,B002ZVAONA,"bit slow at first, actually turned off movie for a bit, came back, glad I did!",1481500800,,78,3.9375
4042794,4,B002ZVAONA,"I thought this was an really fun offering, I enjoyed the movie even though I needed the subtitles more that I wished as my Swedish still needs work. It was a good movie about love and acceptance across the board, I have yet to be let down by Gustaf Skarsgrd in any role he's played.",1475366400,,282,4.1454545454545455

4042798,4,B002ZVAONA,Great foreign gay-themed movie! It was a very eye opening film.,1469664000,,63,4.818181818181818
4042799,5,B002ZVAONA,Great movie!,1469491200,,12,5.5
4042800,5,B002ZVAONA,Tom Ljungman is outstanding in a difficult role as Patrik.  The incorrigible teen punk character first introduced in the film is developed into the lonely orphan desperate to find a home and stability.,1467072000,,201,5.090909090909091
4042801,5,B002ZVAONA,"This was one of my favorite movies before I visited Sweden. Now that I've visited twice and am currently learning the language, I think it's one of the best, realistic depictions of gay relationships.",1465603200,,200,4.911764705882353
4042802,5,B002ZVAONA,"I just watched this again about 6 months after the first time. Its a wonderful movie. Gustaf Skarsgard is just great in this role. The whole cast is great.  Its warm and touching. Loved it.

I guess some thought it was predictable, and yes, at the outset I knew they'd all end up together, but the script and acting were so good that I didn't find the story predictable at all. The flow was very organic and it just worked.  There was real chemistry between the characters.  Its in my top  10.",1464048000,,493,4.315217391304348
4042803,5,B002ZVAONA,This is hilarious and heartfelt movie about unconditional love and loving someone that is different.,1461715200,,100,5.733333333333333
4042804,5,B002ZVAONA,This was a very well done story that portrays a gay couple and the problems and pressures they face as would any heterosexual couple wanting to adopt and raise a child.  There were extra challenges because they were gay and suddenly found themselves with a 15 year old homophobic and troubled boy who previously had numerous brushes with the law.  How they worked their way through all of this was a very absorbing and in the end heartwarming story.  I rate this as an excellent movie.,1453248000,,485,4.616279069767442
4042805,5,B002ZVAONA,Great product!,1443657600,,14,6.5
4042806,3,B002ZVAONA,"Predictable from the first scene.  However, it is engaging in a mindless, satisfying way.",1442448000,,89,5.357142857142857
4042807,4,B002ZVAONA,"A sad and funny story, well acted. Demonstrates how discrimination and prejudice can be overcome with knowledge and love.  For fans of Vikings, this Stars the actor that plays Flokio.",1442361600,,183,5.1
4042808,5,B002ZVAONA,Had alot of meaning. A really good movie.,1441843200,,41,4.25

4042810,5,B002ZVAONA,I love this movie but I speak Swedish so it was cool,1438819200,,52,3.4166666666666665

4042812,5,B002ZVAONA,"my daughter chose this movie and I was very much pleasantly surprised, because i didn't rally want to watch it. quite good.",1435622400,,123,4.636363636363637
4042813,4,B002ZVAONA,"Had it been overdubbed in English, rather than subtitled (which wasn't stated when I rented it) I'd have given this move a full 5 stars.",1433721600,,136,4.48
4042814,4,B002ZVAONA,"It was an interesting premise, not the same-old-same-old. It kept my attention, was entertaining and had a few funny moments amid the poignancy.",1431043200,,144,5.304347826086956
4042815,4,B002ZVAONA,"I've seen this movie at least 4 times, and each time it grows on me more. The plot is straight forward, a gay couple try to adopt a child. The letter comes in the mail and says ""Patrik, age 1.5"". When Patrick arrives he is a troubled 15 year old. Really a charming movie, very well acted, and with an interesting take on the story. Perhaps not a movie for the Hollywood Blockbuster crowd, but for those who love Independent film, this is a great movie. I think the underlying theme is that, not matter how unlikely, when you are home, you are home.",1430611200,,548,4.278846153846154
4042816,5,B002ZVAONA,"I thought it was well written, well acted, and was one of the few gay films I've seen that ended happily.",1430352000,,105,4.0476190476190474
4042817,4,B002ZVAONA,The video quality of this film in SD is distracting. Otherwise this glimpse of gay family life in a Swedish housing development is touching and a comedy mostly in the sense of having a happy ending.,1429660800,,198,4.527777777777778
4042818,4,B002ZVAONA,"I liked this movie very much.  A gay couple applies to adopt a child and are told that there is a 1 1/2 year old boy available, but it turns out to be a 15 year old boy.  The boy has been bouncing between placements and group homes for years and is damaged.  The stress of the situation impacts the adoptive couple's relationship.",1429315200,,330,4.2063492063492065

8385355,5,B002ZVAONA,"I loved this movie when I saw it on Netflix...but it disappeared from the shelves all to quickly. If you want a movie about ""Gay family Values"" this is the one to watch.",1519948800,,169,4.151515151515151
8385356,5,B002ZVAONA,Very Well Done,1510185600,,14,4.0
8385357,5,B002ZVAONA,Heartwarming movie as the 'ungrateful 15 year old teen' pulls you in to absolutely love him and the other cast members as the movie starts slow and then builds and you don't want it to end. Not one for subtitles but this one gets my 5 stars as I read and watched it.  The Sweden location added greatly to the movie and to see how LGBT has it's own problems in Sweden for acceptance.  All works out in the end.... not going to spoil it for you but YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!,1506470400,,477,4.118279569892473
8385358,5,B002ZVAONA,A really good story!,1504483200,,20,4.25
8385359,5,B002ZVAONA,"This movie is excellent. It shows the prejudices gay people have to live with and probably the best way to combat it. The main character, Gustaf, is kind and loving and doesn't believe in violence. So even when a kid asked Gustaf if he was a homo while not even knowing what it meant, he gently answered yes and explained it to the young kid. The movie is very well acted.",1500854400,,372,4.253521126760563
8385360,5,B002ZVAONA,"Brilliant.  It starts slow but accelerates rapidly.  It's not coming out; but, it is figuring out. Oh, just a bonus point: In a true change of genre and amazing tribute to his acting, one of the cast members is Floki in a popular series.",1499644800,,237,4.363636363636363
8385361,5,B002ZVAONA,"Another movie that surprised me, both with the quality of the production (especially the writing, character development and acting). I typically only watch (and then buy if I like it) gay romance movies or romantic comedies. This is not that kind of movie. It's one of those topics that doesn't typically interest me (adoption by a gay couple), but I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. The movie has, at its core, that class misunderstanding that launches a lot of stories. In this one, the ""baby"" they are supposed to be getting, turns out to be a very hardened teenager who has been in ""the system"" all his life and is quite jaded. As things unfold, we see the couple disagree and go through all kinds of turmoil as they wait to have this ""mistake"" picked up and taken elsewhere...and their own child brought to them. Of course, things don't go as anyone expects. There are a number of twists and turns, but if you're a fan of movies that end in a satisfying way (not exactly a classic Happily Ever After), you'll be glad you watched this.",1499644800,,1041,4.484210526315789
8385362,3,B002ZVAONA,mildly entertaining. No real story here. The description on Amazon is inaccurate.  The kid is hardly the bad seed the description makes him seem,1496016000,,144,5.0
8385363,3,B002ZVAONA,it was a good movie,1493164800,,19,3.0
