8000923,5,B0000DG047,"Fans of the modern anime masterpiece The Big O can finally stop holding their breaths, as the long-awaited sequel to everyone's favorite new giant robot series arrives...

When the last series left off, our hero Rodger was wounded, in the pilot seat, outgunned, and outnumbered. Things were just about to start to get interesting... Amazingly, unlike the first Big O where mystery followed mystery and plot points and characters were developed slowly, this series gives you a one-two punch from the get-go and never slows down.

The change of pace will delight some, confuse others, and perhaps irritate those unwilling to adapt, but at no time does it fail to entertain. In the past Rodger Smith was always a cool, calm, collected individual that was always in command of the situation. The first episode shows us right into the heart of what makes up his world and how he relates to it, giving more character devlopment and introspection in that one episode than perhaps the entire first series did. And from there things just get crazier.

Watching the first few dvds, it almost seems like the creators of this show decided ""To heck with style, let's just tell people what's going on already!"" Characters who before just talked in riddles (remember Dorothy and Rodger and Angel and Rodger's conversations from Big O?) now S-P-E-L-L things out for you. In a way, the new directness of the show is very appealing, as the relationships of the characters evolve and they open-up to each other and become more honest and straight-forward.

And while the old style isn't quite there in terms of animation and music (the dark noir-style is replaced by a more pastel-looking universe and more uptempo versions of the old themes are present from time to time), there are moments of sheer brilliance to be found. Some people found the music of the first Big O overly repetitive, and I agree (although the score was most excellent). The new Big O has some music that's so dramatic and so moving, that it made me IMMEDIATELY purchase the soundtrack (a new version of the main theme which can only be called a ""love theme"" really takes the cake). The action sequences are also flashier, prettier, and in general, a bit cooler than before.

If you wanted your questions answered (How do Dorothy and Rodger really feel about each other? What is Rosewater after? Who is Angel REALLY working for? What's OUTSIDE of Paradigm city?) then this series will probably be most satisfying to you. The plot really thickens this time around, with things getting more and more dramatic as the show progreses (to say nothing of more profound {get a load of all the religous references, and the questions on the nature of what makes a person human, what a person's place is in the universe, and can a person change their destiny}). Big O II really is what a sequel should be. It's not just more of the same, but an entirely new perspective on a universe and characters that we have grown to love. HIGHLY recommended.",1094083200,,2989,4.773694390715668
8000924,5,B0000DG047,"Most of the time I hate cliffhangers, but in this case, I love it.  When we last saw Roger he was about to battle three other robots, with the help of Big O and Dorothy, and season two gives us what we want.  Not just a real battle between the robots, but also a battle for his mind.  Flashbacks of memory he never knew he had, fighting old enemies and finding brand new ones, and clues to what had happened forty years ago.  Batman, Noir and Gasaraki all mixed into one.  Better strap in for the ride!
I just hope Roger and Dorothy's relationship is developed more in the future.",1079136000,,580,4.236363636363636
8000925,5,B0000DG047,"And once more with feeling. The series starts off right were the first ended. And I mean RIGHT were we left off. So If you haven't seen the first series yet, by all means do. This one starts a little darker and pretty much turns everything on its head. But were on the road to some fundamental truths about this strange place that is Paradime City. And in this first four eposide installment we begin to see the web of haft truths and whole lies come together. With Roger Smith right in the middle of the whole mess. New enemeies will be made and new allies found. Including the return of the lovely and mysterious Angle. The origins of the Big O and Norman will be revieled in part as well. Its a strange new world wrapped in a old decayed familer one. The puzzle is coming unwound very slowly to expose what exactly happened 40 years ago. Or is it?  -we have come to terms-",1079136000,,875,4.271084337349397
8000926,2,B0000DG047,"Let me preface this review by saying I love the Big O. It has been one of the most rewarding and thought provoking television series I've ever had the pleasure of watching. The mystery of Paradigm City and the purpose of the strange robots known as Megadeii is fascinating.
Big O II picks up where the first season left off, and places the viewer right back in the action. The animation has changed a bit, and the episodic nature of the first season has largely been replaced with a more serial format. While I enjoyed the first season very much, I feel this was a change that needed to come; obviously there was something strange going on in Paradigm, and to tell the story a more complex and interwoven tale was going to have to be told. These first episodes of the second season immediately shake some preconceptions the viewer may have had about the series after season one, and introduce new elements and characters into the story, paving the way for what is to come.
Now to the reason I gave this 2 stars. I own both a Windows PC using a Pioneer DVD drive, and a Toshiba SD-V391 DVD player. The DVD did not work in either device. The disc just spins and is attempted to be read unsuccessfully. Suffice it to say, I'm disappointed. I can survive with my videotaped copies off of Adult Swim, but I was looking forward to being able to view this series at a high visual and sound quality, and be able to pause the episodes to get a closer look at what is going on in each episode. From my own internet investigation, it seems that Bandai has unapologetically been releasing many of its series' DVDs with these defects and not fixing the problem. I am currently attempting to get a replacement, but based on the aforementioned investigation, I have little hope that this replacement is going to work any better. While I'm sure the disc works on some players, I feel compelled to warn potential buyers that the disc may not operate on your player.",1076025600,,1948,4.490140845070423
8000927,4,B0000DG047,"Big O season II picks up exactly where the first season left off.  The style of the show, however, has noticably changed.  Gone are the one episode stories that focused on aspects of the main characters, and a direct storyline is followed for the entire second season.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, however the inherent reliance on the first season episodes will make it hard for someone not acquainted with the Big O to follow (if you are interested in the plot of the first season, please consult the various Amazon.com pages for a summary).
The actual depth of storyline has also decreased with the second season.  Granted, the first season of the Big O contains some extremely thought provoking episodes, but the second season just cannot compare.  All that said, it is great that we were all given some closure (for those of you who don't know, the first season ended in a cliffhanger a few years ago) on the situation in Paradigm City, with all the original Japanese voice talent intact.  Those of you who have never seen the Big O before are still in for a treat, and hardened Big O veterans will get enjoyment from seeing their favorite Negotiator back in action.",1066867200,11,1184,4.641148325358851
