4089774,5,B0038N9X3Q,"A woman heads to Ireland in order to force her boyfriend to accept her wedding proposal by scheduling it on leap day, the only time when he couldn't refuse due to the country's tradition. Declan a handsome innkeeper throws a wrench into the woman's plans. Very funny and sweet. Amy Adams was perfect as controlling Anna. Matthew Goode was funny and great delivery. Not perfect, but if you're in it for entertainment and a feel-good story, rather than as a movie critic, I think you'll really enjoy it.",1269648000,4,501,4.704545454545454
4089775,4,B0038N9X3Q,"I went into this movie expecting your typical romantic comedy and it pretty much was what I expected. Although this movie was chock full of cliches, it was still cute and charming in its own way. The scenery of the Irish countryside is worth seeing the movie just for that. Amy Adams was great in her role but I thought it took too long for the audience to warm up to Matthew Goode's character although by the end, you very much wanted them together. This movie isn't going to win any awards or be remembered in the long run but it was cute, had some genuine laughs and was overall very enjoyable. I would recommend seeing this small, sweet movie.",1268524800,4,647,4.4
4089776,5,B0038N9X3Q,"The tone of the movie is light and whimsical, entirely in tune with the traditional romcom. I enjoyed this more than many other recent romcoms. Rather than just go through the motions it plays like a cross between some yesteryear Cary Grant comedy and that great 80's movie, The Sure Thing. The charming leads portray some genuine chemistry, ably demonstrated in the inevitable kissing scene - handled much better here than it was in The Proposal for instance. The sprightly dialogue and contrived situations allows the leads to be flawed and wonderful in equal measure. They also get a couple of lines of bittersweet back story; the interwoven sentiment allowing us to care for them as well rounded human beings, each with a bit of depth to them. They bicker and fight amidst some breathtaking scenery, this visual poetry is ably assisted by a fine musical score. A couple of the jokes were obg's (oldies but goodies) particularly the scenes with the old Irish drinkers but despite this I found myself laughing out loud more than once. Also, Amy Adams pulls of a delicious, understated, pratt-fall which isn't something we see too often. The supporting cast were fine with the notable exception of John Lithgow; he was fantastic, a five minute cameo reminding us of what a master can do with a few lines.

The romcom script has to make us believe that two seemingly ill suited people will overcome the odds and get together. This script does that by giving us a couple of exposition scenes which enable real changes in attitude between these two people, additionally, it gives each of them a moment of truth, a Damascan revelation, which allows the characters to finally make up their mind.

Giving the viewer the slow build up as well as the final crunch scenes enables a more powerful and enjoyable plot device rather than hanging the whole outcome of the movie on one single scene. This also helped me to believe the character reactions to the third act twist when it came along to pull them apart. The happy ending was an absolute delight and the kind of thing I could watch again.

So, we have likeable leads, a quirky situation and decent dialogue wrapped in fine cinematography and music. Is it the perfect romcom? For me it was.",1266883200,10,2237,4.745501285347044
4089777,5,B0038N9X3Q,"Love Period Romance Movies. Pride and Prejudice and North and South to name a few.

4089778,4,B0038N9X3Q,"Leap Year is charming for several reasons. One. It is primarily set in Ireland and the lush scenery makes it visually delicious.

Secondly, the classic storyline is freshly retold. A girl who is on the cusp of living her perfect-for-her fairy tale life, lacks one thing, an engagement ring. Her charming, but irresponsible father, reminds her of an Irish tradition. Every leap year, a woman is able to propose to the man she loves and then her dreams will come true. It had worked for a member of Anna's (Amy Adams) family.

When Anna's cardiologist boyfriend fails to propose (oh, he delivers diamonds, but of the earring variety) the night before he leaves for a medical conference in Dublin, Anna decides enough time has passed and she'd grab hold of her dreams and use the Leap Year legend to make it happen. After all, Jeremy is already in Ireland, so there must be a wee bit of fate involved.

Finally, there is serious heart in this movie. Declan (Matthew Goode) plays the angry, wounded bartender who agrees, after a series of travel mishaps, to haul Anna to Dublin. Anna, determined to create the secure life she never had as a child, begins to break down Declan's walls. As the two interact, they soften towards each other and begin to understand one another. There are a couple of satisfying scenes when realization dawns and both actors silently emote feelings that can't be put into words. Leap Year is an old-fashioned romantic story that didn't involve sex first, love later or require a lot of four letter words to make a point. Comfortably PG.

Of course, this is romantic comedy/chick flick territory so there are predictable and yeah right moments.  But when the movie is this sweet, does it matter where Declan got clean clothes that fit, or that the intelligent, savvy, extremely methodical Anna didn't think about electricity issues in Europe? Not at all. When this movie releases on DVD I will purchase it.",1264809600,87,1929,4.7807807807807805
4089779,3,B0038N9X3Q,Despite it's predictability. I found myself liking it anyway. I thought the chemistry between Goode and Adams was enough to carry the movie. I would buy if the Dvd came out. While it not a contender for a Oscar and Golden Globe. It was a very nice movie.,1264636800,,254,4.3125
4089780,3,B0038N9X3Q,"February 29 comes once every four years. How I wish movies like ""Leap Year"" were released with the same frequency. To say that it's bad would be untrue, but dang it, I've seen this movie a thousand times. It would not be enough to call it formulaic; these days, it seems romantic comedies are mass produced from a cookie cutter, and unfortunately, the blade shows no signs of getting dull. Maybe I need to be institutionalized. After all, the definition of insanity is doing something repeatedly and expecting a different outcome. Incidentally, I was reminded of this a year ago, when a reader so kindly informed me that my opinion of the Rene Zellweger comedy ""New in Town"" wasn't valid. I guess we're at a point now where audiences no longer mind knowing how everything will turn out before entering the theater. That may be why the ads for this movie exhausted 90% of the plot.

And what of the plot? Anna, a real estate stager from Boston (Amy Adams), has spent four years with her heart-surgeon boyfriend, Jeremy (Adam Scott), who still hasn't proposed to her. When he's unexpectedly sent to Dublin for a cardiologist's convention, Anna decides to follow him. You see, an Irish legend gives license for a woman to propose to a man on February 29, and lo and behold, this is a leap year and Jeremy just happens to be in Ireland in late February (the next leap year is actually 2012, but never mind). His flaws are made abundantly clear as soon as he's introduced: Although he's pleasant, he's not especially sensitive, and his appearance is so pristine that it's obvious he puts his needs above anyone else's. So what exactly does Anna see in him? I guess she missed out on the ""He's Just Not That into You"" craze.

When her plane is forced to land in Wales because of inclement weather, Anna begins a hellish journey across rough waters to an Irish village on the Dingle Peninsula. Once there, she comes across a rundown pub/inn run by Declan (Matthew Goode), a surly and cynical young man who hasn't fared too well in the relationship department. He's in need of cash to pay his rent, which Anna will give him if he agrees to drive her to Dublin. He begrudgingly accepts the offer. Thus begins an all new series of hellish journeys for Anna, most of which involve comedy routines that come dangerously close to the slapstick antics of Lucille Ball. Poor Anna - she just can't seem to catch a train or a taxi on time, nor does she seem capable of adapting to Irish culture. For Declan, it's a matter of having to put up with a superficial American woman who actually believes in falling in love.

Now, I could describe more, but honestly, do I really need to? Can you not see where this is going? Even if you can't, surely you've seen the ads, and have they not already spelled everything out for you? Were it not for the casting of Adams and Goode, there would be very, very little about ""Leap Year"" you wouldn't be able to get from any other romantic comedy. They're both indeed great actors; Adams, beautiful in that cute and wholesome way, is still very much a likeable presence onscreen, and Goode, having appeared in films as diverse as ""Watchmen,"" ""Brideshead Revisited,"" and ""A Single Man,"" proves he's capable of great range. And yes, they have chemistry, even at the early point in their relationship when they can't stand each other.

Watching them, one can't help but wonder why such talent wasn't put to better use. Romantic comedies are a dime a dozen - anyone can star in them and have more or less the same effect on the audience. More or less. Maybe we should regard Hollywood romances the same way we regard teen slasher films, which generally have been vehicles for unknowns trying to break into the business. Adams and Goode are at a point now where they no longer need to appear in a story this contrived, implausible, and predictable.

All the same, I'm not against romantic comedies. Remember, I gave passing grades to ""Music and Lyrics,"" ""No Reservations,"" ""P.S. I Love You,"" ""What Happens in Vegas,"" and ""Definitely, Maybe,"" and I greatly enjoyed last summer's ""The Ugly Truth."" Yes, they were all conventional, but I appreciated both the character development and the stylish approach given to their respective stories. But ""Leap Year,"" harmless though it may be, has absolutely no ambition to be anything more than what it obviously is. The story is completely foreseeable. The characters are flatly constructed. The humor is unappealingly broad. If general audiences can accept this, why can't I? Did I actually go into this expecting something different? I'm ready for my straightjacket now.",1263600000,3,4625,4.711990111248455
4089781,4,B0038N9X3Q,"Being Irish myself I was somewhat interested in checking out this rom com with Amy Adams, another excellent reason to see any movie.

So, legend has it that in Ireland a woman can propose to a man on the leap day of a leap year. When an anticipated proposal does not emanate from her doctor boyfriend, Anna hears of this legend and so she has to go to Dublin to propose.  Imagine.  Dublin.

So, Murphy's Law intervenes, and the flight gets diverted, to Wales, and to make a long story short has to take a really roundabout route to get there in a beat up old Renault 4, with an obnoxious yet somewhat charming Irish guy, who gives her no respect.  And Murphy, well,  he just keeps getting in the way, and will she even get to Dublin.

But, if you put a woman in a car with a charming Irish guy for any length of time, warm feelings can start to develop. So, things happen they way they do, and it's all done with great humor, the scenery is fantastic, it's like an Irish postcard at times.  Amy Adams is amazing, and her costar,  Matthew Goode is also excellent.

The one thing I will say is every Hollywood movie about Ireland has the obligatory cows blocking the road scene.  It does happen, but come on.

I think you would really enjoy this movie, and I highly recommend it.  If you like this type of movie, consider

4089782,4,B0038N9X3Q,"I love romantic comedies and got really excited when I recently saw the preview for Leap Year. I love Amy Adams and remembered Matthew Goode from a few other movies(Chasing Liberty, Watchmen, Match Point). Lately, there have been a lot of romcoms that don't do it for me, they're just lacking the heart, that certain something. Thankfully, Leap Year had heart, laughs and was just all around a well done movie. 24 hours after seeing it, my boyfriend and I were still talking about how much we liked it.

The premise is that Anna(Amy Adams) has been dating her doctor boyfriend for 4 years, they're buying an apartment together in Boston, and she wants to get engaged, but he hasn't asked. So she plans to surprise him in Dublin while he's away on business on the one day in Irish tradition that says the woman can propose to the man, Feb 29th of a leap year. Of course, her trip doesn't go as planned, and she ends up needing help getting to Dublin from Declan(Matthew Goode).

While predictable as far as romantic comedies go, it was fast paced, funny and romantic. We both really liked Matthew Goode's character and his sense of humor. He was excellent as a multi-faceted leading man. I love Amy Adams because she seems like a regular girl(funny, sweet, not a twig)and she was perfect for the role of Anna. The scenery of Ireland was gorgeous, and makes you want to take a trip there. Definitely a great date movie, worth paying to see.

Unfortunately, no good special features on the DVD, only some deleted scenes. I'm a sucker for ""making of"" featurettes and thought they might at least have done a little something about filming in Ireland. You'll only find a bare bones DVD here.",1262822400,139,1685,4.61

4089881,5,B0038N9X3Q,"Leap Year is a film that to call it predictable would be a severe understatement, every single new hurdle thrown at Anna's plight to get to Dublin, you knew as soon as that hurdle appeared how that scene would play out.  But that doesn't mean Leap Year isn't a really enjoyable movie.  It does have accuracy faults, such as why would a plane going from Boston to Dublin overfly the whole country of Ireland and end up in Wales? They would have been better to have had the reason suddenly Ireland is closed to flights/ferrys due to a new outbreak of foot and mouth disease or something and she had to pay off a fisherman to be a people smuggler for her to get there in time. Then you've got the bigger geographical question of why would a boat that can't make it to Cork coming from Wales, end up going around the circumference (Cork is roughly on the bottom of, Dublin on the East) of Ireland to end on the West Coast of Ireland?  For someone wanting to get somewhere quickly, she must really have annoyed the boat owner for him to prolong her journey and dump her there.  Would have likely been quicker to take her to Dublin. Since money seemed to be no obstacle for her, I'm sure she would have paid him to take her directly there by boat. Not to mention she doesn't actually need the rude pub owner who doesn't like her or ever want to set food in Dublin again, to actually take her there.  He could have just driven her to the next small town with a taxi, or the next major Irish town such as Tralee or Killarney to get a train or a bus direct to Dublin.  If she was offering enough cash, a taxi could have probably come from Tralee to take her to Dublin or to where she can catch a bus or train. There's a scene where the two main characters need to pretend to be married, yet it is odd the religious insistors don't notice neither is wearing a wedding ring. Also the next day event doesn't make any sense with this couple who now how badly Anna needs to get to Dublin.

But those sort of things don't ruin the film. It's a lot of fun.  It's your typical rich upperclass woman (throw in the fact she's an American tourist who clearly knows nothing about Ireland) who gets off side with a working class local, hates him for not treating her like a princess, but needs him to get her to her destination in exchange for large wads of cash (which I wondered how she had, including coins for the payphones since she arrived by a boat dumping her on a beach, perhaps she exchanged money in Boston but you're unlikely to get coins for your destination in your own country).  Amy Adams and Matthew Goode do great job as the two clashing lead characters. Adam Scott as Jeremy her fiance which she needs to get to in Ireland where he is attending a medical conference so she can propose to him on Feb 29, not so much.  You could tell what was going on with his character and how that was going to play out.  But that could be down to the writing more so than his acting I guess.

There's some great Irish scenery, the journey is a fun one, the film could have ended in Boston with satisfaction at how those event played out but I guess the unrealistic ending they tacked on is probably what a lot of fans of the genre want.  Spoilers for the ending - I wonder how long the two would last though. Especially without the excitement of the events journeying to Dublin. Anna is from Boston, a large city, Dingle is a small (movie version although real one isn't that big either) couple of buildings town.  What's she going to do for employment there?  Would she even be allowed to work without a working visa?  I guess they get married quickly so she can stay in the country (although I doubt in real life it's that easy).  Even if she could legally stay and work, rural Ireland is very different to a big American city.  I lived in Killarney for a year a lot bigger, more populated place than Dingle, I'm also from a big city in another country to Ireland and there's a lot of lifestyle difference.  I would seriously doubt the Anna character would not be bored and feeling unfulfilled very quickly in Dingle. Sure Declan could move to Boston, but selling a rural pub would take a while, and he's not likely to get the full value for it.  Then you've got the opposite, how long would a guy used to living in a town with a handful of people, cope in Boston?

If you liked Leap Year's plot, you might want to also check out 1995's French Kiss, where Meg Ryan is in a similar scenario needing the help of a French local she doesn't initially like much either.",1514678400,,4548,4.283547257876313

4089903,4,B0038N9X3Q,"Attractive & appealing actors intimately filmed in  Ancient Erin , this is a light & cute rom-com with some amusement & also challenge comparing old & new worlds, mothership to offspring across The Pond. Not so heavily accented that we Americans must rewind/replay to catch all the dialogue, I just realized too this wasn't ruined with gutter language & sleaze making me squirm & fast-forward through actors committing adultery or pretending married sex on screen ~ a refreshing break & far more romantic  , and leaving something to imagination & illusion. Male lead a sensitive Brit charmer who manages Irish, and naturally chemistry with fellow Aries, beautiful Celtic Woman, Amy Adams, a treat seeing her ensconced like a jewel in her setting of origin ~ home at last.  (The other male actor same Aries Fire + Cancerian Water ilk as the two leads, born a day apart.) I just wish it had showcased more of the grand old Celtic . f you liked ""Legally Blonde"" or Ron Howard's Irish grandparents' story film ""Far & Away,"" sure & ye should like this too. Certainly you'll feel like you've enjoyed a tour in the Auld Sod  ",1507680000,,1118,4.742268041237113
4089904,5,B0038N9X3Q,"One of the sweetest movies I have seen in a long, long time. No gratuitous violence, sex, profanity. Instead, a very sweet story about two sweet, hurting, in the end open and vulnerable people who see and fall in love with who this other person is. Just such a wonderful movie, the kind that seems very difficult to find. Can't recommend this highly enough.

interesting side note:  Rotten Tomatoes critics gave this a 21% thumbs up. Audience was 47%.

I saw the movie 'First they killed my father' the other night. Rotten Tomatoes critics:  89%. Audience 84%. And this is a movie I would recommend to no one. Dark, overly dramatic portrayal, and probably not realistic enough, of what happened then. A tension that was unbearable, and finally numbing.

I compare the two because for many who have reviewed here, it's 5 stars for Leap Year. We love it. yet the critics and whoever the audience is for Rotten Tomatoes, it's a flop.

I think truly good, kind, sensitive movies -- devoid of the violence, sex, profanity -- are looked down on by many. It's a reflection of our society, and not the movie -- not this movie. This movie is a beauty.",1506038400,2,1142,4.600985221674877

4090025,5,B0038N9X3Q,"A rare film about an intelligent and strong-willed young woman who knows what she wants and pursues it will all her heart and mind -- despite it being considered an inappropriate goal by the standards of her culture. The people are recognizably those in the real world, unlike the odd paper cut outs that people most films. They fumble along, just like you and I do. Funny and warm, it's one of the best in the long tradition of romantic comedies.

Amy Adams is one of the best actresses of our time, and she carries the story with her expressive face and body language.

Also -- if you don't have one, buy a blu ray DVD player. The difference in the image quality is amazing! Mine cost only $50, and was well worth it. Especially in a film this, with its close-ups of the people and long-shots of the wonderful Irish scenery.

4090034,4,B0038N9X3Q,"I enjoyed this film for the backdrop.  The actors are interesting, but playing characters that are not altogether likeable, but you don't hate them either.  There is a curiosity about them. The guy played by Matthew Goode is scruffy looking, but there is a handsomeness to him no matter how hard the filmmakers may intentionally try to hide that.  His character is jaded and cynical, while the girl, played by Amy Adams, is pretentious, naive, and wanting everything to be on a perfect schedule.  She is beautiful, but hides that behind this uptight buttoned up annoyance the first half of the film.  Along the way these two characters are forced to spend time together where naturally they gradually soften and begin to grow fond of one another to experiencing feelings of love.  This is a good movie to throw on a rainy day when you have nothing else better to do or you basically want to take a break and do nothing.  It isn't Shakespeare and it's not fantastic, but it is enjoyable.  It does what a rom-com is supposed to do.  You know it's about bringing the romantic leads together in a manner that prompts you to cry out, ""Oh, that would never happen in real life!""  While the love story aspect is almost silly and cliche, it is enjoyable if you can remove reservations and the cynical attitude that the Matthew Goode character has.  What I really enjoyed was the main character, and that is the backdrop that is Ireland.  The romantic aspects of this film are not so romantic, but ridiculously predictable.  Two characters are thrown together by fate, allegedly, and who have to endure one another for a short period of time.  Naturally they hate each other in the beginning, because that always happens when it comes to real love right?  Neither are remotely likable at first, but as time progresses on you may find they are starting to rub off on you positively and you hope they get togehter.  Or as someone cynically said, ""They deserve each other.""",1483747200,,1961,4.673469387755102

4090115,5,B0038N9X3Q,"This movie is a walking cliche and yes....it has been done a million times over but yet there is something so intensely sweet and charming about this film that I just keep watching it. It might be the lush and gorgeous scenery of Ireland, it might be the ever goofy and charming Amy Adams who isn't afraid to laugh at herself. It could very well be the subtly handsome Matthew Goode with his adorable accent and his incredible body language acting skills. It might even be the silly and predictable script that feels fresh some how. I cannot put my finger on it but it is clean, fun comedy. If you go into it wanting a sweet romcom and not an Academy award winning heady movie them you will enjoy it. An extra bonus is that you can have it on with your children running around and you absolutely have nothing to worry about. Don't listen to the haters on this one. It is a blast.",1474416000,10,879,4.301204819277109

We had enjoyed the movie for its simplicity and beauty before our visit to Ireland, but it took on deeper significance after we had traveled through the country and seen the filming sites.

4090187,5,B0038N9X3Q,"It was an interesting co-incidence that I saw this movie on the eve of St Patrick's Day - was totally clueless about the plot/setting/culture before selecting the movie - it just so happened to be the eve of St Paddy's Day. And there is something quite inexplicably awesome about seeing the right movie at the right time - like Christmas movies are awesomer (not a word, I know) on Christmas Eve.

Nonetheless - I could have seen this on any day of the year and loved it just as much. Mostly because, the biggest highlight of the movie (for me) was not the timing, but Matthew Goode (note: I am possibly unfairly biased) - I did not think much of him on first sight, but boy did he grow on me!

However, Leap Year is a charming movie for many reasons - it's a classic plot freshly retold with a lot of humor and heart; it's set in Ireland, which makes it a visual delight.. and finally - Matthew Goode (did I mention him already? yes? never mind, he deserves repeated mentions).

All in all - Leap Year is a sweet romantic comedy, perfect for anytime of the year. Highly recommend.",1463961600,,1081,4.3681592039801

Through traveling via mandatory road trip as strangers, they come across many situations where they are forced to get to know one another.  As a 'romantic,' at heart, you begin to root for Matthew's character straight away.  Through all the twist and turns that they encounter, it is positively 'delightful,' to watch every single one.

4090279,1,B0038N9X3Q,"Painfully horrible.  Amy Adams cast as yet another completely self-involved woman.  ""Predictable"" movies need not be horrid, but this one takes the cake.  Unbelievably, it is not unlike watching 'Julie and Julia' - but without the redeeming factors and other actors in that movie.  Directors and producers really need to stop catering to a public which seems to enjoy stories about women who ceased to mature at the age of 12.",1457395200,,426,4.957746478873239

Leap Year is super cheesy and quite predictable, like most rom-coms. Matthew Goode is in the final season of Downton Abbey and plays such a contrasting character that it's fun to compare the two if you're into DA. I probably wouldn't watch it again.

Wow, I mean wow, this movie covers all of your romantic comedy bases along with all of your leap year bases. Amy Adams is as charming and lovable as ever... if only her boyfriend of FOUR YEARS could see that! She attempts to take advantage of leap year tradition and turn the tables on engagement traditions but let's just say the tables get turned on her!

The story line is predictable and the script is often weak and sometimes nothing short of cheesy, but it's good, wholesome entertainment, and the west coast Irish scenery is breathtaking.  Declan (Matthew Goode) is a bitter Irish pub owner and Anna (Amy Adams) is a visiting American on a mission.  Their two-day adventure heals Declan's heart and recourses Anna's passionate mission.  If you are looking for a movie that is a good, lighthearted romantic comedy, Leap Year is exactly that, and I recommend it for your viewing.",1455235200,7,687,5.107142857142857

Overall, the movie shows what can be done by a talented director, producer and cast. The setting is beautiful, with awesome Irish landscapes. Casing is well done, with Amy Adams at her cutest.

4090367,5,B0038N9X3Q,"Loved it.  Watched it a dozen times on Netflix and finally bought my own copy.  An unlikely romance between an uptight, perfectionist, ambitious American woman waiting somewhat impatiently for her cardiologist boyfriend to propose and finally taking matters into her own hands, and a jaded, irreverent, cynical Irish pub owner.  I don't love all romantic comedies, and turn off many of them halfway through because they are so shallow.  But these two actors, plus the delightful supporting cast playing stereotypical Irish characters and the beautiful mini-travelogue of stunning Ireland, just got to me.  There is a unique chemistry between Amy Adams and Matthew Goode, and although they are both capable of strong performances in dramatic roles, and reportedly both sneered at their own film as being beneath their usual quality of material, they are magic together on the screen.  Whatever it is, it worked for me and I am grateful for another charming film to add to my collection.",1453334400,,985,5.163522012578617

It was very romantic and all, but it seems they should have a conversation about what they want out of life, and oh yeah, we both have lives in separate countries.  Everything was pretty cute and picturesque up until that point.",1453075200,,494,4.52808988764045

(And, of course, the heroine stumbles through the tough Irish terrain in a pencil skirt and impossibly high heels while he just chuckles at her inappropriate attire.)  And surprise, surprise, they fall in love.  We've seen it all before, with better execution and tighter editing.

As usual, we have a clumsy heroine and a grumpy hero, but I really appreciate the range Amy Adams and Matthew Goode are able to bring to their roles. The script thankfully treats them well, moving between pointed humor and physical comedy with a nudge and a wink. But they are genuinely talented actors, and they dig into their characters with relish.

I especially enjoyed seeing Matthew disappear into his character. Coming from his clean-shaven, dapper appearance in ""Chasing Liberty"", his scruffy, Irish barkeeper guise was a refreshing departure. There are some lovably ugly sweaters in this movie that only he could pull off.",1431475200,,757,5.056

4090765,5,B0038N9X3Q,"What a delightful blend of classic road picture and romantic comedy! Remember ""The Sure Thing"" with John Cusack? This has many of the same elements: Two widely disparate individuals, a place they much reach, a time element and one catastrophe after another.

Although Amy Adams (Enchanted and ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"") is the titular ""star"" of this chick flick, every female exiting the theater was talking about Matthew Goode, who continues to impress me. So far he's been an American thug in ""The Lookout,"" a wealthy Englishman in ""Match Point"" and a gay American Navy officer in ""A Single Man."" This time he's an Irishman, authentic brogue and all!

Adams' character stages real estate for brokers' open houses in Boston; she has a keen eye for decor and makes dwellings irresistible to potential buyers or renters. She has been involved with a cardiologist for four years and finally, exasperated, decides to fly to Dublin where he is attending a medical convention. She intends to employ an old family tradition and propose marriage on the 29th of February.

Due to bad weather, she lands way off the beaten track and the rest of the movie is a chronicle of her strugglesIN HIGH HEELS!as she tries, by hook or by crook, to get to Dublin in time to propose. Goode runs the local pub at the first wide spot in the road where she alights... dragging her Louis Vuitton luggage, trying her best to be chirpy and persuasive, while he tries to make sense of her demands. We are treated to lovely scenic shots of the Auld Sod, which she sees at first only as impediments.

No clich is overlooked and it doesn't matter: At the end, we still care about what she would save in case of a fire, if she had 60 seconds in which to decide.",1427587200,,1736,4.608414239482201

Not only are none of the characters likable they are (ALL) downright irritating.  The performers in this movie all have done better work.  I am sure they are ashamed of ""Leap Year.""

Yeah, it has its issues, but then it's a romantic comedy so I'm not going to hold it to the same standard as serious drama. It's greatest and most glaring flaw was the writing, the contrived plot devices made me wince at times, though it improved later in the film.

The chemistry between the characters in this movie succeeded in appealing to a thoughtful romantic audience while avoiding a coarse or purely sexually driven plot. The scene shots of Ireland are stunning. Amy Adams and Matthew Goode were captivating, compelling, and comedic in their roles. Beyond the first blush of this sweet tale..or rather at the end of its rainbow, there is a pot of gold; a wise message for those like me who like to ponder things. I can enjoy this movie again and again.",1417651200,,572,4.73

4090950,5,B0038N9X3Q,"Witty with great banter that makes you laugh.  Amy Adams starts off as a true ugly American (she asks the airport people to fly her into Dublin despite a total bad weather shut down because it ""just won't do"" to fly in the next day) and grows slowly to realize life is an adventure that is too valuable to waste because it doesn't fit into your plans.

This is what Rom-Coms should be",1417392000,,384,4.2465753424657535
4090951,5,B0038N9X3Q,One of my Top Five romantic comedies.  The chemistry is great between Amy and Matthew.  The scenery of Ireland is beautiful and the movie just 'clicks' for me.  What can I say... I'm a die-hard romantic.,1417392000,2,203,4.583333333333333

This one should probably get four stars because the storyline is basically implausible, but it's fun, Amy Adams is always great, and Matthew Goode has an accent! Swoon.",1416528000,,363,5.169491525423729
4090964,5,B0038N9X3Q,This is a wonderful love story that starts out with the female lead going to Dublin to propose on Leap Year.  Her plane lands not in Dublin so she needs someone to drive her there.  She runs into an indifferent man who offers to take her where she wants to go and the problems begin.  It's a cute little movie I've seen four times now.  Liked it so much I had to buy it as a lift me up when I get down.  The actors are just right for the parts.  I recommend this for part of a comic collection.,1416528000,,494,3.89

4090984,2,B0038N9X3Q,"She's not Lucille Ball and the movie beats the girl about and makes her clumsiness without reason so that it just seems as if we are meant to dislike her for what happens to her because her character is not genuine enough for us to hate her and then come to like her on its own merit. And the way the movie forces them to connect is unreasonable as well so you don't get the pleasure of the magic of two mismatched personalities finding one another and falling in love.

It is a frustrating movie to watch.",1415923200,2,506,4.216494845360825

To be honest and open with ones pain, hurt, rejection, betrayal, past is the key to opening up new doors and relationships that are brought to our doorstep.  Now it's our choice and courage to be bold enough to face ourselves, our past, let go of the repetitious thoughts and behaviors and reach out to receive what our heart has always been longing for.",1415664000,5,515,4.468085106382978

I loved the Irish scenery & people.  This is a ""feel good"" movie & I will watch it over & over.  I also recommend watching Amy Adams in Trouble with the Curve.

But I caught it recently on HBO, and I love it. It's a really sweet movie with two very appealing stars. Amy Adams is exactly as expected -- adorable, funny, pretty. I hadn't seen much of Matthew Goode, but his Declan is the perfect foil for Anna's ""every girl"" persona. I wish we all had a Declan to fight off bullies, hitchhike through Ireland and cook dinner with. I have watched it a couple of times because Goode's Irish accent took me a a few viewings to completely understand what he said. The scenery is gorgeous. Even if you're not a rom-com fan, watch it for the greenery of Ireland. But I watched it for Matthew and Amy -- they're wonderful together.",1413936000,,814,4.258064516129032

I was sucked right in within only a few moments, but I missed the first 20 minutes or so.  What I seen of it was really great and I laughed a lot.  This is a good romantic movie with laughs, tears, and mushy feelings.  Amy Adams was great and this was my first time watching Matthew Goode.  They were both great and dare I say this is now one of my favorite movies? Yes.  Yes, I'll dare to say it.",1412294400,,508,3.9215686274509802

4091059,5,B0038N9X3Q,"It got very mixed reviews when it came out.  Matthew Goode even has said it embarrasses him!  (I mean to write him a letter one day about what he missed in his own film!)  It's made me want to visit Ireland which is the first reason I was interested in watching it.  However, since then I've watched it numerous times--NOT admitting to how many!)  Why?  It's about two people struggling with their own weaknesses and hurts but who, when they meet, can't help being unwillingly kind to each other even though they think they can't stand each other, causing comic scenes and snappy dialogue against gorgeous scenery.  What makes this movie a standout is that the characters are good people, and they hold fast to their personal constrictions of integrity in trying situations.  The chemistry between Amy Adams and Matthew Goode keeps one hooked; they are wonderful actors!  Loved, loved it!  It's probably in my all-time top ten movies, and I'm a movie fanatic.",1411430400,,959,4.7926829268292686

I will not recommend this to anyone unless they want to see picturesque scenes of Ireland.

4091118,3,B0038N9X3Q,"In its totality, this film  registers only slightly above the formulaic 'the country mouse and the city mouse' plot line (in this case the mice are romantic love interests). Yet, Matthew Goode grounds the story, with his impeccable presence, wit and openness and Amy Adams contributes with moments of selfish city girl silliness and 'am I feeling something honest?'.  Pour this all into a breathtaking Irish scenery and lovely character actors and we have moments of revery for a simple and honest life, told by a cast of urban and rural strangers.

Don't expect anything completely awe- inspiring, complex, or brilliant. It's just a simple love story. And what I really appreciate about this movie is how innocent and lighthearted it is. Kind of a breath of fresh, romantic air. Adams and Goode have amazing chemistry and perform their personalities to a T. It was really fun to watch the steady but stubborn transformation of their relationship throughout the movie. If you're a little bored by the acting in the very beginning, don't give up on it... It gets better! And it's even better the second time around.",1408320000,2,699,4.833333333333333

4091176,5,B0038N9X3Q,"This is definitely not going to win any awards, but it wasn't made to. It was made for an American character to get stuck in a foreign land, in this case, Ireland, but not where she intends to be. Though the plane is diverted to Cardiff, Wales, that is a brief annoying because the characters there are definitely British, not Welsh, and there is a huge difference between the two. Fortunately, that is just a minor point, because she eventually takes a boat, who in the face of the storm, drops her off in a small Irish village. There she meets the local pub owner, who is also the taxi driver, who agrees to drive her to Dublin. Enter the male lead, whom they actually fall in love with even though they fight most of the way to Dublin. When she gets there her boyfriend asks her to marry him, and she accepts...though she finds out later the ""why"" of the thing, and that's kind of insulting.

But this is a great picture that you can pull out on a rainy day, pop into your DVD player, and always be entertained.",1403913600,,1014,4.30890052356021

4091198,5,B0038N9X3Q,"I've watched this movie several times and never tire of it.  A romantic comedy set, for the most part, in Ireland with Matthew Goode playing the Irish pub owner and Amy Adams the American tourist who plans on proposing to her boyfriend on Leap Year Day.  Matthew has the accent nailed and is so great in this role - a good decent guy with a mischievous twinkle in those sexy eyes of his.  The casting was well done in this movie - lots of chemistry.",1401580800,,449,4.258823529411765

Yes, it was predictable but, since I was just in Ireland and actually was at that location (Aran Islands) it was fun to see the scenery again and, the older, local folks in Ireland are pretty well represented.",1400716800,,282,4.423076923076923

While following her lackluster boyfriend to Ireland to coax a proposal from him, Amy's character is catapulted into a series of adventures with an Irish rogue (that's the best kind, right?).  He's rude; he's irreverent; he's jaded but he's exactly what she needs in her life.  I've seen this movie several times and I just keep watching.  I recommend this movie when you just need a little less ""real life"" for a short time.",1400544000,,544,4.520408163265306

Most have sex scenes or cursing or just a bunch of both that is unnecessary. I love this movie for the comedy and the romance even if it's predictable, it's something you can watch over and over without having to fast forward. And for a mom of two it's nice not having to wait till my kids are in bed to watch because there is nothing they can't also hear or see. I also am a huge Matthew Goode fan. Wish he was in more PG movies!",1399248000,3,560,3.9646017699115044

4091232,5,B0038N9X3Q,The kiss scene when they are at dinner together makes the whole movie worth watching.  Amy Adams may not be as gentle and incredible as that scene portrays but it will knock your socks off with the rest of this wonderful romance.,1396828800,,229,4.4523809523809526

4091235,5,B0038N9X3Q,"I must of watched this movie 100 times and each time I watch it I still feel a warm sensation afterward. I love how the story shows that you somtimes you fall in love with the least expected person. Most romantic movies arise false hope and expectations for love while this one does the opposite. It shows how special love really is and how the '"" perfect guy"" will sometimes not be the one who will take care of you. This movie gave  the impression that relationships come with problems but if you truly love each other it's worth it.

In my review I don't want to give away too much but just expect a good romantic movie. I would say you can watch it with kids because their is only mild cursing.",1396656000,2,698,4.2406015037593985

It didn't have the seal on it or any of the usual advertisements inside. It was, however, not scratched but I did have trouble playing it one time which made me examine the packaging more closely.

Yes, it's lightweight, but sometimes just being entertained with an easy to follow, well written comedy flick is really all we need.  I recommend this movie.

4091302,4,B0038N9X3Q,"Amy Adams and Matthew Goode have wonderful chemistry in this feel good, laugh-out-loud, romatic comedy. The supporting cast that includes John Lithgow and others from European produced films (they'll probably look familiar to you) are top form and add to the fun! I wish John Lithgow had more screen time; but you can have that in the deleted scenes found in the extras. The Irish country side and settings are simply beautiful. The movie's PG rating is spot on and great for family viewing. Simply stated: a likable hero and heroine that truly dislike one another, eventually realize after an adventurous 2 1/2 day treck to Dublin riddled with humorous mishaps that they can't live without one another. A good romatic movie without foul language and bedroom scenes. Now for the whinny part of my review: My only beef with this Amazon purchase is that it was advertised and sold as ""new"". Clearly it was NOT in it's original packaging and still had those hard to remove cellophane wrap remnants stuck to the top and bottom edges of the case. It was patently obvious that it had been resealed in shrink wrap after the literature from inside the case had been removed. What's up with that? I'd have likely thrown it away myself; but still, it confirmed to me even more that I hadn't gotten a factory sealed movie. There were even fingerprints and smudges on the disk. Admittedly, I had only paid roughly $9 for the movie in the Blu-ray format... a GREAT deal by anyone's standards. HOWEVER, as customers cannot return an opened and seal-broken DVD/Blu-ray as ""new"" for full refund, then you shouldn't be selling it to US as ""new"" in previously opened condition either. Just to be sure, I hurried to my account history and verified that I hadn't mistakenly bought a ""used"" movie but it confirmed that I had bought a new one. I purchased 5 of my family's favorite movies for our new Blu-ray player; 3 were factory sealed and 2 (including this one) were repackaged. I don't know, it's just not honest and it makes me leary to purchase more movies from Amazon. I certainly won't buy movies when it is intended as a ""gift"". Nothing says, ""Happy Birthday"" or ""Merry Christmas"" like a previously viewed DVD/Blu-ray.... NOT! If they are indeed new, then why unwrap, open, remove literature, handle the disk and repackage them? Not factory sealed means not ""new""; don't you agree? 3 stars for the movie; 1 star for the price and fast Prime shipping; minus 1 star for opened and resealed packaging; ie. a ""used"" Blu-ray.",1389312000,,2508,4.741418764302059

4091333,2,B0038N9X3Q,"Omg who are the people who gave this so many stars that I actually gave in and paid money to see it? At least it was only a rental fee. I was debating just going ahead and buying it because it's Amy Adams and Matthew Goode, and I love them. And the stars! I believed in the star system! But the two of them together had about as much chemistry as water and filtered water. Those two produce no reaction, people.

The plot is cliche at best, and the fact that the two of them had no chemistry made them cringe-worthy at the worst of times. I was constantly put off by Matthew Goode's accent as well. He's English, I know that, and hey I'm no expert but every time he spoke with an Irish accent I always thought to myself: this is really bad. Worse than some Americans trying to pull off an Irish accent. Maybe he just mumbled too much?

Also, I suspend my disbelief when it comes to movies okay. But you have to sell me on the premise I'm suspending my disbelief for. Are you really going to tell me that this two would get together after such a brief time? With nothing in common whatsoever. They have zero chemistry and nothing in common. All I could think of was ""oh honey, you're all gonna enjoy a roll in the hay, and then it'll be splitsville"". What would keep them together? I just couldnt' buy it. But maybe that can be attributed to them having no chemistry again.

Also, [spoilers*****] she heard his money problems in the beginning of the film and the cold-hearted woman didn't insist in giving him his money? He lost a car, and a good pair of shoes, and a lot of time. You should've mailed him the money!",1386374400,3,1615,4.254071661237785

Anna, whose plane was derailed due to inclement weather, still determined to propose to her boyfriend on the 29th of February while he attends a medical conference in Dublin, happens upon a disgruntled bar owner in the small town of Dingle, where she was dropped off by the ferry that couldn't make to Dublin. Declan, the bar owner, finds himself in charge of schlepping Anna to Dublin due to lack of public transportation around the area as well as his dire necessity for money (his pub is under threat of foreclosure). I couldn't imagine any other actors playing the parts of Anna and Declan. I honestly think that their brother-sister bantering reflects most relationships between men and women, and I like that that their ""relationship"" forms so naturally, without any of the guessing games and the ""will he or won't he"" that's infused in so many other stereotypical romantic comedies. I think that happens between the two is a relationship that is grown out of fondness and mutual understanding that unfolded through the two entire days and nights they spend together trecking across rural Ireland,  which is unfortunately lacking in our global perception of male-female relationships in film.",1384300800,7,1522,4.876447876447877

Most people would skip movies like that because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".  Leap Year, I have to admit, wasn't the cleanest, but it was not the worst either.

There are no sex scenes; however, a man watches a woman showering, and her nude silhouette is shown through the shower curtain; a man is seen once with only a towel wrapped around his waist, and a woman is seen in a towel; the scene is short and neither is very revealing; a woman is briefly seen in her underwear; there are a few kissing scenes, including an old Italian couple french kissing; at an inn, the innkeeper winks at a man as in a way of congratulating him for sleeping with his 'wife'. The man and woman implied here never actually do anything, but did sleep in the same bed.

The only violence is one short, mild fight scene where a man punches out three other men after it is implied that they are threatening a woman, but there is not blood; a man breaks a chicken's neck (for cooking). It is not shown, but we see the motions of his arms doing so and hear the cracking of the bones.

There is general swearing throughout the movie and as for drinking, the main male character runs a pub so there are some scenes of people drinking beer. A party scene where people are drinking wine, champagne, etc.

...
Anna travels to Dublin, Ireland to propose to her boyfriend Jeremy on February 29, leap day (according to Irish tradition, a man who receives a marriage proposal on a leap day must accept it).  She thought he was going to propose before he left, because he said he had a ""very special"" surprise for her and her friend saw hm coming out a a jewelry store; however, it turns out he just bought her earnings.  On her way there, because of the weather, she ends up in a tiny Irish town, where she hires Declan, the local pub/hotel owner and cab driver to take her to Ireland.  He only agrees because he needs the money so he doesn't loose his pub.  Almost right after they leave they end up walking because first, his car ends up in the river; her luggage gets stolen; they get kicked out another pub after a fight to get her luggage back; she misses the train because they don't get back down the mountain in time after walking up to see a castle; on the way down the mountain she slips and falls in the mud; they have to pretend to be married in order to get a room in the only B&B in town; waiting for a local preacher to drive them, she dances at a local wedding and one of her shoes flies off and hits the bride in the head and then she knocks wine onto the brides dress; distressed over what happened, she then gets drunk and throws up all over Declan's shoes.  He ends up carrying her (I guess) to town and they take a bus to Ireland.  Through all of this they somehow managed to fall in love; however, when they get to the hotel where Jeremy is staying, Jeremy proposes himself and Declan walks out.  When she finds out later the reason why Jeremy proposed, Anna rethinks what she thought she wanted for her future.

Too bad because this could have been a very enjoyable and playfully romantic film.  If you want to see an enjoyable and playfully romantic film, see the movie ""I.Q"" with Walter Matthau as Albert Einstein filmed in the actual Einstein home at 112 Mercer Street in Princeton, NJ, Meg Ryan as Einstein's niece (fictional) and Tim Robbins as a charming young local mechanic who crosses paths with the brainy intellectual niece and a helpful Albert Einstein eager to see his niece find true love.

4091438,5,B0038N9X3Q,"This movie is fantastic! The main storyline goes as follows: Anna (played by Amy Adams) has been dating her boyfriend Jeremy (played by Adam Scott) for 4 years. These 4 years of dating have passed with not even a hint of an engagement. When Jeremy has to go to Dublin, Ireland for business, Anna decides to surprise Jeremy and meet him there because as legend has it there is a tradition in Ireland that allows women to propose to men on Leap Day. The only problem is that once she arrives, she discovers that she is on the wrong side of the country. Here she meets Declan (played by Matthew Goode), who acts as a handsome Irishman, and asks for his help to get her to Dublin to surprise Jeremy. Through their journey together, they discover that sometimes you can find love in very unexpected places. Anna and Declan have fantastic chemistry in this film which made it very entertaining. It was a bit predictable but still made for a delightful film. The scenes of Ireland were very well done as well. It was definitely romantic and had a little sensuality but it wasn't too much, it was just right. If you like romance but not anything overly sexual then this is the film for you!

4091443,3,B0038N9X3Q,"In this flick, we have a woman expecting her boyfriend of four years to propose to her. When he doesn't and travels to Dublin, Ireland, she recalls her father (actor John Lithgow -- more about him later) and his story how Ireland had a tradition of every four years, on leap day, it's tradition and okay for a woman to propose to a man. Thus, she sets out to Dublin to do this...and when things go wrong, will she make it in time?

SPOILERS: In the end, the boyfriend suddenly proposes to her before she even had a chance. However, it turns out that was just out-of-the-blue and he didn't really want to. In order to get the apartment they wanted, the place wanted married people. So, it was just for something material and he didn't really value her. ""We would have gotten around to it eventually,"" he mentions. That was enough to get her to realize that she shouldn't get married to him.

I couldn't appreciate the idea that she would then agree to marry the man, Declan, who helped her get to Dublin, after knowing him for literally a couple days. He's a stranger, for crying out loud. It's not romantic and how could it even be a smart idea to marry immediately? Along the same line (though it's not suggested in the movie) it isn't bright to have sex right away with someone you barely know under the mistaken idea that it's the same as love.

The woman had it right at first, when she asked Declan if he would like to ""not make plans"" with her. She's always had things on a timetable and she wanted to relax and see where it goes. Her speech to Declan and that she travelled 3,000 miles back to see him, was romantic. The guy eventually proposes to her, saying he WANTS to make plans with her, and she agrees. They eventually drive off after the wedding ceremony that we don't see.

**END SPOILERS**

It's a shame they didn't get more use out of John Lithgow, who portrayed the father of Anna (the lead actress). He's only in there for a couple of minutes of the beginning and a portion of his participation is on the deleted scenes. It should have been kept in; I wanted to see him in more than just a cameo.

One mistake I surely noticed was, in the scene where the car rolls down the hill and into the water, the lady's leaving to walk to Dublin. However, she's going the wrong direction away from the hill. Oops.

Sure, this isn't the most original of movies and some of the ideas are recycled from other flicks, but it's something I enjoyed. I've never seen or heard of the two lead actors before and I enjoyed it. I'm half-Irish and I suppose that enbabled me to like this more. I had a few laughs, there's great music, and the fantastic scenery improve this nice n' lighthearted flick that's worth checking out.",1373760000,,2724,4.3821782178217825

No chemistry between two lead characters. Steals almost everything from other rom-coms that were original and successful. Like Amy Adams a lot, but this was not her best movie. I think if the male lead had a more developed, likable character build and maybe some charisma this movie would have worked. Not adding this one to my ""chick flick"" library.

4091479,2,B0038N9X3Q,"Remember once upon a time in the early 2000 there was this adorable singer-turned-actress who starred in the ""hit comedy"" about a girl who travels across Europe and along the way discover something about herself she didn't realize before and has a handsome travel companion who makes sure she travels safely without any harm coming to her, ensuring she makes it to her detestation(s), who then falls in love with her, and her him...?

Yep you guessed right! Chasing Liberty. Well I gave it away with the title of my comment but anyway...

What is even more hilariously or shameless is that the lead actor in that film, Matthew Goode, is the same as this one.

And much like the original telling of this concept, the two lead characters come apart, but by some miracle, an epiphany strikes the lead girl and she chooses to be with the lead man, after all.

What sealed the fate of this film being one I regret seeing (despite its Ireland charms), is when the lead characters have to share a room together by the encouragement of an old couple; natives of country they are visiting. Come on, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IN CHASING LIBERTY.

4091497,4,B0038N9X3Q,"Leap Year was a fun movie to watch.  It DOES follow the predictable romantic comedy formula, and there are clichs and cheesy moments.  Some will love that, some will not.  I am in the first camp.  I enjoyed this movie.  I found that the character of Declan was very attractive and likeable in his gruff way.  He had a down to earth quality that reminded me of my husband (who is from Britain and met me here in the U.S. before we got married.  I love the stories where one of the people is from one country and the other from another country, the fish out of water quality and falling in love).  Anna was warm and had a romantic heart, but she was confused and uptight.  She thought certain things in life would make her feel secure that didn't.  She was realizing who she was on this journey as well, though that is more so an internal quality in the movie rather than something that is blatantly expressed to the audience.  I know that the uptight quality is a movie cliche for women, but in this movie I didn't mind it.  I just enjoyed the beautiful scenery and romantic escapism.  I don't want to reveal the story line in reviewing the movie.  If you don't like romantic comedies or the formulaic quality of the plots in many romantic comedies, you would likely despise this movie.  If you like a cute movie with a feel good romantic story to it, and you like sweetness without sizing things up for a cinematic experience or masterpiece, this is the movie for you.  It's a movie you unwind to, not one you expect greatness from in film.  It's definitely not a brilliant movie or impressive in that way, but I think it is successful and fun to watch in the ""feel good cheesy romantic comedy"" category.  There is no sex, no nudity, no violence, and I think the language would be considered pretty tame, if you are concerned with those things.  It's not a movie for young kids, but I think mostly because it might be dull for them, but it's not one as a parent you'd feel you'd have to NOT watch if they're in the room, either.  But keep in mind to enjoy the movie for the cheesy romantic comedy experience it is; the actors do have great chemistry together, the male lead is very attractive, and I like the story (which is definitely unrealistic in the best way).

4091500,4,B0038N9X3Q,"It was a decent movie given the premise, but if you remove Amy Adams and insert a less attractive, less talented female, this movie goes nowhere.  This was a fun movie and is definitely worth your time, just don't expect anything new or to be on pins and needles with the ending; you pretty much know what's going to happen 20 minutes in.

The cliched part of the film is that age-old question ""How can she leave one commitment without seeming like a heartless whore?""  Easy!  Make her current significant other look like an a-hole!  However, the best part of the movie, for me, is when she pulls the fire alarm and just stands in the middle of the room.  I won't ruin the significance of that part for you, but it brought the plot lines together really well.

Beyond this, the movie had a good pace to it, had some pretty good comedic moments, and is ultimately a fun movie you can get into whether you like rom-coms or just like looking at Amy Adams.

This movie, though, is a neat take on the Romantic-comedy principle.  I do enjoy Amy Adams (especially since I saw her harder side in The Fighter), and I find her supporting actors real-seeming and well chosen.  In terms of the plot, only the last couple scenes seemed a little stilted (like they just pushed their dynamic a little too far), but all is made up for by the beautiful Irish-folk cross-section which is presented throughout.  The Landscape is beautiful.  You get a bit of Irish lore, old manners, superstitions, and stereotypes.  Fantastic to behold.  Definitely worth the Blu-ray experience.

This also made it a little difficult to believe she was an uptight, career-minded woman. She's hard not to like. I did not like the chemistry between Anna (Amy Adams) and Declan (Matthew Goode) The whole thing seemed too contrived. I understand the dynamics of fighting and teasing; it sparks attraction, but something was not quite right. Goode ALMOST pulled it off. The one-to-many-teases about Anna's luggage (Louis Vuitton) didn't help. It killed the joke.

Adam Scott did not overdo the terrible boyfriend character Jeremy, as is too often the case in movies (think Bradley Cooper in Wedding Crashers) He did a fine job conveying a mildly romantic, status-oriented doctor. He was vanilla. It was hard to hate him, but still easy to see that he wasn't the right (passionate) guy for Anna.",1367452800,2,889,4.926666666666667

As far as the plot, it was obvious from the get-go that these two were going to end up together...but okay, I can live with that.  But unfortunately the writers gave M.G. nothing to do but trail ten feet behind Amy Adams' character across the width of Ireland. I also did not detect any chemistry between the two main characters - I actually looked M.G. up to see if he was gay (he's married).
The fabulous Irish scenery was the star of this movie for me.  I would have liked to see more info in the credits about where it was filmed.  Also, just a nit-picky detail:  When sailing from Cardiff, Wales to Cork how could you possibly be forced to land on the Dingle peninsula, which is on the far WEST coast of Ireland?? And why would you head for Cork anyway when Dublin is on the northeast coast and Cork is far south?  Get your geography straight, writers!

Thoroughly enjoyable, fun, and engaging with an array of indigent Irish characters and settings.  The starring roles were well acted, the plot actually had some twists so that it is not just a carbon-copy romance, and the ending was (as expected) tear-jerking--but, of course, not tragic!

In accordance with Irish legend, her boyfriend must say ""yes"" if asked by the female to marry on Leap Day.  Along the way, she meets a quiet, handsome Irishman who totally ""gets"" and loves her so much more wholeheartedly than her boyfriend.  Together they have extremely amusing adventures.

Fantastic scenery.",1363392000,,267,4.760869565217392
4091548,3,B0038N9X3Q,"Ok so
There is a lot of unnecessary set up, there's a lot of unnecessary everything which bogs the first half of what could have been a sweet light romantic movie down in the Irish mud. The scene on the plane made the pilot sound like an idiot and seemed like a bit right out of Airplane the movie. Again, unnecessary.

Having watched so much of it made me keep saying eh..I'll give it a few more minutes, I watched this far..the leading mans eyes and sexy accent was a plus. The last scene leaves you with a feel good twist and some amazing scenery if you hang in there for the whole thing.

Things that don't match. When they leave in a car that is abandoned in a lake, she has luggage yet he has nothing but the shirt on his back per se. Yet manages to change his clothes and brush his teeth etc several times throughout their mishap laden travels. Also due to his indebtedness which leads him to drive her because he needs the money so bad, he buys drinks, lends her train fare and when left in Dublin alone has money for a phone call etc..ummm?
Someone missed the edit boat on what could have been a good movie.

In short - Yes it's formulaic, it wasn't badly written, a LOT could have been omitted to lighten the dragging pace.
If you are trolling romantic movie choices, keep it for a last or second to last choice. Or just fast fwd to the last half.",1363132800,,1357,4.211538461538462

At least the movie offers interesting and beautiful Irish scenery and sights.
However, there is little to no chemistry between Amy Adams (Anna) and Matthew Goode (Declan) not to mention sexual tension.
The movie's geography is all messed up -- it is inexplicable how Anna (Amy Adams) takes a boat from Cardiff, Wales to Dublin, Ireland (east coast), but winds up in Dingle, Ireland (southwest coast) -- sort of like going to Philadelphia but winding up in New Orleans.
Go along for the ride on Anna's and Declan's journey, just don't expect much that is new, compelling or touching.",1361923200,3,654,4.954545454545454

It was amusing to see Adams, so in control in the first scenes, come so unraveled and vulnerable as the trip goes on, and the disasters begin to pile -- and then to watch Goode's character grow in kindness and respect.

How wrong was I?

Was the ""comedy"" part of this to rewind the outside perception of Ireland to that of the 1950's? Because how else could someone have thought there was any sense or meaning to the plot in this movie? Or was this on a sarcastic black humour level that I entirely missed?

The one liners and situations they get into are hilarious and they handle each in predictable ways. While it truly is lighthearted, there is a good underlying theme that you will enjoy. While not academy award material, I gave it 4 stars, rather than 5,  only because of the corny, cliche ridden image of Irish ways that only Americans have for the 'old sod'. It was the Irish version of Brigadoon and I expected Leprechans and pots of gold to pop out of the bushes at any time. The story isn't a strong one but it is a delight to watch because of Goode and Adams...they were a good match and played their predictable roles with charm.

The lead character is flying from Boston to Dublin, Ireland but due to bad weather the plane gets diverted to Wales. After that the geography seems a little off -- she somehow charters a boat to Cork (which is much further south) and again due to bad weather she is dumped by the boat in Dingie -- which is even FURTHER south and far around the island of Ireland.

Its also a little hard to believe that the main character, an anal retentive, control everything kind of person, would not better asses her options for getting from Wales to Dublin before setting off on this crazy journey.

So if you can over look these pretty major (I think) issues at the start of the movie, the rest of it is fun but predictable.",1357257600,,783,4.393103448275862

When he doesn't, she follows him to Ireland in order to follow in the footsteps of her grandmother who proposed to her husband on leap year. Leap Year is the one day in Ireland where women may propose to men. Just try to ignore the obvious sexist flaw that a woman should be able to propose to her lover anytime she wants just like a man. Of course, things don't quite go as planned as Anna's arrival in Dublin to meet her boyfriend is delayed, and she meets a handsome Irishman who runs the inn that she lands in.

First off, I'm just going to say that I received this as a Christmas present, and I'm not that into romantic comedies. However, I am a fan of Amy Adams, and I have a passion for all things Irish so I decided to give it a try.

The storyline is a bit sappy and ridiculous, and the plot falls prey to many cliches that plague this genre. I have seen worse though. There are a few funny moments that genuinely made me laugh, and the scenery is gorgeous. Amy Adams is charming and adorable as always, and the lead male is competent. The troubles that the couple encounters are cute if a bit over done.

One flaw that I thought this movie suffered from is that it stereotyped the Irish as rustically charming and overly friendly. If you can get past this though the movie is enjoyable and has its tender moments. The ending is sweet, and there is plenty of eyecandy and scenery to keep the viewer occupied. It's also short, which is unusual for many movies that now may run over two hours. This one clocks in at a little over an hour and a half so even if you don't like it you won't have wasted an entire afternoon on it.",1357084800,2,1728,4.198795180722891

This movie started off weak, and only got weaker.  This girl claims to be strong, in a good place in her life, successful.... And yet, I haven't the slightest idea how she got to that state with the common sense and smarts of a pebble.  Apparently, the money she's mysteriously made as a decorator (doesnt take any kind of credentials or brains) has served her well, and masked her inability to make good life decisions (ie. not handing over your $1000 suitcase to a perfect stranger...and being surprised/pouty when they take it).",1351209600,3,580,4.732673267326732

Unfortunately, her boyfriend is in Ireland for a conference so this doesn't turn out to be so easy. The journey to the alter is an amusing one with incredible scenery.

Amy Adams was both cute and funny. Her character was at times annoying but also likeable. The idea to be the one to propose to the boyfriend showed her as being a 21st century woman. But it also showed her as being silly (going to Ireland to propose the day of leap year).

Matthew Goode. This guy is a dream. Yes I know he's English playing an Irish character. But he did do a good job at it. He played the part really well. His character had a devil-may-care and anti-relationship attitude. I just loved him.

It has just a few creaky moments (i.e the wedding shoe scene), but I LOVED that it didn't have overt sexual behaviour or violence or foul language which seems to mar so movies these days (and has ruined most Jude Law film roles for me -- what a waste of talent there). Amy Adams is charming and Matthew Goode manages to put much naturalness into a role that could have fallen quickly into the stereotypical. Goode manages to keep the romantic lead firmly grounded in a masculine ethos. Leap Year is a film most women will want to enjoy more than once, and most men will find watchable at least once.

4091655,5,B0038N9X3Q,"LOVE this movie. Once again cute girl falls for cute stranger with an accent...typical, yes.. but both Amy Adams and Matthew Goode made it entertaining as their disgust for each other (and each other's culture) blends into the classic ""opposites attract."" Amy Adam's character (""Anna from Boston"") desperately wants to be married and has everything she ever wanted. Going to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend while at a conference hints toward her desperation no matter how hard she denies it. Matthew Goode's character (Declan) has been betrayed by love and needs a few hundred euro to keep his pub going. Role cameras, sit back and enjoy.  Gorgeous cinematography makes the movie easy on the eyes and eager to book a flight to Ireland yourself (it did for me anyway).

4091661,2,B0038N9X3Q,"I personally winced throughout this whole movie yet the person I watched this with liked it alot.  I think that explanation comes from her enjoyment of Hallmark channel movies and Leap year sharing many of the traits of this channel's films.  As she had little misgivings, I think she would have rated this movie a 4 or 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.

My opinion is quite different. I've given this movie two stars because it is technically competent.  My criticism is directed at the script.  The characters do things not because it might be the natural progression from their previous actions or personalities but because there are areas in a typical romantic comedy when they need to happen.

Amy Adams' character was insufferable thanks to the script and her redundant, rattling dialog (I felt like yelling ""We get it, already!"" at the screen) while Goode's nice touches were undone by the same script.  Even the two sections in the script where some background to the two leads seems shoehorned in and rote.  The bulk of John Lithgow's performance can be seen in the deleted scenes and that is for the best as his performance was broad and lent very little to the movie.  Unfortunately the scene of his that did make the cut was just for exposition's sake and could have been cut as well with a little script polish.  And then there are the quaint Irish folk, three of which are there for ""comic relief"" sake only and, like everyone in the script with maybe the exception of Adam Scott's one-note character, come across as fictional characters written by a screenwriter whose only personal experience in writing movies and creating characters comes from years of watching and trying to emulate other romantic comedy movies -- and not doing well at that.

A great example of this is a dinner scene where the couple sit down with an Irish husband and wife and an Italian couple.  After the whole ""lets make believe we are a real couple in love"" bit, the two leads become audience to a disturbingly long (and not a bit funny, IMHO)deep passionate kiss, followed by an even more disturbing prodding by the Irish hosts' incessant (and supposedly funny and quaint?)prodding for the two leads to engage in a passionate kiss.

Everything in this movie can be seen coming a mile away and I found it insulting the screenwriter and director didn't recognize that the audience would.  Strictly cookie-cutter.

I could go on about each scene (and did any viewer NOT know the walk to the castle would result in a missed mode of transport?) but I would bore.  The upshot is, if you are a viewer who needs to see a bit of truth in their movies (that is, truth in situation, character , dialog and emotion), you will likely hate this movie with a passion.  I would put it right up with Jackie Chan's The Spy Next Door in that emotional and contexual truth department.  However, if you can park reality at the door and enjoy a love story that has no basis in reality, then you will enjoy this movie.  There is nothing in this movie that would make me want to see it again for the rest of my life.  If you, like me, enjoy movies set in Ireland, note this: It makes Jeanine Garafalo's(sp) The Matchmaker look authentic by comparison, and that's going a long way.  But atleast that love story could be taken without wincing.  The minute one of the three old Irishmen predicts early in the movie that the two leads will probably kill each other, you'll most likely find yourself loathing the screenwriter and director for even throwing that in there because there's no mistaking the blatant conventions of the romantic comedy this film is following makes that predicition feel like you're being patronized.",1338595200,4,3680,4.664086687306502
4091662,5,B0038N9X3Q,"i love this film, i remember when it first came out in 2010. i never saw it in theaters and i don't recall ever seeing a trailer for the movie, but then when it first came out to dvd i kept seeing it in borders and the cover kept hypnotizing me with the bright green cover so i had to contemplate on whether or not to buy and see if it was good. few months after i still kept seeing the dvd and so finally i bought it on dvd and boy was i amazed! i never really cared for romantic comedies till i actually watched a few in 2009. i still believe that most of them are really bad but there are a few good ones out there like this one. amy adams and matthew goode are an amazing pair. i love matthew's accent in this film (even if you don't know what everything he says sometimes when he murmurs or it's an unfamiliar term with us americans.) and they were smart to make it in ireland i have a long history with the uk and ireland and they couldn't of filmed in a better location. seriously i am obsessed with those islands! watch it. it's funny and romantic and i find that this happens to be my favorite romantic comedy out there, especially in bluray finally started transferring my purchases to bluray the quality is freaking ridiculous (didn't earlier because of the height difference from the dvds and bluray's, i am a little bit OCD when it comes to things like that) buy it it's fantastic!",1338422400,5,1394,4.205223880597015
4091663,3,B0038N9X3Q,"I guess deep inside I am a fan of romcoms hoping that the high art of making  good, funny, memorable romantic comedies would reborn one day in one of the plentiful attempts and that's why I keep watching new movies in this genre that the TV commercials announce as the best and funniest romantic comedy we ever saw.  Not too much luck so far but one keeps hoping.

""Leap Year"" directed by Anand Tucker uses the same exact recipe for romantic comedy as thousands flicks did before it.  A successful professional young woman Anna (Amy Adams) has a proper and perfect boyfriend, Jeremy (Adam Scott),  the cardiologist with whom she is buying the posh apartment in the best Boston area, waits for the proposal with the ring, decides to use Irish Leap Year tradition to propose him instead and finds herself in some Irish country side instead of Dublin where her boyfriend-cardiologist is attending the conference. She employs the services of the young local inn-keeper named Declan (Matthew Goode) to get to Dublin even though she did not like the guy at all thinking of him rude bumpkin redneck - Irish style. He in turn sees her as a typical arrogant airhead American who calls her suitcase by the name (Louis Vuitton that is). He also finds her romantic idea of proposal to her boyfriend on February 29 of the leap year the most stupid thing ever. But she is willing to pay and he desperately needs money to upgrade the inn. So off the go - she in her $600 5 inches hills. Considering that she would have to do a lot of walking since the ""classic"" red little car that Declan offered as the means of transpiration was not very reliable to say the least, you might ask why Anna did not pack a pair of sneakers or comfortable walking shoes in her precious Louis Vuitton luggage? But I assume that walking, limping, stumbling in the high heels and felling on the country muddy roads during never-ending rain is one of the ingredients for the perfect romantic comedy recipe.

Number one rule  in the rom com which sometimes works fine (It did indeed in It Happened One Night) - if the girl and the boy hate each other in the beginning of the film and they are sent to a journey together, they may end up well not hating each other that much in the end. The film creators did not break any of the rules and it is up to us to believe in Ever after.

As predictable as it sounds, ""Leap Year"" is actually a pleasant little movie perhaps because two main characters are funny and likable as played by Amy Adams and Matthew Goode. I liked Goode especially. If I had to choose between him and Anna's materialistic boyfriend Jeremy, there would be no doubt in my mind from the beginning. Declan got charisma and sense of humor that make him irresistible. And he is cute, too. As an Irish travelogue, the movie is not bad at all and pleases the eye with some nice scenery. It is predictable in a cozy, uneventful way but you could have spent 100 minutes much worse - to watch Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist"", for example.",1337126400,14,3004,4.478976234003657

Went to Redbox to rent it for $1.27 and it's not available in GA.  I see why.  I was so enchanted with Amy Adams in ""Enchanted"" that I just wanted to see her in another film.

The Irish accent from the star was very hard to understand and since AMA will not get subtitles, I had no idea what the male lead was saying.  I will still try another Amy Adams film as she is adorable, but this ranked up there with the top five most terrible films I have ever rented and this is saying something because I am a 'movie-olic.'

Anna is on a mission - to propose to her boyfriend who is on a doctor's convention in Ireland. The catch is, she is on a limited time schedule because she wants to do it on Leap Year day, following an age-old Irish tradition where the woman asks for the man's hand in marriage.  She ends up having one laughable setback after another along the way, but despite everything, she's determined to keep plowing forward to reach her boyfriend by the 29th. Very soon after setting foot in Ireland, she meets and hires Declan, the owner of a pub,  who agrees to drive her to Dublin.  The setbacks continue, along with their banter that switches between genuine annoyance with each other and a growing attraction.  One of my favorite scenes is when Ann is excitedly laughing and sharing about proposing on Leap Year and she thinks Declan is laughing along with her about the romance of it all, only to realize that he's not laughing with her, but at her.  There are some other fun characters thrown in, like 3 old-timers who spend the better part of their day hanging out at the pub - they have some great one-liners.

John Lithgow, altho a small part, did fabulous with his usual charming comedic style.

Their adventures are fun. The scenery is beautiful and their encounters with animals and people are funny.  Definitely 5 stars for me, its a keeper and one to watch again. You won't be disappointed.

This is a film I will watch again.  The movie is filmed in Ireland and the scenery is gorgeous, lush, and amatory.  The cast is delightful, and the plot filled with humorous scenes.

Leap year is a romantic comedy about a Anna (Amy Adams) who wants to get married to Jeremy (Adam Scott) her boyfriend of four years.  He, not wishing the commitment, travels to Ireland on business.  She takes her grandfather's advice and also travels to Ireland, where it is rumored that a girl can propose marriage on the 29th of February.

Anna having trouble getting an airline to Dublin, takes alternate travel and lands in Wales.  Desperate for time she hires a boat that, due to a storm, drops her on the beach at a small village on the wrong side of Ireland.

The village is only served by a weekly bus, has no Inn for lodging, and the only business open is a bar.  She meets the handsome bartender, Declan (Matthew Goode), who informs her that the rumored practice is a myth, not a tradition.  And the fun begins.

I do not usually watch romantic movies, but my wife likes them, so I agreed to watch Leap Year with her.  I enjoyed the film.  It is funny, includes brilliant repartee, outstanding scenery, and some decent acting.  I recommend this film.

4091704,5,B0038N9X3Q,"Being Irish myself I was somewhat interested in checking out this rom com with Amy Adams, another excellent reason to see any movie.

So, legend has it that in Ireland a woman can propose to a man on the leap day of a leap year. When an anticipated proposal does not emanate from her doctor boyfriend, Anna hears of this legend and so she has to go to Dublin to propose. Imagine. Dublin.

So, Murphy's Law intervenes, and the flight gets diverted, to Wales, and to make a long story short has to take a really roundabout route to get there in a beat up old Renault 4, with an obnoxious yet somewhat charming Irish guy, who gives her no respect. And Murphy, well, he just keeps getting in the way, and will she even get to Dublin.

But, if you put a woman in a car with a charming Irish guy for any length of time, warm feelings can start to develop. So, things happen they way they do, and it's all done with great humor, the scenery is fantastic, it's like an Irish postcard at times. Amy Adams is amazing, and her costar, Matthew Goode is also excellent.

The one thing I will say is every Hollywood movie about Ireland has the obligatory cows blocking the road scene. It does happen, but come on.

I think you would really enjoy this movie, and I highly recommend it. If you like this type of movie, consider
The Quiet Man (Collector's Edition), with John Wayne and Maureen O Hara, really the classic of its kind, and The Matchmaker with Janeane Garofalo, and most recent Cecelia Ahern's movie P.S. I Love You with Hilary Swank.

For what it is, it succeeds admirably well.  It's a fun, fluffy, romantic comedy with some fun twists.

4091708,4,B0038N9X3Q,"In Webster's Dictionary (if anyone still had a physical dictionary) the DVD cover of LEAP YEAR should be placed right next to the word, ""Cute"".  This is one cute little romance, and Amy Adams is so darn cute she should be a lollipop, and all this. . .cuteness. . .leads to the quaint charm of a tale of woe and love, set in the emerald green hills of a lush Irish countryside.  Rom-coms aren't my cup of joe, but LEAP YEAR was so charming I got past that.

What's exceptional here is the stellar fact the two budding lovebirds are completely and actually likable:  Adams as Anna, a control freak A Type who follows her dud boyfriend to Ireland to propose marriage on Leap Year Day; Matthew Goode as Declan, a spontaneous, rather brooding silent type, who agrees to help Anna get to Dublin to make said proposal.  The only truly annoying character is the stuffy boyfriend (Adam Scott), and he's supposed to be annoying.  As Anna and Declan (such a cool name!) traipse the green countryside they experience one misadventure after another, yet their initial animosity morphs into mutual respect, which morphs into a soul-connecting attraction.  And as they embark on their journey we the viewers are exposed to an exquisite taste of grand Irish culture that is quite the treat.

Go fetch us another bottle of wine, me lassie!

Granted, the plot is totally predictable (please name me a rom-com flick that isn't?), and we get the customary kittens and butterflies ending, but come on.  Watch LEAP YEAR and you'll suddenly find yourself grinning like a mischievous leprechaun.

4091709,5,B0038N9X3Q,"Leap Year is about Ana, an uptight, materialistic, young Bostonian lady, who travels to Ireland to propose to her long time boyfriend who is at a conference in Dublin.  Ana has to travel across the Irish countryside to reach her boyfriend in Dublin.  She hires Declan, a fairly carefree and outspoken Irishman, to drive her there and the trip is full of mishaps.  It is a romantic comedy, with the twist of American angst meeting Irish charm.

It is this trip across Ireland that makes up the main story.  Ana, played by Amy Adams, and Declan, played by Mathew Goode, fight at first, understand each other more in the middle, and finally fall in love at the end.  Across Ireland, they encounter an assortment of people, including misfits, thieves, drunks, absurdly superstitious people, fairly-minded moralistic people, a wedding couple and their party, some regular folks, and so on.  I guess one may say that the people range from the typical brogue to the semi-religious.

The video has an unusual color scheme where the background is usually green and occasionally pink.  I recall a scene where Ana's green eyes were highlighted, along with the green background, making the green colors pop.  I understand the green background as both a reference and a reverence for Ireland, but I was puzzled by the otherworldly looking pink.",1310688000,4,1331,4.928251121076233

4091714,4,B0038N9X3Q,"Your age may very well effect your opinion of this movie.  The attractive ""20-30 something cast"" tries it's best and if you don't know any better........they succeed.

But if you are older than say over 50...you'll soon realize that this is a remake/ripoff of the classic: ""It Happened One Night"" and ""Leap Year"" is a considerable step below that.

Yet, I am still giving it 4 out of 5 stars (and I'm over 60), because I think there are some of us at this age who are still ""young at heart"" and can simply watch a movie on it's own merit.

There will be some who will see stereotypes of the older Irish characters (perhaps justified), but this movie revolves around a ""road trip"" and the merry complications that ensue along the way; as two people get their negative emotions out in the open early, then end up living ""happily ever after"" in the end.

Although there is a considerable amount of time that elapses before this happens, the couple needs time to grow and mature (after all...they're 20-30 somethings)and I'm a 60 something so allow me the latitude please?

Overall, the movie and it's cast don't take themselves too seriously and neither should you.  Go for the ride and enjoy it as entertainment and escapist fare.  I think then.... you'll find it disarming and charming.

And perhaps for those of you who are 50 somethings or older........you may have had a similar experience back in the day?

4091716,3,B0038N9X3Q,"As the movie began, it seemed pretty bland, but it kind of grew on me. And the combination of Amy Adams, Matthew Goode, the gorgeous backdrop of Ireland, and real Irish actors, made up for a formula script and direction.  I think it would be pretty hard to resist being drawn in by the gorgeous countryside, and the charm of a real Irish brogue.

Also, this is another film that shows how good actors can make up for a lot.  Sometimes I watch a movie, and try to tell if the problem is the acting, the writing and direction, or both.  In this case, you could see Adams and Goode were making the most of the script, with solid acting and great chemistry.

Amy Adams is perfectly cast as Anna, the prissy Bostonian of ""Shanty Irish"" decent, who decides to follow her cardiologist boyfriend, attending a conference in Dublin, to take advantage of the Irish tradition allowing a girl to propose on February 29th.

She has created the perfect life on the surface. Her relationship with her cardiologist boyfriend also seems perfect. Even when he breaks her heart by giving her earrings, and not the ring she was expecting, you don't hate him.  He's not a cheating louse, or even unkind.  He is just a rather superficial, obtuse physician,

But when she meets Matthew Goode, the caustic Irish pub owner, everything changes. A bitter, woman-hater, after his fiance ran off with his best friend, and business partner, he takes every opportunity to needle her about her idea to propose to her boyfriend, when he agrees to drive her to Dublin after a storm grounds her plane, and he needs the money to save his ailing pub.

I'd watch the movie several times just to see the last scene, and Matthew Goode!",1304726400,,1694,4.598006644518272

Then it was on HBO and I watched it two or three more times.  I absolutely fell in love with it.  Why?  First of all...there was romance not just sex(in fact you CAN watch this with your kids).  It is truly magical.

The script is funny, sassy at times and the Irish accent makes my heart beat faster.  The chemistry builds and you can see that love grew as they started to see the other for who they really were...their true character and not just the images they attempted to put forth.  The wedding toast is my favorite quote from the movie...and somehow, the fact they are in attendance at a wedding where they know no one seems so believably Irish.  It is worth purchasing because every time you watch it...you see a little more into the characters portrayed so well by the actors.  This is one to fall in love with over and over.

It would make a great Mother's Day gift, Valentine's or even just for date night.  You can own if for less than a trip to the theater.",1303430400,,1089,4.284313725490196

4091722,2,B0038N9X3Q,"First off, like the actors, love ireland, but the script was a terrible let down.  I really wanted to like this but ended up feeling like this film was trying to be comedic and serious without doing a sufficient job of either.  The two main characters are people with problems that prevent them from finding happiness.  This would would have been plenty to start with but the script ended up forcing slapstick moments on them that, truth be told, were not that funny.

There were glimpses of depth but never enough to support the full load of the story.  Anna (main female lead) has been with a man for four years and the most she can say about him is that he's a cardiologist (but she seems oblivious to the fact that the man has no actual heart himself).  No real reason why she has stuck with him for so long in a relationship that seems more a business merger than actual love.  The only reason I could see was her almost pathological need for predictability.

Declan, the male lead, has been soured in love which accounts for his surly attitude but rarely displays any open tenderness towards Anna.  There's more passion between them than between Anna and her cardiologist but I kept feeling that the two of them would have their work cut out for them to make a future together.

The ""comedic"" moments were just painful.  Had the writers spared that or even just reined them in a little it would have been better.  As it was all I felt was humiliation for the main characters.

I did like the ending in that both were taking a leap of faith towards each other.  But it wasn't enough to salvage all that had gone before.

4091723,1,B0038N9X3Q,"Some films just look back from the get-go.  You see the trailer and it's littered with horrible clich&eacute;s and complete rip-offs from other films and you know that nothing about the film could redeem its unapologetic take at complete and total unoriginality.  `Leap Year' was one of those movies.  From the first few moments of the `all too familiar' trailer, I saw every other romantic comedy made in the past decade or more.  Even the runaway car was a disgusting attempt to capitalize on that one slice of slapstick nostalgia we see redone and redone time and time again.  I still don't know why I saw this film, but I blame it solely on the wife and the fact that the conundrum that is Amy Adams continues to haunt me.  I mean, is she a good actress?  I ask this only because she is either outstanding (`Junebug') or horrifically mediocre (`Julie and Julia').  Here, she shows enough charm to scrounge her way through the task of allowing an unattractive man to take her to Ireland so she can propose to her even uglier boyfriend (who looks like a lesbian).  There was a moment, after their kiss (the one they are forced into) where she exhibits a depth of character the screenplay doesn't allow her, but it was minor.  I love her though and will continue to.  She has far more hits than misses, that's for sure.  Alas, this film is probably her worst.  It is laboriously underdeveloped and it doesn't care that all of its best moments are stolen from `the best of the worst' in this genre.  Just put it down and walk away.",1300924800,2,1531,4.52

4091726,5,B0038N9X3Q,"You know after viewing Spartacus both Blood & Sand and Gods of the Arena - gladiators, blood, gore, orgies, et al, then on to The Tudors, well, I needed to wind down a bit, so I happened upon Leap Year, and I'm so glad that I did.  It was very entertaining, refreshing and delightful. Ireland is quite beautiful. I have to tell you, I loved this film. It was as enchanting as its main actors, beautiful and delightful Amy Adams, and sexy and surly Matthew Goode. I'd like to mention, too, that I enjoyed all the actors, including the townspeople from the various villages of Ireland. They were natural and seemed very friendly and genuine. I always check out the extras in the background to see if they are in sync with the actors and/or the script. The author and director knew what they were doing in this film. I had been following Amy Adams' career since Enchanted and find her to be a class act. She is a credit to her profession, and a shining star. I hope her light never goes out. Matthew Goode surprised me. I saw him in Brideshead Revisited and was very impressed with his performance. He is tall, kinda' lanky, beardless in that film. In Leap Year he has a beard, (a go-tee would have been sexier), and seemed to have had a few more pounds on him, which was a plus for this dude.  He looked awesome. I loved his character - Declan.  He was funny, rude, gruff, playful, compassionate, and sexy. He was Anna's protector. Her superman, so to speak. She was beautiful, sophisticated, classy, materialistic but somehow Declan made her see the light. They seemed good for each other. She was always in control in the states, until Ireland.  I loved Amy's character, Anna. She's in 3-inch heels throughout the entire movie. I know ""Louie the luggage"" should have had 1 pair of sneakers or flat shoes in there somewhere, but that's make believe for ya'! I enjoyed this movie so much that I recently ordered a couple as gifts and one for me, naturally. Critics mean well and they have a job to do, but just ask us fans what we think and we'll tell you exactly what's on our minds. Everyone has a right to his/her opinion but so often the critics don't hit the mark. Thank God for cable. Leap Year was a breath of fresh air, and it had me laughing throughout the movie, plus the writer had me wondering how the ending would turn out because he manages to sidetrack us. Smart move! Bravo to the author and to the director! You won't be disappointed. I saw a movie back in 1997, with Janeane Garofalo and David O'Hara entitled, The Matchmaker, which also takes place in Ireland, and I really enjoyed it, but not as much as I enjoyed Leap Year. Leap Year was an adventure. No disrespect to the writer, but I would have changed a few things in the storyline--more affection and passion between Goode and Adams.  They were a beautiful couple.  Not once did Anna and Declan verbally use the words, ""I love you,"" but they didn't have to; they said it all with their very beautiful and expressive eyes. I'd like to see those two work together again, perhaps in a suspense/thriller/action movie or even a series like a 21st century The Thin Man (remember the old flicks with William Powell and Myrna Loy back in the 30's) or another husband and wife team, Hart to Hart.  Who knows?  Adams and Goode seem to have chemistry but somebody was holding back a bit.  Although, Also, in one of the scenes the most passionate kiss was that of the Italian couple. When Matthew Goode turns 40, I think h should be considered for James Bond. He's certainly tall, dark and handsome.  He needs to bulk up a bit, tho. Nevertheless, don't knock Leap Year. There are inconsistencies and whatnot, but overall it's a wonderful film. If you want to unwind and get romantic, this is the movie for you. Adam Scott was wonderful as Jeremy and in one of his interviews he is very complimentary of Amy Adams. What a gentleman! He is so sweet--very confident and a wonderful actor.

4091734,1,B0038N9X3Q,"This movie was so boring, trite and predictable that I actually could not finish it - and I always make it a point to finish a movie, no matter how bad. But this overdid it and was SO LOUSY. Seriously. It follows the cookie-cutter recipe of girl trying to get to a city/person but her travel plans are interrupted due to ""unforeseeable circumstances"" and she has to rely on some good looking, rough-on-the-outside, chocolate-covered-candy-on-the-inside hunk with a ""sensitive heart"" who treats her like crap, to get to her destination. All with the obligatory falling face-down into the mud stuff and having your luggage stolen to sleeping in a cozy hotel where she gets to wear a nice outfit and sweep him off his feet at the dance the same night. It was great in ""Romancing the Stone"" but it is kind of lame and unoriginal in this one, as there is no comedy here and the two main characters don't have an ounce of chemistry between them. Everything is absurd and obviously set up to illicit laughs, like Adams' character continuing to walk around in high heels on dirt roads - even though at that point she still had her luggage on her and could easily have changed to comfortable shoes. But I guess if your script and ""comedy"" rely on her dragging her heels through dirt, cause it's supposed to be so funny, you cant have the character be sensible or have common sense.

Every scene is cliche and predictable and Amy Adams has a boring personality. The supposed heart-warming comedy and romance consists of scenes like Goode (main male character) actually ripping off the head of a chicken in front of her (literally rip off) and then they are seen five minutes later having a candle-light dinner over that. ""Coq au Vin and vino after the slaughter"". How truly romantic. I do eat chicken, but I don't cozy up with it first and then rip its head off to devour. Totally inappropriate and tasteless.

This movie is filled with junk like that. Not only do the characters not have any chemistry between them but they also themselves lack dimension. I loved Romancing the Stone and ""Moonlighting"" - you know, where there is some kind of antagonism between the two main characters and the way they come closer after a lot of obstacles, but in this movie it was just fake and forced. They seriously miscasted and I could not believe how truly boring and unimaginative it was. Rom-com doesnt mean predictable, stupid and boring.  I could predict what was going to happen in _every frame_ -  that's how lame it was.

I give it one star (it didn't deserve any) because of the gorgeous Irish landscape. Other than that I recommend looking out of the window instead of at this movie, cause chances are what you see happening out there is far more interesting and enticing than this comatose piece of crap with unlikable, dumb characters.",1295827200,6,2827,4.668674698795181

4091737,5,B0038N9X3Q,"If you are a romantic, this is one on the best genre movies of its type in recent years.

The casting is superb with Ms. Adams looking every bit the idyllic Irish lass.  Matthew Goode is convincing in the role as Declan O'Callaghan.  Jeremy (Adam Scott), shown as the detached fiancee who is impeccably dressed (are those Paul Stuart suits he's wearing?), completes the stellar cast.

Aside from the scenery there is the music (see my review of Gwyneth Herbert's ""Bittersweet and Blue"" CD which contains the song from the movie ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"".  Once you've watched the movie, you may wish to purchase the soundtrack but be aware that the vocal music from the movie is not on the soundtrack.

Staging is a term often used in the movie and there is no better staging than in the bedroom scene with Anna and Declan - however unlikely.  (Could you pass that test)?  When shown with no dialogue and with the accompanying song by Mama Cass, it rises to one of the most powerful scenes in the movie.  It reminded me of the magnetic attraction between Mary (Donna Reed) and George (Jimmy Stewart) in the phone scene from ""Its A Wonderful Life.""  Or the classic scene in Casablanca showing Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) reminiscing about her time with Rick in Paris.  She tells Sam to sing ""As Time Goes By.""  The close-up on Ms. Berman's face (which lasted an incredible 25 solid seconds), is one of the most powerful emotional displays of a lost love ever put on film.  So too is the bedroom scene in Leap Year.

Good writing is abundant in the film.  Who can forget the line, ""Always kiss as if it's the first time...and the last time?""  Or the tit-for-tat dialogue between Declan and Anna on the bridge in Dublin.  There is an attraction between the two which has been building throughout the movie, and nears a climax with this exchange:  Declan asks Anna, ""It has nothing to do with me.  I'm just the old bag carrier around here. Why should I care?""  To which Anna coyly asks, ""So you don't?""  Declan: ""Would it make a difference?""  Anna is surprised at the question and does not have a come-back line...just a smile and a realization that the dye is cast regarding her true feelings for Declan.

A well produced and acted movie for the true romantics of the world.

Nailed the part. Script was very well written, great dialogue and romantic banter between the two. Without giving any of the plot away, I was fooled several times thinking it would be predictable. Nope. Which is just another reason why this is an excellent film. And then there's the beautiful photography of rural ireland. Wow! I'm gonna buy the blue-ray just for that. And also because it's just a nice, fun, and well-made film. The fact that the actors are not big names probably makes it better, more authentic, and allows it to take some chances and avoid the usual pitfalls for movies like this.

Ultimately, what makes a rom-com like this good is if the leads are believable.  And these two have chemistry in spades.  Amy Adams makes what could have been an essentially unlikable character sweet and vulnerable, and Matthew Goode is a revelation as the scruffy, charming Irish pub owner.  The script isn't terribly clever, but these two actors wring the most out of it by playing the subtext with subtle gestures and looks.  I was actually disappointed when this one ended.  I will say that the one thing that really bothered me was that the movie is supposed to take place during the last week in February in Ireland, and the character go around in sundresses and shirtsleeves like it's spring.

4091746,2,B0038N9X3Q,"Amy Adams is a home stager who is about to move in with her doctor boyfriend of four years. Ready to take the leap - she travels to Ireland hopefully in time to ask her boyfriend to marry her on February 29 (leap year day). Of course nothing goes as planned, and she has plenty of roadblocks along the way that threaten to thwart her plans, including a surly Irish tour guide and cows galore.

This movie sounds like it might be a refreshing change of pace romantic comedy, but there is plenty of ""been there, seen that"" moments to give viewers a sense of deja vu.  I felt like I was watching a romanticized version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planes-Trains-and-Automobiles-Those-Aren-t-Pillows-Edition/dp/B002JIOOAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planes, Trains and Automobiles (Those Aren't Pillows Edition)</a>"" and not a good one at that.  There is little chemistry between the two leads, and even less between Amy and her long-term boyfriend. The entire story is a bit tedious and the only thing that kept me glued (other than the hope that things might get better) was the Irish countryside (though all Irish characters were a bit stereotypical).

I know that this is nit picky, but I am so tired of watching movies and television shows in which heroines travel internationally and wear impractical $600 stilettos that inevitably get muddied, soaking wet, or trudged through animal feces when the heroine eventually finds herself having to walk.  When I see one of these such travelers in an airport, I pray that they are seated behind me and the emergency life boat so they won't deflate it.

A much more believable and enjoyable fish out of water tale set in Ireland is ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matchmaker/dp/B0000714BW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matchmaker</a>"" starring Janeane Garofalo as a cynical Boston political consultant stuck in a small Irish town during a matchmaking festival.",1291075200,6,1984,5.531353135313531
4091747,4,B0038N9X3Q,"This is one of those movies that you throw in for a quick pick me up. Lets say after a bad day/bad date. It's just a cute romcom. (Spoilers ahead) Anna follows her boyfriend(Jeremy) of 4 years to Dublin after not receiving an engament ring on their anniversary. Irish tradition states that on a leap year on Febuary 29th a women can propose. So all set out to get her man one obstacle after another arises. It just seems like fate has different plans. Upon arriving in a small town Anna meets Declan the locale bar keep/taxi service. He agrees to drive her to Dublin but things just keep going wrong from wrecking the car to missing their train. Dublin + Jeremy seem to be harder to get to then first thought while Declan is right in front of her. Getting caught in the rain, crashing a wedding and having to play married couple to get a room at the inn make for cute romcom moments, all w/ the beautiful irish courtyside as the backdrop. Yes they are expected and predictable but they are sweet none the less. On arrival in Dublin Jeremy ""moved"" by Anna's actions proposes to her. Cut to an empty space in the room where Declan used to be standing. Jump to Anna + Jeremy's engagment party where you learn the only reason Jeremy proposed was beacuse the landlords would only rent to a married couple. This just justifies the doubts you can tell Anna was having. Anna returns to Declan + proposes that they not make plans + just see where things lead. Declan turns and walks away w/o a word. Thinking she's been rejecting Anna heads out to overlook the ocean where Declan mets her + proposes w/ his mothers ring.(How sweet!) Of course she says yes who wouldn't he's gorgeous and that accent (oh that accent)and after she flew 3000 miles to see him. Although you totally knew from the beginning that they'd end up together watching the journey was still worth it. Give this one a look see if you're having a love sucks day or just a blah day in general. Everyone needs a feel good movie now + again so give this one a try.",1290988800,,2020,4.389333333333333

To me the movie is very enjoyable, something I would recommend young girls to watch because it's clean and romantic.  I watched it with my daughter. She liked Amy's character because she's gutsy.

4091750,4,B0038N9X3Q,"Okay, so let me start out by saying that I usually like any movie with Amy Adams in it. She's such a good actress and always holds my attention for the entire length of the movie. That is not something I say about most actors and actresses. I definitely rate this as one of my favorite movies for this year. I am somewhat of a sucker for a good, romantic comedy, which is what this is in a nutshell. The landscape is just stunningly breathtaking while they are in Ireland. It really seemed like Amy Adams and Matthew Goode had good chemistry with one another. I know that if I get emotionally involved with one or more of the characters, the director and everyone else involved must have done something right. There isn't anything inappropriate shown in this movie, although there is one scene where an animal is killed in order to cook it for dinner (they don't actually show the animal being killed). I wouldn't necessarily call this movie a laugh-out-loud type of comedy. In other words, you will probably find yourself laughing more to yourself than anything else for little moments that occur throughout the movie. It's really a good movie to watch in almost any occasion, except if you don't want to see a movie about two complete strangers falling in love.",1289952000,7,1263,4.6177777777777775
4091751,1,B0038N9X3Q,"I got this movie on a whim that Amy Adams is generally adorable and the premises seemed sweet. After viewing it I find it incredible funny and ironic that the main review states it's a ""Delightful, relatable romantic comedy."" In the end there was very little romance OR comedy, and it certainly wasn't relatable!!

While I realize this movie is classified as a Rom-Com I was hoping for something less predictable and I was definitely expecting the main characters to have some kind of chemistry. In the end, Amy's character spent the whole movie trying to find her boyfriend of 4 years to propose to him, while this deplorable jackass she hires to get her to Dublin (where the bf is staying) berates her and puts her through a nightmare of things. They are constantly arguing, fighting, and at once point she yells at him that she hates him. There is absolutely NO chemistry between Amy Adams and Matthew Goode (the cab driver/pub owner taking her to Dublin). While this movie is only a little more than 90 minutes long, I felt like I was watching something more the length of Avatar or Titanic. Boring and painful to get thought...

***Spoiler Alert Below**
With that said, I'd like to point out that in the movie Amy's character has been with her boyfriend for 4 years and he's a handsome, charming doctor. Yes, he can't spend all his time fawning all over her, he's a doctor for crying out loud. But we also don't get to see the beginning of the relationship and how things progressed. He's wealthy, smart, handsome and in the end she dumps him for the broke pub owner and moves to Ireland. Who does that? No one, that's who. Skip this movie unless you're a masochist.

It's obvious antecedents are ""It Happened One Night"" with a dash of ""The Quiet Man"" thrown in.  Yes, it's formula rom-com but it works.

Mind you, I had just watched 'When in Rome' which let me down, so I was hoping that 'Leap Year' would satisfy. It didn't.

First, the scenery is gorgeous. I don't have family or any connections to Ireland, but I'm a sucker for the beautiful outdoors. I could have watched the imagery for the whole movie. I give two stars to that alone.

The movie I found to just be blah. I really like AA, but I didn't find her or the guy charming in this movie. When you watch a romcom, since the story is mostly predictable, it takes the chemistry and charm of the leads to make it work. I was hoping for the charm she had w/Patrick Dempsey or the guy from 'Miss Pettigrew,' but it never happened for me. The lead guy was attractive enough, but his character was too crabby to be appealing. Since I'd never seen the actor before, I didn't know if that was the character or him. Just so happens that I read an interview w/the actor where he thought the movie stunk but he did it bc of the pay/location. Guess I wasn't feeling him bc he also wasn't feeling the script.

Not going to rehash the plot bc I'm sure some of the reviews did that, and quite honestly, after the hour mark, I started splitting my attention btwn the movie and other things. This could have easily been a movie on Lifetime or Hallmark and it would have cost a lot less to produce. I so wanted to like it.",1284854400,,1528,4.208191126279863

I only hope others viewing it notice all the special qualitites the cast conveys.

But this genre of love-story/comedy is not only over-done -- but has been done much better. Stick-up-her-caboose control freak heroine thinks she wants to be married to her rich cardiologist long-term, live-in doting-but-unromantic boyfriend -- but instead falls in love with the emo-broken-hearted-rude-mocking-but-still-kind-hearted-on-the-inside-hot bar keeper.  There was poor character & story development---the denouement was rushed and unexplained. The love-interest bar-keeper went from being on the cusp of losing his pub/inn in a tiny town with no buses/trains/few residents/reliable electricity to suddenly having a pub/restaurant that's PACKED with loyal patrons who empty their pockets to allow him to repay his loan (or something like that I guess...details details, so inconvenient!)

Then suddenly they are kissing passionately in front of a breath-taking cliff-overlooking the ocean view.

Leap Year is refreshingly entertaining. The scenes from Ireland are amazing. The lore of the story is appealing to anyone with a heart. Amy Adams and Matthew Goode are a fantastic pairing for this story.

4091780,4,B0038N9X3Q,"I am not generally a big fan of traditional romantic comedies but Anand Tucker's Leap Year was surprisingly watchable. True all the trappings of the traditional story are present but Leap Year managed to present these ideas in a fresh way.

Anna Brady (Amy Adams) is tired of waiting for her doctor boyfriend of four years to propose to her so she takes matters into her own hands by following him to Ireland to propose to him on Leap Day. When bad weather forces her to find other means to get across Ireland to Dublin to meet him the fun begins. Stranded in a remote village she enlists the help of Declan (Matthew Goode) to drive her to the city. Along the way the two develop a very good chemistry and love begins to bloom.

A big character in this film is Ireland itself and the photography by Newton Thomas Sigel shows off the country in all its craggy green beauty. Perhaps the best thing about the film is that it doesn't beat its viewer over the head with convention. The film is surprisingly well written and intelligent even as it sometimes verges into basic silliness. A slight issue the lack of any substantial extr features on the Blu Ray disc. All that is presented are a series of deleted scenes that basically flesh out the relationship of Anna with her father played by John Lithgow whose part was shortened for what could only have been time restraints.

All in all this is a very well made date night movie. While it is probably a rental for most it is well worth seeing for the beautiful photography and the chemistry between its stars.",1280275200,2,1557,4.4946996466431095

4091782,4,B0038N9X3Q,"With the likes of ""Enchanted"" and ""Julie & Julia"" under her belt, Amy Adams is fast becoming this decades Meg Ryan.  How can you not love the exuberant, giddy, forever smiling redhead who brings flashes of Lucille Ball while making the world fall in love.  I now seem to watch more romantic comedies than I do horror films, and with all the women in my house, that probably won't be changing for a long time.  I guess I am lucky enough to enjoy most of them and ""Leap Year"" was no exception.  Another trip down lover's lane in a typical boy meets girl, boy likes girl, girl proposes to the wrong dude but gains her senses and, well, happily ever after.

Amy Adams is a jet setting young socialite who stages houses for a living.  She does things like place a couch under a window, drop cookies in the oven, etc.  All in an effort to sell the next condo to that up and coming couple.  She is meticulous, has her life all planned out and is about to marry a doctor.  Nothing against doctors but what woman really wants to marry one.  They have horrible hours, are constantly on call, miss all the important family outings and rumor has it they tend to hook up with nurses.  Ok, I just made that last part up, but it sounds logical.  Nurses are pretty darn cute in those little white outfits.

So Amy gets tired of waiting for her perfect man to propose and since he is on a trip to Ireland gets the bright idea of asking the big question herself.  I guess there is some Irish tradition that allows the women to propose on the 29th of February.  Now I am all about equal opportunity, but don't most women want the man to propose.  Isn't it all about the romance and stuff.  Anyway, she follows him over to the island and, yes, you guessed it, things go all haywire and she ends up meeting Mathew Goode who embodies all that is not a doctor.

He runs a local bar/restaurant, is fighting to keep it from being repossessed and hangs out most of the day serving up alcohol to the old cronies.  Mathew gives his best effort in helping Amy get back to Dublin where her perfect man awaits and along the road, you guessed it, things go haywire.  I think the moral of all these romantic comedies is, to find happiness you must first have some crazy, yes even pretty hilarious things happen.  Without the bizarre antics you are just left with everyday life, and what fun is that.

I enjoyed ""Leap Year"".  It wasn't the best movie I have seen and I didn't always feel a connection between Amy and Mathew but there were several funny scenes.  Let's face facts as well.  Ireland is beautiful and Amy Adams lights up the screen with her smile and energetic fun filled personality.  If she isn't this generations Meg Ryan then I have no idea which way is up.

But this is unwatchable, and after 45 minutes I accepted defeat and turned it off.

The characters are boring.  Their situation is boring. The protagonists are supposed to be unappealing in the beginning because their relationship together is supposed to grow from conflict to co-operation to charismatic romance, but everything is working against this. The dialogue is inane. The Irish locals are nasty rednecks. Ireland, a truly beautiful country, looks dull!

If 'Leap Year' transcends all these flaws and polishes into a beautiful diamond in the second half then I apologise for not being able to endure the journey.",1279497600,5,850,5.13768115942029

4091790,4,B0038N9X3Q,"I did a rental of this flick on Blu-ray recently so I could watch it with my daughter.  The one thing (beside the knowledge that Amy Adams starred) I knew in advance was that this wasn't a Nicholas Sparks film.  That was enough to entice me to at least give the film a try. ;-)

Seriously, this film is the anti-Nicholas Sparks film.  Sure it may be just as predictable and just as romantic (or at least it tries to be), but it doesn't rip out the heart of the viewer/reader in the way Sparks *always* does.  Is this film perhaps a bit boring because of this?  Well, no, not really.  It offers the lovely and perky Amy Adams as she, and others around her, suffer through various mishaps while she's on her way to force the issue with her mate of the last 4 years.  4 long years without a proposal.

Adams takes flight to Ireland to take advantage of an old Irish tradition of having the woman propose to the man on Leap day, February 29th.  Why that particular day rather than any other day is a question that we don't get to ask.  If we did, well then we'd likely not get this film, or at least wouldn't have the title and main plot point to revolve around.  Regardless, apparently Adams' character (Anna) isn't interested enough in womens liberation to just pop the question without the need to travel or pick a special day, so travel she does and from there we, the viewers, get the pleasure of watching a journey that would remind viewers old enough to remember the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planes-Trains-and-Automobiles-Those-Aren-t-Pillows-Edition/dp/B002JIOOAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planes, Trains and Automobiles (Those Aren't Pillows Edition)</a>&nbsp;of that journey.

Relatively early on in the journey Anna meets Declan (Matthew Goode) and contracts his services to get to her final destination, Dublin, Ireland.  Predictably the two wind up growing close as they travel and the seeds of a romance are sewn even as Anna frets over getting to Dublin on time to seek the hand of her boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott).

Yes the film is predictable, but then again, not in the ways that a viewer/reader would find in a Sparks written/inspired film.  The basics are predictable here, but even as we might grow to predict and expect a certain result, that's not necessarily what is delivered.  Instead we get to think a bit more and are drawn a bit further along in the story as we hope for a certain result but wonder whether or not it will come to pass.

The acting here is good, the story is entertaining, and the scenery is very nice (and impressive) though the color pallete is a bit more constrained than say that used in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life-in-Ruins-Blu-ray/dp/B0021L8UOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life in Ruins [Blu-ray</a>] (a film where the scenery pretty much becomes the star of the film) or another film that also features some lovely Irish scenery&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/P-S-I-Love-You-Blu-ray/dp/B0015GDVTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">P.S.

And of coarse they ""hate"" each other. Righhht. And yada, yada, yada opposites attract and they get feelings for each other.  Sound familiar?

So basically this movie is predictable at least as far as the overall plot is concerned.  It's you're basic romantic comedy movie that was obviously written by a guy as most of these types of movies are.  Or if women were on the writing staff, they obviously didn't put as much into the script as the males did. Hints to this are:

1. The coarse and a-holish male lead who at this point is still a stranger gets to walk in on the woman while she's in her underwear; he ignores her demands to exit the room while she's changing and she finds this behavior 'charming.'

2. The female lead is of coarse proper and neat, and full of manners & always prepared because that's the way girls are... and the male lead is dirty, rough & mean because that's the way guys are.

3. The male lead gets to act like an a-hole (but he has an excuse because his girlfriend left him) and allows her luggage to be stolen by people he knows to be thieves...but then after he's had his laughs with that, he decides to get into a bar fight with them to get the stuff back and she finds this ""impressive.""

4. Female lead walks all over ireland including up a steep hill towards an irish castle in 4 inch heels and the tinge of pain never flashes across her face.  Even though the little miss perfect type would wear heels like that, there would be blood after walking all day in those on hard ground and then walking up a hill.  That was just too much.

So what's good about this movie?  Well quite frankly the female lead.  Don't know her name, but she is superb in her role and she really makes the entire movie. Seriously.  Without her I really think this film would've been quite boring given how predictable and average the script is.  The costume design is also great.  Really brought out the characters.  The actress does wonders for this boring overdone script & she is the reason to watch this movie.",1276387200,6,2257,4.490196078431373

So it is quite surprising to watch a romantic comedy in which she stars where I end up not liking her character and in the process find myself less enthralled with the idea of visiting the Emerald Isle of Ireland.  Adams plays Anna Brady, who spends her days staging apartments so that their sellers will find buyers, and her nights waiting for her boy friend, Jeremy (Adam Scott), a hot-shot heart surgeon, to finally pop the question.  After all, it has been four years and if they are going to move into a luxury townhouse together can the marital question be far behind?  Apparently not, and since Jeremy has a medical conference in Dublin, Anna's dad (John Lithgow) has a convenient family legend regarding women in Ireland asking men to marry them on leap year, and it is a leap year (I presume 2008), our heroine jets across the pond to take advantage of the situation.  That situation is immediately complicated when the jet is forced down in Wales rather than Ireland and Anna has trouble getting transportation to Ireland in general and Dublin in particular.  Along this troubled way Anna comes across Declan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matthew-Goode/dp/B000BQ5J2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matthew Goode</a>), who runs an inn and agrees, for a price, to drive Anna in his ""taxi.""

At this point, even if you have not seen a trailer for the film, you know that fate and the screenplay by Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont (who also had a hand in doing the script for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Made-of-Honor/dp/B001AKTZW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Made of Honor</a>""), are going to have Anna end up with Declan rather than Jeremy (although I was actually holding out hope for more of a twist in the end like with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Best-Friend-s-Wedding/dp/B00005JG6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Best Friend's Wedding</a>"" and that Anna would do exactly what she set out to do).  When the plot is pretty much phoned in from the beginning it is hard to fault the actors for being incapable of making the proceedings much better.  Besides the obvious fact that the two lead characters are supposed to fall in love there is no clear motivation for either one of them to do so.  If anything, between her penchant for property damage and his caustic comments (even with the brogue), there are clear reasons for each to want to be quits with the other as quick as possible.  But they are required to end up together, so that is what director Anand Tucker (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hilary-and-Jackie/dp/6305447233/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hilary and Jackie</a>"") provides.

There is the Irish scenery to enjoy and a mild collection of colorful Irish characters, none of whom are memorable, at least not by the high standards set by ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quiet-Man/dp/B00006JMRD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quiet Man</a>.""  But since I was not enjoying the characters or the plot, it is hard to recommend the film just on the basis of the pretty background, especially when there is an old stone church in the rain, which just begs for John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara to show up instead of Anna and Declan.  There is also the implicit moral that love is more important than a job, at least the job of staging apartments, although it the current housing market Anna's profession might not strike audiences as being as vacuous as the film's conclusion suggests.  My criteria for judging romantic comedies usually requires either an appropriate ""big gesture"" on the part of one of the parties, usually the guy, or at least a heartfelt declaration.  Movie romances tend way more towards the latter (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jerry-Maguire/dp/0800141741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jerry Maguire</a>"") than the former (e.g., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Actually/dp/B00005JMFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Actually</a>""), but either way it requires more than just showing up, which is all this movie offers in the end.",1276387200,,4536,6.0093023255813955

4091796,4,B0038N9X3Q,"LEAP YEAR

STARRING: Amy Adams, Matthew Goode, Adam Scott, John Lithgow and Noel O'Donovan

WRITTEN BY: Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont

DIRECTED BY: Anand Tucker

Rated: PG
Genre: Romantic Comedy
Release Date: 08 January 2010
Review Date: 26 May 2010

When Leap Year slid past me in the theaters from doing so horribly at the box office and being plagued by rumors that it was horrible; I wasn't all that let down that I missed it on the big screen. Having recently seen it on video, I was shocked at how amazing it was and wished I had gotten the opportunity to catch it in theaters.

The sensational Amy Adams stars as Ann; a woman so many women can relate to: she's dating a guy who may never commit. Her boyfriend of quite some time, Jeremy (Adam Scott) is far too consumed with bettering his career to even stop and consider marriage - let alone actually pop the question.

When Jeremy rushes off to Ireland for a career opportunity, Ana is left alone wishing there was something she could do. Upon hearing about an Irish tradition, she realizes there is something she can do. She can fly to Ireland and propose to Jeremy herself, as each leap year allots for this to be customary there.

If you are at all like me, you are already skeptical by the premise and if you've seen the trailer, it only adds to such skepticism. However, the film works magic with its weak supposition and the trailer fails to provide it with any solitude.

Ana had no idea just how difficult it would be to track Jeremy down. Between being caught in nasty storms, missing trains and being barricaded by a heard of wild animals, it seems she may never reach her love. All is not lost though, as she is accompanied on these miss-adventures by her unbeknownst to her true, true love, Declan, played by Matthew Goode.

The two can't stand each other for the majority of the film, but we can see their underlying chemistry behind all their bickering. Soon enough, having shared a few moments, and after they let their guard down to one another, they will see it too.

Leap Year was written by the team who crafted such hits as Made of Honor and Can't Hardly Wait. And it has some of the best cinematography of the year, displaying magnificent shots of the Irish countryside that will have you booking a flight there during the movie.

This is the kind of film that evokes thoughts of fate and as a huge advocate for fate, I find this refreshing in films. If you've ever been touched by destiny in your life, then you know exactly what I am talking about. Sometimes we kick and scream at the sight of the path we find ourselves on, only to realize later, and sometimes much, much later, that it is in fact the path we prefer.",1276214400,74,2702,4.45841784989858

She has a quirky awkwardness about her that never seems to work. Some actresses have this genre down packed (Kate Hudson-Katherine Heigl) and some never will. I felt sorry for Matthew Goode because his performace was actually pretty good. Sorry, this film is not very entertaining.

This particular version of the story is not a whole lot different than most, other than in the setting which happens to be Ireland. That being said, it's still not a bad little movie. I'm giving it four stars because the chemistry isn't terribly great, the characters aren't terribly memorable and there's nothing terribly fresh in the story-line. On the other hand, there aren't too many scenes that make you grimace with embarrassment for the actors and there are actually a few nice little scenes with some genuine feeling to them.

Her main Irish love interest is unappealing at the beginning and doesn't completely improve by the end. Their early animosity quickly becomes tedious, then continues throughout too much of the movie.

In fact, all the Irish people in the movie get rather poor portrayals. The Irish people I've known were more friendly than those you see in this movie.

I found it rather incredulous that the Amy Adams character would fall for such a rude and unromantic guy.

He travels on business, while she travels for romance and rocky roads create romantic routes.  Declan, Matthew Goode, takes her across Ireland amdist the always beautiful and scraggy countryside.  Just like a good western, the scenery always part of any films' success, and this is no different.  One thing that sets this film apart is the love first, sex later mantra that is very welcome from Hollywood.

Having watched many romantic comedies over the last 20 years, I can truly say this film is one of the best I have seen.  Perhaps it's due to Amy Adams, or the good ensemble cast, or the fact that this is more than just another date film.

4091823,4,B0038N9X3Q,"LEAP YEAR will test your jaded cynicism, friend, yes, it will. In its sensibilities LEAP YEAR calls to mind the fancified, sentimental blarney of THE QUIET MAN more so than, say, the working class grit and realism of THE COMMITMENTS or ONCE. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure this bit of comedic romantic fluff was never intended as social commentary. This film is rife with tired cliches, redolent with contrived plot twists. The lead character, Anna Brady, loathes surprises. She would've loved this movie. And I know, I know, I'm bagging on this film, and I feel kind of mealy-mouthed. In the rankings of road romantic films, by no means is LEAP YEAR a classic like IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. I don't even think it's in the same class as THE SURE THING. But I like this movie.

It's an old recipe, right? Take an uptight character - Amy Adams plays uber-organized Bostonian, Anna Brady - and plonk her in an unfamiliar environment and see how she does. By trade Anna is an apartment stager, meaning she pretties up a joint that's been put up for sale, making it look more enticing that it may really be. Anna plans for everything, and her need for control even shades into her romantic relationship. She's been with the same guy for four years now, a cardiologist whose smarminess makes him easy to not root for. When he goes to Ireland on business, Anna does maybe the most impetuous thing she's ever done. She follows him to Ireland to propose. On the Emerald Isle, on February 29th, folklore custom suggests it's perfectly okay for the girl to ask the guy. How very forward thinking.

S#!+ happens, though. Foul weather diverts Anna's plane, and she ultimately ends up on the wrong side of Ireland, in this tiny town called Dingle, a word ideal for snickering. Looking for a ride to Dublin, she runs into Declan (Matthew Goode, quite good), this young, grouchy, scruffy innkeeper. She needs a ride. He needs to come up with some quick cash. Off they go. Even though they don't like each other. She's all snippy and brittle. He's brooding and, well, Irish. You can see it coming, right?

By the way, Declan frankly considers the Leap Year tradition of proposing to be the Lord of All Poo.

You see everything coming, you do. From the quirky Irish villagers and their whimsical superstitions to the obstacles which pop up to hinder Anna from reaching Dublin in timely fashion. Frankly, Anna's Louis Vuitton suitcase makes for a more interesting supporting character. But here's the thing: all the by-the-book narrative devices can be surmounted if only there's spark between the two romantic leads, and I think we have that here. Adams and Goode's charisma and chemistry push this boulder of a movie up that hill. They take an unoriginal screenplay and make their scenes seem effortless and just about organic. Or maybe I'm being tricked silly by Amy Adams, who I think is just flawless. But I see her impeccable comedic timing and her effervescence and that sense of vulnerability she projects and that red hair, and I'm sunk, bro. Amy Adams always gets to me, and the weak script can go hang.

The scenic Irish countryside ain't too shabby, either. If nothing else, LEAP YEAR works as a quaint and picturesque travelogue.",1273968000,,3224,4.729537366548043
4091824,1,B0038N9X3Q,"Yes, I know I put horrible twice. This was purposeful.

I went to see this movie with my sisters (neither of whom enjoyed it in the least)... and was thoroughly unimpressed. Not only was it a completely predictable story, the humor wasn't humorous, the attempts at romance weren't romantic, and the realism was non-existent. No, this is not because I'm pessimistic. This is because this story would LITERALLY never happen. Although, the girl sitting next to me was in tears by the end, so apparently it can touch the heart of those who are easily moved by cheesy, mass-produced Hollywood romance. All I can say is that if you've seen another romantic comedy made in Hollywood where the couple actually gets together at the end, you've seen a movie much better than this one.

Maybe it was stupid of me to expect a light-hearted, humorous romantic comedy from a film advertised as such, but literally, I have never been so underwhelmed by a chick flick. Maybe I'm an idiot to expect a slight amount of real human interaction on screen from such good actors. All that I do know is that this movie was a waste of money in the theaters, and it will be a waste of money to purchase. Unless you're buying it for the sappiest sap that has ever lived.

SUGGESTION:
If you would like to see an excellent movie set in Ireland with REAL feelings, REAL comedy, and REAL human interactions, rent or buy ""Once"".",1273881600,12,1397,4.602409638554217

4091826,2,B0038N9X3Q,"I have mixed feelings on this film.

Minus side:
o poorly written dialogue with thin, one-dimensional characters
o extremely predictable, simplistic story
o implausible plot holes throughout the film
o poorly (cheaply?) made visual effects
o forced chemistry between two lead characters

Plus side:
o Amy Adams is gorgeous
o Ireland looks beautiful (makes a great promotional film for the country!)
o I liked the ending

In short, all of the negative reviews are justified. This is a movie for (1) fans of Amy Adams or (2) fans of Ireland. If you are not interested in either, stay away from this movie!

Being an Adams fan myself, I forced my way through this overly-predictable film. As a romantic-comedy, it has its moments, but they are too far and few between.

Amy looks beautiful though. It is a shame that she couldn't focus her effort on better films as she is clearly in her prime.

After suffering through the film, the ending was a little different than what I had expected. I don't believe in posting spoilers, but I felt that the ending was somewhat better than the film itself, even though it was still a hokey ending, the cinematography was beautiful and it leaves you somewhat satisfied and gives you a little back after making you sit through the whole film.

I can only imagine that previous posters of such glowing reviews either (a) didn't see the film, or (b) are huge fans of Amy or Ireland.",1273708800,8,1414,4.700404858299595
4091827,5,B0038N9X3Q,"SHE flies to Ireland for a ""LEAPyear"" proposal & meets a pub owner. Yes, predictable, BUT. The journey is so beautiful. Gorgeous in a romantic way, and breathtaking in a scenic way. Add humor and you have a perfectly delightful movie for any age, the whole family, to enjoy.

Declan (Matthew Goode-'Brideshead Revisited') is the pub owner who also, to save the local pub, of course, is hired to drive Anna (Amy Adams-'JULIE & Julia') to Dublin. Anna missed her flight destination by a country (a forced Wales landing) due to storms. For some reason, the boat Anna found to take her from Wales to Cork in the storm bypassed that port and went on to Dingle Peninsula. The good news is, because of the needed cross-Ireland travel viewers get to see the old-world charm of Dingle and the beautiful countryside along the way, through Tipperary, and eastward to Dublin.

Declan's Irish accent will have all the lassies a hankerin' after him.
Country scenes are absolutely Irish heaven.
Some awesome Irish music, but never enough.
The Caragh's Bar looks as authentic as can be, 'cause it tis.
I've been to Ireland twice, & after seeing this movie, remember the cows on the roads, sudden rains, B&B's, and wish to return.
You can almost smell the peat fire mixed with the damp plaster smell in the movie's B&B.
Subtitles and deleted scenes for DVD extras.
It be grand, indeed.

The scenery almost upstages the story, but not quite. It is like the crust on the shepherd's pie. It holds together the romance and humor.

A movie for every romantic, especially Irish romantics. Worth repeated viewing.",1273363200,21,1589,4.788321167883212
4091828,5,B0038N9X3Q,"I gave this to my mom as a Mother's Day present, and she was very happy with it. This is a great film, with a great message. Amy Adams stars as a woman named Anna who has been in a relationship with Jeremy for 4 years, and is ready for him to pop the question. She soon travels to Dublin, Ireland to propose to him because according to Irish tradition, a woman can propose to a man on February 29th during a leap year. Because of a storm, Anna must land in Wales. She hires an innkeeper named Declan to drive her to Dublin. They don't get along too well, but they slowly begin to fall in love. If you love comedies and love stories, you'll love LEAP YEAR!!!",1273363200,2,657,4.10077519379845
4091829,4,B0038N9X3Q,"LEAP YEAR is a cute movie. I have to admit, though, that I'm prejudiced. I happen to be totally wrapped in an Amy Adams crush at the age of 50. I was so sad to hear about her pregnancy; not sad that she's pregnant, mind you. That's a blast. No, I'm sad that I never got a chance to be the Daddy of the expected bundle of joy.

Leaving my yen for the pale skinned, freckled, red haired Ms. Adams to one side, LEAP YEAR takes place in Ireland (she fits right in, obviously). Amy plays Anna, a career-driven young American girl who is living in love with Jeremy, her cardiologist boyfriend. She gets a bit of a shock when, after four years, he blows a perfect moment to ask her to marry him.

Following an old Irish tradition, she follows Jeremy to Ireland where he is presenting at a symposium, dedicated to asking him to marry her on Leap Day. Unfortunately, she is presented with a bit of an odyssey: Airports are closed due to a North Atlantic storm, her flight is diverted to Wales, the Fishguard Ferry is not running, and the boat she hires to cross the Irish Sea somehow ends up off the Dingle Peninsula. Given that Dingle is on the Atlantic coast, the opposite side of the country from Wales, I can only assume that this storm must have been related to Dorothy's famous cyclone.

But never mind. Stranded in Dingle, Anna hires Declan (Matthew Goode) to drive her to Dublin. James Joyce in ULYSSES never came up with a more convoluted tale of wanderings. Considering that the Dingle-to-Dublin drive should take five hours maximum, the fact that they spend three days crossing a country smaller than New York State is inexplicable. But again, never mind. Amy's so lovely I'd follow her anywhere.

Of course, love blossoms, even though Anna and Declan can't stand each other at first. He delivers her to Dublin, into the arms of Jeremy, who suddenly seems less  attractive to her than the rough-hewn Declan. Declan goes off, downcast. Anna and Jeremy get engaged in Dublin, and go home to Boston.

It isn't long before Anna realizes where her heart lies, and wouldn't ye know it, but sure, 'n' begorrah, she predictably ends up back in Ireland. Everybody lives happily ever after, including Jeremy, who is more romantically linked to his bluetooth than to Anna. What a jerk!

It's a chick flick par excellence, a date movie nonpareil, and if you're like me, you'll probably pay more attention to the girl on the screen than the girl sitting next to you. My advice is: Don't be a jerk. Kiss your date. Amy's taken.",1273363200,,2515,4.550884955752212
4091830,2,B0038N9X3Q,"From my wife Sarah: I love romantic comedies. I realize this story line has been done over and over in various movies, but I still enjoy this type of movie and was excited to see it. Overwhelmingly the on-line reviews ([...] and [...]) were very negative, but I'm a fan of Amy Adams, and I figured it would at least be pleasant and romantic. The commercials looked appealing after all.

Well it was really as bad as the reviews indicated. I don't get some of the good reviews here on Amazon and I have to wonder if they're from truly impartial people. They're so far from what the majority of reviews say on other sites.

At the core, the script was very poorly done. While Amy Adam's character was developed to some extent, Matthew's character was not. His character came off as shallow, non-communicative, rude, distant, and apart from his appearance, completely undesirable. There was nothing about this character that any woman would want. At no time was there even a moment of heat or chemistry between Matthew and Amy. Zip. Zero.

Other reviews on Amazon say this movie was filled with funny moments. If you've seen the previews, you've seen every comical moment. And taken in context, they were not really funny. Contrary to what the Amazon featured review is saying, the film was dull, slow and not romantic AT ALL.

Matthew Goode and Amy Adams did a great job with what they were given. The Ireland scenery was very beautiful and it makes you want to go there. Still I can't give it more than two stars, and I just can't recommend that anyone take the time to view this movie.",1273190400,5,1585,4.590106007067138
