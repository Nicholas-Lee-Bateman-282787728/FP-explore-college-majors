6452546,5,B00KWP6JOY,Looked for this movie for years. It did not disappoint me. It is old but a very moving cinema.,1440892800,2,94,4.0
6452547,2,B00KWP6JOY,"Since we have all the Greer Garson/Walter Pidgeon movies in which they star together, we thought this movie would not let us down.  Unfortunately, they did.  The movie was flat, and the sound that the goldfish supposedly made was ridiculous, especially in a movie with a serious theme.",1435708800,,285,4.916666666666667
6452548,4,B00KWP6JOY,"I enjoy anything with Greer Garson in it and this is a nice story about the conflict between
religions and how it is settled.  Nice enjoyable movie with no violence.",1429747200,4,165,4.5

6452552,4,B00KWP6JOY,"This is a dated, but unusual story.  There are sections where the brilliance of Norman Corwin's writing are apparent and that make the entire film definitely worth seeing.  The subject matter regarding bigotry and intolerance are timeless subjects.",1412812800,4,248,5.5
6452553,5,B00KWP6JOY,"SCANDAL AT SCOURIE  is an unfogettable film with a great cast, WALTER PIDGEON, GREER GARSON and the wonderful child actress DONNA CORCORAN. I had to wait a long time for the release of this little jewel dealing with the rivalry between Christian Catholics and Christian Protestants in Ontario, Canada. It is unfortunate that Donna Corcoran's films are so hard to get, I am still waiting for the release of Gypsy Colt (1949), a delightful horse story that you would certainly love if you are a fan of Lassie Come Home with the great Elizabeth Taylor; more of Donna's work should be released. Of course, I don't need to say anything about master actor Walter Pidgeon, truly one of a kind, absolutely natural in every role he played, and Greer Garson, another Hollywood legend. A truly enjoyable film. Recommended for all the family.",1411084800,6,830,4.845070422535211
6452554,5,B00KWP6JOY,"I have found this film delightful on so many levels. It is heartwarming and the cast is perfect. The child actress is adorable. The film is set in Canada where there was a conflict between Catholic and Protestant people over the adoption of an orphan. I saw part of this movie on TCM and was determined to have it. Fortunately, this site sold it. It has become one of my favorite films.",1407715200,11,386,4.375
6452555,5,B00KWP6JOY,"I haven't received this one yet but I know i'll love it.  The children are just gorgeous.  Greer is perfect as always and the clothes and colours she wears is so lovely.
I've seen it before and thoroughly enjoyed it, and cried even.  It's a really warm hearted story.
