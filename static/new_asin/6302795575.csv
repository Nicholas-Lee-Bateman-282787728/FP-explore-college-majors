511176,5,6302795575,"I enjoyed this film. It is heart-warming and really delightful. A young Native American of the Cheyenne tribe is able to win the woman he loves. The two have twins. In a raid by the Crow tribe, one of the twins  just a child - is kidnapped. He searches for the boy, sees him, but then loses him. His wife is killed and he is left with only one son. He is now old and dies. The crow who kidnapped his son tries to kill the other son and his family. He comes back to life to help his son that was left to him and the son's family.
The love shown in the old man's family is palpable.
I highly recommend the film.",1487808000,,609,3.911290322580645

511224,5,6302795575,"I saw this in a theatre during its initial run. It was beautiful then, and has improved in my estimation after earning a degree in anthropology. Two different native languages, along with Plains Sign Language are featured in this move, with English sub-titles. A story of two brothers, one kidnapped as a child and raised to be the enemy of his birth family and tribe. A lot of effort went into making this piece correct in clothing, languages, story, and action sequences. I don't want to give away plot points, but this movie shows just how sneaky the elderly and two or three kids can be in a crisis situation. If you like this movie, you might like ""Pathfinder"", which is a Finnish story set approximately a thousand years ago.",1483920000,,731,4.630769230769231

511296,1,6302795575,The casting was horrible. They couldn't find any Native Americans so they used just about every other ethnicity. It could have been a decent film but I couldn't get past the casting. The music was another miss since some scenes sounded like carnival music. I can't understand how anyone could have thought this was worthy of anything above one star and the only reason I gave that was for scenery.,1472860800,,397,4.685714285714286
511297,5,6302795575,"This was an excellent story and movie, characters well developed, scenery and action realistic. Viewers should realize all dialogue in this film was true Cheyenne with English subtitles similar to Dances with Wolves was done in Souix. As a Cheyenne, I recognized some words spoken when young. This shows the high level of reality filmmakers achieved.

511301,5,6302795575,"This movie was great! I was kept spellbound through out the entire show. This story is told by narration, the story of an elder Native American, and the ironic twists that happen at the end of his years with his family. It is really worth watching & I couldn't wait to recommend it to everyone I know. Each person I know who followed my advice, was so glad that they got to see this show! The actors did a wonderful job! This is one of those movies that you want to buy for your own personal collection and watch over and over. This is definitely a classic you'll be so glad you didn't miss!",1467072000,4,591,4.192982456140351

511388,5,6302795575,"I saw this movie as a little girl with my grandpa and have loved it since. It is visually breathtaking and the story telling is magnificent. Trevor Howard did the part with dignity.  He believable as a warrior and managed the Cheyenne dialect well. I have students who do not speak English and even they were in love with this film. I have one copy for school and one for home. Best Native American movie ever made, in my opinion.",1458950400,,430,4.375

Now that I have a 65"" 4K, I really really wish it  was available in 1080p widescreen HD on Blue Ray.  This movie has sparce dialog, which is ok because a lot of the story is simply told by the photography, which is great, in general.  The dialog adds punch, fills in gaps and adds some great humor to the situation.  I watch this over an over, just like I do ""Dave"" or ""The Princess Bride"" or ""A Knight's Tale"" or ""Ever After"" or ""Ground Hog Day"" or ""Sister Act"".",1451606400,,549,4.037037037037037

You can easily connect with the characters, even though it is closed captioned being translated from their native language.  Great movie - highly recommend it, especially if you have an interest in the lives of our indigenous population.",1441929600,,324,5.0754716981132075

511688,5,6302795575,I have remembered this movie for over thirty years when I saw it in the theater. It was the first time I had ever seen the audience stand up and clap when it was done. As an American of Mohegan background I appreciated the retelling of a small part of my culture. It doesn't matter that the main actor was not Native since the casting was just an echo of the times it was filmed. It was beautifully filmed and wonderfully told in Cheyenne and Crow (which made it so much more authentic) I have been looking for this movie for decades. It should not be missed by anyone.,1439164800,5,569,4.229357798165138

511691,4,6302795575,II liked this.  It is hard to believe a British actor played the major Indian part.  If you like movies that are historical you will like this one.,1436832000,,147,4.214285714285714
511692,5,6302795575,"The first movie I ever saw on the big screen, before the multiplexs'. Very authentic and well made portrayl of NativeAmerican life before the influx of ""White culture"" and the destruction of the plains horse societies of the 18 & 19 centuries. Not just because I'm an American Indian, but from a cinematic standpoint:one of the best films of the last 40 years! Even though the primary character (Trevor Howard) is caucasian. The rest of the cast is almost totally native. Including the recently passed- Nick Ramus.",1436572800,,514,4.919540229885057

511735,5,6302795575,"One of the best movies of all time. Made on my friend's families' land in Utah and they were their buffaloes. I can watch this movie over and over. We can see Paradise Lost before the Europeans came to the Eden the Original People lived in. Interesting to see how Paradise still faced the same human condition of war, jealousy, and on the other side the pure strength of the love of family; and the interaction between this world and the Spirit World. Unbelievable.. An amazing accomplishment. Breathtaking!",1434844800,2,507,4.7727272727272725

Our original copy on VHS, that we had purchased  back in the early 1980s, had deteriorated to the point it was no good to watch any more. Now that we have it on DVD, it should be good for decades. Something I will pass to one of the grandchildren.

I rate this movie 4 stars out of 5 stars. The portrayal of Cheyenne life back in the late 1700s is very authentic, the acting is very good, and the storyline keeps your attention.",1428278400,,522,4.107843137254902

511807,5,6302795575,Best Native American film ever,1420502400,,30,5.2
511808,5,6302795575,Any Native American movie buffs this is a movie you will like. Hard to find ones to watch. Hollywood isn't doing much on this genre.,1420329600,,132,4.32
511809,3,6302795575,"Released in late 1980, ""Windwalker"" is an unconventional Western in that there are no white people (cowboys, cavalry, etc.) and all the dialogue is spoken in Native languages with English subtitles; the story takes place in what later became Utah in 1797 with flashbacks to 50 years earlier. Trevor Howard plays an aged Cheyenne who's about to die and James Remar plays the younger version of the same man. The plot revolves around the Cheyenne's family and their skirmishes with a small band of Crow warriors. Nick Ramus, Serene Hedin and Dusty McCrea also have significant roles.

This is a beautiful and well-intentioned film, but it's not without some weaknesses. The Utah wilderness locations are picturesque and the score is pleasant, albeit dated; it sounds exactly like what it is: early 80s New Age music made for an historical fantasy film about Native Americans. And whereas the Cheyenne and Crow characters look generally authentic, they somehow appear too clean, like they put on their brand-new Native clothing a few hours before filming; in other words, it smacks of fantasy more than reality. The depiction of Natives in ""Jeremiah Johnson"" eight years earlier was noticeably superior. Another negative is the usage of white dudes in major Native roles and Asian boys as Indian children, but I guess they had to do what they had to do to get the film made. And, besides, Howard has Indian-looking facial features despite the color of his eyes and I wouldn't be surprised if Remar had Native blood in his veins. As far as the Asian boys goes, didn't Native Americans originate from Asia in the first place? In other words, they're acceptable substitutes to genuine Native Americans.

Despite the negatives, this is definitely a beautiful film; I just wish the story was more realistic and interesting, like the depiction of 17th century Natives in 1991's excellent ""Black Robe,"" one of my all-time favorite movies. Although a lot of the story in ""Windwalker"" is good, there are a lot of comic book elements and it's at times fantastical. Moreover, the story raises questions, like how does this elderly man, just risen from death or near death, kill and skin a bear? And how long does it take him to tan the hide? It looked like a day.

Still, the movie's worth seeking out if the positives trip your trigger. A lot of people love ""Windwalker.""

The film runs 108 minutes.

511892,5,6302795575,"Wonderful movie - beautiful choreography, great actors, and historical credibility. Only one negative aspect, in my opinion. The producers used Trevor Howard (a British Caucasian) for the lead role. But they used indigenous people of North America for every single other role in the movie. The movie was about Cheyennes and Crows only. There was no other ethnic group in the plot other than indigenous North Americans. The movie was released in 1981, probably cast and filmed during the preceding two or three years. I believe the choice to use a British Caucasian for the lead character (a Cheyenne) was intentional. Now to be fair, I have not yet read Blaine Yorgason's novel on which this movie was based. Perhaps he included Caucasians in his novel. If so, then I would be amenable to reducing the heat a little on my negative perspective about this movie.",1410048000,,860,4.897260273972603

There are no evil White Men, killing women and children, just ordinary Evil men, killing women and stealing children. Wholesome?.....Scary?......Yes, but very real and very important and strong, nonetheless. It is a story of redemption, and finding lost children. It is a story of a father who never gives up, and has an amazing relationship with God, (whom he calls Father) and says to at the end, ""What a funny Father you are, saving the best for last).

We love movies that show how Native Americans would have lived and problems they would have encountered in their daily lives. Whats great about this movie is that it draws you in to where you actually feel what the main character is feeling. This only gripe is that there are no extra features which is expected with an old movie. This can be an expensive movie to get a hold of. I bought one for my dad, used, but in very good condition. It was fairly priced but my dad is worth it.

512051,4,6302795575,"I'm a Northern Cheyenne Tribal member from Montana, and a direct blood descendant of Chief Dull Knife. I watched this movie when I was a kid growing up and thought it was pretty good. After watching it again last night with my fellow Northern Cheyenne wife and son, there were a few things that I had concerns about and realize that the movie is dated. First, obviously the lead actor was a white actor playing an old Cheyenne Warrior, but so was the ""young"" version of the main character, wearing a horrible wig with blue eyes. Second, the corny scenes of his deceased wife, Tashina were a bit much, one, maybe two would have been enough. Third, was his son banished, a deserter or just a loner from the rest of the tribe? Why didn't he, his wives and children live amongst the rest of them? Was he a medicine man?

Other than those ""minor"" issues, I still like a lot about the film; the actors spoke Cheyenne and Crow, which adds a bit of authenticity and timelessness to the film. Also, the setting in the mountains sure does look like the foothills and mountains where I grew up - on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.

I would like to see this film re-made with Native actors with a few updates, but it'll remain in my library to share with my native and non-native friends alike.",1374796800,3,1285,4.463829787234043

Trevor Howard was great in his lead role. The story line, I will not mention,it would ruin your puchase. But it is a very deep, almist religious in it's own way.

It's unfortunate that the film is seldom shown anymore (it's probably been 2 decades since I last saw it on cable)... It is a beautiful story of a man's love and devotion to his family, and his life-long determination to reunite with his child who has been stolen from him. It's rare to see a movie that depicts traditional American Indian life before the arrival of white men.

Once you get used to the flash back patterns, it settles into an intriguing story. It's very different and quite authentic, the scenery and the filmography are first class, I think for what must have been a low budget movie they did a really good job.

512276,4,6302795575,"Based on the novel by Blaine M. Yorgason, Windwalker is a story that holds its viewers captive until the very end. Set in the Midwest's striking Black Hills during the late 1700s, the story begins in the dead of winter with an old, dying Cheyenne man telling his two young grandsons the story of his life.

His story contains elements of hope, love, determination, disappointment, happiness, death, tragedy, and sorrow. Tears pool inside the man's eyes as he tells of one fateful day when his enemy, the opposing Crow tribe, stole what he had loved and cherished the most. Ever since that day, his life had been an endless journey as he searched for the son that had been snatched away from him--the son that he was never able to reclaim. With a weary, tearful smile, the old man murmurs that his journeys are now over and that, ""It is a good day to die."" His eyelids droop shut, and he breathes his last.

As the old man's journey comes to an apparent end, a new journey unfolds for the family he left behind. After conducting a proper funeral ceremony, the man's remaining son and his wives and children begin a travel of their own to escape the disease that is ravaging their people. Vulnerable and alone inside the wooded Black Hills, they become easy prey for their infamous Crow adversaries.

Windwalker is a story of hard work and survival with themes including a father's undying love, the strength of family ties, perseverance, and young boys becoming men. Though simple, the tale will tend to sweep you along and leave you laughing, crying, and gripping the edge of your seat.

Overall, the 1981 film is well-made. One of the things I appreciated most about it was the accurate portrayal of the native Indian people, who are often wrongly presented as wild, inhuman savages in other films. All dialogue is spoken in the native Crow and Cheyenne dialects, and footnotes are provided at the bottom of the screen. Very little dialogue is actually spoken, and the well-acted drama is used to carry the story along.

Windwalker does contain a few minor quirks, the biggest being its music, which, at times, could be better. A few of the measures tend to pull the audience away from the native atmosphere, such as the sudden burst of triangles every time the father's white horse appears. Another has to do with the Crow warriors' superstitious fascination, and even fear, with the white horse. This superstition is largely unexplained to the audience and can be somewhat confusing. A few sections of the film also tend to drag when action scenes are separated by clips of the surrounding scenery, sometimes lasting the better part of a minute.

Despite its few weak points, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good family film. Captivating and heart-touching, this classic should leave few people disappointed.",1328140800,2,2839,4.7955010224948875

It was a theatrical presentation and was presented in widescreen or letterbox so go figure. All I know is that I won't purchase this film until it gets the treatment it deserves and the distributors of the film stop treating the public as if they are idiots.

The Native American in this movie referred to this Great Spirit or ""Grandfather"" throughout his life and as many Christians await to meet their families and friends that had gone on, so does this Native American await for that marvious day to meet his bride in his youth again in their eternal home.

512351,5,6302795575,My father is Nick Ramus. The work he did for Windwalker was some of his most rewarding work. The honesty was what intrigued him the most about the script. We are Blackkfeet and many of the extras and small roles went to actual Crow tribal members. Blackfeet and Crow are historical enemies. During the shooting My father playing the part of the Cheyenne Brother had to use some pretty bad language about the Crow while being surrounded by real Crow braves. My father said it was one of the most erie things he ever had to do. Nick was concerned that the Crow would take offence. To his delight the Crow were thoroughly delighted in his performance and gave him a reverred Eagle fan. To this I want to add this speaks honestly to what the actors were feeling. As an aside James Remar does have Native American ancestry. Someone stated inacurately that he was white in their review.

This is a classic film that will be sitting on your shelf between Princess Bride and Dances with Wolves; it's not one of the movies you'll watch once and put away. Your kids will choose to see it again and again on family night. (and you'll be sitting right there just as enthralled each time as they are) Great movie for Native American history buffs as well as people who enjoy horses. An exciting story with a surprise ending. If you don't buy this movie for your family, someone needs to give you a very painful wedgie... I strongly suggest you buy TWO of these as you will love it so much you'll want to share it with someone else - and as we both know when you loan a movie you rarely get it back!

The Windwalker by Blaine M. Yorgason  (I was lucky enough to inherit a copy that's the 5th printing, 1980)

This was one of the first movies that stirred the echoes of my native ancestors in my soul.  Though it does not have native actors, it accurately portrays the Cheyenne and Crow and the beliefs.

If only they would have had consideration for native people of this country and used native actors for ALL parts....especially since there is not one single part of a caucasian character in this film....

If only the makers of this film had not been so typically Hollywood in their approach and casting....this could have been a truly great anthropological film.

As it stands this film is yet another sad and disappointing example of just how little respect the dominant society had (the film was made in 1981) for native americans.

The only good thing they did in this film is to have the actors speak in native Cheyenne / Crow language....although the actors are so horrible at speaking these languages that it almost sounds like a made up dialogue. Again....had the producers of this film used REAL Cheyenne and Crow Indians then this too would not have been an issue.

The musical score also is not at all in keeping with the plot and nature of the film....sounds like they took a soundtrack to some 70's nature documentary and threw it behind the scenes in the film.

Hollywood should re-make this film, with real native actors, speaking in their native language, with a score that truly reflects the drama and message of this story.",1160352000,11,1542,4.7565543071161045

While it would have been nice if there had been native American actors, this film broke the stereotype and was the first to present the Native Americans in an authentic way in spite of the christian influence of the ending.  My first reaction on seeing Trevor Howard in the lead when i saw this film in the theatres was one of disappointment. However, after seeing the picture and the way he portrayed the grandfather, I realized that the director knew what he was doing. The way of life, environment and regalia are 100% accurate, as is the Crow and Northern Cheyenne dialog. While some Native Americans dish the movie because of the lack of Native American actors, they miss the point. For the first time, our culture and lifestyle are accurately reported, in a respectful, dignified way.

Oh, and about those long looks into the camera, I do not know what they could have done about Trevor Howard's blue eyes, but could he not have taken off his contact lenses for that really tight close up?",1149206400,,539,4.203883495145631

""Windwalker"" never loses impact, however, on account of the details of costuming, indian language, lore and on-site location shooting. The romance of James Fenimore Cooper soars again in this wonderful yarn. Magnificent. Both protagonist and antagonist are fully-realized, proud, noble and human.",1141344000,5,751,5.372881355932203

This is one of the most realistic portrayals of Native American Indian life, ever made. Trevor Howard, although mis-cast, does a very convincing job of potraying 'Windwalker', the aged, 18th century, Cheyenne warrior about to die. Actually, he's left on his grave, and thought dead already, by his family...who leave camp to head south for winter. But is he really dead? He still has one thing left to do...find his long lost son, who was captured by the Crow, as a young boy. He arises to rejoin his family, and tells his life's story to his two grandsons and daughter-in-law. But a Crow raiding party is on their trail. Then things really get interesting!

 Not for the little ones, as it does contain some violence and even an attempted rape scene. But overall it's well worth letting older children watch and learn from. Lots of good lessons on life here! Trevor Howard is amazing. You will completely forget he's a white Englishman! I have always loved this rare gem of a film.

As a family film for children over 12, this one can't be beat.  This must be considered a first movie, in a time when using native actors and following closer to true clothing and cultures were just coming into being.

There are other things that Windwalker should be pissed off about, such as the death of his wife or the bear attacking his infant son. These however, take a back seat to finding his son.  When the movie first starts, Windwalker is a senior citizen.  Having unfulfilled his quest(s), he has given up hope and dies peacefully.  However, the spirit world gives him a new lease on life, although still in senior citizen mode, to battle all of the aforementioned injustices.  While Windwalker is being revived, the same people (the Crow Indians) who kidnapped his son and murdered his wife, and the bear who took a slash at his infant son, are lurking nearby.  With a little help, Windwalker is able to right all of the wrongs.

The best part of the movie is when Windwalker single-handedly kills the bear, with nothing more than a flimsy spear.  Next thing you know, Windwalker is strutting through the forest with full bear attire draped over his shoulder, complete with head and paws.  Furthermore, he `finds' a white stallion for transportation. Windwalker looks like a pimp.

Anyways, this movie is recommended for all.  The story is heartwarming and the scenery is amazing.  I saw this movie when I was ~8, so I didn't remember much.

512447,3,6302795575,"This is a noble exercise in telling a story exclusively set in the Cheyenne lands before Europeans had come on the scene. Is the story any good? Eh...it's okay...a little cheesy. The way the story is handled is also a mixed bag...uneven production quality, uneven acting and casting, terrible music, sometimes good - sometimes wretched cinematography (hello gauzy flashback), editing that is alternatively decent and lacking, a few plot holes here and there. You'll note that legendary actor and drunken fool, Trevor Howard, carries top billing despite being terminially caucasian. The old man does okay, but the film doesn't really focus on him as much as you expect. Creepy Billy Drago is also oddly present -most people remember him from The Untouchables as the creepy  Frank Nitti. Then there's James Remar, playing the young Trevor Howard, who's career hasn't done so much after the promising debut (?) in Walter Hill's The Warriors. Remar does decently and at least looks Native American. Ish.

On the plus side, some of the stunts were faily impressive, the landscape nice enough, the kids are cute and courageous and it's authentic as a motion picture has come to portraying how the Native Americans lived amongst themselves.

The terrible wigs were a distraction.

Also, I note that this movie was released as a ""PG"", even though there are multiple killings (slightly graphic) and two attempted rapes....parents with the small kids looking for some wholesome entertainment are forwarned.

The DVD quality is decent, though that still doesn't change the terrible score.

Rent before you buy, unless you're a freak for either Native American Anthropology or Trevor Howard wearing a big ol' bearskin.

Final note: One of the most irritating things about Amazon reviews is the way people give movies they ""like"" 5 stars and movies they don't one star. Then some people try to tip the scales back to something reasonable by giving it a one star. Oy. This is a three star movie through and though. It is by no means a masterpiece, nor is it a total waste. It's worth your time, but it is no Seven Samaurai. I noticed a number of reviewers here listing it as their favorite movie...ever (!).

Based on the jacket, Pacific International Enterprises, Inc., and Sterling Entertainment are involved in the production of the absurdly substandard VHS tape I received.  Indeed, as pointed out below, the 'thickness' of the totally rewound tape as one looked at the reel was about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick...I was thinking ""that's odd..maybe this is a new technology"";  as soon as I attempted to play the movie I found out why...the sound was distorted greatly and the picture blurry like I was looking thru the end of a coke bottle as a lense.  TOTALLY SUBSTANDARD for Amazon.com, and most surprised they would carry such BELOW STANDARD merchandise.

I think if you examine my purchase records you will conclude you do not want to lose me as an Amazon.com customer.
  YOU WILL (regretfully) however unless you immediately tend my concerns in reference to the above order number.
  Specifically, the WINDWALKER VHS tape is a JOKE !!!!

A profound disappointment as I attempted to watch a favorite old movie with anticipation and found that this far substandard trash of a VHS tape was so poor in  quality I could not watch it.
  Recently you will see I purchased not only numerous books, etc., but also a DSC-P93 Sony camera, accessories, etc....I buy a lot from Amazon.
  I WILL BUY NOTHING MORE UNTIL YOU MAKE THIS RIGHT.  FURTHER, NEVER send me such poor quality merchandise again if you want my business.
  ADVISE ME with specific instructions.  I also should NOT have to pay the postage returning this joke of a VHS tape to you.

Unique. Beautiful. Moving. Best natural motion picture ever made.",985478400,50,726,4.534351145038168
512482,5,6302795575,"what can i say about this movie to do it justice... i was 10 yrs. old when this came out and was able to see this at the theater. it's a wonderful movie, w/ excellent cinematography, and a well written story. the scenery is spectacular too. fans of the recent ""crouching tyger..."" may like this one as well... not for the story, but due to the fact that this filmed entirely in native american languages. the story itself has no similarity w/ ""crouching tyger..."" other than that it is brillianly filmed, written and acted. if you want to have an experience, rather than just watching something, buy ""the windwalker""... you won't be disappointed... trust me! watching this brings back the memories of a 10 year old movie fan. my one hope is to some day see the release of this on dvd. cheers all!",980208000,17,796,4.534722222222222

Like everyone else who has reviewed it, it is among a very small number of  moving, inspiring, and haunting movies. It traverses that narrow ledge  between maudlin and mawkish, yet never falls over. I never cry watching  movies. I cried.",969148800,5,312,4.618181818181818
512484,5,6302795575,"This movie has been watched by me almost as many times as I have watched Star Wars.  It is one of the most beautiful visually stimulating movies I have seen as well as being a fantastic story.  It is the first story of  Native Americans to treat them with dignity, majesty and respect that I  know of.  I was surprised that Trevor Howard (a wonderful English actor)  was chosen to portray the old Windwalker.  However, he spoke the native  dialect (I believe Cheyenne)with great dignity and reverence.  The story is  wonderful!  The scenery is not to be beaten.  The Native American actors  were fantastic and you cannot find a better way to spend your time than  sharing this with your whole family.",961632000,117,700,4.631147540983607

512506,5,6302795575,"If there was ever a movie that displayed man's spiritual relationship with God, this is the movie. Chief Windwalker's daily walk with the ""Great One"", and the beauty of nature that surrounds him only emphasizes what  God has always intended to provide to His creature. Who would ever have  thought that a movie about the life of a Native American would stress the  deep relationship that God has always intended for us. Additionally, to  surround His image with the beauty that He has bestowed upon us only  completes God's plan. Windwalker displays his braveness and courage as a  great warrior, his love and tenderness as a husband and father, and at the  same time, his dependence on the Great One for all His wisdom.",950745600,4,720,4.758064516129032

Even though the film is not new, it views like one.  I watch it over an over again. It ranks in my opinion as one of the top 10  movies of all time.

It has just taken me the longest time to find it and actually get my hands on a copy but thanks to this site I now own it.  Many movies may come and go with  their wild special effects but this movie is a classic native tale.  I wish  people would make more movies about Native american culture (everyone of  them seemed to be a hit).  Movies like this are good for the soul.  If only  we wouldn't just forget about the culture we destroyed with our westward  push, we might all be able to learn something from these fine people.",936835200,7,589,4.178571428571429

It is a great movie, very authentic, eye for detail. The movie is spoken in Cheyenne and Crow.
The only thing I did not understand is why if the old man dreams he dreams in  English? I saw this when I was a child and it is still hold the magic.  Thanks Amazon.com for selling this again!

7831158,5,6302795575,"I love this movie in spite of the fact that as some negative reviewers reported, it is white people playing native Americans.  I checked and actually Nick Ramos is from the Blackfoot tribe and other folks in the movie look Native American too but it is difficult to find information on them.  Others complained about Hispanics playing Native Americans in the movie but if you know history, Hispanics have lots of Native American genes since most Hispanics are over 80% Native American with the rest usually being Spanish genetics. Their tribes were from Mexico and Central and South America, of course, and not from North America... Most North American tribes aren't pure either having lots of other genes in the mix.  I suppose some zealots and puritans will demand exactness but this movie with the dialogues in the Native American languages of Crow and Cheyenne, well, it is awesome and yes, the actors aren't fluent in those languages but then most Native Americans aren't either since they were cruelly forced by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to give those languages up.  This movie did a nice job of resurrecting them.",1519862400,,1123,4.894736842105263
