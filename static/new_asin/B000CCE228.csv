2457319,4,B000CCE228,"All of these are hilarious. The part I did not get which friends from the UK say is a big one is the exact mastery of the movies that these are based on. Basically if you grew up  in UK watching these at age 8-10, there is a deep sense of longing of innocence these bring up.

As a yank all I can think of would be a satire of the cartoon ""I am just a bill""( waiting here on capital hill)  from ""How a Bill becomes a law"".

The episode on ""Ghosts"" stood out for me. A must see for comedy.

It won the EDINBURGH  comedy competition.",1391472000,,531,3.8703703703703702
2457320,5,B000CCE228,"Look around you season 2 is a rare television gem. Once you see it, it'll be etched into your mind never to be forgotten much like how people can remember where they were when president Kennedy was stabbed. Thanks amazon, thamazon.",1379808000,,231,4.658536585365853
2457321,3,B000CCE228,"I just thought I'd offer a different opinion than most of the other glowing reviews left on this product. I really loved the first series of Look Around You and I found the follow-up looser and less focused. The sly humor was not entirely replaced in series 2 but it now comes accompanied with cheap nail-on-the-head jokes that are often silly or violent and they just make everything feel less clever by juxtaposition.

I think a lot of what's wrong here besides there just being too much time for the writers to fill, (30 minutes per episode as opposed to 10,) is that the first one created this bizarre world in which things just basically physically worked differently than they do in this world. We only caught glimpses of that world and we didn't have much time to consider the ramifications. In a longer series, the really glib explorations of a world where world speed records are broken on TV shows and horses can invent computers seem tragically shallow. The suspension of disbelief breaks more frequently and it all seems a little dumber.

That's not to say it's crap. There's a lot of stuff that's still funny here. It's just that it's an exhausting death march of occasionally great jokes with a bunch of crap to step in along the way.",1376352000,5,1248,4.642533936651584
2457322,5,B000CCE228,"Excellent show full of puns and nerd humor, just for me! Season one was also great, but I think season 2 is more funny.",1369094400,,119,4.0

2457324,5,B000CCE228,"Please please please buy this.  It will make you smile inside, giggle in bed as you drift off to sleep for months afterwards and you'll be pleased you listened to me.  Matt Groening (creator of The Simpsons) has called it ""One of the funniest TV shows I've ever seen.""

It's a wonderfully accurate spoof of a 'Tomorrow's World' type show circa 1981.  The set is all browns and beiges and each week the future of science and technology is considered as the presenters speculate just what life might be like in the year 2000.

Whether it's predicting music styles of the turn of the millenium (search Youtube for 'Machadaynu' for my personal highlight), reviewing a downright absurd weight-loss product or discussing the merits of spray-on skin to plug your ear holes (called what else but ""Psilence"") with its inventor Leonard Hatred - exquisitely played by Mark Heap - the show is full of clever touches, wonderfully dreamed-up comic devices (ever heard the first verse to 'Happy Birthday To You'?) and attention to detail that tips its hat to the show's obviously high production values all the way through.

It was good enough for David Mitchell, Matt Lucas, Simon Pegg, Harry Enfield, Sarah Alexander, Peter Baynham(!), Olivia Colman, David Walliams ('the voice of Bournemouth') Kevin Eldon and, of course, the show's creators Peter Serafinowicz (voice of both Star Wars's Darth Maul and CeeBeebies's 'Driver Dan', by the way!) and Robert Popper (who wrote the eye-wateringly funny 'The Timewaster Letters' (buy that as well while you're here), commissioned Peep Show, and was the first ever contributor on Charlie Brooker's arrestingly brilliant 'Screenwipe') to all put in an appearance.  Even HRH Sir Prince Charles has a sizeable speaking part.

If you've read this far, you should by this DVD.  Honestly.  Even the extras are a cut above most of the other comedy out there.

I secretly envy that you still have to discover this wonderful piece of comedy.  Enjoy.",1279584000,5,1970,5.00920245398773
