8628049,2,B00GWUU6MY,"Farrah (Nicola Fiore) is a mentally ill former beauty queen who develops an unhealthy passion for convicted serial killer Jackson Miles (Tim Dax). She meets with Miles to get instructions on the best way to kill her family. Mom (Leesa Rowland) is getting remarried and has a relationship with her other daughter (Deborah Das).

The film needed better dialogue. Christine Hoberg did a great job as the wedding singer, but the rest of the soundtrack was hit and miss. Lloyd Kaufman managed a cameo as the minister, which always changes the mood whenever he is in the film, serious role or not. The cast was mostly from his former films. The ending, which you expected, took too long to arrive.

8628051,2,B00GWUU6MY,"While the premise was good, the acting was not. Also, video tape just looks plain awful!! Couldn't they have used film, which would have given  this movie a far superior look and richness. The video tape just looks ""flat"".
My recommendation sadly, is, ""Don't bother.""
If you want to see a good ""Slaughter"" movie, you'll have to review old ones from times past....",1394236800,6,363,4.761904761904762
8628052,5,B00GWUU6MY,Finally a female driven horror! The supporting characters are fun and the kills are especially enjoyable. But the best gore is when Farrah sends her finger to serial killer Jackson Miles (an awesome Tim Dax). Phyllis's dialogue is a hoot (a fantastic Leesa Rowland) & I love the soap opera type tone throughout the story. Nicola Fiore is a great leading lady and plays the title character very well. Also a great score by Travis Campbell. The special features include webisodes that show Farrah being developed as a character. The story centers around a girl that was pushed to the limit by her family & that is something we all can relate to!,1391644800,2,643,4.699115044247788
