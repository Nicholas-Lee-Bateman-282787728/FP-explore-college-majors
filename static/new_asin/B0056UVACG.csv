4592794,5,B0056UVACG,"For me this is the best Taiwanese drama that I have watched and I am really glad I decided to take a look at it. Xiao Xiao Bin is the best little kid actor out there and Vanness Wu and Ady An have the most fantastic chemistry. Oh man! Watched it before, about to watch it again probably again after that. This is a Need to WATCH and a Need to OWN.",1382918400,3,347,3.8333333333333335
4592795,5,B0056UVACG,"Oh My God!!!I cannot say enough about the Taiwanese Drama ""Autumn Concerto""....it is soooooo good. It's a drama that can't be touch and comes along once in a lifetime, and I can't say enough about the handsome lead actor Vanness Wu and the beautiful Ady An. Their son Xiaole was just so cute. The writing was tight and the drama flowed very well from the beginning to the end. This is a drama that makes you laugh and makes you cry, so be sure to have a box of tissue handy. I highly, highly recommend this one. You will not be disappointed.",1342915200,6,541,4.313725490196078
4592796,5,B0056UVACG,"My sister finally got me to watch this drama. I don't like foreign dramas because they are too silly for my taste. And degrading to women. But I'm happy to say this isn't the case with Autumn's Concerto. This is a masterpiece! It takes you through the emotions of being happy, sad, crying, joy, mad and finally back to romantic bliss. I highly recommend this drama. A true masterpiece.",1427241600,,385,4.594202898550725
4592797,5,B0056UVACG,"Ren Guang Xi, a cocky law student, seems to lead the perfect life. He's the sole successor to a huge and famous business and a talented ice hockey player. But in reality, his lonely life lacks joy, laughter and motivation. That is until he meets Liang Mu Cheng, the new bento seller at his school canteen. Although orphaned at a young age, Mu Cheng does not let her past affect her and lives life with great passion and determination. A harmless bet brings the two together and Guang Xi slowly changes as Mu Cheng teaches him how to give and love.

Mu Cheng lives a quiet life with her young son in the countryside while Guang Xi is now a successful lawyer and is engaged to He Yi Qian, the kind and beautiful doctor who took care of him after his surgery.

4592799,5,B0056UVACG,"I cannot say anything but good things about Autumn's Concerto and the actual dvd set itself. Let me start off by saying this is the first Taiwanese drama I watched when it first came out and I was definitely hooked by the first episode. It truly is one of the best love dramas I've watched combining Korean, Japanese, Taiwanese and whatever types of dramas are out there. The main cast was outstanding, especially the little child Xiao Xiao Bin who plays Liang Xiao Le. It might just be me, but some scenes got either a little corny or the acting was kind of funny with some of the side characters, but it didn't deter me from this awesome story. This will always be one of my favorites.

Liang Mu Cheng and Ren Guang Xi both come from really tough childhoods and cross paths when Mu Cheng, the ""bento girl"" who lives with her aunt and her husband that tries to spy on her and sexually tries to abuse her confronts Guang Xi, a man troubled with his past and PTSD after he blocks her bus with his car. The relationship starts off rocky as he thinks nothing of Mu Cheng because he believes that all women aren't sincere until he finally realizes her true loving and caring nature. Just when Guang Xi and Mu Cheng develop feelings for each other, Guang Xi learns that he has a brain tumor which is threatening his life and is the reason for his severe headaches and blackouts that occur throughout the story. More problems arise when his mother doesn't approve of the relationship between him and Mu Cheng and wants her son to marry Yi Qian, a kind girl aspiring to become a doctor. He goes through treatments with Mu Cheng by his side and agrees to go through operation so long as she will be there waiting for him after, but Mu Cheng is later told to leave by his mother since she only used Mu Cheng to make her son go through surgery. Years later, Mu Cheng is raising her and Guang Xi's child and Guang Xi has no idea about his past before his operation and is set to marry Yi Qian until their paths cross again where the story really takes off.

I highly recommend getting this DVD set. The cover is really beautiful along with the back cover and the inside which two sides unfold to reveal all the discs with different pictures of the beautiful family. There are even pictures in the back of the disc and makes the set look so much nicer. I was also afraid that the subtitles weren't going to be of good quality, but they are actually pretty decent. There are some grammatical and spelling errors here and there, but it isn't a throbbing constant and they're perfectly sync with no lag. If there was one thing to nit-pick on, it would probably be the previews at the beginning of each DVD. The DVD starts off with Warnings about copyright and piracy and then some previews on other Taiwanese dramas. The problem is that you can't skip the previews on your DVD player and I couldn't skip it on my Macbook as well, so you have to sit through it and that can be hard since it's such a good drama and you just want to watch the next episode. Other than that, I certainly would recommend this DVD set; you certainly won't be disappointed!",1422316800,,3135,4.375643224699829

4592803,5,B0056UVACG,"I actually caught all episodes on Netflix and I must say, I absolutely love it.  I love Asian film but this was the first soap opera that I have ever watching and it was sooo good.  From the beginning to the end you actually cared about the characters.  When they laughed, you laugh and when they cry, you cry.  I shed so many tears but it was so worth it.  Every episode was deliciously good and I just want to watch it again and again.  I will be adding this to my collection.  The romance between Mu Cheng and Ren...wow.  Just seeing them together made my heart melt.  I don't do spoilers but I will promise you that this is definitely worth watching!",1402617600,,654,4.252032520325203
4592804,5,B0056UVACG,"It is impossible to adequately praise AUTUMN'S CONCERTO. For its full run of thirty-four episodes, one is tempted to engage in binge-watching. At its base it is a love story that begins with the leads Ren Guang Xi (Vanness Wu) and Mu Cheng (Ady An) meeting with a strong dislike that gradually shifts into love. He is rich and arrogant; she is poor, lovely, and sweet. His family insists that he break up with her. The story line of love versus family status runs conventionally enough until Guang Xi develops a brain tumor and at this point it moves from drama to melodrama but by then the viewer is so involved that he scarcely notices. He survives the delicate operation only to suffer from amnesia. His brain is a blank. He finds a new love Emily (Tiffany Tsu) who teaches him how to be human again. Six years pass before he meets Mu Cheng. He bonds with her son, not realizing that he is the father. The boy acts as a love magnet. He is so appealing that all near him are drawn into his orb. He speaks more like a sage than a child but this is part of his appeal. The final dozen episodes dance around the painful question of how may trust be regained after each side has hurt the other. The answer of course comes from the boy who tells them that love is better than hate and honesty is better than lies. The enormous appeal of AUTUMN'S CONCERTO is based on the complexity of issues that arise when doubting couples ignore such advice. This series is full of single stand alone vignettes that resound with emotional power. In one of them Guang Xi has not yet declared his love for Mu Cheng and when she is kidnapped by a rival and placed in a goal mouth of an ice hockey ring, Guang Xi throws himself in front of her taking the pummeling that would have been hers. It is this mixing of the small scene with the ongoing power of major scenes that invests AUTUMN'S CONCERTO with the resonance that makes one wish it was longer than it was.",1401408000,2,1943,4.34065934065934
4592805,5,B0056UVACG,"This drama is one of the best  I have seen in a very long time, and the  first time I have actually sat through twenty-one (21) episodes non-stop finishing all within 24 hours. I think the child actor was excellent not that the other actors weren't  fantastic to say the least,  but to have a child  perform as he did was phenomenal.  As I stated in my earlier comments to vol 1 this drama will have a lasting effect on me.  I will share this DVD with my friends only after they sign a promissory note to return my copy and purchase  their own.  My feelings are  after they have  watch this drama  they probably will want to watch it several times as I have done,  then pretend to miss-place my copy and of course I will have to take them court  for it's return... seriously,  Again, Great Job  to all, Actors, Directors etc.... the sound tract was very good.  I'd hoped the last episode would have been a little more extensive and not end so abruptly, to show some of what was previewed, but I loved and enjoyed every minute watching it.",1400371200,3,1038,4.295336787564767

8459891,5,B0056UVACG,"This is one of the most beloved Taiwanese dramas ever.  And talk about drama!--there is sexual molestation, attempted rape, courtroom drama, brain tumors, amnesia, evil mothers, overlapping love triangles, villainous gangsters, adorable children, spoiled rich guy vs nice poor guy, self-effacing poor woman vs very nice female MD who made one fatal error in her love life.  Did I mention that Vanness Wu takes his shirt off twice during this series???",1503619200,,451,5.338028169014085

8459894,5,B0056UVACG,"I love this drama!! I watched it on Netflix, originally, then it was removed. I was so happy to find that it was available on DVDs. The only downside is that each disc (there are 7, three episodes per) are programmed to include trailers of other dramas and you are not able to skip the 7 minutes or so, you just have to let it run until it gets to the disc menu--no fast forward, no skipping .",1465344000,,393,4.051282051282051
