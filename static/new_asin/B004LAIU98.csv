4400978,5,B004LAIU98,These are anti-weed propaganda at its best (worst?)!!,1412899200,,53,5.75
4400979,5,B004LAIU98,"As a college professor, I witness hundreds of normal, promising young lives, educations, families, futures and careers destroyed by the Drug War and the lies about ""The Boogie Drugs!"". These kids are fed into the meat grinder of the Criminal Justice System by mindless, macho Drug Warriors (hopped up on steroids) with the very same self-righteous, pious, misguided attitudes expressed in this propaganda film. This racist, rabid holocaust has continued unabated for over forty years and cost over a trillion dollars, with no positive results. The only people profiting are the Draconian and Orwellian DEA and their business partners in crime: the Drug Cartels, the attorneys, the bail bondsmen, the prison industrial complex and the courts (and that is just the money on top of the table!).  Meanwhile Big Pharma and the medical machine rake in trillions pushing dangerous and extremely addictive ""prescription"" drugs and the legal and dangerous drugs, alcohol and nicotine, continue killing and destroying by the minute. All brought to you by The Big Brothel in Washington which makes a mockery of the U.S. Constitution and dishonors everybody who has sacrificed or died to defend it! Welcome to Amerika (where the white man still speaks with forked tongue)!",1401235200,11,1260,5.268656716417911
4400980,4,B004LAIU98,"This is pretty good entertainment for me: The familiar ""Reefer Madness"" (Which I was replacing from my out of commission old VHS tape of it), and the other ALL UNFAMILIAR TO ME other movies here.....Quite a slew of them. There must have been a lot of unfortunate hysteria about marijuana back in those times. It also unfortunately caused a lot of wrong information about the drug to set into the consciousness of people for years! We must rescind all ignorance!",1399420800,6,461,4.775
8434003,5,B004LAIU98,"Reefer Madness was the only film in the collection that I had seen, and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it again.  While many of the other films seem quite campy today, I can easily imagine how they were developed in a serious effort many decades ago to warn the youth of the time of the evils that were waiting to befall them.  My how the world's changed.",1473724800,,352,4.318181818181818
8434004,5,B004LAIU98,"God what people believe when it's fed to them from the Government.  It's hard to believe ""Reefer Madness"" is not a comedy when watched these days. Total lies! The way ""pot heads"" act in this film is crazy.  Way over the edge.  I don't think any one would believe that propaganda now.  The other films are icing on the cake, It sure shows how people can believe anything, different morals of the time and just plain out lies. Our parents grew up with that crap (as did I) I believe that is why so many folks still believe it.

I think no one caught the irony of the government having to make another film just a few years later it's called ""Hemp for Victory"". They needed hemp for the war effort, lots of it. So a few states were allowed to grow.  You can still find it growing here in MO.  Although I can't believe any one wants it (except The Drug Task Force, Local Sheriffs, etc, etc.) It won't give you any euphoria but it's good for a headache. When taken a a comedy these films are great to watch. The Government was trying to control our mores.  It didn't work! I'd reccomend this DVD for people who still believe Cannabis is the Devil's Drug. For folks who imbibe, get back and be prepared for the BS.  All these films give a good picture of how they tried to control us back then. Aren't you glad they would never lie the American people now? Watch, laugh (or cry) and try to understand how people got their information. Buy up some munchies and have a good time.",1468800000,2,1471,4.281588447653429

8434006,5,B004LAIU98,terrible movies for a great price. i bought this for my mom for her birthday. we love terrible B movies.,1455408000,,104,4.25
8434007,5,B004LAIU98,Can't beat these for old 50's propaganda... you'll die laughing. Great for background showing during a themed party or game night. We loved these!,1441411200,,146,5.125
8434008,5,B004LAIU98,"I purchased this DVD collection with another collection entitled ""The Devil's Harvest."" Both sets were a scream (very funny). The thing is, that these movies were to be taken serious in their day. After watching Reefer Madness a DVD I'd bought as a stand alone I wanted to see more of this propaganda type anti-drug movie. So I bought this set.

The storyline of most of these movies is simple; a teenager gets mixed up with a crowd where he or she takes their first toke on a joint and in just two weeks, they are mainlining heroin. Or you are shown that smoking pot causes you to be mentally insane or jump out a window to your death or drive recklessly through the city running down pedestrians. No wonder so many kids in the 60s and 70s didn't believe these films when they didn't see those things happen to their pot-smoking friends.

The entertainment from these movies isn't the message or the campy predictable story, but in the nostalgia. They're a glimpse in how teenagers enjoyed themselves in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. It's about the clothes, the cars and the dance places that makes these films interesting. I'd highly recommend this collection of videos. They won't stop anyone from smoking pot, but they will tickle your funny-bone.",1434931200,4,1249,4.698630136986301

8434011,5,B004LAIU98,I loved reefer madness and some of the films. Still haven't finished watching the set.,1420329600,,86,4.8
