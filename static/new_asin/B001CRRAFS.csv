8289040,5,B001CRRAFS,the scenery was gorgeous . I wish we could have seen a quick view of a map showing where they were filming but that is my only complaint .,1358553600,,138,3.793103448275862
8289041,3,B001CRRAFS,"Compared to Visions of England, Ireland and Scotland, I was a bit disappointed.  Visions of Wales was too short, had no Bonus Footage and no captions underneath what was being shown and talked about.  Sometimes the music was louder than the description of the location shown!  Of course, I realise it was not made by the same film company, which could account for the differences.",1339459200,,380,4.815384615384615
8289042,5,B001CRRAFS,"Beautifully filmed and happens to be narrated by my favorite actor (Geraint Wyn Davies)!  If you're planning to visit the British Isles, this is a must - see!",1301011200,4,158,4.642857142857143
8289043,5,B001CRRAFS,"This is by far the best of this series of Visions of, which includes England, Ireland and Scotland. The scenery, music and documentary are excellent. I bought this to show foreign students a glimpse of Wales and I'm sure that they will learn alot from it. I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the landscape and history of Wales as part of the British Isles.",1278460800,4,376,4.463768115942029
8289044,5,B001CRRAFS,All the Visions DVD's are awesome. Even if you've been all over Europe you'll see parts of countries that you'll never see or experience.,1248998400,2,137,4.75
8289045,5,B001CRRAFS,"I was flipping channels and stumbled across a dubbed version of this show on the VME spanish channel. I don't speak spanish, but spent the entire show mesmerized by the aerial eye-candy of this beautiful DVD. My wife sat down and fell into the same trance. Not a simple travelogue...they pan in detailed slow motion over intriguing Welsh castles, farms, coastlines...with light celtic music and occasional narration in the background. Very zen and IMAX-like.

So I immediately bought the english version here...too bad it's out of print and nearly gone. Hate to automatically give it 5 stars like everyone else does on Amazon, but this one deserves it.

NOTE: There are Visions of Scotland, England, Ireland DVDS too. I just bought them sight unseen.",1248393600,8,750,5.040322580645161
