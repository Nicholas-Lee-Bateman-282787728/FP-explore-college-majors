8266759,5,B0017OS1ZE,Loved everything about this movie. Mr Karamelli really steals the show.,1519862400,,71,5.545454545454546
8266760,1,B0017OS1ZE,"I thought the film was great up until part way through, when they bought out this greasy Italian dude, the actor playing him was really unprofessional and frankly ruin the whole film for me. I hope for the film industries sake that dude has been put into the system.",1386633600,14,266,4.448979591836735
8266761,5,B0017OS1ZE,"And when you do rent this movie, let me know what you think as I was in this movie which makes it that much more important that you see it.",1376956800,,139,3.6666666666666665
8266762,1,B0017OS1ZE,"This movie was truly aweful. The acting is aweful, the cinematography is aweful and the language is aweful. It watches like a reject from an indy film festival. I must have been thinking of the Jason Stathum film by the same name when I bought it, but this definitely isn't that. If anyone wants my copy (only viewed 1/2 of a time), it's yours for the cost of postage.",1228262400,,368,4.3478260869565215
8266763,1,B0017OS1ZE,Don't confuse this movie with one of the same name starring Jason Statham.  This one is amateur's night and not worth the time to watch.,1214784000,,136,4.44
8266764,5,B0017OS1ZE,"...was an excellent indie flick. I'm a sucker for small b-movies, and this one was definitely one of the best action ones I've seen. The car chases were amazing, reminded me of 70-s McQueen films, and although the acting and special effects weren't as good as you'd expect from a bigger studio release, I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in low budget independent movies. Two thumbs up!",1174953600,4,401,4.826086956521739
