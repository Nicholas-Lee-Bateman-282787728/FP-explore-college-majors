7867219,5,6304278853,This is the best ab exercise you will ever do.  I don't like to exercise and this method or technique works fast!,1399593600,,113,4.136363636363637
7867220,5,6304278853,"If you don't feel this one, you're doing it wrong.  The movements are small and concentrated--and very effective.  Keli's instruction is great.  This is so much more effective than traditional abdominal exercises.",1100044800,4,213,5.59375
7867221,3,6304278853,"This video's a little out-of-date but still a pretty good workout.  It's very different from the usual crunches, etc., which is why I like it but,as other reviewers have said, it's sometimes boring and she doesn't necessarily go with the rhythm of the music.  Still, it's a great ab  workout if you did two or three segments together.",963187200,,334,4.724137931034483
7867222,3,6304278853,"This video does have some really good ab work.  However, it is not very exciting and interesting.  Therefore, you will not want to keep coming back to do this video.  The video is broken into segments and each segments'  exercises get more and more difficult, with the last segment being very  difficult.  The problem with the video is that like one customer said in a  previous review this video is a little slow moving.  In additon, you also  have to keep changing the equipment you are using. For instance for one  segment you need a step, but for another you just need a mat and towel.  I  tried this video once or twice but I had a hard time getting myself to do  it on a routine basis.  I found that The Methods: Precision Toning video  with Jennifer Kries, which uses Pilates exercises was much more effective  for abs and a lot more fun to do.  In fact, this tape is about an hour  long, which is twice the length's of Keli's, but the time goes by much  quicker.  Also, for a real nice quick 20 minute workout for abs, Living  Arts Yoga Ab workout for beginners with Rodney Yee is very good.  Finally,  another great tape is Karen Voight's Streamline to Fitness.  The second  half of this tape is 30 minutes and has a great ab and back workout as well  as pushups and Yoga stretching moves at the end.  I do like Keli's Circuit  Training workout a lot, but this one just didn't cut it compared to the  other workout videos currently out there.",949017600,4,1451,4.349624060150376
