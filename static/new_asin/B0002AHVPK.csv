2073502,2,B0002AHVPK,"I wish I could give this a better rating because I had high hopes.  I am only 1 hour into it and I am already frustrated.  This is entitled ""Beginner's ASP.NET"" right?  The sound quality is not good.  The instructor seems to know his stuff, but his speaking style is not very dynamic and he sounds like he's talking through a cheap Radio Shack microphone installed in a cardboard box.  After 30 minutes of 10-minutes-worth of rambling background information about ASP and ASP.NET, I find out that he is going to use C# for his examples.

Given that this is BEGINNING ASP.NET, and the ENTIRE population of ASP programmers has been using VB Script, you would think they would use VB for the code examples.  Instead they are using a language that few have mastered yet.  If you have already mastered C# then the likelihood is that you are not going to purchase a ""beginners"" DVD.  So what were they thinking?

Don't buy this DVD unless you are already proficient in C+ or C#, and like DVDs with poor sound quality.  Otherwise stick with a book until someone else does a better job.",1096761600,2,1078,4.533678756476684
8025252,3,B0002AHVPK,"Decent book for a new asp programmer, but this is an older edition",1456963200,,66,4.153846153846154
8025253,2,B0002AHVPK,The content was good but it was painful to watch and listen to. The code samples are not available. The web site doesn't exists.,1126828800,4,128,4.375
8025254,1,B0002AHVPK,"This is not a professionally done video course.  It's just Neal Ford sitting in Front of his PC and droning on while he rapidly mouseclicks from one screen to the next.

Neal Ford is not a gifted speaker.  He talks in  a nasal monotone which begins to grate after a while.  To make matters worse the sound quality is terrible, really its below home video quality, and it's just hard to hear what he says.  After one chapter I couldn't stand to listen to it anymore.

IMO Amazon owes me a refund for this piece of junk.",1126656000,,518,4.278350515463917
8025255,2,B0002AHVPK,"The sound quality was so bad that either I was turning up the volumn or being shouted down by it. Although the material was good and effective the presentation seemed not to have been well thought out. There were constant stops in the program just when the material was getting good. By the time it started again I had been distracted and had to start over. If they had given the content twice as much time between breaks and produced the CD correctly in reference to the sound quality, I think it would have been a very good product. Here's hoping they get it right next time.",1122249600,2,577,4.401869158878505
8025256,5,B0002AHVPK,"It is not really for a beginner.  If you are a programmer and want to learn ASP, this will save you time.  You will want to review sections of the dvd or use after doing a little reading.  Glad it uses C#, much better langauge the VB.net.  Tech instruction is useless unless you write code, so write some code too.",1110499200,,314,4.183333333333334
8025257,5,B0002AHVPK,"sound quality not optimal, but overall a very good start.",1109548800,,57,4.8
8025258,2,B0002AHVPK,"I should have looked at reviews of other DVDs from this publisher.  Sounds (and appears on presenter) like a cheap lapel mic scraping across a collar button, plus various crackling and pops.  But a few lessons sound very clear, so it wasn't the disc.  Solid introduction to ASP.net veers tragically off course with irrelevant intro to O-O programming in VB.  Too bad, since he's a pretty good presenter, and I learned some really useful details not clear in other sources.",1108252800,4,472,4.8625
8025259,4,B0002AHVPK,"Very good to get an overview over ASP.NET with C#. The only downside is the really bad audio quality. If your time is worth more than $5 an hour, buy this DVD. It can save you a lot of time.",1102377600,2,190,3.775
8025260,5,B0002AHVPK,"This DVD was great. Unlike what other reviewers say, this is a very good introduction to NEW Asp. As you all know, Microsoft is pushing C# as their new top language. So, if you are a programmer and want to prolong you stay in the U.S for at least 2 more years, you better switch to C#. Why? Because it's a new language, and it gives you a better chance of competing with out-sourced programmers who heavily use Vb.net. All in all, if you want to learn CASP# by tomorrow, buy this one.",1101340800,3,484,4.21505376344086
8025261,2,B0002AHVPK,"The guy just rambles on and on... Audio quality is horrible...

If you are very new to C# and Visual Studio you might learn a few basics... but it's hard to get through. This is the only reason why I didn't give it only 1 star

I wish I had listed to the first reviewer.",1100131200,,270,3.890909090909091
