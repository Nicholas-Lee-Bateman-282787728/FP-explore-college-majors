8423390,4,B004CQGGK6,"Jake provides some real standout arrangments. Despite a lack of tab, he articulates his ideas and musical concepts well. A pdf with the tab would have made this a stellar package. While I have played long enough to remember transcribing from tapes and videos, younger musicians do not, and will not, be willing to put in the additional effort. It's an oversight that will ultimately limit sales.",1393545600,,395,4.91044776119403

I would've given this 5 STARS if it came with sheet music!",1381449600,2,161,4.03125
8423392,3,B004CQGGK6,"DVD is very good and he is a very good player and teacher but I was disappointed to see no TAB and sheet music.

I would've given this 5 STARS if it came with TAB and Sheet Music...",1378771200,3,181,3.763157894736842
8423393,3,B004CQGGK6,"The music he demonstrates is prerry good, but there's apparently no music written out, so it'll take a long time to transcribe these solos. It's doable, I guess. I just assumed there was going to be a notation booklet, as there was for his ""Jazz Classics"" dvd- a great set of music too.",1370476800,7,286,4.415094339622642
8423394,4,B004CQGGK6,"This is a good collection of songs and the arrangements are excellent. It takes time to learn them, and a couple are not easy to get, however its well worth the effort. No tab or sheet music though.",1366588800,,198,4.2368421052631575

Big Yellow Taxi
Crazy
Deacon Blues
Don't Know Why
I Heard It Through the Grapevine
Michelle
Steppin' Out
You Are So Beautiful

By learning this diverse collection you can see inside the approach and develop them further yourself if you choose. Jakes Guitar style is to provide a bass line, melody and hooks plus a percussive element that stays very true to the original songs intent without being so slavish as to make them impossible to play. These arrangements are not just simple alternating bass and melody or arpeggiated chords. NOT for the absolute beginner as it takes some dexterity but all are approachable. There is not too much 'jazz' harmonization just to be clever (not that jake isn't capable of such things) that in the hands of many might mask the songs. Some songs are obviously 'jazzy' such as steely dan's 'deacan blues, or nora jone's 'don't know why' and joe jackson's 'steppin out' while others are pop and soul classics. The tunes are played and then some of the thinking and technique are shown, but no 'fluff' in the instruction.

I suppose what marks Jakes approach is his groove and many jazz players could find this instructive on how to approach popular songs and keep things interesting. For any player, the 'puzzle' of pulling off the trick of playing complete songs on the instrument is at least worth dabbling with. Jake takes the essentials, knows what to leave out and what details to include and finds them without 'silly stretches' or alternate tunings.

A comparison might be made with Tuck Andress' approach but far more approachable and a good primer if heading in that direction, Tuck is great but his material can come off as 'super human' while Jake's arrangements can be accomplished with a bit of diligence and lead you on to doing your own of favorite tunes should you desire.

Any of these arrangements would be great to be able to play to any audience or to impress...but you will also get a great feel for how a whole song works, not just the 'guitar part' or 'solo' that plagues many a guitar player. Highly recommend and with these 8 varied but popular songs an absolute bargain!

PS...I live in Australia and although listed as region 1, I contacted the publisher HL and was assured they are not region coded, it plays perfectly well down here on a domestic DVD player.

PPS...although a glowing review, I am not affiliated with JR, just an admirer and after seeing this DVD, have gone on to buy more materials from Jake to learn still more...check out youtube for more pop classics or more jazz oriented material, but this is a great selection and overview of this style that is becoming increasingly popular for guitar players to be able to do.",1313625600,10,2896,4.700197238658777
