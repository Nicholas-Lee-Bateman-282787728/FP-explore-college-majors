8579756,2,B00CBDG59O,"All American Horror: Gateways To Hell is a pretty mediocre documentary. It isn't really bad or pointless but it barely offers anything fresh to the legends it explores. A few of the locations are heavy traffic spots for paranormal investigators and tourists alike. I venture to say that there is nothing new in this docu that really adds to those tales. The segments dealing with the woman of the tunnel, the cemetery gates and Lucifer thumbing a ride are all very creepy and entertaining to watch. They are also less explored than the other ghostly hot-spots. My biggest irritant was the fact that some of the interviewees and people highlighted seemed a bit scripted or too far fetched to be credible. If you really like documentaries about the paranormal then give this one a peek but I personally wasn't all that impressed with what it offers. I do have to give credit to background atmospheric shots, of the locations that worked into the segments, because they were creepy and eerie visual treats.",1432598400,,1003,4.837209302325581

Some highlights to visit: DEVIL'S STAIRS in North Carolina ( Wait there is alot of Spooky in N. C and the South),Serious WHY would you want to temp Lucifer or whoever is doing ""That Mr Bojangles routine up & down this staircase,Shirley Temple would pass on it.""
HANGING HOUSE in Wilmington,N.C.,So LIKE ""Amityville"" house this one was REALLY built on a grave site and the bones don't like you walking over them.
CEMETERY GATES in N.Y., So all those cable shows that preach re-use or refurbishing,Would NEVER re-do these (period).
HAUNTED HOSPITAL in Kentucky,YIKES ! The place where they sent TB patients to die and some nurses are still there haunting for patients Hundreds of years later.
RAILROAD PHANTOM,From who knows where ? So,She may have been murdered and thrown from the train by an ex,Or jumped from train to her death,Or strolled into its path....Well,Its a fact she is dead and haunting these rails !",1370908800,,1101,4.893048128342246
