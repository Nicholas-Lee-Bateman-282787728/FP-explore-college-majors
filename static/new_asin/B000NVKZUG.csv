2784288,3,B000NVKZUG,".... I must admit that I felt having Hitler, Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt sitting at their desks watching movies of each other a little strange. Surely they had better things to do with their time.",1372291200,,200,4.742857142857143
2784289,3,B000NVKZUG,"It could have been because my husband and I were tired that night but it felt as if the movie moved quite slow.  Very informative though in how Hitler (German leader), Stalin (Russian Leader), Churchill (England's leader) and Roosevelt (USA's leader)all thought of each other and mis-judged each other at times.  It seemed to be a mind chess game between all the leaders.  This movie focused in on WWII.",1275436800,,403,4.811594202898551
2784290,5,B000NVKZUG,This is a must own for the World War II buff or those who want to understand the Cold War.  Holds your attention.  Well documented.  Excellent source.,1269561600,2,150,4.481481481481482
2784291,5,B000NVKZUG,"We know the generalities of WWII, but this set of DVDs shows the subtle power play between the warlords that we didn't know. We find out through diary entries of aides, cabinet members, and principals just what thoughts were behind the actions taken. Personalities played an important role in trust and alliances and those alliances were constantly shifting and being tested. There are many pivotal points on which the outcome of the war and the divisions of Eastern Europe might have been very different had different tacks been taken.",1230336000,11,536,5.033707865168539
2784292,5,B000NVKZUG,"Warlords is verry informative.  Hitler and Stalin I knew about, I was surprised about FDR and Churchill.  I highly recommend it to all my friends.",1224460800,6,146,4.8
2784293,5,B000NVKZUG,"As a lifelong student of the Second World War, as well as the son and nephew of men who fought under one of the ""Warlords"" (FDR), I am amazed at the skuldugery that exisisted between them. FDR was married to the American people-they were his power base,-and had provided him the almost Imperial power of three terms in office-as well as his wartime fourth. It was FDR's destiny to never betray the American people-even at the expense of lying to his wonderful friend Winston Churchill. Churchill on the other hand may have had an American mother, but his soul belonged to the British Empire-Churchill was prepared to prostitute himself to FDR (Franklin Delano Roosevelt),-or court the beast Stalin,-if it would lead to the destruction of Hitler. Stalin pretty much had figured out Churchill and Roosevelt accurately-their only interest in dealing with Stalin, was to defeat Hitler,and deny Russia supreamacy in post-WWII Europe. Stalin best summed things up when he asked the following question about the Catholic Pope: ""How many divisions does the Pope have?"" As for Hitler, thanks to Hitler's declaration of war on both the Americans and Russians in 1941-Hitler assured his destruction and that of his Italian and Japanese partners. Warlords reveals the suspicious and self-seeking aims of even such divine personalities as Roosevelt and Churchill. Once again proving the addage that:""politics does indeed make strange bedfellows!""",1179619200,19,1433,5.262008733624454
8181737,5,B000NVKZUG,"This series comes as billed, real page-turning history from a very unique perspective, four leaders who fought in World War II, but also fought each other, sometimes with absolute genius, other times with utter folly.  People could learn a thing or two about this perspective of WWII.",1516665600,,284,5.042553191489362
8181738,5,B000NVKZUG,"Hello Nathan, ""Warlords"" is worth a look. It deals more with the mental aspect of the leaders of WW ll. Acorn Media tends to be good stuff. The service was excellent and the transaction was painless. Many Thanks. Charles",1516233600,,220,4.666666666666667
8181739,5,B000NVKZUG,"Very interesting. Real footage with commentary. I like the fact that it paints Roosevelt and Churchill as they really were, not as they pretended to be. But Churchill is still the one who was closest to telling the truth. To say it nicely, Roosevelt was a true politician.",1506124800,,272,4.6875

8181741,5,B000NVKZUG,"I am a self learned WW2 history buff, and this video gives information not found in many videos. The tension between allied leaders is very interesting, and not in many history books. Interesting to say the least. A no brainer for ww2 buffs like me.",1497916800,,249,4.555555555555555

8181744,5,B000NVKZUG,"PLOT: CLOSE UP VIEW OF THE LEADERS OF WW2~ outstanding~

1939~ the MINDSET of Hitler, Stalin, FDR and Churchill and how each of them made decisions.

Volume one: Hitler VS Stalin~ how these two managed to set up a DEAL to carve up Poland and why they decided to do it. Some great footage of Stalin that we rarely see.

Volume two: Churchill VS Roosevelt~ The two allies that had lots of differences including some new info on how INDECISIVE FDR could be at times.

Volume three: Churchill VS Stalin~ Strong personality Churchill found Stalin could not be reasoned with or trusted most of the time.

Volume four: Roosevelt VS Stalin~ the failing fragile President and the Communist were strange bedfellows indeed.

** TOLD MOSTLY from diaries and letters and interviews** well done and entertaining but mostly worth watching for the NEW films of the leaders and how they MOSTLY could not trust or did NOT understand each other. 5 STARS~",1428537600,,935,4.77639751552795
