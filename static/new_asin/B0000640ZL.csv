7960239,3,B0000640ZL,"I find Caveh's honesty affecting.  I cannot admit to myself certain flaws in my character; Caveh puts everything wrong and wonderful about himself on screen.  This film is an interesting look at an idea quickly abandoned (one minute of each day of one year filmed), in which the essence of the idea remains (we see the progress of a year in a very perfunctory, but not uninsightful, way).  The movie is more interesting to remember than to watch, though.  It was particularly interesting for me to see the little pleasures in life being represented straightforwardly (Caveh's awful dancing to a song that he likes, etc.).

The same can be said about the short film included, ""I Was Possessed By God.""  It appears that hallucinogenics do not destroy the ego, as many believe, yet this study of a particular ""trip"" does have its moments and some insights into Zahedi and ""possession by God"".",1158278400,,889,4.815789473684211

7960241,5,B0000640ZL,This is certainly a film that will appeal to some more than others. I personally found it to be one of the best studies of a film maker's persona that I have ever seen. I enjoyed every moment of the year 1999 set with Caveh and Mandy.,1038009600,3,234,4.0
