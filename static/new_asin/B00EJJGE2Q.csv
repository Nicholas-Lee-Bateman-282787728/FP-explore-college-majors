Her videos were always among the best in The Firm franchise, the ones I went to time and again (still do). She maintains that quality with these Focus and Longevity series. She's just good. Intensity throughout, great cuing, fun choreography, but not overly complicated. I always feel like I got a good workout and didn't waste my time. And you will see results.

Her workouts won't be easy for beginners. But if you want to start out with them, there's nothing wrong with doing 5 minutes, then working up to 10, then 12, then 15. (Make sure to cool down properly even if you cut it short!) Just keep at it and you'll get there. The first time you finally complete the whole thing, your feeling of accomplishment will be worth it.",1531440000,,854,4.4743589743589745
