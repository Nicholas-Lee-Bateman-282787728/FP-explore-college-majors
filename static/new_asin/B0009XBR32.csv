8069391,4,B0009XBR32,I found Discipline on the Progressive Rock Archives web site and loved Canto IV (Limbo) Bought more Disipline on I Tunes and fell in love with all their music. They have long broken up and Matthew P. has some good solo stuff out. Since I knew I would never get the chance to see them live a concert video seemed like a resonable alternative. I have many and this one is well done. I'd wish they had more of Into the Dream on it. Matthew P. is intense. I especially enjoyed the early version of the band and to see on one video how they progessed through the years. I would recommend this video for anyone that likes the music because we will probably never get to see them live. Great progressive rock band from the late 80's and early 90's.,1302307200,2,741,4.26241134751773
8069392,5,B0009XBR32,"If you were like me a fan of Discipline, the prog band from Detroit, who
gave us two great albums during the nineties, jump on this DVD and you'll
never regret it ! To start with the 1995 concert itself, it's nice to know
that the best songs from their first album ''Push and profit'' are played.
Diminished,Carmilla,Blueprint and Nursery year sounds even better live. As
for the song Canto IV(In limbo),we are granted with an early version here.
Included also in the live performance are two rare songs,Circuitry and
When the walls are down. What a shame that this song never was recorded on
a Discipline album. Concerning the extras, two songs from the very early
stage of Discipline deserves to be mentionned,Piddle-A-Dink(from 1988)and
Man in transition(from 1992).''When she dreams...she dreams in color'' should have been on the album Unfolded like staircase. Fortunatly, we are
blessed with a 1998 rendition of their epic song(almost 23 minutes long!)
''Into the dream"""".It took 10 years before this great show was issued on
DVD but the wait was worth it.",1228176000,3,1062,4.97191011235955
