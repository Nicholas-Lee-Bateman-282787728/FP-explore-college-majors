5666942,4,B00BQRBIS4,"I enjoyed this, and I hope it makes it into indie theaters. Wonderful acting with subtlety where it is called for.  It's a movie for adults who like thoughtful, wry humor organically derived from a family of richly drawn yet dysfunctional characters.

5666945,5,B00BQRBIS4,"So different from Sling Blade that you might never have realized it's Thornton again.  This is as good as Sling Blade, but has a completely different perspective and much more complexity.  The writers certainly exhibit an intimate knowledge of the South during this era.  Duvall is wonderfully crusty and eccentric, and John Hurt provides a perfect foil.  Ron White nails his performance, effectively pillorying the people he enjoys caricaturing the most.  There's a lot going on in this film, and I found it to be intelligent and engrossing.  Well, Thornton's no one trick pony, that much is certain.",1377561600,27,601,5.081632653061225

5666948,5,B00BQRBIS4,"I love this movie and can't get enough of it. An alternate title could have been ""strange obsessions"", but this title represents the complete wreck that is this family. I have lived my whole life in Alabama and so many things are spot on, from the ""favorite spot in the woods for parking and hunting "" to the politics and conflicting feelings about family and religion and the sexual repression/revolution which can only lead to dysfunction in all these areas.  It isn't for everybody, but after ""giving it a chance"", I must add it to my favorite movie list. Certainly better than anything made in the last 5 years with their contrived and politically ""policed"" social themes, which I have given up on watching.

I love Duvall, one of the best damn actors since John Wayne. Billy Bob grew up not 25 miles from my home, how he got so creepy I don't know. The movie is strange and very unlike the south.

5666966,4,B00BQRBIS4,"[Rounded up from 3-1/2 stars, after debating on 3 or 4 stars/Minor Spoilers] Besides the interesting title (which is actually explained in the movie), this one definitely peaked my interest with such an impressive cast, including:  Billy Bob Thornton (who's also the writer and director, as he was in ""Sling Blade,"" though ""Jayne Mansfield's Car"" is not quite up on that same level), Robert Duvall, John Hurt, Kevin Bacon, Robert Patrick (""Terminator 2:  Judgment Day"") and yes (comedian) Ron White (who can act just fine, thank you, and steals the movie, in my opinion, even if it's a supporting role).  Set in 1969, Duvall plays the patriarch of a southern family whose wife has left him decades earlier, and even after she's found a new husband (in England, no less) and passes away (off screen), her body is returned to her home in the U.S. for burial, thus bringing together her first family, if you will, and her second family, complete with two grown stepchildren and widower who her biological kids and ex-husband have never met (though how some of them get to know one other, so to speak, could definitely be interpreted as inappropriate).  Naturally, there's quite a disparity in familial personalities and no lack of drama (it's definitely not uninteresting), though what it all yields could be construed as ambiguously satisfying, including a few scenes that just don't work, especially the final scene, which seems out of place (the second-to-last scene felt like a good ending).  But the most mysterious part of the film is why these scenes were left in and why Tippi Hedren's (""The Birds"") scenes were cut (it's been reported that she played the role of Duvall's ex-wife, though it's unclear if these were flashback scenes with dialogue or just her lying in the coffin, like Kevin Costner did in ""The Big Chill"").  Recommended for fans of the leads, just the same, and if nothing else for Ron White's surprising command performance.  [Viewer Warning:  There are several post-car-accident scenes in the film with fatalities that are, of course, fictional but could still bring back sad or traumatic memories for some.]",1472601600,,2132,4.985915492957746

5666969,3,B00BQRBIS4,"With a cast like that you'd think I would have loved it. However, I did not.  I could not empathize with anyone in the family. It was about a miserable family with not much hope for the future and where home life consisted of an empty void only holding space until death would bring relief. It was the kind of movie that would make a person steer clear of the deep South. The depictions used was basically of a red neck family too uptight to live,  struggling within their own chains; incarcerated within the walls of tradition and ideology.

5666975,3,B00BQRBIS4,"I love Duvall, and enjoy most things with BBT, but this one let me down. Many unexplained character back stories, none of the adults were happily married, and aside from that, it appeared that no one had a job, yet they could afford to live in this beautiful antebellum mansion with a maid, numerous cars and a swimming pool. Also, the characters' ages seemed off for the time period, i.e. the movie took place in 1969, and the 3 sons were all veterans of WW2 25 years earlier - they didn't look old enough, especially Bacon. I was disappointed in this movie, was hoping for something as good as Slingblade.

5666976,3,B00BQRBIS4,Viewed this last night - it was difficult to like the characters or to be interested in them.

The title doesn't really fit the story and the interaction between Billy Bob Thornton's character and his English step--sister were disgusting and added nothing to the movie at all.,1445817600,,397,4.823529411764706

5666983,5,B00BQRBIS4,"Ha, a Billy Bob Thornton ensemble film!  Who'd a thunk.  The history behind this supposed car is a whole 'nother thing.  Our ""Olivia"" of L&O SVU certainly has the Gods to thank that she was laying down safely asleep in the backseat of her mom & Mickey's car.  The movie itself - not so unlike other intertwined Southern family films, but still a bit different.  These men are all drenched in their own personal war experiences.  Near impossible for anyone of them to understand a different experience at a different time in a different war.  Sad.  They were all brave & deserve recognition by their own family at the very least.  My school friends faught in Vietnam, but it wasn't hard to understand all the other ""war"" points of view...very surprising for me.

5666984,5,B00BQRBIS4,"I love a good ensemble film, where acting and writing rule the day. Films like""Rambling Rose"" and ""The Big Chill"" win my heart fair and square, and here's another one. It's tempting to discuss this in detail, but that would involve spoilers. I don't do spoilers, so suffice it to say this. A brilliant ensemble cast takes a story of two deeply dysfunctional families, one southern USA, one British, unites them through the death of a mostly unseen character, and the sparks fly. I love Robert Duvall; he is ever a poet, and nowhere more than in this flinty turn as the patriarch of the southern family. Robert Patrick is steely as a father who takes after his own. Kevin Bacon gives a performance of immense strength and sympathy as the son who has rebelled against family values. John Hurt brings to the role of the British father channels of darkness that reveal themselves only gradually, and in remarkable ways. We are not so different. The film takes place in 1969, the height of the Vietnam conflict and a time of schism in America that would not be seen again until the present day. While the actual time is less relevant than those who live it, it presents a fine battleground for three generations of war wounded. It explores questions of love and attraction, of pain and bandages, of loyalty and family, and much more. I can't be more specific without doing a disservice to a fine and surprisingly warm- if spiky - work by Billy Bob Thornton, who both directed and co-wrote a scrappy ode to how we define ourselves by our pain. I can't recommend this film highly enough, except to say I watched it on two successive nights and was delighted both times, and that after the first viewing I dreamed about some of the characters. ***** bobbogoldberg 1/13/14",1431388800,,1763,4.653846153846154

Billy Bob Thornton never ceases to amaze me with his talent along with Robert Duvall and all the other actors/actresses.  This movie will make you see what war has done mentally/emotionally to these soldiers of the era and will almost make you cry, but will also make you laugh.

Don't want to give much away because this movie is a must see.  But listed are some key points.
  Viet Nam era, mental/emotional issues with 3 brothers
  A father (Robert Duvall) obsessed with vehicle accidents and his ham radio.
  A sister married to an alcoholic car dealer salesman.

5667010,2,B00BQRBIS4,"Billy Bob Thornton wants to be the great Everyone.  Writer, director, actor,....etc.  He hit his peak with ""Slingblade"", and it is a gem.  This film is a muddled mess.  And, yes, I lived through the era (in college from 1967 - 1971).  While I knew some Viet Nam vets who were against the VN war, I never met a WWII vet who was, at least not militantly so.  So that removed any validity or honesty from Kevin Bacon character for me.  And while Robert Duvall is a great actor, he is given little to work with here, other than much muttering and gazing at the horizon.

For the record, I get why the patriarch is fascinated with carnage.  Has something to do with his seeing so much death in France as a medic during WWI.  Thus the title of the film, and the viewing of the car(s) and bodies.  This whole enterprise, however, is just too self-important.  As one who grew up in the north but has chosen to live in the deep south for the past 45 years, I see the typical Hollywood errors, such as the usage of ""y'all"" in the singular and accents which are slightly off.  But it is the straining for relevance (inter-generational, multicultural attitudes about warfare) bordering on psychosis which I found so disappointing.

The title sounded interesting too; I'd heard about the car wreck involving Jayne Mansfield's car and thought a story built around it may be interesting.  But a movie with this many stars that I'd never heard of?  BIG RED FLAG!  But, what the heck, I took a chance.  But I'll cut to the chase; this movie has NOTHING to do with the crash of Mansfield's car.  Oh, there is a scene where some of the characters visit a travelling display of the mangled Mansfield car, but that's it.  Robert Duvall plays a mumbling crank of an old man - and hardly an endearing one.  Billy Bob starts off playing a variation on his Sling Blade character who, we find out later, is a hero Navy pilot from WWII!  Except it's not believable.  Set in 1969, many of the characters intentionally or accidentally take mind altering drugs.  Think maybe this plot was concocted with their use because it really goes off the rails.  Maybe you gotta be high to understand it; I wasn't, so it just didn't appeal to me.",1397952000,,1136,4.403846153846154
5667017,5,B00BQRBIS4,"I thought this was a really interesting movie. Echoes of World War II (and even a bit of WW I) in the Vietnam era. A couple of scenes were a little over the top (e.g., the part during Duvall's hilarious encounter with LSD where the shotgun came out), but if you like eclectic movies laced with dark humor (and aren't bummed out by the salty language that peppers this film), you'll probably like this as much as I did. If you liked the British production of ""Death at a Funeral"", for example, you'll love this one. Excellent cast (Robert Duvall, Billy Bob Thornton, Kevin Bacon, Ron White) and at times they captured 1969 as well as any movie I've seen about that era ever has.  As my title says, this movie won't be for everybody, but I think those who like dark comedy will most likely find it to be tremendously entertaining.

Updated 11/15/14:

I rarely watch the same movie twice, particularly if I've seen it in the fairly recent past, but I recently saw ""The Judge"", and after recognizing the many parallels between ""The Judge"" and this movie, I wanted to see this one again.  I watched it for the second time last night and appreciated it even more.  I enjoyed it far more than ""The Judge"" and consider it to be a superior film to ""The Judge"".  The performances of the entire cast of ""Jayne Mansfield's Car"" - from Robert Duvall and Billy Bob Thornton to Kevin Bacon and Ron White - were outstanding.  Virtually every scene is interesting in its own right and a few of them - make that many of them - are absolutely hilarious.  Billy Bob Thornton's performance should have garnered him at least an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.

I've upgraded my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  This is a fantastic movie for those who appreciate the genre.",1397433600,6,1756,4.511041009463723

5667023,4,B00BQRBIS4,"""Jayne Mansfield's Car"" (2012 release; 122 min.) brings the story of two families, one American, one British, who seemingly couldn't be further apart. As the movie opens, we are told that we are in ""Alabama, 1969"" and we get to know the Caldwell clan, with Jim Caldwell (played by Robert Duvall) as the patriarch, and his kids, including brothers Skip (played by Billy Bob Thornton), Carroll (played by Kevin Bacon) and Alan (played by Marshall Allman). One day, a phone call comes in the England, with the new that Jim's ex-wife (she had divorced him and remarried some guy in England) has died and her will was to be buried in Alabama. Her English husband and his (adult) son and daughter are soon arriving in Alabama, and a clash of cultures sets in. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie was directed and co-written by Billy Bob Thornton, so you can say that this is his labor of love. Second, it takes quite a while for this movie to ""find its groove"" but when it does, I was actually taken in by it. Indeed, while there is quite a bit of attention to the culture clash and the fact that Americans and Brits are ""separated by language"" (Skip to the British woman: ""your accent sure is pretty!""), the main theme that emerges is that all the men were involved in one way or another in WWII. The best moment of the movie comes when Skip and the British woman are alone, and Skip finally lets his guard go and recounts the full story of what happened to him as a Navy pilot in WWII, more than 25 years ago. Be ready to be surprised...

This movie was announced sometime in Fall of 2013 at my local art house theatre here in Cincinnati as ""coming soon"", but for whatever reason never made it here. I had pretty much forgotten about this when I happen to notice the DVD, so I just had to pick it up and check it out. Bottom line: yes, there are weak stretches in this movie, in particular in the first hour, but the second hour made up for it in my book. If you are interested in a different take on how war affects people's lives over the long run and in some unexpected ways, I'd say this is worth checking out.",1389657600,3,2238,4.3389021479713605
5667024,5,B00BQRBIS4,"Billy Bob Thornton, co-wrote, directed, and acts in this depiction of a military family during 1969 in Morrison Alabama.  A character study, of sorts, about the diverse ways each of the family members considers their present day lives through the looking glass of their individual pasts, mainly their time spent in the military.  The vast differences shown in these people all culminate because of the death of Naomi.  She was the mother of the three boys, Jimbo (Robert Patrick), an Army man not seeing in any combat, Skip (Billy Bob Thornton), a Navy man, Carroll (Kevin Bacon), a Marine and presently a Vietnam protester, and daughter, Donna (Katherine LaNasa). Also included in the cast is Donna's husband, Neal (Ron White).  He adds realistic comic relief into this familial themed and darkly comedic look into dysfunctional family life after having returned home from the wars (WWI and WWII).  That isn't to say that this movie does not have its lighter moments as there are plenty.

Naomi's ex-husband, Jim Caldwell (Robert Duvall), was not the sort of person that could give her what she needed.  He is very short on patience, emotion, or the display of it, and certainly, tolerance.  Because she needed so much more in her life, she divorced him and moved on to remarry Kingsley Bedford (John Hurt, in a multilayered role) in England and continue her life there with his family, Phillip (Ray Stevenson), and Camilla (Francis O'Connor).  Jim and Naomi's relationship isn't shown, but is spoken of often. Jim remained in Alabama raising their children to adulthood and watched them each head off into one or another part of military service.  All three of the sons, along with their father, differ in their personal conclusions of wartime except for knowing that it equally changed their opinions on life.

Jim Caldwell is a complicated, and, mostly, an uncompromising man except during the hours he obsessively listens to his radio.  He endlessly waits for an automobile accident or a tragic local wreck, sometimes being the first to arrive at the scene.  While many may find this a very obsessive commitment, I saw it much differently.  During his time in the war Jim was a medic caring for soldiers in urgent need of medical care, some near death if even alive.  Much later in the film he states to Kingsley, with great compassion, that there were times the wounded men were only offered a short drink of booze and a prayer.  He goes to the scenes of accidents now for these injured people because it gives him the purpose which he had in the Army; a much higher purpose than a complacent family life which seems to just frustrate him.

The two separate families of Naomi come together for the funeral and things finally take a friendly turn for the lively blend especially the husbands, past and most recent.  They begin a familiar discourse, an ability to see that a thing such as communication within a family is strained regardless of nationality, history, and children.  Take the character of Skip, a complex and intricate man who actually made my heart hurt with his sufferings.  For that matter, so did Carroll.  Their private pain is intolerable.  The very last scene of the movie concerning Carroll absolutely stole my breath away; I could not tear my eyes from his face.

This is an intriguing, ensemble cast movie for those who do enjoy thinking about all of the reasons why.  I found myself asking questions constantly while at first some things seemed so very odd then soon made perfect sense.  That goes for the title of the movie also, ""Jayne Mansfield's Car"".",1389571200,10,3585,4.847290640394089
5667025,1,B00BQRBIS4,"Where was the car? I wish the car had told the story. Never have seen Kevin Bacon give a bad performance, so either me or the director were a miss on this. Where was the car? Insensitive title and a rude southern themed movie.",1389225600,,226,4.159090909090909
5667026,4,B00BQRBIS4,"JAYNE MANSFIELD'S CAR (USA/Russia-2012) stars Robert Duvall, John Hurt, Billy Bob Thornton (who also scripted and directed), Robert Patrick and Kevin Bacon, with small roles for Shawnee Smith (TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BECKER/dp/B0012EM5DS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BECKER</a>), Tippi Hedrin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BIRDS/dp/B00COHGOES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BIRDS</a>) and Brent Briscoe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-SIMPLE-PLAN/dp/6305417830/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A SIMPLE PLAN</a>).

It's a guy's film, but not in a disgusting or violent way. This drama explores with some sensitivity three generations of a family from a small Alabama town. The patriarch, Jim (Duvall) is a WWI vet who spends his days monitoring the police band so he can visit the scenes of car accidents.

His oldest son (Thornton) is 50 and still at home. ""Skip"" was a WWII pilot who crashed and sustained major burns. He's very much lost in the past, is like a big child and has three sports cars that are named for various fighter planes. The youngest, Carroll (Bacon), also a WWII vet, is now a dedicated anti-war protester and a hippie in his personal life. Carroll's own son is 18 and he's thinking of enlisting for service overseas. Naturally his peacenik dad hates the idea. The middle son (Patrick), Jimbo has a weight problem (it's strange seeing the T-1000 from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TERMINATOR-2/dp/0784010188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TERMINATOR 2</a>&nbsp;looking portly). The only Caldwell male who never served in the military, he's ashamed of that and resentful of his brothers.

Their mom, Naomi (Hedrin) left while the three were young. After a divorce from Jim she met an Englishman while vacationing in London. They married and had a family. Now it's over a quarter-century later and Naomi has died of cancer. Her last request was to be buried in her hometown, so the British family are coming to stay for a while. Each of them is equally quirky.

The main tension of the story is how both family groups interact, collectively and one-on-one. It's clear the Alabama family wants to hate their guests, yet a couple of unusual relationships quickly develop. (The one involving Skip may be a main reason this picture is rated R.)

I liked the story. It's no classic, but it's also not a bore. Worth a rental.",1389052800,,2515,6.033613445378151
5667027,5,B00BQRBIS4,Duvall as good as acting gets. Thornton is perfect. White just right. Stevenson and O` Conner nailed it. Thoroughly entertaining . Thankfully no car chases no explosions what a relief. Excellent film.,1388793600,,200,5.28125
5667028,2,B00BQRBIS4,"While the premise of opposing families ""coming together"" is the conceit, Jayne Mansfield's Car is, at its core, a film about men who cannot let go of war. The problem is we don't know why they can't let go.

Jim was a medic in World War I and now has a fascination with racing to car crash scenes to witness the devastating aftermath. (Remind me never to visit Morrison, by the waytoo many car crashes around there.) His being ""traumatized by war"" is a good place to start, but writer/director/star Billy Bob Thornton (Sling Blade) simply expects us to accept that as the answer, and it isn't good enough. We don't know what happened to him decades prior to make him act this way.

The same approach applies to Thornton's own character, Skip Caldwell (another of Jim's sons), who flew planes for the Navy in World War II. Skip is so obsessed with his naval career that he names his cars after planes and wears his dress whites to his mother's funeral. It's later suggested that he is looking for his father's approval, but it is also suggested that he has some type of psychological issue (which is also not examined). The latter is not only evidenced by general odd behavior, it's also on display when he asks his late mother's British stepdaughter, Camilla Bedford (Frances O'Connor, A.I. Artificial Intelligence), to recite literature to him in her British accent, while naked, so he can masturbate to that.

Skip's brothers, Jimbo (Robert Patrick, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Carroll also served in WWII and are no better developed. Jimbo saw no action in the war yet he is their father's favorite (why?), and while Carroll saw action, he came home and became a hippy stoner peacenik (why?) who protests Vietnam because, well, protesting Vietnam is the default go-to for hippy stoner peaceniks. (His overall timeline strains credulity as well.) The Brits are no better. Kingsley is also a WWI vet and his son, Phillip (Ray Stevenson, Thor), is a WWII vet, and they don't get along either, to the point of airing their dirty knickers in front of their host family.

As for the three women in the film (not counting the maid), two of them are promiscuous. It's perfectly fine for a woman to be promiscuous, of course, but at least give us some reason as to why, at least for the married one.

This is what you get throughout the whole film from Billy Bob the Writer: tired facsimiles of characters we have seen in other movies, most of which were done better or at least fleshed out more than here. It's as if Thornton bought a book for first-time writers about creating fictional characters and this is what the book told him to do. He then leaves the rest up to you to flesh out. Billy Bob the Director isn't much better. His technical execution lacks any kind of flow, with odd shot choices, overly lengthy lingering, and a fixation on random slow-motion shots. This two-hour movie would have been better servedfor what that's worthby shaving 20 minutes of uselessness (including a ridiculous sequence where Jim winds up on an accidental acid trip).

Thornton, like many of the other actors in this film, has an impressive resume, but when history revisits Jayne Mansfield's Car, it will be remembered as merely a footnote.

The anamorphic 1080p imagery is sharp, which is a mixed blessing. While it presents the viewer with a great pictureparticularly in the darker scenesit exposes some of the worst lighting choices I've seen in film this year. The crisp picture also exposes the sets. They don't look fake, they just don't look genuine. I kept thinking of historic vacation spots where tourists can walk through rooms ""just like folks had back then."" It's almost as if the designers tried so hard to get it right that they got it too right. All of the dialogue and ambient noise from the disc's Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio track are clear and discernible.

There is only one extra (seriously; there aren't even any trailers for other DVDs). It's a 9-minute behind-the-scenes that offers film clips and footage interspersed with actor interviews. It's remarkably vanilla.

5667036,4,B00BQRBIS4,"JAYNE MANSFIELD'S CAR is a film filled with many pleasures, including a host of brilliant performances and an uncanny recreation of a past time and place.

Set in 1969 rural Alabama, the multi-character story deals, in part, with how different generations of a family deal with the experience of war.  In this case, its the wealthy, dysfunctional Caldwell clan, headed by Robert Duvall, a WWI vet, father of three sons (Robert Patrick, Kevin Bacon and Billy Bob Thornton) and a daughter (Katherine LaNasa).
The three brothers are still suffering, in different ways, from their experiences during WWII, while the daughter is trapped in a marriage with two daughters and a boorish husband.

The death of Duvalls long estranged wife and the childrens mother forces many unspoken truths into the open.  The deceased womans second husband (John Hurt) and his two grown kids (Ray Stevenson, Frances OConnor) by his first wife travel from their home in England to attend her burial in her Alabama.  This family has its own dysfunctional elements that spark unexpected collisions, some of them romantic, with and within the Caldwell clan.

More of a black comedy rather than a straight drama, JAYNE MANSFIELD'S CAR was co-written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton.  Unfortunately, the parts (e.g. performances, individual scenes) are more effective than the film as a whole, which runs far too long and cant really decide on an ending.  Although all of the actors are superb and their scenes are well written, the overall movie might have been better served without such an abundance of intriguing characters.  By eliminating three or four of them, Thornton would have wound up with a tighter, less meandering picture.

The problem is: Which characters do you cut?
