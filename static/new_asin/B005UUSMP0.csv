4894742,2,B005UUSMP0,"Warning! This is not a family movie. I thought it was going to be about the horse and how he helped the family, but this plot line is very thin. It's mainly about a dysfunctional family. I should have turned it off when my husband got depressed from it. I was waiting for the good part, which never really came, except for a little reprieve at the end. The music however is beautiful and the scenery so that's why I gave it 2 stars. Now if you're more of a realist and can handle the dysfunction with no humor, you might like parts of this movie. I did enjoy the music and dance in the beginning and the horse scenes, but there were so few.",1332028800,2,640,4.128
4894743,2,B005UUSMP0,"Made-for-TV caliber movie, 'The Dark Horse,' is more about a dysfunctional family than a pale imitation of true story '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secretariat/dp/B0060D0Z0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secretariat</a>'.  A comparison to the best made dysfunctional family films shows what is lacking in this one.  Movies like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Royal-Tenenbaums-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0000640VJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Royal Tenenbaums (The Criterion Collection)</a>,' 'Ordinary People,' '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Miss-Sunshine/dp/B000MR1V22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Miss Sunshine</a>,' and even lesser works like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smart-People/dp/B006RXQA9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smart People</a>' rely on flair, color, humor, and quirkiness to enlighten and entertain.  Usually eccentricities flow from the characters, and problems simmer below the surface until tensions later come to a full boil.  Here everything is at a full boil from the beginning until some later tenderness has us almost rooting for the McSpadden family when it is consequentially too late.  While I believe the family's depicted dysfunction is more realistic than most movies, it is also more irritating.

The plot is about as cut and paste as you get.  A family reunion brings resentments and rivalry as the children and grandchildren gather at the McSpadden Puget Sound farm.  The father is suffering from some form of dementia--a fact that presents itself several days earlier to the audience than is made apparent to the family.  Two brothers share the same love interest:  one she started out with, and the other she married.  The patriarch, besides enduring untreated dementia, is a fading inventor who has been sitting on unpaid bills that are jeopardizing the family estate, and the matriarch is taken by an untamed horse whom she hopes will deliver them from their problems. Everything rests on either the realtors or the horse to bail them out.  The only thing original in this near (probable) autobiographical mish-mash is the dialogue, which is as true to life as it is cringe-worthy.

What makes movie great art is when it can resemble real life, but also transcend it.  Short of some skillful documentaries, it would take an expert hand to make a home video and make it into a top-notch movie.  ('<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/51-Birch-Street/dp/B004DA4CSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">51 Birch Street</a>' worked for me.)  While watching this film, it was consequentially late until I started remotely liking the characters.  (I nearly doubled over watching one scene when a woman tells her ex-lover that he had grown up just after he had a playground fight with his rival brother over her love.) Despite a few tender, better acted scenes, I found little to cheer for the McSpadden Family. Only Martin (Mark Dias) ""The Horse Whisperer"" is laid-back and likable throughout.

The movie is being promoted as one of redemption.  It is easy to beat up on a movie like this, but one could spend quality time watching '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Gift/dp/B004CQ3HVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Gift</a>,' or '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tuesdays-With-Morrie/dp/B00008L3SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tuesdays With Morrie</a>' for redemption; even the pleasant, but substandard 'Straight from the Heart' for clean romance; or any number of horse movies ('Secretariat,' 'The Black Stallion,' 'Seabiscuit,' 'Flicka') with much more satisfying results.  'The Dark Horse' is 'Secretariat' with a dash of 'The Horse Whisperer' channeled through a nighttime soap.  There is some admirable cinematography, and I while I enjoyed Byran Hagan's original music, I can't help but feel that the latter asset will be greeted as ho-hum by most, and neither ambiance is nearly enough to propel this substandard work.  In the end this unoriginal situation driven rather than character driven debacle is a bad suit for those hoping for squeaky clean entertainment.  Anyone wishing for purer venues will have their hopes flicker when they realize this film gives wholesome entertainment a bad name.",1331856000,2,4437,6.470389170896785
4894744,1,B005UUSMP0,"But since this movie is so freaking horrible just thought I'd add my two cents. As everyone else has said this movie plain old sucks!!!!! But what no one has yet mentioned is that the only person in this entire movie that knows how to ride the horses is the woman Patricia something, who actually lost the freestyle Dressage competition! Mom and dysfunctional daughter, neither of them have one freaking clue how to ride. Is it too much to ask to hire actors that gee I don't know know how to ride since this is supposed to be a horse type film???? In short DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!",1331596800,3,581,4.388888888888889
4894745,4,B005UUSMP0,"A Dark Horse is a competitor about whom very little is known. They don't show up on a chart of statistics. If they win it is completely unexpected, but they rarely win.

The Dark Horse in this movie isn't just the actual horse, it's everyone and everything, apparently even the movie itself. It's really not for kids. It's a coming home story, and a pretty sensitive and mature one.

It deals with lots of emotional issues. Loss of career, home, mental capacity, potential spouse. Some characters have made difficult choices that they have to live with, and some have difficult choices thrust upon them in the course of the events we are observing.

The cinematography and music are fantastic. The Orcas Island portrayed here is a truely beautiful place, and I loved the dance sequence in the beginning. It's nice to see a grown woman moving like that, and I think it sets the tone for the film.

If you are looking for action, or a feel good horsie flick, I do not recommend this film, but if you are ready for an immersive study of a family going through a difficult time, then this is your Dark Horse.",1331424000,6,1104,4.532663316582915
4894746,1,B005UUSMP0,"Like another reviewer, I rented this DVD from my local Redbox. My oldest daughter loves horses, and had been begging to see this. We assumed it would be a feel-good family flick about a horse, in the same vein as Secretariat, which we enjoyed.  The cover and movie description lead one to believe this. The movie starts out very slow, and proceeds to get even slower. The characters are dysfunctional and unlikeable.  The acting is poor. The focus of the movie is not the horse; rather it is about this dysfunctional family trying to deal with their father's Alzheimer's. My children were not only bored; we all found this movie very depressing. Definitely not the family film it is purported to be.",1331251200,4,699,4.721311475409836
4894747,1,B005UUSMP0,"In short this movie sucks and blows at the same time. It is a dark spot in cinematic history that is so dull and poorly acted and produced, that it is hard to quantify.

But I shall endeavor to do so anyway.

(You don't really have to read any farther, but in case you do, this is me just venting my frustration at having watched this dog of a pony show through to its long awaited end. Try not to fall asleep during my description of it's storyline.)

Look, I don't normally like to tear apart something that obviously was a labor of love. What kind of love I'm not really sure, because the hours, days, and possibly months it took to produce and deliver this dreck and wreck of a snoring yawn fest had to have been somebody's cinematic baby, but why anybody would want to bring forth this deformed, micro cephalic vision of family disfunction and non-resolution is beyond me.

I rented this at my local Redbox, and it was purported to be a family film about a horse (and a family, i guess.) That's what the cover looks like, right? I'm thinking Black Stallion, Secretariat, Seabiscuit, Hidalgo, Flicka; you know something like that... Feh! (Can you hear my disgust? But I'm getting ahead of myself)  Hey, my daughter loves films about horses. What girl doesn't? But I always watch a film before my kids do, just so I know whether or not they should view it.

Let's put it this way... If you ever want to punish your kids, make them watch this film. However, it may help put them to sleep, but I doubt it. They'll probably just end up whining that they hate you, and you're abusing them, and twenty years later they'll need need therapy to recover from the crushingly boring torture it was to endure watching this movie.

Spoiler Alert!!!

If what I just said doesn't convince you to avoid this stumbling, hobbled, swaybacked, destined for the glue factory, and sorely in need of a bullet to the brain flick about a failing horse farm, then let me give you just a few lines more. Just so you understand what's in this film and why you should never watch it, I'm going to give ya'll a ""brief"" synopsis of the plot and story. Try to stay awake.

The film does not start out with horses. No, it starts out with two people dancing ballet, and not really well, I might add. That's because they are being taught by the film's main protagonist, a broken down dancer who gets a phone call from her brother to come back home because there's something wrong with their dad.

Welcome to Dark Horse Farm! Yea... Bleh.

Let's meet the fam, shall we?

There's Mom. She loves taking in stray, abused horses that nobody wants and trying to retrain them, so she can find good homes for them. Sort of like a horsey Humane Society. What an altruist, but apparently she and her daughter had a falling out years some ago about riding horses,  after she got in some kind of equestrian accident, and now the daughter refuses to ride at all. So she went off to become a dancer, then she got hurt dancing too, blah-blah-blah... It never was really explained what was their real beef with each other anyway.

There's Dad, who's going senile with Alzheimer's. He used to be an inventor with a bunch of patents, but now he's just seems to putter around in his workshop, promising everyone he's right on the verge of a great invention, but it's secret, so nobody look... more blah-blah-blah...

Back to their dance teaching daughter. She's bitter and resentful toward her mother for pushing her, back when she was a competitive riding hopeful, and then a horse threw her or something, and she got scared of horses, and decided to become a dancer, and her mommy didn't support her decision, then there was a rift between them that last years... Blah-blah-frickin'-blah...

Then there's her brothers. Oh Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, where to start? They hate each other, and have for years. See, back in the day, one of them had a girlfriend, and the other brother slept with her, and then stole her completely by marrying her, and the brothers haven't spoken for years, but now they are forced together on the farm because of their dad going senile, and other circumstances that make it impossible for anybody to leave the farm. The one (older?) brother now has 3 children. His oldest son and middle daughter, when they're not calling the adults stupid (and they are,) they fight like a cat and a dog, and their younger brother is autistic, but seems to get along with his slowly going bonkers grandpa.

The one brother's former girlfriend, now other brother's wife is still attracted to her former beau, and tells him she made a great mistake and he's an awesome man (even though it seems like he does absolutely nothing but drive poorly and wreck his VW van,) but after kissing him she says she never wants to be alone with him again... Say it with me now - Blah-Blah-Blah!!!

Oh, and there's the local horse whisperer dude who either was a bully to the daughter when they were young, or jilted her at prom, or something, but they have history, which is never really explained, or it was, but I didn't care, but dad hates this guy because he thinks he is having an affair with his wife, and gets all crazy when he sees the guy around or even thinks about him... I'm getting a headache...

Oh yeah, the main complication. They're going to lose the farm! See, dad took care of the finances, and dad's nuts (part of the time anyway) and let's all the bills get backed up to the point that when everybody convenes on the farm, they have 3 weeks before the bank seizes the property, and mom was so oblivious with her broken down horse obsession, that she ignored the plight of her farm that allowed her to have her horse obsession in the first place. In fact, she ignored that fact that her husband was just plain incompetent until it was absolutely too late! Way to go mom.

Oh heavens! What are we gonna' do?! How do we save the farm?! Well, dad says he has a great invention still in him, if he can just get it out before his mind completely drifts off into the ether. Daughter tries to get a land grant on short notice. Big brother with family wants to sell the farm (which is on a beautiful island) to developers and that should solve everything. Younger jilted brother has no ideas, and sits around playing with his brother's kids and chases his brother's wife, and occasionally when forced, runs into town with his hated brother to get supplies and parts for his father panacea of an invention.

Oh wait! This was a film about horses, right?!

Mom has found this great big purebred horse that is wild and abused, but if she can just get him tamed down and ridable, and win the big riding meet, and beat her old rival Patricia something or other, then they can sell the big Dark Horse, and save the farm! Yea! Everybody cheer!

See that's the Dark Horse the film is named after, oh, and the farm too... Whatever.

Anyway, more complications, more fighting between family members, more whining about long festering gripes, mom breaks her arm trying to ride the big Dark Horse, and finally even though she doesn't want to do it, the daughter decides to try and ride the big Dark Horse in the competition, because selling it will save the farm that she has not visited in years, but now does not want to lose. So the horse throws her a few times, and she wants to give up, but in the end perseveres, and rides him.

Way to go, daughter! 8P

Anyway, grampa and the autistic grandson go for a walk out on the island and get lost, and the fam all go searching for them, they find them in some cave by the water, (neither the boy or the grampa knows how they got there,) but then afterward they discover in grampa's secret workshop he is not really creating anything but a pile of mishmashed junk, which even includes drift wood found for him by his younger oh-so-helpful son (see the guy can do something.) So that solution to the farm's woes is out. The land grant falls through, but good news, they have a great offer for the farm from developers, but no one in the family but the older brother wants to sell.

So everything rest on winning the competition, and selling the titular Dark Horse!

Oh, there's a rekindled relationship between the daughter and the horse whisperer, or something... Oh I forget. Who cares?

Anyway, there are two parts to the big meet. The technical and the freestyle, and the daughter get thrown in the technical portion, and hurts her leg, but she's a trooper, and manages to win the freestyle, and then there's a lady interested in the horse, but she rides him, and he's just too much horse for her, and so no sell of the Dark Horse... Boo-hoo! Oh, and the horsemanship in this sequence is so dang exciting that you'd have to watch paint drying and grass growing, while at the same time contemplating the nothingness of being to get the same stupefying effect.

And you know what happens after all that? Do you wanna' know? Really? Do you care?

They lose the farm. Well, they sell it to the developers, but yeah, no more farm. The horses get sold or given away or something, maybe they just kept them all in their new backyard, I don't know. Then everybody packs up and leaves the island, but it's okay, because they still have their great big, incompetent, crazy, wrangling, bitter stupid family to lean on, and that's all that matters, that they love each other, (sort of) as they ride off in their trucks n' stuff to who knows where? Does the daughter get with the horse whisperer? Maybe. Meh. Maybe not.

What a great family movie. Don't you feel so glad you watched it? Yes. If you're a masochist.

Now, take all of that, and add in the heady ingredients of atrocious acting, horrid writing, and just plain stupid scenarios, and there you have your rotting horse apple of celluloid malaise. It was dedicated to somebody in the end, so I guess this might have been based or inspired on a true story or something, but why anybody would want to share or be inspired by this drivel beyond my poor reckoning. Hey, but to each their own.

The horse scenes were so banal, that I think I'd have had more fun going out to a local pasture and watching some ponies graze. You want a horse film for your kid? Go get Spirit. Never EVER put your children through this ""family"" movie.

The running time on this thing was 105 minutes, but it seem far, far, far longer. Almost like this review.

See what I mean.

Avoid. Seriously. Anathema to entertainment.

Don't say you haven't been warned.",1330992000,16,10476,4.488433228180862
4894748,1,B005UUSMP0,"We rented this because it looked like a decent family film, and my daughter loves movies about horses. There is very little about horses in this movie (despite the name). It is instead a painfully dull and badly acted film about a family of unlikeable people who spend the entire movie yelling at each other. Every once in awhile, the lead character would get on a horse and fall off - and that's about it.

4894750,1,B005UUSMP0,"The Dark Horse (Cornelia Moore, 2008)

I have seen three movies of this stripe on the past month, the inspiration-drama-featuring-a-big-horse-competition kinda deal--The Dark Horse, The Long Shot, and Dark Horse (a different film than this one, made sixteen years previous and directed by David Hemmings; this is not a remake). This one isn't the worst of the lot, but saying that is roughly akin to trying to find the least rotten apple in the bag. Not to put too fine a point on it, while this one sits right in the middle (The Long Shot was a smidge better, Dark Horse taps the bottom of the barrel while this can only see it through the muck), all three of them suck mightily, unless you are the kind of person who obsessively watches Hallmark Original Movies. Even my wife, who has been obsessed with Lifetime Original Movies as long as I've known her (she's seen Mother, May I Sleep with Danger? almost as many times as I've seen Begotten), thought all three were ridiculous--and, as she pointed out while we were watching the climactic horse show in Dark Horse, which is remarkably similar to the one here, she spent a great deal of time at these a-long-long-way-from-Devon two-bit show rings when her aunt rode dressage. She's been there way more recently than I (last time I was at one live was before my wife was born), so I bow to her more recent expertise.

Moore (who showed up in front of the camera next year in the very good ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction) serves up  the usual dysfunctional-family-drama stew. It revolves around Dana (The Whole Truth's Carol Roscoe), a ballet teacher in San Francisco who has done her best to distance herself from her family, but is wheedled into returning when she discovers that her father Fiach (The Book of Stars' Sean G. Griffin)'s incipient Alzheimer's has caused the farm's finances to slide into default, and her opportunistic older brother Martin (Butterfly Dreaming's Mark Dias) has seized this opportunity and is trying to sell the farm. In order to save it, Dana will have to overcome the fear of horses she developed after falling off one and injuring herself during a dressage competition, and of course she has to do it with an equally damaged horse, and only her younger brother Finn (Fried Green Tomatoes' Haynes Brooke) to help her out.

Of course, there's a great deal more stuffed in here, including a ridiculous romantic subplot you're not gonna believe, but that's the general gist of the main storyline. And you know what? I could give you the entire rest of the plot and not have to add a single spoiler alert, because if you've watched any two Hallmark Original Movies that feature dysfunctional families, you should be able to pinpoint, with all-too-depressing accuracy, exactly where this movie is going to go. Moore, who also wrote, doesn't bother to even attempt a zig anywhere a standard inspirational piece like this would zag. Even a failed attempt of that stripe would have been better than a completely, utterly predictable movie that will have vanished from your head within fifteen minutes of you finishing watching it. That, however, is what we got. Avoid like the plague. *",1379203200,,3165,4.801834862385321

I especially loved the ending, which I won't give away, but which was absolutely the right ending for the story.

As others have said, from the trailer and other marketing, you'd expect this to be a film about horses.  It's not - the horses are just there to give the characters something to argue about.  It's actually the story of a family with all sorts of issues (many of which are never clearly explained).

The film was written, directed and acted with just enough skill to avoid being an embarrassment for everyone involved. You almost wish it were worse, because then it might be enjoyable as one of those ""so-bad-it's-good"" movies.  The story is entirely cliche and forgettable.  The characters are so underdeveloped that it's difficult to figure out their relationships or to discern why everyone is so angry at each other.  That's OK, though, because by the end the strife, conflict and discord have magically vanished and everyone reconciles.  Nothing really happens to rebuild the frayed family bonds.  It's just that suddenly, situations that would have sparked arguments and hostility in the first two-thirds of the film somehow instead lead to hugs and harmony.  This resolution feels hollow, unearned, and completely unsatisfying.

For long stretches, the characters communicate mainly through meaningful looks and two-sentence conversations that leave a lot unexplained.  On the one hand, you find yourself wishing they woud say more so the film might be less boring and incomprehensible.  On the other hand, what dialog there is is so awkward and unrealistic that less is probably better.

[spoiler alert] I was pleasantly surprised that the family doesn't end up saving their farm.  I give the filmmakers kudos for having the guts to forego the pat, happy ending.  However, the good will they earned for that is canceled out by their excruciatingly bad portrayal of an autistic child.

8487118,5,B005UUSMP0,"I liked Carol Roscoe in The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, so I decided to pop this on my watchlist for a rainy day. I am absolutely satisfied that I did.

The Dark Horse is not a ""horse movie."" If you want to watch some formula slop about a ""troubled"" teenage girl and a ""troubled"" horse ""saving"" each other, you're gonna be disappointed. If you want a Lifetime movie about a single mother returning to Dressage for the sake of her children, this also is not the movie for you. But, if you like character pieces, and you're open to listen to what isn't being said, boy have you come to the right place my friend.

Shot in and around Orcas Island of Washington State, The Dark Horse unfolds like a love letter to the land itself. You the viewer will be slowly waltzed through a story that doesn't insult your intelligence with endless backstory but concentrates instead on giving you an over-the-shoulder view of a family facing a time of crisis and change.

Yes, the pacing is slower than a big budget Hollywood production. This is not, in my opinion, a fault. The viewer is allowed to come to know each character as they move through their own personal conflicts as well as the unifying crisis at large.

Carol Roscoe and Kathryn Mesney-Hetler shine as strong women without the usual ""Look at me! I'm a FIERCE INDEPENDENT WOMAN who don't need no man!"" shtick, which I found exceedingly refreshing.

Director Cornelia Durye Moore has managed to tell a powerful story about the human condition without artifice, a skill Big Hollywood and Big Indie often fail to replicate.

Do not turn your nose up at this gem. Just trust me.",1529107200,,1620,4.607638888888889
8487119,1,B005UUSMP0,"Kind of a funny thing... naming a movie ""The Dark Horse"", then having only about 5 total minutes of horses in the entire movie. This is not a horse movie. If you came here for a horse movie, you will not get one!

 Just listen to the other reviews, they were right; this movie is somewhat terrible. Poor acting, strange but somehow predictable and cliche plot, and a lot of just ""what the heck are ya'll doing??!"" moments throughout. If you insist on watching this movie, try to ignore all of the misinformation being displayed regarding the horse. It seemed like every actor or actress that handled the horse had..... perhaps never seen one in their entire life? Perhaps this was the first time they had even pet a horse, because they seemed to be very uncomfortable/did not know what in the actual heck they were doing with that massive animal.

 The dressage scene towards the end was excruciating to watch. The poor girl was doing it all wrong, her technique was somewhat horrid, the horse did not have that great of headset, and somehow, despite using no real dressage moves whatsoever, she appears to have won first place. I happen to know a great deal about horses and dressage, so the misinformation throughout the scenes with the horses drove me crazy. If you aren't really a horse person, you probably will not notice. Disregard my rant and attempt to sit through this snoozefest of a movie.",1521849600,,1401,4.659919028340081

8487121,5,B005UUSMP0,"I really enjoyed this film.
As a professional rider whom nows has a severe chronic illness, I know what it's like to have to change. To adapt. To accept. To hold onto what you can.
This story really struck a chord with me. And who doesn't like to watch a fresian move?  Dressage and Western dressage are still my specialties ( I still give clinics and judge), so a I thoroughly enjoyed the learning of the dressage test, the progession made, and the lovely relaxed test at the end.
Thank you for a beautiful story about real life. Real struggle. Real beauty. Real heartache. And how to over come.",1515369600,2,596,4.467889908256881
8487122,4,B005UUSMP0,"Ok, it isn't a horse movie, though there are some pretty horses.  It is, as other reviews mentioned, a coming home story.  The family is dysfunctional but not in the obvious ways.  There are no beatings and no drinking or drugs involved.  Generally, each character has made decisions in difficult circumstances that caused rifts to grow between the family members.  In the course of the movie, more difficult circumstances arise.

To portray this movie as a simple 'Save the farm' saga is to miss the point.  This is a movie about wounded relationships, and the characters do grow and change.  As an example, when the main character returns to the farm from the city, her mother gives her a light, almost brisk embrace, more symbol than hug.  Later in the movie, the mother hugs two of the horses she has adopted, tightly and warmly.  It is not, apparently, that she doesn't like hugging, but that there is a distance in the relationship with her daughter.

I could relate far more with these characters than with those in some more violent dramas.  I like that the problems were not born of addiction or abuse.  I believe I learned something about my own life and reactions by viewing this movie.

There was also wonderful music and beautiful landscapes, as well as the occasional horses with or without riders.  Eye candy for those of us who appreciate rugged old trees and driftwood-strewn coastline, verdant fields and well groomed horses.",1446940800,,1443,4.808943089430894
