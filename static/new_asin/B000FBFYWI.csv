2559572,5,B000FBFYWI,"I was 12-14 living in Sacramento when these three world series were going on.  The Oakland A's just came out of nowhere to shock the world and I was there and loving it.  Very nice to see those wild crazy swinging A's again.  I very much enjoyed watching these highlights and if you are a A's fan you will have to have this.  Reggie, Campy, Geno, Catfish, Blue Moon, Rudi, Rollie, Sal the captain.  Some of the most memorable characters in baseball history and they were one of my favorite teams (the Giants being the other) of all time.  Not a steroid in sight just a bunch of good ball players clicking together (and fighting each other) and having fun.  Oh and Charlie O the mule, can't forget him.

Just get this and enjoy.",1267747200,2,727,4.373134328358209
2559573,5,B000FBFYWI,Any SF Bay Area native should buy this DVD! All Baseball fans and History buffs should also buy this DVD!!,1240531200,,106,4.35
2559574,2,B000FBFYWI,Very disappointed.  i wanted and expected the full 1973 World Series.  Not impressed that it's just highlights.,1220832000,4,111,5.470588235294118
2559575,4,B000FBFYWI,"A&E did a nice job with this DVD. The extra attention given to the 89 series during the quake copies most of the 1989 World Series VHS version.  Anyone who rooted for the A's in the last 40 years would enjoy this colllection. The fact that the SF Giants were unable to win any titles during their 50 years in the Bay Area makes it that more special. However my view of this collection does include the fact that I myself can be seen on it. During the 1989 portion, I am standing behind the ""Welcome Back Ricky"" banner clapping my hands. this is the same video from the 1989 World Series Vhs version. I am wesring black sunglasses and have my hat turned around backwards.",1207267200,2,670,4.317460317460317
2559576,5,B000FBFYWI,This was an excellent video. I've been a fan of the A's since they arrived from Kansas City. It was great watching all the legendary player together again. It didn't get any better than that.,1168300800,,191,4.485714285714286
2559577,2,B000FBFYWI,"If you've seen previous World Series VHS tapes, then you're not missing anything if you pass up these DVD's because they are merely those tapes put onto DVD. It sure would have been nice if they had ""cleaned up"" footage somehow because I see the same rough spots, flicks, and ticks, etc. that I saw in the VHS tapes when they first came out.  Some new or different footage would've been a treat to those of us who have seen the VHS tapes before. Each World Series shows far too much fan reaction and crowd shots and the sort while not concentrating on the action afield enough - this must be MLB's way of showing they care about fans (rolling eyes); the 1989 Series film was the worst by far. So if you already have the VHS tapes of your team's World Series appearances, DO NOT get these.",1157500800,5,788,4.324324324324325
2559578,5,B000FBFYWI,"This DVD is great for any A's fan or just baseball fans in general. This DVD has 4 seperate films you can choose from on the main screen that document that year's world series. These were also made in the year that the series was played. I enjoyed seeing the footage of A's greats like Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson, Vida Blue, Terry Steinbach, Mark McGwire, Dave Stewart and Jose Canseco,",1154995200,9,390,4.585714285714285
2559579,4,B000FBFYWI,My 13yr old son who is a hugh A's fan loved this video. Then going to Fanfest 2014 and listening to the players from those series speak about it made him feel like he was there.  Great memories. Yes original film (vintage)and now i see why.,1392422400,,240,4.217391304347826
2559580,5,B000FBFYWI,I must admit I did not watch this DVD. I bought it as a birthday gift for my brother. He really enjoyed it and came back to me with all kinds of knowledge of the team that I didn't know. He really enjoyed it and I know another Athletics fan would also love it.,1388620800,,260,3.8333333333333335
2559581,3,B000FBFYWI,"As others have commented, no enhancements were done to these early 1970s and 1989  World Series videos.  They were just transferred over to DVD as is, which means the resolution, picture quality etc. are nowhere near what we expect in today's Blu-Ray world.  That said, it's great fun to see these old films and remember both the A's and their opponents.  Those opponents were the ""Big Red Machine"" Cincinnati Reds, the New York Mets, the Los Angele Dodgers, and the San Francisco Giants.  This was during the Charlie Finley era, so the bright green and blinding yellow A's uniforms are worth a look all by themselves!  And then there are the players - Joe Rudy, Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando, Vida Blue, Rollie Fingers, Catfish Hunter, and many more for the A's ... and equally great players for the opposition!  So if you accept it for what it is - unmodified old video highlights - you will enjoy it.",1375747200,,899,4.651898734177215
2559582,5,B000FBFYWI,"Really enjoyed the 70""s footage & coverage. Just loved seeing those old ball players again, brought me back to when I was a kid!!!",1362355200,,130,4.458333333333333

2559584,5,B000FBFYWI,This is the absolute perfect gift for the A's fan that has everything!  I can never think of anything else to get for my dad and he LOVED this!,1357171200,,143,3.9310344827586206
2559585,2,B000FBFYWI,My problem with buying this dvd is the advertising. I thought that kind of thing was not put on a purchased item like dvds/,1355875200,3,123,4.166666666666667
2559586,5,B000FBFYWI,My husband got this video for Christmas and has seen it several times since then. It is entertaining and well done,1325980800,,114,4.476190476190476
2559587,5,B000FBFYWI,"In the 70's, when I was in high school, the A's were my favorite baseball team. Back then you could order highlight reels but they came in black and white and you had to have a projector to watch them. I literally stumbled across this dvd while browsing around Amazon and had to have it. I now have realized just how wide a variety Amazon offers....I have found stuff at a way better price than say Wal Mart. Thanks Amazon.",1322438400,,423,4.3

8120263,5,B000FBFYWI,"I'm a diehard Phillies' fan, but for reasons unknown, I've also always liked the A's.  I haven't viewed this DVD yet, but will shortly after I finish this review.  I will enjoy revisiting some of their championship years.",1459900800,,221,4.7894736842105265
