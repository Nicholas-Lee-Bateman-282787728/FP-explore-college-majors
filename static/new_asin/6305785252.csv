1075467,5,6305785252,"When you mess with the dead,be prepared to pay the consequences! Ben Stiles loves to SCARE people. But he's about to get the fright of his life when the mysterious wailing ghost of Wickwire House beckons Ben and his  friend Katherine(Elisha Cuthbert) into the eerie world of the supernatural  Who is she?What does she want? Will he become the  prime character in a  real-life ghost story? As he puts his life-and his sanity-on the line to  uncover the shocking truth behind the haunting, he finds himself in over  his head. A hair raising thriller that will leave you breathless. A good  spooky movie. Great special effects. Not cheesy. Elisha Cuthbert from  Popular Mechanics for Kids played a great part. I enjoy her movies, a  little hard to get in the United States. A movie you can watch over and  over. Not for young children may give them bad nightmares about ghosts.  Great Halloween movie. Buy this movie, you will not  regret it.",958521600,10,939,4.728395061728395

1075629,5,6305785252,"An absolutely beautiful movie. Wonderful cinematography, gorgeous colors/lighting. The Director (Robert Tinell) led the young actors strongly. All the actors are great (Ben Gazarra, Andrea Martin in a brief role & especially Christopher Heyerdahl as Ben's grandfather). But the young actors are superb. Ben (Ricky Mabe) is an innocent but highly intelligent prankster who is kicked out of his private schools for scaring kids with fake ghosts. But he meets a real ghost when he goes to live with his grandfather. He helps local girl Katherine (Elisha Cuthbert) get mean guys off her back with his bag of electronic tricks. The real ghost continues to visit them & they do research to try to find out who she is, how to help her. There is No gore (I am so sick of gore so this is a big plus for me). But an elegant ghost story. A good ending (love good endings). No animals are killed (a trend today & so this is also a plus). Just perfect!",1472256000,2,939,4.595238095238095

Elisha Cuthbert's performance is not terrible and it is easy to see why she got work after. The young male lead makes the movie hard to watch as he comes off a little ""Leave it to Beaver"", but this could also be due to the writing (no one speaks that way especially kids). As you can see by the rating the movie is rated PG so don't expect buckets of corn syrup and dye, but expect a long episode of ""Goosebumps"".",1420416000,,576,4.198198198198198

1076261,4,6305785252,"Believe was much more a film about family realationships, giving, understanding and open communication than it was about the ghost that appeared in this film. It was entertaining, held my interest, and gave me no doubts that it was appropriate for the pre-teen in the room with me. As a matter of fact, I would recommend this for family viewing because it would open the discussions about family love and communication. Was the ghost really a ghost, or was the author using her as a symbol of what happens when old grudges are held for way too long?

Very good acting, considering a very mild script, and it was a delight to see Andrea Martin again. Recommended!",1413244800,,662,4.6581196581196584
1076262,5,6305785252,"I purchased this movie when it was just a few years old, my daughter was just about 7 and it was her favorite movie until she was about 10...that's longevity for a little one!  I didn't know any of the young actors in it at the time I got it because it looked really scary and I love horror but this is not horror and not too scary even for little ones. I actually would have been disappointed if not for how much my girl loved it and how entertaining it turned out to be.  Time goes by and the VHS tape was eventually give away or sold in a yard sale and forgotten until just last night when I casually said we should watch a scary movie together while my husband was at work and my now 16 year old teen daughter surprised me by saying, ""You know, remember that movie about..."", ""what was it called?  Believe?""  Imagine our delight to find it easily here on Amazon, especially since we are Prime subscribers so we got to watch it free!  It was so much fun to snuggle in with my usually aloof adolescent lying on me on the couch chomping on popcorn with her all important cell phone and laptop abandoned for the time-being in her room.  The great thing was it ended up being just as enjoyable to watch as it had been so long ago and it was amusing to see Elisha Cuthbert in such an innocent role.  I believe this is a perfect movie for the entire family.  It's made well, written well, and has a range of actors from several generations for many to recognize and enjoy.

1076266,5,6305785252,It was a fun movie. It would be totally appropriate for 12 and up. It was a good non horrifying ghost story .,1401408000,,109,3.782608695652174
1076267,4,6305785252,"First off, the cover art on the DVD is rather misleading. If you're a hard-core horror fan, this probably won't be to your taste -- it's not a supernatural nightmare like ""The Ring"", or even a harrowing psychological thriller like ""The Turn of the Screw"".

But the good news is -- it's a perfectly enjoyable film if you're looking for the suspense equivalent of the ""cozy"" type of crime novel. An earlier reviewer noted that this film may not be suitable for very young kids (under age 5) but for older children, especially tweens who aren't into graphic horror but are comfortable with playing make-believe, it may be just right. It's actually two different movies -- one is a fairly conventional tale of a ghost associated with a decades-old family secret, which as others have pointed out is a familiar pattern from Saturday-morning kids' shows. The second is about a friendship that develops between two very lonely children, which happens to take place in a Gothic type of setting.

For me, the relationship story is a lot more compelling than the supernatural events, which seem a bit strained especially in the second half of the film. We learn that teenaged Katherine is grieving the recent loss of her parents, and being targeted by the town bullies to boot. She gradually opens up to Ben, who's been sent to live with his grandfather as a punishment for being expelled from boarding school. Ben may seem mild-mannered and nerdy, but he has a passion for playing elaborate practical jokes. Watching the traumatized Katherine gradually come back to life, as Ben reaches out and includes her in the preparations for a prank on her tormentors, is one of the most entertaining scenes in the film.

The young leads, Elisha Cuthbert and Ricky Mabe, have since established solid careers in TV and film. Their fans may like to see this example of their early work -- both of them are onscreen for most of this movie, and even at that age were able to hold up their end in scenes with veteran actors like Jan Rubes (Ben's skeptical grandfather) and Andrea Martin (a paranormal researcher who provides some mentoring for the teens). ""Believe"" does have some entertaining moments, provided you aren't expecting something as edgy and troubling as Daniel Radcliffe's ""The Woman in Black"". It's a low-budget Canadian children's movie but I thought the filmmakers put in a good effort. It was shot around Montreal although the story takes place in New England -- I was interested to read Mark D. Clark's information about the film's budget and the production design. As of about 2010, Ricky's been working more behind the camera, hoping to direct feature films himself, so this makes the ""house haunting"" scene from ""Believe"" that much more fun to watch.",1355875200,,2748,4.855010660980811
1076268,5,6305785252,I saw this movie on Netflix and was so happy to find it on here.

1076377,4,6305785252,"Believe is the story of a young boy who likes to play tricks on others and is suddenly faced with a serious situation involving a ghost who needs help. The story is handled in a child friendly, Disneyesque fashion that would make it suitable for most children. It is sort of on the level of a ride through the ""Haunted Mansion"" attraction at Disney theme parks.

The young hero, Ben Stiles, played by Ricky Mabe, is a sympathetic character who lets his boyish enthusiasm for pranks get him into trouble and kicked out of school. The story picks up in a small town in Maine where Ben's estranged grandfather lives alone in a big house which turns out to be haunted. It is up to Ben and a young girl he meets there, Katherine Winslowe, played by Elisha Cuthbert to solve the mystery of the ghostly presence.

This movie is a pleasant diversion and provides an enjoyable evening's entertainment; I recommend it highly.",1338768000,11,915,4.607361963190184
1076378,4,6305785252,"""Believe"" is the perfect family-friendly Halloween watch. It has clean language, credible acting, and enough atmosphere and suspense to keep viewers (primarily tweens) engaged. The story centers on teenager Benjamin Stiles (Ricky Mabe) who keeps getting kicked out of each private school his parents enroll him in. His parents are absentee parents, traveling the world while Ben is stuck in boarding schools, feeling unwanted and lonely. When Ben is kicked out of his current school, his parents decide to send him to live with his grandfather, Jason Stiles (Jan Rubes), a man Ben has not seen since he was five years old, and who is estranged from Ben's dad.

When Ben gets to the large Stiles estate, he finds his grandfather polite but aloof, and soon begins to see a strange woman appearing around the estate, dressed in a red coat. Ben's queries are met with disapproval and silence on the part of his grandfather, and everyone seems to behave as though nothing is amiss. It is only after Ben meets another teen, Katharine (Elisha Cuthbert) that he realizes he has not been imagining things. Katharine Winslowe also sees the ghost, and the pair try to solve the mystery of the haunting, discovering long-hidden family secrets and a tragedy that has resulted in the estrangement between two families.

I thought the story was generally well-paced (except for one story arc about getting even with the town bullies that seemed very childish to me). Other than that, the story itself is interesting, and as I mentioned, this is a movie suited more for the tween set, and can also be enjoyed as a family.",1288224000,7,1605,4.875457875457876

1076380,1,6305785252,"Just taking a moment to say that of the thousands of movies I've watched in my day this holds the title for the worst ever.  I'd give it less than a one star rating but such is not possible.  Jeez-o-whiz, this is such a piece of doo doo.  It's a horror movie with no fright factor at all, the leads' acting is so atrocious that he has less range than a putt-putt course and his primary facial expression comprises of a furrowed brow and the eternal look of confusion.  These annoyances are just a tip of the hefty iceberg that make this movie straight garbage.

The only power this flick seems to possess is the uncanny ability to protract time, making an hour and a half seem like a solid, bang-your-head-against-the-wall three hours.

I guess that's what I get when I rent a horror movie that isn't rated R There was was nothing scary about this film at all. It mainly focused on some punk kid and his stupid pranks. They don't get to solve the mystery behind the ghost until the last 30 minutes of the film. What I also didn't like about this movie was the kid had so much knowledge and equipment for creating pranks to scare people, that it seemed impossible. I'd like to say that there were some scenes of the movie where it was intresting, but there weren't any! I found the whole movie very boring. I was so bored that I decided to surf the web while it was still playing .I wouldn't even watch this crap if it were on television. We don't really get to see much of the real ghost. She just appears every now and then and stairs at a few people. The acting was so dumb and there were no actual effects at all. The story behind the ghost was SO stupid. I expected a lot more to it at the end, but nope. The grandfather acted like an ass and the kid was just a wuss. Overall this is one of those movies with a cool cover, but a stupid plot. Sorry to keep this review short, but I think I've already gotten my point across. Don't rent, buy, or even look at the cover of this BIG PIECE OF CRAP! Enough said!",1142294400,5,1359,4.033333333333333
1076383,4,6305785252,"Found this to be a good old fashioned ghost story.  Recommend it to anyone who loves a good ghost story and with a bit of a romantic twist.

No blood or violence which makes it a nice change to watch.

The acting might not be up to scratch, but if you want to sit back, chill out and watch a 'ghost' story movie, watch this one.",1140048000,2,328,3.9393939393939394

besides i'll bet the world anything that how you found that movie in the scary section was because it was sitting on the shelf beside a movie about your thoughts,mr.scary cherie and besides i want to see you sitting in the dark watching the exorcist all alone and a pair of scissors beside you.well wait thats not scary.besides i wonder if you were born on halloween at 12:00 i know i was .well believe was a great movie it didn't have to be scary to be good besides jonnny if a movie has some type of ghost in it it's going to be in the horror section even if the ghost could be a person uder a blanket saying

1076385,2,6305785252,"I would not say this is a bad movie, but it definitely is a movie for little kids.  If you have wee ones that you want to scare and entertain then by all means buy this, but if you want a scary movie for adults, stay away by any means possible.  I was utterly bored and unimpressed with this childish ghost story.  If you want something to scare an adult with above average intelligence then try ""The Changeling"" or ""Stir of Echoes"".  You'll be much happier.",992390400,7,458,4.290697674418604
1076386,4,6305785252,"It's never easy being 14 years old, but it's especially tough for Ben Stiles. First, he can't seem to communicate with his absentee parents, diplomats who apparently live overseas. Then he gets kicked out of boarding  school after pulling an imaginative but childish ghost prank on his  classmates. He's forced to move in with an icy-tempered grandfather he  barely knows. And finally he discovers his grandfather's estate is haunted  by the eerie specter of a young woman in a red coat. Of course after the  ghost prank, no one takes his claims seriously.
Ben (Ricky Mabe) is the  point-of-view character of BELIEVE, a new horror film aimed at younger  audiences and lensed by director Robert Tinnell, whose previous work  includes horror fan favorite FRANKENSTEIN AND ME. Unlike FRANKENSTEIN AND  ME, which was essentially a coming-of-age story with horror trappings,  BELIEVE is designed to generate real chills - and it delivers. Even veteran  horror fans should receive at least a few satisfying shivers from the  picture.
As BELIEVE's story progresses, Ben quickly realizes his  grandfather (Jan Rubes) isn't telling everything he knows about the  mysterious figure in the red coat. Granddad goes ape when he discovers that  Ben has enlisted the help of a neighbor girl (Elisha Cuthbert), who has  also seen the ghost, in his quest for the truth. The girl's uncle (Ben  Gazzara ) is equally upset by this development, and forbids her from seeing  Ben. The teenagers realize that somehow their families' histories will  unlock the secrets of the Stiles house, and maybe help their phantom  finally find peace.
Imagine George Romero shooting a movie for The  Wonderful World of Disney and you have some idea of the film's tone. To  achieve this effect, Tinnell asked production designer Jules Ricard to  decorate his sets in the style of the classic Hammer horrors. Then Tinnell  shot his movie much in the mode of Mario Bava. Viewers who know Tinnell  only through FRANKENSTEIN AND ME will find BELIEVE a revelation. It's far  more visually cohesive than his early work and its use of color is  striking. Certainly Tinnell was well served by cinematographer Pierre  Jodoin, whose work is imaginative and eloquent. Composer Jerry DeVilliers  Jr. sets the mood with a truly haunting score.
Tinnell, a formidable  horror film scholar in addition to a gifted young filmmaker, built in  several nods toward great ghost pictures of the past. Horror aficionados  will appreciate the film's visual references to movies like THE UNINVITED  and THE INNOCENTS. BELIEVE also quotes from THE HORROR OF DRACULA and (of  all things) THE INVISIBLE GHOST. The director confesses to influences as  wide-ranging as Romero's MARTIN and THE GHOST AND MR. CHICKEN, but his  capsule description of BELIEVE is ""the Hardy Boys meet Wuthering Heights.""
Tinnell had to bring in the picture on a $2 million budget and a 20-day  shooting schedule. To his credit, BELIEVE looks like a much more expensive  film. For what it's worth: BELIEVE has received glowing reviews from a  number of horror publications, from stately MIDNIGHT MARQUEE to  splatter-happy FANGORIA.",960940800,28,3142,5.120315581854044

7895060,5,6305785252,"This is a PG-rated movie, so it is not really a ""horror"" film by any stretch of the imagination. In fact you can tell within minutes of beginning the movie that middle school kids are the intended audience. I would describe it as a ""mystery ghost story"" because it is about a benign haunting that two young teens-- a boy and a girl-- set out to investigate with an eye toward finding out who the ghost is that is haunting their families and why she seems to be reaching out to them for help. Without introducing any spoilers here, I will only say that this is a lovely tale with a touch of innocent teen romance and a beautiful ending that the whole family is sure to enjoy.",1488931200,,674,4.2734375
