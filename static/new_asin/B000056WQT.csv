I thought the story was awesome and had some deep themes to it, like Holly's search for her father, whom she hadn't seen since she was a small child and Tiger's search for his brother Gray Wolf.",1126569600,,395,4.12987012987013

The colors and animation easily beat the others, as do the stories  and the characters.  Buy this crazy video!",962841600,2,263,4.777777777777778
