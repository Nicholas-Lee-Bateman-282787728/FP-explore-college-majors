I sat down with an open mind, I mean I have seen some bad pornos,B movies,home videos but this one stunned me. As the movie progressed it kept getting worse and worse and just when I thought it couldn't possibly get any worse I was proven wrong. First of all the story line was totally confusing, the acting was bad....really bad, editing was bad, I even heard the director say ""cut"" in two scenes. After the movie all I kept thinking was how could this bad of a movie get produced. Please don't waste your time and money as I did and avoid this movie from the school of movie making hell.",1113609600,6,752,4.378571428571429

2055103,4,B0002235KI,"Yup! remember when the young boy drops a ring before the girl he likes and then has to see her and her family killed, it did cause a lot of trauma.

Twenty years later - [unknown to me at the time] When John Slaughter shows up with his guns and meets up with Moses Logan [Fahey]we are introduced to a man with a mission.  And funny it is.

He has apparently been friends with the oriental family that Jack Pickett is determined to run off.  Jack Pickett has reformed?

When the lady gunslinger, Savanah Starr shows up she gives Pickett a great put-down.  Did get a kick out of her coming out of her bath with guns blazing.  [:-) Did she need a towel?  Mattie Baker asks. Great scene! [She turns out to be the prettyist blonde I have seen.]

Now the little bordello gal that John takes to bed? very pretty boobs. [totaly unnecessary to the movie]

Did you get the drift that Savanah Starr was an apparition - mighty handy in a shoot-out though.  She was allowed to come back to avenge her family's murder.  She has lived for 20 years in John's memory - he has felt empty without her.

She gives him back his feelings for life and fades from his memory.  What a heart stopper!

2055104,2,B0002235KI,"This movie is a combination of a western, a kung fu flick and a mixed up melodrama that takes place during the lifetime of some young kids who watch a town get wiped out. One kid watches two of his friends get shot down, but grows up to find out that the girl is indeed alive and well and also seeking vengeance against the ne'er do wells who shot up their loved ones. Jeff Fahey gets top billing in this movie, but that was the same kind of scam that the movie ""The Faculty"" ran on Usher Raymond; use the name, get the crowd's attention so that the crowd can find out, much too late, that the person only appears for a few minutes. Fahey appears on screen for all of three minutes, all told. The remainder of the cast appears as confused about what's going on as the viewer. People are getting shot, hand-to hand combat degenerates into name-calling -- here's what I think happened. The guy who wrote it had a of ideas and only a little bit of money. So he sold the rights to somebody who had some ideas and very little money. The product is 'ghost rock.' And now, the final point which should prove how goony this flick is, and I can tell you in two words: Gary Busey. This man has issues. He hasn't been the same since he appeared in ""Predator 2."" In this movie he's the super cocky town power baron who wants everybody to know he's running things. But in one scene when he's in the bar, having just gunned down the bartender, and shouts ""who's town is this?"" not one person responds! And from there, it only gets worse. Do yourself a favor: let ""Ghost Rock"" remain on the shelves of the video store.",1093651200,2,1603,4.259016393442623
2055105,5,B0002235KI,"I liked this movie a lot. I'm definitely going to buy it in the future. I guess I don't know the difference between good acting and bad acting, because I watch a lot of movies that I think the acting was just fine, yet others seem to find the acting bad.  I liked the story, the action, the fighting, the scenery, etc.  I say it is a great movie, but I'm in no position to recommend movies I like to others, because most people are too picky and have high standards.  I loved this movie because it entertained me. If you like independent movies, then you should like this, I think.",1092355200,2,581,4.216216216216216
2055106,3,B0002235KI,"Based on the reviews I've read about this film here on amazon and on other sites(imdb,etc.) I knew I'd either love or hate the film.  If you're a fan of westerns or martial art movies then you'll appreciate how Ghost Rock tips it's hat to many of the old and new classics.  But beware.  This is a B-movie with C-list actors.  If you can only watch A-list movies then stay away.  Cheers!  To Lions Gate for giving a fairly average movie a chance to find it's audience.",1087776000,,467,4.310344827586207
2055107,1,B0002235KI,"Oh my. I don't know where to start. What good things can I say about this movie? Other then it was in focus, not very much. There were so many ""jump cuts"" (dialog, clothing and items that are out of time in a peirod movie)I was sure this western was supost to be set in the 1880's. Now I'm not a history expert, but I'm kinda sure they didn't have plasic poker chips in the 1880's. There are too many others to mention
The plot was weaker then watered down drink in a cheap bar. The acting was...bad, very bad. This was not even a B movie. The only good thing I can say was it had some ok kung fu...but what white guys knew kung fu in the 1880's? Maybe this was just a tax right off for some studio head. Who ever green lighted this should be sent back to the mail room, or worst, producing day time soaps.",1086566400,3,806,4.012422360248447
2055108,1,B0002235KI,"While it is obvious that the majority of American society condones iniquity and pornography in its various stages (i.e. minor to major), I am not part of that majority.

2055111,4,B0002235KI,"A good sagebrush western, the bad guys are really bad,
the good guys are just regular guys trying to make things right.
Has a hint of paranormal aspect to it.
Gary Busey, Jeff Fahey are both great in their characters.

2055113,1,B0002235KI,"A number of familiar, good actors with a horrible script.
Good Points : Jeff Fahey steals the scenes he's in, cause it's the best acting in the movie (without trying hard, it seems).
Bad Points :  Busey is not at his best.  The scene w Savannah Starr (Lano)*towel*, no frontal (disappointed).  The oriental actors parts come right out of a ""D"" Western (not low grade ""B"" but ""D""isappointing D-Grade...
Full of cliche's and not really worth buying, or renting really, IMHO.
In all, should be considered a bad comedy rather than bad Western!",1206403200,,539,4.774193548387097
2055114,4,B0002235KI,"I have never liked the idea of karate in a cowboy movie, but this one did it just fine. The story was good. As usual, Garey Busey portrayed the antagonist as well as anyone can. Being a huge fan of Michael Worth, the karate was great, as ususal, but I do not think I have ever see him do a better job of acting. Busey and aoo of his antagonists almost dominated the movie as much as Worth's character. The reconcilliaton of the brothers at the end was great, and unexpected. This movie had a little touch of comedy which offset all the killing. I really enjoyed this movie. Andrianne Barbeau is as beautiful as ever. Would have liked to seen her ""one knock out punch"" more often.

This movie combined karate and cowboy just great, but I never want to see Clint Eastwood turning fifty flips in the air , screaming at the top of his lung , just to throw a karate chop to the head that gets blocked by a 357 Magnum. Great movie. Would love to see something of a sequel.",1203120000,,966,4.221621621621622
2055115,4,B0002235KI,"This movie, judged alongside all the movies in movie history, is terrible. The directing is nonexistant, the acting is wooden and hard to watch, and scenes lack any sort of cohesive flow. Also, the writing is beyond bad. Also, the movie has several onscreen mistakes e.g. A flag with 50 stars in a western, an A/C unit, guns with no recoil.

However, this movie is so bad, it is funny to watch. Roll with laughter as you try and follow the unbelievable ""story."" Slap your knee when you see the karate-infused fights. Belly-laught when Busey shoots a bartender and then screams, ""FEELS GOOD TO KILL!"" Just watching Busey smile is a credit to the film. So, I would recommend this movie, because for $3.45, you won't find a better ""comedy.""",1151280000,,737,4.6692307692307695
2055116,5,B0002235KI,"I have watched this movie many times and i have the dvd, and its pretty good. I got it because I go to Tucson every summer on vacation from Florida and always go to the Old Tucson film Studios.
I know it was kinda filmed on the cheap, but I enjoy it pretty much, plus last year I took my girlfriend , now everytime we have company over , we watch it and she tells them she had a drink from that same bar.
When they finished the movie, they didn't seem to go over and check the finished product. During the fight scene at the end, you can see flourescent lighting on the roofs of some of the buildings and a air conditioning condensing unit on a building rooftop.
But other than that, its not a bad movie...",1149897600,,706,4.086330935251799

Language: English
Subtitles: English, Spanish
Dubbed: French, Spanish
Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1

What I got:
A 4:3 copy with the top cut down to make it look widescreen. So, yeah, with the cutting it is technically a 1.85:1 widescreen.
No subtitles (English or Spanish).
No dubbing (French or Spanish).

8020220,5,B0002235KI,"High Noon, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Outlaw Josey Wales, True Grit are just a few titles to go down in the annals of classic Western history. All very fine features but now seem overrated after witnessing the film they call Ghost Rock. Sure John Wayne and Clint Eastwood provided silver screen magic, but Gary Busey provided us with direct to video gold this evening. When looking for a suitable Friday night B we came across several options until we saw some cover art sporting a screaming Busey face and knew we found a winner. For classic Western enthusiasts Ghost Rock will leave shaking your head within the first 5 minutes, most likely to be shut off by the 10 minute mark. For the B lovers out there this will be a new favored classic that you'll speak about for years. Awful acting...check...B rate cast...check...confusing plot that leads nowhere...check. If this past paragraph hasn't sold you then please save yourself some time and read no further.

We opens up Ghost Rock with some kids playing hide and seek as a exceptionally cheap power point credit presentation rolls out. One of the kids sees a band of outlaws besiege his town and kill all his family. From there we flash forward to the same outlaw group as the are still reeking the same havoc on yet another sleepy desert town. Run by Danny Glover's brother, Randy Glover, this crew is about as believable as Richard Simmons playing starting quarterback for the Green Bay Packers. Our favorite was the juiced up apache look a-like who was affectionately referred to as the Barber as he brandished two razor blades to attack with. Naturally the kid from the beginning is all grown up and on a mission of revenge as he stalks the outlaws. When he does cross their path an insanely lame shoot out takes place and a whole lot of martial arts. Didn't realize the Wild West was so well versed in Asian warfare. As confusing as this was we found it a delightful touch. Our hero somehow survives his tussle with the outlaws and makes his way back to his old tow where the new town Mayor is non-other than Gary Busey. Busey, whom looked like a bloated wax figure of himself, puts on a mind-bending performance and carries the movie on his back. Turns out that back in town our hero is actually very close with Jeff Wong and his family who must have immigrated to the Wild West at some point and taught him all the martial arts moves. Still confusing, but did provide a little clarity. From here the story gets so convoluted as an attractive blonde gun slinger rolls into town and joins forces with the hero. Turns out this women is his sister whom he thought had died years ago. They reunited to take out the outlaws and Mayor Busey and move on out of town to greener pastures.

When the credits rolled we still weren't quite sure what we watched but we just know that it was supremely entertaining. Without Busey the film would have suffered even further then it did to the likes that even Jeff Wong would have had no chance to save the show. One addition that would have been great was to see a stout Wilfred Brimley stroll on set in his exact get up from Crossfire Trail. After seeing that visual we felt he would have fit into this cast so perfectly. Actually Brimley should have been mandatory for every Western ever made. One of the most memorable scenes from Ghost Rock is when one of Busey's henchmen gets his hand chopped off and acts as if it was a minor wound. He somehow stays fine the entire film with no medical treatment, as I'm sure the Wild West didn't have a whole slew of options. So instead of him bleeding out or getting gang green, he just kept going about his business with his handless arm wrapped up by his shirt sleeve. Now that is just perfect B logic through and through.",1424995200,3,3775,4.50948905109489
