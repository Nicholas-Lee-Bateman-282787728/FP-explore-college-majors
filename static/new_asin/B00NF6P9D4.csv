6647789,5,B00NF6P9D4,"this excellent spy series will keep you wanting more until the very end of episode 6. It has all the characteristics of a good spy story, double crossings at many levels, deceit of many layers, a mole, etc. The story is very well written, well directed and the acting is very believable.
Towards the end the story may be a bit exaggerated, but this is after all ""entertainment"" and not ""journalism"".
I like John le Carre, le Carre writing is somewhat more sober, but IMHO this is more exciting. Highly recommended for lovers of spy movies, but also for anyone who enjoys a good story. Highly recommended

Other recent BBC shows (Broadchurch, Hinterland) suffer from the same affliction so some must like the dreary notes.  I couldn't warm to the actors themselves and, at times, found some of their acting downright bad.  Too many of the characters seemed stereotyped.  I did find the overall premise interesting although at 6 episodes, it was a bit too long.

6647796,3,B00NF6P9D4,"ok, bit pricey. Would be better at half-price.

There is english subtitle for hearing impaired - too bad there just wasn't one for non-hearing impaired.

There are no extras, pity. Would have liked trailers at least, interviews, and commentary.

Not in the same league as le carre ""Tinker,tailor...""

Like Tinker,tailor made for TV. Some things are left hanging such as future of Joe & Yulia, Bobby & Wendy.

There are some things that don't seem to makr sense such as why Joe Lambre wasn't finished off several times when KGB had him dead cold - didn't seem important for KGB to frame Joe when KGB could complete operation Glass without Joe. I don't see why KGB couldn't assassinate the PM without Yulia. Don't need Yulia to get Joe's fingerprints in the rifle. It wasn't clear why Joe wanted to keep his father's alive a secret. A little nit was why the episodes weren't titled as in Tinker,tailor. In Tinker,tailor the identity and faith of the mole ended cleanly. In The Game things seem to be left hanging.

It wasn't clear how Joe convinced Daddy that he wasn't a traitor, and how KGB trap was turned around.

6647797,4,B00NF6P9D4,"TRADECRAFT IS LESS THAN PERFECT, BUT THE ATMOSPHERE AND ACTING ARE TERRIFIC!

This six part series came with much anticipation and tantalizing promises of a more authentic spy thriller with an intellectual approach.  Whether you appreciate it or not depends on what you expected an what you can forgive.  It is very atmospheric and I enjoyed it for that fact.  It borrows very vaguely from real world British Intelligence events and even dangles a few possibilities in characters that will have intelligence historians guessing.  It certainly attempts to have a less flamboyant and more intellectual style like the works of Le Carre.  In the end, it abandons realistic intelligence tradecraft at times to advance the story over what would normally be real practices.  However, the character development and acting were exceptional and many will find it very entertaining despite it's methodic pace.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Joe Lambe is a MI-5 (British domestic Counterintelligence) agent in early 1970's cold war era espionage.  The story begins briefly with his relationship with Russian asset Yulia with whom he falls in love.  In a sequence of events, he is compromised during an exchange by another ruthless KGB assassin we come to know as code name Odin, and things get ugly.  Moving forward, Joe is back at MI-5, but haunted by past events in Russia.  He becomes involved in a new case with Russian double agent Arkady who informs MI-5 of an impending KGB operation so great in scope that it will alter the course of the Cold War.  This series of events called ""Operation Glass"" will challenge MI-5 at it's highest levels as they struggle to understand what the enemy has in store.  Joe is at the center of this investigation and his allegiances will be tested as he realizes the same operative named Odin is also involved in Operation Glass.  His thirst for vengeance must be weighed against duty to country.  MI-5 will also find itself entangled at cross purpose with MI-6 (British SIS focusing on foreign intelligence similar to CIA) where their investigations overlap.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  The initial approach feels more authentic in that it is not as sensational as a Fleming novel. This means the pace is also slower and won't appeal to some American audiences.  However, the authentic feel wavers as the ""tradecraft"" (term for spy methods and procedures) is very poor at points in the series.  For those just looking for entertainment and atmosphere, that's not a huge problem.  I felt conflicted as the movie throws out nuggets clearly designed for spy historians and those from within the community, yet ignored the chance for substantial and authentic tradecraft in a movie that FEELs like that was its original design.  The story ultimately reverts to entertainment and does throw in some more sensational elements that are less realistic but perhaps entertaining.  The characters were excellent, but sometimes not explored to their full potential.  The story is engaging and there are terrific moments of dry British humor created by contrast to the seriousness of events.  Though the methodic pace is characteristic of detailed and well built BBC drama, the departure from authentic tradecraft methods seemed like an uncharacteristic miss by BBC.  Fellow fans should not be put off by this critique if you still enjoy the drama and atmosphere.  I am a fan of this show.  With some exposure to the community and a fan of both Le Carre and Fleming, I am simply attempting an honest appraisal so other's can decide where they fall in.  If the series sounds interesting, I suggest starting with a rental.",1424044800,16,3619,5.013400335008376
6647798,5,B00NF6P9D4,"The British do this kind of spy story so well.  MI-5 would be the rough equivalent of the F.B.I. in Britain and MI-6 the C.I.A.  This particular six part tale of daring do is set in the early Seventies when the Cold War was still very much afoot but about to be shaken to its core by the visit of Richard Nixon to China but until then a lull of inactivity followed by decades of dirty cold war politics that has left a bad taste in everybody's mouth when it comes to the give and take (sometimes lives) between Russia and England while MI-5 deals almost daily with the homegrown terrorism posed by the I.R.A. at the same time.

Our story here opens with a scene of defection that isn't quite clear in it's presentation to the viewer and quite nightmarish in it's outcome as it deals with the main player in the story to come, Joe Lambe (played by a striking Tom Hughes, who's physical beauty is remarked upon by the players in our game several times until it becomes the outward sign of nothing going on beneath but seething hunger for revenge).  All goes wrong in this planned exchange of defectors into Russian hands and thus begins one of the most intricate and carefully crafted plots I've seen in a long long time. Pay careful attention to what your eyes do see and what they don't see in this beginning scene as it will haunt you and Joe throughout what follows.  Flash forward a year later we dive into the inner core of MI-5 and a special task force brought together by Daddy (the anonymous head of MI-5 - played by the most recognizable face at the table, Brian Cox - Agamemnon in Troy - The General who made Wolverine etc).  Filled with characters that are fleshed out before your eyes and laid bare in all their ambitions and loyalties and personal lives, this task force will deal with a new threat to British security known as Operation Glass.

I don't like to give too much away about plots when I review a movie or a TV show in this case.  Suffice it to say our players know nothing about Glass except that it appears to have some basis in truth because of an informant named Arkady (played with world weary calm masking mortal terror by Marcel Iures) who has been contacted by his Russian handlers after years of inactivity to act as a courier to their other players in this chess match and has chosen to tip the Brits in a bid to protect something that will become clear down the line.  At first the investigation is routine yet baffling and Joe Lambe still reeling a year later from what happened at that defector exchange and having had his career saved by Daddy is just going through the motions in tracking down the truth of Arkady's story until he gets a whiff of Odin (a Russian enforcer who works in Britain taking care of operatives who step out of line with the Kremlin) and for reasons you will know it instantly becomes personal.

The other players on our British side of the chessboard are played with precise care by each actor showing vulnerabilities on their sleeves or deceiving themselves or others in matching their desires to the game at hand until you're sure of everybody standing before you and yet sure of no one, not even Joe Lambe, our less than sterling hero.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the people at the table First the defacto Daddy 2nd, Sarah Montag (played by Victoria Hamilton) and her husband Alan the techie (Jonathan Aris),  Detective Constable Jim Fenchurch drafted from the local police (Shaun Dooley), Bobby Waterhouse (Daddy's nominal 2nd in command - Paul Ritter) and last but not least Wendy Straw (Chloe Pirrie) because all of them turn out to be equally amazing characters.

Tho still not up to the superb level of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy - not since then have I been so invested in the outcome of a British spy story.  Nor do I think...will you escape its web either.  But it does have something TTSS didn't - black humor played for black humor via Alan Montag.

It is superbly done, with British actors you may not be familiar with but who are equals to the ones we see so often on the Big Screen.  It is six episodes and it grips until the end.  It is also a series on BBC One and I believe has been selected for inclusion on BBC America so watch for it.  I have no word on whether it has been picked up for a second series yet.

If you like the British take on spying then this is the entertainment you've been waiting for.  Surely it will make a star out of Tom Hughes in England and insure his employment on both sides of the pond and if some Hollywood visionary watches perhaps it will mean lots of work for the entire cast in the near future.  It's that good.

I highly recommend.",1423872000,14,4661,4.406759906759906
6647799,2,B00NF6P9D4,"Based on the premise that the USSR saw the UK as such a threat the USSR would do almost anything & everything to neutralize the UK.  YEAH, right!
Otherwise the acting & plot were good",1495065600,,183,4.228571428571429
6647800,3,B00NF6P9D4,"I had supposed the Cold War thriller as a dramatic form to be extinct, like masques or passion plays, or at the very least moribund. After all, even John LeCarr&eacute;, generally considered the greatest living master of the genre, has sensibly, although not, I suspect, without a pang, moved on to depictions of contemporary mischief.

But after all, if Regency romances continue to be written and sold, and if an Edwardian costume soaper like Downton Abbey finds rapt audiences on either side of the pond, why should we not find creative spirits drawn to those fraught decades when the Soviet Union and the West were ideologically at daggers drawn, each side desiring the extirpation of the rival ethos; each in dread of the others intentions and of its ordnance? Now *there* was an existential threat worthy of some serious knicker-twisting! Theres still drama to be mined

The fact that we know how the story turned outno one pushed the button; no one perished defending the Fulda Gap; the Red Russians renounced their wicked ways, or at least exchanged many of them for our wicked waysdoes pose some issues for the storyteller, which brings us to the entry under consideration here, the 2014 six-part BBC series The Game. There will be minor spoilers in my discussion.

I have alluded to John LeCarr&eacute;, who pretty much holds the patent on Cold War spy fiction, and whose oeuvre is the yardstick against which all contenders and pretenders are perforce to be measured. By its major plot elements the series does not merely invite but positively compels comparison with the 1979 BBC dramatization of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and this juxtaposition does not flatter the newer production.

We are once again made privy to discussions in the upper echelons of British Intelligence (The Circus in LeCarr&eacute;s world; here doing business as MI5one of the series few unimpeachable touches of verisimilitude) as its senior officers ponder the measures that must be taken to thwart the latest covert assaults by international communism upon the British Way of Life as it is lived in 1972. There are the obligatory touches of moral ambiguity (alas, we are obliged from time to time to undertake questionable measures in defense of our ancient liberties and our values, and its a jolly good thing that the latter are incontestably preferable to those of the foe, else our slumbers would be troubled by the prickings of such vestiges of conscience as we have retained) that have been expected of British spy fiction since The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. Theres the long-time chief of the operation, like Tinker, Tailors Control an embattled, lonely figure who has to contend with swinish, obdurate politicals above and scheming, ambitious subordinates beneath. In fact, lets meet our principals, shall we?

Theres the aforementioned chief, a shrewd, corpulent, raddled character known to his team only as Daddy.

Bobby Waterhouse, Daddys deputy: an aging, expensively-tailored (well, by the standards of 1972, I suppose. In one scene the points of his shirt collar terminate somewhere in the neighborhood of his armpits. I am obliged to recuse myself from any critical discussion of the fashion and grooming choices made during this period) nancy-boy who is itching to put the bureaucratic shiv in paters back. Bobbys actual pater is not in the picture, but his formidable mother has a few scenes, and frankly, Id rely on *her* to hold the Fulda Gap in a pinch.

Wendy Straw, Daddys pert secretary (the actress puts me in mind of the young Rita Tushingham), whom MI5 appears to be grooming for field work, being as how the outfit appears to be chronically understaffed (see below).

Alan Montag, the bearded Aspergerish tech boffin who can with equal facility paper a room with concealed microphones or wire an intelligence source with a transmitter so small you could fit it into a golf bag. This is 1972, remember.

Sarah Montag, Alans wife and one of the agencys top analystsshes one of the first to raise aloud the possibility that someone on Daddys inner team might be playing for the other sideand a crackerjack field agent. A candy mint and a breath mint!

and finally, looking as though he has just arrived on the set from a GQ photo shoot, our protagonist, tousle-haired young Joe Lambe, an even better field agent than Sarah. In fact, hes the star of MI5, Daddys golden boy, and Im here to tell you that on the evidence of this series, if Joe was the best they had, the UK would have been a Soviet Socialist Republic by 1973.

These are The Spies Who Dont Know Any Better Than To Come in from the Cold. The story relies repeatedly and unduly on the convenient idiot plot: Yes, mate, we want you to meet a deadly Soviet assassin in this basement room and worm important information from him. And don't worry. Me and Alan will be monitoring you from our listening post on the tenth floor, and if something looks to go wrong well be down here in, like three minutes. Or So youve got vital information on a mole within MI5, have you? Well, youll be absolutely secure in this safe houseof course it is. Where do you think the expression safe as houses comes from? How certain are we? Well if we *werent* certain, wed have sent someone on ahead to make certain there wasn't an armed Red concealed in the laundry room, wouldnt we? Intelligence assets perish, bad guys routinely elude surveillance (not surprising, since MI5 apparently has only Bobby, Wendy, the Montags and Joe, plus a policeman seconded to the operation, as field operatives to keep tabs on the Bolshies), and the Russians are constantly getting the drop on our heroes. Perhaps more ludicrously, the entire tale requires us to believe that forty some-odd years ago the senior echelons of the British intelligence community were worried sick about the possibility of an imminent Soviet military invasion of the kingdom.

The series has a few worthwhile set pieces, and the latter episodes proceed a little more briskly. Notwithstanding a few red herrings strewn about, I correctly guessed the infiltrator about halfway through. If you fancy a Cold War thriller (or plodder), and are prepared to withhold comparisons with more distinguished examples of the genre, you might be entertained.",1492560000,3,6267,4.907459867799811
