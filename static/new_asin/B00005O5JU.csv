7948377,5,B00005O5JU,"Obviously this film is outdated by now, as it precedes the country's economic collapse in 2001.  Traveler Justine Shapiro's only complaint about Argentina is that it is too expensive- and these days, it's considered a traveler's bargain.

However, this video makes a great effort to achieve authenticity, despite the necessary superficiality of such a brief tour.  We are introduced to Argentinian musicians playing late into the night at a caf, an American living on $2,000 a day in Patagonia, an eccentric artist who built a garden out of trash, tango dancers, penguins, Argentina's striking and diverse landscape, and much more.  Justine's presentation is honest and very human- she is by turns portrayed as hung over, forgetful (trying to remember the name of the Train to the Clouds), and squeamish (watching a cow get slaughtered).  Most importantly, she is humble and curious about Argentinean culture, an attitude that is necessary to discover what this great country has to offer.",1128729600,,989,5.234177215189874
