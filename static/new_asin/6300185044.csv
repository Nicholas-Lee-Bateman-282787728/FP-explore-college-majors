221603,5,6300185044,"I WAS WANTING THIS MOVIE SO BAD TO COMPLETE MY WHOLE COLLECTION OF CHARLES BRONSON MOVIES. I EVEN HAVE THE MOVIES UNDER HIS BIRTH NAME BRINKINSKI I BELIEVE THAT'S HOW IT IS SPELL. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SPEED OF GETTING THE MOVIE TO ME AND THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIE WHEN IT ARRIVED. I HAD NEVER EVER SEEN THE MOVIE UNTIL IT GOT HERE TO ME, THEN WE MADE POPCORN AND SET DOWN WITH OUR DRINKS AND WATCHED ONE OF CHARLES BEST PERFORMANCES AS THE REAL TOUGH GUY THAT HE HAS BUILT UP HIS REPRESENTATION. MR. BRONSON IS A GREAT ACTOR AND I SURE MISS HIM. MY HEART JUST SANK INTO THE LOWER PART OF MY STOMACH WHEN I HEARD THAT HE WENT TO HEAVEN. HE IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MISSED. HE IS UP THERE WITH THE OTHER KING ELVIS WHICH BRONSON HAD STARED IN 3 OF ELVIS'S MOVIES BUT HIS BEST PERFORMANCE WAS KID GALAHAD.",1302048000,,805,4.0375
221604,2,6300185044,"Two episodes of the old Virginian series spliced together do not a good movie make.

Boo-boo in the film (warning, the following is a spoiler, of sorts:  The kid does not want his father to whip him, so he shoots his father with a six-shooter.  The problem is the six-shooter wasn't invented when the guy was a kid.

Whoops!",1112659200,,324,4.440677966101695
221605,2,6300185044,"What this is is an attempt to edit two seperate episodes of The Virginian tv series into one story. The story line of two brothers (Bronson and Marvin) and the seperate paths they took would have worked better had there been smoother editing. It becomes most painfully obvious during the final five minutes.  Beyond that, if you would like to see both actors in their earlier years, rent if possible.",1035158400,7,400,4.714285714285714
221606,1,6300185044,"I'm still wondering how in the world Hollywood's two of the best stars got into this terrible mess! What a waste! Charlie & Marvin fans should stay away from this one. Regardless of the reviews that I read from IMDB I bought this DVD last year & I'm still regreting it. Take my advise, keep this away from your collection.",1034121600,8,322,4.383333333333334
221607,1,6300185044,"I'd advice anybody to stay away from this tape, even Bronson-fans. Don't get me wrong; it's a fine little TV-western, Bronson's good as always, it's a good cast in general, but the picture quality is not very good. -But  that's just a minor problem. In fact, the tape's in the awful EP mode. -And  at such a hefty price, too. Very disappointing, indeed. Shame on you  ""Goodtimes Home Video"", for releasing something like this, at a  price the double of what it's really worth. It would be nice if  ""Amazon.com"" could note the speed-mode of the tapes.",934070400,22,550,4.628865979381444

7804530,3,6300185044,"I have been watching Westerns since about 1964.  This one is not so great, but it manages to keep your interest.  It is a very low-budget movie that has poor camera angles, cheap props, and even ""uses scenes multiple times"".  What do I mean?  There is a scene where Lee Marvin gets on his horse and rides through town.  About 5 minutes after they showed this scene, they showed the exact same scene AGAIN (same film footage).  In another scene, Lee Marvin is shown aiming his six-shooter at a cowboy. Later, they use the exact same scene (film footage), to show Lee Marvin pointing his gun at a train engineer.  Also, some outdoor scenes are obviously filmed in a studio....and it is VERY obvious. In addition, I can tell that some of the outdoor scenes were filmed in the hills near Los Angeles.  How can I tell?  I grew up near L.A. when the smog was so thick you could cut it with a knife.  In some scenes, you can see a thick layer of smog in the background.  Even with all these faults, I managed to watch the entire movie.  Why?  Because Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson are the two main characters.  Plus, the acting and storyline are good enough to keep you interested.",1503273600,,1175,4.404651162790698

7804534,3,6300185044,"Quick to the draw, where life goes quickly in a blink in an eye. Nice job by Bronson, showing exceptional acting skills, nice mexican wife and baby scene, sweet and ugly seldom seen child abuse early. A bit of a mixed up ending, but whose watching, just an exceptional Western otherwise.",1436486400,,287,4.647058823529412

7804537,3,6300185044,"Two-part television series episodes can make for clunky theatrical feature releases, but ""The Meanest..."" has some extra dramatic scenes included. I noted that the recurring characters of ""The Virginian"" T.V. series are not introduced as clearly as might have been done. It's not the best work of this good cast, but for a wholesome Western to watch with the kids at home on a Saturday morning, it's ideal entertainment. Bronson and Marvin are the film's stars with the series players taking a back seat. Bronson gets the most screen time and turns in a good performance. The great Lee J. Cobb appears as the Judge with James Drury as the Virginian. Doug McClure appears briefly, too, as one of the series regular ranch hands. If you liked the series, this is a fun movie-length momento of its successful network run in the 1960s. It's a family film with a grownup, socially relevant lesson about the high price of domestic violence.",1389398400,,933,4.8375
7804538,3,6300185044,"I'm a huge Charles Grodin fan because he's one of the best comedians in movies, I had never heard of this movie, but when I saw that he was in it, I ordered it. The movie was okay, I didn't hate it, but I was disappointed in Grodin's role. He was too serious.",1385683200,,259,3.9056603773584904
