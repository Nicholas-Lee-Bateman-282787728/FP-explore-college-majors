4160678,5,B003NOCXB4,"Great movie!  Acting is A+, and keeps you entertained throughout.  It is in B&W, but that seems to make it better.  This is a really cut down entertaining view of Hank's short life in Country Music.  I am surprised this isn't shown more on Cable TV, but if you want to see it you pretty much have to purchase the DVD.",1320192000,3,317,4.147540983606557
4160679,3,B003NOCXB4,I was very happy to get this on DVD. I have been a big fan of Hank Sr from the time he played on WSFA in Momtgomery. In my opinion he was the greatest country singer that ever lived. I have read a lot of books about Hank. The movie left out a lot. But I guess they can't put everything in.,1305504000,4,289,3.6774193548387095
4160680,5,B003NOCXB4,"I purchased this item after having looked everywhere else and thinking I would never find it....It was just what I was looking for, and priced adequately for its antiquity....I will always look at Amazon first before attempting to search elsewhere. Thanks for the value!",1302220800,4,270,5.159090909090909
4160681,5,B003NOCXB4,"This is the closest, factual, portrayal, of the Hank Williams' story available. This movie was originally, released back in the 1960's. I remember seeing it on TV, as a child. This DVD is a re-issue, re-mastered, edition of this classic movie. It's not ""full screen"", but it's definitely, well worth the purchase, for a Hank, fan, like myself. I've studied the history of Hank Williams, and I know his life's story very well.

This movie starts off with Hank as a young boy, shinning shoes, and singing, while his Black,""Street Musician"",Bluesman friend ""Tee-Tot"", plays the guitar. ""Tee-Tot"" is very impressed with Hank's singing, and how the ""word's & original"", songs, just naturally come to him. ""Tee-Tot"" (Rufus Payne) is the black man who taught Hank, how to play the guitar.

It covers, the young man, Hank, in a traveling, ""medicine show"", and singing, & playing the guitar. (Hank was a headliner, on one of the last, greatest medicine shows, to travel throughout the South, selling ""Hadacol"").

It covers Hank meeting & marrying ""Miss Audrey"", and his union with the Drifting Cowboy Band. It covers his early success in Montgomery, his success performing on the Louisiana Hayride, radio show, live from Shreveport, Louisiana, and Hank's first record deal, with Rose/Acuff. It covers the birth of his son Randall Hank Jr. It covers his tenure on the Grand Ole Opry, in Nashville. It covers his problems about getting drunk, and not being able to perform at times.

It's not completely, true to life, but it is very close. The characters are all well portrayed. George Hamilton stars, as Hank Williams, and ""lip-synchs"", Hanks songs, while Hank, Jr. actually sings the songs, and he sounds just like his daddy on this movie. On the cover of the dvd movie it states you can hear these Hank Williams songs: ""Cold Cold Heart"", ""just waitin"", ""ramblim man"", ""Long Gone Lonesome Blues"", ""I saw the Light"", ""Your cheatin' Heart"", ""Jambalaya"", ""Kawliga"", ""Hey good lookin"", & ""Roll them up Pete"". However, after viewing this move serveral times, I realized that not all off these songs are in the actual movie. Some of them are, also in the movie you get the song ""I Can't Help It If I'm Still in Love With You"". I think what they were referring to was the soundtrack to this movie, containing songs sung by Hank Jr.

It covers his death, and the announcement of his death, at the concert, he was traveling, to perform at, when he died. The crowd responds by singing, ""I saw the Light"".

This is a great classic, that any true Hank Williams fan would certainly enjoy. I know I really enjoy mine. Thanks!!!",1301184000,51,2605,4.8165548098434

4160707,5,B003NOCXB4,"Your Cheatin' Heart is one of those rare treasures that I have been looking to find on DVD for many years. I have a personal history with this movie. More on that later.
  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the picture on this DVD. It has been restored from a very good answer print or negative. The only scratches I saw that were really noticable were in the MGM LOGO.
  This movie was lensened in panavision.
  ( cinamascope). It is enhanced for widescreen
T. V' s. It is in Black and White which I think adds to the time period of the movie.
  This is by no means an accurate account of Hank Williams life Story. Rather a watered down version intended to entertain it's audiance.
  George Hamilton is very credible as Hank Williams. He does a near perfect job lipsynking Hank Williams Jr's singing.
  When I was 15 years old I became the main projectionest at MAXIE THEATRE in Trumann Arkansas. I worked there for 4 and 1/2 Years 7 days a week without missing a day. We played
Your Cheatin' Heart at least once a year every year that I worked there. The Maxie had the largest indoor screen in Northeast Ark. It seated
 435 people. Your Cheatin' Heart would sell out every time we booked it. Every year. What a money maker this picture was.",1510617600,,1254,4.4

The songs were presented in full and in context, which more than anything else depicts the essence of the person, the music, and the reason people loved him. Hamilton is totally convincing as Williams, perhaps because the experience of the real man was still fresh when the movie was made.",1467331200,2,364,4.703125

He seemed just a little too posh. There were a few awkward scenes in the movie; however it was still interesting to me as a sign of the times and lack of finesse and knowledge back then. I did feel the movie was slanted to portray Hank's wife as more caring than I believe she was. It did not bring in his daughter and other lover that I had read about. I am very much looking forward to the new Hank movie coming out in January2016. I feel that more is known about him now; and hope the movie will go into more detail about this complex but simple Shakespeare and genius of country music.",1447027200,2,747,4.08843537414966

4160881,3,B003NOCXB4,George Hamilton was surprisingly good considering what he had to work with.  This movie was too clearly influenced by Audrey Williams.  It made it appear that she made him a star.  He was already on his way when they met and would have made it regardless of her.  They showed him injuring his back and the pain it caused but skirted the issue of him taking drugs to relieve the pain.  His death in the movie made no sense because of this.  He was definitely not on the wagon as they claimed.  I loved that they used Hank Jr.'s voice and not Hank Sr.'s.  That would have been too much of a stretch.  Not a great film but worthwhile for a Hank Williams fan.,1428192000,,655,4.217741935483871

4160884,2,B003NOCXB4,"A vague history of Hank William's life. Much was left out & Hamilton plays him as an ignorant hillbilly.  Hank Williams was not ignorant & he had a serious medical condition that wasn't even mentioned. It seems as if the film was written to highlight Hamilton's talents.  I found the movie to be cheap & not worthy of anyone who wants to know about Hank Williams. Some of the movie was pure fiction & the acting on Hamilton's part poor.  Would I watch this again?  No, never.  There are quite a few good movies around about Han Williams' life that are both entertaining and truthful.  At the end, I wondered why they even bothered to make the movie.",1426896000,5,649,4.4576271186440675

4160950,2,B003NOCXB4,"This movie of the late great Hank Williams the greatest singer song writer in American history is more fiction than truth. The movie could have been called the ""life and times or rather the tales of Audrey Williams"" and would have still been a work of fiction. The original  band members of the drifting cowboys were completely missing in this movie. The band in this movie are all fictional characters which is an insult to the memory of Hank Williams and all the amazing men of the drifting cowboy band. This one fact alone makes this movie fiction and a total distortion of the great singer and his band. However, that is not the only distortion. The movie opens with Audrey, her aunt, and some fictional character that becomes a major band member. The three are driving through a small town and come across a medicine show with Hank singing to draw a crowd. Hank Williams did sing at a medicine show and he did meet Audrey at one of these performances. Sadly however, the movie completely distorts this scene.  The movie portrays Audrey and this other character as the original singing cowboy band and they invite Hank to leave the medicine show and join their band. That one distortion alone is enough to send this movie to fairy tale land. The rest of the movie centers more on the life and times of Audrey and of course it portrays her in glowing light. Hopefully one day an accurate movie will be made of Hank Williams. As all Hank Williams fans know this great American icon was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, one of the greatest awards bestowed upon individuals in 2010.

The ending of the movie is also distorted of any historical accuracy. The closing scene of the movie pictures the New Year's Day (January 1, 1953)crowd waiting for the appearance of Hank Williams to perform his show. A fictional character played by Red Buttons, and band member of Audrey's so-called Drifting Cowboys that appeared in the opening scene of the movie walked out on stage and announced the death of Hank Williams. Some one in the audience stood up and began singing Williams song, I saw the light. The camera then swings over and finds Audrey and Hank Jr. standing off stage with tears in their eyes. This is another distortion, Audrey nor Hank Jr. was there. In fact Audrey had left Hank Williams the year before.

The movie also leaves out Hank Williams life for the entire year of 1952. In the spring of 1952 Hank Williams had and off and on relationship with a young beautiful woman named Bobby Jet. Bobby Jet conceived and gave birth to a baby girl a few days after the death of Hank Williams. Again, the movie completely failed to mention this.

Also in the summer of 1952 Hank Williams met a beautiful young woman from Louisiana, named Billie Jean Jones. Hank Williams was smitten by her beauty and they were married on October 19, 1952. Again the movie, ""Your Cheating Heart"" says nothing about Hank's marriage to Billie Jean.

The only reason this movie garners two stars is due to the onscreen performance, presence, and beauty of Actress Susan Oliver. Oliver portrayed Audrey Williams.",1406592000,10,3088,4.677716390423573

Warner Archives DVDR format usually plays great but this one sucks! Watching this movie I was flabbergasted by the inaccuracies in the film. Audrey Williams had a big hand in this film & how she & Hank were portrayed. 1. Audrey DID NOT have a traveling band when she met Hank Sr. 2. The film makes no mention of the fact that the two were divorced when Hank Sr died on New Years Eve 1952. 3. The Song Hank Sr sang at his Grand Ol' Opry debut in 1949 was ""Lovesick Blues"", which is not even performed or mentioned in the film. Audrey was not the best of singers but her duets with Hank Sr were listenable, none of those are performed in the film. I could go on & on but this is a decent fictional film, I gave it a poor rating because DVD worked improperly. The one saving grace is that a 14 year old Hank Williams Jr performs the songs of his father. The arrangements of the songs are of a 1960's Nashville Sound & not of the gutbucket hillbilly sound of the Great Hank Williams Sr. The movie is entertaining in a hokey way....The actors do a decent job, especially Susan Oliver as Audrey Williams....",1401667200,4,1217,4.205128205128205

The whole film feels like it was created to hopefully redefine Audrey's legacy for the history books, which is a real shame, the real story is so much more dark, mysterious, and legendary. This film is definitely a watered down over glamorized caricature of Hanks life that was most likely created under the supervision of Audrey, so she could see herself portrayed in a movie the way she wanted to be remembered.",1398211200,5,642,4.741071428571429

4161000,5,B003NOCXB4,"Not so long ago this film was considered terrible; Colin Escott--Hank Williams sort of ""official"" biographer--totally dimissed it in his bio of Hank some 15-20 years ago. But time can  change the perception of art over a period of years--this can be true of a painting; a piece of sculpture; a book a sound recording or in this case a film--""Moby Dick was dismissed in the 1850's--but 75 years later it was ""re-discovered""; The Three Stooges made inane short films for 25-30 years--but one day we  realized the guys were producing vest-pocket works of art.
the film ""Your Cheating Heart"" might be in the same category; George Hamilton is not talked about so much in a negative way in this Century--in the late 1960's we called him a draft-dodger; than he became that ""tan"" guy--- today, we can look at his films, and perhaps say--""he's not a bad actor"" hmmmmmm---and yes a 15 year old Hank Jr does a fine job on the songs--THAT helps--I can recall George Hamiltion on the ""Mike Douglas Show"" a short while after this film came out, and I was struck by  how proud he was to have played Hank in the film--yes George, maybe you and Susan Oliver did OK--and it is nice to see Susan Oliver in a film--she guest-starred on every TV show in the 1960's--nice-looking woman... and yes,the film is not historically accurate--but entertaining nonetheless.",1387584000,,1344,4.735042735042735

I expected George Hamilton to be the parody of himself I think of him as, but he turns in a solid performance (not including the songs--they're freshly recorded, remarkably, by then-15-year-old Hank Williams Jr.).  If you're a Williams fan, it won't hurt your collection, and it's pretty good for the old-movie buff.",1340236800,10,639,4.844036697247707
4161066,3,B003NOCXB4,"This movie is one of my all time favorites and remastering has given it high quality in DVD.
I am sure I watched it a few times on TV in the past in full color so it was disapointing to
have it arrive in Black & White.
All of Hank Williams numbers in the movie are done by Hank Williams Jnr. and he sings exactly like his father.
If you enjoy Hank Williams then this is the Movie to have, covering his whole short life having sadly passed away at 29 years old.",1335916800,12,460,3.956989247311828
4161067,5,B003NOCXB4,"I first saw this movie on TV about 25 years ago and taped in several years later off TV. Being a HW fan, it's great to see this restored and in wide screen (first time for me). Although I don't usually support re-makes of old movies, this story and this person could use a revival (""Walk the Line"" biopic of Johnny Cash for example). I wish (as with most movies) a complete soundtrack could be released with the background score and incidental music included. Hank Williams, though he only lived a short time, was one of the biggest influences on country music and composed all his own songs (gifted).",1332720000,13,601,4.522935779816514

4161069,5,B003NOCXB4,"I had seen this as a movie on TV years ago and wondered if it was for sale. As Hank Williams, Sr. is from Alabama, as am I, I have a certain pride in his brief, tragic career. He wrote so many songs with the music and touched lives then as well as today. The patients in my Pulmonary Rehab clinic in SC love his music and will talk about seeing him. The job George Hamilton performed was outstanding! I would also recommend the one about Hank Williams, Jr performed by Richard Thomas is excellent also.",1329264000,5,502,4.239583333333333

8401290,3,B003NOCXB4,I saw this movie with my parents when I was about four years old.  The first thing I remember about it was Hank Williams hat.  I don't know why but that always stood out for me.  George Hamilton does a great job playing Hank Williams.  I think it was a good enough to be nominated for an Oscar.  And the soundtrack has Hank Jr.  doing all the hank songs.  And I believe originally the soundtrack was a smash. And I have been a big Hank Jr. fan.  So from what I have heard the movie isn't really very accurate.
