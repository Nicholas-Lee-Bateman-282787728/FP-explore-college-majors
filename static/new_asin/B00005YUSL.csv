1678845,5,B00005YUSL,"How I got ""suckered"" into seeing this no-name movie was because a friend had extra tickets.  Our school [Go bears!] was playing a screener to see before it came out at the theatres.  Anyway, I was skeptical of this movie because it had no big-name actors and a lack of any action.  However, since the movie was free so I figured I would stay throughout the entire thing.  The movie was a little bit slow to start, building up the plot and setting the scenes.  As the movie continued, you can see how each character begins to gradually change by the ""building of the house.""  I don't want to give away too much, but I definitely recommend this movie.  Even if you're not into thought provoking movies, it surprisingly has a lot of funny moments.  They were able to show funny scenes through normal everyday life.  Needless to say, if you bring a girl, you better bring some tissues as well.  My friend was bawling by the end =).",1004054400,2,927,4.431952662721893
1678846,4,B00005YUSL,"Life as a House is not the most original movie you'll ever see, but for what it is, it's wonderful. George, Kevin Klein's character, is living a miserable life when the movie begins. He is divorced from his ex-wife who he still loves; estranged from his 16 year-old son, who is unhappy and using drugs; and hates his home, a shack on a beautiful cliff in Malibu. Then one day George visits his ex-wife, who asks him to take their son, Sam, for the summer; loses his job; and finds out he has only a few months to live. George decides to tear down the shack, which his dad willed to him and he hates, and build a house he'll be proud to give his son. He tells his ex he'll take Sam for the summer, so that they can help each other, and tells no one of his cancer. The scenery and cinematography in this movie alone make it worth seeing. There are breathtaking scenes from the cliff in Malibu, as well as from the ex-wife's back yard; and that's where most of the movie takes place. The story may not be a new one, but it is beautiful. There are some seemingly unnecessary sub-plots I could've done without, and some of the characters needed more dept or explaining, but the main characters feel like people you've known for years. The movie is a little over 2 hours, but does not drag throughout, a big feat considering it's a drama, and doesn't try to be anything more. This movie won't challenge you, but would be nice for a quite evening out; it needs to be seen on a big screen. I recommend it.",1003276800,39,1497,4.274647887323944

1678892,5,B00005YUSL,"This is a noteworthy movie. George Monroe (Kevin Kline) has had a lifelong ambition to achieve one of the great American Dreams: to build his own home, a refuge set on a cliff at the end of the sea. But it's a dream that George has put off again and again while he's sunk lower and lower, ending up divorced, overworked and estranged not only from friends and family, but from himself. Now George has hit rock bottom and there's nowhere to go, except out onto the edge.

Hayden Christensen appeared in this movie before playing Anakin Skywalker in Attack of the Clones. For his part in this movie, Christensen lost 25 pounds through a special diet. The film is set in picturesque Rancho Palos Verdes, California.",1506729600,,712,4.606299212598425

1678919,4,B00005YUSL,"Most of the time people go to movies to escape the reality of life. If it's a real needs the movie? In this case it is that reality that is used as a diversion. You find yourself routing and cringing from it all the characters. If you've been around anybody who's dying or the people they've been around that person than you could really recognize them in this movie. And you can definitely see Kevin Klein's hand in this movie.

This is the story of an old curmudgeon who you'd like to like but he just won't let you. Realizing his own mortality he attempts to make amends. This takes the form of building a house and rebuilding relationships that parallel. I don't mean for this movie to sound like some philosophical artsy type film. It is just people being people.

Aside from the movie the DVD has all the standard DVD goodies. The deleted scenes actually helped to realize what the story was all about.",1502323200,,908,4.463855421686747

1678951,3,B00005YUSL,"[Moderate Spoilers] I so love how ""Life As a House"" goes from one extreme to the other in just the film's first few minutes and how in about the first 1/2 hour you may feel like it's one of the best movies you've ever seen.  If only that great potential had been harnessed.  Single architect ""George"" (Kevin Kline) discovers that he doesn't have a lot of time left, in what can only initially be perceived by the viewer as a vague terminal illness.  Since ""Sam"" (Hayden Christensen), his 16-year-old son with ex-wife ""Robin"" (Kristin Scott Thomas), now living with his Mom and her new husband and their two sons, is at that rebellious age that we all hear about, George figures it's now or never to mend fences with his son via building the house he had set out to do decades before.  This also comes as great news to George's neighbors since, when the film opens, George's house is, shall we say, the bad banana in the bunch.  While these all seem like the makings of a great family charmer, this is not a family film (true to its R rating), and the director seems to be trying too hard by way of including unnecessary subplots involving George's next-door neighbors, played by the otherwise pleasant Mary Steenburgen and Jena Malone, and by way of Sam's ambiguous sexuality, which some may say ends up encouraging hate crimes (because sexuality is seemingly portrayed as a choice here, as if you can be gay Tuesday and straight Wednesday if you meet the right person).  In fact, there are a few scenes of awkward promiscuity that nearly sink the film for me, cementing it as a non-family film, including the bathroom scene between ""Alyssa"" (Malone) and Sam (very inappropriate, unnecessary, and uncomfortable for the viewer); when Alyssa's boyfriend drops by and only finds her Mom home (creepy, immoral, and illegal); and when Alyssa later finds George napping in the daytime (creepy and immoral).  In other words, what was the cinematic purpose of including Alyssa and her Mom in the film?  Doing away with those characters altogether would have trimmed the movie by a very necessary 20 minutes or so, enhancing the movie experience, since it clocks in at a lengthy 124 minutes (a shorter version of the film would've been more ideal, I'm sure).  Alas, however, as it stands, there is a distinct measure of highly credible performances by Kline himself (a former Oscar winner for ""A Fish Called Wanda""), Thomas, and (surprisingly) Christensen, at least enough to sustain this appealing, if somewhat flawed, heart-tugger.",1485561600,,2524,4.824074074074074

He comes to live with his dad for the summer as mom is just fed up with him.  He's the same with his dad, too.  But dad decides it's time to build his dream home himself, on his oceanfront property. He enlists his son to help, which he does begrudgingly because he needs the money.  I won't say more, but as the house gets built, things change.  A really lovely movie.

1679235,2,B00005YUSL,"This movie falls into a weird genre of ""inappropriate family-oriented movie."" It's basically just a ridiculously corny family/kids movie with coarse language, innuendo, and shower f**king scenes added in. The plot is so cheesy it's painful, and every single step of the movie is 100% predictable. If you dislike plot twists and suspense, and your entire wardrobe and house is colored beige, then you might enjoy the plot. For everyone else, it will be nauseating.
SPOILERS BELOW:
Many characters' relationships are poorly hatched, there's lots of character subplots that are irrelevant and go nowhere, the dialogue between characters is often pointless and awkward, and the primary relationships are both predictable and yet still fall short. The relationship of George and Robin is the worst offender for the total lack of realistic progression. At the beginning of the movie, she hates him. After a few meetings between them, she's in love with him again. What? The secondary relationship of Sam and Alyssa displays much better promise. It feels much more true and believable, as we see them develop from awkward flirting into trust and confidence. Now, Alyssa's mom and Josh, I can't even begin to explain why it was included or what purpose it played in the plot. It seems like its only purpose was in setting up the phone call situation and then Josh falling off the roof.
But the worst part of this movie was the end. What promise if any the beginning had was killed by the end. The ending felt rushed through, like too much time was spent of irrelevant side plots and then they ran out of time. There was no reflection, no closure, no ending of any sort you'd find in high quality cinema. What should have been the climax, George's death, was passed over with minimal impact. The most striking part of the movie, and it just felt mundane.
The only thing redeeming about this movie is the acting and the characters themselves. The characters are well played, believable, and clear. Their emotions are felt without words, and they're easily relatable. If only their spoken lines would have been half as good, this movie would have been much better.",1425772800,,2153,4.901369863013699

I really wanted to show this movie to my teens so we could discuss the positive themes.  However, there's an implied sex scene between a middle-aged woman and her daughter's boyfriend that doesn't add anything to the plot and made me skittish about letting the kids watch it.  I ended up fast forwarding through the two scenes in question.

In this case, I was dismayed to find that eight of the 27 low-star reviews were about problems with playing the disc which has nothing to do with whether or not this is a fine film (which I believe it is). Those folks should use the forum Amazon provides for addressing those kinds of issues with products. In another case, a reviewer obviously thought the film was great and gave it one star from not understanding the rating system. Yet another one-star review is listed (and thus counted) twice.  Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have seen all of these misuses of the review process; it's just the first time I have taken the time to comment.

1679324,5,B00005YUSL,"I made this purchase without really knowing what this movie was completely about. HUGE mistake.
I guess the best way to explain this is, this is an absolutely wonderful movie however the timing for myself watching this couldn't have been any worse. My Father had just died and I was sleepless so I bought several movies to try to keep myself occupied during sleepless nights. This is not a movie to watch right after dealing with a personal death. I am not usually emotional however this really hit hard. Its a very emotional movie.
A few months later my Aunt asked to borrow some DVDs and this was one she took, she called me and asked why I didn't warn her about this. It actually never occurred to me.
So you've been warned. This is a wonderful movie but can be pretty emotional so don't forget your Kleenex.

It is a story about inescapable reality handled very well.
There is a discussion in the movie about the realities of love. One character insists that love is more important than anything. The opposite character points out that love is ""not even close.""
It is a sensitive and sensible work that takes watchers over the top of illogic and beautifully shares further than shallow thoughts to a completely different leavel of gentle reality that helps the watcher to firm ground in tough times.
This movie achieves this without becoming maudlin or sad. It makes the watcher feel better about reality and more able to handle it. I value it highly.",1396137600,,723,5.033333333333333

1679413,5,B00005YUSL,"I'm amazed that this movie is so little known.  I love it because it begins with the many REAL ways that we fail in relationships.  Each failure was completely believable.  But slowly, amidst anger and patience, cutting words and forgiveness, listening beneath the surface and embrace, we can see how reconciliation is possible.  I will show this movie on a retreat that I'm soon to give to a college baseball team. I find this really a wonderful movie of compassionate transformation, though be it through a California-style, titillating fringe.

1679442,5,B00005YUSL,"I absolutely loved this movie. It really makes you appreciate your life and the people you have in it. It shows how a dad and son develop a relationship and how the son matures into a young man. His father does everything he can to try to make his son help him build this house. The father wanted to build a memory with his son. I love how building this house brings not only the father and son closer, but the son's mom comes back into the picture to help as well.
 Although this movie was great I did not like that the dad failed to mention he had cancer until the end, so the family could appreciate every minute with him. You should not wait till the last minute to do something in your life, which you want to do. Life is far too precious to waste years of wanting to do something and not doing it. Another thing I did not like was that it took the mom to realize she fell back in love with her ex husband till he told her he had cancer. The one thing that made me the most mad was the fact that one neighbor was complaining about the house being built, when the dad had only so much time to live and this house was his dream.
 I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves a romantic story. It has a lot of life lessons through this film.",1382227200,,1258,4.048192771084337
1679443,5,B00005YUSL,"This, what I call an ""ensemble"" piece, was very strongly cast. It's easily a coming of age movie about father and son but is really so much more than that. When a movie like this grabs the heart strings, I've come to realize it's the music- both score and source music- that kicks it off; you know, the tender little piano themes and then here comes the strings, etc. I feel ""Life As A House' does the best job of this and is the movie that introduced me to the favored work of Mark Isham- easily one of the best movie scorers ever IMHO. He paints in sensitive shades of emotion and landscapes of the heart that- singularly- make this worth the price of admission. I highly recommend it, but you might want to have a crying towel on hand. Obviously the actor performances and character development are central to the experience and storyline, and there is more top notch acting from too numerous to mention cast than I can mention here.

Kevin Kline broke my heart, Jena Malone stole my attention and Hayden Christensen just blew me away.  Besides, Kristen Scott-Thomas can do no wrong; seriously.  That said, this is one of those films that hasn't aged very well and upon recent viewings and reflection, the film has so many lows that counterbalance its true highs.  The emotional impact is somewhat manipulative, and not in that subtle way that is acceptable, forgivable and wholly encouraged.  The actually character development lacks some depth, instead shooting for obvious and superficial construction.  The metaphorical aspect of the film (the reconstruction of the house representing the reconstruction of his fractured family) had promise, and at times achieves what it sets after, but overall it feels roughly established and more of a gimmick than anything else.  Still, the acting across the board is stellar, especially Christensen who was a true flash in the pan (I worshiped him on `Higher Ground' and thought that he should have been nominated for the Oscar for this role; and still do).  Kline has a wonderful way of internalizing his emotions, which helps add layers of subtlety needed to glue us to his character.  Scott-Thomas is amazing and even Malone gives a nicely realized performance.  Still, the script is messy and the overall effect isn't quite what I remembered it being.  I like this movie, but the love has faded for me.  I can understand why so many adore it (it is constructed in a way that elicits a tearful reaction) but something about this film feels less than honest, and that isn't something I appreciate now that I'm older.",1312502400,,1762,4.91554054054054

1679580,4,B00005YUSL,"2001's Life as a House is a family drama about many things. It's about trying to cope with death. It's about trying to save your family. It's about trying to leave a mark on this world before you leave it. But ultimately, it's about humanity and the ties between family members that are the strongest when they're being tested.

George Monroe (Kevin Kline) is a talented architect whose life is falling apart. He just got fired from his job for lack of productivity, the lack of productivity likely being a result of the fact that he is dying from cancer. He is also divorced and has a son, Sam (Hayden Christenson), with ex-wife Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas).

Sam is your typical rebellious teenager, and Robin and her new husband can no longer stand Sam's behavior. Sam is on drugs, dyes his hair blue, and listens to Marilyn Manson, (which is probably the only thing about this film that truly bugged me, the fact that it nourishes the stereotype that these actions are standard for a troubled teen).

George decides that it's time to fix the mess he has made of his life before it's too late, so he offers to take Sam, who lives with his mother, for the summer so that Sam can help George work on the latter's house, which George intends to tear down and re-build.  But, of course, the disturbed teen is too absorbed in his goth style to think about anyone else but himself.  Cue whiny temper tantrum that makes Sam seem about ten years younger than he is.

At first, the project isn't as therapeutic for Sam as George would hope, since Sam insists on acting out, even getting involved with a pimp (Ian Somerhalder) in an attempt to score more drugs. It isn't until George's neighbor's (Mary Steenburgen) daughter (Jena Malone) aggressively pursues a relationship with Sam that he makes the decision to ditch the drugs and to start appreciating those who care for him.

Okay, I take it back - the whole Sam story arch bugs me.  This too perpetuates the stereotype that an addict is only taking drugs to get back at his parents and that he can't see or appreciate those around him who love him.  It goes without saying that many addicts realize that they are deeply cared for, and that it pains them greatly to continue to hurt the ones they love, but the addiction is often too strong to kick simply because they want to.  Here, you almost feel like Sam is making the ""mature choice"" to ditch the drugs, which is wholeheartedly inaccurate.

Anyway, rant over.  Back to the plot.  So despite meeting obstacles at every turn, like spiteful neighbors and petitions to shut his project down, George and his crew continue to work on this house, which can be seen as symbolic in that George is getting his life in order.  Though, it's also sad, because once that project is fixed, or complete, so is George's life.  Soon, everyone is inspired to help George achieve his goal.  Unfortunately, none of them realize George's ulterior motive until it's too late.

Despite the aggravation I felt for the Sam story arch, the tale that's told here is one we've seen before, but its execution is touching.  While the vanilla soundtrack surely wouldn't feature Manson (because his music is obviously only enjoyed by those who are mere seconds away from slitting their wrists), the songs by Joni Mitchell (""Both Sides Now"") and Guster (""Rainy Day"") that are included can surely change your life.

Unlike many other films that deal with cancer, there is very little spotlight on George's sickness itself, so if you're a hypochondriac like me, this film is relatively safe in that you won't be obsessively looking up your non-existent symptoms on WebMD after viewing it.  Also appreciable is that the film doesn't milk George's illness to make for a more depressing drama; it is only brought up when the need calls for mentioning it. Life as a House sets out to prove that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to, as long as you have a little tenacity, a lot of support, and a concrete goal.",1253145600,,3986,4.642958748221906

It is about family, the value of life, the quality of life, correcting the past, facing the future, breaking down barriers, showing love and accepting love (which is often the hardest thing to do), all symbolized through the the building of a house.  Fathers, sons, mothers, daughters all bravely striving for love and redemption under time limited circumstances.

Although the film is heavy in its emotional themes, it triumphantly uplifts and focuses on the things we should appreciate as human beings. This film is in no way contrite.  It is raw in its portrayal of vulnerability.  You will never forget this movie.

The cast is superb.  Kevin Kline is amazing as is Hayden Christensen.

This is a real gem, a movie of depth and meaning.",1244937600,,826,4.835714285714285
1679583,5,B00005YUSL,"If you're not afraid to cry, this may be the film for you.  I've read a number of positive and negative reviews of the movie and they seem to be split along the lines of those who can get into the emotions of the characters and those who stand back and judge the events as sappy.  It might be interesting to know the ages and sexes of the reviewers.

Count me in as one who loved the film.  I am a big fan of Kevin Kline.  I've never seen him give a bad performance.  Here he shines, once again, as a troubled fellow, George, whose life was given a bad start by his abusive father.  He has managed to hold down a job as a model-builder in an architect's office for twenty years but admits that he has hated every moment of it.  He seems to be a failure all over the place.  His marriage broke up ten years earlier; his beautiful wife Robin,(Kristen Scott Thomas) has moved on to a life of luxury with another man and two more children.  Sam, the son they had together is a drugged out teen who makes life miserable for everyone around him; even his mother can't stand him.  George's condition is perfectly symbolized by his unpainted shack of a house, which is the eyesore of the beautiful Malibu neighborhood.

As life would have it, this depressing situation comes to a head one very bad day when George loses his job in the morning, and then collapses and hears that he only has a few months left to live.  But, in the spirit of the film ""sometimes good things come out of bad.""  At least George decides to make the most of his last months.  This takes the form, initially, of tearing down the shack and replacing it with something he would really like to build.  In the process, he re-esatablishes contact with Sam (beautifully played by Hayden Christensen), and Robin and the whole bunch which was dysfunctional in the extreme, come together in a more loving, meaningful way.

I admit that even I found the ending a little too much, but if the intention of the film is to show human redemption, then it succeeded admirably.  George has broken the effects of parental neglect by refusing to pass it on to his son. Then Sam makes amends for a terrible act that George's father committed years before.  It's a wonderful story, very well acted by all the principles and definitely worth seeing.  It is visually quite gorgeous too; sunny Southern California is looking its best.",1236211200,2,2378,4.448036951501154

I won't spoil the ending but it makes you smile and say ""YES! That was the right thing to do!"".  In the day of fluff and nonsense movies that are currently on the big screen, this movie should definitely have earned far more recognition than it did.  It will be on my movie shelf by the end of the week.",1210550400,,1080,4.409090909090909

1679591,4,B00005YUSL,"It's an okay film overall, especially if you watched it through.  Initially, the movie gave me a lot of wince.  It's not because Kevin Kline's character was going postal, nor Hayden Christensen played an emo doing what appeared to be auto-erotic asphyxia, or Jena Malone's character was totally a wh*re.  No, none of that, but it's because the script was flawed in term of characterization.

I can understand why George (Kevin Kline) gone postal, and why he actually endured 20-some years before he blew up.  Did he not think through the consequence of his action?  He doesn't strike me as a person who would bottle up his anger for decades.  No, in fact, we had seen him pee into the ocean.  This is not a reserve, introverted person.  He doesn't care a squat about what people think of him.

I don't like why Sam decided to suddenly shed his make-up (yes, Hayden was fabulous with eyeliners, eye shadow, lip stick).  I think the filmmakers want us to see the progress of his character from a rebel to a daddy's boy....  Nevertheless, that was on a questionable premise.  Does putting make up on makes him an awful person?  Granted, maybe he did all that for the shock effect, because he wanted to be a rebel, but I never believe he was ever a ""bad boy"" at all, or at least the script does not set me up to become a believer of that.

There are a lot of stuff in this film that made me want to ask how can everyone tolerate George's self-pity for so long?  It's nice he built a house before he died, to fulfill his dream.  That's all fine, but I do not like the motivation behind it.  This is ""Life as a House"", not ""Me as a Planet"".

In term of direction, the director mentioned he wanted to make a film that examine what's going on in our society today.  If that's the direction, I have to say he was looking at our society in a rather conservative scope (and I am a conservative).  The kind a parent would condemn their kid with.  I do not believe the movie made a good point on ""what can be done"", instead, it judged, ""this is dysfunctional.""

I do like the house though.  It looks comfy and spacious.  :-)  The people behind the scene put a lot of effort into it, and I do like the analogy.  Life /is/ like a house.  The house analogy reminds me of ""House of Sand and Fog.""  (which is a very good movie)

Overall it's a good film, but it's flawed.  I may be a little harsh, but if what I mentioned (i.e., inconsistency of character; judgmental) got sorted out, it'll be a five-star movie.",1203984000,,2494,4.333333333333333
1679592,5,B00005YUSL,"My parents used to tell me ""build your house on a rock!"" I never quite get it... And then what? I watched this one movie and it made sense to me? My goodness...
This movie is about a guy whos life didn't go very well. His wife left him and his son is a drug addict. On top of all of that, he has about 3 to 4 months to live and then he dies. What is he going to do? He desides to build a house! I loved the part where he comes to get his son Sam to live with him for the summer while he is building the home. It was great to watch a father relating to his son in a new, tender, but forceful way, knowing that he only has about 3 months to do anything to help Sam's change his life!
Over the course of the house building, the father was able to establish a relationship with Sam, even though it was difficult and at time painful, since Sam was in such a bad shape in his soul. Made me wanna change my perspective about people in my family who are struggling with issues simmular to Sam's.

1679605,5,B00005YUSL,"There are lots of films involving a person's reflection on his own mortality. ""Life as a House"" is not as good as some, but holds its own in many ways. First is the glorious cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond, another feather in his many-feathered cap. The script also is better than many critics thought; I didn't see sappy moments, as much as I noticed renewal and re-growth of the human spirit. There was little pity involved, rather anger and confusion, more natural reactions I thought. Kevin Kline is in touch quite well, with fine insight about what needs to done. Kristin Scott Thomas finally has a role that is equal to her Oscar-nominated performance in ""The English Patient"", a renewed appreciation of things lost. The always excellent Jena Malone shines brightly as a new version of the hippie girl I used to know so well. And it's award winning Hayden Christensen who shows range, depth and redemption in this new found project with his father (and Malone). As he says in a DVD extra, doing ""Star Wars"" didn't involve as much preparation because everyone knew what those characters were about. Here, he is as complex as they get; a teen who knows everything but knows nothing (like most teens). His teen angst is well-examined, and presented quite well. (The SAG  thought so, too, as well as Kline.) There's plenty of humor to counteract the pathos. I enjoyed it a lot. Irwin Winkler has crafted a fine film. I few interesting DVD extras. I'm looking for another interesting performance from young Mr. Christensen. I hope the smart people can tap his resources for other fine performances.",1196553600,2,1601,4.843065693430657
1679606,5,B00005YUSL,"A Must-Watch

Life as a House is a terrific movie about the value of relationships and the unrelenting love that endures between family members despite how much they deny, suppress or dispute it.  It shows us what can happen should we decide to take the time to understand each other and revive bonds long neglected.  As we witness the reality of inevitably losing loved ones, it reminds us how fleeting and harsh life can sometimes be, and as we relate to similar experiences, the movie compels us to question our own lives and the human experience as a whole.

The story focuses on a father-son relationship.  Struggling with a terminal illness, the father strives to spend time with his hostile and withdrawn teenage boy.  The dad, a lonesome divorcee, hides his sickness as he desperately attempts to motivate his son to build a house with him.  The son, not believing in his father's abilities, expresses disdain for his seemingly inadequate father. I can't give away any more than that except that we also see the interaction between him and his ex-wife. I take the progression of their relationship as yet another opportunity in the movie to see that love never fades. Perhaps it only changes form? Like energy...

The set where most of the scenes take place is on a beautiful cliff-side overlooking the ocean.  This is the ocean where the father laughed in the waves holding his son when his was a little (favorite scene).  It's the same ocean where he spontaneously jumps off the cliff in to the sea to feel the rush of it all!

What do you do when you're divorced, you just got fired from the only job you've ever had, and your only son is slipping further and further away from you? You build a house. Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen star in this drama about finding yourself, love, and friendship. Kristen Scott Thomas, Jena Malone, Mary Steenburgen, and Ian Somerhalder are the perfect supporting cast for this critically acclaimed film, they really help bring it to life.

It's impossible to watch this movie and walk away without anything. Every time I watch it, I get something new. It could be perspective or just an idea.

Hayden's character Sam is a true depiction of what teenagers are like today, he's not some overly happy teen that loves his parents and respects authority. A lot of recent movies have been trying to pass this for the truth and I'm glad someone finally decided to change it. Sam is reluctant to spend the summer with his father (portrayed be Kevin Kline), but is it too late? Can he learn that there are some things in life that can't be changed? Is all love lost?

George (Kevin Kline) has had one too.  He's a forty-ish architech who's fallen out of touch with his estranged ex-wife and his children, most notably his teenage son.  Whats worse yet is that, upon realizing his failure as a parent, he finds out that he hasn't much time to make it better.  He's been diagnosed with cancer and his time is short.  George decides to get to know his son by building his dream home with him.  George's son (played BRILLIANTLY by newcomer Hayden Christensen, and if you'd seen Chistensen on the TV show Higher Ground then you already knew he could pull this off) is far from thrilled about the quality time he'll be spending with his father and is determined to get out of it, or at least make his father miserable during the process.  What's heartwrenching is that George hasn't told anyone about his condition, but once it's revield you can only imagine the heartache in store for the central charactors, including his ex-wife played by Kristin Scott Thomas.  Kevin Kline gives the performance of his career here, as does Christensen who plays the gothic loner prostitute with so much conviction you feel for him every second of this film.

1679649,4,B00005YUSL,"In Life as a House, Georges' tearing down and rebuilding of his house symbolizes his relationships as he completely changes Sam who begins to love his father, and Robin who falls back in love with George. On the other hand, as the house is being rebuilt, George starts to geel the effects of his cancer, and begins to die.

  My experience with this film is that I heard that it was a good movie, so I rented it, and watched it on September 27, 2005 at my house.

  At the beginning of this film, we see Sam as this one-sided, angsty teenager, who is on the wrong side of the track, dealing with everything fron drugs to small-time prostitution; yet as George takes Sam for the summer, wanting them to build a house together (with enormous opposition from Sam, mind you) we start to see a bond developing. On event is when George jumps off the cliff and into the ocean. At this point Sam has nothing but hate for his father, saying, ""you're totally insane"" and ""my father is a total wacko"". The major turning point in this film is when Sam flips out about George flushing his marijuana down the toilet. Sam starts screaming ""You never cared about me before"" (minus his bad French) and Georges' response of ""Well, now I do care"" really hits Sam. George pushes him down on the bed, and makes Sam listen to him, making him realize that he has to change. At this point, Sam himself realizes this, and helps George tear down the house, and their old relationship. We get his sense because the very next morning he wakes up early, and helps George with his house, where he would just lye around doing nothing before; he also is nice to his little brother and Mom for a change. Another aspect that gives us this change in Sam in his apperance; he no longer has his piercings, and has taken off all his makeup. When George finally tells him that he is dying, Sam flips out, starts crying and punching walls; this is a clear indication that he has made a one hundred and eighty degree turn from where he started, he actually cares about his father.

  Another relationship in question is that of Robin, George's ex-wife. Right from the start, we can definitely tell that they are exes; when George tries to touch Robin's fack, she attempts to bite his finger! How much more hatred do you need? Needless to say, there is a definite tension between the two. George happens to tell Robin that she is the most beautiful person he has ever met, and she's shocked jand outraged by this statement. I think this is the moment in the film where she starts doubting her relationship with both George and Peter (her current husband). One evening, when Peter is eating a dinner that Robin fixed for him, she asks him if he thinks it's odd that his kids don't hug him. We can certainly tell by this that she doubts him as a father. She visits Sam the first day he's at Georges', and she comes back the next day, and the next, and the one after that, as well as the next and tomorrow too. She helps George tear down the walls, and brings her kids (that she had with Peter, not George) to help, as well as lunch for weeks. Peter has a talk with Robin about maybe them taking a vacation sometime, but she tells him that she can't because she needs to help George with his house (not in those frank of terms, though); Peter realizes then that Robin doesen't love him anymore. The next day, Robin videotapes the construction, which shows us that she wants to develop her relationship further with George, and she even dances with him. When Peter leaves Robin, she tells George (in a way) that she still loves him, while he as well loves her back. There is tension between the two though, because George tells her that love is not enough, ans when Peter tries to get Robin back, we can tell that she wants to be with George nonetheless.

  On the other hand, while Georges' relationships are being built up simultaneously with his house, he is being torn down with his terminal cancer. This is being played up the most when Sam states that George looks like crap lately, and George responds with 'you're looking better than ever'; this just seems ironic how just when Sam is getter ""better"" in a sense, that George would be dying, and not be able to be with the new Sam for much longer. One's bar of life, so to speak, is being raised while the other is being lessened. Throughout the construction process, George starts to feel the effects of his cancer; he's taking more and more pills, sleeping in the middle of the day and looking pale and sickly. It seems to be as though it is a sort of re-birth, with Sam and George in the end. George dies, but Sam lives on in the spirit of George.

  We never find out how other people react to Sam's change, and I think that would be interesting to know; maybe we can hope for a sequel.",1134345600,,4801,4.3968432919954905

That phrase, said by George, the main character of this movie, is in my opinion a good introduction to a review about ""Life a house"".

George (Kevin Kline) is a divorced architect who is sacked from a job he hated. Immediately after that, he collapses and is taken to a hospital, where he gets bad news: he is going to die in a few months. George has to come to terms with the fact that he has terminal cancer, and only some months left to live. Wanting to make the best of it, George decides to build the house he always wanted to have, and get to know better his 16 year-old son son Sam (Hayden Christensen), who lives with his ex-wife, Robin (Kristin Scott-Thomas).

Robin is now married to a successful man, and has new sons, but doesn't relate well to her older son, who is highly problematic, uses drugs, and has a very negative attitude towards everything. That is probably the reason why she allows Sam to live with George during his summer holidays. Things won't be easy between George and Sam, though, because Sam resents George for leaving him with his mother. Father and son don't have a strong relationship now, or rather they don't have any kind of relationship besides the biological one. That is something that George will try to change, as he and Sam tear down a shack that was willed to him by his father, and begin to build a new one.

Soon enough, building the house begins to be an affair of many more than two, as Robin, her kids, and some new friends that Sam makes start to help. As the house begins to take shape, the spectator almost sees old wounds closing, even as fights abound. But what will happen when Sam finds out about his father's illness?. See this movie, and find out... I think this film is worth your time, and that you don't regret watching it  :)

It is important to point out, however, that ""Life as a house"" is not adequate for children, as it contains some sexual scenes and strong language. Morever, it touches upon subjects as prostitution and drug abuse. Despite that, those characteristics fit the story, and aren't in the film just for the sake of it.

All in all, I believe that Irwin Winkler should be congratulated on having directed such a good movie. The cast was excellent, and you won't be able to do anything but immerse yourself in the movie, and in the story that ""Life as a house"" brings to you. In a word, outstanding.

1679686,5,B00005YUSL,"...I finally decided to watch Life as a House. I loved it! I almost let myself get scared off by other reviewers' mentions of drug abuse, autoerotic hanging scene, pimping out of young boys to homosexuals, etc. Yes, all of the above is in Life. But - it is all necessary to the movie. You are not supposed to love (or even LIKE) the characters as they are introduced in this movie. George, the cancer-striken father, is self-absorbed and insensitive. Sam, his drug-abusing son, is so filled with hate that it causes him to act out in ways that were really difficult for me to watch. The beauty of Life as a House is that you begin to care about the characters because they change and grow. I can't think of anyone in Hollywood better to play such difficult roles than Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen. It was so hard for me to feel sympathetic to Sam's character because of the choices he made, but Hayden Christensen's performance really brought me around by the end of the film. Instead of coasting by on his good looks like most young actors (Orlando Bloom, anyone?)Christensen always brings such a strength of character to his roles and I really respect him for that. All of the actors in this film really bring so much sincerity and honesty to their roles. I also recommend watching the featurette ""Building Character: Inside Life as a House"". It really gives you a feel for the movie as the director envisioned it. You also see a side of Kevin Kline, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Hayden Christensen that added so much to my enjoyment of the movie. This could have been such a cliche of a movie with the oft-seen themes of death, life, and reconciliation. But it was handled with such a deft touch by the director, writer, and the actors that it really comes off well. I enjoyed Life as a House very much, will almost certainly watch it again, and thank the other Amazon.com reviewers for both warning me and intriguing me about this great movie.",1117152000,25,1950,4.574285714285714

1679691,3,B00005YUSL,"This tearjerker movie is never hurried.  Everyone is given sufficient leeway to act & opportunity to improvise.  ""Life as a House"" is a metaphor of Kevin's character's life or everyone's life per se.  He lived in a weatherboard house for 25 years and he didn't have any motivation to give it any TLC (tender loving care), to much the disgruntlement of the neighbourhood (upper middle class).  The house was gifted to him by his deceased father & naturally, their relationship was estranged.  He could never reconciled the demon inside him to the extent that his wife and his grown-up son distanced themselves away from him.  Thus, the formation of a dysfunctional family.  However, he would know soon after that he's only got a few months to live due to terminal cancer.  In that short span of time, he would like to live his life, that is to build his dream home, to reconcile yet again with his family.  Gradually, as the house gotten built, we would see the transformation of those characters gradually but definitely.  The ending is predictable but the performances are outstanding.  Physically, Kevin lost much weight to add credibility to the movie.  In the making of the movie, we would be told that certain scenes were cut as logistically, they couldn't include the old house in the frame as they had already moved on to the next scenes and beyond.  It's interesting to know about Hayden's passion in acting.  He commented that Star Wars wasn't difficult to do at all as all cast would need to fit within a limited regime (I guess to accommodate the special effects).  In this instance, he would need to dig inside his awareness to get empathy of the character he was playing.  There were many TV stars in this movie, namely, Scott Bakula of Quantum Leap's fame.  There were exaggerated and funny moments but what stuck in my mind would be modern society's complexity in relationships and the yearning of humans to reach out to one another.  Ultimately, isn't that what everyone is aspiring to, that is to be happy?  Highly recommended.",1094342400,6,2044,4.772079772079772

George has been told by his doctor that he is dying of cancer, and that he has three months left to live. This time period also happen to coincide with Sam's summer vacation. George wants to spend the last three months of his life, forming a relationship with his son, who he has barely spoken to in the last 13 years. George feels the best way for him to bond with Sam, is for them to build a house together, that Sam can live in after George has passed on.
Life as a House is one of the best films that I have ever seen. The film features an emotional story of a father and son getting to know each other, and eventually coming to love each other. Director Irvin Winkler and writer Mark Andrus came up with the perfect way for this to happen. Watching George and Sam work together on the house is great. The film also features a wonderful romantic element as well, because George and Robin manage to fall back in love after being seperated for so long.  This film is definately a tear jerker as well. I never cry when I watch movies, and this film even had me bawling my eyes out. Kevin Kline should have been nominated for an oscar for his role in this film. I feel that it is the best of his career. He accurately portrayed a man who is gradualy dying and who is estranged from his son. Hayden Christian and Kristin Scott Thomas did a wonderful job as well. The film also features other great actors such as Jena Malone, Mary Steenburgen, and Scott Bakula.

For those of you who are just now beginning to notice Mr. Christensen - for his work in SHATTERED GLASS - take a look here.  While SHATTERED GLASS is a great performance, in this earlier pre-STAR WARS performance, Mr. Christensen is called upon to go toe-to-toe with the great Kevin Kline.  Not many young actors could do this as well as he does here.  Mr. Kline gives it his all (as is his usual modus operandi) and thereby forces Mr. Christensen to do the same.

When he loses his job and discovers that he has terminal cancer, he decides to use the time he has left to confront the things in his life that have brought him the most pain and disappointment.  Kline keeps what is inevitably a tearjerker from being a dark and depressing movie and instead makes it a positive and uplifting experience with a type of somber comedy.
Telling no one of his condition, he sets out to tear down the ramshackle house left to him by his alcoholic father and build a new house fit for the prime location of a cliff overlooking the ocean.  He enlists for the summer the aid - or at least the presence - of his rebellious sixteen-year-old son Sam (Hayden Christensen) who, with blue hair and multiple facial piercings, has become an aerosol sniffing punk wishing death on his estranged parents.
Backed by superb supporting actors and actresses like Kristin Scott Thomas, Mary Steenburgen, Scott Bakula and Richard Cummings, Jr, this movie is the daydream of every parent with a rebellious teenager and of estranged ex-husbands still in love with their ex-wives.

This is unusual, because lately dramas bore the crap out of me... But not this one. The opening scene (with Kevin Kline's priceless ""performance"") endeared the film to me immediately - as did every bit of wit and crisis that followed. A friend recommended this movie to me, but in an offhand way so that I forgot about it entirely for about five months. Then my sisters rented it, and I was amazed at what I'd missed. (My sisters loved it too, by the way.)
I usually like Kevin Kline anyway, but the only other movie I'd seen Hayden Christensen in was that -awful- new Star Wars movie. (Come on, we can all admit now that it was terribly done.) I had no idea he was in 'Life As A House' until his face showed up on the screen - and even then I had trouble placing where I'd seen him before, since he looked and ACTED so differently. In other words, this time he did a marvelous job. I was impressed with the way he pulled off the whiny teenager bit so convincingly... and then changed so much towards the end of the film.
'Life As A House' is about relationships and their boundaries. As you go from one scene to another, you realize how representative of real life the film is; boundaries are hazy and they shift so often that it's hard to keep track of who you should hold close to your heart and who should be kept at arms length. The theme of death-in-the-family was something of a low blow, but it was the only believable way those particular people could have been brought together. In this instance, the cheap shot was the right one.
Film-making is an art; the whole point of art is to emphasize the things in life that you see as beautiful (or just powerful), so that others may appreciate that beauty. This movie showed the beauty a family exudes, despite the bitterness and hang-ups... And the power that family ties can have. I really enjoyed 'Life As A House' and I think you will too.

1679715,4,B00005YUSL,"Kevin Kline might be one of the most under appreciated actors in Hollywood today.  ""Life as a House"" is a fairly predictable film.  Kline's character George Malone has been been fired from his job, making models for an architectural firm, and been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  He has one summer left and he intends to use it tearing down the shack in which he lives and building a house.  He also demands that his son, Sam (Hayden Christensen), live with him in the garage while this is going on, instead of with his ex-wife, Robin (Kirsten Scott Thomas).  Sam is an angry young man, with blue hair, various body piercings a fondness for drugs, and a profound sense of self-loathing.  Will father and son reconcile before it is too late?  Will George and Robin rekindle their feelings for each other?  Will the house be built?  Do you really have to ask any of these questions?  You already know the answers.
But it is largely because of Kline's performance that you end up not minding about the film's predictability and the way things tend to neatly fall together.  Actually, the performances in this film are pretty good across the board.  The developing relationship between George and Robin is especially effective; I have never been especailly enamored of Thomas as an actress, but she and Kline have undeniable chemistry.  Even director Irvin Winkler was impressed by how much the pair added to the words on the page through their performances (he claims he never thought there was anything going on between the two characters until he saw the performances on screen).
Of course, George is not the only character in his family with problems.  Robin finds herself in a loveless marriage with cold fish Peter (Jamey Sheridan) and their rebellious son hates himself and everybody else.  George also has problems beyond the fact that he is dying as he, his dog, and his house are the subject of various complaints by his assorted neighbors.  George used to date his next-door neighbor Coleen (Mary Steenburgen), and now her daughter Alyssa (Jena Malone) has taken an interest in Sam.  Meanwhile, her boyfriend Josh (Ian Somerahlder), has a strange way of showing he is Sam's friend.  There are several surprises regarding these other characters, including a very realistic shower scene, but they are secondary to the main plot lines dealing with George's house, son, and ex-wife.
I do not want to dismiss this film as a mere tear-jerker, because ""Life as a House"" is more than that and the best scenes in the film are not those that make you reach for your tissues.  Kline is a master of gentle humor and uses his eyes as effectively as any actor working today.  This is not a classic film by any means, but it is very enjoyable and simply reinforces the idea that you can never go wrong watching a Kevin Kline movie.  He might not be as beloved as Tom Hanks, but he is every bit as good an actor (just do not ask me who Kevin Kline would be if Tom Hanks is the modern Jimmy Stewart).",1058659200,2,2991,4.680688336520077

I found the cast in ""Life as a House"" perfect for their parts; Hayden played the moody Sam so well, and somehow also managed to become the unimaginably altered young man with seemingly very little effort. The storyline was very believable: love can overcome anything.
There were grotesque parts of this movie, parts that some would prefer not to think about. However, they must be viewed in order to understand the complexity which makes this world up; none of the depressing, dark scenes were fiction.
My emotions changed remarkably during the time I spent watching this movie, and since I first rented it I went and purchased it, simply because I think it holds such potential to change the way people view the world, their lives, and those around them. It certainly had that power on me. I had never heard of it before I stumbled upon it at the movie store, but sometimes the movies praised the least are the best.

George's final wish is to build his dream house; and wants to make the most of this opportunity to bond with his family and put right the wrongs. Could the metaphors in ""building"" be made any more obvious by writer Mark Andrus? Thankfully LIFE AS A HOUSE is one of those rare movies where the sentiment actually works in its favor.
The script is intelligent and plausible, helped all round by the strong cast especially Christensen, who is excellent. Directed by Irwin Winkler (THE NET) and inspired by Akira Kurosawa's IKIRU, LIFE AS A HOUSE also co-stars Mary Steenbergen as Colleen, an older woman who seduces Sam; Jenna Malone as Alyssa, Sam's ""friend"" who seduces George (Crikey! Some guys have all the luck!); Jamey Sheridan and Scott Bakula. Sound complicated? It ought to wind up the Morals Brigade so that's always a good thing. Also intelligent Hollywood movies are becoming scarcer than hen's teeth nowadays, LIFE AS A HOUSE is recommended viewing for people with brains (Or half a brain-  like me! haha).
DVD extras include commentary by the Director, Producer and Writer; two featurettes ""Character Building"" and ""From The Ground Up"", deleted scenes, a press kit with general info and bios and the trailer.",1056326400,8,1589,4.885185185185185
1679739,4,B00005YUSL,"This is an interesting, thought provoking movie to watch in spite of its many problems that can destroy some of the ""logical"" pleasure of the movie, but indeed not the ""emotional"" pleasure.
Several things about the story are not totally comprehensible and many issues are glued together for the ""Hollywood sake"". First of all - the viewer or at least THIS viewer does not really understand what was SO bad in George's former life. George claims to have hated his work, working for 20 years in the same company and to have suffered all his life from living in an unwanted house.  Although we understand that George ""did not move up with times"" and did not learn how to use the computer, his job as an architect seemed to me to have been quite creative (at least from the models he formed) and basically not one of the worst jobs. His house indeed was not as fancy as the other houses in the street, however is located in an astounding place on top of a cliff with a beautiful view and seemed to be just the right house for a person sick of the modern life abuses. The movie starts with George waking up in the morning, urinating to the ocean and to me that was just the ""natural, free living"" George seemed to want to achieve. Or maybe, the house was hated because it was so full of bad memories? maybe that is the answer.
The viewer is also unable to understand what made George neglect his growing beloved son. Is this the first time George notices the stress signs his son is throwing out to the world? What happened in the last 10 years? All these questions are not fully answered.  The metaphor is supposed to be ""You are what you live in"" - which again seems incomprehensible to me. After all, to the end of the movie, George builds a beautiful house, but one that is as nouveu riche as all the other houses around - OK, maybe a prettier one...but still, a house that seems quite expensive. I guess we are supposed to appreciate that one has to follow his dream and to regret the fact that one (George) needs to wait to the end of their days to fulfill his dreams. Also, that building with your hands is always better then having something ready for you.... It is clear that a shock in one's life makes you realize what's important and too bad you did not see this before. Indeed all these messages do come through but they are somewhat shoved in your face...
Another serious problem is the producers need to squeeze all possible problems (and their solutions!) to one movie. We not only have a dying man building his house (achieved!) but also a divorce in the past, understanding your past mistakes, a history of a bad father son relationship with traumatic memories (solved!) and a drug problem (solved!). Many other reviewers have written about the ""Hollywood"" effect of the sex scenes. I thought the movie is quite Hollywoodish (did you notice how the problem with the neighbor is quickly solved?) but not because of the sex scenes. I actually thought that the sex scenes were only hinted. It is true that the movie deals with a lot of sexual issues but I am not going to close my eyes and pretend they do not exist in our world. Also, no body parts are shown and I felt that the bath scenes were quite innocent and dealt with the searching and getting to know teenage sex. George's relationship with his ex wife was very tender and heartbreaking.  In spite of all I wrote above I did enjoy the viewing and the acting of the wonderful Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott-Thomas.",1056240000,,3482,4.463108320251178

Although the overall plot was amazing, I could not help but be sidetracked by some of the ridiculously soap-opera-esque sub-plots. Overall a very nice movie, although a little over-the-top with sub-plots, which seem to be an unneeded attempt to keep the viewer satisfied.",1043625600,2,653,5.349514563106796

Scenes relating to the main character's battle with cancer are kept to a minimum in this movie; and, instead, this length of celluloid comes off as a brillliant celebration of life and the aspects of life that are really important.
  Kevin Kline plays an architect, who, after being dismissed from a twenty-year position at his firm, learns he is terminally ill.  Using his severence pay and cashing in his life insurance policy, he sets out to build his dream house; and in the process, he begins to rebuild lives that were shattered ten years earlier by his divorce.

'My Life As A House' comprises a selection of odd characters who end up helping a dying man build a house he should have built many years before.  By the end of the movie, I cared no more for this character or his ""wayward son come good"".  The characters just didn't have enough spark to make me feel any compassion for them.
I realise that reviews will discuss the special meanings of this movie - such as the importance of family, the need to follow your dreams, good health etc etc, but you will be none the wiser after watching this typical American family crisis movie.

This movie also displays the well rocognized talents of Kristen Scott Thomas and Kevin Klein.  The story is both dark and touching but always intriguing.  The only part that could have improved is the story behind why Sam is so destraught.  Likewise, Sam's transition was much too abrupt.  He suddenly wants to help his father, doest't hate his mother, and takes out all his piercings.  However, this is only a minor flaw and should probably just be overlooked as this is one of the best dramatic movies I  have seen in quite a long time.",1041724800,,798,4.65

1679758,5,B00005YUSL,"""Life As A House"" is the brilliant and inspiring film directed by Irwin Winkler and written by Mark Andrus.
PLOT SUMMARY: George Monroe (Kevin Kline) is a divorced man around his mid-fourties who has just learned that he is dying from cancer. His relationship with his rebellious, strained teenage son, Sam (Hayden Christensen) is, if anything, invisible. Sam lives with George's ex-wife, Robin Kimball (Kristin Scott Thomas), who married another man. When George insists that Sam spend the summer with him in his shack-of-a-home, which is actually a garage, Sam thinks his life is over. George decides to rebuild his runt-down house in the time that he has left to live. As he builds the house with his family, George starts to learn more about his family as Sam starts to learn about life. Also helping out is a neighbor, Alyssa Beck (Jena Malone), who grows close to Sam.
MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I thought ""Life As A House"" was a wonderful film. The acting performances were truly superb and could only make the film better and more enjoyable. Stand-out performances include Kline and Christensen--two extremely talented actors with great father/son on-screen chemistry. There wasn't much in the way of special effects, because it's a more drama, but the screenplay was well-written and the characters were well developed. The storyline was excellent, too. This film is filled with emotions--from the confused, rebellion of Sam, to the sadness that George will eventually die. What's interesting about this film is to see how George reconnects with his family after being away from them for so long.
The DVD extras are a plus to ""Life As A House"". The bonus material include deleted scenes, two original documentaries, theatrical press kit (which include cast and crew biographies), DVD-ROM extras, theatrical trailer, and more. The DVD is available in wide screen format.
I highly recommend ""Life As A House"".

I caught the last 15 minutes of it and caught the entire movie when it was replayed three hours later on the west coast feed.  The only complaint that I have is that the whole movie was set up right from the beginning.  Maybe this was just to keep the movie at about two hours.  We knew everything we had to know in the first half hour.  It was predictable, but it has some fantastic acting in it.

1679763,5,B00005YUSL,"Kevin Kline does an amazing acting performance in this drama that reminds you to live every day to its fullest for you never know how much time you have.  Kline lives his hum-drum life divorced from Kristin Scott-Thomas and estranged from his wild, and usually ...up, 16 year old son Hayden Christensen (from Star Wars).  When Kline gets fired from his job he collapses outside the building and finds himself in a hospital with only a few months to live due to cancer.  Without telling his ex-wife or son he decides to turn his shack of a house into the house he always wanted over the summer with the reluctant help of his son.  As the project ensues, and as he eventually becomes sicker, the house project becomes a family project.  This movie will leave you with hope, as much as it is sad, it is uplifting.  It's about fathers and sons, husbands and wives, friendships, and just learning to live with one another.  The ending is one of the most joyous endings I've come across in a movie lately.

1679764,4,B00005YUSL,"When ""Life As A House"" was first released I wanted to see it, despite the fact it opened to mixed reviews. Many people say the movie is a sappy tearjerker. That it tries too hard to grab our emotions. This all very well may be true, but, after I saw this film, I thought it was wonderful. And, I even thought it was one of the better movies made in 2001. But, I sort of forgot about this movie since I saw it. Untill last night when I just happened to see it on tv.
 ""Life As A House"" really is a great movie. Yes, I too can see the film's ""flaws"". But, the thing that gets me about this movie is how well done it is. The performances, escpecially by Kevin Klein (Who after I first saw this, I thought deserved an Oscar nomination) as a dying father. No one in this film seems to be ""playing it up"". No one is acting like a ham. I love the delicate touch the actors give the movie. ""Life As A House"" has so much heart to it, that I just can't find myself resisting the movie. But, besides acting and heart, the movie has other strong points. There are some very nice visual shot by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. And at moments the movie has good dialogue.
 The story-line to the film may sound a bit confusing, but, I'll try to explain it as best as possible. George Monroe (Kevin Klein) plays an architect, who has hated the last 11 years of his life. He has a breakdown in his office and is fired as a result. He is then told he has cancer. One of his life long dreams was to build a ""perfect"" house. He nows sees this as the perfect time for him and his son, Sam (Hayden Christensen, in a role that drew much critical attention his way) to spend some time together and get to know one another. See, George was once married to Robin (Kirstin Scott Thomas) and they had Sam, but since the divorce, Robin has married Peter (Jamey Sheridan). And either one of them gets along with Sam, who locks himself in his room, does drugs, has piercings, and listens to loud music.
 ""Life As A House"" does throw in some things that aren't really necessary. Like a sub-plot concerning one of George's neighbor's as his ex-girlfriend, played by Mary Steenburgen. And now her daughter, Alyssa (Jene Malone) likes Sam. This doesn't really do anything for the story itself. And I guess certain things were thrown in for a comic relief, like the fact that almost everyone in the neighborhood, thinks George is crazy. But, over-all the effect of the movie works.
 Some may see this movie as a rip off of ""American Beauty"", I can see how and why someone might think that, but I don't completely agree. I think this film is trying to do it's own thing. Plus, I think ""Beauty"" is a better film anyway lol. Certain things in this movie may seem obvious and you will be able to tell what will happen, but, it's what takes place inbetween those moments that makes ""Life As A House"" work.
 A lot of people dislike this movie because they said it's trying to be too many things at once. It has the human element needed to be a drama, it has funny moments, and has romance. Well, to these people I just say, at that what life itself is filled with? ""Life As A House"" wants to be one of those kinds of movies that ""gets life on screen"". It wants to be comprised of the things that we all go through. Granted, we all may not exactly led the same lives these characters lead, but, I think everyone gets the point I'm trying to make. So despite it's flaws, ""Life As A House"" is a movie I hope everyone who sees it enjoys.
 Bottom-line: An effective well done ""tearjerker"" that has wonderful performance, fine directing, and some beautiful dialogue. A movie about life!",1034553600,,3639,4.312865497076023

1679797,5,B00005YUSL,"Kevin Kline plays the lead character in this outstanding movie about life, love and families.  Kevin's character gets fired and later that day finds out he has terminal cancer.  In the mean time his son (Hayden Christensen) is in an emotional void, drifting away from his mother and siblings.  Kristen Scott-Thomas plays the exwife who is remarried and unhappy with her new husband's lack of emotional support, even though he is rich, which shows money can not buy love.  So Dad and son move in together for the summer.  To destroy the old house, and memories, and create a new house and hope for the future.
The story line is somewhat predictible but the acting is superb.  With great performances by all including Scott Bakula, Hayden Christensen, Kristen Scott-Thomas.  The top performances, in my opinion, go to Kevin Kline, Jena Malone and Hayden Christensen.  Jena plays the girl next door who had hoped her mother would marry Kevin's character and he would then become her father.  Hayden Christensen does a fine job with the transformation his character must go through, from an emotional void to a caring person.  From a trouble teen, to a fine young man.
I have heard folks compare this movie to a soap opera.  There is a lot of subplots and supporting character interactions in the movie and it moves along just fine, keeping you very interested.

I dare say that many men who watch this film could easily spot themselves in either of the two male leads.  Hayden Christenen proved in ""Attack of the Clones"" that he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, but in ""...House"" he did somewhat better.  The rest of the cast is first-rate.
The basic story borders on being a TV movie-of-the-week, but its gentle execution elevates it well above that.
Watch the two behind-the-scenes docs and be amazed to learn that, with the exception of the house Kline's character is building, all those beautiful Malibu homes were actually just facades.",1027814400,,710,4.709677419354839

1679804,3,B00005YUSL,"""Life as a House"" is a film that divides opinions among people.  Critics would find faults with the entire film, rightly pointing out predictable story of the film.  But non-critic audience, not least those fans with taste for tearjerkers, would definitely love it, simply because of what it is -- its story.  But that is no surprise, considering Irwin Winkler's past record as director -- not-so-suspenceful ""The Net"" comes to my mind first -- but most of all, as you know, as producer he once made a very popular film called ""Rocky,"" and though Sly didn't win the bout, you knew you would cry in the end while watchinghis fight with Apollo.
In a nutshell, this is a story about family.  Kevin Kline is living alone in a dirty, old house until one day he knows that his life is not long, so visits his long-estranged son Hayden Christensen and ex-wife Kristin Scott Thomas, proposing to re-build his house during the summer.  Hayden naturally dislikes his dad who long neglected him, or everything around him, but reluctantly comes to live with him (partly because in the neighborhood he finds a beautiful girl Jena Malone), helping rebuild the house, or his own life.  The story gradually leads you to the obvious conclusion, re-union of family (or psuedo-family) members surrounding Kevin Kline.
The film goes on a path which has been already known by other past masterpieces like ""Terms of Endearment.""  Those who have seen this Jack Nicolson - Shirley McLaine film can claim that similarity between this and ""Life as a House"" (jumping into the ocean, unexpected love, and death by disease, etc.) and also the weakness of the latter, which is, the lack of emotional power coming from smooth storytelling.  Though ""Life as a House"" has its moment, especially between Kline and Scott Thomas, we can have an impression that some other episodes look either forced and labored, or too simple and obvious.  Mary Steenburgen's character has a love affair with a boy in a too unbelievable way, unnecessarily trying to make a certain scene very comical, and Kline's bickering neighbor attempts to sue him in an most awkward moment, when his family's emotional bond should be given more close-up descriptions.  Or Christensen, though himself good, is reduced to a hackneyed image of troubled teen who locks up himself in the room, listening Marylin Manson on stereo with loud volume.  Unoriginal, isn't it?  Director Winkler does have good ingredints, but he doens't seem to know how to cook and  arrange them.
The whole film as a consequence relies on actors' superb performance, and the result is not bad.  Actually, Kevin Kilne is so crebible as an ailing architect that you will forget that the script is not so original for all its good intention.  Also Chrisenten is good, showing that he anyway didn't need the role of Anakin to be recognized.  But as a moviegoer who have seen so many Hollywood films, I can say that I have seen the story before, and in a better way.  Sorry.",1027296000,4,2977,4.828740157480315
1679815,4,B00005YUSL,"I've yet to see Kevin Klein turn in a bad performance and he carries this one off very nicely. A fundamentally simple story of disaffected people, father and son, who come together to build a house. The script works hard to stay away from hokey sentimentality and succeeds; it's less successful when it tries too hard to be amusing, particularly with the snotty neighbor who's at war with Klein's dog and the silly sidebar of Mary Steenburgen's affair with a young male friend of her daughter's. Hayden Christensen is absolutely wonderful as the pill-taking, pot-smoking, angry and alienated son. Not only is he a beautiful young man, he's also a powerful actor who's completely convincing as Klein's son. Jena Malone has grown up to be a good actress, one who looks real--as if she might actually be the daughter of Klein's next-door neighbor. The usually icy Kristin Scott Thomas is warm and unpredictable as Kevin's former wife.
The film moves into Capra feel-good territory with everyone and his brother coming along to help finish building the house--which is such a wonderful-looking place that people would be lining up to live in it. The early scenes between Klein and Christensen are just terrific and it's a shame that this level of truthful intensity isn't sustained throughout the film.

Sam(Christensen) is a troubled teen who's being forced by his dad(Kevin Kline) to help him build a house, and in the process rebuild their troubled relationship. The movie is indeed very touching, and Kline and Christensen have excellent chemistry with their performances. Granted it's not a great film because of its content, but still it is very touching, and uplifting. Congradulations on your performance with this movie Hayden.

George Monroe has given up on life.  He lives a life he hates, works at a job he can't stand, and lives in a house he's never wanted.  He has a son that hates him.  Just when he thinks things can't get worse, he loses the job he hates and is diagnosed with cancer.  Now, all George wants is to make his life mean something.  He moves his drug-addicted, mad-at-the-world son into his ramshackle home for the summer.  He throws himself into building the house of his dreams and straightening out his son's life by giving him what his own father never could - love.

The movie was quite poignant without being clichd and was able to evoke real emotion without yanking too hard at the ol' heartstrings.
Having actually lived through what Hayden Christensen is going through with a beloved family member of my own, it is easy to find common ground with the film.  That aside, Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott Thomas were excellent as usual and their tattered love affair seemed very tangible and melancholy.

I'm astonished that this movie got such positive feedback and get offended when people say it is nearly as good as ""A Walk To Remember."" They are both redemption stories, that is true, but there is a galaxy of difference between the two movies. In this regard, ""Life as a House"" it is neither soup nor wet bread, as we say in Italy; therefore, it fails to accomplish its very purpose. Let me explain; I got the movie because the back cover said it was a story about redemption and renovation. Now, if viewers want to watch this kind of movie, it is because they like redemption stories, right? If they like redemption stories, it means that they care (at least a bit) about morality, right? Otherwise, why care about redemption, redemption from what? Do you see my point? Good. Then, why in the world would you present a (completely unnecessary) subplot with the mother of the female protagonist engaging in a ... relationship with a teenage friend ... of her daughter's? What is even worse, why would you not present it in a negative way, but, on the contrary, with a lighthearted approach as if you were showing a funny scene from ""Friends?"" Don't you realize that this fact alone was fatal and totally bombed the entire movie? At least, in ""The Devil's Advocate,"" Charlize Theron was able to see that all the ""nice"" people she was surrounded by, behind all their nice appearance and all, were demons of the worst species. But this movie is horrid in its subtlety. It wraps the whole thing in a nice package of rich people living in Orange county with nice homes and fancy cars and at the end, presents the mother as a generous person that helps the protagonist build his house. What a nice lady... Gimme a break. I do not want to mention other morally offensive aspects of the plot, but take my word on it; if you care a bit about morality, do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.",1025654400,5,1899,4.507246376811594

Then I simply couldn't wait to see more of his work, and was reminded of LaaH.
It blew me away. Without a doubt this movie is on my top ten favorites. Kevin Kline delivers nothing less than you would expect, and a little more.

Kristin Scott Smith is always delightful, and I found it hard to believe that this was Hayden's first big picture.

Sam's mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) is at her wits end with her drug using, angst ridden son and agrees to let him stay the summer with his father. While tearing down his old, shack of house (that clearly annoys the neighbors) Kline's character,George, tries to reach out to his son and work through years of neglect that he regrets.  Clearly, as he tears down the walls of his old house, he begins to tear down the walls of hurt that his son feels. The rest of the story revolves around the building of the house, involving neighbors---Mary Steenburgen and Jenna Malone, as a mother and daughter who live next door and Scott Bakula, as a good hearted police man.  Kline gives a very good performance as does Scott Thomas.  The chemistry between the two is very good.  Hayden Christensen shows us that he should have more acting in him once his stint as Darth Vader is over.  He was very good as a trouble young man in this film.

1679864,5,B00005YUSL,"It seems that viewing a dysfunctional family always entertains. (Come on! The Ozzbournes?!) Maybe it's because it dreadfully reminds you of your own or maybe it's because it shows just how much better your family actually is. Anyway, this is what the movie's all about. It's about rebuilding and renovating the people around you. Becoming what you should've become later in life. Kind of the same concept of the long time cancelled television show Home Improvement. The message here is much more heartfelt.
 George (Kevin Kline), a man living in a dumpy old shack on the edge of a rocky shore, is fired from his hated job. Not only does he hate his job, he happens to hate his home as well. Actually he mentions hating many things. He soon decides to tear it down, and build something better. His ex-wife Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas) lives in a huge, modern home with her present husband and their kids. Sam, (Hayden Christensen),her blue-haired, 'thumbtack in chin' son from the previous marriage, feels nothing of himself. His first scene was perfect as an introduction to his character. The first thing he does when he gets up in the morning was hang himself in his closet. Unfortunately for him, it didn't quite work. What the deal is here, is how Robin doesn't really know how to discipline her 16-year-old son. She just let's him isolate himself and ignores his yelling.
 As summer begins, George decides to take Sam for the entire summer to aid in building the house. After a few funny moments between the somewhat strangered father and son, the bittersweet repairing of their family qualities begin. Just as in real life, in this movie, you'll have to take the good results with the unfair ones.
 With more strangely wonderful characters such as George's neighbors and Sam's drug dealing sidekick Josh, this movie gives more laughs than tears, and it gives you lots of tears. The highlight of this film would definitely be Hayden's impressive and captivating performance. Sam was so hardcore, but also very passionately sensitive. A beautiful character for a beautifully made movie.
note: This would be a perfect movie for family if it weren't for two brief sex scenes. Just for the overprotective parents to know.",1023148800,3,2222,4.888594164456234

This is a beautiful movie and the acting is incredible. I've always been a fan of Kevin Kline and his incredible versatility but he earns my respect and admiration in the role of George. A middle aged retrenched architect who has discovered he has little time to live. In an effort to make amends with his estranged son before his death he takes him for the summer in hopes that while building a house together they might also build a relationship.
Kline shines in this role, a very different role but worthy of recognition. His sarcastic, yet touching delivery creates a wonderful and relatable character that appeals to the senses. But the real star is Hayden Christensen. A bit of a dissapointment in star wars I adored him in this film. Perhaps the stifling role of the man who would become Darth Vader and the pressure of living up to Fan Expectations has diminished his ability to make the role his own. But there is no such stigma in house. His work is honest fresh and appealing. The raw emotion and hurt of his character is believable and heart breaking. I must confess to being in tears for at least an hour during this film. The absolute chemistry between Kline and Christensen and also Christensen and much matured Jena Malone makles this an enjoyable film for anyone and I highly recommend it.",1023062400,3,1476,4.61596958174905

Trouble is, it's just so damn endearing. Sure, the story unfolds with an easy predictability, and it's at least as emotionally manipulative as any other terminal illness film. But as the patient declines and his relationships recover, it's the light touch of the three lead actors who manage to pull this high-risk weepy back from the brink. Kevin Kline is perfectly unsentimental in a role which, on paper, must have been crying out for Kevin Spacey or Harrison Ford. But in the scenes that really mattered, Kline's warm and understated performance had me thanking God that neither of them got his part. Kristin Scott Thomas has never been more convincing. And Hayden Christensen proves definitively that his performance in 'Attack Of The Clones' was, like the rest of that film, an abomination for which we can blame George Lucas. (The kid had me crying in both movies - but for entirely different reasons!) This is easily the best film Irwin Winkler has directed, and Mark Andrus' script, despite some obvious flaws and occasional mawkishness, for my money still beats his overrated 'As Good As It Gets' hands down. There's something more honest and plausible at the heart of this one. It's very hard not to admire what the hero sets out to do, both literally and metaphorically: to tear down the legacy his father left him and create something better with his own son. With so many slick and cynical films out there, it's so nice to find one brave enough to tackle the difficult subject of male relationships, and to do so in such a surprisingly emotional way.",1022976000,2,1712,4.767676767676767

However, the performances of the actors, esp.

And maybe that's why, when we are confronted with it in a startlingly real form, it has the power to bring us to our knees. To bring us to tears. Hayden Christensen, in Life As a House, nearly brought me to both.
It wouldn't be accurate to say that Life As a House does anything entirely new. In some manner or another we have seen all of the elements present in this movie in some other film. But what makes it true, what makes it honest, is the presence of actors that care.
Kevin Kline is stunning in his portrayal of a man daunted by past mistakes because of the limits imposed on his future. At times his pain, his physical pain, is not convincing. That doesn't matter. Because he talks about his own father, he talks about all of the horrendous mistakes his own father made, and he can still say that he ""loved him too much."" I believe him, I understand, and in that moment I, too, care.
Christensen's character, a young man trying to find himself, his place, when he has no idea where to look, is remarkable. His transformation seems to take hold and progress rapidly. It's unrealistic. And it doesn't matter. Because, where once he couldn't tolerate the touch of another, he holds his father's hand. His arms come around his mother first and he holds her as though he is a child again. He grieved because he was beginning to understand his place, and I grieved for everything he lost and was willing to give up to hold onto it.

1679883,4,B00005YUSL,"Somebody once said that ""life"" is what happens when you're not looking.  And it's so true.  Too often we let the years slip by, and the important things slip right along with them; and it's only when something happens that we start to pay attention, and by then it's too late to do anything about it.  The good news, however, is that as long as you're still breathing there's still a chance to make amends, or at least try to.  You can try, not to make up for past mistakes (and we've all made them), but to make ""today"" count, which is what a man at a particular juncture in his life discovers and sets out to do, in ""Life As A House,"" directed by Irwin Winkler, and starring Kevin Kline.
 George Monroe (Kline) is an architect, a man who can design anything, with the exception of that which is the most important:  His own life.  He has a failed marriage-- now divorced for ten years from Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- a failed relationship with his now sixteen-year-old son, Sam (Hayden Christensen), he's getting on in years and he's unhappy, which is driven home by circumstances involving his job and his health that make him abruptly sit up and take notice.  His ""house,"" literally and figuratively, in not in order.  And he decides to do something about it.  He's determined to tear down his old house and rebuild a new one, and he begins by arranging for Sam to come and live with him for the summer.  And it will be a summer that will affect, not only George and Sam, but Robin, and a number of others, as well; a summer in which the trivial things of life are put on hold; and for once, the important things are embraced.
 Working from a well written and insightful screenplay (by Mark Andrus), Winkler delivers a drama that is thoughtful and poignant (at times, even poetic), wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond.  Rich in metaphor, it's an engrossing film that works on a number of levels, and will appeal to a wide audience-- many of whom will relate to George and his situation, others who will identify with Sam; and for some, it may hit strikingly too close to home.  Whatever your personal situation is, it will fall somewhere within the emotional arc Winkler creates here; and if it doesn't now, it will eventually.  Because, as this film so trenchantly points out, ""life"" happens.  And the most important thing is knowing what to do with it-- if not the first time around, then at least before it's too late.
 He received an Oscar for his portrayal of Otto in the comedy ""A Fish Called Wanda,"" but Kevin Kline decidedly hits his stride in dramatic roles:  As Nathan in ""Sophie's Choice,"" Mack in ""Grand Canyon"" or Ben in ""The Ice Storm,"" for example; and now here, as George Monroe.  Kline brings George believably to life, with a performance that hints at who George was, but most importantly tells us who he is now.  With understated subtly, he conveys his inner-most feelings in a way that enables the audience to make that all-important emotional connection with the character.  He makes you feel as though you know him; and once you do, and once you meet Robin, it's hard to understand what went wrong between them all those years ago.  One can only assume that somewhere along the line youth and a lack of focus took it's toll-- understandable in a world that bombards us daily with endless stimuli.  And it's one of the subtle perspectives that makes this film so effective.
 Kristin Scott Thomas gives a convincing performance, as well, as Robin, a woman who has moved on with her life, but in whom you can discern a certain dissatisfaction with her current situation.  On the surface, her life seems agreeable, but we see through her portrayal that it is still lacking in some regard.  She seems happy to some extent, but it's more like the unfulfilled happiness that comes when one has ""settled"" for something.  You get the sense that what she has with her current husband, Peter (Jamey Sheridan), is somehow less than what she had with George, at least at some point or other.  Thomas does a good job of indicating the complexities of her character, dipping beneath the surface to make what could have been a one-note character alive and interesting.
 One of the real rewards of this film, however, is found in the wonderfully affecting performance of young Hayden Christensen, as Sam.  With but a few TV appearances and a handful of unremarkable films to his credit (the exception being a part in Sophia Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides""), Christensen is virtually an unknown, but comes through with some extremely impressive work here.  He not only finds, but manages to convey, that turmoil of confusion and need for personal identity that every teenager experiences, and he presents it quite naturally and effectively.  There's nothing feigned or pretentious about him; the Sam he delivers comes from somewhere deep down inside, and working from the inside out makes him very real and believable.  It's a performance that should jump-start his career, which is about to be catapulted into high gear/high profile status when ""Star Wars:  Episode 2, Attack of the Clones"" hits the screen, in which he plays the role of Anakin Skywalker.  And because of the magnitude of that film and all that goes along with it, he will never receive the acclaim he deserves, no matter how good a job he does in it; so it's important that he has this film under his belt, which demonstrates what a truly gifted young actor he really is, a fact that may be overlooked once ""Clones"" hits (which is what happened to Leonardo DiCaprio after ""Titanic"").  And Christensen's performance here is a big part of what makes ""Life As A House"" a winner.",1021161600,110,5696,4.6894472361809045

Kevin Kline wonderfully portrays a man who sees the end of his life but wants to do all he can to make repairs before he departs. His way of doing this is to build a house to repair his relationship with his son and to get rid of his many unhappy memories associated with the old house on the cliff.
The movie had a great cast of actors who all played their roles to perfection. Sure, some of the plot twists were a bit ""out there"" or coincidental, but the whole film worked in spite of them. The terrific soundtrack only added to my overall enjoyment.
""Life as a House"" left me with lots to think about, which is always a good thing and to me is the mark of a good movie.",1020384000,3,837,4.109756097560975
1679887,2,B00005YUSL,"I was interested in seeing this movie when I heard that A) it had a soundtrack by the band Guster, an unpopular group I`ve loved for years, B) It had this hot actor in it that I saw in a teen magazine, and C) it made my friend cry harder than she`d cried in a long time. I was more than a little dissapointed, and I don`t think it was just that I was expecting too much. What we have here is a major wanna-be ""American Beauty""-even my sister and another reviewer on this page noticed the connections. Pointless sub-plots including the son Sam`s involvement with drugs, Sam`s more-than-a-friend interaction with Alyssa nextdoor, and her mother sleeping around with her friend Josh (And I still can`t figure out the point of that one.) The reason all that kind of stuff going on in American Beauty made it good was because the movie was so well-done and incredible that all the supposedly nasty details were more than forgiveable. You can`t just throw in some affairs and secret drug dealing and say ""Look, we`ve got another American Beauty!"" There were just too many similarities-Kline`s character that was too much like Lester and his continued narration afterhe dies at the end of the movie, the comic wacking-in-the-shower concept taken to a stupid level, and random nudity all over the place.
For the most part I thought the screenplay was horrible, with the big exception of some shining moments, such as when George tells his son that he`s dying, the scene that generally jerked out the most tears. The dialogue contains good, in-depth insight into concepts that didn`t need to be incorporated into the story, like George`s childhood with an abusive father which was extremely cliche.
I thought a large percent of the characters were badly casted. If Kline had to pretend to be Lester, he could have done a better job of seeming crazy in a loveable way like Kevin Spacey did. The way he did it just kind of clashed with the character the lines were asking for. I did, however, think that the actor of George`s son did a good job. His character goes from acting tough and untouchable to acting pathetic and clueless, in which he sometimes looked to me like a little puppy shivering in the rain. You could tell there were different sides to his character. I`m confident he`ll do well in the upcoming Star Wars movie, which might save the film from what`s-her-name`s undeveloped acting.
So bottom line, there are some good things in this movie, and I think the creators could have done better by just sticking to their own ideas, and if you`re not too picky like I am (though I usually am not picky about movies at all, I just had to turn my nose up at this one) you might actually like it a lot. It got other reviews that were good, and I suppose the good parts of it are worth a rental price.",1019865600,2,2796,4.5717131474103585

We laughed out loud throughout the movie because it is THAT BAD! I will admit that the acting is great. But the script is ridiculous. How can people say that they found it believable? How about when the angry neighbor turns out to be the solicitous, gay ""john""? How could the kid prove that? The guy would just deny it and continue with the lawsuit. Angry, litigious neighbors aren't scared of teenage boys with idle threats. Anybody knows this! Then there's the teenage girl that wants to shower with the boy but ""just be friends"". Yeah right! But the best part is the ending with what the boy decides to do with the house. It's worth it to rent the movie just to see how lame and ridiculous the ending is. My wife and I laughed so hard. I stood up and clapped and yelled at the tv ""Yes. That is the worst movie I've seen in my whole life!!!"" If you don't mind being spoon-fed every Hollywood clich imaginable, you'll love this movie.

1679891,4,B00005YUSL,"A classic drama, with all of the traditional elements designed to pull at your emotions!  It has been some time since one had the use of such a broad cast of talented actors.  This particular cast's ability to make the audience believe in their characters really makes the difference in this film.
Kevin Kline is in one of his best roles ever as the father who is given the chance to re-evaluate his life and family through the lens of his terminal illness.  Kristen Scott Thomas shines as Kline's ex-wife who realizes that her former husband really did care for her while they were married - and that his feelings have not changed.  Hayden Christensen brings incredible screen charisma and talent to his portrayal of Kline's disconnected son.  One can hope he is allowed to do the same with his role in the upcoming Star Wars: Attack of the Clones.
Watching Kline deal with his illness is, obviously, the main point of the film.  How he deals with it, from a touching scene with a nurse early in the film, to his method for reaching into the abyss that has swallowed his character's son allows Kline to really showcase his superb acting talent.  It is unfortunate that the Academy did not acknowledge his performance when making the nominations this year - he certainly was up to Oscar standards.
A fine ensemble cast rounds out the film, with such notables as Mary Steenburgen and Scott Bakula adding nice touches throughout.  Some interesting side stories keep the movie from bogging down, as some dramas often do.

The story of a divorced and dying man trying to reconnect with his rebellious son could have been destroyed by being overly maudlin, but this film was a tearjerker without being contrived.  This is what separates this film from others of its kind, and I think almost anyone can enjoy it.  All of the actors are great in this one, and the acting of Hayden Christiansen is wonderful.

This movie is centered around the last summer of a man who wants to spend that time rebuilding his ramshackle house.  Knowing he is sick, he enlists his goth son to stay with him and help for the summer, but Sam doesn't want to.  Instead he wants to spend the summer taking drugs and partying.
There is a lot of tension between father and son, but there are some humorous times too.  This one is very sad, but at the same time, its not so much about dying, but living life to the fullest with what little time you have.  Its also about family coming together in the face of a crisis, but there is a rocky time getting there.

I can't say that it hit a strong chord with me on the personal scale in my ability to relate to the characters or the action, but it did draw me in.
U.S. produced films of this nature are quite rare.  Why?  This is a character study.  Most U.S. films are attempts to score hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue by blowing things up and showing as much cleavage as possible, all the while cursing up a storm.  There is typically very little dialogue.  This is not the case with Life as a House.
Okay, so there's more than necessary cursing coming from the rebellious son - but somehow it doesn't seem to intrude too much on this film, because it struck me as typical of the kids that age.  And then there's the sex...It, too, is present, but it is a device not the plot.
The screenwriter(s) obviously knew what the heart and soul of this film should be and did their best to keep it as such.  The actors, in turn, cranked out some great performances.  They felt real.  It was actually nice to see realistically portrayed characters instead of the Hollywood version of the same.  This is definitely a California-centric film, but at least it doesn't assume that everyone watching it lives their lives in the same manner as the characters in the film.  It doesn't talk down to us.  It doesn't preach to us.  In the end, this is a film that really shows the transition from boyhood to manhood in a matter of months and in a way in which is totally believable.",1018224000,2,1590,4.306397306397306
1679899,4,B00005YUSL,"""Life as a House"" is pretty much everything you would expect from yet another addition to the tearjerker genre. There is a canvas filled with characters who deal with life changing situations and events that shape who they will become once the movie reaches a predictable, thoroughly unoriginal conclusion. We know from the start how it begins, how it ends, what happens, and who it happens to. And I must say, I've never seen the formula done quite so well.
The story introduces us into the dysfunctional life of George (Kevin Kline), a simple man with a not-so-simple issues plaguing him. His ex-wife of ten years, Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas), pleads with him to take their estranged son, Sam (Hayden Christensen), for the summer in hopes that the two will reconcile their differences, and that Sam will rid himself of the hatred for his family. His neighbors abhor his ramshackle house and unorthodox living conditions (the absence of indoor plumbing requires him to urinate outdoors). He has just lost his job of twenty years, and to top it all off, he now has a terminal illness.
From here, the movie fills its already intriguing canvas with various, continually involving subplots. Against his will, Sam goes to spend his summer vacation with his father, who has plans for building a new house where his shack stands, hoping that the experience will bring them closer together. Of course, the two bicker constantly, Sam shutting himself off, George making light of every situation.
Along the way, more characters come into play, and previously introduced characters make larger impressions. Sam makes a strange friend in Alyssa (Jena Malone), who sees fit to shower with him, but only wants to remain friends. Robin takes an interest in helping George in the construction of the house; we soon get the feeling that they harvest old feelings for one another, which throws a wrench into her present marriage.
All of this takes some pretty familiar twists and turns, adhering to the age-old formulas of father-and-son reconciliation, people finding rejuvenation through life changes, the healing of broken relationships and the creation of new obstacles that are easily overcome. The fact that we know George is dying is a plus, as it prevents the movie from using it as a startling revelation later in the film. It also gives the audience a choice: either succumb to the movie's predictability and familiarity, or flee.
Imagine my surprise when I found myself immensely enjoying the film. Throughout much of Irwin Winkler's respectable melodramatic web of intertwining stories, there are unique touches of jovial humor and real emotion played out by his brilliant cast, who elevate the movie to above-average standards. Kline's biting humor and zest for life are a life force for the film, while Christensen is extremely convincing as the rebellious Sam. These two gifted actors not only sell us on their characters, but make the routine reconciliation believable. Scott Thomas, Malone, and various other supporting actors bring out the best in each character, so that they quickly become people we can identify with and care for.
Your embracement of a film like ""Life as a House"" requires that you have a soft spot for the genre, and all its various devices. Having said that, this is a rare gem of a movie that made me laugh, almost made me cry, and gave me nothing more than an enjoyable two hours spent getting to know some very complex and inviting characters.

Wonderful, engaging performances by Kevin Kline, Kirsten Scott-Thomas and Hayden Christensen make it an enjoyable experience despite the overcrowded, mediocre screenplay, which often resorts to cheap and unnecessary tricks and clichs to tug on our emotions.

1679936,4,B00005YUSL,"I'm telling you Kevin Kline is one of the best actors we have today... And not a lot of people know that... This film even though you basically have it figured out when you hear or read about it is such a good film. Kevin Kline (As Always) gives a spectacular performance, Hayden Christensen Though this was my first time seeing him, he impressed me a lot. And I have High hopes for him in Star Wars. The only thing that urked me a little in this movie (which is why i gave it 4 starrs and not 5), was  that there should have been more. In one scene the house isn't built. The next, the house is half built,, you see? It kinda jumps and skips a little too much and they should have spent more time on things like that even hough the movie clocked in at around 2 hrs. So i guess you have to make cuts here and there. But DO NOT miss out on this movie. It is a very emotional and moving picture with a brilliant performance by all cast members involved....",1015459200,8,954,4.074468085106383
1679937,5,B00005YUSL,"Some people say that LIFE AS A HOUSE is like a Soap Opera, and I guess it kind of is. But it is a realistic Soap Opera, and the things that happen in this story could happen to someone in real life--it's not like the things that happen on Soaps like ""Passions"" or ""General Hospital"" (even though I enjoy watching Soap Operas, most of them are pretty unrealistic).
Kevin Kline stars as a middle-aged divorced man who finds out that his life is about to end. He wants to do all the things he never got a chance to do--like reconnect with his ex-wife and rebellious teenage son, and rebuild the runt-down beach shack he has near his house. LIFE AS A HOUSE is full of rollercoaster emotions.
The storyline is well-written, and the performences by the entire cast is absolutely superb and flawless. Kevin Kline is in one of his best performances yet, Hayden Christensen plays Sam, the troubled rebellious teenage son. I have to say that Christensen is absolutely a wonderful young actor. He is very realistic as Sam--dressing in all black, painting his nails, and messing up his golden-blonde hair was just one of the reasons why he earned a Golden Globes nomination (and hopefully an Oscar). But the rest was all talent--he is an incredible actor, and portrayed Sam like no other. For this, I cannot wait to see him in STAR WARS-EPISODE II, ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Kirsten Scott-Thomas is also flawless as the mother of Sam.
If you don't like the story, at least you should go to see LIFE AS A HOUSE for the award-winning performances. LIFE AS A HOUSE is one of the best dramas of the year, topping the list with the likes of IN THE BEDROOM.
LIFE AS A HOUSE is a must-see movie. So if you have not seen it yet, then what are you waiting for? Better yet--wait until the DVD comes out so you can buy it on DVD instead.",1012694400,,1810,4.438438438438438
1679938,4,B00005YUSL,"The latest Kevin Kline vehicle, Life as a House is further proof that Kline is one of greatest and most under appreciated actor of our times. Kline plays George, who has cancer and lives alone in a dilapidated old shack that his late father left him. When he loses his job, he takes custody of his sixteen year old son, Sam. George wants to repair his relationship with his son before it is too late. Sam is an extremely troubled young man. He does drugs, he listens to Marilyn Manson, he has blue hair and numerous piercings, and most dangerously, he's taken to temporarily hanging himself from his closet bar to get a rush. His mother, Robin is unable to reach him. She's got her own problems dealing with her faltering marriage to Peter.
Sounds like a soap opera, doesn't it? And a rather lame one, at that. But in the hands of these able actors, it isn't. Kline is especially effective as George. He is equally adept at playing both the movie's dramatic and comic moments. In the hands of a lesser actor, the revelation of George's abusive childhood would have seem trite and clichd. Kline finds the truth in the moment. He shows that George gets that he can't erase his past, or suddenly have a picture perfect Hallmark card relationship with Sam. He just wants to somehow try to connect with his kid, and help him. He sees that Sam is as angry with him as he was at his own dad; that he is sinking under the weight of his own anger and pain, and he wants to somehow break the cycle. George doesn't reveal his illness to Robin and Sam until near the end of the movie. This fact could either make George appear like a martyr or a bastard. As Kline plays him, he is neither - he is simply a human being.
Kline and Christensen (and to a lesser extent, Kristen  are the heart, soul and center of this movie, and the two deliver. They have a palpable chemistry and play a believable father and son
Hayden Christensen is a revelation. I admit, he was a bit awkward and shouted too much in some of his angry scenes, but he made it work for the character. I empathized with Sam. I wanted to know more about him and where is anger came from. This type of character is often a clich (and, admittedly, he was, to an extent), but Christensen managed to rise above it. He gave Sam an awkwardness, a sadness in his eyes, that made him seem vulnerable and real. I especially like that although Sam admits he loves his father, the ambivalence and anger never completely fades. Christensen and Kline bring a real depth to this relationship.  The rest of the cast was equally good although many of their roles were quite small - this movie was about Sam and George, and Robin, to a lesser extent. I was disappointed that Scott Thomas's role was so underwritten; she's a brilliant actress. She did a beautiful job in the scenes where George reveals his illness, and when he dies. She and Kline have a nice chemistry.
I have to talk about the flaws in this movie. I have to admit, it is riddled with clichs. I hated that Robin fell back in love with George - a deeper understanding and a friendship would've been better.  The characters needed more depth.  There were also too many subplots in the movie. In the end, everyone comes together to help George and Sam finish the house he's building, and I'm never quite sure why. In moments like that the movie seems to be trying to be like the movie American Beauty, and that doesn't work. Those are the moments that are especially soap opera-like. The movie needed to stay focused on the George and his relationships.
In the end, I would still recommend this movie, although maybe only on video or on cheap night. The sheer quality of the acting, the gorgeous ocean cinematography, and the soundtrack make it worthwhile, despite the plodding pace and clichs in the writing.",1011139200,3,3806,4.471942446043165

The humor is subtle and isn't slapstick, it works quite well with the movie. This movie is for anyone that just wants to see an extremely well made movie, that will take them on a rollercoaster of emotions.",1010102400,,551,3.9285714285714284
1679940,4,B00005YUSL,"""Life as a House,"" directed by Irwin Winkler, stars Kevin Kline as George, a divorced architect who lives in a decaying eyesore of his own by the shore. His ex-wife, Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas) and their substance-abusing son Sam (Hayden Christensen) live nearby with Robin's current husband and two more children. After losing his job, George sets out to tear down his current home and, together with his estranged son, build a house of which he can be truly proud.
I have seen and heard ""House"" compared to the film ""American Beauty."" Certainly the two films share many elements: a middle aged man separated from his job and undergoing a personal crisis; a nymphettish teen female character; familial discord; and Scott Bakula in a likeable supporting role. But ""House"" has a more conventional, soap opera-ish quality, and lacks the surreal inventiveness of ""Beauty."" Still, ""House"" is on the whole a moving and entertaining drama.
The best thing about ""House"" is the fine work done by a great ensemble cast. Kline brings a visceral sense of pain and a transcendent grace to his role. Christensen is a revelation: he is truly frightening in his nihilistic ""teen from hell"" mode, and brings great depth to Sam's character arc. Mary Steenburgen brings a sympathetic lustiness to her performance as George's neighbor, and Jena Malone impressed me as her daughter.
The script offers some thoughtful reflections on life, love, pain, and reconciliation. The house building theme is well integrated into the family drama. The film is not without flaws. In particular, there is one unnecessary plot twist which may strike some viewers as homophobic. But all things considered, I recommend ""Life As a House"" for those seeking a good adult drama with an outstanding ensemble cast.",1008547200,9,1773,5.075342465753424
1679941,4,B00005YUSL,"This movie demonstrated some very complex dynamics involving a Father Son (Rebellious Teenager) relationship. George (played by Kevin Kline) needed to reconcile the inherited errors of his father by resolving his estranged relationship with his Son. Sam (played by Hayden Christensen) did an excellent job portraying a confused adolescent in dire need of some dedicated parental attention. Sam's apprehension to accept any parental love was frankly a well defined page out of both teenager and parent's diary. The relationship between the confused teenager and the flawed parents presents realistic complexities. The story line in of itself was good. The additional entertainment of some obscure relationships acting as a theatrical counterpoint to the main line of the story was quite weak and a waste of film time in this reviewers opinion. Unfortunately it is understandable that the director may deem these scenes necessary to maintain the commercial film standard.
I would suggest that it is worth seeing as well as enables the audience an opportunity to grab some more popcorn when those inconsequential fillins pop up with out missing much.",1008288000,,1147,5.41340782122905

1679947,4,B00005YUSL,"LIFE AS A HOUSE has as its premise that hard work and responsibility will reshape for the better the most incorrigible of teenagers. Joining the Marines will do it. Alternatively, build a house.
Kevin Kline plays terminal cancer patient George, who violently quits his job with an architectural firm and decides to spend his last months rebuilding his house. ""House"" is a grand overstatement. It's actually a run-down shack that sits incongruously and improbably (oh, puh-leeze!) amidst million-dollar homes perched on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean washing Southern California's Gold Coast. I've seen similar dilapidated structures along back roads in the Deep South. In any case, George wants to spend this time with his teenage son, Sam, who otherwise lives with George's former wife Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas) and her latest husband, bland Peter. Sam is a self-loathing, skin-pierced, drug-ridden, hostile young man who has alienated every member of his natural and foster families. George believes that several months spent in his custody demolishing the old shack and building a new abode will turn Sam's life around. Getting Sam to join the Marines would probably have been easier.
LIFE AS A HOUSE is a tangle of relationships, all of which are predictable. George has a forty-something next door neighbor, Coleen, who is the single mother of teenage Alyssa. (Mary Steenburgen, playing Coleen, is still a Looker in black lingerie.) After George's break-up with Robin years before, George and Coleen had an affair. Now, Coleen seduces her daughter's boyfriend, Josh, while Alyssa makes coy sexual advances to both George and Sam, the latter's hostility faltering in the face of reluctantly resurgent hormones. I mean, how LA! Only the bittersweet relationship between George and Robin has substance. Indeed, the performances of Kline and Thomas vis--vis each other are what elevate this film above mediocrity, and Kline's is perhaps the best of his career - certainly worth an Oscar nomination. The audience will find the George and Robin characters eminently decent and likable - just the kind of people you'd love to have over for an afternoon barbecue and schmooze by the pool.
In many ways, this film is a shameless tearjerker of only moderate depth. However, I'm not too proud to admit that I liked it anyway.",1006905600,,2329,5.196808510638298

1679961,4,B00005YUSL,"As a director, Irwin Winkler has been responsible for some average movies with great casts: ""The Net,"" (Sandra Bullock and Jeremy Northam) ""At First Sight"" (Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino)and ""Night and the City"" (Robert De Niro and Jessica Lange) to name a few. And once again in ""Life as a House""  he is saved... this time by an extraordinary cast: Kevin Kline (George), Kristin Scott Thomas (Robin), Hayden Christensen (Sam), Jena Malone (Alyssa) and Mary Steenburgen (Coleen). Winkler is much more successful as a producer, the original and best ""Rocky"" being one of his producing credits.
Kline and Scott-Tomas are pros and almost everything they do in this movie is perfect...all Winkler had to do was make sure they hit their marks and that the camera was in focus.  But Christensen is a newcomer, and even though he does an excellent job overall, some of his scenes are overwrought and simply don't ring true...where it is obvious he is play-acting.  Ditto for Malone, who is always excellent and is particularly radiant in this film, a firm director would have pulled her back from seeming overly coy and fake in a couple of her scenes.
The basic story is simple: A dying man (Kline) decides to clean up his life by tearing down his eye-sore house and building a new one and in the process hopes to repair his relationship with his son (Christensen)whom he has neglected and ""written off.""
There is real magic in all the scenes between Kline and Scott-Thomas.  The kind of magic that hits you right in the pit of your stomach.  Why are both of these actors so underused and under appreciated?
Rebuilding a house as a metaphor for rebuilding one's life is obvious and corny without a doubt, but it works here despite my reservations and Kline, Scott-Thomas, Christensen, Malone and Steenburgen are the reasons why.",1005609600,14,1819,4.8173076923076925

1679963,1,B00005YUSL,"A great picture of dysfunctionalism. I found the plot hard to follow because there was no real character involvement from the beginning, with the exception of the obnoxious teenager, I wanted to ""kill"" him from the beginning (not literally, but if he were my kid, I'd have pulled every poster and CD out of room and used it for firewood, and my kid yelled at me or talked to me like that I'd have packed their bag for them). Do I blame him? Yes and No. His self-indulgent parents were as much to blame. A kid like this is crying out (inside) for help and all they do is let him get deeper involved as they don't have the skills to help him. I found it laughable that the mother when talking to her new husband about his inability to reach out and physically ""hug"" his kids (which by the way I think is a 9 on my 1-10 scale of important things to do everyday, 10 is practice what you preach), was more concerned with that issue than walking in on her own son huffing, while hanging from the closet clothes rod. Did she seek professional help for this kid? No. She yelled at her ex to take him for the Summer, and she told the boy (yes, boy age 16) he could go to Lake Tahoe for the Summer with his friend, another mature decision on her part.
Honestly I'm surprised the boy stayed in school as long as he did, with parents as un-interested in his well-being or influence on the other two young boys in the house (impressionable boys, learning from the older one). Meanwhile the father, in his own little world finds out he has only 4 months to live, and they never really set this up for you, and than bam all of a sudden 10 years of an ""absence"" from this kids life he walks in and makes the kid go with him for the Summer, because he has ""worn out his welcome"" at his home with his mother and her new family. (OK to be fair he was taking the kid every other weekend but now the kid doesn't want to go anymore, typical). This movie went from slow starter, bad, to really bad, quick.
