1256244,3,B00002SWEC,"This 1994 recording of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir was not very well recorded.  Had you listed the date of recording, I would not have ordered something this old.",1356652800,,162,4.785714285714286
1256245,5,B00002SWEC,"This was taped in the Tabernacle in 1994 with Jerrold Ottley conducting and the Tabernacle organists. The video isn't up to today's standards but the sound is glorious -- vintage Tabernacle Choir and before the orchestra all but obliterated the organ. Anyone who remembers the choir from its glory days with Ottley when they were still singing in the Tabernacle will love this ""souvenir."" It's all about the music, not glitz and glam and choreography. Ordering more for gifts.",1354147200,,476,5.037974683544304
1256246,5,B00002SWEC,It's a great DVD to listen to or watch. Wonderful to have it around for the Holidays and get into the Christmas spirit.,1323907200,2,119,4.217391304347826
1256247,2,B00002SWEC,It was really disappointing; neither the Mormon Tabernacle Choir part nor the Vienna Boys Choir part was really good; too much talking.,1292457600,,135,5.181818181818182
1256248,5,B00002SWEC,All the favorite Christmas Carols with the large and beautifully tuned Tabernacle Choir. This whole program is excellent music. The Vienna Boy's Choir add contrast to the fullness of the TAB choir. The album gets one in a great spirit for the real meaning of Christmas. Best choir in the land.,1279756800,,293,4.764705882352941
1256249,1,B00002SWEC,"The audio is fine, great music. The video for the Vienna Boy's Choir portion seemed silly and takes away from the music. This might work best just to hear the audio and turn off the video.",1198627200,,188,4.25
1256250,5,B00002SWEC,"This performance of this choir is a testament of the unshakable faith that Mormons have in Jesus Christ, our Savior, the literal son of God, the Father.  It touches the heart in an amazing way.",1197072000,3,193,4.514285714285714
1256251,3,B00002SWEC,"I find that the M.T. Choir sounds better on their Christmas music cds than they do on this DVD. And why WILL they change the words? It's written: ""And heaven and nature sing"" and they have changed it to: ""And saints and nature sing"". The production values are acceptable. And the Vienna Choir Boys portion is pleasant, but presented in the form of a ""story"" which I found silly and unnecessary. Just to hear them sing the carols is enough. The production values are fine.

Overall: three stars. It could have been a lot better.",1167177600,6,527,4.5473684210526315
1256252,4,B00002SWEC,"I have NO idea how this DVD can be sold for such a low price, unless it is being underwritten by the LDS Church!  The first half is typical tabernacle choir-- always good.  The second half is actually the ""Christmas With  the Vienna Boys Choir"" video which is available by itself on VHS for  more than this DVD costs. This fact is NOT given on-line, leading one to  think the DVD contains some sort of combined performance of the two groups.  The Vienna portion is an excellent production-- showing the boys not only  in their usual sailor suits, but also in their everyday clothes as they go  about enjoying the Christmas traditions of Austria.  Most of the singing is  lip-sync (to their own recorded voices), but that does not detract from the  very colorful and inspiring production.  You will feel better about the  future of humanity after watching and listening to these boys!",951868800,63,883,4.69281045751634

7916256,5,B00002SWEC,"I chose the rating because my husband and I enjoyed the DVD immensely.  My husband is in a Long Term Care Home and music is one of the best things which he enjoys.  The pipe organ is fabulous as are the singers and orchestra.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys choir music.",1389398400,2,287,4.181818181818182
7916257,5,B00002SWEC,"This is a wonderful CD, especially at Christmas. It has alot of great songs on it and they do such a great job singing as always. Even if you aren't Mormon, you will just love this music.",1387238400,,187,4.081081081081081
