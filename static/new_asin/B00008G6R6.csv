7982837,5,B00008G6R6,This group has incredible talent and humor to spare. Their takes on established ballet make it easy to identify the ballet yet view it in a whimsical and not too irreverent way. What they accomplish is total entertainment at only the expense of laughing nonstop till the end. A must see for anyone who really enjoys having a good time.,1331769600,,335,4.6
7982838,5,B00008G6R6,"more fun with the ballet.  loved it .  lots of laughs.  My favorite was the ""Dying Swan"".  Every detail to add to the humor!",1280016000,,124,4.041666666666667
7982839,4,B00008G6R6,I actually think this volume is funnier than the first.  You just have to have an appreciation of men dancing female parts in the ballet.  Too funny!,1184284800,,149,4.481481481481482
7982840,5,B00008G6R6,"Great photography and points of view-Vol One was equally entertaining. The possibility of freezing the action increases the pleasure of the very accomplished dancers by admiting their positions and , especially, their facial responses.",1179014400,4,235,5.9411764705882355
7982841,5,B00008G6R6,"If you are looking for something a little different in ballet, you should try this. the Trockadero troupe offers comedy, men dancing on pointe as women, and men dancing as men.(Unfortunately, they do not offer men dancing on pointe as men, which has been explored by others, nor do they explore women dancing as men.) They are very entertaining and dance quite well, showing a serious side in addition to the comedy. They are also one of the most financially successful ballet troupes in existence! The company director points out that they also make it a point ( a pointe? ) to do unusual pieces, not done much by other companies, such as ""Raymonda's Wedding"" in volume one(volume one is also available through Amazon.com) and ""Yes Virginia, Another Piano Ballet"" in volume two. As a male ballet dancer myself, the differences in what makes movement masculine or feminine is something I and all serious dancers explore; perhaps this troupe helps shed some light on this. The overall emphasis here is comedy, not any heavy message, so this dvd should appeal to a wide audience.",1143504000,8,1077,4.858695652173913
7982842,5,B00008G6R6,"The ""Trocks"" just get better. Fine ballet coupled with subtle humour ( and sometimes not so subtle ) is not to be missed. Love it.",1141257600,7,130,4.24
7982843,5,B00008G6R6,"Please disregard the ""one star "" review. It seems that was totally politically motivated. I've seen Les Ballets Trokadero live many times and they are always very enjoyable. The video is no exception. They are witty and dance with very good tecniques. A must for all ballet lovers!",1069459200,28,281,4.875
