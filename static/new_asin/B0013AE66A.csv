8249591,5,B0013AE66A,"Warner Brothers...how you doin'? If you are using the powers of unagi - you must be aware how many people can't wait for ""Friends"" to be released on beautiful 1080p BluRay - including my good friends Regina Falange, Ken Adams and Chanandler Bong.

Worried that in a tough economy, now is not the best time to release the complete series because consumers will be ""on a break""?  I know!  But don't freak out, because - OH MY GOD, friends fans will be there for you....you got nubbin to worry about.",1327190400,12,497,4.5

I've had the complete series on DVD for some time but seeing it in true HD is awesome, compared to the dreadful HD upconversion on TBS. I didn't think I would get it on blu-ray but after seeing it in HD I think I would.",1321142400,3,278,4.166666666666667
8249593,5,B0013AE66A,myself and my wife are crazy with Friends. we watch it every evening in comedy central HD. I love the HD transmission. I would love to buy the blu-ray for all 1-10 seasons no matter what the price would be.,1318636800,4,206,4.175
8249594,5,B0013AE66A,"Okay, first, before all of you `know it alls' start saying: ""But Friends was filmed in SD and is 4:3 and would look awful on blu-ray, there's no point"" Well, you are wrong, Friends wasn't shot on standard video. Unlike most other sitcoms of it's time, it was filmed in HD in widescreen on 35mm film (the same film used for todays blockbuster movies) but it was then edited on video, meaning it would be standard definition, and not widescreen (which was basically the same as every television at the time)

So, what would be needed to pull off a task as putting Friends on blu-ray would be to go through all the original footage and re-edit using the original editors notes. Now, FOX stated that Friends will be on blu-ray in the future. And... on the bbfc website (ratings) all the early episodes of Friends(first few seasons) have been re-rated for a future release (obviously the widescreen releases!)

So, definitely before the year is out, we will have the first (if not first few) seasons of Friends in HD in 16:9 on blu-ray!

EDIT (4/4/11):

Take a look at these two screenshots.

DVD (SD, 4:3) [...]
TNT (HD, 16:9)  [...]

One is from the DVD, the other is from TNT:HD. As you can see, the TNT:HD screenshot has been widened, and the original image is not cropped at all. We get extra information on this sides, and even a little bit extra on the top and bottom. The quality can not be a representative of what the blu-ray will be as it is in 720p, but rest assured it is clearly a remaster of the original source material and I'm sure that either this year or early next we will have at least the first season on blu-ray! This is also coupled with this report:  [...]

So, it looks like Friends definitely will be coming to blu-ray, and not cropped at all as it has been widened to 16:9, and not upscaled from SD as it has been clearly remastered from the original source material. This is incredibly exciting news for everyone and all I can say is: I was right!!!",1272758400,49,1973,4.428176795580111
