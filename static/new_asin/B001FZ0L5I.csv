Horrible dialogue, over acting and waaaaay too many tears and prayers. The main plot hinges on the murder of the sainted Patricia (Montserrat Olivier), with her best friend Maria (Victoria Ruffo) wrongly convicted for the crime. Maria is released from prison after 20 long years, still insisting she is innocent.

This has many rounds of Who's Your Daddy? (and Momma), and as the story proceeds we discover that the sainted Patricia was not at ALL what she seemed. Turns out that practically everyone in the family had a good reason to murder her. Maria's husband Esteban (Csar bora), through a cleverly crafted turn of events is charged with the same crime his wife just paid for with 20 years of her life. Problem is, HE is given the death penalty, not a life sentence; his defense attorney didn't file the appeal in time, so his execution is imminent.

About halfway through the second disc, that defense attorney, Demetrio (Guillermo Garcia Cant, in what had seemed to be an uncharacteristic supporting role), suddenly moves to center stage. In my opinion, this is the best chance he has ever had to show off his acting chops and he uses it well.

As we watch the development of four young adults into grownups, we see them mature, find love and accept the woman who is actually their mother but who they think is their most unwelcome (jailbird) stepmother. This is the big lie that lurks throughout most of this telenovela.

The ultimate happy ending is delayed until the 10th Anniversary special, so be sure the set you watch includes it. Amazon doesn't say if this version has English captions. The other set definitely DOES!",1407542400,,1677,4.809027777777778
