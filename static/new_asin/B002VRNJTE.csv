4001552,1,B002VRNJTE,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.  IT IS NOT THE CLASSIC HENRY FONDA FILM.  I purchased this for my classroom, and the cover looks right (because it is black and white,but the image is too small to easily identify the characters are not the same).

4001556,3,B002VRNJTE,"Maybe I've been spoiled by seeing the movie version so many times, but Robert Cummings can't hold a candle to Henry Fonda in the starring role. But it was interesting to see the original fiirst filmed version from the vintage television era.

4001558,2,B002VRNJTE,"The problemn with this movie is once you have seen the one with Henry Fonda, this one just doesnt compare to the stellar cast of actors in the Fonda version.

4001559,5,B002VRNJTE,"I wanted to watch the original TV presentation of this excellent courtroom drama.  I understood that the visual was not adjusted to our today's expectations, but considering the period and time of television broadcasting, I didn't mind.  It is still as powerful as the
Henry Fonda's version.",1360972800,,291,5.170212765957447
4001560,5,B002VRNJTE,"12 ANGRY MEN was broadcast on CBS-TV's live drama series STUDIO ONE on 9/20/54. After decades of searching, a complete kinescope copy of this program (minus commercials) was located in 2003. This dub was made from that film, which is in fair to good shape. There are a couple of audio dropouts and occasional white spots but no repaired breaks.

Technically, the program isn't perfect. At times the camera can't keep up with the action. A good example is the twin switchblade sequence. We miss the first knife being jabbed into the juryroom table; the camera dollies to get a clear shot as Bob Cummings drops the second blade beside it. We see only his arm movement, then a pan down to reveal both knives standing in place.

Pacing is also hurried compared to the 1957 feature film, which has an extra hour to explore the case and jurors. For a live braodcast however, this is quite impressive, flaws and all.

""12 Angry Men"" is a still relevant study of what is potentially the weakest link in the American justice system: the jury. Although charged by a judge to retire for deliberations with an open mind, as this broadcast shows, most enter that jury room already decided on a defendant's guilt or innocence. As we see here, an individual's background, history and prejudices often hinder the ability to consider any evidence but those pieces supporting his own preconceived conclusions.

Thus, once the door is locked behind them, eleven men on this ""unbiased"" panel immediately declare a young minority defendant guilty of murdering his father. One lone juror holds out, believing that some discussion is necessary before sending a man to his death. As they delve into the facts and testimony of this ""open and shut"" case, one by one the other deliberators find reasonable doubt, and what had seemed a landslide toward conviction is no longer so certain. Along the way, idiosyncracies of these men are revealed that are not always flattering to some, yet the wheels of justice turn despite human failings and perhaps miraculously, a fair verdict is reached.

Parenthetical number is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.

8382432,5,B002VRNJTE,"There's a great temptation to make comparisons between Reginald Rose's first version of the classic play, premiered in CBS's STUDIO ONE anthology series and Sidney Lumet's film released three years later. Other reviewers have made detailed studies of the two films, so it would be repetitive of me to do so here.

Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, a veteran of STUDIO ONE who would subsequently carve out a film career, this TWELVE ANGRY MEN brings out the claustrophobic surroundings of the jury-room. All twelve jurors are cooped up in a confined space on a hot evening, unable to escape until they have made a decision. They do not know one another, but they are expected to work as a team to reach a unanimous verdict. The sheer strain of reaching consensus proves too much for them; through an intelligent use of closeups focusing on the jurors' expressions, Schaffner makes us aware of just how stressed they actually are. Hence it comes as no surprise to find them continually moving around the confined space - sitting down, standing up, walking around in circles, moving towards and away from the camera, and finding a brief refuge at the back of the room near the door. Schaffner's camera tracks them; it's clear that he will never give the actors any respite from its penetrating lens.

The play as a whole has distinct religious echoes, with the twelve disciples of justice sitting round a long wooden table pronouncing judgment. For juror #3, excellently played by Franchot Tone, anyone voting against the decision is a Judas, as they have willfully ignored what would appear to be clear evidence to the contrary. However Juror #8, played in low-key fashion by Robert Cummings, refuses to accept the majority's will; he does not appear entirely sure of himself on occasions, but he is prepared to weigh up the evidence in a careful manner that contrasts starkly with Tone's impetuosity. The religious echoes are here used to remind us about the importance of considering all people good until they are proved guilty ""beyond reasonable doubt."" To do otherwise is simply unchristian.

The drama unfolds as a series of movements, each punctuated by a commercial break, and rises to a climax as Juror #3 is finally left isolated. Tone's performance is a memorable one, as he clasps and unclasps his hands, hangs on to the back of a chair and pretends to draw the switchblade knife on Juror #8 before leaving the room. It's clear he shares the same pathological tendencies as the boy he sought to commit to the electric chair.

When first broadcast, TWELVE ANGRY MEN had such a powerful effect that it resulted in a rethinking of the American justice system. Over six decades later it still has the power to command our attention as a brilliantly staged piece of drama.",1458691200,,2778,4.8544303797468356
