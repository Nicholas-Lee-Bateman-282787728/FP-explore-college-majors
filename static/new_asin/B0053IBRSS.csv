8455274,3,B0053IBRSS,Not bad little mystery about a controlling despot who gets offed by any one of the may people he screwed over.  Now everyone is tripping over themselves trying to solve the murder of this crud.  The quality of the DVD-R is so-so.  Judging from the cover I believe it is a copy of a Sinister Cinema DVD-R.  Hopefully a re-mastered version is released very soon.,1409961600,2,360,4.492307692307692
8455275,3,B0053IBRSS,"This is a good ""B"", who done it movie.
But do not buy the copy from Cinema Classics. It is one of the worst picture quality movies I have ever seen.
It looks like they recorded it from an old VHS tape that was recorded on EP.",1375228800,2,225,3.8085106382978724
