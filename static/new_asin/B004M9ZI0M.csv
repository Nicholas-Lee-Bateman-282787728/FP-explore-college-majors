4429321,5,B004M9ZI0M,"William Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST is probably his last play, written in 1610-11, and as such it has some of the more eloquent passages of soliloquies of any of his works. In the original version the story is set on a remote island, 'where Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan, plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place, using illusion and skilful manipulation. The eponymous tempest brings to the island Prospero's usurping brother Antonio and the complicit Alonso, King of Naples. There, his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's low nature, the redemption of Alonso, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son, Ferdinand.' Enter Julie Taymor and the imaginative play becomes even more so with her deft re-writing and direction and use of visual effects.  In Taymor's versions 'the main character is now a woman named Prospera. Going back to the 16th or 17th century, women practicing the magical arts of alchemy were often convicted of witchcraft. In Taymor's version, Prospera is usurped by her brother and sent off with her four-year daughter on a ship. She ends up on an island; it's a tabula rasa: no society, so the mother figure becomes a father figure to Miranda. This leads to the power struggle and balance between Caliban and Prospera; a struggle not about brawn, but about intellect.'

Taymor and Shakespeare together make the important character of Ariel, Prospera's obedient sprite, a thing of magic: Ben Wishaw darts and floats and flies about apparently in the buff in a most ingenious fashion, delivering his lines in perfect Shakespearean cadence (his 'Full fathom five thy father lies... ' is exquisite).  The transformation of Prospero to Prospera is magical with Helen Mirren once again proving that she is an incomparably fine actress (one great moment is her delivery of the lines 'Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and are melted into air, into thin air: And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.')

THE TEMPEST is an odd assortment of magic, treachery, young love, silly comedy, and odd goings on, but filled with a cast such as Taymor has selected it jumps alive with passion and glee.  Caliban is Djimon Hounsou, Miranda is Felicity Jones, The King of Naples is David Strathairn and his son Ferdinand is young Reeve Carney, Prospera's brother Antonio is Chris Cooper and his sidekick Sebastian is Alan Cumming, and the two actors assigned to the buffoon roles are Albert Molina and Russell brand.  Gonzalo is Tim Conti.  This  tightened Tempest works well though one wonders how much of the opening scenes' shipwreck (due to Prospera's calling upon the tempest) adds to the overall story.  Yet in Taymor's vision it all comes together beautifully.  The sung portions of the play and the musical sore in general are from the intelligent pen of Elliot Goldenthal.  Recommended!

4429322,3,B004M9ZI0M,This would have been a great play rather than a movie.  They actors recited their lines in play like precision.  I expected more special effects from a movie like this.,1316304000,,168,4.566666666666666
4429323,5,B004M9ZI0M,"I saw this movie at the Chicago Film Festival last fall, introduced by Alan Cumming. While I'm a huge fan of Helen Mirren (and Alan), I was much less familiar with Julie Taymor, and not sure what I was in for.

If you're the same, then you can relax - this is brilliant, and I wish that Mirren & Taymor would do some other Shakespeare plays with Helen in the (strong, male) lead. Aside from a few minutes in the very beginning, where I thought the verisimilitude of the storm interfered with actually being able to understand what the actors were SAYING - there weren't any problems with either the language or being able to follow the plot.

Despite changing of the gender of the lead character, all the other elements we expect from Shakespeare remain intact: elevated, aristocratic figures bickering over their positions or inheritance, a love story featuring the younger generation of characters, a comedic subplot running alongside the primary plot, etc. And the acting was great top to bottom - those who weren't aware that RusselL Brand could actually act will be very pleasantly surprised, and we get the amazing performances we expected from the ""known"" names. Reeve Carney comes off least well, but that is the fault of the character having so little to do (and most of THAT being to look attractive and moon over the young woman).

All in all, I was very happy I was able to catch this in the cinema, and can hardly wait until I'm able to own a copy.",1314316800,78,1461,4.611538461538461
4429324,5,B004M9ZI0M,"The final Opus of William Shakespeare was carried to the big screen with that required vision, secure pulse and distinguished visuals without lacking the spirit of the play.

Helen Mirren is actually (Who can deny it?)one of the three best actresses in the world. She chews the whole show all the way through. But additionally the narrative rhtyhm never decays. Taymor (The Lion king and Titus, proves by far how domains Shakespeare's nerve) never abuses of the visual effects (dislike many of her colleagues).

And the outcome could not be more succesful. One of the best twenty films of the last year. No doubt it and go for it.",1309132800,54,630,4.770642201834862
4429325,5,B004M9ZI0M,"Shakespeare could not draw flies on a battlefield of rotting corps on a hot summer night in August. Crowds only go to Shakespeare's plays when they are free.

The storied Delacort Theater, Central Park, NYC, NY would be empty if there was an admission price to pay. This festival is populated by pompous asses who don't have a dime, putting on airs of expertise regarding the legend, William Shakespeare.

Wanted to see The Tempest but figured it will be out on DVD in a month, so why spend the money on a flick that has no subtitles-right? That is why I skipped it even though the arty/farty theater/cinema that was showing The Tempest was in walking distance from my apartment on the trendy Upper West Side of Manhattan.

Consider myself the holder of the largest collection of William Shakespeare on audio cassette, DVD, VCD and CDs in the world, more than Amazon, more than the NY Public Library, more than the Folger Library and more than Oxford or Cambridge.

There is no interest in William Shakespeare whatsoever. That is why no mainstream theater will show his work.

4429326,3,B004M9ZI0M,"I feel very cheated that I didn't hear about this movie until after its very limited release was over. From what I can tell it was only in one theater in my state, for about a week! For such an interesting looking film I don't understand this crazy marketing scheme. Like you're going to make any money by not releasing it where people can actually see it! I am a Shakespeare fan, and a fantasy fan, and I have always wanted to see a fully fantastical version of The Tempest. With Helen Mirren playing Prospera, it's bound to be amazing. Now not only did I miss it in theaters, I have to wait until September for the DVD? I seriously don't get it. Why are you pissing off your target audience here?",1302566400,4,698,4.295454545454546
4429327,5,B004M9ZI0M,"Why in the world would they delay the DVD release until September?  How long was in release, a month?

4429328,5,B004M9ZI0M,"Let me say right off: I am a total Bardolator.  I teach Shakespeare, I am obsessed with Shakespeare, I have read and seen all the plays, and my love affair with the Bard began with seeing a live performance of The Tempest in 1975.  It was pure magic.  I also love movies, and I believe that in the 21st century, filmed versions of Shakespeare's plays are probably the best way to reach the widest audience.  The sneers and sniffs of snobs aside, I am convinced that if Will were alive today, he'd be writing movie screenplays (or even television), NOT stage plays, which today are aimed at a narrow, elite, theatre-going audience.

As a literature professor who has been teaching The Tempest for a decade now, I have always been singularly bemused by the lack of a filmed version that really captures the magical spirit of the play.  The old TV Richard Burton show is well-acted but silly, the BBC version has great actors but terrible, flat production values, Prospero's Books is brilliant but incomprehensible to all but those who know the play intimately, Derek Jarman's version is terribly dated and, despite being a good ""film,"" just doesn't work as The Tempest, in my opinion.  The other, ""scholastic"" releases are plagued by poor production and/or undistinguished acting. And I won't even bother with ""adaptations"" of the plot, such as Forbidden Planet or Cassavettes's Tempest.

Until this version, the only truly excellent version of The Tempest was the HBO animated one, but at 25 minutes, not much of Shakespeare's story remained intact.

Just last week I had the great pleasure of seeing Julie Taymor's The Tempest in London.  It was absolutely amazing.  The magic was there!  The acting, for the most part, was brilliant.  The script contained enough of the actual play's language that the minor tweakings to make it easier for contemporary audiences did not bother me a bit.  The visuals were absolutely stunning.  The movie was a joy from start to finish.  I can't wait to see it again--repeatedly--to savor all the special moments over and again.  My only regret is that my students will be unable to see it this year due to the late release date.

[REVISION NOTE: This year's students had the opportunity to see this version, and they overwhelmingly LOVED it.  It brought the play to life for them.  At last, I no longer have to convince them that The Tempest really IS a great play! 01/19/12]

4429329,4,B004M9ZI0M,"If you've been following the travails of Julie Taymor's Spiderman production for Broadway, you will understand them a little better once you watch the opening shipwreck scene in her version of The Tempest.  It is elaborate and detailed and far removed from the play itself, which of course opens with a brief onboard scene and then goes to Prospero and Miranda on shore for a long scene of explication of their exile on the island.  The genius in Taymor's take on the Tempest is to give us Prospera instead of Prospero and, especially, to give us Helen Mirren as Prospera.  She is wonderful as always, and convincing throughout.  I loved her delivery of the Act 4, Scene 1 ""Our revels now are ended"" speech that captures both the play and life itself in a few short lines.  The rest of the cast, Chris Cooper, Russell Brand et al, is uniformly excellent except the young actor who plays Ferdinand and who reads his lines like he is, well, reading his lines from a script held in his hands.  Taymor takes liberties with Shakespeare's text (the credits read something like ""written by Julie Taymor based on a text by William Shakespeare"") and Prospera's epilogue is a song over the closing credits, but overall this Tempest is in spirit faithful to the play and well worth seeing.",1295481600,102,1278,4.683035714285714

4429344,5,B004M9ZI0M,"My private student and I agree.  This is perfection!  About time Prospero's role was played by a woman. . .and Helen Mirren is not ordinary woman.  Her performance is extraordinary!  The entire cast is so carefully chosen.  Who else could the ""clowns"" be except for Russel Brand and Alfred Molina?

We studied five plays. . . not ""reading"" them as we all were made to do when we went to school.  The Bard did write them to be read, but to be performed.  We studied the language, the period, the setting, all the historiography and of course the characters, plot, etc. And then we did what Shakespeare wrote these for. . .we watched performances!  All fabulous performances now on film. . .and lots of ""teaching guides"" on line. . make this a no-brainer for those home-schooled, or un-schooled.

Henry V is a good one to begin with. . .boys and girls love it.  Don't be afraid to try it with 10 year olds. . .they will ""get it"".  Once they understand the story, etc. and are keyed to watch facial nuances and body language, they will soon forget they are ""hearing"" a language which is difficult. . after five minutes of watching, it all falls into place.

I've been teaching for more than 50 years, but this is the first time I ""taught Shakespeare"". . .and what a success!  I will definitely offer this class to private students again.",1474329600,2,1334,4.527196652719665

The change in Prospeo to Prospera is no biggie, but it does change a key plot element that they deal with without issue. The acting is done well and the cast is great.

However, the movie *completely* screws up the ending and in doing so totally effs up the ENTIRE point of Prospero's actions. The Epilogue is critical to Prospero's release to freedom (release to freedom being central to the plot of the entire play) and by the HORRIBLE singing of the epilogue, the movie fails to provide the appropriate closure.

-First of all, Helen Mirren is a goddess, but she didn't wield the kind of power needed to pull off Prospero, which would need to be doubled to pull it off as a woman. She didn't command the way the role needed her to, and that's upsetting.
-Caliban was a SUPERB acting job, but didn't completely embody the character as I see him. He was a little TOO good, a little too primal, and as a result, took the clowning scenes to a more serious place when they needed to facetious.
-Which brings me to the clowns. Brand is a brilliant guy, and Molina is a superb shakespearean actor, but their scenes fell flat as a result of an almost seemingly confused director. Her choices were just strange whenever the clowns were on screen. Rather sad, because I'll be honest, I'm madly in love with Russell Brand.

Consensus is really that this director has a spectacular eye for beauty and concept, but when it comes to her actors, she failed them. She either sent them astray, or left them floundering and grasping at straws. Very disappointed and honestly... I fast forwarded to the clown scenes because of Russell, let's be real.

I am by no means a Shakespeare expert but I have read his complete collection of works and love the huge vocabulary he uses, his timing, rhythm & word play make his works fun to read again & again. This is a fun movie that even people that are not fans of Shakespeare will enjoy for its magical elements & its great cinematography.  I read some where that William Shakespeare when compared to other great authors used 10,000 words more than the others on average.  The reason this is so cool  is in the meaning of words themselves some words just explain things perfectly while others can be used in juxtaposition with others to create double entandres , similes & other word play or just sound better.  I was around 13 or 14 when I first started reading Shakespeare & I had to have a dictionary by my side to get through his plays, but it was worth it if only for expanding my vocabulary.  Now at 50 I not only have the vocabulary to enjoy Shakespeare but more importantly life experience which really shows how great the man was at capturing the wide range of emotion in the human condition.

There is no real conflict that throws the outcome in doubt.  That's about the play but this production works as well as it possibly can given the reservations I have expressed.  All the performances are superb and I can't say that any are better or worse than any other, they all work so well together.

In The Tempest, the amazing actions take on even greater important when they are controlled by Prospero. The use of Helen Mirren as Prospera is fine, but very little is made of the role being played AS a woman.

4429408,5,B004M9ZI0M,"Julie Taymor's film of Shakespeare's The Tempest would win the Bard's approval. It is a beautiful modern interpretation of an Elizabethan pastoral fantasy. For those not familiar with the play, the story is of the widowed noblewoman Prospera, who is deposed by her brother. The brother lies to the king of Naples, telling him Prospera is a traitor, and has her put adrift in a tiny boat, along with her infant daughter. A friend manages to get her precious spell books into the boat before it is put out on the sea. Prospera and her daughter Miranda become stranded on a magical island where the noblewoman uses her magic arts to kill a cruel witch, enslave the human-like monster that is the witch's offspring, and free the spirits from their prisons. The grateful spirit Ariel aids her in revenge upon her brother and the king. Her opportunity to put the plan into motion comes when the king, his son, his brother, and Prospera's brother put out to sea, and she uses her power to create a great tempest so that they become stranded on her island. Part of her intent is to have the king's son marry her daughter. The people of Shakespeare's day  were no different than the people of our time--they expected to be amazed by surprising interpretations of spirits and wizardly magic. I believe  the film does not disappoint--the special effects design of the important elemental spirit Ariel is ethereal and wind-like, and appropriately startling when he shape-shifts into a tar-colored half-crow, half-woman harpy, or a red-gold blazing Fury. Although Shakespeare's script calls for the main character to be male (Prospero) Director Taymor has chosen to have a female play the role. The experienced and talented Helen Mirren brings all the authority and power necessary for the character, and I feel even people familiar with the story will find her a fine choice to play the sorcerer. I found that the visual beauty of the film matched the beautiful poetry of the spoken words. Instead of costuming the actors in either 16th century or 21st century clothing, Taymor chooses to dress them in a synthesis of both time periods giving the story a time-out-of-time look. The designs fit well with the earthy, fantastical suggestions in the script. Prospera and Miranda wear sand and sea tones of gauze, while the citizens of Naples wear leather and brass. This is a fantasy to richly pleasure the eye and the ear. Humor is provided by Alfred Molina and Russel Brand as the king's servants, who get drunk on a beached crate of wine and proceed to ""take over"" the island. If you are collecting films of Shakespeare's plays, I recommend this version of the Tempest for your video shelf.",1422316800,11,2678,4.832244008714597

4429410,4,B004M9ZI0M,"I sometimes think THE TEMPEST is my favorite work of literature. In part, because I see as a play of intense moral purpose.

(""Poor, murderous, lustful rapist, did that mean magician take your island from you?"") When I taught THE TEMPEST I frequently paired it with DR. FAUSTUS, two Renaissance versions of the magician. And the play is as profoundly Renaissance as is Marlowe's. But modern audience's and theaters don't want to be reminded of history, and find it impossible to watch a period piece and then extrapolate a modern understanding. No, everything has to be yanked into the modern age and the door of the past locked tight. It shows in the masque elements of the play"" Prospero's and Ariel's revels which is based on ancient Roman deities and the fertility mysteries. Not here. We look up into the sky for some bland CG effects and none of Shakespeare's beautiful poetry. Helen Mirren makes this version special. She was so young in the 1960s film of A Midsummer Night's Dream; here she is a mature woman, an accomplished actress and theater magic occurs.

4429434,5,B004M9ZI0M,"I should hate this interpretation of ""The Tempest.""  Directors seem to have a need to mess with Shakespeare, gender changes are usually intensely annoying (despite Shakespeare's own use of the device in other plays), and God help us all when CGI gets into the mix.  But you know...I loved this one.

The success is largely driven by Helen Mirren's outstanding performance as Prospera.  We've come to expect as much from Ms. Mirren, and the play demands it:  Prospero/Prospera creates this story, shaping the elements and the actions of humans in ways that a Hamlet or a Macbeth, trapped by their own fully human destinies and flaws, cannot.  Given that fact, this movie would have fallen apart without a strong performance in the lead role, especially one that asks us to accept Prospero as Prospera.  In some ways it is unfortunate that Helen Mirren is so talented, and at this point in her career, so accomplished.  In ""The Tempest"" she is absolutely riveting, and yet we're inclined to say, ""Another great performance, it's Mirren, what do you expect?""  In this film we get a great deal more than we had a right to expect, thank you very much, and it makes for a great interpretation.

Also worth watching is Ben Whishaw as Ariel.  Mr Whishaw's fans may quibble about the size of his role, or the androgynous interpretation of it, or the heavily digitized massage his performance receives.  (This, dear reader, is where much of the CGI comes in.)  But Whishaw manages to turn in a nuanced treatment of Ariel, a light spirit lightly but firmly held, and one that quietly aches for its freedom.  Giving life to the role and keeping it from becoming simply a digital light show is no small accomplishment, and Whishaw succeeds admirably.

I confess that Shakespeare's late plays, ""The Tempest"" included, have always been a bit difficult for me.  I don't look for a stream of Digital Bard or gender-changing leads (""JLo IS Macbeth!""), but this one works.  By embracing and amplifying the unnatural elements of the play, Julie Taymor manages to clarify and accelerate the human plot line.  Even for those of us with relatively closed minds, this production ranks as must-see Shakespeare.",1408665600,6,2185,4.875338753387534

4429443,4,B004M9ZI0M,"This adaptation of The Tempest was panned by critics and has a low rating on IMDB, so I didn't expect much from it. But hey - I liked it a lot.

The cast, in particular, is great. Helen Mirren gives a commanding performance as Prospera, the comedy characters work well, and Djimon Hounsou is a powerful Caliban. The one sticking point is Reeve Carney's flat performance as Ferdinand - although that character never interests me much, no matter who is playing him.

I enjoyed the visuals, too, even though they've attracted much criticism. Julie Taymor made a wise decision to film on location at a remote, rather stark Hawaiian island, and the results are impressive. In terms of the special effects, the depiction of Ariel as a morphing, ghostlike figure is very effective - and the lamer effects are easily forgiven, given the film's relatively low budget.

The DVD, meanwhile, comes with a lot of cool special features. The main one is a long, very detailed making-of documentary that addresses casting, production challenges, and the tricky process of adapting Shakespeare to film. There are also two commentaries, one by Taymor and a very interesting alternative one by Shakespeare scholars. I certainly learned a lot about the critical perspective on the play, and its place within the Shakespearean canon.

So...don't ask me why this got bad reviews! A fair number of critics dismissed this adaptation as mere sound and fury, and claimed that it doesn't present an interesting new ""reading"" of the play. But I disagree; for the most part, I enjoyed Taymor's over-the-top directing style, which only occasionally annoyed me by taking on music-video qualities. And I do think this is a compelling new reading of the play; certainly, casting a woman in the lead role is an interesting innovation. Anyway, don't take the critics' word on this one; it's worth seeing for yourself.",1406764800,3,1882,4.984076433121019

4429448,5,B004M9ZI0M,"Internet Rule #63: For every male character there is a female version. No exceptions.

Technically, Shakespeare predates the Internet. But in the case of Julie Taymor's dark, swirling adaptation of ""The Tempest,"" this rule applies -- the legendary wizard Prospero becomes Prospera, played by the peerless Helen Mirren. The gender-flip does give the character a subtle feminist quality, but the story actually remains mostly unchanged -- and definitely supported by a solid cast, a bleak island, and some lovely special effects.

Many years ago, the Duchess of Milan Prospera (Mirren) was left the care of the city by her late husband. But her treacherous brother Antonio (Chris Cooper) accuses her of witchcraft, and exiles her and her daughter Miranda to sea.

Now Prospera dwells on a remote island with the teenaged Miranda (Felicity Jones), as well as the rebellious slave Caliban (Djimon Hounsou) and the ethereal Ariel (Ben Whishaw). When she discovers that Antonio and his similarly treacherous friends are nearby on a sailing ship, Prospera summons a storm that causes the ship to crash on the island, and has Ariel guide them all there.

Like a puppet-master, Prospera arranges events as she wants -- she sends Ariel to haunt the men who betrayed her, allows Caliban to get up to wacky hijinks with a pair of drunken idiots (Alfred Molina, Russell Brand), and even pretends to treat the young prince Ferdinand (Reeve Carney) badly while secretly matchmaking him with Miranda. In the end, everything will be as she desired.

Gender-flipping Prospero apparently wasn't for some kind of feminist point -- it was simply that director Julie Taymor couldn't think of a male actor she wanted in the role. The only Prospero she could think of was Helen Mirren. And it actually works pretty well -- consider as the explanation for Prospera's banishment being accusations of witchcraft, a claim often made against women of power and intelligence. And her return to Milan is symbolized by her abandoning her flowing sorceress' robes in favor of a tight, rigid corset.

Furthermore, it doesn't change the character much -- the fierce cold intelligence, the manipulations, and the fierce love for Miranda are intact. Helen Mirren doesn't soften up her acting or play into any sexist stereotypes -- her Prospera is all swirling power, anger and determination, able to threaten Ariel with imprisonment in a tree in one scene, and tenderly say that she loves him ""dearly"" in another.

And the rest of the cast is pretty awesome as well -- Hounsou, David Strathairn, Alan Cumming, Cooper and the rest give solid smaller performances, and Brand and Molina are excellent as the idiotic comic relief (""Oh, defend me!""). Carney doesn't work as Ferdinand, though -- he's such a wispy, feminine presence that it's hard to see him as Miranda's knight in shining armor.

But the greatest supporting role is Ben Whishaw as the androgynous Ariel -- his passionate acting and the special effects turn Ariel into a wispy, darting creature of moonlight transparency. Whishaw especially seems to be having fun when Ariel torments the ship with fire and wind, or transforms into a black-feathered harpy jeering at the stranded men.

The entire movie takes place on a dusty, stony island that looks like it recently popped up from a volcanic eruption -- in other words, a perfect blank canvas. While Taymor gives suitable attention to the comedy, she's most at home with the dark, swirling magic around Prospera -- spinning magical symbols, the shape-shifting Ariel (costumes and CGI), and a kaleidoscopic spell of dancing air sprites and whispered Shakespearean text. It's mesmerizing.

""The Tempest"" has a few weak spots, but mostly it's a darkly enchanting story of magic, love and manipulation -- and the changing of the lead character's gender doesn't change it at all. A fascinating Shakespeare adaptation.",1403481600,,3888,5.108661417322835

Instead, what a great delight it was to find that this interpretation does what all decent performances of Shakespeare should do: illuminate some aspect of the characters' personalities or some part of their motivations that may not have been as clear to us before.  This film does that exceptionally well.  Admittedly, it doesn't emphasize some of the story elements that I am accustomed to enjoying the most about The Tempest; but as an example of enlightening the viewer, what Helen Mirren's Prospera reveals about some of Prospero's concerns and aspirations for his daughter is something I suspect Shakespeare probably intended but no male actors have fully brought to the role before.

 I saw The Tempest (2010 ) at the Berlin International Film Festival. It was a terrible film.

Julie Taymor is not a very proficient film director, of course she has talent to make a few segments stunningly beautiful, as if in a play or a theatrical performance, but the severity of William Shakespeare's play is lost in a muddled and fabricated palette of inconsistently stupid and vapid CGI. William Shakespeare does not need elaborate and idiotic fake graphics to tell his stories. His words are as powerful as when they were written.

4429486,4,B004M9ZI0M,"The Tempest directed by Julie Taymor (2010) is a very well done and enjoyable movie. Just it is too bad that the directors, of this and other Shakespeares adaptations, cannot help but to try to bend the plots so they would fit into their own personal beliefs or preferred concepts. In the case of The Tempest, an attempt is made to indicate that Caliban is liberated from Prospera. Calibans episode is an apparent reference to the colonization of the New World.
Shakespeares plays have an outward and inner content. Therefore, it may be said that they have a built-in ambiguity. The outward content includes a whole spectrum of human endeavours, e.g., sociology, philosophy, religion, politics, psychology, history, mysticism, arts, etc., etc. Therefore, each play may be interpreted in accordance with a set of assumptions used in these various fields of intellectual and emotional inquiry. Depending on a particular assumption, one may arrive at different interpretations of a play or an episode. This sort of outward interpretations can be easily recognized, because (i) they can be applied only to a selected play or an episode, and (ii) require exclusions or modifications of some parts of the original text. This built-in ambiguity is deliberate. Its purpose is to help the audience to identify all sorts of intellectual and emotional conditioning that prevent them from recognizing the operation of more subtle evolutionary forces.
The inner content of Shakespeares plays is based on a unique design. This design is governed by a set of rules of an evolutionary process that is not limited by intellectual or emotional barriers; neither its operation is limited by time or space. At this level all scenes and episodes of all Shakespeares plays converge into a coherent narrative.
According to this inner narrative, Caliban is of European origin. The particular faculty symbolically represented by Caliban was formed in the past. Namely, Caliban is a result of the fiasco of the Roman evolutionary cycle described in Shakespeares Roman plays. The link is indicated in Titus Andronicus, the concluding play of the Roman plays.
In his conversation with Ariel, Prospero indicates that he knows the origin of Calibans mother. This is why Prospero, an Italian Duke, declares:
  This thing of darkness! Acknowledge mine.
This particular faculty is spiritually distractive:
  He is as disproportiond in his manners
As in his shape.
This faculty has to be subdued to a more advanced aspect of the human mind, if evolutionary progress is to be made. Prospero represents such an advanced aspect. In other words, Caliban cannot be liberated. This particular faculty may only be reformed in such a way as to become completely obedient to the advanced aspect. And this is exactly what Shakespeare indicates:
  Go, sirrah, to my cell;
  Take with you your companions; as you look
  To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
The above two quotes are crucial to understanding the character of Caliban (The audience watching Taymors production may note that these two quotes have been cut off from the movie).
At the end of the play Caliban clearly declares what his role is:
  How fine my master is!
Therefore, any attempts of presenting The Tempest in the context of post-colonial theories are baseless and misrepresent the intent of the play.",1384041600,,3331,5.136783733826248

4429494,4,B004M9ZI0M,"I like to read, maybe more than the average person these days.  But probably much less than a truly well-read man.  That may not be much to say, but I think it useful to know something of the qualifications of a internet comment.  Not knowing much better, I've tried to emphasize the titles considered ""essential reading"".  As I've gotten older, I've been able to revisit some literature for additional experience.  But I'm no scholar or Shakespeare expert.  I've read most of his plays, and enjoy the challenge of the language ""puzzles"".  This age we live in where we can search the internet for filmed adaptations of books we enjoy is entertaining and sometimes educational.  So the online reviews are something I enjoy reading.

I recently ""re-read"" The Tempest, and then saw there was a fairly new film adaptation.  I became a fan of Helen Mirren many years ago when ""Excaliber"" was a new movie.  I enjoyed the recent film adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Northanger Abbey"" with Felicity Jones.  And I figured the supernatural elements of The Tempest would make a good ""blue-ray, home theatre"" movie.

I'm pleased with the investment I made.  The movie was entertaining.  Worth watching a second time, with subtitles ON, to confirm the faithfulness of the dialog to the original source.  Worth watching the bonus documentary describing the production of the film.  Worth owning for some future evening to watch again.  I think it must be hard to remain as accurate as possible to the play as it was written, and also satisfy the average movie watcher who's been shaped by the more popular film titles of the past 30 or so years.  I'm glad to find any adaptation of classic literature that remains basically faithful, so I give this film some consideration on that score, even if I hadn't thought it very good.

But I thought it was pretty good...very good maybe.  Not GREAT, but I can't say exactly why not.  And certainly not deserving of any poor opinion from me.  Themes of forgiveness, release, freedom to grow, are all represented.  I thought the visualization of Caliban (the slave) was very good.  His film presence was the strongest of all characters, which I didn't catch as a reader.  From a purely love of beauty perspective (superficial man values), I think Felicity Jones (Miranda) is very attractive, and also innocently appealing.  Helen Mirren is more my age, and has remained as handsome as one could ever hope for.  In this film, she's depicted as a weather-beaten, island survivor, and then also as a well-preserved, healthy senior queen.  I'm attracted to her in both states.  There's an irony (to me anyway) that as an actor, she's survived and succeeded in an industry that places so much emphasis on youth.  In the play/movie, her character also survives to eventual maturity and triumph.  The other actors were also good.  I really have no complaint at all about this movie.  The dialog of the Shakespeare play is famous, particularly the final epilogue, which can be interpreted as Prospero/Prospera, or in my understanding, as Shakespeare's request of his reader.  Adapted to music, this prayer is presented during the film ending credits.  I thought it was particularly effective, and recommend anyone who watches the film to be prepared by reading the text, or turning on the closed caption.

4429496,5,B004M9ZI0M,"I have seen only one other filmed version of ""The Tempest"", the BBC version, and I agree with others who say that in spite of a good cast lead by great Shakespearean actor, Michael Hordern, it is flat and visually uninteresting. That is a good place to start when speaking of this film, shot on two Hawaiian islands, including the volcanic regions on the big island. The scenery is gorgeous and perfectly befitting the play. The landscape tends to put the humans in proper perspective. Little.

The great background is enhanced by a touch of special effects, especially in the presentation of the spirit, Ariel. In the background piece, it was reported that Ben Whishaw, the actor who played Arial, would not be available when the company went to Hawaii. So, many of his parts are inserted by special effect, which has the benefit of giving him a very spectral quality.

If the special effects and the landscape do anything unfortunate, it is to shrink Prospera in comparison. Either though direction, camera work, or acting, Prospera the magician simply does not come off with the gravitas of Gandalf in LOTR (even though he rarely uses magic.) Prospera's effects are spectacular. It almost seems as if Prospera were played by an even slighter actress, the contrast would have been so great as to make a strong impression.

Caliban is Ariel's opposite, earthy in the extreme. In the BBC production, the Caliban character was covered with a stringy, weedy costume which tended to obscure his reactions to the camera. You can almost recognize Djimon Hounsou as the Nubian who played Russell Crowe's fellow gladiator in the movie of that name. Between his natural skin color and makeup, it appears he is caked with mud.

Caliban's two henchmen from the storm-tossed ship are two of Shakespeare's great fool characters, Trinculo and Stefano, played to perfection by Russell Brand and Alfred Molina. It just may be that this trio steals the show from Mirren. But Mirren gives a great performance, outdoing Hordern easily. As director Julie Taymor notes, it was simple to change the male character Prospero to Prospera, as it was no more than changing a few pronouns. Far, far easier, for example, than changing King Lear or Hamlet to a woman.

The love interest is played by Reeve Carney as Ferdinand, Alonso's son, who falls in love with Miranda, Prospera's daughter, played by felicity Jones. Like many of Shakespeare's romances, they tend to be less interesting than the fools and the perils of the plot. Neither seem accomplished actors, although they carry their parts reasonably well, in this, one of the Himalayas  of English language theatre.

The four noblemen are played well by Chris Cooper as Antonio, Prospera's brother and Miranda's uncle, Alan Cumming as Sebastian - Alonso's brother, Tom Conti as Gonzalo, a counselor to Alonso, who gave aid to Prospera and Miranda
David Strathairn as Alonso, King of Naples, but I confess, Shakespeare has saved the best parts for the fools and the young lovers.

The overall effect makes this possibly the only Tempest worth watching.

One yearns to see what The Tempest would look like with Ian McKellen in the lead, after his long run as that most famous wizard, Gandalf.",1373587200,4,3221,4.928044280442805

4429505,4,B004M9ZI0M,"""The Tempest."" A film by Julie Taymor, starring Helen Mirren, 2011
 First, let me say that I find Prospero regendered into Prospera a marvelous idea, and can think of no one better to play it than Helen Mirren. For about twenty minutes, I was ready to welcome this production into the list of my all-time favorite Shakespeare movies.
 Why, then, do I give it only four stars?
 I found everyone in the cast excellent and the special effects stunning -- many of them at least as beautiful as the ones in the 1935 Midsummer Night's Dream. Another confession: ""The Tempest"" is so far from being among my favorite Shakespeare plays that I actually know the Dryden & Davenant version better, so the fact that this new movie follows Shakespeare's original less than idolatrously does not, in itself, bother me a bit. I never heard a clump of words that sounded unBardlike, so the adaptation worked very smoothly -- except, perhaps, when it interpolated ""Oh, Mistress Mine"" (from Twelfth Night) for Ferdinand to sing to Miranda, who could not by any stretch of the imagination be said to look as old as ""two and twenty.""
 With each and every aspect -- performances, cinematography, script, and special effects -- excellent in and of itself, why didn't the total effect satisfy me?
 Perhaps what was missing was any kind of light touch. While respecting the argument that Taymor's is a legitimate vision of Shakespeare's play, I found it a rather grim and heavy-handed vision, dark in mood as well as lighting effects, and faintly lugubrious even in what scenes and characters might have served as comic relief. There were times when I wondered whether I was watching Shakespeare's magical masque, or Harry Potter's deathly last struggle with Voldemort. It left me, not with the rich feeling of thoughtful and poetic beauty -- whether of merry comedy, cathartic tragedy, or fairy-tale romance -- that I usually bring away from seeing Shakespeare performed, but with a sense of vague discontent and unfilled emptiness. At least, it did so on first viewing; and whether I will ever gather courage for a second viewing, remains to be seen.
 Perhaps I should also mention, just in case there is anything to the theory that sensitivity to impending events can affect our moods, that within twenty-four hours after viewing this DVD, I was among the evacuees fleeing my area's worst forest fire in more than thirty years. (Fortunately for me, they got it contained several miles north of my home.)
 In any case, there is far too much good stuff in this movie not to recommend it.",1368835200,4,2563,4.837899543378995

The problem arises when the kids read the play and then have to wrap their minds around the significant differences resulting from substituting a female lead for the male lead that Shakespeare created originally. Helen Mirren is wonderful in the role, and I have loved her performances for some time. However, kids tend to struggle with the change. I spent some time reminding them of the essential relationships of parent and child, and that they need not be gender specific. While that may be helpful in daily living, it is somewhat confusing when a sixteen-year-old is trying to sort out those relationships in the context of Shakespeare's language and dramatic structure.",1366416000,,813,4.985294117647059

4429516,3,B004M9ZI0M,"I'll begin by saying that anything directed by Julie Taymor is automatically going to be more creative and provocative than most of the films being produced.

Taymor's striking style-- extravagant sets and costumes, anachronistic contrasts between story and setting, a preference for in-camera effects rather than CGI--has been ebbing bit by bit, which is quite unfortunate. Her version of Shakespeare's Titus is perfect, and her biopic of Frida Kahlo is gorgeous and heart-achingly acted.

Now we have the screen version of The Tempest, which Taymor has directed on stage to great praise in the past. The choice to make Prospero female, and casting Helen Mirren in the role, is intriguing. Mirren's performance lacks power, unfortunately, but it's still HELEN FREAKING MIRREN as Prospero.

This is the pattern in Taymore's Tempest: wildly talented people who are not at their best. Alan Cumming, Alfred Molina, etc., simply not at their best. Perhaps there were behind the scenes issues with the producers.

For another matter, the cast includes Russell Brand, who may be fitting for gross-out frat-boy comedies, but Shakespeare? I'd rather watch ice melt. He plays one of the clown roles opposite Alfred Molina (who was stunning in Frida), and the pair are terribly mismatched in every way. Once Djimon Honsou's (well-played) Caliban is added, the three mostly just goof off rather than actually create comic relief.

The love story between Miranda and the Prince is incidental, but isn't it usually?

And there's so much CGI that it turns into a video game by the end.

Is it ""bad""? Heck no. I'd watch it again. But I probably wouldn't purchase it. It's just not great, and I am quite disappointed to see lackluster work from a director I've adored until recently.",1363219200,,1767,5.093425605536332
4429517,5,B004M9ZI0M,"The role of Prospero has now become Prospera, so Shakespeare's tale is now slightly tweaked to be a mother/daughter tale.  The setting, being a rather barren island allows the viewer to focus on the story itself rather than lots of visual clutter, although there are excellent FX scenes for eye candy.  The costumes are wonderfully done, and more than appropriate to the theme.

It is a shame that this excellent production apparently went nowhere in the box office, leaving me to wonder if the film distributor and marketing people did their part.  This certainly deserves to be seen by a wider audience.",1362873600,,605,4.901960784313726

4429524,4,B004M9ZI0M,"""The Tempest"" is a well-acted version of Shakespeare's play and gets a lot of benefit from the varied land- and sea-scapes of Lanai and the Big Island of Hawaii.  The actors deliver their lines in as close to a natural rhythm as works well, avoiding the sing-song of lesser productions or the whooping over-playing of some well-known actors.  Helen Mirren as Prospera and Ben Whishaw as Ariel were especially good.  The cliffs, lava formations, crashing waves, dense forests, wind actions, and colorful empty, rocky lands all add to the realization of Shakespeare's vision.  It is an enjoyable way to see ""The Tempest"" displayed.

The play was originally intended to let the audience while away a four-hour afternoon in the theater.  Cutting it down to 110 minutes involves some choices on how much of each plot strand to add to the mix.  The result seemed all right to me.

The decision to have Shakespeare's Prospero played by a woman, becoming Prospera, might have appealed to Shakespeare himself.  After all, there was some recent history for him to draw from.  When Henry VIII's son, King Edward VI, died in 1553, the deal was that his replacement was to be Lady Jane Grey.  A political coup resulted in Henry VIII's daughter becoming Queen Mary I, with Lady Jane Grey losing her head.  Although Queen Mary I pushed hard to restore Roman Catholicism, she was succeeded by Queen Elizabeth I who had a long, popular reign, keeping her father's Anglican faith as the state religion.  It is easy to map these three queens into an acceptable-for-Shakespeare-at-the-time Prospera, who was deposed as Duchess of Milan, who reacted against changes by pushing black magic too far, and who then lapsed back into power as her natural, regal currently-unwed self.

This version of ""The Tempest"" is well worth watching.",1356998400,2,1811,4.953642384105961
4429525,5,B004M9ZI0M,Helen Mirren is truly of the greatest Shakespearean thespian's of our time.  This is a must see performance in a world of media that has all but forgotten Shakespeare and 'grown flat and unprofitable'.  This is a true revival of the immortal barb's imagination.  True lovers of good theater should learn to enjoy something unique. Great dialogue Shakespearian poetry and morals matched with stunning special effects make Helen Mirren's performance the best she has ever done.  Don't miss this performance.

The characters are very well cast, the pacing is good, and the film captures a lot of what I love about the play. There are some odd artistic choices, such as the incidental music at times, and some of the cuts made from the play to the film give a less complex view of Propera, making her more sympathetic by eliminating some of the darker qualities in the character from the play.

4429538,3,B004M9ZI0M,"This is Julie Taymor's second attempt at a Shakespeare film. ""Titus"" was an obscure work that she performed visual wonders with. But she could not make up for the bad story of the play itself. This time she goes after ""The Tempest"" which has the opposite problem. Its a great piece of writing, but its difficult (if not impossible) to successfully adapt it to film.

Its not that its bad. Its ""ok"" in the same way that previous adaptations have been ok. Its not a work that lends itself to Taymor's particular skills and she seems too respectful of the play to take real chances with it. And she was probably right in the reaction to her taking chances with it would have been extremely negative from most.

She changed the gender of Prospero (now Prospera). But thats nothing special. Vanessa Redgrave did it over a decade ago and did it better. Whatever Helen Mirren's strengths as an actress, she isn't really suited to the part in my opinion. She could work as Queen Lear, but Prospera just doesn't fit to me. Djimon Hounsou as Caliban is a disaster. He doesn't have the acting experience to pull off what is a very critical part. Russell Brand works but only because he is doing a limited supporting character suited to his skills.

The acting in the film is rather disjointed. There is no unifying style or vision to it from a dramatic point of view. I would suspect (but can't know) that the director let the actors go their own way for the most part.

The music wasn't bad. The visuals were ok for the most part but not up to whats expected of Taymor. I give her credit for taking on (again) a difficult Shakespeare work that many would shy away from. Credit where it is due, by the low standards of Tempest adaptations, she has done very well.

My initial reaction was one star but during the course of writing the review I changed my mind (twice!) finally giving it three stars. In the end, its flaws to me are more the various limitations of the people involved in creating it and that of great ambition.",1344384000,6,2015,4.479564032697548
4429539,5,B004M9ZI0M,"A Moving interpretation with Helen Mirren in the lead.  The film's pace and tone and imagery allows Shakespeare's story to unfold within its own mystery and mysticism.  Taymor reads the plot as a ritual of redemption and reclamation.  Casting Mirren as the dispossessed regent seems to recall a primeval epoch,  and through its ancient magic restore the now wizened goddess queen (see Robert Graves' ""The White Goddess"") to her rightful seat.  Perhaps not Shakespeare's exact intention, but certainly an exploration of treachery, usurpation, and a return to power . . . and here through the marriage of the present to the ancient.  A bold and intelligent undertaking, cosmically connected and beautifully wrought.  It's too easy to use Shakespeare to make superficial connections to contemporary events and sensibilities; it is much harder to make manifest Shakespeare's nearly synaptic display of human patterns and movements. Einstein saw the universe without; Shakespeare watched it work within. Taymor has tapped that vein. She works on a different level than Kenneth Branagh, and I thank the spirits for both.",1344211200,4,1114,5.367816091954023
4429540,5,B004M9ZI0M,"I used to think that ""The Tempest"" read better than it played.

This movie proved me wrong.  Yes, all the lovely poetry is there, but the production sparkles.

Casting Prospero as Prospera was a brainwave.  Prospero's crustiness and wordiness and sheer grumpiness are softened, making him--here, her--a likable character at last.  And not only likable, but sympathetic.  Helen Mirren does a great job with difficult lines--mainly by plowing straight ahead and letting the sense come as it will.

The rest of the cast is equally good.  David Straithairn is perfect as Alonso, the sad, almost morose King of Naples.  Chris Cooper is believably Machiavellian as Prospera's brother Antonio, who stole her dukedom long ago.  The wonderful Alan Cumming is great as Alonso's treacherous (though not very bright) brother.

Felicity Jones is suitably dewy as Miranda, and Reeve Carney is unbelievably young and perfect for Ferdinand.

Russell Brand, Alfred Molina, and Djimon Hounsou practically steal the show as Trinculo, Stephano, and Caliban.

But the best thing about this production--and that's saying a lot--is the setting.  The whole thing is gorgeous and suitably magical, from the lava rocks and swamps and barrens of the island to the wonderful cave and magic pool of Prospera.  Ben Whishaw is great as Ariel, but even better are the leaping special effects that make him androgynous, and transform him from sweet spirit to horrible harpy.

The one, minor, false note is the animated Hounds of Hell.  But this is negligible.

All in all, a splendid rendition.  If you like the play--and even if you don't--you will love this version.",1339804800,4,1635,5.14828897338403
4429541,5,B004M9ZI0M,"I had never seen a woman play the role of Prospero/Prospera before - but, if anyone could pull it off, Mirren's the one. (Following her lead, I heard of a regional theatre casting Olympia Dukakis in the role, another strong choice.) Maybe some purists might balk at the shift. Really, though, the themes of power and control are human themes, irrespective of the man or woman who wields them. If anything, the mother/daughter relationship with Miranda added sensitivity that the usual father/daughter interaction has trouble carrying. And, when Prospera's exile from Milan comes up, it seems especially credible a woman in power would be a prime target for the old boys' club of political potentates. The choice of Djimon Hounsou as Caliban added a complex edge to the role, too. Casting a black as Prospera's slave evokes some shameful episodes of history, at the same time it gives hope that we've moved past them. (Perhaps that's what keeps Shakespeare's work timeless: its ability to absorb and play back the issues unique to each era.)

Production values were all you could hope for - magnificent scenes of stark, rocky shores being the most memorable. In a move not often asssociated with Shakespeare, Julie Taymor's direction added some amount of special effects. Although meaningful, they came across as less than special, possibly more of a distraction than an addition. I won't let that interfere with enjoying this movie, though. It really does render The Tempest in beautiful and thought-provoking ways.

4429544,5,B004M9ZI0M,"I've seen Shakespeare performed live several times, and seen several movie adaptations.  My first comment is that you have to *see* Shakespeare rather than read his work.  But even so, most productions border on the lifeless and melodramatic.  This version of The Tempest was alive... using visual effects that Shakespeare undoubtedly dreamed of but could never hope to produce on a stage.

This was a visual treat... AND it was very well acted.  I never heard a line of dialog spoken that sounded stiff or ""read"".  Much to my surprise, I even thought Russell Brand did a very nice job in one of the comic roles.

And what can be said about Helen Mirren?  She rocked it!  I am a new fan.  The only other Shakespeare movie that can be said to have been so well done is Romeo + Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio.  And maybe third place is Much Ado About Nothing with Kenneth Brannagh.

The Tempest -- great movie!",1330646400,2,907,4.565217391304348

4429546,4,B004M9ZI0M,"As a Shakespeare fan, I was elated to read that Julie Taymor was planning a film version of THE TEMPEST. If she could turn a minor work like TITUS ANDRONICUS into a thrilling film, imagine what she could do with Shakespeare's last truly great play! The movie opened in December 2010 -- and then disappeared. No further distribution. Released on DVD late and without fanfare. Even an episode of ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" based on Taymor's troubles with the Spiderman musical, which referred to her last film as a flop. Not good signs . . .
While Taymor's version has its flaws, it is still worth watching. First and foremost, for the Prospera of Helen Mirren, who gives a performance of power, range and nuance. A close second is Ben Wishaw's creation of Ariel, enhanced by Taymor's creative use of special effects. The part of Miranda might have been written for newcomer Felicity Jones. And, in a brilliant touch, the play's epilogue is rendered hauntingly in song, played behind the end credits. Finally, as one has come to expect of Taymor's films, all of the visual elements -- costumes, settings, photography -- reflect a carefully integrated realization of the play's themes.
One of my tests of a filmed version of a play is: are there moments I passed over in reading that come alive in viewing? Two examples come to mind from this video: the old counselor Gonzalo (Tim Conti) is played for comedy -- a sententious windbag like Polonius; and the temptation scene between Antonio (Chris Cooper) and Sebastian (Alan Cumming,) which has a wonderfully sinister feel to it.
There are some mis-steps as well. Russell Brand is a marvelous performer; but he cannot, in even the remotest sense, be said to act. Miranda is a sparkling creature; but her Ferdinand (Reeve Carney) is bland both in presence and line delivery. The conclusion of the comic subplot belongs in a cartoon.
This version is, as a previous reviewer noted, better than previous attempts but ultimately unsatisfying -- I think due to problems with pacing and proportion. Propera's scenes seem rushed, while Miranda's are lingered over. Ariel and Caliban need to be seen as forces of equal strength, but the CGI emphasis on Ariel renders him a minor character.
For a fully realized production of THE TEMPEST, I recommend the CBC's DVD of the 2010 Stratford Shakespeare Festival production with Christopher Plummer. It is no slight to Ms. Mirren's considerable talents to say that this is a part Plummer was born to play.",1328918400,,2491,4.877358490566038

I was able to watch this version with the subtitles and thoroughly enjoyed the genius of The Bard. The language is old, but the musical background has been updated. Great performances. I would love to see a series of Shakespeare done this way, although let's keep the genders intact next time. Mirren was fantastic as were the CG effects.

While I am usually something of a Shakespeare purist, I thought the transformation of Prospero into Prospera was inspired, linking Prospero/Prospera's exile to false accusations of witchcraft and introducing a mother-daughter relationship into the story.  The magical elements on which Shakespeare depends to advance his plot are brilliantly imagined and presented by Julie Taymor, with a translucent and shape-changing Ariel.  Shakespeare's language (some of his best) comes across beautifully, and with an intimacy that can be difficult to achieve on stage.  There is wonderful chemistry between the characters (Prospera-Ariel, Miranda-Ferdinand, etc), and most of the scenes draw added power from the dramatic Hawaiian landscapes on which they are filmed.  The action is well paced, with the film lasting an hour and fifty minutes (short for Shakespeare).  We are lucky to have such an engaging and imaginative film of The Tempest.  I sincerely hope that Julie Taymor will have the opportunity to film more of Shakespeare's plays.

The Tempest is on my favorite plays.  Helen Mirren is one of the greatest actresses of our times and I was excited to hear that she had been cast as Prospera.

It was so promising!  Unfortunately, the actual film is a total disappointment.  This is one of the worst productions of Shakespeare that I have ever seen.

The story is set on an island.  The story offers the perfect opportunity for lush tropical settings.  The producers of this film must have searched high and low for a particularly uninteresting area of coastline.  Visually this film is very dull and unappealing.

I've seen better staging in a theater.  The Tempest is about magic.  The staging of this film is unimaginative.  There is no magic in the production, making the story pointless.

I generally have no problem with Shakespearean language or with British accents.  And yet I had huge issues comprehending what the actors were saying in large sections of the dialog in this film.  Quite a few of them sound like they are mumbling.

Unfortunately, this is the kind of dreary production that turns people off of Shakespeare.  Watching this left me sad and disappointed.",1326672000,14,1290,4.7040358744394615

Her interpretation of The Tempest brings both the beautiful and unexpected to Shakespeare's masterpiece. I've never seen a completely satisfying production of this play on film or video. Despite the efforts of fine actors and directors who've attempted it, the visual aspect of past productions could never match Shakespeare's exquisite language. Julie Taymor's completely individual VISCERAL sense of design and movement, as well as Elliot Goldenthal's musical score, are genius. They illuminate Shakespeare's text and the masterful performances of the cast with true insight and magical delight. Not to be missed. The Tempest and Taymor's earlier film of Titus are far and above my favorite interpretations of the Bard's work.

  A spectacular, stunning display of wonder unfolded before our eyes. Even the proper use of the English language was not a barrier for my daughters, to understand this play of the master, Shakespeare. The music was otherworldly, transporting the spirit, as the story came alive, weaving its magic before our eyes.
  For me, this will be the role of a lifetime for Helen Mirren. She brought to life the gifted sorceress. Her acting was bold and powerful, and at the right moments, soft & tender. Her magical spirit Uriel was played to perfection by Ben Whishaw.

So I was eager for a new version of ""The Tempest,"" and I wasn't able to catch this one in the theaters since it never played near where I live. Unfortunately nearly all of the reviews I had read of this version were decidedly mixed. Still, I wasn't going to let them keep me from seeing it. Well, I'm really glad I bought it because it's *much* better than the mixed reviews had led me to believe. Helen Mirren's excellent interpretation of ""Prospero"" as ""Prospera"" strikes me as quite natural -- that is, it doesn't come across as a trendy gender-switching gimmick -- and most of the other actors are superb as well. The ""special effects,"" particularly with Ariel, are effectively handled. My only reservation, in fact, has to with Djimon Hounsou's performance as Caliban. He himself is, I believe, very good, but his strong accent sometimes makes it difficult to understand Caliban's speeches, which include some of the loveliest, most touching in the play.

Adaptations I can live with, but trying to patch an article of such disparate elements which vacillates from moment to moment between the two distant worlds of 17th century England and 21st century America made me feel a little too queasy. Stir into the cooking pot acting that also vacillated between the aforementioned cultures and it was a quick trip to the bathroom.

Having survived that I will say that the interpretation had it's creative moments especially with the, although overdone, CGI effects as well as the body art, props and costumes. The Hawaiian island geography helped to sustain this viewer's interest through what seemed to be, at times, overboard rambling acting and at other times just bland, memorize the lines, acting. Overall, to the production crew's defense, they did well for a limited budget and a strange menu mix. Unfortunately, more forgettable than memorable.",1324857600,2,1144,5.217391304347826
4429556,4,B004M9ZI0M,"This was Shakespeare's final play, and it appears he broke with traditional play formats to develop underlying themes implied throughout his previous plays.  As such, the plot and character development prevalent in earlier plays is minimized in The Tempest.  That carries over into this film, making it initially difficult to follow.  On the other hand, this film makes it obvious that a major character in The Tempest, the deserted island setting, cannot be captured on stage.  This is more a screenplay than a stage play, and now we finally have an appropriate treatment of this essential work.
  The casting is outstanding.  We are presented with multiple characters in short order, but there is no problem telling them apart.  The lead character Prospero is played as a female Prospera by Helen Mirren, who comes across as a Queen Lear, showing what could have happened in a sequel if Lear and daughter had been exiled rather than killed.  All the other characters bring substantial stage cred to their roles.  And then there's Russell Brand, who as in all his projects leaves the viewer wondering, ""What the hell was that?""
  Any Shakespeare afficionado needs to see this.  In all his previous plays we have appreciated his insight into the deficiencies, tumultuous condition and redemptive efforts of mankind.  But in this play we have Miranda, who has grown up outside human society, on first observing a cross-section of scoundrels, exclaiming, ""O wonder.  How many goodly creatures are there here.  How beautious mankind is.  O brave new world that has such people in it.""  This play is an exposition of, within the magic of our own supressed powers, what we have lost but may rediscover.

Having earned two Tony Awards for directing the stage musical of ""The Lion King"" and well-known for her costume design and puppetry for plays such as ""The Tempest"", ""Oedipus Rex"", ""The Magic Flute"" and was also the production consultant and designer for Michael Jackson's ""This Is It"" concert show.

But when it comes to directing films, Taymor is best known for directing the 1999 film ""Titus"" and the 2007 film ""Across the Universe"".

But in 2010, Taymor returned to her roots, her passion for Shakespeare and to create the film adaptation of the William Shakespeare play ""The Tempest"", considered to be the last play that Shakespeare had written alone.  And many consider it to be a play that would incorporate themes from other Shakespearean plays such as romance, comedy, drama and other sources.

The 2010 film is loosely based on ""The Tempest"" as the lead character Prospera (played by Helen Mirren, ""Queen"", ""Excalibur"", ""Calendar Girls"", ""National Treasure"") is played by a woman and not a man (who goes by the name of Prospero). And in the play, Prospero is the Duke of Milan but for this film, Prospera is the wife of the Duke.

VIDEO:

""The Tempest"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  And  the film looks absolutely beautiful.  This film also reinforces my belief that nearly every film shot in Hawaii and released on Blu-ray looks magnificent in HD.  The film and the lighting are fantastic.  There is plenty of detail, colors are vibrant and dark when they need to be.

But the cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh (""Bridget Jone's Diary"", ""The Piano"", ""Analyze This""), visual effects, costume and makeup design for the film is fantastic. In fact, possibly the most impressive part of the film is when Prospera calls upon Ariel in his darkest form.  Excellent scene!  Dryburgh has a lot to work with in terms of capturing the look and feel of the island on camera and there are plenty of breathtaking scenes.

I detected no banding, no edge enhancement, no softness.  Picture quality is fantastic!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Tempest"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The back cover mentions English and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, but it appears to be an error possibly meant for the DVD version.  But audio-wise, the lossless audio is fantastic.  There is quite a bit of action throughout the film from various weather elements, the opening scene alone with the chaos in the seas definitely utilizes the center, front, surround channels and LFE.  The overall ambiance is also well captured in the film and if anything, the lossless audio is nothing short of spectacular.

The dialogue is crystal clear and for the most part, audiophiles will find the lossless soundtrack to be quite immersive.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Tempest"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary  - Featuring in-depth commentary by Julie Taymor. Julie is very passionate about Shakespeare and she goes into details of the location, the cast and various scenes.
  Shakespeare Experts Audio Commentary - I found this audio commentary to be a welcome addition to the Blu-ray release as experts Virginia Mason Vaughan (a Professor of English at Clark University) and Jonathan Bate (A Shakespeare Professor at England's University of Warwick)  discuss the differences between the play and the film adaptation.  The two do not engage in any lambasting towards the film but for those that want to know about the key differences, will surely enjoy this commentary.
  Raising the Tempest - (1:06:06) A making-of ""The Tempest"" but also gives you an idea of the location of the film, the cast's state of mind while working on the film and also comparisons of the play and film and more.
  Julie & Cast: Inside the L.A. Rehearsals - (13:34) A featurette in which Julie Taymore along with Russell Brand, Alfred Molina and Djimon Hounsou at a stage rehearsal from back in 2008.
  Russel Brand Rehearsal Riff - (4:32) Julie Taymor interview Trinculo (Brand).
  Music Video - (3:22) Featuring a the music video for ""Mistress Mine"" by actor Reeve Carney.

EXTRAS:

""The Tempest"" comes with a slipcover case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I really wanted to love""The Tempest"" and I know how passionate filmmaker Julie Taymor was when she created it.  And to reaffirm that passion, I listened to the audio commentary, the featurette on the making of this film.  And how she wanted to bring technology and theater together as one.

But the problem is, while visually the film was visceral and gorgeous, the story was not.

And the biggest culprit was the pacing of the film.  The film starts off rather dark, we learn what sacrifices Prospera had gone through to keep she and her daughter safe from intruders.  How she took control of the island and made Caliban, a slave.  And the dynamic between mother and daughter, Prospera and Ariel, Miranda and Ferdinand, I did like.

But the pacing takes a 90 degree turn as the film's comedy diverts you from a more serious/darker tone to ridiculousness as the film begins to focus on Trinculo and Stephano with Caliban.  To put it bluntly, when you start watching Russell Brand trounce into the film, in modern day garb and discovering Calaban, ""The Tempest"" resembles less of a Shakespearan film and almost becomes more of something we would see from Happy Madison or Judd Apatow-produced films.

Is it funny, yes...but it is so out of place and in many ways, it became more of an experimental, jarring part of the film that really takes you out of the actual story.  Yes, we know that Trinculo, Stephano and Caliban would be plotting against Prospera but perhaps the three were focused on too much.

The other story featured Kin Alonzo, Antonio, Sebastian and I felt that while the play shows the conflict between Antonio and Prospero quite well, I felt the necessary bridge to show Antonio's betrayal of Prospera was not well tied together in the film.

But what I did enjoy about the film was relationship between Prospera and Miranda and you have to give credit to the performance of Helen Mirren who did a wonderful job.  Julie Taymor was correct in the fact that a woman can play the role of the lead protagonist and the casting of Mirren was terrific.

As mentioned earlier, the visual effects, cinematography, costume design and makeup were fantastic in this film and to incorporate an experimental and artistic direction for the film can be applauded, it's just that I felt there were scenes, moments that were missing or just out of place.

While the Blu-ray release of ""The Tempest"" will surely be enjoyed by fans, there is no doubt that this film looks and sounds fantastic on Blu-ray and the special features are also lengthy, enlightening and entertaining.  But as far as the film itself, for a visceral film that screams beauty and darkness, unfortunately its disjointed storyline doesn't match the vibrancy of the film's beautiful aesthetics.",1323993600,5,7017,4.918297872340426

4429559,4,B004M9ZI0M,"I confess to reading few of Shakespeare's written works and only one outside of required reading in high school; none of which were The Tempest. Previously, all I've known of it was that it was probably Shakespeare's final play and was made into a film by Derek Jarman in 1979. This latest screen adaptation is directed by Julie Taymor, who previously helmed the Shakespearian film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titus/dp/B000E6ESKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titus</a>. That film received mixed reviews, while The Tempest has had a mostly negative reception. Whether this stems from critics' familiarity with Shakespeare's version or they truly think it's a bad film, I liked it well enough to be inspired to seek out the Bard's work and I found it to be an effective take on the story.

The gender of the main character has been switched to female and presented as Prospera (Helen Mirren), the duchess of Milan, who was cast out of Milan with her young daughter Miranda by her brother Antonio (Chris Cooper). After spending twelve years stranded on an island, Prospera decides the time has come to seek revenge and she causes a tempest that wrecks the ship carrying the King of Naples, Alonzo (David Straitharn), his son, and various subjects including her brother. With the help of a spirit named Ariel (Ben Whishaw), Prospera separates the crew and awaits their arrival.

The film is noticeably beautiful from the opening scene and with film credits like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Across-the-Universe/dp/B002G1K82Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Across the Universe</a>&nbsp;and stage credits that include the Broadway version of The Lion King, it's no secret that Taymor is a visual artist to some degree and her vision of The Tempest is both bold and unique. As the writer and director, she has fashioned an adaptation that sticks closely to the Bard's original words while creating a vision so completely her own. An American director, she brings a distinctly Euro-flavor to the execution and a lot of style without taking away the substance of the story. There is a lot of CGI in The Tempest, some of it striking and some of it laughable, yet it never undermines power of Shakespeare's writing. I am not well-versed in the language of Shakespeare and, as such, I must heap praise upon a movie that draws me in enough to forget that I'm listening to Shakespeare recitation.

This is not a perfect film but its imperfections may have been too closely scrutinized and with all there is to appreciate, The Tempest has gotten a bad rap. The performances, especially from Mirren, really breathe life into the film. Mirren brings a power to her delivery that makes the switch of gender seem like a true creative decision rather than a gimmick and she carries this movie, proving she's one of the great working actresses. Djimon Honsou as Caliban, Prospera's slave, is animated and unconventional. Since his Oscar-nominated work in 2006's Blood Diamond, he hasn't remained prominent but his performance here reminds the audience of the power he can bring to a role. Alonzo's butler Stephano and jester Trinculo are played by Alfred Molina and Russell Brand respectively and provide some uncontrived comic relief. Brand may not seem like an obvious choice, but he adapts to the material naturally and despite a career based on his stand-up inclinations and his work in the comedy genre, he does have a background in stage acting. Brand has attracted a lot of hatred (especially on the internet hate machine), but his Trinculo should silence any doubt that his talent extends outside the comedy genre. Trinculo is not an ultra-dramatic role, but most can attest that simply reading Shakespeare's dialogue convincingly is not an easy task and Brand sounds completely natural with it.

The Tempest is an undeniably stylish film, although some stylistic choices are questionable. The film occasionally dips into the musical genre, with characters singing some of their lines a la Across the Universe. This is a choice that works occasionally, but mostly seems forced and I'd venture to say that the use of music is the biggest flaw, especially in regards to the ill-placed rock music that makes the film feel like a parody of itself. Whenever there's a scene that plays like a bad joke, it seems to spawn from the music within the scene. The use of music and the music used is the biggest flaw without a doubt.

The Tempest couples beautiful writing with beautiful visuals and doesn't look or feel like a mainstream product. It's beautiful to look at and fascinating to watch, a film that has reinvigorated my interest in Shakespeare and has prompted me to seek out The Tempest in its written form. Taymor may not have directed the most faithful, coherent, or perfect adaptation of a Shakespeare work, but she's brought one that adds a little something extra to already proven material. Whether you focus on the words and ignore the visuals or vice-versa, this film is an experience; which is more than many directors could hope to bring to the table. It's hard to recommend this to a certain demographic, as I'm neither a Shakespeare fan nor a non-fan...But this is certainly a production worth checking out.

4429560,4,B004M9ZI0M,"After watching Julie Taymor blathering on about The Tempest, it's difficult to understand why this movie is as good as it is. Well not really -- she hired a fantastic ensemble and the Bard's words took over. The Caliban, Stefano, Ariel, Sebastian, and Antonio are truly outstanding, some of the best performances I've seen in those roles. Miranda is very good, and Ferdinand is good enough to make their scenes work. The supporting roles of Alonso and Gonzalo are serviceable - they don't ruin the scenes that they're in, which is good enough for me. Trinculo isn't that bad. Which leaves us with ""Prospera"".... Helen Miran is a great actress but she drank too much Taymor juice on this one. When the play begins, Prospero is a man with little patience or kindness, consumed with hatred and thoughts of revenge. He has spent decades on an island building his power, enslaving and torturing its inhabitants, and plotting his revenge. And during the course of the play, all his enemies are finally in his power and his hatred is at its peak. Miranda says, ""Never till this day saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.""  That's what the Tempest refers to, and the key to making Prospero (and the overall play) work. Unfortunately Helen and Julie missed that line entirely in their joint effort to make ""Prospera"" seem like such a reasonable person. And if ""Prospera"" is such a reasonable person, then why would she discard the tools of her reasonableness (staff, books) at the end? It just doesn't work and nearly ruins the production. Bottom line - if you love Shakespeare as much as I do, or even just like his work a little, you owe it to yourself to see this performance solely for the Caliban and the Stefano. Sebastian, Antonio, and Ariel are bonuses. Study Prospera to see what not to do when you are cast in that role. The cinematography is good, and the blu-ray transfer is worth paying extra for.",1319500800,3,1907,4.692537313432836

4429562,2,B004M9ZI0M,"I'm conflicted about a two star rating as the director and excellent cast make a brave attempt to be fresh and exciting.

However if rating this from a viewer perspective, it was a big disappointment and barely watchable.

Visual noise, literalism and simplistic read miss much of the impact of the material.

It may work well for high school kids needing to cover the material but who don't want to read it.

If you are familiar with the play or generally like Shakespeare it may miss the mark for you too.",1319328000,8,507,4.538461538461538
4429563,5,B004M9ZI0M,"As my title states, I am not a William Shakespeare fan, sorry but I'm not. Is what it is... However I enjoyed this ""version"" of what is (controversially) considered his last play. There are some character changes such as Prospero being female in this version.

Look, I will admit that I had the subtitles on -why? Though I do that with movies I've viewed over and over, the reason is I could not catch all the nuances without reading along with the characters. The language is 17th century English as it was thought to have been written in 1610 or 1611 -so it is hard to follow for those of us who are used to the bastardized English we speak today. I will also admit I was lost on a few things that were spoken just because I am not used to the expressiveness of the language used in the play and this film.

Visually it's stunning -extremely well filmed -the special effects do not hinder the movie as you really do not notice them as effects but as part of the story and plot.

If you love Shakespeare or literature in general you will enjoy this re-visioned version of his play.",1318723200,3,1082,4.346534653465347
4429564,5,B004M9ZI0M,"Prospera, once the Duke of Milan and sorceress now reigns over a faraway island, living there with her daughter, Miranda. After 12 years of being abandoned she has an opportunity for revenge. However the ships may bring more than she planned on.

It is impossible to have lived in the cinematic world and not come across any the other productions by Julie Taymor. With each of her productions she does not copy but enhances the originals in a unique way. In this case we have quite a few deviations. However as long as you are aware of the original play you can appreciate the deviations. Prospero is replaced by Prospera (Helen Mirren) one of the greatest actresses of our time. Julie's approach is different but does not go off the deep end and re-create a whole new story; as the story is just enhanced by dynamic technology and cinematic capabilities not available in earlier productions. And naturally a mother daughter story will have some different outlook than a father daughter story.

The only drawback is the curt runtime forcing some reduction in dialog and addition of references.

Added plusses of course first include Helen Mirren. Also the location (various untraded locations in Hawaii) is perfect. The underwater or through water scenes gave an ethereal feel.",1318118400,,1277,4.930232558139535
4429565,2,B004M9ZI0M,"I saw this film in Hollywood only because Helen Mirren was doing a Q/A after the film. I will pay to see any film she's in and looked foward to this one. My mistake was that I knew nothing about The Tempest, and for that matter very little about Shakespeare, so I missed a lot of the gags. Anyone who is in the same boat of me will not appreciate this film. I'd highly suggest reading the play before seeing the movie. The people around me who obviously were more familiar with the play seemed to enjoy the show. What I remember most about this movie were the bizarre trippy dreamlike scenes.",1318032000,5,592,4.294642857142857
4429566,4,B004M9ZI0M,"First off I will say I have never seen an adaptation of ""The Tempest"" before so I have nothing to compare it to.  I was somewhat familiar with the Shakespeare story before watching the movie but I will say I liked the movie.  It was slow at first as I had to get used to the Shakespeare language but once I really listened to the dialogue and watched the characters, the movie flowed.  I was amazed at how many great actors and actresses are in the movie - Helen Mirren, Russell Brand, Julie Taymor.

It is a great story of revenge and betrayal and the acting is well portrayed.  If you are going to watch this DVD though just remember it is Shakespearian dialect.  I would think big Shakespeare fans would really like this movie as it seems true to the story.  It is a movie with some neat special effects and one I could watch again.  I think my favorite character was Russell Brand and his uniqueness.",1317254400,,904,4.339285714285714
4429567,5,B004M9ZI0M,"The film is wonderful: a flawless version of the Tempest. I'm glad I got it.

But I'm going to sell this rotten blu-ray disc the second I can get the DVD.

I've waited a year, and I got the blu-ray because I just couldn't stand to wait any longer for the DVD. The film on it is wonderful, but the blu-ray that carries the film is horrible: It fails to load promptly on my old player, and what it does slowly load is bloody awful advertising for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Carribean/dp/B004A8ZWUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Carribean</a>. What junk! The instructions displayed to skip around the advertising (which is not what I paid for) make this blu-ray hang up the player if I tap either of the 2 menu keys it says to use; the third key it doesn't say to tap aborts the junk. The blu-ray usually hangs-up the player on the second feature played, and it always hangs the player when I try to play the 'Los Angeles Rehearsal' feature. And of course, the blu-ray won't re-start where it was when I quit for an hour's break.

The problem is not the player, it's the studio's nasty java-based copy protection software embedded on the blu-ray disc. The recently-purchased David Attenborough '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madagascar/dp/B004PHSTWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madagascar</a>' blu-ray plays with no troubles (no java).

I recommend waiting for the DVD if you can stand it; the film is strikingly visual, but I don't think it needs to be high-res for the beauty of the film to come through. On the other hand, if you only will settle for blu-ray resolution, you can buy my copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-awful-disc/dp/B003Y5H5JM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this awful disc</a>&nbsp;very cheaply once&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tempest-on-DVD/dp/B004M9ZI0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">'The Tempest' on DVD</a>&nbsp;is available.",1317254400,,2061,6.221052631578948
