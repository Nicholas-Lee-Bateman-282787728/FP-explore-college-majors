8431396,5,B004IZJL30,"I love VR and everything they do (did), so I had to get this DVD. I have tons of boots and saw them 4 times when they were active. This is a great DVD that tries to capture the energy and power of a live show. The set list is good and as I remember the sound and visual quality is also good. If you like Slash or Scott, and are a VR fan, this DVD is a must.",1390608000,3,357,3.5316455696202533
8431397,5,B004IZJL30,"This is just a sample of how good they are. They should set aside old grudges and get back together. ""Do it for the kids"".",1383177600,2,122,3.92
8431398,5,B004IZJL30,This is one of those concerts you put in your DVD player & crank. And then spark up a fat one. That's what Rock n Roll is all about. Buy it!,1374537600,3,140,3.5483870967741935
8431399,3,B004IZJL30,"I loved the Libertad album so jumped at the chance to get this DVD when it came out. I got this one and Slash's concert Live in Stoke at the same time. Overall the video quality is good but the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. There are moments where the band overpowers Slash's guitar so that I can't hear his solo's which was annoying. Also this video was shot near the end of the tour and it shows. The band is tired on stage, less energetic and a lot less tight. This is clear in Weilands voice which is noticably off key on a few songs. Some of his ad-libed screams are also jarringly off-key and detract from the solo's. I would have preferred a show shot somewhere near the begininning of the tour where the band wasn't so tired. The best parts of the DVD were the cover songs. Weiland's voice held up better and even suited the songs. I guess its due to the fact that the songs are older and more set, whereas Velvet Revolver's songs are newer and less established leaving. They were still trying to find their voice within the band.

Overall I was dissappointed by this DVD. I wanted to like it, I love the band and am sad they have split. But when I compare it to Slash Live in Stoke, Slash wins hands down. It's not even a contest.
Save your money and get the Slash DVD instead.",1356480000,,1298,4.21285140562249
8431400,5,B004IZJL30,"Bad they broke up cause this is an excellent piece of work! The band is much more cohesive and actually seems to have fun on stage and to be happy to play in Germany. Speaking of Germany, this is shot beautifully! Cameras everywhere and thank God for once it is well edited! You actually feel you are there and it is very nice to see the crowd's reaction, it brings more life to the concert. Scott is beautiful, the Golden age, a real rock n' roll frontman (not shaking around like before ;)  Buy it, this is their legacy!!!",1350864000,4,524,4.292929292929293
8431401,4,B004IZJL30,"i was not sure if it deserved a 4? maybe a 3 and a half.....anyway
a big fan of these guys they have put 2 dvdz out this 1 being there second
for me it seem like u could sence soming wrong between scott and the rest of the band....as at the end of the show scott makes a fast exit...not long after this dvd the band broke up
so maybe it be wise to get there first dvd i guess it be alot more eletric?
let it roll still a good rock n roll show with good volcals and slash ripping it up that man just dose not seem to put a foot wrong...with the rest of the band following.....all n all not to shabby...",1350172800,,601,3.7777777777777777
