2417475,3,B000BISBDE,"This DVD has been around for 10 years. I say it's time for a commentary track, trailer collection and Japanese version reboot. I love this movie. Godzilla claps, laughs, sticks his tongue out and taunts Kong with fire. Kong gets revenge with Judo flip and tail swing. The pro wrestling style fighting has never been equaled an any G-film. Go ahead and ask Dr. Johnson...he knows...",1130544000,8,381,4.787878787878788

2417477,3,B000BISBDE,"One of the most popular of the original godzilla films in its home country, this is a enjoyable but silly film. In part it is a satire of the genre, but whatever the film was trying to do is forgotten as soon as Kong comes on screen. Effects supervisor Tsuburaya created many fine effects in his life,but this was not one of them. He managed to create one of the most god awful monsters in film history! A hysterical shaggy ape, worse than any seen in the most slipshod hollywood serials. Sadly, he did no better when he returned to Kong a few years later with King Kong Escapes. Still, the movie IS enjoyable, with a sort of all star wrestling final battle. However,other films in the series are better. see the original film, Godzilla vs the Thing, Destroy all monsters or any of the new series from Biolante through Destroyer (1989-1995)

As for King Kong Escapes....well...its pretty awful all around....with pathetic suits (other than Gorosaurus) and a laughable plot. Painful to all but hardcore TOHO fans...as insulting to KING KONG as the american GODZILLA was to the original Japanese versions",1129680000,7,1102,4.769633507853404
2417478,5,B000BISBDE,"If you had cable in the 80s, you'll remember that WOR used to have their King Kong Vs. Godzilla film festival on Thanksgiving and the Day After Thanksgiving. I've been missing it since they stopped doing them in 1985. The Godzilla titles have been out for a while. But we were missing the big apes. A few months ago, I rejoiced when the King Kong boxset was announced. I could recreate the joy at home now. But we were still missing the big link - the showdown. And now here it comes - although not in time for Thanksgiving - so it'll have to be viewed with leftovers in my belly.

Contary to purists, I want to see these two films the way I remember them. I've been disappointed watching the uncut Godzilla films. Godzilla Vs. The Smog Monster didn't seem as weird on the new DVD. So I'm not going complain that were not getting the Toho originals. These are basically cheesy movies featuring guys in monster suits wrestling. Relax and enjoy. I'm thrilled they are letterboxed cause we are talking about two huge monsters that need a scope frame to fit in their bulk.

I'm thrilled that these two movies are on the same set.",1128729600,24,1125,4.429951690821256
2417479,5,B000BISBDE,"I've been waiting for years for this campy Japanese sci-fi classic to come out on DVD, and the fact that it's coming with KING KONG vs. GODZILLA makes it that much better! I remember seeing KING KONG ESCAPES at a 2-for-1 matinee along with BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES one afternoon back in the early 70's. Yeah, it's got cheesy special effects, atrocious dubbing and B-movie American actors along with a Japanese cast, but that's what makes these movies the guilty-pleasure classics that they are!

2417481,5,B000BISBDE,"At last I finally watched the rare and movie gem King Kong Escapes. First I will talk about Godzilla vs. King Kong. Definitely not the best movie in terms of effects and plot, the Kong suit looked ridiculous but Godzilla wasn't bad I liked it how they made him look more reptilian. But don't take this movie seriously, it is pure comedy. The fight in the end is enjoyable and all around it is pure fun so grab some popcorn and enjoy. Now to King Kong Escapes, I didn't have high expectations but I was anxious to watch it. The best part of the movie was Kong vs. Gorosaurus what a shame it lasted for five minutes. The Kong suit isn't any better than the one from King Kong vs. Godzilla. The story follows Dr. Who stealing Element X and creating Mechani Kong who fights Kong in the end of a tower which was well done. Another popcorn special.",1271808000,,842,4.30188679245283
2417482,3,B000BISBDE,"King Kong vs. Godzilla:
I was somewhat disappointed that this is the butchered American version, which I have seen over a dozen times since 1975 (I first saw it at my local theater which was owned by the family of a friend of mine who showed at my request, and made a tidy profit to boot)and NOT the original Japanese version that I would love to see.
Still, this is a fun time-waster and better than the pan and scan version we have had to watch on TV.

King Kong Escapes:
The over-rated original is a classic, the 1977 remake had a better screen play (I think most people hate this movie more for the lousy spfx if anything else), the 2005 version most likely is the best Kong movie filmed thus far and the above film had Godzilla.
But KKE is my favorite King Kong film. The best thing about it is the villain Dr. Who. With his sinister eyebrows, crooked smile, deep Paul Frees-dubbed voice and troop of comic book henchmen, Eisei Amamoto comes off like a cross betwixt a flamboyant yet sadistic Bond villain and a comical, campy 'Batman' villain.
The worst thing that could be said about the film is Linda Miller's (dubbed) whiny voice which is extremely annoying. No wonder Gorosaurus wanted to eat her. He wasn't hungry, he just wanted to shut her up! And another thing, with that yummy little darling running around in short skirts, why don't me get at least one panty shot?! Damn Honda and Rankin for try to keep a G rating!
And, of course, let's not forget Mechanikong, one of my favorite robot monster(next to his cousin Mechagodzilla)and Akira Ifukube's wonderfully campy music score.
Overall, KKE is a silly, fun monster movie that would make a good double feature with 'Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster'(another kaiju eiga with James Bondian overtones that was originally going to be a sequel to KKVG, sans Godzilla) or 'Daleks: Invasion Earth 2150'(with it's cool jazz score) or 'Batman'(1966).",1248566400,,1903,4.663690476190476

2417484,4,B000BISBDE,"This package is actually complements itself very well. King Kong vs. Godzilla brought back both these giant monster movie legends for a new generation. It was the fight everyone was waiting to happen after Japan made Godzilla in 1954. The sequel, King Kong Escapes has a very interesting plot. It was Japan's way to continue the story from King Kong vs. Godzilla where in the American version King Kong defeats Godzilla. In this movie, King Kong fights against a scientist named Dr. Who. A scientist who creates a giant robot version Kong called Robot Kong. I believe this was the film that inspired the creators of Godzilla to make Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla.",1239062400,,660,4.901785714285714
2417485,5,B000BISBDE,"King Kong vs. Godzilla--

I remember watching this all the time when I was 4 and 5. My dad was a fan of godzilla and found King Kong vs. Godzilla on VHS at a video store.
We had this video until the tape got ruined!!! And I haven't seen it for 6+ years. But I decided to buy it one day one day, for this classic and historic film. This is probably the best slug fest, ever in Godzilla history. There has been good ones, but this tops everything. It has everything a godzilla movie should have. Godzilla destroying stuff, and the military failing every time, bad dubbing, and a fight at the end, and this nails it.

King Kong Escapes--

Okay, really I just tried to buy King Kong vs. Godzilla, and didn't care for Kong Escapes, because one time it was on Sci-Fi and my dad recorded it, and we still have it today, on tape. And I can't believe the amount of reviews tried to go for King Kong Escapes in this package. I think it was just thrown in their for a bonus, so did my dad. But I still like it, really though, only too see Gorosaurus in action.

I'm a Godzilla fan and I bought this, King Kong is awesome, I just think he's just another monster though (but a better one), I'd say this package is really meant for those Godzilla fans. Since they both are made by Toho, and have the same idea, of monster vs. monster. If you're a godzilla fan, love people in rubber suits fighting, and love hilarious bad dubbing (which I do). This is definetly a must own. It's in my Top 5 Godzilla films, and #1 in Slugfests.",1236643200,,1513,4.189003436426117

OTHERWISE KING KONG SUCKS AND SO DOES THE FACT THAT THE MAKERS OF KING KONG ESCAPES NAMED THE BAD GUY DOCTOR WHO! HOW DARE YOU! A ROCK THROUGH YOUR WINDOW SIR! UNFORTUNATELY KING KONG VS GODZILLA IS ALSO THE 2ND WORSE GODZILLA FILM OF ALL TIME. IT WAS THE WORST UNTILL GODZILLA VS MEGAGUIRUS, BUT THATS FOR A DIFFERENT REVIEW.

King kong vs. Godzilla was way better, and way more hilarious. I've watched that one quite alot. The battles are great, and there are alot of really good minatures too.
So, king kong escapes=ok but not great

I'd say it's a good collection, recomended to anyone who enjoys this genre.",1230595200,,544,4.618556701030927
2417489,5,B000BISBDE,"King Kong vs. Godzilla and King Kong Escapes are probably two of the most fun and entertaining kaiju films ever to come out of the far east. First up we get the famous King Kong vs. Godzilla. Thanks to this film, Godzilla's been a world pop icon and beloved by millions on every continent (Well, maybe except Antarctica). I should note though that you're getting the American version, not the Japanese version. With that being said, you'll know what to expect. King Kong is downright ugly due to the suit being one of the worst in history which is a mystery since Mr. Tsuburaya himself had great respect for the ape and was known for great costumes like King Ghidorah, Gorosaurus, Anguirus (1968), etc. Godzilla looks okay but his face is bent down a little making him an odd version of the monster king. The two kings give a great fight and one of the greatest in kaiju history. You should definitely go check it out for yourselves. Now for an even more fun film, King Kong Escapes! Kong looks way more better then his previous film but he still looks kinda ugly. Mechani-Kong is a well thought up foe for the eighth wonder of the world and is the inspiration for the famous and lethal Mechagodzilla. Gorosaurus makes his first appearance here in all of his Kangaroo-Kicking glory and gives the good 'old ape a good fight. There's one more monster, the giant sea serpent but he's not a big deal for Kong to worry. The DVD's for each film have fantastic quality but lacking in any sort of extras but at least the price is a low one. To wrap it all up, two fun films presented on two perfect DVD's (In quality), and it's a good buy considering the price being low.",1214352000,2,1663,4.4557377049180324
2417490,5,B000BISBDE,"Seen both films when I was a kid, teen. and, adult. I have to say many thanks for Peter Jackson remake is why both films got release. I hear people complaints about no extras, or no japanese version. I say who cares. I'm just glad the movies got release in widesceen with decent picture quality. Another thing you can't beat the price for both films. In life take what you can get, and be happy.",1208390400,,395,4.28
2417491,4,B000BISBDE,"I recall seeing both these movies way back when I first started watching Godzilla movies. Both are among my favorites to watch every now and then. I mean, who wouldn't want to see an American icon like King Kong go up against the 'King of Monsters'? or see Kong go up against a Mecha-version of himself? I'll admit, by today's standards, both of the movies are kinda cheesy and the plots are 'out there' but they are still fun to watch. Makes me wish that Toho could/would make more up-to-date versions of these two movies. From what I've read online, Toho did try that back in '91 -especially with King Kong vs Godzilla- but Turner Entertainment(owners of the original film) asked for too much money for King Kong's use in the film to which Toho declined & instead made Godzilla vs King Ghidorah as part of the Heisei series. With the recent success of Peter Jackson's King Kong, I think it would benefit both parties quite well. Not only making Godzilla fans happy but generating interest in the original Kong film as well as the rest of movies in the franchise. At any rate; we can hope that one day, in the near future, both companies can come to some agreement so our favorite giant monsters from opposite ends of the globe can battle it out once again.

Both of these movies were directed by Ishiro Honda with visual effects either done by or directed by Eiji Tsuburaya.

King Kong vs Godzilla was made in 1962 and tells the story about Mr. Tako who is head over a pharmaceuticals company. Frustrated with the tv shows his company is sponsoring, he tries to come up with something to boost the ratings. He soon finds out about a giant monster that was discovered on Faro Island. Believing it would give him the publicity he needs, he sends two men to find and bring the monster back. Meantime, an American submarine gets caught in an iceberg. The same iceberg that Godzilla was trapped in the movie, Godzilla Raids Again. Godzilla eventually breaks out and head toward a nearby Japanese Artic base to which he obliterates. On Faro Island, Kong is captured by Tako's men and brought back to Japan. Kong breaks free and meets up with Godzilla & the rest is history. You know what happens, lol, just by looking at the title. Guess who comes out the winner. It sold 11.2 million tickets during it's inital theatrical run in Japan and holds the title of having the highest attendance records ever on any Godzilla movie to date.

King Kong Escapes was made in 1967(hehe.. the year I was born). A mean genius named Dr. Who creates a Mecha-Kong in order to dig for a highly radioactive element dubbed ""Element X"". When Mecha-Kong fails, he decides to kidnap the real Kong and hypnotize him to dig for it. Kong soon snaps out of it and heads off for Tokyo. Kong and Mecha-Kong end up fighting on Tokyo Tower with the city hanging in the balance. This is also the first film to feature Gorosaurus(who played a part in Destroy All Monsters and made a cameo in Godzilla's Revenge) who is a fan favorite from Toho Films.

While there is no special features to speak of nor no extras, any respectful Godzilla or King Kong fan owes it to themselves to add these films to their collection just to have them. The way things stand right now, we might never see any more films featuring Kong & Godzilla duking it out or Kong battling a mecha version of himself. That, in itself, makes these two films worth collecting. My only gripe is that you're unable to see it in its' original Japanese dialogue with subtitles. I would've loved to have seen it that way.",1183680000,3,3545,4.534375
2417492,5,B000BISBDE,"When I was a kid and saw King Kong Escapes, I was mesmerized by the Mechi-Kong robot.  What a great idea! He looks so cool!  It had been so many years since I saw the film, I thought I had dreamt the movie.  Imagine my suprise with this two-pack release! It is a pristine wide screen presentation.  The film is as fun as I remembered it.  Not to be taken too seriously, it is a rubber monster movie with cool ideas and plenty of monsters clashing, all within the trademark cheapo effects of the time.  Utterly charming.

The Toho version of Kong (his rubber suit, that is) is truly awful, but this only adds to the fun of the film.  As this is a Japanese movie overdubbed in English, we also have the voice talents of Paul Frees (""Winter Warlock"" from the Rankin / Bass production of ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"") providing the voice of the villian.  What more could you ask for?  How about the bonus of getting Godzilla vs. King Kong? You got it!  What a bargain!",1174348800,,968,4.322222222222222

2417494,4,B000BISBDE,"KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1962)

PLOT: Mr. Tako, head of Pacific Pharmaceuticals, is frustrated with the television shows his company is sponsoring and wants something to boost his ratings. Tako is informed by a special type of berry that only grows on a small Pacific island called Faro Island. The natives there process the berries into a juice that they use as a medicine. They also use the juice as an offering to their giant god named ""Kong"". Tako sees potential in the berries and decides to set up an expedition to Faro Island. When Tako's men arrive at Faro Island, the natives there claim that ""Kong"" is real being. Meanwhile, an American submarine named Seahawk gets caught in an iceberg. Something goes wrong and the submarine blows up. An American helicopter hovering above watch as the iceberg breaks open and Godzilla crawls out. Godzilla heads toward a nearby army base. The base is no match for the mighty power of Godzilla. Back at Faro, a giant octopus attacks the village and the natives quickly throw spears at it. Unfortunately, the spears are no match for the giant creature. Suddenly, Kong shows up and beats up the giant octopus, sending it crawling back into the sea. Kong drinks some of the giant containers of berry juice and falls asleep. Tako's men then inform him of Kong. Tako makes plans to take Kong back to Tokyo, as a publicity stunt for Pacific Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Tako arrives on the ship transporting Kong, but unfortunately, the monster then wakes up and breaks free from the raft. Kong finally reaches Tokyo and meets up with Godzilla in a valley. This is a match between the mightiest monsters of all time. Who will win?

COMMENTS: This film marked the first time that two famous monsters from separate film franchises were teamed up since Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man (1943). This film acted as both a sequel to Son Of Kong (1933) as well as Godzilla Raids Again (1955). The film marked the first time either monster was seen in color and also the first time Kong was created using suitmation rather than a stop-motion model. For Godzilla, King Of The Monsters (1954), Toho Studios had originally planned on making Godzilla as a stop-motion model, but the process proved to be too extensive for the tight budget. For that film, and every other one to follow, it became traditional to create Toho's monsters through suitmation. The film was directed by Ishiro Hondo, who directed most of the classic Godzilla films. He purposely made the film campy and comical in order to entertain (and not frighten) children. The film itself is not exactly an Oscar-worthy film, but it featured two very popular monsters in a death match and several people went to see it. In Japan, it became the highest grossing Godzilla film to date. Many King Kong fans hate the comical appearance of Kong in the film. For the American film poster, they used a cropped photo of Kong from the original film rather than the way he looked in this film. Kong was made to look comical so the audiences would root for him over Godzilla. Many fans have noticed that King Kong is much larger in this film than he was in the original King Kong film. The film states that the reason for this was because the narcotic berries that Kong ate also contained growth hormones, which would explain him growing to the equal enormous size of Godzilla. At one point during the fight sequence, Kong shoves a tree down Godzilla's throat. This was a tribute to the original King Kong film, in which Kong shoved a tree down a Tyrannosaurus Rex's throat. Several rumours exist between the Japanese and American versions of the film. It is claimed that the film is called King Kong vs. Godzilla in the U.S. and Godzilla vs. King Kong in Japan. This is untrue; the film has the same title in both countries. Also, it is also claimed that Kong won the fight in the American version and that Godzilla won the fight in the Japanese version. This is also untrue; King Kong won in both films. Some fans also argue that King Kong swims away at the end because he is frightened of Godzilla, who didn't resurface from the ocean because he lives underwater anyay. Just the same, Toho Studios announced that King Kong was always meant to be the victor. At the time, King Kong was more popular in Japan, even though Godzilla was a Japanese creation. The film sparked sequels from the point of view of both monsters. Godzilla made his return in Mothra vs. Godzilla (a.k.a. Godzilla vs. The Thing) (1964); King Kong made his return in King Kong Escapes (1967). This DVD presents the film in the original widescreen theatrical ratio. There are no special features.

KING KONG ESCAPES (1967)

PLOT: The film begins with a UN submarine searching for oil. The ship is under the command of Commander Carl Nelson (Rhodes Reason). Susan Watson (Linda Miller) finds Nelson in his quarters with Lt. Hiro Nomura (Akira Takarada). The two are studying photographs of gorillas and they inform her of the legend of King Kong, who supposedly inhabits the nearby Mondo Island. Meanwhile at the North Pole, strange things are going on at a secret base. The base is run by the evil genius Dr. Who (Eisei Amamoto). Dr. Who is being employed by the mysterious Madame X (Mia Hama). Madame X has hired Dr. Who to dig up a mineral called Element X, which makes uranium look like gravel. In order to do the job, Dr. Who and his men have built a giant robot version of King Kong, called Mechani-Kong, to dig up the Element X. Unfortunately, the radiation from the deposit short out the robot's circuits. Mechani-Kong must be redesigned so that this doesn't happen again. Back in the sub, an underwater rockslide damages the rudder. The sub docks at Mondo Island for repairs. Nelson takes the opportunity to explore the island with Nomura and Susan. A native on the island tells them to leave, for they are trespassing on the territory of King Kong. Nelson and Nomura go after the native to ask him more questions, leaving Susan behind at their hovercraft. Suddenly, a large dinosaur called Gorosaurus comes out of the jungle. Susan screams in terror and the mighty King Kong comes to her rescue. Kong fights with the Gorosaurus and eventually kills it by breaking its jaw. Nelson and the others make it back to the submarine. Kong, who has has become smitten with Susan, follows. A large sea serpant attacks the sub, but Kong quicky attacks and kills it. Later on, the three UN explorers hold a press conference to discuss the events involving King Kong. Madame X attends the conference disguised as a reporter. She then sends her information back to Dr. Who, who decides to capture the real King Kong for digging up Element X. Is Dr. Who brilliant enough to capture the mighty King Kong?

COMMENTS: This film was produced by both Toho Studios and Rankin/Bass Productions. Rankin & Bass were famous at the time for producing Christmas TV specials such as Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964), Frosty The Snowman (1969), and Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town (1970). The film acted as a sequel to King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) while at the same time being a spin-off of the Rankin/Bass animated series The King Kong Show. Ishiro Honda once again returned as director. The character of Mechani-Kong was first used in the animated King Kong show. It later served as the inspiration for Mecha-Godzilla in Godzilla vs. Mecha-Godzilla (1974). The Gorosaurus dinosaur also returned in other Toho Godzilla films, including Destroy All Monsters (1969). The scene in where Kong kills the Gorosaurus by breaking its jaw is actually a tribute to the original King Kong (1933), in which Kong kills a Tyrannosaurus Rex the same way. The fight scene between Kong and the sea serpent is also a tribute to a similar scene in the original King Kong. There is also much confusion about the character of Dr. Who, who bears the same name as a TV series and titular character on British television. Despite the fact that both characters have the same name, they are not related. This film isn't exactly the best King Kong film, but it is entertaining for children and it serves as a nice follow-up to King Kong vs. Godzilla. Plus, Mechani-Kong is a really cool character. This DVD presents the film in the original widescreen theatrical ratio. There are no special features.",1173916800,5,8301,4.729972375690608
2417495,5,B000BISBDE,"What else would you expect, it the movie we all grew up with. How can you not love it plus you get the equally campy and horribly good King Kong Escape! Love good bad movies, especially with giant monsters wreaking havoc!",1173657600,,221,4.414634146341464
2417496,4,B000BISBDE,"Who can resist that title?! This is another very entertaining entry in the Godzilla series. This is the first Kong film produced by ToHo, but I think King Kong Escapes is a much funnier film. The Kong costumes are quite different in the two films with this Kong looking more evil and the other looking more cute. I'm sure the Rankin & bass influence in ""Escapes"" could be behind that.

King Kong VS Godzilla has plenty of action and some great and hilarious fight scenes. The special effect and miniatures are also some of the better in most cases, but there are some goofy looking effects here and there.(i.e. the plastic wrap on the octopus to make it look wet whenever Kong is holding it.)

There are some inconsistencies in the folk lore of these two titans such as Godzilla and King Kong's size difference and Kong getting stronger with lightning, but who cares?.... this is a battle royal and it is a real hoot once we get to the big brawl!

I have always been a fan of the older Toho films and King Kong escapes is one of the most actioned pack and fun entries from the studio. It's hokey to say the least, but it does have a lot of charm for those who grew up with these pictures. The story basically retells the original Kong story, but with silly sub plots including the villainous Doctor Who(Hu) creating a robot Kong(MechaKong)! The film is truly hilarious and the dubbing only adds to the fun.

This film was produced by non other than Rankin & Bass which gives it a strange fantasy quality that only they could bring. Doctor Who's voice over dub was done by one of Rankin and Bass's favorite heavies from their animated Christmas specials, I can not think of his name, but when you hear that voice you will immediately think of those classic holiday specials.

I give both these film 5 stars for their fun factor and because their full of hysterical action sequences. If you're a fan of Godzilla and these types of films these two are real treats! My review is for the older release two pack with King Kong VS Godzilla and King Kong Escapes. I don't know if the newer editions have added anything to warrant buying them as I can not find any info about either. This is usually not a good sign and I suspect it to be the same DVD's with a new covers....bummer!

This older two disc set has very clean DVD transfers and they are in widescreen, but there are no extras at all, not even trailers! Buy the two pack and enjoy, these are both really funny films!

In Short - hard to resist two for the price of one. These movies are pretty silly, but it's hard to dislike any of these older ToHo films. King Kong Escapes is hilarious dito King Kong VS Godzilla. I grew up watching all of these films, so it brought back some good memories. The prints here look pretty good and they are in widescreen, I would love to see these released with the Japanese versions added and some bonus material included. These are ""party with your buddies"" movies if there ever were any!",1173225600,,2976,4.41970802919708

2417501,4,B000BISBDE,"King Kong Escape:

Dr. Who has been hired to mine a highly radioactive element in the North Pole by Madame X.  Yes, his name is Dr. Who.  No, he is not a Rogue Time Lord.  Can we get on with it?  His robotic King Kong, which is based on the real one, fails to do the job so they go to get the real King Kong.  As you can guess the movie ends with both Kongs fighting on the Tokyo Tower.  I think it was the Tokyo Tower before they climb it.  Poor, poor Tokyo.  Why do all the monsters end up there?

Soon King Kong and the Robot Kong is fighting over the lovely Lt. Susan Watson, played by Linda Miller, while causing lots of damage in the process.

Funny, well done, lots of action and adventure.  A mixture of giant monster movie and James Bond movie.  Just warm up some pop corn and sit in front of the TV and enjoy.

King Kong vs. Godzilla:

Jason vs. Freddy.  Dracula vs. Helsing.  Clinton vs. Dole.  Our movies are full of one super creature going up against another super creature.  Now we get King Kong vs. Godzilla.  You would think this would be a great flick.  A large dinosaur who shoots fire against a giant ape who has thumbs and can think.  What kind of tactics would the great ape think up to counter Godzilla's breath?  What would his massive brain come up with to tackle the tiny brained dinosaur?  Would he show how truly smart the King is?

Nope.  They fail to use the ape's large brain but for two scenes.  In one he ambushes Godzilla and in another where he tries to use a tree.  They DO make up a gimmick to give the King a equal chance.  They make it so he can absorb electricity.  Oh gee, how nice.  Of course, after he charges up he can use his hands like tazers.  ZAP!  ZAP!

And the scale between Kong and the people, buildings, other objects keeps

changing!  In the end I had to take one point away.",1162166400,2,1829,4.1257142857142854

People much under 35 just can't understand what it's like not to have a movie you want to see whenever you want to see one.

2417503,5,B000BISBDE,"I remember watching both of these movies many times as kid on free public television. Watching King Kong vs. Godzilla I wished Godzilla would have raised his head out of the ocean at the end, but Kong always did. I still feel the Godzilla mask in King Kong vs. Godzilla is the best one. I even feel King Kongs mask was the right look in all the Kong movies even over the 1933 original. This movie was dogged with limited special effects. And could have been better with better technology Toho pictures did the best they could with the limited technology they had during the early 1960s. I wish Godzilla had won this battle, toho pictures should have let Godzilla win. I did not mind ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"" score and ""The Monster That Challanged The World"" score fused in. I thought both music scores blended in nicley for the movie. King Kong escapes gets some real bad critism. I feel (Rhodes Reason) played a real Dr. Carl Nelson. The villian Dr. Who (Mie Hama) was played brilliantly. The only negative for me was the fight between Kong and Mecha Kong, ""could we have a little more fighting please?"" This may be considered a stupid Toho monster movie, but I consider it a great effort the musical score by Akira Ifikube is brilliant. You really feel the music score in the fight with the two Kongs on the tower building as well as throughout the film.the remastering on King Kong escapes is incredible, seeing kong fight gorosaurus brought back childhood memories. King kong vs. Godzilla remastering has a cleaned up picture but nothing like ""Escapes"" both movies have great sound quality. I would always see these two movies in full screen television as a kid throughout the 1970s, it is a pleasure to see them both in widescreen like they were seen in the movies in the 1960s.

Die-hard Kong fans probably won't like this.  Let's be honest, it's probably impossible for a single movie to be loyal to the style of both monsters considering the differences in the underlying movies.  The original ""Kong"" and Peter Jackson's worthy sucessor/remake are both driven by non-human special effects--stop motion and CGI.  Godzilla on the other hand uses ""suitmation"" (and a few years ago, we all saw how unsuccesful the American attempt to convert him to more hi-tech effects was).  This movie was produced by Toho and, with one exception, it uses the latter technique--suits and all. Go into it expecting something like ""Destroy All Monsters"" and you won't be disappointed.

This two-pack includes the American repackaged version of the Japanese orginal.  It contains awkwardly-inserted scenes containing caucasian actors and sadly deletes of the original musical score by Arika Ifukube.  While I would prefer the original version, I will settle for the sake of the bargain price.

The other benefit is the added-on movie, King Kong Escapes.  Like the main movie, this is an odd spin on the big ape (Mecha-Kong?!?).  This is probably a movie I would not have watched but for its inclusion here...but as a wacky, light-hearted fantasy, it works.

In short, if you appreciate the idea of Kong done kaiju-style then come for the main bout versus Godzilla.  Stay for the match-up with the evil robotic twin.",1146960000,3,1662,5.018248175182482

2417513,4,B000BISBDE,"Although most cheesy movies tilt to the bad side, ""King Kong Escapes"" rates as ""good"" cheesy.  Is that an Oscar category?  Probably not.  Purist fans of the original film classic King Kong should beware of this Japanese sideshow.  The Kong in this flick can only be described as if Classic Kong had a dopey cousin that the family just couldn't assimilate.  The man in the ape suit achieves facial expressions that reminds one of Jerry Lewis or the Three Stooges.  He also displays a certain goofiness that can only be compared to Scooby Doo.  Mix this humor with that special Japanese sci-fi panache that true fans admire, and you get the idea.  This epic is filmed against miniature sets that are amply supplied with toy tanks, planes, submarines, and other military hardware.  The busy plot mixes sci-fi monsters with espionage and secret agents.  In fact, the femme fatale is Mie Hama, which some viewers may remember as Kissy Suzuki in ""You Only Live Twice.""  American actor Rhodes Reason, well on his way to career oblivion, shows up as a U. N. submarine commander battling a mad scientist named Dr. Who.  (Not to be confused with the British Time Lord).  Dr. Who invented a mecha-Kong to mine element X (or something) that will give the villains the power to rule the world.  The giant monsters' eventual dual is a high point of the movie.  Viewers should take special note of the Fay Wray stand in.  She plays the submarine's medical officer and Kong's heartthrob.  Pay special attention to her squeaky nasal-toned voice and blond coiffure (an obvious wig).  Also note her mini-skirted uniform and boots that only the '60s could love.  This movie is a sequel, of sorts, of ""King Kong vs. Godzilla.""  The two DVDs are sold as a reasonably priced packaged product.  Unless you consider trailers as a bonus, there are no extras.

2417517,4,B000BISBDE,"I won't get into the technical side of this review because, A) I'm not a technically-oriented person, and B) I'm simply amazed I even have a DVD player at all.  Pretty much EVERY DVD I've ever watched has better sound and picture quality than any single VHS tape I've seen.  That having been said, it's time for me to expound on what I have found to be one of the most intriguing reinventions of the Eighth Wonder of the World ever committed to celluloid, if not necessarily grandiose.

KING KONG VS. GODZILLA

The third Godzilla film - and the first one in color - picks up some time after the little-seen ""Godzilla Raids Again"": our favorite fire-breathing reptilian bursts out of his Arctic entombment thanks to a clumsy submarine crew and heads back for Tokyo to do some exercises just as (surprise, surprise) King Kong surfaces on Faro Island and, through the means of a typically-greedy businessman, ends up making a beeline straight for the Big G.

Now you don't go into a movie like this, let alone any ""Versus"" movie, expecting gut-wrenching physical drama on the order of ABC's Wide World of Sports; what you should expect is pure and total fanboy's-dream absurdity of premise and relentlessly-high camp in execution (see ""Freddy vs. Jason"").  Never mind how Kong came back to life after plummeting to his death, or how he ended up on a Japanese island or even how he grew an extra 350 feet in the interim - if you're one of those people whose brain will be racked trying to figure those things out, this is NOT the movie for you.  Admittedly, the film looks its age, but then most of the best of these movies are visibly dated anyway.  And to be honest, there's a fair bit of satire in KKvG that holds up within the campy context of the film: Big Business looking for the next ad sensation, advocacy for smoking and drinking and loud pop music, the sly underpinnings of Kong and Godzilla chasing the same young woman, military intelligence suggesting that a big hole full of dynamite can stop a living four-hundred-foot-tall nuclear bomb.  No kid is going to care about this stuff, but that's O.K.; the monster sequences are some of the most technically ornate in the series' early history.

Having said all of this, the film does have two significant weaknesses, which are the same in pretty much every Godzilla movie but here are more heavily accentuated: A) the emphasis on the human drama rather than the slugfest, and B) an ""over-Americanization"" of the film.  I'll get to the latter in a moment, but first, the human angle doesn't suit the picture as well as it should.  There's some attempt at soap opera drama involving a brother and sister living in Tokyo and her boyfriend, but it never really goes any further than the setup. Which in this case is a shame, since as gleefully cheesy as the movie is already, this could have made it a real riot.  The more detrimental problem with this film is the aforementioned ""over-Americanization"" of the film, which in this case involves both erratic dubbing AND inserting U.S.-filmed footage, a la Raymond Burr in the original ""Godzilla"".  However, it doesn't work here.  Firstly, because it's presented under the banner of the United Nations News Network (they sure haven't been the same since Catwoman, Joker, Penguin and Riddler vaporized the Security Council) so as to create a false sense of ""ringside commentary"", and secondly, because in addition to American actors, you have English-speaking Latin Americans and Asian-Americans figuring into the mix as well.  Having an Asian-American speaking more impeccable English than most present-day Caucasians may have been intended to bolster the film's credibility, and to that end Toho deserves credit, but when the rest of the movie involves badly-dubbed Japanese actors, it kind of disrupts the narrative flow.

Lastly, there's the stars themselves.  Godzilla looks great in this one; Toho obviously took great care to make sure their biggest star looked his best in color.  The opening defensive against Godzilla may be one of the best miniature sequences in the early films.  And while the character has embryonic hints of silliness in his performance, he's still a mean mofo and it largely comes through whenever he's on screen.  By contrast, Kong is the more comedic of the two, and everything about him suggests a more cartoonish approach, even the suit.  This ape suit is easily among the worst ever filmed, but it might have been cut a little more slack if not for a truly awful Kong head used for close-ups.  This second mask, I'm guessing, was meant to make the character more expressive than the mask on the ""stunt"" suit would allow, but at least there Kong still looks reasonably menacing.  Had they just stuck with the ""stunt"" mask, that might have made this representation of the Kong character less overly goofy; as Captain Kirk once said, too much of anything is not necessarily a good thing.

All in all, though, KKvG is likely to provide a good time for those of us weaned on Saturday-night Creature Features.  For its efforts, it's still entertaining to watch.

KING KONG ESCAPES

Now this one is a true rarity.  I've only ever seen this movie once before on cable.  It was apparently Toho's attempt to branch their new version of Kong out into his own series of films, to little avail.  But it still is fun to watch for as much as any Japanese monster mash is.  In a nutshell, this one involves Kong (now on Mondo Island rather than Faro - apparently they ran out of soma berries) becoming the subject of the mad desires of the scientist Dr. Who (again, no relation to the famous Time Lord - how the distributors of this movie avoided a lawsuit, I don't know).  Crazy old Dr. Who needs super-strong Kong to dig through his mines looking for a powerful radioactive substance for Who's mysterious benefactor (the lovely Mie Hama, who got additional exposure to American audiences around this time as Kissy Suzuki in the 007 outing ""You Only Live Twice"" and as Teri Yaki in ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"").  To achieve this end, Who kidnaps Kong's new human friends, Commander Nelson and his crewmates Susan and Jiro, to try to coerce him to obeying Who's orders when the usual mind-control ploys fail.  When Kong escapes, and Nelson's team right behind him, Who sends out the ultimate super-weapon to bring Kong to his knees...(wait for it)...MECHANI-KONG!!!  Yup, the 'giant monster's evil robot twin' gag starts right here, even before Mecha-Godzilla.

The movie itself, like all such fare imported from Toho, is grade-A cheese, yet that's part of its charm.  And unlike KKvG, it's completely unfettered by American-filmed sequences, even though the American actors at some points do end up dubbing themselves over (maybe the distributors saw the discrepancies in KKvG?).  In terms of pacing, it's also a much faster movie than KKvG, something that ultimately worked to these movies' favor as time went on.

The characterization here is much stronger than KKvG, even if doesn't make a whole lot of sense on a couple occasions (as when Madame X predictably switches sides because she's got the hots for Commander Nelson).  As for the monsters, Kong starts out perfectly in line with where we last left him in KKvG, and ultimately ends up becoming a big kid who will follow lovely Susan around anywhere (you have to give Toho credit on this score too: at least their version of Kong still has that weakness for the ladies).  Mechani-Kong is the real weak link in this chain, since he's simply a big remote-controlled toy for Dr. Who, but he proves nasty enough to leave a memorable impression.

The monkey suits here are a bit of an improvement.  Mechani-Kong, being an armor-plated robot and genuinely cool-looking at that, really doesn't qualify for comparison to the quality of the ape costume in KKvG, but with Kong in this one at least the heads are consistent.  Toho apparently tried to correct the proportions of the suit in relation to those of a real gorilla, which would almost work if not for the fact that the stuntman in the Kong suit - Haru Nakajima, Godzilla's portrayer for the better part of Big G's series - doesn't really employ many ape-like mannerisms in his performance.

KKE is, in many ways, a better film than KKvG.  Which is saying a lot for movies as wonderfully corny as these.

The bottom line: come for the Big G, stay for the evil robot twin.  There are plenty of worse ways to spend your Saturday nights.",1136246400,14,8462,4.782817869415807
2417518,4,B000BISBDE,"I've not yet seen this latest release. Of course, I've seen this film in its full-screen, TV-format, which basically had been the only way to have seen it after its movie theatre run. As the film was being shown regularly on television over the years, the image (and to some degree, the sound) quality  deteriorated. Not to mention, the invevitable ""cropping"" of approximately 1/3 of each scene, as originally photographed, cause by this re-formatting.

Thus, most of us had been viewing a print, probably unwittingly, that was greatly diminished in quality from that that was seen originally in theatres and drive-ins across the country. I myself was unaware for years that these motion pictures originally released theatrically were ""missing something"" as shown on TV.

With this newest release of the Universal-International edition of King Kong Vs. Godzilla, we are presented with a version that is as close to the original as perhaps we've ever seen, with original widescreen format and much better image and audio quality, according to a review in TokyoMonsters.com.

Technical considerations aside, the U.S. version has been widely regarded as inferior to the Japanese version, which very few Americans have ever seen, particluarly because there existed a superior original score by Akira Ifibuke that was unwisely eliminated and replaced with Universal horror themes from previously released films of the 1940's and 50's.

Also, much balleyhooed is the insertion/addition of an American newsroom reporter and paleontologist (along with an English-speaking reporter from Chile), which many reviewers find to be quite disruptive and incongruous to the original Japanese script. I feel the criticisms for this are overdone, however. Moreover, this new excellent condition release will probably minimize this ""shortcoming"" as the rest of the film's monster action and special effects is restored to its original glory.",1135814400,3,1922,5.457912457912458
2417519,5,B000BISBDE,"This is the pinnacle of Japanese filmmaking. Godzilla is in his prime and looking good and King Kong, well you must remember that he died in New York in his first movie. Yes he's an ape zombie, come back from the dead. Fully bipedal in this one Kong is kidnapped from a new island and delivered to Tokyo to destroy Godzilla. Of course they have underestimated the King of Monsters and the only thing that gets destroyed is Tokyo. The monster battles here are the best of any of the Godzilla movies. And don't doubt for a moment this is a Godzilla movie, the first sequel to the original to be followed by Godzilla vs Mothra. Buy this movie, put it in, sit back and prepare for some fun monster matches and a few laughs. Watch out for Godzillas' kangaroo kick!",1134864000,3,759,4.390070921985815
2417520,5,B000BISBDE,"KING KONG ESCAPES; Presented in 2.35:1 true widescreen. Haruo Nakajima the first and longest Godzilla portrayer wears the Kong suit. The actor who portrays Robot Kong is Hiroshi Sekida the same actor who played Sanda, the good brown Gargantua, opposite Nakajima's Giara, the evil green Gargantua. Talk about role reversals. I can't seem to find the portrayer of the Gorasaurus. I was eight years old when this was released in U.S. theaters. Even back then I knew Kong looked questionable. But that didn't stop me from enjoying this fun filled fast paced giant monster movie. 36 years later, after sporadic TV showings and a one time availibility on VHS in fullscreen,finally! KING KONG ESCAPES is released in true widescreen with a beautiful, clear, colorful picture. And no my friends this is not a guilty pleasure for me. I stand tall and proud and shout to the world. I LOVE WATCHING KING KONG ESCAPES! KING KONG vs GODZILLA; released roughly five years before the above movie, also presented in 2.35:1 widescreen. Haruo Nakajima portrays Godzilla. And in this particular outing Godzilla is seen as a brand new monster. This U.S. version disregards his first two appearances. But hey! That's cool,this movie is totally awesome. Kong is portrayed by Shoichi Hirose who went on to play King Ghidorah for his first two earthly invasions. Just watch the way Kong runs with his arms in the air. Incidentally, Shoichi Hirose is credited for playing one of Dr. Who's Henchmen in KING KONG ESCAPES. My guess is, he was the righthand man because he's the first credited henchman. My first viewing of KING KONG vs GODZILLA, also at the age of 8 was on WOR channel 9 Sunday night. Just as Kong gets dropped on his rump from burning the so called indesructible wires attached to the helium balloons... click! Bedtime. To say I was pissed was definately an understatement,as I had to hear all the other kids in school talk about the greatest fight in world history. But miracle of miracles happened a few months later. It was re-released at the local theater and I finally saw the whole thing in glorious color and giant widescreen. The American news coverage gave the movie authenticity. None of which is shown in the Japanese version. I wish Akira Ifukube's original score could have been included as a second audio.",1134518400,10,2308,4.8604060913705585

When I was Seven, I sat on the front row and was awestruck by King Kong vs. Godzilla! I mean, it was SO realistic. Of course, years later, as an adult, I had grown and the screen had shrunk so it just wasn't the same. However, I still enjoyed it even as a grown-up. Now that monster movies have to be made to impress adults and more cynical children, we have lost a little movie magic.

I have a copy of it on vhs but its a horrible copy from tv or something and its all messed up. It was the only way to buy it so i went ahead and bought it. Its going in the trash as i wouldnt even think of selling it because of the very poor quality. The two movies in the set are in widescreen and i thought they would be letterboxed but were not. Your screen on a regular tv will be about 3/4 fill and thats ok. I hate letterbox. I know its the original way it was shot but the black bars are just to much on a small tv. The quality is very good on the disks and you won't be disapointed. This year has been a good year for old movies being released and next year will be even better from what i have seen for future releases.

I mean, they're hairy, but other than that...but, the prize jewel is the Meckani-Kong, a giant robot ape.

2417526,4,B000BISBDE,"If anything good comes out of this new

Kong remake by Peter Jackson it's all the King Kong related ballyho

and I couldn't believe it when I heard Universal wasn't putting out

just one but two of their Toho related epics in letterbox to boot.

I've seen King Kong vs. Godzilla more times than I wish to say It's

just one of those flims I never grew out of (and I'm not alone,last

year's revival at New York's Film Forum was standing room only)

 What is it about this movie that keeps us coming back for repeat

viewings surely we know Kong's not the animated wonder created by

painsakeing stop motion work. Surely Godzilla is not the broodish

figure from his first romp. and we ALL know how it ends but still

the movie has just the right amount of attention & just the right

amount of goofyness that it just equals fun every time. The story

concerns that of an advertising company in search of big story to

boost their tv ratings after the recent reappearance of Godzilla

They come to find on an island in the south pacific the presence

of the island god King Kong. After defeating a giant octopus and

downing a truckload of laced native berry juice he is tranported

to Japan for exploitation and his brawl with the Big G!""King Kong

Escapes"" continues the adventures of our Tatty costumed simian as

he is taken again from his jungle to fall in love with the lovely

Linda Miller, dig up Element X and fight robot repilca of himself

atop the Tokyo Tower (has anyone took count of how many times the

Tower has been destroyed by Toho monsters?)

These are two great disc for two fun monster films my only b***h

is no trailers (which is a shame because they are as fun as the

flicks themselves)",1133136000,4,1711,4.4006410256410255
2417527,5,B000BISBDE,"After an ""off and on"" possible release(Universal kept saying in form letter fashion they had no plans as late as July for either film, they were suddenly announced in the late summer for release now). With the New Kong coming this is as best free promotion as these two films will ever get. The good news: both films are in letterboxed format, the original Tohoscope aspect. Both prints are in good shape overall(As good as I saw them in theaters years ago)with King Kong Escapes being the best of the two. King Kong vs Godzilla is a little well for the wear in some spots but nothing badly detracting(unless you are a total ""manic perfectionist""). Both are dubbed and are the US releases. KK VS G was completely truncated and re-worked anyway with some often hilarious footage(Harry Holcombe and the ""brain comparison"" scene-""UN Newsman Eric Carter"" pondering the marble representing Godzilla's brain- as well him supposedly being a scientist and displaying the kid's Golden Book of Dinosaurs at one point. The set in the background was all put together with thumbtacks and cloth if you look close.) The Toho footage fares better here, than does the obvious grainy stock footage used in the US scenes, and the UN Newsroom footage is spotty, but then, even when it was relatively a new film, it was this way. The film was highly truncated, seemingly at the last moment, for US consumption in the early 60's.

King Kong Escapes is in pretty nice condition, full of color, widescreen. Universal had a grandfather clause on both these films dating back to the 60's(as they co-produced and co-fiananced them with Toho) and held onto all US rights so, any ""Japanese versions"" would have been impossible and a legal morass for Universal to pursue-Toho does their own versions in Japan, Universal their own,in the US-plain and simple. It allows Universal to release their versions of the films with no consultation or legaleze with Toho. No trailers but I didn't expect there would be, and frankly, the price is unbeatable for the two which come, btw, in their own attractive clamshells and packaging, not two or more disks to one package(ala Universal's recent ""Hammer Franchise Collection"" which crams in 8 films on two disks).

The ""music supervisor"" on KK VS G is credited(using all stock Universal stuff) and yet Akira Ifukube is not on the KK ESCAPES disk, anyplace despite his great score is on that. Considering either film has not had much rental in the last 20 years, it's a feat these are out on these low-budget DVDs anyway and they aren't panned or scanned or from 16mm.

A good addition to anyone's Kaiju Collection of films(seemingly getting easier in the US as the years go on)",1132963200,7,2686,4.8221258134490235
2417528,5,B000BISBDE,"I have been waiting for years for King Kong vs. Godzilla to be re-released on DVD, and the day is almost here. For the better part of 5 years, since I got my first DVD player, I have been looking on Amazon to see if they will release this movie again on DVD. And now the day is almost here.

As a kid growing up in the 70's I loved the so called ""monster movies"" (Godzilla, King Kong, Mothra, Rhodan, Gammara, Gargantua). My local station was the original WOR in New York and would show these constantly, especially the day after Thanksgiving. I would also love seeing these during the old WABC 4:00 movie in New York when they would show them all week. I don't care how bad the Godzilla or King Kong suits look, how fake the sceneery looks like too, I was just a big fan.

I have King Kong vs. Godzilla on VHS, but I have not watched a VHS tape in years, just to old school to rewind, fast forward, the quality too. But I always held out hope for the day it would be on DVD again. I ordered this the second I saw it available. This is 1000 times better than any of the monster movies that ever came out. Just the campyness of it is enjoyable too. Also there is no annoying soundtrack playing the latest has been top 40 song throughout the movie.

I wish I was a movie producer because I would love to remake King Kong vs. Godzilla. Not a remake of that horrible Matthew Brodderick Godzilla moive (read my review) or the soon to be released ""King Kong"". I want a 200 foot King Kong, not a 40 foot.

Ok, I am being biased. Get this movie, seriously, you will enjoy it. And I like extras, but who wants to see the guy who was in the Godzilla costume talk about (with subtitles) shooting the film. Do you really need to know this ? Most of the extras suck anyway on DVD's. There is a reason why the scene was not in the film, it sucked anyway. And one more thing, they can save 8 minutes on a DVD (or movie) but not crediting EVERYONE who was part of the film. Yes, the director is nice, actors, the producer, but do I really need to know who the personal chef was for the stand-in was ?",1132790400,4,2084,4.1004901960784315
2417529,5,B000BISBDE,"2004-2005 will go down as a banner era for American fans of Kaiju Eiga.  Not only has it seen Sony's superb releases of most of the Showa-era Godzilla films, but Media Blasters' equally-excellent DVDs of other Toho monster classics such as Dogora, Varan the Unbelievable, Atragon and others.

To this noble roster now add Universal's release of King Kong Vs. Godzilla and King Kong Escapes, in anamorphic widescreen.  KK Vs. G is an enjoyable romp, beloved among G-fans for: 1) The fight between the two monsters at the Diet Building in Tokyo; 2) the incredible scene where Kong swings Godzilla around by his tail; and 3) being the first Godzilla film in color.  Yes, the Kong suit is truly goofy, yet both it and the actor inside display loads of personality.  And the film boasts a fine Akira Ifukube score.

But for my money the true gem here is King Kong Escapes.  What makes this film so special can be summed up in one word: Mechani-Kong.  This giant robotic version of the Eighth Wonder is as cool as the shaggy gorilla-suited Kong is goofy, and he certainly ranks as one of the greatest monsters in the Toho pantheon.  If you're a fan of Mechagodzilla (and who isn't?), you owe it to yourself to see his precursor in his only film appearance.  (Icing on the cake: the first appearance of Gorosaurus, Maestro Ifukube's wonderful score, and a deliciously over-the-top performance by Eisei Amamoto as ""Dr. Who"" -- no relation to the famous Timelord!)

When Kong fights Gorosaur and the Water Snake, he kills both like to T-Rex and Serpent, in Cooper's original. Also, the character of Dr. Who, pays homage to William Hartnell's (BBC) Doctor Who.

Japanese monster movies; how do you even defend them? The Kong suit is horrible, but the Godzilla suit is classic. The miniatures are very realistic. The giant octopus in KvG was real! I even hear the director ate it for dinner after shooting; Ha; maybe 'that' should have been in the movie!  Kong Escapes does it's best to cash in on the Bond movie craze, with MechaKong as the ultimate kool gadget...
