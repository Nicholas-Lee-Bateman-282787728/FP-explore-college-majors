We have to accept it: there is a huge difference between this pilot and the Columbo episodes of the first season. For example, PRESCRIPTION: MURDER looks a lot more like a stage play and still belongs to the TV world of the sixties. But there are also in it a few sparkles that announce the grandness of the first episodes. I'm specially thinking here about the scene when Dr. Ray Flemming, a psychiatrist, dissects the way and the recipes Columbo uses with the suspects. This scene alone is worth the 99 minutes of this TV movie.

I was somewhat anxious before watching MURDER BY THE BOOK because I feared that the pleasure I had, during the seventies, to watch Columbo on TV was only associated with my teen years and hadn't pass the test of time. How was I wrong ! The quality of this episode is undeniable, even measured according to our actual standards. Steven Spielberg, who directed MURDER BY THE BOOK, was already yeasty in his direction. He managed to create a suspense drama during the first 15 minutes of the episode while everybody had already understood, since the first 15 seconds of MURDER BY THE BOOK, that Jim Ferris would be murdered by Ken Franklin. The suspense simply lied in the fact that we didn't know how Ferris would do it. Spielberg, with a few Hitchcockian scenes, compelled us to successively believe that Franklin was meant to die poisoned, drowned and shot to death.

Peter Falk is perfect and Jack Cassidy, as the villain, also top-notch. A special mention though to Barbara Colby who, in the role of the blackmailer Lilly LaSanka, shines in all the scenes she appears in.
