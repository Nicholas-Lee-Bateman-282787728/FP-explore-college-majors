2718202,2,B000M2E3G8,"The creators of this movie are honestly insulting our intelligence.  After half way through this movie I couldn't take anymore.  I place this movie in the same waste basket as the new version of the Hitcher and Wolf Creek.  It has the same elements.  The usual car that doesn't start, the chances for the victims to escape that aren't taken for some odd reason, the retarded people that walk right up to the criminals so they can kill them.  To top it all off, it has the girl run out of gas after she starts the truck.  As though they want us to believe that the workers in the woods didn't notice that fact that they wouldn't have had enough gas to made it back themselves!  Enough.  I will not be insulted.  At least give an effort to think of the things people just aren't going to do, and situations that aren't going to happen.",1209945600,,833,4.32258064516129
2718203,1,B000M2E3G8,"This movie is set in an alternate universe where apperently forest workers, policemen and women are incapable of any communication save screaming or gesturing. They also lack the capability of making rational decisions. I think the movie would have been more believable if the heroine was an escaped mute mental patient.

The plot does not contain one twist and constantly repeats. The direction is incredibly slow. Combine with zero dialogue, and you'll feel the need to fast forward. Extra points for the stupid tilted shots trying to get a ""sinister"" feel. Also, the overuse of closeups in all situations makes it impossible to get any physical context.

Another reviewer alluded to the use (root problem) of symbolism in the film. I must admit it didn't even cross my mind while watching, since it was impossible to take the film that seriously.

Extremely boring on all levels. Avoid at all costs.",1196035200,2,902,5.0

2718206,2,B000M2E3G8,"Shot in a harsh mini-DV format with an oversaturation of colors, ""Blood Trails"" is, aesthetically, a visually arresting pic.  Its raw lens is focused mainly on a bike messenger named Anne, whose relationship with her boyfriend, Michael, is on the rocks.  In a weak moment, she agrees to a one-night stand with a steady-eyed bicycle cop (Chris), and immediately regrets it, as Chris gets a little ... weird.  Rueful and ashamed, she tries, the next day, to patch things up with Michael via a nice, quiet bike ride in the woods.

The daytrip turns out to be neither nice nor quiet.  Chris has followed them into the mountainside forests and demands complete possession of Anne, which starts with him dispatching of Michael in a ludicrous and altogether laughable fashion.  The ""horror"" that follows Anne for the rest of this tepid film is, we are meant to realize, the repercusions of her single, adulterous mistake.

The problem is that Anne, like most Slasher Pic Sirens, continues to make mistakes in her attempts to find safety and freedom.  In fact, of the many, many, many horror/killer films I've seen, Anne has got to be, hands-down, the absolute stupidest heroine I have ever had the misfortune to watch.  I wondered, as the film progressed, how any clear-thinking director could expect an audience to find Anne sympathetic, her actions understandable, or her position terrifying.

Not that our villain is any more relatable.  In addition to possessing a humbling silence common for most malicious men, Chris is also, apparantly, an expert tracker with something like superhuman strength and agility.  Neither he nor Anne seem very real until the final scene.  This last burst of full-flowered action is a welcome change of pace, but it is also short and truncated.  One gets the impression that almost the entire movie was made on the basis of this inspired conclusion.

Almost.  It was also (rather obviously) built upon an allegory of self-discovery and sexuality, and this is why -- I believe -- the film fails so fully.  Instead of trying to tell an engaging story of escape and fear, our director and writer (Robert Krause) has lifted a maudlin metaphor out of the cheesiest of self-help books for women and has tried to give it animus and color.  Anne, you see, is running from herself.  Chris, you see, is her unlikely mentor, here to teach her all about the grisly corners of the human soul.  This is why her actions are all so inane -- they are no more or less ridiculous than the rationalizations we use for the most common of human decisions (staying with the abusive spouse, smoking that cigarette, drinking and driving).  In this case, Anne is running not from Chris, but from what she likes about Chris.  Her fear is not that Chris will kill her, but that he WON'T.  Don't you get it?  It's all one.  Big.  Symbol.

It's also one big trainwreck of a film, deeper meanings notwithstanding.  Metaphors and allegories are NO substitute for a good story, I don't care how profound or true the underlying message is.  Krause has got the pacing down.  He knows how to knit together a scene with crisp and crass chromatics.  He even frames his moments rather well.  But if a runner is going nowhere, pacing doesn't matter.  If there is nothing interesting to see, color makes no difference.  And if your Big Message is transmitted by symbols that are hollow and mundane, no amount of clever framing will make them seem anything other than dull.",1175472000,8,3459,4.7969543147208125
2718207,1,B000M2E3G8,"Blood Trails; the story of a woman who - in guilt - gets away from life with boyfriend - who she just cheated on - to attempt to make things better. Too bad for her, her guilt isn't the only thing that follows her into the woods.

 I feel Blood Trails had a lot more potential than it showcased. With what it did show, I didn't particularly enjoy. It was a repeated showcase. After we see the set-up of the cheating, the break-up, the getting back together, and the getting to the cabin woods - we have our leading lady witness a murder, ride on her bike, scream a lot, witness another murder (of a random man in the woods), ride on her bike, scream a lot, witness yet another mother of another random man in the woods, actually get the chance to confront the murderer as to why he's following her, then start riding on her bike and screaming some more.

 I understand that we are led to believe that the chick is helpless and distraught after seeing so much grisly going on. But why not go the helpless gal route, and turn around and go the way you came and find your way to safety instead of riding around and screaming? It became tiring after a while, and eventually bored me to closing my eyes a few times. Only to open them at the sound of chick riding and screaming again.

 There are some little shining moments in this mess, though. The visuals are pretty great. The colors and landscapes all were full and very mood setting. Rebecca Palmer, the lead, finally stopped getting on my nerves when it came to the conclusion in the cabin, and especially when it came to the final shot of the movie. Our resident madman, Tom Frederic, was the only actor to stay strong throughout the entire film. His facial expressions and his eyes did most of the work for him, and that was okay. And there's a nifty ""that would never happen in real life"" kind of kill that I wish was capitalized a little more.

 In the end ... well, that's all I really enjoyed about Blood Trails, was the end. And I mean the end by the last 15 minutes or so. It could have been just a 20 minute short film and it would have been amazing.",1175299200,3,2110,4.2706766917293235

2718209,4,B000M2E3G8,"When it comes to being repulsed by a horror film the most obvious line of demarcation has to do with blood and gore.  There is a whole genre of horror films out there today whose primary intent is not just to make you cover your eyes or turn away, but to puke up your cuts (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw-III/dp/B000LC3ID8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Saw III""</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-Creek/dp/B000EOTVU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Wolf Creek""</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Hostel""</a>&nbsp;are just a few notable examples of this particular genre).  But clearly there are people who do not want to see Hannibal Lecter sauteing slices of someone's brain let along organs and entrails up close and personal.  However, in reading reviews of horror movies and thinking my own personal calculus for evaluating such films I have a working hypothesis that there is a second cinematic element for which viewers have a personal threshold, namely the stupidity of the characters.  This is not restricted to the stereotypical damsel in distress, because the remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Wax/dp/B000BYW706/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""House of Wax""</a>&nbsp;was dominated by the males of the species doing things that made them deserve to die.  That being said, it is the female protagonist who keeps trying to prove she is too stupid to live in a horror film where director Robert Krause (""Checkpoint"") is trying to come up with something different.  The result is a mixed bag.

Rebecca Palmer is Anne, a bike messenger who an unfortunate and quite weird one night stand with Chris (Ben Price), a cycling policeman.  The bad night ends before it goes too far, but Anne is feeling guilty when she and her boyfriend Michael (Tom Frederic) go biking in the mountains together.  Her confession about what happened coincides with Chris' sudden appearance and before Michael can get too mad or fully understand what happened he is dead and Anne is fleeing through the woods with Chris in pursuit.  They are not alone in the woods, which allows Krause to mix up the scenes with Anne on the bicycle with Chris adding to his kill count.  The locale is part of the appeal here, although I do not know if we are talking the Black Forest or Bavarian Alps or whatever (""Blood Trails"" was filmed in Germany, which probably explains why some of the supporting cast never says anything).  Consequently there is a lot more green than you usually see in a slasher film.  Like ""Wolf Creek"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken/dp/B000B7TH92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Broken""</a>&nbsp;this is a survival horror film, with Chris as the cat, Anne as the mouse, and everybody else as road kill.

The film is shot on Mini-DV so the hand-held camera is always in motion and Krause favors close-ups of Anne looking around one side of the tree and then the other, over and over again, trying to spot Chris in the forest (think the look of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B00001MXXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Friday the 13th""</a>&nbsp;but with better images).  The weakness of ""Blood Trails"" is that there are several times when Anne could be safe or able to defend herself and she makes a stupid choice.  One such error, namely the first one, might be forgivable, but after that all bets are off (ask yourself this simple question: you are in a vehicle and a psycho killer is coming after you.  Do you drive away from them or towards them?).  Add that to all of the looking around trees and I was becoming less and less impressed with this 2006 film.  Then we get to the end game and things change dramatically and for the worst (which in a horror film is better).

You would think you know what is going to happen if and when Chris catches Anne, but I found ""Blood Trails"" took a slightly different path at that point, saving what is the scariest part of the film for the last.  Those inclined to cover their eyes at this point will be as likely to do so because of the psychology involved as the blood involved.  I found myself thinking that Chris was really a sick bastard, which is suppose to be true of the slasher in a slasher film, but you do not always feel that and this time I did.  Perhaps the natural beauty of the setting of the rest of the film made this ending seem more intense.  I was distracted by the penultimate deaths in the film, which happen off screen because I do not think they could come up with a realistic way for them to happen, but then we get to the end of this movie and I can tell you that I rounded up here just because of the last shot.  I thought that I was seeing one thing, which would be pretty unique for a horror film, but it turns out Krause was going for a flip of something else.  Most horror films do not save the best for last, but there was enough in the final act here to reverse my thinking about ""Blood Trails.""  Anne is too stupid to live, but this film is not too stupid to see.",1174089600,9,5287,5.2630952380952385
2718210,5,B000M2E3G8,"BLOOD TRAILS is a very calm and precise horror film. It is not a crazy chase slasher type picture, although it does have those traditional moments and they take place on mountain bikes providing a new sort of thrill.

It is a gorgeous looking movie that introduces you to a good looking killer in the opening scene and then spends the rest of the movie nudging our heroine Anne into his arms. It is a romance told through the slasher formula. And this particular courtship is breathtaking and shocking to watch.

Against wide shots of the mountain location(Austria I believe), the personal story of a girl cheating on her boyfriend and regretting how dark the experience got--not the act itself, unfolds in intimate, frantic spurts. She runs, she hides, she asks for help. The killer eliminates all help. This dance eventually forces Anne to confront why she's running, and it is here when the movie goes far beyond the typical horror film. Fans of THE AUDITION will enjoy this intense climax.",1172188800,8,993,4.8011695906432745

8165738,5,B000M2E3G8,"This film made me want to stand up and clap at the end, but I was too emotionally harrowed to do so, that's how good it was.
Even before the tree fell, I was thinking, ""This is a lot like In Fear,"" which is like saying, ""This is a lot like some of the best mint chocolate chip ice cream I've ever tasted in my life."" That good.
The heroine is the BEST scream queen I've seen since discovering Tamin Sursok. That good.
And anyway, isn't it time we cyclists had our own horror movie. Camping pretty much owns the slasher industry, and there have been horrors based on spelunking (Descent), competitive eating (Taxidermia) and taxidermy (again, Taxidermia). The biking shots are just awesome, as is all the nature photography. And unlike a lot of the movies I like, this one seems VERY accessible to the walkaday horror fan. It's foreign, yeah, but other than that nothing especially weird or experimental, just an exercise in taking it to the very edge.",1414281600,,951,4.567251461988304

8165744,3,B000M2E3G8,"The plausibility factor is very low, but the violence, and the action featuring mountain bikes, may provide enough excitement to make the thriller Blood Trails (2006) worth a watch for horror fans.

The story involves Anne (Rebecca Palmer), a biking enthusiast who has an impulsive sexual encounter with Chris (Ben Price) who is apparently a bicycle riding cop.  The day after the incident, Anne and her boyfriend Michael (Tom Frederic), decide to head out of the city and do some mountain bike riding in the wilderness.  The couple take a route that has been closed to the public, and while travelling along, Anne is shocked to see Chris pass them on his bike.  She has just confessed her indiscretion to Michael, when Chris flies out of the woods, and kills Michael with his bike.

The rest of the movie follows Anne's attempts to get away and find help.  Unfortunately, whenever she encounters people, Chris arrives on the scene and kills them.  Anne repeatedly manages to put distance between herself and the axe wielding Chris, but she just can't seem to shake him.  There are some signature scenes, one features Michael's dead body ending up in a most unusual and unlikely location, and another involves Anne riding her bike on a river, and then flying over a waterfall.  She not only survives, but also manages to recover her bike.  Besides being able to track Anne all over creation, Chris conveniently has a cabin nearby in the woods, where he takes Anne and begins to torture her.  When the police unexpectedly arrive, the stage is set for a messy conclusion.

Although most of the violence and mayhem are competently executed, the story doesn't tie them together in any believable way.  No matter what Anne does, like a Michael Myers, Chris always appears close behind.  Rebecca Palmer does fairly well in a physically demanding role, and while Anne never gives up and isn't a complete idiot, there is something about her that makes it a bit difficult to get completely behind her.  Possessive and homicidal, Chris remains a mysterious menace, that soon becomes hard to take seriously.  Preying mostly on the unsuspecting, besides being a decent cook, not much is revealed about him, but Ben Price seems to bring what is required to the role.

Character development is minimal, and the ending kind of plays like the writers ran out of ideas and threw in the towel, but the strong chase element may provide enough for fans of the backwoods horror genre who are not too demanding.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1344643200,,2509,4.836065573770492

Blood Trails is a different type of horror film about a girl being chased by bike (yes, bicycle) through the mountains after having a one night stand with a psycho cop. She is a bicycle messenger and he happens to be a...Bicycle cop. Yes, I know. However there are a few good kill scenes and the gore was decent. The acting is ok but sadly the people are idiots that could have avoided death quite easily had they used common sense. The scene where her boyfriend is killed should provoke a laugh. All in all though if you are looking for a no brainer horror flick this fits the bill. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars but it was a bit entertaining so...",1278028800,,752,4.265734265734266
