8539559,4,B009CF4M0S,"After reading her book, Real Life, Real Health, I got a copy of this DVD directly from Jillian and must say it met all of my expectations!
For months I've been taking a 'Centergy' class at my local fitness center which focuses on Yoga and Pilates exercises. I felt Jillian's Real Serenity Stretch would be great for off days and those times I couldn't attend class and I was correct.

The stretches help me maintain strength and flexibility (both which are important for Centergy) and the relaxation/mediation at the end is very soothing.

I'll be stretching with Jillian on a regular basis!",1441411200,,591,4.784313725490196
8539560,5,B009CF4M0S,"As I watched this video for the first time I experienced a warm and relaxing peace. This video has encouraged me to engage in stretching and relaxation today. I recommend this video for anyone who wants to decrease stress and increase flexibility.

8539561,5,B009CF4M0S,I love this video! The stretches are gentle and yet effective. The stretches can be done even by beginners. These stretches prepare me for relaxation and serenity. This is a perfect video if you are a beginner or older and don't think you can get you body into a pretzel anymore. The yoga covered in this video stretches all major muscle groups keeping you flexible and agile.,1436140800,,376,4.626865671641791
