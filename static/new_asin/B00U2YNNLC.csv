8704099,2,B00U2YNNLC,"Acting was not bad, production and direction ok for a found footage film. Story went nowhere and made no sense. Characters not that distinguishable, there's a guy with an accent, a woman, and two dudes that look too much alike.

The writing is not always horrible, as there's some good tension among the characters from time to time. Although to be fair, sometimes I couldn't tell what the damn tension was about, aside from the fact that they were all a bunch of big babies lost in the woods. Other than this, the only other tension comes from the viewer wondering if anything interesting or scary is ever going to happen (as someone has already mentioned).

Also, no actual hulk blood. Go figure.",1506470400,,698,4.666666666666667
8704100,1,B00U2YNNLC,"The ""found footage"" subgenre is a plague.  It's only been done well a handful of times, typically it's used as an excuse to circumvent any real creativity because aspiring filmmakers see it as an easy path.  After about the first 15 minutes or so of this movie, NOTHING HAPPENS.  Some really stupid and unresourceful young people find themselves in circumstances which smart, resourceful people could get out of in a very short amount of time.  The only tension is from wondering when anything interesting is going to happen, and SPOILER::::::::::::: nothing does.  If anybody follows my reviews, they're going to think ""wow, this dude hates everything"" and that's not true at all.  Typically the only time I'm motivated to review a movie on Amazon is if I think I can help somebody avoid wasting their time the way I did.  Leave this one alone.",1504396800,4,845,4.826388888888889
8704101,1,B00U2YNNLC,Nothing happened. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting.  Just a bunch of boring whiners lost in the woods.  Maybe that swamp water should've turned that guy into a lunatic and really made it interesting.,1504137600,,205,4.828571428571428

8704104,1,B00U2YNNLC,"A very realistic candidate for most boring movie ever made. I don't even want to call it ""bad"" because really bad movies have a certain amount of fun to them. Here, though, we just have some very crudely written characters wandering through the woods for an hour and some, with a wraparound of strangely low quality ""new footage"".",1503792000,,330,4.706896551724138
8704105,3,B00U2YNNLC,"As a fan of the Blair Witch Project and found footage films in general, I don't get what the point of this movie was or what the film maker was going for.  Found footage films can be slow, but this story literally goes nowhere.  Nothing happens.  I'm giving this 3 stars because maybe I just didn't get what they were going for with this film.  I think maybe they tried to do something different, but I have never seen a found footage film like this before.  I can't recommend it even to fans of the genre.",1503100800,4,506,4.229166666666667
