8581128,1,B00CF0EUKY,"Why is this release still being offered if they haven't addressed the problem reported by two other reviewers? I, too, got to the last thirty seconds or so of one of the great climaxes in all classical music -- and then it's cut off as the disc ends. Don't buy this without knowing the problem has been addressed, or at least play the very end of the piece within the return window. I was developing a high opinion of ArtHaus releases, but this just blows that up for me.",1530921600,,471,4.303370786516854
8581129,2,B00CF0EUKY,"I have the same problem that Mr. Cornelius had, with an abrupt cut-off of the final movement.
I'm hoping my replacement copy will correct the problem. The performance, video and sound
are all first rate, what we have come to expect from Jansons after the great Beethoven symphony
box. How about a Brahms set Mariss, as the Thielmann has great sound, but irritating performances?

Alas the replacement had the same defect, and although my money was refunded, I still do not have
a good copy.  Writing to the manufacturer evinced no response.  I would have to say you are taking
a big risk ordering this, although the sound and performance are wonderful---best of class",1431820800,,667,4.833333333333333
8581130,5,B00CF0EUKY,"This is probably the definitive blu-ray version of Mahlers 2nd symphony! Janssons directing i stunning! The voices of Argentine mezzo-soprano Bernarda Fink and German soprano Anja Harteros, together with the magnificent playing and singing of the Bavarian orchestra and chorus, is remarkable right from climaxes of sonic proportions to the high strings playing the softest pianissimo. Bravo!

I compared with Abbado/Lucerne festival, which also is fine. But as it is older, it suffers from some audio issues. Another comparision with Boulez/Staatskapelle Berlin , which have a wonderful demonstration quality sound. But Boulez ice cold directing is not a pleasure to see. And that blu-ray has no subtitles, unfortunately.
Now we have to wait for another Mahler symphony with Jansons!",1422403200,2,783,5.579831932773109
8581131,5,B00CF0EUKY,"First off all, my Blu-ray played fine...no glitches. Secondly, this a moving performance that is vivid and alive on Blu-ray, with Jansons in top form.  Director Brian Large does a superb job with a variety of perspectives....including shots of the full orchestra, something that is often missing in many splice and dice productions.  Those who love the Mahler 2nd will find this Blu-ray well worth the purchase.",1374710400,4,411,5.119402985074627
8581132,5,B00CF0EUKY,"I loved the performance and the recording, but unfortunately the ending is cut off prematurely right after the chorus cuts out.  The ending is truncated (missing about 45 seconds)  It goes from track 7 right into track 8 that says ""mastered by..""  Somebody in the editing department did not do their job.  Has anyone else had this problem?

Upon reading the second review I ordered a new copy and it plays perfectly.  My rating goes from 1 to 5, as this is a sincere and heartfelt performance.  The recording is much superior than his previous recording with the Royal Concertgebouw which is marred by excessive audio compression.  Would that recording engineers leave the dynamics alone!",1372464000,12,688,4.921739130434783
