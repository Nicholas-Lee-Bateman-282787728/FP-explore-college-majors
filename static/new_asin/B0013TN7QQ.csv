8252857,3,B0013TN7QQ,"This old classic video is for the fan of the old InFisherman programs with Al Lindner at the helm. This is the first video that I rented to learn something about musky fishing many years ago, before DVD, when I first started chasing muskies. It's just good fun, and there's still relevant information that a beginner would find helpful. You will learn about two popular jerk baits, using the wind to locate muskies, the figure 8 movement and other topics. And you get a look at some great musky fishing history as well.",1429228800,,519,4.591397849462366
