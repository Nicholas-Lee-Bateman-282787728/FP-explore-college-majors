7957632,5,B000060MYK,"America's Hottest Strip Clubs offers a sampling of of about a dozen top strip clubs around the US. These are all nude clubs and the dancers are shown on stage showing off their dance and strip tease skills to the audiences in each club. Unlike some other strip club reviews where you can't really appreciate the dancers due to poor lighting or camera work, this collection does a good job of keeping the camera angles clear and up close when necessary so you can see all of each dancer's grace and hidden charms being displayed on stage",1354665600,,536,4.536082474226804
7957633,5,B000060MYK,"Our male announcer says that we're going to see ""some of America's sexiest, most uninhibited women"". He doesn't say we're going to be having uninhibited cameramen or uninhibited editing, but more on that later.
  We get some women with implants, and some natural, but I hardly saw any tatoos.
  We start out with good music, good camerawork, and Heather at the Foxy Lady Club in Boston. She has on a black cowboy hat, a black vest with a silver star, chaps, and is packing a couple six-guns that glow at the tip when she pulls the trigger, but not to worry, she soon takes everything off (except for her black cowboy boots-- I always hate long boots on strippers). She's pretty sexy. She has long black hair, and I really love the way she flops her long hair around. It is believed that she has implants, but her surgeon did a good job on her, and a person could be forgiven if they mistake her for being natural.
  I'll touch mostly on the women & clubs that I liked, or that stuck out in my mind for one reason or another. One of the next clubs is Deja Vu in North Hollywood, a club I have visited a few times. We get three girls on stage at once, but they seem clueless about what to do with each other. But, at least we get good music.
  After a while we come to Heven at Stars Cabaret in Portland, with good music, and good camerawork. She seems that she has implants, but this segment at Stars Cabaret is fun to watch in large part due to the crowd around the stage.
  In Portland we get Destiny, with fake tits, on the main stage, and Jena Zane in the VIP lounge. See, the camera skips back & fourth between them. Jena Zane is really pretty and seems natural, but she has her nipples pierced. It always gives me the willies when I see a female with her nipples pierced. Destiny and Star get to dance to fairly good music.
  Eventually we move on to Deja Vu in Las Vegas, which is probably the  darkest club on the whole DVD. See, not much light. Becky Sunshine lives up to her name in that she does the tan-white-parts thing. The tan-white-parts thing is when a female wears a bikini and goes out and gets sunburned like crazy and tanned, and then the rest of us are supposed to think it's so sexy to see the white parts of her where her bikini top and bottoms used to be.
  Then we have Samantha on the main stage and Honey in the VIP lounge. The camera skips back & forth between them. They have to make do with awful music; and, actually, we hardly get to see Honey, i.e., the camera doesn't spend much time on her...and I wanted to see more of Honey.
  Next up on our tour is Mons Venus in Tampa ""if you're looking for the very best in full contact lap dancing""; and this is where I almost had a heart attack, because of what the customers get to do with their hands and-- in the case of one guy, at least-- their mouths during lap dances. There was a good selection of pretty females, some natural, perhaps some with implants; and, oh yes, some with the tan-white-parts thing. But I perhaps saw few, if any, tatoos.
  We get to the Foxy Lady Club in Providence, which is a pretty dark club, with porn princess Ava Vincent and a ""lucky local"" Skyla on stage making out with each other, but they could be doing a little better job of making out with each other. Then at the Foxy Lady, Paris is on the main stage and April is in the VIP room, with the camera alternating back and forth between them. April is someone I could get a crush on or could fall in love with, but we hardly see April (because the camera doesn't spend much time on her). While we can't see April a whole lot, the cameraman does a good job on Paris.
  We get more light on the subject(s)-- for a while-- at Deja Vu in Minneapolis, where Baby is on the main stage and Nahomi is in the VIP Room, and the camera alternates between them. Baby is a real babe with a nice natural figure with no tatoos.
  In the next segment at Deja Vu in Minneapolis we get six girls at once on stage. These girls are uninhibited, with one girl leaning back on the stripper pole and having her hands tied up above her head to the stripper pole, while other girls apply their hands and mouths to her, and then another girl gets tied up (with one hand tied to one pole and another hand tied to another pole), and other girls are making out with each other, too. EXCEPT the camera work and editing let us down by being inhibited. Too much of the girl on girl action is shown from an angle where we can't see very well what's going on. Also, it is very dark, and the music is crummy.
  At Le Girls in Phoenix, ""our first desert fox is not only stacked, she's all natural"", and this would be Chazelle, my favorite girl on the whole DVD, but we hardly get to see her. The camera work on her isn't as good as I would've liked, and the few times when we do get to see her, it is often a back view. Also, Le Girls needs to screw in a few more light bulbs in order to have more light, and they need to turn the smoke machine off every now and then.
  After Chazelle's dance is finished, three girls come out on stage; but, yes, it's still too dark. These three girls spend too much time & energy putting baby oil over each other, when they should be spending more of their time & energy applying their mouths and hands to each other.
  Last up on our odyssey is Hawaii, where there is awful music, and it is way too dark again. (A number of clubs in this DVD seem interested in competing for the title of Darkest Strip Club.) Kimmy is on the main stage and Jenny Ann is in the Vip Lounge, with the camera alternating between them. Kimmy is cute with a nice natural figure and no tatoos, and Jenny Ann might be natural, too; but Jenny Ann goes for the tan-white-parts thing. And then at the very last there in Hawaii (and at the very last of our DVD) we have Krista on the main stage and Ariel doing a so-called shower dance. It may be cutesy for Krista to be doing a shower dance, but the makers of the DVD forgot that we need to SEE her, and it's way too dark or there are bad camera angles or whatever, and we scarcely see Krista.
  It's a pretty good DVD, and I could recommend it. Parts of it realistically show strip clubs, but there perhaps is more to life and entertainment than being realistic, and lot of these clubs need to have more light on the subject.",1208908800,7,6315,4.172839506172839
