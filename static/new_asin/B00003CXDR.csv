1281776,5,B00003CXDR,"I thought that Titan A.E. was a wonderful movie. The voice acting was good, the special effects were excellent, two thumbs up.",965952000,,126,4.7727272727272725
1281777,5,B00003CXDR,"When I saw Titan AE in the cinema, my instincts told me it was going to be good. But I was not prepared for the visual explosion of imagination that  kept my jaw open for most of the running time! The character too are  engaging, especially the main character Cale and the alien comic reliefs.  But outer space itself is the real star. These great film makers made space  what it should be -- full of incredible wonders. Whether it be the hydrogen  trees, or the Drej nebula, or the AWESOME ice crystals that float and clash  with each other and reflect passing ships in every facet. Crank up the  sound and watch it in DVD quality splendor!",965952000,,641,4.38135593220339
1281778,2,B00003CXDR,"I was hooked by this movie last summer when I was the trailer before Star Wars Episode 1, and after a year of waiting I couldn't wait to see it. I  was first off disappointed that this movie was your standard pen and paper  animation and not cgi, which the trailer led me to believe. Also, the  special effects were a real let down, there were some scenes very well  done, but many others that looked like they were quickly slapped together.  I don't recommend buying this movie, just rent it first to see if its turns  your fancy. For me I didn't like it at all.",965952000,3,563,4.214953271028038
1281779,1,B00003CXDR,"the movie started off well, with the scene when the earth blew up. i thought that was really cool. the drej actually looked like they would be  almost invincible, but they aren't. i actually felt emotion when the movie  started.  but this movie lacks a lot of things, and if you really think  about it, is a paradox. when we actually see the drej on the attack, we  learn that they are pretty easy to kill. i mean the creatures in  ""Aliens"" were tougher than these pieces of energy. you just shoot  them and they blow up. it makes you wonder why we were so afraid of them in  the first place.  the paradox in the story lies in the titan itself. the  drej want to destroy the humans because they have the titan AE. the titan  AE was built to build another planet when the drej decide to destroy the  humans. my question is simply this, if the humans didn't build the titan in  the first place, would the drej really want to kill the humans? and if the  drej are so easy to kill, why couldn't we just fight them in the first  place, and not flee our mother planet? without these kinds of paradoxes the  movie was pretty good. but these paradoxes make the movie never even get  off the ground.",965952000,8,1190,4.241071428571429
1281780,5,B00003CXDR,"It's a crying shame that this movie only made up 24 million dollars of its 90 million dollar budget in its short theater run, but I am so delighted  that we don't have to wait long for the DVD.
Titan A.E. has some of the  most imaginative, beautiful visuals I have ever, ever, ever seen.  Sweeping  space scenes simply immerse you in this well-crafted, dark universe.  All  this set to a really great soundtrack produced entirely for the movie.  It's the animated space opera for which I've been waiting for a long time,  and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is hungry for a good  story with an INCREDIBLE amount of duly impressive, hauntingly brilliant  CGI work.",965952000,,681,4.6
1281781,4,B00003CXDR,"A cool experiment, blending traditionally drawn animation w/ the latest & greatest CGI.  Only problem is that the drawn stuff looks pretty  bland in comparison at times.  The CGI is incredible - maybe more  believable than in other movies because one can accept a lot more, knowing  that it's intended to be animated, rather than pose as reality. It's a fun  & harmless (with some violence that may be tough for the youngest  viewers - definitely PG13) story; nothing too complicated & easy to  follow.  The voices, on the whole, were adequate with the exception of  Leguizamo, who's character & voice virtually made the show. Give it a  shot!",965865600,9,643,4.807339449541284
1281782,5,B00003CXDR,"Ok, so the film bombed, and killed ANY chance to see another spectacular film like this from Fox Studios ever again. I hope it will get much more  attention on DVD then it did in theatres. Hopefully it will also have alot  of fun and cool features for the fans.
This movie shows that Disney isn't  the only ones with animation talent. But unlike Disney Fox isn't afraid to  market to an older audience. The characters are all very cool, with an  original plot to boot! Some neat plot twists along the way, and VERY VERY  VERY cool animation mixed BEAUTIFULLY with the best special effects you'll  ever see in an animated film. This movie wasn't predictable, and kept me  guessin HOW it was gonna all end. The ending is a stretch of the  imagination. I did notice someone mutter how ""impossible"" it was.  But this is science fiction! who cares! My only problem is that it ended  too quickly,  I would've enjoyed  it even more  had it been 2 hrs. The  voice talents are great, but at times unrecognizable (I didn't know John  Leguizamo was in it till I saw the credits.) I also wanna mention the  AWESOME music!  Its all rock and you'll be moshing in your seat as it keeps  the movie rolling along smoothly.
My favorite scene is when Matt Damons  character is flying the ship along with the wake angels. That was pure eye  candy, and I can't wait to see this movie again on video! I'll be first in  line to get it on DVD! Way to go FOX! Too bad this movie will be the last  of it's kind.",965865600,129,1485,4.300724637681159

1281784,5,B00003CXDR,"Recentley I had the pleasure of viewing what I believe to be the best animated film in quite awhile. Titan A.E. is a marville in its animation, storyline, and use of twists, turns, and humor. This is the kind of movie  that makes you lean back in you seat and smile. There are some magical  movies out there that give someone goosebumps. This is one of them. A  spectacular adventure about a boy who gets seperated from his father as an  alien species attacks the earth. The boy grows up but looses all pride in  the human race. Tword the end of the movie he realizes why his father did  what he had to do, and what he now has to do. You will not soon forget this  film.",961977600,18,670,4.147286821705427

1282146,2,B00003CXDR,"The pros:
Some good CGI scenery for the time
The effort to try something different, as in an all sci fit story with no superheroes
It has a cult following

The Cons:
Horrible voice acting. Flat performances. Also hard to hear.
The 2D images of the people were not half as good as stuff Ive seen from the 1980s
The punk rock music didn't match the events. It would constantly rip you out of the movie.
The story was a mess. It lacked cohesiveness. Bad guys were bad because they were just that.. bad.
The characters had no development or little interaction with one another that they were unlikable.",1509235200,,598,4.486238532110092

1282235,3,B00003CXDR,"Brat discovers father

Take a formula story; add celebrity voices to distract you, throw in graphics that you would not know was better if they did not yell it at you every chance they get. And you have Titan A.E.

If this is supposed to be 3'D a D is missing. It is slightly better than the standard Anime. They fill in the slow spaces while the graphics are catching up to the story with crude imitations of contemporary bubble gum music.

The story is formula. The characters are stilted and the technology is not.

###don't look at the image unless you've already seen the movie###
So my girlfriend suggested we watch this movie because she thought it was good. So her, myself, and my good friend Brent are watching this movie and at the end of the movie Brent would not stop shouting ""LOOK GUYS WE MADE A PLANET!!!"" Like, he is so angry at the end of this film he stays at my house for a solid 5 extra minutes just getting more and more mad about the ending of this movie. At the end of the day, I have to agree the ending is total nonsense, but if you're a kid then who cares? I'll tell you who cares, my friend Brent cares. A lot. As he headed home he proceeded to fill our group chat shouting angrily about the ending of this movie. Seriously, you all should have been there, I'm sad I didn't think to record it with my phone or else that would have been uploaded with this review.

If you want to make a scientist mad and shout in your house for about 5-7minutes, 11/10

1282599,4,B00003CXDR,"Titan AE is another one of those forgotten works with a great concept that just never got off the ground somehow. Its main detractions are the somewhat uncertain tone, slightly hackneyed dialogue, and occasional tendency to fall back on outdated tropes, but otherwise it's great.

I hope I'm not making this sound like a bad movie, because it's not a bad movie at all. The basic storyline is that after Earth was destroyed by the alien Drej army, humanity is drifting through the galaxy in grimy, somewhat outdated starships. The reasoning and science behind some of this isn't so clear, but in the end you don't care too much. California-guy-handsome salvage worker Cale is stranded on a junky space station cutting up old wrecks for a pittance and bad food when the Valkryie ship comes around with Han Solo archetype Joseph Korso, a couple of funky aliens, sensible, sarcastic, lowbrow gorgeous pilot Akima Kunimoto (who's probably the best character in the film), and, of course, the Drej hot on their tails out of hyperspace. Cale learns he has a map to something called the Titan, which will create a new Earth through some more sketchy science we don't care too much about, and the Drej show up, gun-arms ready. Chaos ensues, things explode, and the Valkryie heads off on a wild-goose chase around the galaxy to find the Titan before the Drej do and look cool in the process.

The concepts of humanity adrift in ship colonies and a slick, terrifying, energy-based alien species are great, but it's the visuals that really make the film. Asteroids and moons, the endless drift of hyperspace, gorgeous alien planets, grimy Star Wars-esque spaceships with equally grimy and comfortable interiors with lots of little glowing lights, the works. Good stuff, and it looks perfect in the film's comic-booky animation style. Both Cale and Akima get equal opportunities to shoot snark and laser guns and save each other's butts. The overall look and feel is pretty PG-13- a bit of blood and some implied adult humor, but nothing major. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is probably the closest corollary here. All the characters wear work clothes and bits of military uniform straight out of Firefly or Star Wars, which makes sense considering Joss Whedon was involved in the film. For his part as well, there's a great sense of equality in the bit of fanservice that does show up. There's nothing super risqu, but both Cale and Akima get one sorta-hot scene each, two for Cale even, depending on how you're counting.

The ending of the film is sorta final, but not completely so, definitely leaving the door open if you'd rather interpret it that way. All in all, Titan AE is a great little space opera that's somehow gotten lost beneath a slew of other movies not necessarily an improvement over it. Grab a snack, make sure not to spill it on your favorite Star Wars shirt, and enjoy.",1473292800,,2874,4.813765182186235

As a child, I never really cared for it, my brother always watched it and i remember seeing some scenes but still really didn't care.  It wasn't until I found the VHS and a VHS player and basic knowledge on common electronic video and audio viewing devices that I decided to watch it.  At first I felt like i was forcing myself to watch it, but a few minutes in I quickly became quite interested.  After the cafeteria scene when the dredge decided to stop on by for a shoot out with Cale and Korso, that went on to a very fast paced and high speed chase through the facility, lasers flying everywhere lighting up everything (if you have epilepsy, be cautioned), it was at that point i became glued to the screen.

The story line is pretty basic, Earth gets destroyed by aliens (the dredge) and the remaining humans fight to survive in space via scavenging for parts left over from Earth as well as alien hardware.  While all that is going on Korso is convincing Cale about a ship that will rebuild a new planet for the humans.  That is the very straight forward plot line, but there is a lot added to the mix making it quite a bit more complex, including 2 or 3 plot twists, a few useless but entertaining scenes as well as vital scenes that if you miss, you'll be thrown off and wonder what the f*** is going on.  Like other reviewers said nearly 16 years ago (crazy to think it's been that long), there are a few things that have no explanation, but with a little thought and logical explanation, you can quickly put a good deal of it together.  Things like the humans being able to understand the dredge language, well the movie wouldn't be able to happen if they weren't able to understand, it's basic sci-fi, and who knows, there are lots of creatures out there with language capabilities, so at some point in time someone must have taught the humans dredge.  The only one impossible scene that really bugs me, is when Cale and Korso's escape pod glass breaks directly after they escaped the facility and were exposed to the near perfect vacuum of space (read very bottom to continue on this topic)

I would say that this movie is quite unique because while it is animated, it's aimed more for teenagers and young adults.  In a few scenes, it does have feather light language, but enough to know it's not for fragile humans under 10.  Some of the scenes also... not for fragile humans under 10.  I strongly agree with the other reviewers, it is very sad that this didn't supersede disney movies at the time, because, you know, disney has a monopoly on just about every animated movie, so naturally this one, this masterpiece, didn't take off (no pun intended if you've seen the movie).  I believe that had disney not had any movies out at the time, which would've been impossible, this would have gained a substantial amount of publicity than its maiden viewing.  I believe that in a separate universe, disney went down the drain, and fox took the lead.

Why did Cale and Korso being exposed to space bug me? (Discretion Advised)
Lets start with the very basic and obviousness that it is space, a place you need to wear a suit to be in, but in a vacuum, the boiling point of water is reduced depending on how great the vacuum is, and the human body consists of 70-80% water, so a lot of water.  The human body is also full of air (e.g. lungs, stomach, intestines) which when exposed to space, escape so rapidly, your lungs, stomach and intestines whatever else would all burst, the air escaping through your mouth, nose and @$$.  Your ear drums would rupture pretty much instantaneously.  Then all that liquid that is inside you, like your blood, all 4 quarts, the liquid in your skin cells, etc, would all begin to boil, as a result, all the veins in your eyes and your body would burst, and you would inflate like a balloon, your skin separating from your flesh and bones.  In the vacuum, the water in your cells in your skin and all your internal organs would start to burst like the over inflated microscopic balloons they've become.  During this process, which happens in less than 2 seconds, you would remain conscious for about 10 to 15 seconds as oxygen seizes to be supplied to the brain, but the brain has also been exposed to space, and also has expanded as a result of being exposed to this near perfect vacuum, so you would have traumatic memory loss, traumatic loss of motor skills, traumatic loss of sensory, and any pain you have felt literally all over and inside of your body quickly goes away.  Since there is no air in space, there is really no median for the heat from your body to escape, so your formless mass of flesh would actually stay quite warm for quite some time before freezing into a disgustingly disfigured chunk of ice and then falling back down to Earth, and burning up in the atmosphere, but in the movie, there is no Earth, some alien may find you and eat you.  But of course that couldn't happen in the movie because then we'd wind up with a 15 or 20 minute long movie with an extremely disturbing ending and a lot of p*ssed off viewers.",1453507200,,5090,4.466019417475728

1283280,5,B00003CXDR,"Titan A.E. is such a good movie that it transcends the boundaries of being a ""Great Animated Movie"" & is Worthy of ranking up in the top 20 Science Fiction movies of all time!!!  The soundtrack alone takes & kicks this movie up a couple of notches in the SCI-FI genre because instead of overwhelming orchestration or electronic farts & blurps that are so common in the genre the soundtrack aids in character development, Like the music we listen to is the soundtrack of our life's, the music in Titan A.E. sound's like the music the character's in the movie would be listening to.  The fact that critic's bashed the film means nothing to me...Critic's have been missing the boat since I can remember...these are the same stuffed shirt types that turned down ""The Beatles"" debut music!!!  The proof is in the people.  Titan A.E. was almost a instant cult classic & as time rolls by its popularity gains & gains.  Like most truly great things the truest test of quality comes from the fan's & word of mouth sharing of the movie or music in this case even the Titan A.E. soundtrack stands on its own.  The Animation for this movie is a mix between classic art style & C.G.I. and when both are done with good quality there's nothing wrong with that.  As far as making comparison's to other movie's in the genre I could pick apart any of the highly acclaimed classics & point out pre existing material that could have been borrowed to create ""Star Wars"" & every other movie in the genre.  The point is Titan A.E. is fresh, exciting & simple a satisfying SCI-FI Action adventure!  If you don't have fun watching this movie you better check your pulse...or even worse your soul!!!  For all those hating on this movie all I can do is ask them ""Don't you remember being young?""  ""Have you ever beaten the odd's & done what others believed impossible?"" ""Has life beaten you down so far that you have no hope?""  After all that's what this movie is all about!!!  Don't let evil take away your JOY in life!!!!

1283527,4,B00003CXDR,"This is the movie that killed Fox Animation Studios.  The critics weren't that crazy about it and it failed miserably at the box office.  (It couldn't compete with Toy Story 2.)  It lost 60% of its audience in its second weekend after only opening at number five with its premiere.  Part of its problem is the use of stock characters to tell a standard adventure yarn.  A little boy is separated from his father by an attack on Earth by a race of aliens called the Drej.  They destroy Earth and vow to annihilate all Earthlings.  Why?  Why is never adequately stated, you're just supposed to accept the fact and everything that follows.  Such as the little boy growing into a crabby sarcastic young man with an attitude problem (Cale Tucker, as droned by Matt Damon) and a map hand.  This is such a clich, the reluctant hero with a chip on his shoulder, more of a hindrance than a champion.  He's soon aided and abetted by the usual roster of wacky characters (some nice, some suspicious).  Their goal is to find the vessel his dad took off in when everyone was escaping from Earth.  The problem is, too many others are also searching for this famed vessel, the Titan.  We have a plethora of bad guys, with the Drej being the most enigmatic.  The story is a quest.  It plays out like a quest.  It doesn't offer anything fresh or inspired.  What it does have though is dazzling artwork (half is hand drawn, most is computer generated).  For me, that's the main appeal of this otherwise routine action flick.  The artwork is impressive.  The story and character (voice actors), not so much.",1426377600,,1588,4.540636042402827

1283633,4,B00003CXDR,"Titan A.E. is one of those movies that has great animation and a great story, but suffers from an identity crisis. Is it a childrens film or is it geared towards an older audience? The problem is the film incorporates elements from the two age genres in a way that tends to alienate both audiences. Still in spite of this Titan A.E. is a thoroughly enjoyable film with dynamic action, beautiful backdrops, intriguing story and that signature animation style from Don Bluth. But it's not for young children.

The story is a bleak one on the outset. Earth is destroyed by an alien race called the Drej, who feel threatened by humanity's latest and greatest achievement: The Titan Project. Fast forward to 15 years later and the remaining humans are scattered across the cosmos in makeshift colonies: slowly wasting away into eventual extinction. Cale (Matt Damon) is the unknown owner of a secret map that reveals the location of the hidden Titan Project, and is recruited by a band of humans and aliens who are seeking out humanity's last hope for survival. All the while the Drej are also after Cale so they can eliminate the human's biggest threat to them once and for all.

As bleak as it all sound I like the story. They do a good job of showing Earth's devastation without glorifying the calamity, and you get a good idea of what's like to be a human in a universe where you're considering nothing without a homeworld. There are plot twists along the way and feel typical, but are done in a way that doesn't insult your intelligence or fell all that derivative. The problem I have in the writing is some of the comical characters that are put in that really don't feel like they fit. This movie has some semi-graphic violence in it, and seeing alien characters act all goofy feels very out of place. I am guessing Don Bluth's children's oriented past felt compelled to add this stuff to an otherwise mature film.

From the outset the draw of this film should be the animation. Don Bluth is one of those rare animators that kept alive the traditional cell animation from Disney's golden age and utilizes it to its very limits. Titan A.E. is in a way a pinnacle representation of that animation. Bluth uses techniques that give traditional animation a fluidity and life you aren't use to seeing in your everyday cartoon. Special effects are also done in this traditional way, which puts a certain charm in the movie you no longer see elsewhere. I noticed a few cell animated sequences that are a challenge to put together done here effectively. This is even more impressive considering the film's budget was cut or constricted a few times by the executives at Fox.

Don Bluth may be a traditionalist, but he's not a luddite. I believe this is Bluth's first use of computer generated animation and it's blended with the cell animation nicely. Mostly the spaceships and the Drej themselves are CG animated along with a few other details, but most of the film is cell animated. Since the movie was made in 2000 (and done on a budget) the computer animation isn't going to be stand out impressive for today's audiences, and you can even notice some technical limitations in some rare scenes (slow moving Drej queen for instance), but this is computer animation made to gel with the cell animation. So realism wasn't the focus. While you can tell the difference between the two they compliment instead of detract from each other. The end result is a beautiful looking movie with a lot of dynamic action, pretty scenery, and all in all lots of eye candy.

Aside from the childish demeanor of some of the alien characters I was also put back by the soundtrack for this film. Lots of 90's sounding artists singing in the background. This makes the movie sound cheap like they couldn't make their own effective soundtrack so they relied on rock bands to popularize the film. It also makes the film sound dated from the get go, and now you are listening popular music styles of the 20's century instead of being whisked away to the 30th century.

The DVD looks pretty good for DVD standards, but this film really could use a Blu-Ray transfer what with all the awesome visuals. The Special Edition DVD goes come with an impressive amount of extras though. Here's the breakdown:

Commentary - Directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman have worked together on many notable projects like The Secret of Nimh and Anastasia. They have a rapport with each other that makes for an informative commentary. Interesting to hear about the limitations they went through as well as discussions on the animation techniques. This is a pretty honest and revealing commentary with little filler.

The Quest for the Titan - This is a relatively short promotional documentary that was shown on FOX TV to promote the film. Unlike most promotional pieces this one is actually chock full of interviews with cast and crew members, behind the scenes footage of the animation process, test footage and all of it informative instead of just fluff to sell the film. I wish more promotional featurettes were like this.

Deleted and Alternate Scenes - There is one deleted scene with some useful dialog between Cale and Korso (Bill Pullman) and an extended Akima (Drew Barrymore) rescue scene that has parts not completely animated. Both scenes would have been nice to be on the movie and are short enough to not have messed with the running time. I am guessing budget constraints pulled them. There are also two alternate scenes of the ice field and final battle that aren't completely animated. Not much difference between the alternate and the theatrical if you ask me.

Music Video - the band Lit and their song Over My Head

Image Gallery - Over 100 photos including concepts and designs that weren't on the film. Cool stuff.

Trailers - Includes two theatrical trailers and two television commercials.

DVDROM - Just web links to useless stuff.

Titan A.E. is a good film that was mired by a few bad calls, but it is still a very good film. If you are a science fiction fan there is a lot to love here. If you are an animation fan, especially the traditional cell kind, there is a whole lot to love here. Titan A.E. didn't do well in theaters, but I believe it deserves some recognition as being a film with a great story and excellent animation.",1422576000,,6308,4.691681735985534

1283862,4,B00003CXDR,"After the resounding success that was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anastasia/dp/B004K00NMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anastasia</a>, directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman's next project was seemingly determined by the Fox producers spinning them around and pushing them in whatever direction they ended up facing. This turned into ""Titan A.E.,"" the first pure science-fiction feature for the duo. It became one of the most unique pictures they'd make and, disappointingly, the last one they'd produce as of this writing, thanks to the folding of Fox Animation Studios and the Bluth/Goldman team being relegated to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/smaller-and-more-obscure-projects/dp/B00009XS6F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">smaller and more obscure projects</a>. Nevertheless, the movie is fun enough that I still hope its audience expands beyond its cult following. Fans of both animation and action won't go wrong.

The story: in the aftermath of the Earth's destruction by the sinister Drej, a young rogue (voiced by Matt Damon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Trilogy/dp/B003H6KRIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Trilogy</a>) joins a dysfunctional crew of spacefarers to save the last chance of a future for the human race - an enigmatic machine called the Titan.

The fact that the movie didn't do well at the box office is no reason to disregard it. ""Titan A.E."" is part of a string of animated sci-fi adventures released by different studios - including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Iron-Giant/dp/B00009M9BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Iron Giant</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Treasure-Planet/dp/B007KUFDBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Treasure Planet</a>&nbsp;- that inexplicably underperformed when first released but proved more popular on the video market. And while it's a bit harder to argue for the timelessness of this film when compared to Bluth's most famous works, ""Titan A.E."" is very fun. Co-penned by Joss Whedon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-s-The-Avengers/dp/B0083SBMBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel's The Avengers</a>), the screenplay is fairly witty and incredibly active from start to finish. There's more action here - laser shootouts, space dogfights, and even the odd hand-to-hand brawl - than virtually any other traditionally-animated American feature carrying a PG rating (I can see a lot of anime fans going for this one). The voice acting is solid from start to finish, with particularly memorable performances being turned in by Nathan Lane (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-King/dp/B00003CXB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion King</a>) and John Leguizamo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ice-Age-series/dp/B000GUJYGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ice Age series</a>) as alien crewmembers.

Nevertheless, there are some problems that keep this one from a perfect rating, and they have to do with the writing. Foremost, Matt Damon's lead hero has his moments but otherwise swings between being bland and unlikeable; I have the impression that the filmmakers made him by trying to fuse&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Luke-Skywalker-and-Han-Solo/dp/B00E9PMMX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Luke Skywalker and Han Solo</a>&nbsp;into a single character, but without any of the charm. Additionally, there is at least one major flaw in the pacing, namely in the rapid capture, ejection, recapture, and rescue of Akima (Drew Barrymore,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-s-Angels/dp/B002A5EBMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie's Angels</a>). This could easily have been its own arc, but it's resolved in less than ten minutes and develops neither the story nor any character. Lastly, the ambiguity regarding the film's central conflict is a drawback: we never find out why the Drej are hostile towards humanity, and while this vagueness is easy to digest at first, repeated viewings make me wonder whether the writers ran into a deadline and just didn't have a good enough idea.

Luckily, the look of the film makes up for a lot of things, because this is one gorgeous movie. While Don Bluth gets a lot of credit for the animation of his human characters, I have always been more attracted to his nonhumans, and ""Titan A.E."" offers a great mix of both. Even when it comes to his aliens, the approach is always semi-realistic, so the characters are rarely rubbery or outside of the regular laws of motion. The inclusion of a ton of CG imagery might be distracting to some people but I love it: it gives the film a unique techno-style appearance, and whereas the ample computer graphics dated Bluth's ""Anastasia"" within a couple years after its release, ""Titan A.E."" still looks fairly strong today, particularly in cases where character models are a mix of hand-drawn and computer-made graphics.

The fact that Bluth and Goldman haven't directed a mainstream feature film in over fourteen years might be a testament to the devaluation of 2D animation in the American market, though it's also somewhat comforting that they haven't gone the direct-to-video route in lieu of offers from large studios. Even if these guys never put out another movie in their lives, this one is an accomplishment to be proud of and a film to be watched more than once. Recommended!",1415145600,,5676,6.633916554508748

What is funny about that is that these would be the same folks that ridicule creation as they love the idea of mankind creating a new world without evolution.  Not that I am convinced that God did not engineer in the abilities for His creatures to evolve ...That would make great sense if in the beginning there was one location that spread out over the world able to adapt as engineered to.  Anyway my advice is not to spend any money on this one because besides the godless part even, there just is not much in this cartoon to impress unless you are just super easy to entertain and don't expect much for your money (a polite way to say it) Young ones will be bored to tears as well ...slow witted adolescent early teen types devoid of truth might enjoy it I guess.",1382400000,,1091,4.354679802955665

Plot:
The plot is an excellent piece of sci-fi and takes place in a classic post-apocalyptic time when Earth is destroyed by aliens (thus the name, Titan A.E. [After Earth]).

Visuals:
The visuals are great. It isn't just a pure CGI film like Pixar or Dreamworks films. Instead it fuses hand-drawn art and CGI. This actually makes for a really cool look. There are shots of space that are worthy of being desktop backgrounds yet the characters are still cartoony.

1284823,2,B00003CXDR,"So here is my take on Titan A.E. for whatever it may be worth. Cult-status aside, it is just not that great overall. (The key word being *overall*) I love sci-fi, I very much appreciate the art of animation, and I wanted to love this film. However, both when I originally saw it in the theater, and when I recently re-watched it a decade+ later, I was disappointed with the end product. Yes, there are some great visuals, and I enjoy it for that. The space refugee colony, the birdlike aliens, the ice, all very cool. The thing is that the story, characters, soundtrack and editing just do not all add up to do justice to the main concept of the Titan, which in itself, had potential. Many films do a great job of reusing familiar plot elements, but in this one, it often comes across as being very cliched and/or outright plagiaristic of Star Wars, Independence Day, etc. The characters, other than maybe the lead, feel pretty flat and underdeveloped. Also, this may be a quibble, but the hairstyle of the main character was kind of awkwardly dated when this originally came out. (Seriously, that really did bother me.) What else was/is dated was the soundtrack. Titan A.E. was released at the end of the 90s, but music felt more like it came out of the 80s. I am not sure who thought that that was a good idea, but it was not a smart move in the interest of courting a large mainstream audience. And finally, some of the plot twists are just painfully cliched, which hurts the characters that they involve. I do not mean to be overly negative, but there is a tendency nowadays to gushingly praise this film, and while I do like watching it, and sincerely wish that it had been successful enough to lead to more like it (sci-fi animation), I do not think that it delivers on its potential. And a pity, that. (I do like Janeane Garofalo's character.)",1340323200,2,1850,4.492581602373887
1284913,5,B00003CXDR,"I First saw Titan AE Long After It's Theatrical Release, Somewhere around 2008 on DIRECTV. I've been looking for it @ BestBuy & Wal*mart & I never found it. I was shocked @ how good it was. Unlike Others I Love Star Wars 1, 2 & 3. I knew what to expect, G.L. locked himself into who Darth Vader was. But not how he was turned to the Dark Side. That was what we wanted to see, Gorge should have looked forward instead of Back. It was the forward look of Titan AE that made it a Movie a Ton of people missed due to poor reviews that never gave it a fair chance. But like the movie even it's dated hand drawing & CGI aged well. Aided like all Animated movies made years ago by today's technology makes the older movies look better, almost like newer Animated Movies. The move has a vision of mankind's future that has rarely been looked at most movies show an apocalyptic future or turning us all into an Asian Society or Slaves To Aliens. The movies view is one that show the rush to get away before they are wiped out by Aliens & then the hardships of humans and finally a bright ending and the start of a very good future. The sound track matches the action tho I like movie music to be from an Orchestra. I don't like rap, rap always over powers the action that it's playing to. But Orchestra music fallows the flow of a movie better and doesn't over power a movie. It complaments the movie and Helps to bring you deeper into the movie. The colors are deep and rich and the mouth movements match the words. Now if i could find out what the Special Edition has different in it. Also is Titan AE & or the Titan AE Special Edition or Both available on BLU-ray? If anyone knows please let me know here in this scetion Please? Thank You.",1335744000,,1733,4.176119402985075

1284916,1,B00003CXDR,"WARNING WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS! Back in 2000 we rented this movie and I remember watching it with my mom and 2 year old brother and I really hated it.  After we finished watching it I was so happy that I didn't go to the theaters to see it. Years later when I saw bits of it again on t.v. I realized exactly WHY I hated. If you must see it I wouldn't even rent it just wait til HBO shows it again. Which I doubt it will be for a while. The overall plot is earth gets destroyed by the evil dredj aliens and this main brat Kale is bitter over his dad's death. And then he meets a girl they can't stand each other then they have hots for each other. And then they try to find a machine that will recreate earth. And Kales dad made the machine before he died. There are so many things that made this movie stupid.

1. How did the main guy know what the alien lord was saying did he take the dredj language in school as a second langauage?

2. Why do the dredj hate us so much? They just said they don't like what we may become. Well are we going to become smarter, evil what? ITS NEVER EXPLAINED! They want to destroy the Titan because it will recreate earth. That part I understand

3. We find out Korso the guy who raised Kale after Kales daddy dies was working with the dredj and then gets annoyed that they both were listening. Dude next time if you don't want anyone to hear you close the door! Its all your fault to begin with don't be mad that they heard you be mad at yourself! And you shouldn't have betrayed them anyway.

4. Korso who was ratting the hero out to the dredj. I mean first hes a good guy, then turns into a bad guy and a traiter and then he turns back into a good guy sacrificing himself to help the hero saying no its better this way. Apperntly the bad guy doesn't know what side hes on.

5. The main guy and main girl hate each other at first but then have the hots for each other as the movie goes on. Can't we have girls not fall in love with guys who are obnoxous? I understand he may be hot and a hero and he lost his dad years ago but COME ON!

6. It just wasn't a kids movie. Its more for the teenage and adult men. And when it says Star Wars fans would like it THEY LIED! I love the original Star Wars movies but I hated this movie.

7. In the end after the drejd are defeated, Kale and the girl end up together and in the end Kale names the new earth after his dead father Planet Bob!

1285031,5,B00003CXDR,"Titan AE is a moving story that incorporates some really interesting visuals with hybrid cartoon/CGI animations. There really aren't very many movies out there that are as epic and as family friendly as Titan AE. Usually when you have scifi movies about the survival of humankind, they tend to be dark and violent. While Titan AE definitely has its darker moments, the film will leave you feeling satisfied and happy. Also, there is only mild violence. There is a little cartoon blood in a couple scenes, but its really not bad at all. Titan AE also has really good characterization; you will really care for the main characters by the end of the movie.

In terms of visuals, there is some really well done blending of cartoon and CGI. For example, in one scene, Cale is cutting an old derelict starship with some kind of futuristic saw in space. His face and body are drawn, but CGI is used to create a vivid star field reflection on his space helmet, which looks really cool. Later on in the film, there is a chase involving asteroids made of ice, in which CGI is used heavily and it looks spectacular.

Overall, Titan AE is a really unique movie and I'm sad it is often underrated and didn't do very well in the box office. It is a visual treat and has a truly moving story. I've been thinking about the film a lot lately and I've seen it several times again for fun.

1285032,3,B00003CXDR,This film was a financial flop at the box office and probably because it was sold as an adult film and then a film for children.

But wait there's these energy dudes who hate humans and what they might become so look out.  Animation is done classically but some of the dialogue is below par.  Interesting range of animal alien characters and the special effects are noticeably good. STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; SPECIAL EFFECTS: B minus to B (but probably higher for its time); OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: early August 2011 (streamed).,1313452800,,861,4.571428571428571
1285033,1,B00003CXDR,"The supposed plot: Earth has been invaded and destroyed. The main characters father foresaw this and set up a large ship equipped with everything to start a new one populated by all the plants and the animals (Etc) on the first. Naturally there is some opposition to this plan primarily from  an alein race called the Drej. That's the plot in a nutshell.

Lot of potential right?

The conflict always starts with betrayal. ALWAYS.  Everybody betrays everybody else.  Seriously. after the second betrayal I was alright, I figured that everyone  with the group of heroes was loyal and that they weeded out all the rats but NO The cycle of betrayal continues until only the main Character and his love intrest are left. I understand that this element is put into films to evoke surprise when a good guy suddenly goes bad but when someone betrays the group every ten minutes  It makes the plot even more idiotic an predictable. I honestly wondered if someone with a severe mental defect wrote the script.

The animation is unimaginative.  You've got your typical  blond-haired  overly muscular troublemaker with a cliche past,
A cynical heroine, An ugly looking sophisticated alien and of course someone who assumes the role of the father the protagonist never had for very long. Pfft. The Drej look awesome but despite glowing there really isn't much to them. They don't even have an intelligible language just audible gurgling noises with subtitles. That's one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen.

The heroes succeed and the protagonist decides to name the planet Bob after his father.  He (of course) gets the girl and the movie ends.

It's a pathetic poor excuse for  a movie, plot, and script  that depends on the same plot devcice for progression.

1285037,3,B00003CXDR,"Titan A.E. had everything going for it. It was written by Joss Whedon, the guy who gave us Firefly and Serenity. It was directed by Don Bluth, who gave us The Secret of NIMH. With talent like that, it should have been an excellent animated sci-fi film. Instead, it isn't.

The story starts off with an alien race called the Drej blowing up the Earth. Before that happens, though, a young boy named Cale is given a ring by his father, who was working on something called the Titan Project. Fast forward fifteen years, and Cale, now an obnoxious young man, is recruited by Corso, captain of the Valkyrie and its ragtag crew: It turns out that Cale's ring is actually a map to the Titan, which is humanity's last hope. Of course, the second Cale finds this out, the Drej attack--they're looking for the Titan too--and the Valkyrie's crew have to race to find it before the Drej do. Along the way Cale has the obligatory romance with the only human girl on the crew, and tangles with the obligatory double-crossing crew member.

It's not all these clichs that make this a bad movie. It's the inconsistencies. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. Lots of people get shot, and there is a rather large amount of blood, which makes it feel like a mature sci-fi film. But then there's the cringe-inducing, funny-talking alien-toad character who likes to say ""Who's your daddy!?!""

The animation is also inconsistent and sometimes just hard to watch. The hand-drawn stuff is beautiful, but the movie also relies on a lot of CG work. It looks good in places, but when it doesn't it completely throws you out of the movie. The CG-animated Drej, for instance, never really mesh with the hand-drawn characters, which is unfortunate, because they're the villains and so tend to show up quite a lot. Some of the CG backgrounds look as if they aren't even fully rendered, which is odd, since Tarzan had come out a year before, and that movie used CG backgrounds very convincingly. There are even spots where the CG looks like it's running on 12 frames per second.

There are also quite a number of plot holes as well. Cale defeats the Drej, but there's nothing to stop other Drej from coming to blow up Cale's new home, is there? The Drej, conveniently, will try to kill another character by locking her in a box with a nicely ample air supply. Cale, unaccountably, has magic fingertips that let him slip through a force field. The film's astrophysics are also quirky: it shows a planet forming and quickly acquiring a habitable surface, though a little reflection (and scientific knowledge) suggest its surface should be molten for a very long time. Singly, none of these logical lapses should cripple the movie. Collectively, they undermine its believability.

The Titan A.E. Special Edition is more or less your average DVD. The picture quality is great and comes, surprisingly, in CinemaScope. (Most animated films are 1.85:1 widescreen.) The commentary is enjoyable, though it mostly consists of Bluth pointing out the movie's flaws and wishing he'd had more money and time to work on it. There's a decent, kid-friendly run-of-the-mill behind-the-scenes featurette. It also has a music video, stills gallery, some pointless deleted scenes, and some trailers. Like I said, it's an average DVD.

I don't understand. Titan A.E. had such potential. Sure, Bluth had made some bad films before this one, but we all knew that if he wanted to make a more mature film he could pull it off, like he did with NIMH. Whedon can do science fiction and was actually a writer on the first Toy Story, so he had prior experience with animation.

Titan A.E. deserves respect for being an original and gutsy gamble, and we're worse off for the fact that it bombed as it led to Fox to closing its hand drawn animation studio. But it says nothing good that the best thing about it is that it's not another Ice Age sequel.",1287273600,,3895,4.71071953010279

Bluth and company used multiple animation techniques to film this story.  These differnet animation styles are evident when you see the film.  One style is traditional 2D animation, and is used in this film for the characters and their interactions with each other.  The other method uses a computer animated 3D rendering method, and is used for large scale shots of space and space ships, etc.  While Bluth does both methods well, they seem to me to clash with each other as you jump from one style to the other.  Even so, this is still a noteable film for 2000, even though by this time Pixar had run away with a new approach to feature length animation techniques (starting with Toy Story, in 1995).

One of the things that Bluth did that was, in 2000, something fairly new for feature length animation was to choose not to make this story a musical, but he employed a soudtrack of rock music to build on the space theme (similar to what was done for the Disney film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Treasure-Planet/dp/B00005JLR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Treasure Planet</a>&nbsp;in 2002).  Titan A.E.'s soundtrack hits early and obviously in the first scenes of the movie and reappears in several later scenes, though it is mainly background music for most of the show.

Even though the animation now appears somewhat dated, this is still a fun film that is worth watching.  All in all this is a solid film worth 4 stars.

The soundtrack accounts for about 75  percent of what I love and then there's the voices.  That Barrymore voice is so wonderful to listen to (especially without the distraction of some of the ridiculously facial expressions that are a part of her regular acting, sorry Drew!) and the other voices are wonderful and the colors are magnificent. There is a scene on a red planet with the blue antagonists that is just eye popping. The story is actually an epic tale played out so even the very young can enjoy it. There is no manipulation of the heart strings as is so common in disney movies and so tedious for parents. The worst thing that happens is a bad guy insect gets zapped by the really bad guy droids.  I tell the kids he's an alien bug and who knows what his life cycle is?  Actually the worst thing that happens is the destruction of the planet earth but that is in the first 3 minutes or so and every character the story introduces up to that point flees on escape pods.

1285124,3,B00003CXDR,"Titan A. E. (Don Bluth, 2000)

I came to Titan A.E., a film I had wanted to see in the cinema and them forgotten about (it seems many did), in the same way I came to Heaven's Gate. You may find that an odd comparison, but on one huge level it works: both were films that were said to bring about the destruction of the companies that bankrolled them (United Artists and Fox Animation, respectively). Both of those charges were gross exaggerations. And, when you get finished watching them, both films are far better than the critics who savaged them when they appeared made out. Titan A.E. is not as great a film as Heaven's Gate, but it's certainly not an awful one.

The situation is this: Cale Tucker (Matt Damon), a roustabout/castaway in space, who works for whoever will hire him doing whatever they want him to do, is approached by a pair of military types, Joseph Korso (Bill Pullman) and his sidekick Akima (Drew Barrymore). Cale is the son of Sam Tucker (Ron Perlman), who devised a very cool spaceship called Titan just before a nasty race called the Drej, being of pure energy, destroyed the entire planet. (Shades of Hitchhiker's Guide, but without the interstellar highway and the awful poetry.) Korso is convinced that Cale is the key to finding the Titan, which went missing with its crew--including Sam--just after earth's destruction. Sam is initially resistant, but once he sees that Korso's actually onto something (a ring given Cale by his father contains a map), Sam signs on with Korso's ragtag band of space misfits, who include such real-life misfits as John Leguizamo, Nathan Lane, and Janeane Garofalo.

It's space opera, and it's pretty standard space opera at that, but this is a kind of animation one rarely sees anymore; that alone should be enough to get you interested. More to the point, while there's an obvious kids' market for the flick--comparisons to The Last Starfighter are often, and warranted--it's also very adult, in some ways. Not Ralph Bakshi American Pop adult (and it must here be stated that someone outside Japan needs to start making animated films for adults again), but mature enough to keep the parents as interested as the kids. I grant you that space opera is going to play to a vertical market, far more so than Disney's castrated fairytale retellings, but that didn't stop The Iron Giant from taking in a decent amount at the box office. It's not a bad little movie, as movies go. Certainly not the kind of thing that brings down a studio (blame the marketing department for getting the promo posters out so early that folks like me had time to forget the thing was coming), and a movie that deserves to be rediscovered ten years later. ***",1264550400,,2699,4.726114649681529

1285242,4,B00003CXDR,"I haven't watched this film in a very long time, but I remember it very well. What caught my attention was the animation and the music (the songs ""Cosmic Castaway"" and ""It's My Turn to Fly"" became instant favorites back in the days). This is a very distinctive film in that it has an unusual adult plot and heavy violence. It's almost as mature as the ""Night on Bald Mountain"" sequence in Disney's Fantasia.

I'll go on with the cons first. A few characters are targeted at a much younger audience, and their presence on screen is at times quite annoying. The script, although not that bad, needed some improvements at some spots; a bit juvenile here and there. Some of the animation is a bit in-your-face: it felt like the animators wanted to ""show off"" with their creation. And finally, it's confusing whether or not this is aimed at an older or younger audience. There's a mix of childish and mature moments throughout the film. It got quite annoying until the climax of the film.

But flaws are few, and the good outweighs the bad. Despite being in-your-face, the animation is one of the finest that I've ever seen. The details and 3-dimensional appearances makes me wish that there were more animated fillms that looked like this. Voice work is surprisingly satisfactory (Pullman and Lane really pull it off), and the realistic sound effects are to die for.

I had mixed feelings about this movie, and I didn't mind it being a failure at the box office. But now, I can see that it was a daring move from FOX, and I see that it works on many (but not all) levels. It's a very good film, period.

Grade: B+",1233014400,,1609,4.518900343642612
1285243,5,B00003CXDR,"I have long been a fan of the work Don Bluth and Gary Goldman.  For those of you that have never heard of them, they are two film directors/producers, who have produced classic animated films, such as The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go To Heaven, and Anastasia.  Bluth has been considered one of the premier animators of his time, dating back to his days with Disney, where he worked on The Fox and The Hound, Robin Hood, The Rescuers, and Pete's Dragon.  His use of the traditional hand-drawn method of animation was almost unrivaled in my opinion, and even when he chose to adhere to more modern conventional methods, he excelled.  One film where he used newer technology, combining his preferred hand drawing methods with CGI, was Titan A.E, released in the summer of 2000.

In review, I would say that the film was a complete success.  It was kind of a cross between Water World and Star Wars.  The film took place more than a thousand years into the future, a time when the human race was on the verge extinction.  The protagonist of the film, Cale, voiced by Matt Damon, is the son of a scientist who built a craft that could potentially save mankind from the forces that are attempting to extinguish it.  A group of both aliens and humans whose mission is to revitalize mankind approach Cale.  This group is led by the manly, Han Solo type, Korso, who is voiced by Bill Pullman.  Cale is unbelieving of this, and it takes the revelation that there is a map on his hand to convince him to join in on the adventure.

The film combines all of the elements that you could ask for in an action movie.  The animation is superb; Bluth really outdid himself in this one.  The scenes with the Ice Rings are pure evidence of why animation is superior to live action is some types of film.  In addition, the action sequences are suspenseful and thrilling.  The alien race, the Drej, are invincible and consist of pure energy, so they make for a good battle scene.  The plot is executed very well, with plenty of foreshadowing, mystery, and tragedy.  Of course, there is a romance within the story, as well.  Matt Damon's character falls for Akima, who is voiced by none other than Drew Barrymore.  Their affections for each other throughout the film, and it is done in a very cute and flirtatious way.  All in all, the movie hit all of its spots, and the voice acting was great, headlined by Damon and Pullman.

Yet despite the high quality of the movie and its immense budget, it failed to garner much attention at the box office.  Internationally, it took in under 40 million dollars even though it had a budget of 75 million.  I have always been perplexed as to why this was the case, but it has come into the light after a few years of thought.  It was a very well-received film, with Ebert giving it a positive review.  But then I think back, and I realize that I did not even go and see it in theaters.  I'd say that one reason its commercial success was so underwhelming was because it failed to target the demographic that wanted to see it.  Looking back, the marketing team for the film strictly sold the film as a hardcore action movie.  By doing this, they lost the core younger audience, who had always adored Bluth films.  It lost the kids who grew up watching A Troll In Central Park or An American Tail.  All of the kids who loved Fifel did not think that this was a movie for them, so they never begged mommy and daddy to bring them to the movies.  The marketers instead targeted a group of teenage boys, firmly believing that they could sell an animated action movie to a group of kids who care more about their reputations than anyone else on this planet.  In doing this, Titan A.E. failed to incorporate that this quality film, possibly Bluth's magnum opus, had aspects of mystery, romance, fantasy, and even nostalgia within its plot.  Instead of marketing this as family film along the lines of an Anastasia or an Aladdin, they tried to turn this movie into something it wasn't.  This does not in any way lessen the quality of the film, but it does explain why it failed to be the hit it should have been.  In the years since its release, Titan A.E. has become a cult classic, and it is constantly on television, and you can even watch it online on sites like Hulu.  In the end, this movie may have been the commercial failure that prevents Bluth from ever producing again, yet it remains a classic.  Bluth is getting up there in age now; some production company needs to bring Bluth and his team aboard and let them work their magic.  Otherwise, we may never get to have another experience like the first time we saw The Land Before Time ever again.",1225670400,3,4704,4.457309941520468

1285246,4,B00003CXDR,"Titan A.E. has an interesting premise of a post-apocalyptic scenario for humankind in space.  With a grunge/punk soundtrack, this appeals to a more modern generation than some other animated space films.  I would say this fits in the same genre as Disney's animated Treasure Island (the one set in space).  It's clean enough for small kids, and still entertaining for teens or adults, if predictable.  I was really impressed by the seamless integration of both 3d generated graphics and traditional 2d animation.  The plot is easy to follow, the characters realistic and engaging.  I also liked that the aliens are more interesting than humans with extra features.  I didn't like the hive mind villain idea, but that doesn't make the villain any less scary for younger viewers.

1285315,2,B00003CXDR,"Coulda waited another 8.  No wonder this movie sank Fox Animation studios.

This movie was so predictable.  No matter how much special f/x you throw at a movie, if the story isn't there people over 11 y.o will not pay attention to the screen for very long.  The character development was non-existent, you just KNEW someone was tipping the Drej; and since the movie cam never leaves the main characters, you knew it was one of the crew.  This is ironic since all the time spent listening to the ham-flled script could have provided an opportunity for the audience to connect to the characters.

Biggest example of predictable: bad guy man (redeems himself at the end to work the Titan, THERE'S a surprise) remarks how the Drej are unstoppable because they are pure energy, just 2 minutes after the hologram message left for Cale states the Titan's energy cells are depleted.  Well guess what the Titan uses to power the Genesis project (er, I mean the Titan)?  The traitor/protagonist at the end redeeming himself is SO Joss Whedon, as this is how Spike dies at the end of Buffy and Angelis at the end of Angel.

Plot holes?  If the human race is so dangerous, why didn't the Drej pick them off after blowing up the planet?  Where did the rest of humanity wind up? Humanity was smart enough to create a Genesis project, but all that tech blows up with the creation of a new planet.  How hard could it have been to create a separate piece of storage media to hold humanity's science, art, literature, et al?  Couldn't be on the Titan, it blew up.

Then there's the rock soundtrack that is put in place of a typical orchestra to build suspense and carry the emotion of the movie.  Sorry, but there is only one HEAVY METAL movie, and this is a sorry attempt at recreating that cult-ish movie follwing that still gets the it watched nearly 30 years later.

Movies like Pulp Fiction, Blair Witch project, and Swingers all prove you don't need A list celebs, big budgets, and hammy, WAY over the top scriptwriting to sell a movie.

1285317,3,B00003CXDR,"Titan A.E is a world so imaginative and vast that it would have been better suited for a 3 hour epic, a mini-series, or a TV show.

This film is not bad, in fact, it is quite good, but a lot of the 90 minute running time is gun fighting action, and the plot, while still interesting, feels vastly underdeveloped. Certain segments of the movie that could have been fleshed out for hours with interesting ideas were cut to just minutes. One such scene is when the central cast arrives at a human drifter colony. This scene in the movie lasts all of 5 minutes, and shows us almost nothing about the world of the last human society. There was so much potential here, but in 90 minutes, it could never be explored. A second scene is a rescue in a trade platform where slaves and all kinds of other merchanidise are bartered. This scene lasts 5 minutes at best but could have gone on easily for an hour. Nothing is fleshed out about the slave trade, or for that matter, any of the dozens of wonderfully drawn species of alien that roam this platform.

Titan A.E is a wonderfully concieved universe that has a vast potential for storytelling. 90 Minutes of running time, especially when much of it is action, does not begin to do this world justice. The film is good however, and I really enjoyed watching it. Especially given the rock bottom price here, you should pick it up. It's not a waste of money.",1213142400,3,1397,4.410852713178294

1285423,4,B00003CXDR,"Titan A.E is an under-rated animated science fiction film that barely anyone seen when it was in theatres. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within had a similar treatment when it was in theatres. I guess because most grown-ups don't go to theatres to see films like this. Plus with the rock music and style of the film it does sorta target teenagers and they were probably too busy seeing X-Men or Mission Impossible 2 at the time. But that's a shame because this is a lot less of a disapointing Science Fiction film than StarWars Episode 1 which was released a year before it. Infact minus the rock music this is more like any of the original Starwars films than any of the prequels.

  It's about a group of human rebels who set out to find something called the Titan that might actually be able to build a planet. Since humans have no real home any more after earth was destroyed. They battle an alien race that destroyed earch called the Drej. The Drej are desperate to stop them from finding the Titan.

  It's not the greatest cartoon movie ever made but it's refreshing compared to anything else that gets released these days. I mean lets face it everyone just wants to see 3-D these days and no one rushes to see the traditional regular animated movie any more these days. Although this film does have an unique look to it. It also has the sort of style of the animated Transformers movie from the 80's. So fans of that might appreciate this at least. It's also really better than most summer movies that people actually rush out to see. Plus the voice acting is fine. You have Matt Damon, Drew Barrymoore, Bill Pullman, John Leguzamo, Nathan Lane and Janeane Garofalo. Out of all of them I think the under-rated and under-used Bill Pullman does the best work here. He voices a Han Solo type character and does a really good job stealing the show.

Unfortunately the movie suffers from what many movies, especially in this genre, suffer from.  They don't commit to an adult or child-based audience, nor do they go after strictly a scifi audience or a more general viewing audience.  So what ends up happening is you get just enough of both, without fully focusing on one target audience, a little sterile, but still good.

With talents like the legendary Don Bluth on animation, skilled sci-fi screenwriters like Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Ben Edlund (The Tick) writing the screenplay and stars like Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman and Nathan Lane doing voice over work and a [...]dollar budget the movie had all the elements of a hit. Unfortunately all these talented individuals failed to become successful when brought together on this project. Titan A.E. is an uninspired mess of a movie with a predictable story, dated looking animation, flat acting and primitive looking CGI. Thanks in part to the box office failure of this movie and several others like Treasure Planet and Atlantis, hand drawn animated movies are currently not being produced by American movie studios. A shame because there are so many great stories to tell using this art form.

Titan A.E. follows the story of Cale, a young boy in the year 3028 or something. Cale's father has built a spaceship The Titan, which can recreate an Earth like planet when activated. Big blue off the shelf computer generated aliens known as The Drej find out about the Titan and go to Earth to destroy it. During a final onslaught on the planet, Cale's father gives his son to an alien to care for along with a ring then gets on another ship. The Titan escapes along with a few million human survivors. Five-year-old Cale helplessly watches as the Drej blow up Earth and kill his father. So bleak, so boring so predictable.

Cut to fifteen years later. Cale a young man now, is working a crummy job at a space station. True to formula, he's angry and disillusioned drifting through life with no direction. After an unappetizing lunch of living creatures, Cale runs afoul of some human hating aliens. He's about to get pummeled when he conveniently he runs into Korso, a man who says he's been searching the galaxy for fifteen years for him on his quest to find the Titan. He activates a code in Cale's ring and conveniently the Drej head to the station to kill him. It would have been helpful to give the bad guys some character development here. I find it odd how the Drej found Cale at the same time as Korso but not for the past fifteen years despite being smart enough to blow up a planet. Cale and Korso shoot it out with the Drej to escape the space station, but the bug like cook who served lunch is a casualty of the assault. They hotwire a spaceship which gets damaged as it leaves the station and make a thrilling jump into space without spacesuits. Too bad this makes no sense scientifically. Their bodies would have exploded from the pressure before they asphyxiated.

The movie goes on in spite of this minor plothole. On board Korso's ship Cale meets the attractive Akima, who looks both hot and edgy along with other members of Korso's alien crew. The quest for the Titan begins and the slowly paced movie starts to get even slooower, changing into a ninety minute long chase where we watch Cale and Akima start a lukewarm romance, shooting, arguing between Cale and the crew, arguing between Cale and Akima, arguing between Cale and Korso, two brief scenes where nudity is teased, and just more arguing and shooting leading to Predictable plot twist #1: Korso is working for the Drej and plans on destroying the Titan when they find it. True to formula, Korso gets a change of heart and sacrifices himself and Cale activates the Titan after learning predictable plot twist #2: Drej are beings of pure energy and they would power the Titan when it recreates the Earth like planet. Cale figures this out in record time and recreates the planet calling it ""Bob"". The movie ends and I shed a tear as I watch an opportunity to make something truly innovative in the Science Fiction genre wasted by a bunch of people who have the talent to do much better.
Titan A.E. fails as a science fiction movie because of a poorly written script that has the plot and character development of a bad 1980's Saturday morning cartoon. Edlund and Whedon's weak screenplay plays everything safe and takes no risks in telling Cale's story. Movies in the Science Fiction genre always take risks exploring the worlds they inhabit and exploring the personalities of the characters who live in the universe. There was a story to tell here, but the writers focused on the wrong characters and the wrong plot points. The real story should have been with Cale's father not Cale. I wanted to know why he made the Titan and why was there a need to create a new Earth like planet. Could Earth have been overpopulated and scientists felt they needed a new world was the solution to handle the masses? Did the energy based Drej fear Earthmen exploiting their race as power source for the Titan? Perhaps Drej spies read about slavery in ancient American history texts and colonization of foreign lands during the colonial period and felt the need for a pre-emptive strike. These were deeper reasons for an intergalactic planet destroying war and should have been the focus of the movie's overall plot.
Production wise, Titan A.E. is subpar. Bluth's hand-drawn animation for Fox looks horribly outdated when put side to side with the work of other animators at the competing animated studios of Disney, DreamWorks and Warner Brothers in the same year. Bluth's backgrounds are often too dark and character movements over exaggerated. Bluth, true to his style over the past thirty years focuses too much on wide shots of flailing of limbs to express character emotion and not on close-ups of facial expressions to tell his story. Watch any of Bluth's Disney films (Robin Hood, The Fox and the Hound) or his 90's Fox films (Anastasia, The Land Before Time, An American Tail) to see how little his style has changed with the times. The CGI has no detail and doesn't blend into the backgrounds smoothly. The Drej and their ships look like they belong in another film not here in Titan A.E. Compare the animation in Titan A.E. to DreamWorks' Road to El Dorado released that same year. Road does everything Titan A.E wanted to do from a technical standpoint blending CGI and animation beautifully. Brad Birds' work on Warner's Iron Giant features a well-written story and is a brighter film with lively human characters and beautiful backgrounds. Disney's later efforts like Kim Possible and Lilo and Stitch have more engaging characters and utilize unique animated character designs. Titan A.E. with its looks and feels like a 1980's movie not a 2000 theatrical release.

Fox was setting up Titan A.E. to be a sci-fi classic that pushed the genre of hand-drawn animated films into the adult themed direction of Japanese Manga. Ironically, the failure of these ""riskier"" hand-drawn animated movies like Fox's Titan, A.E., DreamWorks Road to El Dorado, Warner's The Iron Giant, Disney's Treasure Planet and Atlantis halted the production of hand-drawn animated films in America for the time being. Because American studios and audiences continue to see hand-drawn animated films as children's fare filmmakers cannot push the envelope and tell the adult themed stories of their Japanese counterparts. Until American movie studios and audiences change their perceptions about hand-drawn animation, filmmakers will never be able to make hand-drawn animated movies with mature themes and expand the audience for the art form past small children.
Pass this one by at the video store. Adults looking for an adult themed animated movie should Pick up the far superior Heavy Metal or Castle of Cogliostro and preteens looking for a non-Disney animated film can pick up the superior Road to El Dorado, The Iron Giant or The Prince of Egypt.",1157932800,6,7736,4.836226415094339

We got geek stereotypes, smiling villain stereotypes, latent nobility stereotypes, good female lead with great hips stereotype, and everything else needed for a cool flick.

The animation style is self-consciously computer-y for the bad guys. They're very polygonal, as if they weren't worth a few splines. The good guys all look like cel animation, like those great 1930s movies from Disney. And there's everything in between. I mean this in the best way - all that computer animation is good, and the cel-like animation is good. Connected? well, not a lot.

1285521,5,B00003CXDR,"I don't care what anyone says, this is one of my all-time favorite films.  The front-cover of the DVD I've owned since Christmas 2000, shortly after it was first released, boasts the Hollywood Bytes review of ""This is the movie 'Star Wars' fans have been waiting for.""  The fact is, even though my tastes, especially due to 'Star Wars,' have greatly expanded and matured since first viewing this film, I have to agree with the critic.  The fact is, I think the only reason this film didn't do well was due to the fact that most people assumed it was another kiddie-film since it was animated, and too many were looking far more forward to X-Men: The Movie being released just a month later (I being one of them, although I saw both of these opening-day in theatres), along with other Summer 2000 blockbusters.  I have never stopped loving this film and am proud to have one of the first copies from when it was released.  Yes, I've seen that people complain of rather 'blatantly obvious' songs on the soundtrack that tied in far too well with the scene taking place during their usage, yada-yada-yada.  The fact remains, this is an ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS film.  The music, despite certain 'corny-ness'fits the film well - any of the especially cheesy songs are saved for the credits, so you don't even have to listen to some of them if you don't want, so stop complaining.

As a sci-fi fan, this movie has it all - a little slip of romance between Matt Damon's 'Cale' and Drew Barrymore's 'Akima,' almost non-stop action with perfectly, well-timed breaks here and there that is accented beautifully by the amazing special effects teams on this film.  It's absolutely heart-breaking that there aren't more perfectly mated 2D/3D animated films like this made anymore...Princess Mononoke from Studio Ghibli is one of a precious few I can think of that where two-dimensional characters and three-dimensional backgrounds have been blended so seemlessly that one forgets what they're watching until a a scene that is clearly one or the other.  It's such a shame that Fox Animation studios is no longer around (to my knowledge), which I recall hearing was due to the failure that was the Columbia Pictures co-production of 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within,' a strikingly beautiful film despite his weak plot and disbelievable characters.  But I digress, I'm supposed to prattle on about 'Titan A.E.' not Fox's unfortunate loss.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that this is the end of an amazing yet incredibly short run of a lost artform.  Everything's gone completely computer-generated now that one has to seek out Anime to find any beautifully-crafted hand-drawn animation anymore.  Again, yes, 'Titan' has lots of the special effects and 3D animation 'Star Wars' and Sci-Fi fans such as myself have grown accustomed to in our favorite cinema, but I can't tell you how sick it makes me to be watching what's majorily a live-action piece with such poorly-done 3D CG effects.  The key with 'Titan' is that because you were working with 2D hand-drawn figures, the almost cartoon-y-ness of the CG FIT, and it fit ASTONISHINGLY WELL.  I've seen enough films such as 'Star Wars' (I apologize to my fellow Jedi/Sith friends, but it's true and you know it), where it (the prequels especially, save Revenge, which only has crap lines for the normally amazing Natalie Portman, sadly) almost seem to be nothing but effects and low on story, especially poorly-acted (*cough*Jake Lloyd*cough*) roles.  But 'Titan' delivers a very well-written script that does its job of grabbing your attention and still not letting go even after the finale (I was really bummed we didn't even get to see 'Cale' & 'Akima' kiss, even after we see the brief nudity of his rear, you'd think they'd show a measly kiss).  I was just watching it again tonight, and only now was I understanding a bit more of the scientific theories and mythologies that the screenwriters (including the amazing Joss Whedon from 'Buffy' fame) have plugged in (see?  Even seeing it for the like the thousandth time still reveals fresh ideas!).  I have NEVER been bored with this film in the five years it's been out, and I doubt I will be in the fifteen years after eart- I mean, after the film's release *wink*.",1118448000,,4262,4.836313617606603
1285522,2,B00003CXDR,"Judging from the nearly empty theater in which I saw 'Titan A.E.' on opening weekend, I am not alone in my opinion.

'Titan A.E.' is a mess. It is Recycled Cr*p That Should Have Never Been Made.

Don Bluth is famous more as a defector from the Disney Studio fold. He left just before Disney began producing films like 'The Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and the Beast'. In other words, he left just as they were experiencing a renaissance. He seems to be at the head of every high-profile animated effort that a competing studio has released in the last few years. Can you name any? Pretty difficult because most of the films are completely forgettable. No one is likely to go to the local video store hunting down a copy of 'All Dogs Go To Heaven' or `The Pebble and The Penguin'.

'Titan R.C.T.S.H.N.B.M' is recycled from just about every science fiction movie ever made. It even steals dialogue from the films. If you are going to steal and recycle, at least try to mix things up a bit. If you have seen 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek II', 'Star Trek: First Contact' and many other films, you will not be surprised by any element in this film.

Matt Damon provides the voice for Cale, a young human that is bitter that his father left him just as Earth was about to explode. Drew Barrymore voices Akima, the inevitable human mate for Cale. Bill Pullman, Nathan Lane, John Leguizamo and Janeane Garafolo also provide voices. Basically, Cale has a map that will lead the last few humans to a spaceship that will recreate Earth. Cale, Akima, Korso (Pullman) and his cronies have to find the spaceship while trying to elude the Drej. For some reason that is never explained, they are afraid of humans, which is why they destroyed Earth in the first place.

This film combines two very distinct styles of animation. Most of the backgrounds and the action sequences appear to be very realistic and almost 3D. It is pretty obvious that these were generated by computer. Some of these are very interesting and visually amazing. For some reason, all of the characters are drawn in a 2D style that brings memories of 'Johnny Quest' and 'Scooby Doo' to mind. The two styles don't mix and only point out how inept the animation is for most of the film.

Add to this mix a very dated soundtrack of songs that sound like they were created in the 80s by every two-bit hard rock band and you have a film that is pretty much avoidable.

There has been a lot of press in the last few years about Disney's efforts to bury animated works from other studios. They rereleased 'The Little Mermaid' to compete with 'Anastasia'. They rereleased 'Fantasia 2000' to compete with 'Titan A.E.'.

Memo to Michael Eisner: If Fox continues to put out animated works of this quality, you don't have anything to worry about. The last film Fox released was 'Anastasia' (also a Don Bluth film). It was much, much better, but it only made about half what a bad Disney film makes. Why waste all the time, energy and money. I think it is safe to say that 'Titan A.E.' will make no where near as much as 'Dinosaur'. If a true competitor comes around, embrace it. There are so few animated films that two successes can only help expand the marketplace.",1113350400,3,3204,4.540727902946274
1285523,4,B00003CXDR,"While Titan AE may not be considered the best animated film of all time it is still a thrill for anyone to watch.  It has some of the best mix of reg and computer animation o have ever seen.  Not one outways the other giving it a perfect balance.  While Titan AE didn't do to well in the theatres it is not suprising due to the fact that FOX is not known for their animation...yet.

One thing i wasn't too sure about was how they could say this was a movie for star wars fan.  I have seen all the star war films a hundred times over each and in every edition and i don't see any familiarity of it with star wars what so ever unless you look at the fact that like han and leia, Cale and Akima do not like each other a whole lot in the beginnig....but if you have watched it you know that would be stretching it just a tad bit.  Plus star wars took place a long time ago...so in the past...remember the line ""A long time ago on a galaxy far far way?"" well Titan AE takes place in the year 3028 for the most part, when last i checked, that was the future baby.  I guess what they meant by the whole statement of it being what ""star wars fans were waiting for"" was that is was basically a movie they could like that was animated....thats my standpoint anyways.

Anyways, like i said this movie takes place in the year 3028 and the A.E. in the title means, After Earth.  Why is this?  because the villian in this film, the evil alien race, the Drej (prounounced dredged) blew it up....pretty much plain and simple.  Ths apparently was due to the fact they were afraind, as Akima put it ""of what we would become"".  So as the human race dies out in outerspace on space colonies and what not, the salvation of all of them lies within the ring, yes a ring, given to Cale by his father who was the leader of the Titan Project.  i won't disclose what that is or that would give away the enitre film, but there's the plot for you.

What is great about this film are the voice actors for the characters...the folloing in it are.... Matt Damon, Bill Pulman, John Leguizamo, Nathan Lane, Janeane Garofalo, and Drew Barrymore.  All do a wonderful job and make the story line believable to all the viewers.  I alawys hate films that have voice actors that just cant act to animated films....thank the lord that this isn't one of them.

Thats pretty much all i have to say other than this is a great animated film which although rated PG it can at times be kinda violent...i have one last thing to say about fox....they don't have any problem with animating blood like Disney does....i don't recall any animated film having blood at all ececpet fo a fraction of a second....good for you fox for being different and unafraid.",1112572800,4,2706,4.2641878669275926

1285525,5,B00003CXDR,"Once again, I find myself defending the substance of a movie that everyone claims has none.

First off, let me say that this movie has a unique and complex plot. I really don't see how anyone can dislike Titan's storyline. The Titan is NOT like the Genesis device from the Wrath of Kahn (Titan builds a new planet, while Genesis provides instant terraforming of an existing world) and Cale has NOTHING in common with Luke Skywalker except blonde hair. I've seen movies that ended with the end of the world (End of Evangelion, for example), but this is the only one that begins with the end of the world and tells of what happens afterward.  Simply put, this is a movie about finding hope after everything you know has been lost. Don Bluth tells this type of story well, and though Titan is certainly no Land Before Time, it does a damn fine job of pulling its characters' heartstrings. The first few minutes after the opening credits are VERY finely crafted, and they thoroughly convince us that humanity has become much like pre-WW2 Jews - i.e., having lost their homeland, everyone else steps all over them because they know they can get away with it. From there, the story becomes a sort of scavenger hunt, driven by Cale's desire to find his father, Korso's desire to get rich, Preed's desire to evade execution by the Drej, and Akima's desire to have a home where two inches of steel aren't the only thing separating you from space. The character interactions are as detailed and three-dimensional as the CGI, thanks in no small part to the infinite brilliance of Joss Whedon. There is a constant feeling of atmosphere; a perpetual, indescribable intensity that applies to everything from the crystal blue Drej ship interiors to the dusty and broken ruins of the Gau civilization. The ever-cool Bill Pullman does a great job as the redeemable almost-villain Captain Korso, Drew Barrymore adds both sugar and spice to the role of Akima, Nathan Lane is PERFECT as Preed, and I've never met a Janine Garofalo role that I didn't like. My compliments to the casting director.

Even the jaw-dropping eye candy is nearly always only shown when the plot is moving ahead, such as the chase through the hydrogen trees that eventually just gets Cale and Akima caught by the Drej. With a steady subtle undercurrent of sexual tension and liberal amounts of comedy to fill the gaps, there is almsot never a dull moment, although there is that one useless scene with the Wake Angels. The two or three plot twists are genuinely surprising, the blend of animation and CGI is seamless, and Don Bluth once again proves that he is the GOD of all animation.

There are no plot holes. There's a reasonable explanation for everything, you just have to pay attention and sometimes use a little logic. It's not unreasonable to assume, for example, that Cale learned the Drej language. Strict adherence to science isn't always there, but in Sci-Fi, that's impossible to avoid. The only complaint that I have with Titan is the soundtrack; it's mostly full of annoyingly anti-melodic hard rock/metal, though the lyrics (if you listen to them) set the mood quite accurately. The only song that I've come to like is ""Over my Head"" by Lit.

Ignore the critics; like all of Don Bluth's work, this is easily better than most Disney or Anime movies, and stands as an example of what American animation can and should be.",1103587200,46,3391,4.740677966101695
1285526,5,B00003CXDR,"As I tend to do in reviews, I made a claim above that seems to be over the top.  However, this is one of those cases where it does ring true.  Before I get to my analysis, note that this is not a kid's movie.  In the U.S., animated movies are perceived as being mere child's entertainment (as opposed to the sentiment in Asia).  This is one of the few animated movies that breaks that mold and offers an adult plot (violence, intelligent dialogue).

First of all, notice that this movie was made way before Disney's craptacular Treasure Planet.  This was the movie that really showcased the seemless combination of computer graphics and regular animation in it's characters and environments.  The movie's visuals hold up to today's standards even, in a world where both computer and animation visuals continue to skyrocket in quality.

Many tend to take points away from this movie in the plot department and even resort to calling it cheesy.  Sure, you've seen SOME elements of the plot before, but much of it is original enough.  But more than that, the movie has a heart.  Thanks to the terrific voice-acting of Drew Barrymore, Matt Damon, and Bill Pullman in particular, the characters' feelings come across particularly well- I've seen the movie atleast 5-6 times, and the voice acting is one of the many reasons that I never tire of it.

Finally, the movie SOUNDS really good as well.  The music for each scene fits well, even if it isn't ""music of the future"".  The orchestral also adds to the majesty of some of the more contemplative scenes.

So, if you can stand animation at all and like a good futuristic story, then you owe it to yourself to buy this one.  It can be found really cheap in the bargain bin- not because it's bad, but because here in the U.S., animation simply isn't appreciated.",1099785600,7,1806,4.632075471698113

The voice acting was... bland, monotone, but steady and although it never won any awards for the voice acting, you can sit through it.

1285606,2,B00003CXDR,"TITAN A.E. was touted as (to paraphrase) ""What STAR WARS fans have been clamoring for!"" Well, that's not really the case. Granted the visuals and animation (traditional to modern cgi) were excellent, but the movie seems to be slow and meandering at times and the characters are generic and not memorable. Lead Matt Damon (voicing the character of Cale) uses the same monotone voice throughout the movie whether he's having a conversation with someone or when he is in a tense situation). The other actors/voices fare a little better. The plot and story itself is too self-conscious and unintentionally complicated bogged down by jargon and explanation of what's going on.  Remember how simple STAR WARS was but echoed tons of sophistication?  TITAN A.E. tries too hard, and gets lost in its own (space) vacuum of wanting to be a modern space opra. Overall, a very forgettable accounting write-off for 20th Century Fox who probably thought they had another STAR WARS franchise on their hands (actually they never had the franchise to begin with because they gave it all away to George Lucas when they signed the original contract when the first installment was produced).",1096329600,2,1170,5.025773195876289
1285607,5,B00003CXDR,"Titan AE bombed in the theaters, or so I heard, but that doesn't mean a movie is bad. It's no Star Trek, but it's not The House of the Dead either. Just because some would say it's not entertaining enough to make one forget the greasy armrests and sticky floors of the local cinema complex. (Granted not all movie houses are dirty and disgusting, but around my area they are...) But I'll say this, I like the film. Sure it's a bit cheesy at times, and the soundtrack doesn't make sense at times (20th Century Rock & Roll is still popular 1000 or so years later?) but quite frankly I fail to understand what is wrong with the acting, as some other reviewers have said. It's a fun movie to watch, with or without a home theater setup. The boy who becomes a jaded teen must save the human race from extinction at the hands of an alien race, yeah, that plot sounds familiar. But there's one catch, Earth has been blown to bits and there doesn't seem to be any habitable worlds for humans to settle on (I blame the Bush administration), but the movie doesn't touch on finding a new world to call home, even when humans and many alien races can live and work in the conditions in various space stations. But this kind of thinking isn't for Titan AE, and if something like that bothers you, then this movie isn't for you. Or maybe it is. It's like $5 new these days. For the price of a movie rental one gets to keep it and not worry about renting a scratched up disc. What do ya have to lose?",1093478400,,1485,4.250883392226148

First the hard rock video-like segments are embarassing to listen to.  Not to mention pointless to the plot.
Second, a sense of time is very much missing here; the entire plotline seems to take only day or two at most, but then there it seems like those would be an exceedingly busy couple of days.  Personally, a comment or two along the lines of ""Why did it take you a whole week to track me down and free me from these slave traders?"" would have given me a better sense of pacing.

1285610,4,B00003CXDR,"Synopsis:
In the 31st century, humankind has reached a pinnacle of knowledge, but a vicious energy-based race known as the Drej find the creativity of humans to be a threat to their existence. To stop it, they destroy Earth, sending the few human refugees that escape to scatter across the galaxy with little hope left for the future of humanity.
Twenty years later, a young man named Cale (voiced by Matt Damon) is pulled unwittingly into an unexpected adventure to find the Titan, the last hope for humankind, and incidentally, the life work of his father.  Only Cale has the key to finding. With two other humans, Akima (voiced by Drew Barrymore) and Korso (voiced by Bill Pullman) and an odd alien crew and the interstellar ship Valkrie, he must find the Titan before the Drej find him.
About the Movie:
Titan A.E. is an interesting film in that it attempts to blend traditional hand drawn animation with the newer art of computer-drawn 3D animation. Though the effort is something of a novel enterprise, it turned out to work quite well.
Titan AE is a beautiful movie with a great deal of animation skill behind it.  It couldn't have been easy to so seamlessly integrate 3D and traditional animation, and even harder to make the human characters come off as human, rather than silly caricatures.  You feel these characters, rather than just look at them.
The 3D adds a lot to the film as well. The very beginning of the movie where the Earth is destroyed is chilling in its effect, especially when the moon gets totaled by a piece of it.  You watch that whole sequence and it hits you hard because of the semi realism and impact of the event of our home planet blowing up and destroying the moon.  The use of 3D makes the many spaceship sequences fantastic as well, especially near the end.
While these sequences could have been done with traditional animation, the impact and power of them would have been deeply undercut if done that way.  3d added a futuristic feel and a touch of realism that traditional animation can't match.  Perhaps this sort of thing is the future of animation, hybrids.  It's hard to tell.
Pontificating about the beautiful animation aside, this film is marred by its poor plot progression. It's not the plot itself that is bad, it's how the story was put together.  They try to do too much in too little time.
For instance, the director tried to jump the audience to too many locales. If you watch many of the other major sci-fi films out there, the formula is to go to no more than 4 locales in the film. Star Wars sticks to 4, as do almost all of the Star Trek movies. In the course of Titan AE, we have at least 7 major locales that the heroes visit.  The audience is jumped around to so many alien places that it's hard to keep your feet on the ground.  As a result you start to lose track a little.
Another issue is the characters.  There are 6 major characters in the movie. Three of them get fleshed out, but the other three do not, leaving the audience wondering why we should care about them, especially when something bad happens to any of them.  What are their motivations for risking it all on this crazy quest?  It's obvious for the humans, but not the others, not even in a general way.
The last issue I have with it is the casting of Drew Barrymore in the female lead as Akima.  For some reason, her voice doesn't seem to fit the character.  Maybe it's because her voice is so distinctive that it's hard to separate the actress from the voice.
The end result is a movie that drags and loses its initial impact.  For all of Titan A.E.'s spectacular animation, it ends up being a slightly subpar film.
About the DVD:
Titan AE comes in a standard hard case on a single sided DVD in anamorphic widescreen format. It has multiple audio tracks, including Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby DTS, and Dolby surround. It is contains a French audio track and subtitles are available in both English and Spanish.
The Picture quality is pretty good with few artifacts, though there is some noticeable grain on high resolution screens. The color seems muddy at times, but I think that might be the color style used in the movie.  The sound quality is excellent overall, though I was only able to test the Dolby 5.1 sound.
The Titan AE claims to be the Special Edition, even though there never was a regular edition (unless you count the video release).  It does, however, qualify as one as a DVD release loaded with special features. Among them include a Director's commentary, a making of featurette, deleted scenes, a music video based on the movie, a still gallery, Trailers, and a DVD-ROM game link for computer users.
The Director's commentary for this release is quite good, giving an animator's view of the production was put together and how 3D animation was used to enhance the film.  It certainly helps to explain some of the decisions made in the artistic design of the movie.  While this isn't the best commentary I've heard, it's sufficiently interesting enough to make it worth a listen.
Bottom Line: An attractive though somewhat sub-par film on a feature loaded DVD release. 3 star movie on a 4 star DVD. 4 Stars.",1080691200,3,5154,4.574375678610206
1285611,4,B00003CXDR,"Overall, I found this to be a fairly well-balanced movie - but not perfect.
I found the storyline believable and was pleased that some effort of scientific accuracy was attempted (note to self: empty lungs before entering the vacuum of space). I found the voice acting particularly believable - although it seemed like Nathan Lane's accent shifted toward the end.
I found the 2-D and 3-D artwork worked well - although it didn't always cut together well, particularly when shifting from 3-D scenery to the 2-D characters during the Ice Ring segment. Most of the characters were well drawn - but Stith, Janeane Garafalo's character, was bizarrely ill-proportioned (and not in the good Barbie way). The bad guys looked like extras from Tron - I can't decide if that bothers me or not.
Graeme Revell's instrumental soundtrack was excellent - but I found the hard rock songs with lyrics broke the mood. The rock video on the DVD *does* work well, but the shifting back and forth from movie to rock video in the film didn't work for me.
There are some good extras on the DVD - but the DVD-ROM game didn't work for me (a black crosshair on a black starfield equals an invisible crosshair). The making-of documentary was especially nice.
Titan A.E. is a great movie with solid DVD supplements. Your personal preferences may find a few nits to pick, but overall it's an enjoyable experience.",1078358400,3,1383,4.7907949790794975
1285612,5,B00003CXDR,"'Titan A.E.' is a fun movie. I enjoyed it thorough, despite being well outside the demographic to which this sort of movie was intended to appeal.
--Basic plot--
Don't do any heavy analysis on the plot on this one. It won't stand up to expert scrutiny. But it is a reasonably good tale. The earth has encountered a powerful enemy which threatens, and eventually does, destroy the planet. During the course earth's destruction, various spacecraft escape, including one legendary, perhaps mythical craft, named the Titan. No one is quite sure exactly what this vessel is, save that it contains the hope of all humankind, for their survival in a hostile universe.
Enter our hero, Cale (voiced by Matt Damon). A child on earth, he has grown up in space to young adulthood as a person without a home, without a planet, and thus without respect. One drifter among many, as what remains of the human race have become cosmic gypsies and vagabonds, who live as best they can while travelling around, interacting with alien cultures. As with all human beings, some are good, and some are not, and it isn't always easy to tell the two types apart. And, as with all aliens, the same is true for them.
Our hero, Cale, being the son of the Titan commander, contains within himself (unbeknownst to himself) the key to locating the Titan. Thus, the cosmic chase is on! Befriended by some who try to help, relentless pursued by the dastardly alien foes, the Drej, betrayed by those he trusted, he finally finds the Titan. Will he be able figure out the key to its operation before its destruction? Will he be able to save the human race?
--Basic plot holes and other criticisms--
This review would go on far too long if I tried to go into all of these. One must remember that the intended audience for this movie is supposed to be early teenage boys. However, one thing that the producers of this movie failed to neglect is that many teenage boys will pay sufficient attention to realise the plot deficiencies. Suffice it to say, an enemy powerful enough to destroy earth in the first place would certainly be able to destroy the Titan solution. And given the unlikelihood of our hero even surviving to adulthood, where would the human race have been left in such an occurrence? Etc., etc. As I said earlier, the movie won't stand up to such scrutiny. But for those of us who like some scientific method with our science fiction, it becomes a problem. So, strike one for the movie.
Alas, we know nothing of the energetic alien enemies - why they are enemies, why they continue to be enemies even after earth's destruction, and how it is that this all powerful enemy is wholly contained within one ship, whose destruction signals the destruction of them all. Oh well, again, I'm thinking too much for this film...
Strike two comes from an under-promotion of the star power of the film. I know many who might have gone to see this had they known, for instance, that Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Janeane Garofalo and Nathan Lane were character voices.
--The movie that saved the human race and lost a job--
Strike three comes from the targeting. The intended, intentionally-developed market for this was to be early teenage boys, a lucrative movie audience target. However, to produce an animated film for this group, who are just freeing themselves of being thought of as children, and thus leaving things like `cartoons' behind for being child-ish, was a monumental miscalculation.
Bill Mechanic, chairman-CEO of Fox Filmed Entertainment (the studio behind this film) lost his job because this miscalculation (among a few others that summer). In 1994 he spearheaded the creation of the very expensive Fox Animation Studios. While they produced the wonderful and successful Anastasia a few years ago, 'Titan A.E.' ended up being a box-office flop. Costing nearly $80 million to produce, it opened to less than $10 million the first weekend, and went steadily downhill from there.
Alas, Fox Animation Studios is now completely closed. And Mechanic is out. Which is too bad really.
--Stunning special effects--
Even for an animated film (which often gives more flexibility in doing such things as defying gravity, etc.) the effects were great. The cat and mouse game between the spacecraft in the ice region of space, with so many reflective surfaces and crashing/breaking sound effects was truly breathtaking, worthy of acclaim among any science fiction film.
In all, Titan A.E. is a good film for its genre, poorly targeted and somewhat lacking in the execution. However, if one is willing to overlook the plot holes (in the name of suspension of disbelief), this can be enjoyed. And yes, a teenage boy will most likely like it, despite it being a `cartoon'.",1057622400,3,4740,4.831488314883149

1285678,5,B00003CXDR,"""Titan A.E."" (the term ""A.E."" stands for ""After Earth""), is a fun science fiction adventure ride through future Outer Space.
PLOT SUMMARY: In 30th century Earth, the planet is in danger from the vicious, terrifying alien species known as the Drej, who plan on destroying Earth and the entire human race. In the year 3038, a young boy named Cale (young Cale, voiced by Alex D. Linz), watches his father go to fight off the evil aliens, promising that he'll return. When Cale's father doesn't return, Cale is forced to grow up alone--without a parent about. Now, flash-forward to fifteen years later. Cale has grown up (grown up Cale is voiced by Matt Damon) who is one of the few surviving humans living on a strange planet over-run by aliens. When a captain named Korso (voiced by Bill Pullman), tells Cale that the gold ring on his finger provides a map to the ship known as the Titan, which could form another planet like Earth and provide life to save the human race, he forces Cale into a long search for the ship. The search turns into an adventure for Cale when he comes across the tough, beautiful pilot, Akima (voiced by Drew Barrymore), whom he falls in love with, and three alien partners to help guide them. But when Cale discovers that Korso is evil and the Drej are after them, it's up to Cale and Akima to reach the Titan ship before Korso or the Drej can get there first.
ANIMATION: The 3-D animation is absolutely spectacular...some of the scenes look extremely real, such as the Outer Space scenes. Animation these days in films just keeps getting better and better.
VOICE TALENTS: When you put great actors together like Matt Damon, Bill Pullman, Drew Barrymore, Nathan Lane, and John Leguizamo together in one film, you know the acting will be superb. No denying it!
OVERALL THOUGHTS: I think ""Titan A.E."" was extremely entertaining and well-done. The script and storyline was well-written and the directing was excellent. There was a lot of action and it was well-paced...not too slow and not too fast. Original, and yet it still follows that rebellious-young-man-goes-on-an-adventure-and-becomes-a-hero-by-saving-the-world type of formula.
The DVD is great with a documentary featurette on the making of the film, four deleted scenes, a music video, still gallery, DVD-ROM extras, an alternative ending, and theatrical trailer. The DVD is available in wide screen format.
I highly recommend ""Titan A.E.""

1285681,4,B00003CXDR,"The story starts off with the evil Drej invading and destroy the planet of Earth. Only a handful of survivors escape the terrible destruction, including young Cale (voiced by Matt Damon). Years pass and now Cale is a young man, embittered at the whole human race, but most of all angry at his scientist father for leaving him. The human race is becoming extinct but there is still a dim hope in the mysterious project Cale's father was working on called the 'Titan project'. Cale is sought out by Korso (Bill Pullman) to help find the Titan spacecraft. So from there begins an adventure full of danger and excitement as Cale and Korso's crew try to discover the whereabouts of the Titan. The crew consists of the beautiful pilot Akima (Drew Barrymore), the annoyingly sarcastic Preed (Nathan Lane), the genius Gune (John Leguizamo), and weapons expert Stith (Janeane Garofalo).
An extremely entertaining movie, ""Titan A.E."" is certainly an interesting movie to watch. The story has its elements of being sort of a Star Wars movie with the theme about there being a hope for the future for the whole galaxy. All of the creatures and aliens (my favorites being the alien race the Gaul and the 'cockroach' chef), all have interesting characteristics and quirky sides.
The best thing about the movie is most definitely the extremely great computer graphics combined with 2D animation. The beginning where the Drej destroy Earth and the end sequence was probably the best computer graphics done in the whole movie. But of course all the starships, explosions, planets, and more were well-done also.
The characters are likable for an animation movie. Unlike some movies, all of the characters have three dimensions of characteristics. Take for example Cale, a young man who is embittered in the beginning. Throughout the movie you can see the development of his character as he soon realizes that there is still hope for the whole human race. And there's also Akima, who though at first ignores Cale, bonds with him, friendship becoming love at the end.
Here's my summary of the film: An entertaining film which I recommend for families. But the film is rated PG for some violence and some innuendo references. Let's just say that if ""Titan A.E."" was not animation, it would probably be rated PG-13. But on a good note, there is no bad language used at all. The reason for my 4 stars is that though some would find ""Titan A.E."" one of their favorite movies, I myself can't say the same thing. There are other films which I find are more fun to watch. Just my opinion but please, check out this movie if you get a chance!

I don't see why so many people say this story is similar to starwars, if so, any story involving a reckless young in space being chased by a large enemy and trying to save civilization will be starwars-like. Even Superman, Spiderman, or Aliens would be starwars like, isn't it?

Cale is tracked down by a group of freedom fighters who want to recreate Earth using a machine Cale's father invented.  The problem is they need the cynical Cale to help them activate it.

Watching this movie, I remembered vividly being eight years-old and seeing Darth Vader toss the Emperor into a vast pit and thinking ""This is the greatest thing ever.""

1285764,2,B00003CXDR,"Many critics gave thumbs up to Titan AE, the animated feature from Fox Studios, and if I did not think much of it, my opinion should not deter fans of animation and/or science fiction. There are many people who are better judges of art than I am. How Titan AE stacks up as art compared to, say, The Lion King or A Bug's Life, I cannot know. I do know that, regardless of the creative process used, a movie must still work as a movie, and on that level, I found it lacking.
Titan AE begins with the destruction of Earth by a weird race of beings who seemingly are afraid that human beings have become too technologically advanced. A space commander gets his young son safely aboard one of the evacuation craft, and then he races to escape with a ship called Titan, the one that contains the secret the attackers are so fearful of. The story then jumps forward fifteen years. The commander never returned for his son as promised. The boy is bitter. He is a maintenance worker one of the spacecraft. Apparently the human race has found no place else to live and has been floating around the galaxy all these years. One day he is approached by a man and a beautiful young woman who say they need his help. As it turns out, the ring his father gave him all those years ago is a really a map that shows the location of the Titan. They stress to him that it is imperative that the ship be found. After much coercion, he reluctantly agrees to accompany them. The enemy is hot on their heels. The race has begun.
One critic described Titan AE as the movie Star Wars fans have been waiting for. I thought they were waiting for the fifth installment of the series, due out early next summer. Haven't we sat through enough imitations of these movies? Did we really need a cartoon version? This is not a remake, but it is obvious that Star Wars inspired much of the plot, as well as the visuals. Also confusing to me is why someone would chose a space epic as source for an animated movie. I realize that many of the most famous and popular comic book series are based either in outer space or on characters from beyond. Yet, since we obviously can't film anywhere else but here on Earth, much of what we see in a sci-fi movie is animated and computer generated anyway. To me, what the producers did was to spend a whole lot of money putting together a sci-fi movie that is all drawn by hand or otherwise. In front of these 'sets' they then drew in cartoon figures. It doesn't seem to me that that counts as much of a breakthrough for animated art...",1016409600,8,2537,4.320754716981132

The sound is also great, really showcasing a quality home theater.
The movie didn't do well in theaters; my guess is that it was too action-packed for young girls, and the boys it was intended for just didn't want to see an animated movie.
It might not be a great movie, but it's more original and entertaining than much of what Disney has put out in the last few years (Pocahontas and the Hunchback of Notre Dame come to mind).
Titan A.E. would be a good addition to any home library, if for nothing else than to show off the visual and audio capabilities of your DVD player to your friends.",1015286400,2,825,4.619047619047619

I found the combination of cartoon animation and computer graphics to be curiously ugly and, worse, unnecessary.  All things are possible in the cartoon world, correct?  Why was CGI needed?  The combination only served to make them both look false.  The enemy planes looked especially fake.  The story line and plot were good but nothing unique.  Actually, it's pretty much the same story that everyone hated in ""Battlefield Earth.""  I really wouldn't recommend this cartoon to children.

Moreover, another sequence involving a high-speed chase through trees with balloon-like leaves filled with hydrogen gas left me breathless.  It's too bad that besides this animated visual feast, there really isn't anything else offered by the film.  The characters are uniformly boring and the dialogue must be aimed at retarded infants.  The soundtrack is also peppered with pretty bad generic alt-rock.  And I could not believe the size of the holes in the plot.  The writers didn't even expend the energy to explain why the Drej are trying to destroy humanity, which, you would think, ought to have been a priority considering that it sets up the entire movie.

The voice talent was excellent, the animation was the best I've seen for an American film for years, however this film borrowed HEAVILY from other flicks. First of all, there is an anime film called Lensman in which a young man becomes ""the last hope for humankind"". He ends up getting some special device implanted in his hand that can save humanity from a pure energy scourge that threatens the universe. Secondly, Titan A.E. also borrowed liberally from Starchaser: The Legend Of Orin. The starship chases and overall look was definitely an inspiration to the creators of this film. The big problem is that both Lensman and Starchaser were both pretty much animated versions of either OTHER ANIME or STAR WARS. As we all know, Star Wars was a space version of an amalgamation of George Lucas' favorite Akira Kurosawa films. Titan A.E. was also inspired by Heavy Metal, the cult animated film with different stories featuring a pulsing soundtrack. This is the other area in which my friends and I were saying to each other ""have I seen this before?"" repeatedly throughout the film. Look, Titan A.E.

DVDs are always more interesting than video tapes, in that they often have special bonus features. I looked at the cut scenes and character profiles and found them ok.

Our hero is a tinkerer frustrated by his job and position as outcast.  An old friend of his father sets him on a course much like _Treasure Island_ in space. Finding humans like himself still exist, our hero vows to find the treasure which would save the human race from extinction.  Throw in a race of aliens--who would like nothing better than to see humans extinct--and a sharp-witted love interest, and the story is a classic.

Although he liked the animation, we both thought that the storyline was far too predictable, and when they said that the bad guys were beings made of ""pure energy"" within a minute of saying that the batteries on the Titan were completely drained and the hero had to find some way to charge them, we both groaned aloud.  Furthermore, although I'd heard that the animation was spectacular, I didn't find it so at all.  There were clearly different animation techniques used, including CGI, but there was no blend between the scenes and figures created using one technique and another.

When it came to video I finally rented it, and fell in love immediately. From the breathtaking special effects, to the energizing story and an out of this world soundtrack, Titan A.E. Is quite possible one of the best animated movies ever rendered. It combines the state of the art 3-Dimensional computer graphics similar to that of ""Starwars"" and ""Toy Story"", with the hand-drawn Disney style animation to create a revolutionary animation hybrid; the birth of an entirely new style of film. Titan A.E. is a must own for children and adults alike.
The movie begins with the protagonist, Cale (Matt Damon), leaving Earth for the last time as he watches his father board the Titan (a revolutionary ship that was supposed to change man's role in the universe). Afraid of the power the human race now holds, the alien race referred to as ""the Drej"" destroy the earth in a last minute effort to eliminate the human threat. The Titan however escapes Earth and is hidden by Cale's Father. The story picks up fifteen years later when Cale is all grown up; working on a salvage station in the middle of deep space. He is soon discovered by ship captain Korso (Bill Pullman), an old friend of his father, and the vile Drej who wish to see Cale dead. The journey begins when Korso informs Cale that he is the only one who can find the Titan because his father left him a ring containing a genetically encoded map that can only be read by Cale. The story twists and turns in a race between the evil Drej and the Valkyrie (Korso's ship) and crew (Drew Barrymore, Nathan Lane, Janeane Garofalo, John Leguizamo) to find the Titan and decide the fate of the entire human race.",991785600,2,1780,4.545171339563863

Thankfully the Fox/Bluth alliance answered hopes in making both of them villains.  Wow, I should maybe ask for Harvey Fierstien or Robin Williams for my next choice!  Aside from that confusing choice of casting, the movie itself isn't too bad that it burns images into your retinas or anything, but it is, however, just shy of that.
I've seen many bad science fiction movies before, I even seen some good ones, too.  I applaud the folks at 20th Century Fox for bringing me parts of the bad ones mixed with butchered parts of the good ones.  I like seeing the Han Soloish Pullman bark out orders and sometimes even be heard.

""Titan A.E."" is a piece of weirdly emasculated SF-lite animation. The plot is extremely straightforward, with no twists of any import: basically, the ""heroes"" hop from planet to planet in search of clues, periodically getting attacked by the Drej and/or kidnapped, in which case the plot becomes a ""let's get back to our ship"" scenario. Furthermore, the storyline is riddled with cliches, but they are handled extremely clumsily: the romance between the opposite sex leads blossoms out of nowhere; the film has a lion share of ""comic relief"" characters, but they are irritating and repulsive; characters experience sudden changes in personality. Furthermore, the film can't decide on a tone: it alternates between slapstick and mature; in one scene, the hero spouts crude jokes while repeatedly kicking another prone character in the ribs. The villains are formulaic ""evil aliens"", and the majority of the film's extraterrestrials seem to have descended from Earth animals - dogs, turtles, cangaroos.

Nor, for those who are unfortunate enough to have endured a showing (you have my condolences) is it any secret as to why this occurred.
""Titan AE"" has one glowing high point and two glaring flaws.  The one high point is the visually stunning CGI ice crystal sequence near the end of the movie.  The two flaws...well, flaws don't get any worse than these.
First of all, we have the characters...er, *caricatures* might be a slightly more accurate term.  The people in ""Titan AE"" were conceived as two-dimensional cliches, half-heartedly developed as two-dimensional cliches, and shoddily, inconsistently executed as two-dimensional cliches.
Take, for example, the hero of this disgrace.  He begins the main story as a self-centered, reckless jerk who doesn't give a darn about anyone or anything, and goes to great pains to makes this clear to anyone who asks, and more than a few who don't.  (Think Han Solo, without the depth.)
Roughly a quarter of the way through the movie, having thus far evidenced no growth or change of any kind, he abruptly exchanges this shallow persona for an equally shallow role on the far side of the spectrum--as a dedicated follower of the cause, loyal to a fault.  There is no explanation given, or even a transition demonstrated.  Other caricatures are presented and dealt with in a similar fashion (the movie's primary antagonist goes through no fewer than three of these drastic, pointless, inexplicable shifts).
The second fatal flaw is the script.  Even with characters as poorly conceived and executed as these, it still might have been possible to salvage something out of the experience if the dialogue had been straightforward, playing to the story's potential as a science fiction drama.
Instead, ""Titan AE"" was burdened with a haphazard hodgepodge of one-liners, trite commentary and pointless ""kewl"" jokes whose only real connection was the fact that they were spoken by the same voice actors.  The proverbial million monkeys typing on a million typewriters...scratch that.  Five monkeys could have done a better job than the screenwriters for this travesty.
I wanted to like this movie.  I really did--the animated medium is almost tailor-made for the science fiction and fantasy genres, and a producer is not often willing to take a gamble on a project like this.  ""Titan AE"" could have been a landmark in modern film history.
Instead, it will be remembered as one of the most expensive B-movies ever made.",986083200,7,2704,5.006696428571429
1286077,4,B00003CXDR,"What?  Did an animated feature just put ""Episode I"" to shame?  I hate to say this, but yes.
At the very least, this is a wonderful film to look at.  Directors Bluth and Goldman take stills from recent deep space probes, then run with the results, using as much color as possible.  There are plenty of locales, as well, such as a beautiful nebulae and a mezmerizing, if dangerous, ice field, just to keep everyone on their toes.
Now, all this is nothing without a decent story line, or at least a sense of energy.  Never fear, friends.  This flick has both.  Taken straight from those old pulp sci-fi magazines, the story is just simple and familiar enough to evoke a sense of nostalgia.  Remember playing ""spaceman"" as kids?  And Bluth knows a thing or two about keeping it all moving, as well:  little time is wasted as this film moves itself from location to location, with swooping spaceships, daring rescues, and one of the best cat-and-mouse games I've seen in a long time.  And if it all rings a little of the early ""Star Wars"" flicks, it only serves to remind us of the innocence we wish they had kept.",985824000,,1109,4.467661691542289

Well much to my surprise, this did not happen here.  No, this is definitely NOT the next Star Wars (although I can see where there are some similarities).  But it is an enjoyable experience.  I don't regret buying this DVD at all as it has become a welcomed addition to my collection.

I thought this was a great film and is nice just to relax and watch this. It has enough violence in it to keep it interesting but not too much to make it offensive. It has that renegade feel to it that makes you want to watch it again, which I think is great. I enjoyed the soundtrack, and the visuals.. WOW!!! They were just as good in most places as a live action movie. I guess you could compare this movie to humor- if you analyze it too much, it dies.

The characters had an edge to them. Cale felt abandoned by his father who promised he'd see him again. Akima wanted nothing more then have a home again. Korso drove himself hard to find Cale and keep him. It was a nice change of pace not to have singing in the middle of the movie, instead you have a great soundtrack. The animation was great. The aliens were different from what we have seen in other films. How many films have aliens with two knees and a bad attitude? I am a 22 year old woman who just fell in love with this movie. I don't think it's just for the little boys. You have so many strong character and you can only guesswork what they have lived through. I think Don Bluth did a great job. I can only say I was disappointed to hear they shut down the production of the video game.",981331200,3,958,4.240437158469946
1286084,3,B00003CXDR,"Titan A.E. is visually stunning but lacks in just about everything else.  The music is both an original score switching off with contemporary rock including Lit's pop-rock ""Over My Head"" and Jamiroquai and Luscious Jackson hidden (or maybe obscured is a better word) throughout the movie.  This just doesn't work.  The voices of such talents as Matt Damon, Bill Pullman, Drew Barrymore, Janeane Garofalo and Nathan Lane also lack the spark that they usually have (with possibly the exception of Pullman) in traditional movies, possibly because as Barrymore commented, she felt cheesy acting things out in a sound booth.
On the other hand, the 2D animation with the 3D computer graphics is absolutely breathtaking--a landmark for animated films.  The storyline was pretty weak and ruins the movie as a whole no matter how visually beautiful it is.  Crucial plotlines like why the Drej aliens want to exterminate humans--why not other races?--just weren't explained very well even with the beginning narration.  However, the movie was a refreshing break from the inundation of Disney movies with happy characters singing happy tunes.  Parents should be aware that the movie does have violence with blood (animated of course) and brief nudity.
I think Fox simply needed to focus on a target audience, just bite the bullet--they may please less in numbers but more for the people they do please.  Then Fox would have an awesome, ground-breaking (possibly cult) film instead of a mediocre flop with potential.  However, if you like the animation enough you should definitely get this on DVD for the crisp detail.
The DVD is well organized with a very nice menu layout including these options: Sound - Digital Surround, English 5.1, English dolby surround, and French dolby surround. Subtitles - English or Spanish. Extras - Directors' commentary, Lit music video, deleted scenes/original cuts, a still gallery of over 30, a ""making of"" that was on Fox Kids (not very informative/in-depth), and DVD-ROM.",980726400,4,1997,5.196261682242991

Whats happens is a great adventure movie traveling to different planets, meeting new species,  great action and trying to save mankind.

1286173,3,B00003CXDR,"The Movie - Titan AE is one of the most visually pleasing animations I have ever seen.  The animation is a combination of traditional and computer rendered.  It's the computer animation that will blow you away.  However, the visuals are only one aspect of the movie.  Of course there are other aspects, such as the storyline, voice over, etc.  The storyline was decent, but nothing more.  Some parts dragged.  But a plot twist or interesting scene will come up and do just enough to keep you in your seat.  The voice acting could have been better as well.  Although Matt Damon, Bill Pullman, and Drew Barrymore do their best, you can't help but feel that their performances were a little dry.  For some great voice-overs in animation, check out The Prince of Egypt, and you'll see what I mean.  The largest problem I have with the movie is that it seemed like it tried to gear itself to too many audiences.  As a result, the finished product is a little unfocused, and lacks the flow that you'd experience in a great movie.  This is understandable from the financial point of view of the studio, but it ultimately hurt the movie.  The overall tone of the movie was almost too serious for young children and not serious enough for mature audiences.  I particularly did not like some of the music selected for the action sequences.  It felt awkward watching these brilliantly animated action sequences that were serious in nature with silly rock songs playing in the background.  It seemed obvious that these particular tracks were chosen to gear the film towards a younger audience.  So as far as the movie is concerned, it's a mixed bag.
The DVD-now this is where this movie shines.  I'm really happy that the FOX decided to put some effort in the DVD.  The DVD medium really lets this movie show it's stuff, especially with the options that this DVD comes with.  Now, I'm the kind of person who has my DVD player rigged up to a great high definition television and a high-end audio system (DTS, 5.1 compatible, mucho, mucho wattage, etc...), and if you are like me, you will love the stunning visual transfer and awesome sound on this DVD.  This movie shines and will shine even more if you are able to listen to it in full DTS sound.  The one opening scene and the icicle scene near the end are definitely scenes you can use to show off the great sound and visuals of your high end DVD system.  There are a couple extra features (a couple deleted scenes that aren't too special, trailers and TV spots, and a behind the scenes look) but the DTS option and great transfer are the high points of the DVD.  So if you're going to buy this DVD on the movie alone, think twice.  If you're a collector and/or appreciate stunning visuals and great sound, this one's a no brainer.",980380800,4,2772,4.5494949494949495
1286174,3,B00003CXDR,"I was looking forward to this movie. I love animation, and am always on the look out to see animated features like this one and the ""Iron Giant."" The previews made it look spectacular, however the rock and roll music made me begin to worry. The worried feeling was not off the mark either. It started off great, the visuals of the Earth getting blown up...not to mention Earth's debris taking out the moon, too...were really amazing to see. The colors and backgrounds of the computer graphics were really breath-taking. Worth seeing once.
However, once the plot gets going, it fizzles. The first incident, I thought ""okay, this is meant for a younger audience."" Then it got worse and worse and worse. By the time you get to the Ice Fields (very amazing sequence...visually), all respect for this flick was long gone. I don't want to give any of it away, but they played out the prison and betrayals scenes extemely poorly. I just couldn't buy it. Another issue that bothered me, if the Drej are a single energy unity, why do soldiers march inside the space ship?
Other than the visuals, what earned this DVD those three stars are the deleted scenes included in the extras. The featurette is a 20-minute commercial for kids which does not say anything useful about the making of the movie. Trailers and TV spots remined me why I skipped catching this flick in the theatres. However, the deleted scenes were amazing. Alot of the sequences you find in there are not completed. So, for example, there are line drawings of the characters with a CG generated background. It was very intersting to see, and provides a glimpse of a stage of animation we viewer rarely get to see.",980035200,,1671,4.667796610169492
1286175,4,B00003CXDR,"I recently saw this title on VHS, and was impressed with the animation. However, I quickly saw after watching it about 20 minutes why it didn't do so well in its theatrical run.
While the voice talents of Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, John Leguizamo, et al should be praised, the overall story was somewhat implausible and, I felt geared toward a young-teen audience, probably folks around 12-15 years of age. The musical soundtrack backed up my theory on this.
The overall story revolves around a ship known as the Titan, a ship built by humans in the early 31st century, which has the ability to actually create a planet out of nothing. An evil alien race known as the ""Drej"" swoop down on earth before the Titan can be fully activated, and completely destroy Earth. The human race, now a homeless, nomadic people, are relegated to the bottom of the galactic social order, and survive in ""drifter colonies"" made up of spaceships which survived the destruction of Earth.
As the story unfolds, the young Kale, (Matt Damon) who was the son of the Titan project's leader, is found to be the key to finding the Titan, which was hidden from the Drej to protect it. Along the way, he meets a group of humans and aliens willing to help him - but do they have other agendas in mind???
Overall, this movie was entertaining, but I felt that it didn't take itself seriously enough to qualify as an animated space epic. The movie was also too short, and there are many plot holes which should have been better explained (Why would the entire project be entrusted to one small boy, and not a group of people?) Worth a look, and there's certainly room for sequels, but based on its poor performance at the box office, I wouldn't hold my breath too long.",979776000,2,1738,4.573717948717949

Fortunately for those who didn't get to see it on the big screen, have the opportunity to view it on DVD or the less desirable VHS version.

Along with stunning visuals, the characters have the ability to draw you into the story and really lose yourself in their quest.  Matt Damon, Bill Pullman and Drew Barrymore offering their voices to these tenacious characters enable you to become more familiar and comfortable with them.  After that initial ""whose voice is that"" routine, you will realize that the actor fits the character in the same instance as Anastasia.

Now the bad points:  I almost turned it off after the first mix of CGI (computer generatored imagery) and real animation.  It was sacrilegious for them to mix the two together the way they did.  I was actaully saying out loud, ""either all CGI or none at all.""  This was one of the factors that leads me to hate American (yes I am an American too) animation, the Japanese and Chinese do a much better job at it.

The movie starts off on the earth just prior to its destruction and then just jumps to 20 years in the future. Not altogether unheard of, but a little bit about some of the experiences of the main character during that time frame would be helpful to flesh out Matt Damon's character and some of its attitudes in the future. Sure we know that he feels that his father has abandoned him, and thus he could care less about the rest of humanity, but why is he such a reckless person as indicated by the sequence where he risks his life merely to get to lunch a few minutes sooner. Additionally, showing some examples of the discrimination against humans by non-earthlings in other locations and possibly some more reasons as to the reasons behind it. Yes, the movie aims at both younger and older audiences, but to get some of the older audiences, one must go into a little more detail than one has to with the pre-adolescent crowd.
All in all, the movie was an extraordinary visual treat, but as far as the story goes, it could have been a lot better.

  I think more of the relationship between Kale and his dad would have been better and the ""friend that is really your enemy"" thing has been done to death! face off, empire, etc., etc.
 I would have liked to have seen a group of freedom fighters in desperate straights fighting it out with a race that was desperate to keep their civilization alive. Instead I got great animation and a story line about a kid that can't decide if he liked his dad or not.

I will admit, the story is a little underworked and predictable, but ""shallow characters"" is going a bit too far. Apparently, people confuse shallow with blonde-haired teen males. Go figure.
Anyway, what I really like about Titan A.E. is the raw sense of ""high"" that I get from watching it. Yeah, the graphics and special effects are spectacular, but it's also the camaraderie between the characters, the atmosphere of the surroundings, and just the grand scope of everything. This is a huge, huge movie and if you sit and watch it, you'll know what I'm talking about. Also, I really like the soundtrack for this movie. The songs really heighten the heavy-metal, techno ambience of the film, particularly The Urge's ""It's my Turn to Fly"" during that amazing flight sequence (although I still think Creed's ""Higher"" would've worked even better :).

1286347,4,B00003CXDR,"This is one of those DVD's that everyone should have in their collection, just to show off their DVD player.  The visuals are outstanding on this disc, it made me wish I'd seen it in theatres, where it would have been even more breathtaking.  The story is somewhat derivative, containing a lot of elements from Star Wars and Star Trek movies, but it's never boring, just not entirely original.  The one thing I was surprised at was the level of violence in the film, it was a little more than I was expecting, so this probably isn't a great movie for your five year old.  In turn, this makes the movie have a little more appeal for an older audience, however.  The voice acting is top-notch, Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, and Bill Pullman are just some of the actors who lent their voices to the characters.  Watch the credits at the end, and you'll find a few more celebrities you know as well...
All in all, it was a fun movie to watch, and a great film to show off your equipment and the quality of DVD.  It's not the greatest film of all time, but it's something that both a 10 year old and an adult could enjoy together.  It reminded me a lot of Transformers: The Movie, now 14 years old, and made me wonder what it would have looked like given today's technology.",976406400,,1267,4.338983050847458

Anyway, no point crying over spilt milk, but I believe that we can all help salvage this movie by buying the DVD and hoping that there is another such birth with the magnitude of talent, creativity, suave and wonder of TITAN A.E. Although it took on quite a few characteristics of 'Star Wars', the story, animation, music, and score is enough to make you a believer that animated movies can be as exhilarating as anything out there.

1286349,2,B00003CXDR,"Perhaps I was expecting too much from the creators of Anastasia, where the background digital animation and characters seemed to fit better, but I was dissapointed in the effort (or lack thereof) in this movie. While many of the digital animated scenes are great, the somewhat crude character animation kept interrupting the great background work. The story itself VERY liberally ""borrowed"" from many other, better scifi films. The entire ""orphaned boy saves everybody"" has been done to death, starting with Star Wars, all the characters were stock cliches from other films, and the ending was taken right from Star Trek II- The Wrath of Khan.  Anyone would be hard pressed to find any original ideas in this film, although there were moments where a good idea (even from someone else's movie) can come alive with the great digital animation.",976147200,3,842,5.057553956834532

'Titan AE' starts with the gut wrenching fear of runing from a race of beings so bent to the distruction of the Titan Project that they would distroy the world that it was created on. Cale, thrust into the arms of a militry officer watched helplessly with out the comfort of his father, to watch through his 4 year old eyes the only world he had ever known blown to bits.
Fifteen years later he's pulled head, or more precisely, hand first into an high stakes adventure to find his father's last project. Driven by a Han Soloish Captian and his Chewie-like co-pilot, and with a crush on the smart and daring girl from Drifter colony Cale dancing on adrenaline while following his father's footsteps through the last present given from father to son, while being chased by the energy based Drej who want Cale dead only if they can't catch him alive.",975974400,,901,4.567901234567901
1286351,5,B00003CXDR,"This has been the first animated/computerized/special f/x film to catch my attention in quite awhile ! The captivating space-flight scene with the iridescent ""wake angels"" are beautifully reminiscent of anything that new age airbrush artist Gilbert Williams would be proud to paint ! Then, there's the mesmerizing ,yet menacing star-ice crystals. This is almost comparable to George Lucas' Millennium Falcon flying through the asteroid field in Empire Strikes Back 20 years ago ! Except here every nuance in sound is also masterfully captured ;The crackling and crashing of the ice crystals as they perilously collide towards one another. There is an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia seeing the ships huddled underneath the crystals. The reflection of the ships on the ice as an added suspense and defense tactic works !The scene is one of the best. It is strongly reminiscent of being trapped in a mirror filled and mazed funhouse at a carnival...
Enough of the scenery. The story itself is wonderful and intriguing without becoming too complexed for younger audiences. The plot or story is as follows: Aliens destroy earth. Boy must save the last survivors of earth spread througout space before humanity really becomes extinct. How or what he does to accomplish this is left to be discovered for those who have not seen this incredible film...
As for the acting, without looking at the credits (other than the fact that everyone knows it's Matt Damon's voice as Cale) there are a few  actors' voices which are unrecognizeable at first which prove to be a surprise once the viewer finds out.
Don't be fooled by it's lukewarm box office activity (or lack of) and miss it. Yet, don't see it because Ebert said so.

1286353,4,B00003CXDR,"It's really a shame that this movie didn't do well in the theaters. American animaters finally took a step in the right direction by making a animated movie that didn't feel like a kids show. Unfortunetaly, due to it's poor history at the box office, we're not likely to see it's like again.
Admittedly, there were a few problems. The betrayel of Corso did seem too sudden and would have done better if only there was a little more foreshadowing. The part where Cale and Corso go through space without a space suit also bugged me.
But the good far out weighs the bad. The characters interact greatly and are easy to sympathize with. They've lost their home planet, some while they were very young. Some have dealt with it and have done their best not to grow jaded. Others let the hurt consume them. It's involving watching these characters grow throughout the film: Cale from a self absorbed jerk to someone how actually cares for example.
Many people have had several criticisms. Why did the Dredj attack? What threat were the humans? Can you imagine what humans can do with a machine like the Titan? We've already filled this planet to the point of overpopulation. Imagine what a force we'd have if we were given infinate planets to populate all to ourselves.  Corso's betrayel was too sudden. Yes, as mentioned before, I whole heartedly agree. But it was well explained, and if you watch it enough times, you can come to see how some of his actions were tainted by his bitterness.
Over all, this is a great movie. It's one of very few animations that isn't geared compleately towards children (Disney take note). It's also one that doesn't rely on irritating side kicks as it's only source for supposed humor (George Lucus take note). I hope that Fox executives will come and see some of the comments on this board, and see how out of 133 reviews (thus far) the film has averaged 4 stars. I also hope that the VHS and DVD sells do better than the box office. It would be a real shame to never see more like this.",975801600,,2016,4.538461538461538
1286354,4,B00003CXDR,"Titan AE has an enjoyable story which reminds the viewer a bit of Star Wars, but it's a lot better than Phantom Menace.  As an animation buff, I found the CGI effect used on the space ships to be disappointing. In most animated movies, all moving objects are rendered in primary colors while the backrounds are often dense paintings.  Titan uses dense rendering on the ships which make them look like they belong in a live action film. Adding insult to injury, ""the making of"" extra feature made it very clear they could have animated the ships with more simple coloring but chose not to, who knows why.",975369600,5,603,4.574074074074074

Great digital graphics and imaginative scenarios are burdened by an adolescent script, but clearly that is the intended audience so how can one fault it?  My eleven year old son enjoyed it.  So did I.",975283200,,415,4.337662337662338
1286356,2,B00003CXDR,"Is it possible that the special effects routinely used in live action sci-fi and action films have, in the last decade or so, become so sophisticated and convincing that they have simply left full-fledged animation films behind?  The stinging box office failure of ""Titan A.E."" this past summer has resulted in all the predictable head scratching, second guessing and blame-pointing that inevitably takes place among baffled and chagrined studio executives when a lavishly budgeted and massively promoted film fails to live up to commercial expectations.  Yet the reason for the film's lack of success seems almost painfully obvious.  Had ""Titan A.E."" been made in 1976, for example, (or any year prior to the release of the original ""Star Wars""), it might have seemed innovative and visionary.  One of the glories of animation has always been that it can often create visions and accomplish feats not possible in a live action format.  But when, as is the case of ""Titan,"" the imagery actually derives FROM non-animated works that have already successfully captured those visions on film, the overall effect is one not of innovation but of retrogression.  In other words, ""Titan A. E."" seems to have strangely reversed the course animated and live action films normally follow.  As a result, the sci-fi special effects and the action stunt scenes in ""Titan"" look somehow cheap and tawdry in comparison to the real ones we have seen in countless movies that have come before it.  There is simply nothing in this film to excite an audience that has seen it all before - and often in a considerably more impressive form than it is presented here.
Yet, one could almost forgive the technical inadequacy if the film's characters and storyline were not so hackneyed and old fashioned.  Here we are supposed to be watching a tale taking place in the early 31st century, yet nothing about it seems fresh or forward looking.  The story seems mired in all the tired conventions of 1950's Marvel Comic books.  Thus, we have the usual nonsense about how Earth has been annihilated by a race of vicious aliens and how it is up to a cynical, cocky and whiny adolescent (voiced by Matt Damon) to single-handedly save the human race from virtual extinction.  Now the race is on as Bob, one step ahead of his pursuers, searches the universe for the futuristic Noah's Ark - Titan A.E. - his late but obviously prescient father created to help carry on the planet should Earth just happen to someday suffer the inconvenience of being blown to smithereens.  Of course, no reluctant hero would be complete without a sassy, smart and beautiful female cohort (Drew Barrymore) to accompany him on his adventure.  Naturally, early on in their relationship, they engage in a seemingly non-stop barrage of mutual put-downs and insults - that is, of course, until they fall in love and accept the romantic destiny to which they alone have hitherto remained oblivious.  Alas, the equally bland, cardboard villains of the piece also fail to register in any way whatsoever.  (Where is Darth Vader when you need him?)  Similarly ineffective are the obligatory low comic sidekicks that no animated film of any form or stripe can seem to do without.  It seems almost impossible to believe that it took no fewer than three adult screenwriters to concoct this truly witless screenplay.  Most egregious of all is that the film has been fitted with a completely anachronistic and inappropriate rock music soundtrack that shatters any illusion that we could actually be witnessing a story taking place more than one thousand years in the future.
Admittedly, ""Titan A.E."" does boast a few effective action sequences and some mighty impressive artwork in the background.  What a shame that it is all essentially thrown away on yet another piece of under-cooked, warmed-over ""Star Wars.""  Icons are icons for a reason and should rarely, if ever, be tampered with.  As those who lost both their shirts and their fortunes on ""Titan A. E."" have found out the hard way, woe to anyone who tries!  **1/2",975196800,3,4056,4.932352941176471

I'm really depressed to hear that there probably won't be anymore movies like this. But I can sorta see why Titan bombed at its debut- it's not really aimed toward any specific age group. It looks too young and cartoony for the teenagers and adults, but a tad too violent for the kids. And how many preteens do you know who'd admit that they want to see an animated film? None.

Doing their best to make an animated knock-off of ""Star Wars"" without doing a complete take-off, Fox fails to develop a great story, or even an original story, in it's first animated epic. This flick was hyped for over a year; I remember seeing teaser trailers for it during the summer of 1999. The teasers and trailers were the best part, incorporating a great soundtrack with really cool animation, but the end product bored me and left me uninterested.
Sure, this movie is intended for a teenage male audience, but animation is not just for kids. But we'll still have to wait some time for a major studio to release a mature animated film with an intelligent and well-developed story.

I know they make some vague reference in the movie about humanity's potential being a threat to them but what kind of threat could physical beings pose to a race made of energy?  Movies that become classics start with a solid plot or premise.  This film unfortunately should have had it's main premise ""thickened up"" before the first character was drawn.

The only real problem with these, however, is that the scenes are not totally finished, and some are missing the cgi materials and others are in black and white.  However, the DVD as a whole is fantastic and a great buy. While the story is nothing to talk about, it's simplicity is what makes it so great.  It's sort of like Star War in that it takes a simple story but makes me enjoyable with great visuals and twists.  This is without a doubt the Star Wars of animation and will probably go down as one of the biggest Cult Hits in Animation.  The movie as a whole will remind you of a new age version of Heavy Metal, especially with teh rock sound track interwoven within the movie.  The only real difference between the two is that Titan is aimed at teenagers and not adults (ie, no foul language or sex).  Its also great to see a movie that depuncts the Disney formula of graphic death scenes or sing alongs.  My favorite scene in the movie is near the beginning when a character, who looks suspiciously like a cricket, has an unfortunate encounter with the guys (an inside shot at a certain Disney character?).",974160000,,1293,4.440677966101695

Titan had me on the ledge.  Titan AE started off with promise. The beginning sequence was pretty good. The 2-D and 3-D animation mixed well and the premise was kind of cool. Everything went downhill form there. The writing was poor. The characters were weak. The animation was uninspiring.  This movie seemed rushed. I have a feeling Bluth was running out of time and had to put something together fast. I have three huge problems with TITAN AE.  1. The villain: What a horrible character. This guy does 3 huge twists. Unbelievable twists. I won't give anything away.  2. The incredible escape by the main character. How stupid. And of course he makes his way...well I can't ruin this. Hopefully you'll laugh at it as much as I.  3. The aliens are terrible  I have more problems, but the main thing is the story is poor, the 2-d and 3-D animation is poor and the effects are really not so good. Bluth is much better at animals and creatures. When he gets to stretch he even does good people, but the characters in Titan, again, are very ""blah"".  If you want some Bluth spend your hard earned money on Secret of Nihm or even the Space Ace and Dragon's Lair DVDs.

It's clearly a marketing thing, they're not bad actors they just don't belong here. AND THE RIP-OFFS! Every science fiction story ever made contributed at least one line to this movie.

If you are into Anime then I highly reccomend seeing this movie it looks much better then most of the japanimation out there.  It reminds me of alot of the scenes in Star Wars Episode One all being done with computers, you can tell they took there time in making the animation.
 Now the bad:  While Titan AE clearly looks amazing the story while good is some parts, is weak in others.  Granted the story is intended more for a younger teen audience, it's kind of cheesey at times.  I really didn't like the end of the movie at all, it just kind of ended and had me going that's the end!  Other than that the DVD is really worth seeing and hearing.  The sound is also top notch so if you have a nice sound system crank it up! I definately reccomend seeing this movie it's like nothing you have seen before, but the story and acting can be kind of lame at times.

1286606,2,B00003CXDR,"Since leaving Disney, Don Bluth was once the great hope for the salvation of American animation.  Since that time, he was responsible for one great film, a few really good ones and a lot of other stuff.  TITAN A.E. is among the ""other"" stuff.
After the terribly underrated ANASTASIA, I had really high hopes for TITAN.  Since his remarkeable debut with THE SECRET OF NIMH (his best film and probably the best commercial non-Disney American animated film to date) Bluth's efforts have been spotty, with a large portion being on the downside of quality.  ANASTASIA made a statement that those days might now be behind.  Unfortunately TITAN proves otherwise.
The film opens in exciting fashion with an impressive and thundering spectacle of action, tension and good animation.  At this time I point out that the film's sound is spectacular.  It probably sounds better than any other film of the year.  There is also another great suspence sequence at the end with spacecraft playing a classic cat and mouse game in a field of ice crystals.
Unfortunately, there's a lot of stuff in between those great scenes.  I found the dialogue almost impossible to hear in spots and the character animation is very clumsy (especially considering the nice work in much of ANASTASIA) and, truth be told, the plot is totally senseless.  There is no reason behind any of it.  Not only that, but the film is just stuffed with cliche after cliche after cliche, stock characters and an ending sequence you could see a mile away.  There are a few fresh ideas like a race of wicked winged aliens, but this gets burried in the muck of a muddled and over-all dull production.
The site blurb calls TITAN under-rated, but I beg to differ; it is far over-rated given the number of positive reviews I saw when it opened (and anyone who thinks this film is more entertaining than STAR WARS EPISDODE ONE is loopy.)  If the film was ignored by audiences it is because it deserved to be.
Don Bluth left Disney to make fresher animated films, but it turns out the company he left was the true salvation of American animation.  If you want to see a great Don Bluth movie, rent THE SECRET OF NIMH or ANASTASIA.  If you want to see the best American non-Disney  animated film since NIMH go out and get THE IRON GIANT which really rocks.  But, if I were you, I'd leave TITAN A.E. to the easily impressed critics.",973641600,3,2372,4.649880095923262

I must admit though, Titan AE is probably one of the strongest films that came out this year.  From beginning to end, this film is pure eye candy.  Once the adventure gets started the pace of the film really picks up and action doesn't stop until the end of the movie.
Titan AE is a good science fiction story, with some of the best animation I have ever seen. The voices of the characters include a top notch cast such as Bill Pullman, Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, John Leguizamo and Janeane Garofalo.
At the end of the movie (VHS Version) there is a video by Lit for Over My Head, and the making of Titan AE (which is facinating).
This movie will likely appeal to Star Wars and Science Fiction fans!

1286609,1,B00003CXDR,"Ok, maybe I'm asking too much of a cartoon designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but I expected A LOT BETTER than this waste of time.
The visual effects are very good (though choppy at times for no good reason), the mechanical designs are not bad, and the characters are stereotypical but not too annoying.  But these points are completely eclipsed by Titan's train wreck of a plot and COMPLETE LACK OF COMMON SENSE.
I could go it to vicious, gruesome detail about the lack of any and all forms of logic in this movie, but I think I can illustrate my point with one example.  In one part of the movie the hero is captured by the energy aliens.  ""Oh no"", the viewer thinks, ""It will be impossible for him to escape this predicament.  Surely he is done for.""  But no, he's not in his cell five minutes before he figures out that he can escape by PLACING HIS FINGERS ON THE DOOR!  So he's escaped, BUT he's still trapped on an alien ship a billion miles from anywhere.  NO PROBLEM!  He walks into the hanger bay, boards an alien ship, and flies off when the rest of the energy monsters take off.  Then, because alien technology is SOOOO user friendly, he pilots the alien ship successfully back to his friends, leaving the aliens to wonder, ""Where'd Matt Damon go?""  Apparently, the aliens have the technology to blow up planets on a whim, but when it comes to implementing LOCKS ON DOORS, they are clueless.  The movie is chock full nonsense like this.
If you have kids, they might enjoy this movie.  If you don't mind empty, meaningless visual effects, you might like the ice field scene.  If your IQ is 70 or below, the action might give you a kick.  Otherwise, go get something that took more than 5 minutes of thought during production.",973468800,12,1753,4.471698113207547

1286611,4,B00003CXDR,"Although this movies street date is Nov. 7, I got it yesterday(Nov. 1)....let's just say a local store screwed up.  Anyways, I saw this movie in the theatres and I have to say I was rather impressed.  I've always been a fan of animated movies (Disney, WB, whatever)but this broke some new ground.  This certainly isn't a Disney flick.  Titan compares better to something like Heavy Metal 2000 (although not as gory and minus the nudity) and also borrows from Star Wars, Star Trek, and other sci-fi hits.  It has some very mature themes and that's really why it got my attention.  The video transfer of this disc is decent.  It's not the best but it's certainly not the worst.  Because this is a sci-fi movie and takes place in outer-space there is a lot of black on the screen at all times, leading to a few problems.  In some scenes, the black is a little washed out looking.  Also, the colors in some of the scenes that take place inside the ships seem too ""bleed"" into each other, but that's only in a couple, not all.  Other than these few, minor, problems, it's a wonderfully bright and (for lack of a better word) pretty transfer.  The audio is presented in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 formats, and I was surprised to find that I didn't really have a preference between them. The Dolby track is very natural sounding, with good directional audio and panning and very nice creation of atmosphere - listenOther than that it's alright to the battle in the ice field (chapter 16) to see what I mean. Dialogue is nicely clear and there's good low frequency in the mix. The DTS track sounds a little more natural, with slightly greater clarity and a more unified soundfield from channel to channel... but I found bass to be somewhat lacking. That's not to say that the tracks are bad, because they're not - in fact, both are very good. But there was no clear winner in my mind when comparing the two.  This DVD disc also contians a variety of extras, including an extensive(and interesting) commentary track.  It also has the making of feature, 2 trailers and 3 TV-spots, Lit's ""Over My Head"" music video, and others.  It also has THX's optimode since this is a THX certified disc.  All in all, if your a sci-fi fan, an animation fan(like myself) or a little of both, this movie is is well worth you time.",973123200,22,2312,4.4952153110047846

The animation is good, and there are some pretty funny parts. I would've liked it better if it had a more adult theme, but on the whole it was pretty enjoyable!",972864000,8,562,4.311320754716981

1286717,4,B00003CXDR,"Alot of people like myself have already made major investments in previous movie formats (8mm, Laser Disc, VHS, and before that Beta), so I for one, have lots of experience with shelf space and dust...too much of one and not enough of the other.  Consequently, I have become selective in what I choose for my DVD colection.  I will reinvest in DVD only to update my top thirty movies (you know the ones you have a need to play more than thrice-a-year), and the best of the new movies being released.  With that said, the SPECIAL EDITION TITAN A.E. on DVD will definitely not collect dust and very rapidly advance to your personal ""best"" list, as it did mine.
SYNOPSIS:  In the century 3000, the Drej, fearful of what earth (and earthlings) can become with its new technologies, attack a not-so-unexpecting earth.  Earth's last hope is a gigantic ship called TITAN.  Evacuating earth just before the Drej destroy it, military protocol separates Sam Tucker, the creator of TITAN and his gifted young son Cale, who's fate is entrusted to Tek, an alien friend.  Fifteen years later Cale, working as a junk recycler is found and solicited by Korso, an old associate of Cale's father.  Korso shows Cale that the ring his father gave him, with activation, illuminates a map thru Cale's genes which will locate TITAN.  Korso, Cale and the crew of the starship Valkyrie; Akima, Preed, Stith and Gune, embark on a quest to find the TITAN.  Earthlings, now considered the scattered scum of the universe are again hunted as the Drej seek to destroy TITAN by capturing Cale at all cost.
  The SPECIAL EDITION TITAN A.E. DVD contains several bonus features which for a change can be considered bonus because the feature itself is stand-alone-good.  The Fox featurette ""The Quest for TITAN"" is good and gives insight into the creation of the movie, examining every aspect of the film from prop concepts to the enjoyable (really!) music.  This is family mind candy for the jaded HEAVY METAL (movie) set, myself included.  The four DELETED SCENES, are an intersting mix of fully and/or partially animated backgrounds and characters that either elaborate on a particular scene or show an alternate view.  They do not however add or subtract appreciably to the movie.  One of the best scenes in the movie is the race between the ""Wake-Angels"" and the Valkyrie in a spectacularly colorful nebula region of space.  This scene's music being very reminiscent of a long ago Star Wars Xmas special featuring a minature halographic concert at Chewie's place.
  Special effects are better than great, they are mesmerizing, and I don't classify that by saying ""for an animated feature"".  The imagination and ingenuity in the presentation of detail is...wow.  Example, look at the reflections on metal surfaces or the aquatic-like reflections inside the starship during travel...wow.
The voice characterization, contrary to a well known critic's opinion are not bad, just not reflective of the well-known names behind them.  John Leguizamo (Spawn's Clown) as Gune never fails to reveal a new aspect of his talent.  Drew Barrymore as Akima is also surprizingly good.  Janeane Garofalo (Mystery Men's The Bowler's daughter) is Stith, Matt Damon is Cale, Bill Pullman is Korso, Nathan Lane is Preed, Ron Perlman is Cale's father, Tone-Loc is Tek, etc.  As you can see, quite a bit of talent here, professionally more interested in film character than name recognition.
  You will enjoy watching this movie more than once, alone or with the kids.  Its wonderfully lightweight, inventive and if scrutinized, satisfying in visual and audio re-discovery.  To me if it gets off the shelf more than thrice-a-year it's a classic but this one, well...wow.",972777600,4,3715,4.983766233766234
1286718,4,B00003CXDR,"Move aside Terminator 2 there is a new home cinema showcase to boast to all your friends in town.  This transfer of the DVD is the best transfer of a movie yet since Saving Private Ryan. Mastered in THX the good news is that it also includes all the audio tracks like DTS, Dolby Digital 5.1 and surround in one DVD. This would also help in explaining the disappointing brevity of the movie itself.  But lots of the now mandatory extras make this DVD worth the price of admission.  I only wished that they had included the deleted scenes into the main movie instead of offering it as extras.  This would have helped in prolonging it somewhat.  Its often been said that if an animated movie were to exceed 90 minutes it would commit box-office suicide but seeing that this movie was targeted at more mature audiences then your usual Disney fare it should have been longer.  The special effects are top notch snd the action sequences leave you breathless.  Just like disney's Dinosaur, Titan A.E. was more interested in showcasing its special effects and computer animation then trying to get you hooked to a multiplot storyline.  But I felt that even though the plot and storyline was simple it was told well.  All in all a simply awesome DVD to add to your collection.

1286722,5,B00003CXDR,"Titan A.E. made me feel like a kid again, mainly because it was out and out fun. Sure there is nothing new in the film, though it does throw some concepts of alien life into the mix that most of the movie going public may not have seen before. What this film really did was inspire a degree of awe within me that I haven't felt since Starship Troopers. There are sequences in Titan A.E. that had my mouth open- the Valkyrie racing through a nebula as it dances with wake angels and leads them on a merry chase around columns of gas or the chase through the chase through the hydrogen trees as Cale and Akima attempt to escape from the Drej Stingers. The movie mixes traditional animation with computer graphics quite nicely, and while the meshing is not always perfect, it is for the most part exceptionally well done.
 Titan A.E.'s story is simple. Basically it's the 30th century and Dr. Tucker has perfected a form of matter conversion on a planetary scale that has enabled him to utilize specific forms of energy to power a device that can create a planet. This device is a massive space craft know as the `Titan', and as the movie starts we see the massive evacuation of the planet as a Drej capital ship decelerates from hyperspace and begins launching Stinger attack ships. The Drej want the Titan destroyed, because they are susceptible to its energy collectors since they themselves are energy beings spawned off by the Drej Queen. Young Cale Tucker (Matt Damon) is dragged away from his father after being gifted with a ring from his dad to remember him by. Cale watches in horror as the Drej Planet Smasher obliterates the Earth while Stingers destroy escape ships. The Earth explodes, its debris vaporizing other ships while other pieces smash into the moon. The Titan escapes by jumping into hyperspace.
 Humans, as a species, have been reduced to the trash of the galaxy, slowly dying out they cluster in drifter colonies of old ships that have been welded together.
 Fifteen years later Cale is working as a junk collector on a deep space salvage station. He is also a minority species in a galaxy of aliens. This enables him to experience racism on a cosmic scale and a nice play on our own world's racial problems. Cale is outside when a sleek starship drops out of hyperspace and is piloted by a beautiful Japanese girl named Akima (Drew Barrymore), instantly smitten Cale heads inside the station where he is met by Korso (Bill Pullman) who informs Cale that he is needed to fulfil his father's dream and recover the Titan. Cale is more than a little reticent since he feels as though his father abandoned him. Korso convinces him otherwise by showing him that the ring Cale's father gave him activates a genetic signal in his body to make a star map appear on Cale's hand that can lead them to the Titan and mankind's salvation. Cale reluctantly agrees, if only escape the attacking Drej.
 Titan A.E. is a fantastic film for young and old. There are some messages contained here, but they are mostly common sense ones about friendship, survival, understanding and redemption. It is also, of course, a love story as Cale and Akima are drawn ever closer together from their less than auspicious beginning. The voice acting is above par, though the rock and roll music score left something to be desired and the film would have been better off with a purely instrumental score.
 This movie succeeds in so many categories, whether it be a never ending series of gorgeous visuals to great action sequences, the film shines. It has good heroes and good, if under used, villains. Where it falls apart are the actual aliens themselves; they are uninspired, making me feel as if Bluth's team had gone for goofy rather than actually making them appear alien. I am also not convinced that I can actually see the $70 million spent on this film on the screen. The 1989 production of Otomo's `Akira' cost over a billion Yen, about $12 million making it the most expensive animated movie ever made in Japan, and its quality and visuals match those of Titan A.E. However, this film is more than adequate to divert people's attention away from the sickly sweet Disney fare. More importantly, it's straight forward science fiction is pretty much flawless in its execution.",971222400,7,4274,4.693333333333333

The  graphics in Titan A.E. may not be as brilliant, but at least the story is  better, if only by a little. But I can't ignore those boring characters and  the plot holes any longer. Despite a decent story, it still looks like it  was put together in a day or so, and the characters are utterly flat. And  gawd is the animation pitiful! It's not as horrible as Pokemon, but it  still gets bad at some parts. Now take another movie with a very wimpy  story. Road to El Dorado. Yeah, it was a weak movie, but it was damn fun,  and the animation was top notch. With Titan A.E., they had a serious story,  but the studio didn't know what to do with it. Everything was by the  numbers, and nobody took a chance, something Dreamworks likes to do, even  if some of their movies are a little bad.

1286811,5,B00003CXDR,"Titan AE, the greatest insult to the world of art was that it bombed at the box office and secured that fox will never make an animated film for  years and don bluth will have a ring around his name in hollywood.
But  why is this? i don't know, this film was awesome, an instant classic. Many  people talk about iots refference to other films, this film was written by,  among others, joss whedon (creator of buffy) and john august (writer of  GO), any referrence, like the many there are, are VERY deloiberate. The  film symbolisies the future of sci-fi, animaiton, as well as paying tribute  to the sci-fi genre as a whole. Other refereences being classic pieces of  cinema such as the Lady from Shanghai hall of mirrors scene given an  amazing new twist of style.
The animation is wonderful, aweosme, why?  finally there is an animated camera here. It feels like a real film, the  'camera' pans around the characters making them feel part of this universe.  The characters also, Don Bluth has stood firm and not succombed to the  disney style of aniamtion, or the new dreamworks style, both of which are  infancy crowd pleasers. This is a mtaure, almost *)s retro look. The  soundtrack is also reminiscent of the 80s, a time of rebelllion, a new age,  the 80s were actually a whole let better than the 90s.
The short revbiew  would be that titan ae is a mature animated film from don bluth with a  sci-fi setting and small slice of stylised manga from across the globe.  See, the film, and i defy you to not enjoy it, the voice talent is  brilliant, non stereotypical, realistic, it may sound odd in reference to  aniamtion, and sci-fi, but it feels more 'real' than your average american  animated offering.
Buy it, watch it, love it. It was a great injustice  that a great tribute and benchmark in modern animation was greated by such  bad press and poor box office pulling.

I think producers tought that it would be very very expensive to shoot a spacemovie and maybe they couldn't handle special FX so they shot a cartoon.

1286815,2,B00003CXDR,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. And some of the computer generated visuals ARE stunning - I left the theater feeling I'd got $8  worth of visual stimulation. And I might rent it once on DVD.
But the  characters are paper thin - both the character animation and the character  development. The plot is a chase-movie amalgam of Star Wars with broad  concepts from other sci-fi standards thrown in. Titan didn't bomb at the  box office because it wasn't marketed well. Iron Giant bombed because it  wasn't marketed well. Titan bombed because it wasn't a particularly good  movie.
Other reviewers have compared this with:
= Star Wars Ep. 1 -  similarly visually stunning, and similarly lacking in plot and character  development. But hey - it's a Star Wars movie. The plot has been  established already, this is just backstory.
= The Matrix - another movie  with great visuals and bizarre plotting, but here at least the plot is  somewhat original and makes you think a bit. The characters had depth.
=  Ghost In the Shell - anime marrying CGI and hand drawn techniques, for  adults. Great visuals with plot nobody can follow, but what you can figure  out seems pretty intellectual.
= Disney's Movie of the Year - Disney aims  a bit lower in minimum audience age than Titan, but most of Disney's  neo-classics are well drawn and plotted. The best of the bunch handily beat  Titan as a movie (Beauty, Tarzan, anything from Pixar), and a few match it  in visual appeal as well (Tarzan, anything from Pixar).
= The Iron Giant  - another mix of hand drawn/computer generated animation, also without song  and dance or animal sidekicks. Unlike Titan, this one has not only a good  plot, but even a strong message. True, it's a bit derivative from E.T., but  it does more than just copy the plot - it gets the tone right, too. The  characters grow and learn from one another, and by the end of the movie you  care about them.

1286816,4,B00003CXDR,"Well, despite the fact that this movie didn't receive the hottest reviews and my good friend's kids hated it, I really enjoyed it.  I saw it three  times.  Cartoon animation mixed with high-tech computer animation was an  interesting combination that gave this movie a unique, non-typical feel.  The music sequences were also great (enough to make me want to buy the CD -  which I did by the way).
I don't know exactly what could have been done  to make this movie more popular at the box office.  Most of the complaints  I heard had to do with the fact that the cartoon animation was very basic  and the sequences featuring computer-animation made the cartoon animation  look cheap.  I guess that's true to some extent.  But it kinda grew on me  as the film progressed.  I liked the fact that the creators didn't turn the  movie into another CG dominated kid-flick.  This movie also has more drama  than it does action/adventure and all the groovy special effects that most  people (especially younger kids) expect from movies these days.  Personally, I thought it was great.  As a matter of fact, I liked it better  than Star Wars Episode 1, which I thought was a major  disapointment.
Titan A.E. was just a cool flick, from my perspective.  I  liked the story, the characters, and the music was hot.  The computer  animation scenes were great but the cartoon animation was totally cool too.  My favorite scenes (to name a few) were the flight through the hydrogen  trees, Cale's chase with the Wake Angels (featuring the kickin' tune  ""It's My Turn To Fly - by The Urge"") and also at the beginning of  the movie when he's riding his ""rocket bike"" through all the  space junk (with the jammin' tune ""Cosmic Castaway - by  Electrasy"" blasting in the background).
This wasn't the hottest  flick I've ever seen and, yes, there were a few yawn moments throughout the  pic, but overall I loved it!  I will certainly ad this one to my  collection of vids when it's released.",967075200,2,1970,4.6384839650145775
1286935,5,B00003CXDR,"Okay let`s get one thing clear hear before I start my review of ""Titan A.E."" this super animated movie is NOT ""a copy of  other sci-fi films"" like most people have been saying about this  movie! I`m a big fan of Sci-fi movies (Star Wars, Indapendens Day, ect...)  and I don`t see anything that are the same with Titan A.E. and other sci-fi  films! Well anyways back to what I think about Titan A.E. The movie as a  sweet story to it, it`s directed by one of my favorit directers Don Bluth  (All dog`s go to heavin, The secret of NIMH, and The land before time) and  the animation is out of this world!  I`v seen this movie in theaters 3  times, and I still never get board of it! Well just forget what other  people say about Titan A.E. this movie is a great Sci-fi and for you  animation lovers out there (including me) it is the animated movie of the  year, so do your self a favor and buy a copy of Titan A.E. when it comes on  video and DVD because it`s a great movie!",966988800,,972,4.1063829787234045
1286936,4,B00003CXDR,"Well, a round of applause here for a good try on FOX's part to bring an somewhat original animation to the screen, unlike Disney who uses the same  old story again and again and again.  Maybe that's why Titan A.E. failed at  the box office, because the story isn't wide known among the youngs,  therefore they didn't take their parents to see it.  Too bad, because I  thought that in the animation aspect Titan A.E. was very successful  actually, lots of eye candies, great looking visuals, what lacking is the  plot itself, quite a few holes and many times unbeliable, even for a sci-fi  movie.  There isn't really much more to be said about Titan A.E., but I  hope that FOX and other big name studios will participate in the animation  genre (maybe they can bring more Japanese anime on to the US screens,) I  for one is a little bored with Disney's effort and formula.",966902400,,871,4.506410256410256

1286938,3,B00003CXDR,"This was not the best animated SF ever.  Nor was it the worst.  In all  honesty, this movie had both good and bad points.  First of all the good  points.
John Leguizamo and his kooky scientist character was a breath of  fresh air.  They were amusing and the combo of art and voice was perfect  for that character.  The voices of the remaining characters were adequate,  neither exceedingly poor nor outstandingly wonderful.
The music for this  movie was decent although a little heavy on contempory so it can never be  considered a ""classic"".  It is far too rooted in the  times.
There was an abundance of eye candy.  The ""Drej"", their  ships, the ""Wake Angels"" and several explosions were all very  well done.  A visually stimulating movie.
Planet Bob.  (If you've seen  the movie, you know what I mean.)
Now the bad.
Physics went out the  window several times (the worst of which was when a character says while in  space, ""from now on we're in 'silent mode'"".)  No air means no  sound, people!
Some things are never explained.  I cannot give anything  away but I will say that an escape is made with no explanation as to how it  was performed.  We watch the entire thing but it makes no sense.
Finally,  the number of things taken from other SF was staggering.  While in lesser  amounts this would have been fine, the sheer overwhelming quantity was  distracting.
All in all, I did enjoy the movie but I do recommend  watching it with lowered expectations.",966297600,,1459,4.596078431372549
1286939,3,B00003CXDR,"In the minds of young boys (I'd say between 7 and 14), this movie ranks right up there with Star Wars.

1287030,4,B00003CXDR,"I agree that this film did not live up to the hype surrounding it. The hand-drawn animation with the interlaced CGI and other effects produced a  visually interesting film. There were several gorgeous animation scenes  (wake angels^^, ice asteroid mirror-maze), but the plot wasn't up to par.  And how many sci-fi film references were there in that?;) I can understand  maybe wanting to pay homage to a film - but not that many and not that  obviously;) Haven grown up on sci-fi resulted in making the already  easy-to-follow story seem even more predictable.
However, I'm glad that  some one in America has created a animated feature directed toward older  audiences. Perhaps the movie industry will begin to realize that animation  can accomplish more than just being for kids...
Perhaps if I hadn't  already watched so many sci-fi films and visually stunning anime, the film  would've seemed more fresh and interesting to me. Unlike other reviewers, I  don't think this is at all the best animation can be. The hand-drawn  animation could've been better and the characters could have had more  development.

1287031,5,B00003CXDR,"The summer of '00 did have something fun to offer us!  I remember first hearing of Titan A.E. about the same time as everyone else . . . when  watching The Phantom Menace.  Fox started promoting this one in the  theaters a whole year before it was released, and for good reason.  Titan  A.E. kicks major butt!  But I'm afraid, once again, that it will go  relatively unnoticed by Joe Moviegoer because most animated movies don't  appeal to the average viewer, and it's not a stale Disney Broadway farce.  Just do me a favor and give it a try.  The critics are fairly split on this  one, but if you have an ounce of adventure in your blood, and like non-stop  action, you should dig this one.  Titan A.E. harkens back to the good old  days of sci-fi before all this cyberpunk garbage (besides The Matrix) was  brought into being by William Gibson.  It's got spaceships, faster than  light travel, a really nasty alien race, lots of other aliens, tons of  explosions, exotic locales, treachery, love, and GREAT looks.  The film  seamlessly integrates computer generated animation with cell animation with  two sequences as examples springing to mind.  The destruction of Earth and  the cat-n-mouse game in the Ice Rings . . . the later being one of the  coolest sequences I've ever seen in a sci-fi flick, animated or live  action.  Sure it borrows a little bit here and there from other sci-fi, and  the creation of New Earth at the end is pretty far fetched, but who cares!  This is great sci-fi space opera stuff.  Don't let the fact that it's an  animated movie stop you from seeing it...only a crusty old relic with no  imagination will dislike Titan A.E., and it's just too much fun!

1287034,4,B00003CXDR,"Tired of the sing-songy atmosphere every year from Disney animated features?  I know I am!  Although Titan A.E. had only a fraction of Disney  numbers in terms of a box-office gross, I found it to be a welcome relief  from the typical Disney formula.  It's true that Don Bluth was once a  Disney animator before he struck out on his own with The Secret of NIMH  (remember that one?), but his work distances itself from most Disney  cliches.
What a stunning visual treat this film is!  The only problems  I had with it is that the story tended to drag at times and the use of CGI  is a bit excessive.  I personally have nothing against CGI, but I believe  it should compliment an animated film rather than dominate it.  Overall,  quite an achievement!
So why did it not do well at the box office?  Simple.  Lack of marketing.  Americans have not yet learned to market an  animated film obviously geared to anyone older than twelve.  Ad agencies  see an animated film is being released, the first thoughts are of  merchandising  (i.e. - Happy Meal promos, action figures, T-shirts, etc.).  Miramax (going off on a slight tangent here) had similar problems with the  American release of Princess Mononoke, an excellent anime film that happens  to be the highest grossing film at the Japanese box office second only to  Titanic.  Its PG-13 rating restricted it to mostly the arthouse circuit and  brought its final American gross to about 2.5 million (compared to about  150 million in Japan).
But getting back to Titan A.E., it's disappointing  to see it suffer the same fate as last year's The Iron Giant.  Hmmm...I  wonder how they would have done if they both had the Disney name slapped  all over themm....",966038400,2,1707,4.6745762711864405

What this film's REAL strength lies in is quite possibly THE most amazing  visuals I have ever seen in a film.  I'm an avid, diehard Star Wars fan who  LOVED Episode One...and on a visual level, Titan A.E. kicked the (ahem) out  of it.  Almost every single scene had my roommate and I ""oooh""ing  and ""aaah""ing.

7917800,3,B00003CXDR,"Created at a time when the fractured frontier of animation was moving toward cgi and away from trad hand-drawn palettes Titan A.E. met the brave new world with a pseudo-embrace; the primary characters are all hand-drawn while much of the alien race and some ice crystal planetoid spaces are cgi.  Its all integrated pretty well and I think it was a smart move to show the aliens in this cgi against a more natural (for the time) hand-drawn backdrop.  The sci-fi story of a young boy being Noah-ed away from his bio-family in order to be saved but not ending up in Pharoahs court and instead having to be content with grunt work on the outskirts of scuttled space debris who is ultimately found by remnants of his fathers and brought along to find the Titan project is a decent but not ambitious story.  For us humans the kangaroo alien is hard to wrap our mind around with her weird bow legs (where do they begin and end? Wheres the middle? It was very distracting) and the Brit sounding snobbish thin alien is, well, just a bad caricature but the evil electronic alien race definitely feels alien, though they too because of how they shimmer are hard to get ahold of visually.  Titan A.E. is aimed more at teenage boys and also the adult market who might have been following Don Bluth to see where he was going.  The voice cast starring the likes of Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Janeane Garofalo, comedian John Leguizamo, and (for heavens sake!) even hip hop star Tone Loc(!) were all definitely aimed at a more hipster young adult crowd.  Because of this the littler ones likely won't find as much to latch onto and enjoy, and sensitive youngsters may be put off by some of the violence and some of the alien otherliness.
