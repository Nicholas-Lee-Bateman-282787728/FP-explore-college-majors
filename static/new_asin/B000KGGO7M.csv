8494836,5,B000KGGO7M,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: Man am I having fun watching these old/new-to-me eps! First, the comedic slow burn that Stacy did when Clinton teased her about her age is one of the best WNTW moments IMO. (And that face! ... but I digress.) Second, I came away thinking that no contributor went more from Plain Jane to complete knockout than Michelle B. did, and I was happy to get backup on that when I read that Clinton picked this ep as one of his all-time favorites for that very reason. It really was amazing. Third, Michelle's little dog was adorable and while he didn't seem to need the attention he couldn't stop attracting it, in a variety of amusing ways. In conclusion, I was sure S and C taking on a dog show handler was gonna be great, and it was!
3) Oh yeah, the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. Yet if you do spring for this ep you certainly will enjoy it.

SIDE NOTE TO AMAZON, TLC, AND DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
