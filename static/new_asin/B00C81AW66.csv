5696921,3,B00C81AW66,The Two Duccio Tessari Ringo flicks are the main reason for this although the other sequels have their moments. Tessari was always an interesting director and he seems to have fun here tweaking the genre conventions. The prints are just okay and at least on my set only available in dubbed prints. Italian with subtitles would have been better.,1398470400,,344,4.8474576271186445
5696922,3,B00C81AW66,"A PISTOL FOR RINGO (aka BALLAD OF DEATH VALLEY): 1965 Non-anamorphic widescreen (black bars on top, bottom and sides).  Directed by Duccio Tessari.  Soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.  Light-hearted story of sharpshooter smart-aleck Ringo (Guiliano Gemma as Montgomery Wood) who agrees to help the local sheriff out of a tight spot when banditos hole up in the ranch of his fiance's father.  I'm not a big fan of the spaghetti western comedy, so this one didn't do much for me.  (This isn't a comedy in the manner of the TRINITY films, just more humorous than average)  Transfer was about average for these multi-packs.  Soundtrack was disappointing considering it comes from Morricone.

THE RETURN OF RINGO: 1965 Non-anamorphic widescreen.  Directed by Duccio Tessari.  Soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.  Starring nearly the same cast (and theme song singer) as A PISTOL FOR RINGO, leads me to believe they were probably filmed back to back.  Giuliano Gemma stars again as the title character, this time a returning soldier from the Civil War.  Gold has been discovered in his town since Ringo's been gone, and a family of bandits have taken over the town - and Ringo's wife.  I got whipsawed with this film - since the first was sort of a comedy, I expected this one to be as well, but it's serious most of the way through.  I kind of thought this one was boring though, which is unforgivable for these hyperactive westerns.  Transfer ok - washed out but ok.  Another disappointing soundtrack.

RINGO; FACE OF REVENGE: 1966 Non-anamorphic widescreen.  Directed by Mario Caiano. Music by Francesco De Masi.  Here's your standout, and probably makes the whole collection worthwhile (depending on the price).  Anthony Steffen and Euro-film stalwart Frank Wolff star in that old standby storyline of untrustworthy partners seeking a fortune in gold.  This one had the best all-around acting, storyline, soundtrack, and transfer of all the films on the disc.  I have no idea how&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this/dp/B002ZW6NRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this</a>&nbsp;disc manufactured on demand by Sinister Cinema looks, but I'd be very surprised if it's any better than the one on this collection.

SHOOT, GRINGO...SHOOT!: 1967 Widescreen (The product information for this collection says 1.85:1, which looks about right to me, but only for this film.)  Directed by Bruno Corbucci (as Frank B. Corlish).  Close second to FACE OF REVENGE.  FLIPPER television star Brian Kelly swims into Mediterranean waters to play Chad Stark, an escaped convict who, to avoid hanging, agrees to bring back a prodigal son (Fabrizio Moroni) from a band of outlaws led by the ever-cantankerous Keenan Wynn.

If you don't like Italian Westerns, you're certainly not going to see anything here to change your mind.  If you do, this seems like a nice selection, with a couple of films I don't believe get collected on too many multi-packs.  A PISTOL FOR RINGO and THE RETURN OF RINGO seemed a little below average to me for Italian Westerns, SHOOT, GRINGO...SHOOT! right at average, and RINGO; FACE OF REVENGE slightly above.  As of this writing, the price of this disc is hovering right at 6 clams.  I consider it a good deal at that price, but the 'deal' would fall off quickly if the price were to rise.  These films aren't too bad, but there's little of that bizarre quirkiness that I appreciate so much from this genre.  They're quite a bit more straightforward, which might actually appeal to some viewers more.

Last note - For having four films crammed onto a single sided disc, I noticed very little pixellation on our 52 inch screen.",1388880000,12,3659,5.133671742808799

5696924,5,B00C81AW66,"Nice packaging of four spaghetti westerns. Two star Giuliano Gemma in his seminal role as Ringo. Those movies made him a star in the genre and led to a host of imitations using the name Ringo in the title(the second of which I'd looked for for years; Youtube had only the original Italian language version and i don't speak Italian). One of these is here starring another spaghetti veteran, Anthony Steffen.

Not a bad buy if one is a fan of the genre as I am.",1378252800,10,460,4.348837209302325
5696925,4,B00C81AW66,"TIMELESS MEDIA 4-movie packs are a fair deal. I own several and find the transfer quality quite satisfactory. There's no subtitles or other extras here, just four English-dubbed rather obscure Euro westerns.

If AMMY's Product Detail for running time is accurate, these films are complete dubs.

The first two Ringo pictures had the same main cast and writer/director: Duccio Tessari. He did some scripting on Sergio Leone's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-FISTFUL-OF-DOLLARS/dp/B00000K0DM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS</a>&nbsp;(Italy/Spain/W.Germany-1964). Star Guilano Gemma was billed on both Ringos as Montgomery Wood. Gemma was working as a stuntman when director Tessari gave him the co-starring role in his swords & sandals film, MY SON, THE HERO (Italy/France-1962).
