7834963,3,6303038212,"Overall, The Return is an okay Bonanza to have. It's about a murderer, who claims to have shot someone's son is a fair fight, who returns to Virginia City to get settled. Nobody cares for him nor likes him. But the Cartrights hire him and try to help him out. Then he tries to run away with a girl he loves, the man who's son got shot's daughter. How bad is that? But it has a very surprising ending. So if you really wanna see a great Bonanza, I suggest trying to find The Flapjack Contest, Woman of Fire, Springtime, The Smiler, or The Wooing of Abigail Jones.",1029715200,5,562,4.212962962962963
