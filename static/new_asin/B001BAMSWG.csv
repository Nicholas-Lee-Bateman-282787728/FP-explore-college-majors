8282507,4,B001BAMSWG,"I haven't seen this 2008 drama, but it sounds good; so for the sake of saying my piece I gave it 4 stars.  Kwon Oh Joon (Jang Hyuk who starred in the drama Thank You) is a swindler who falls for a widow with a 5 year old daughter, Jin Dal Rae. Dal Rae lives with her daughter and mother-in-law after her husband passes away. Oh Joon is a suave man who can talk women into doing anything.

The Korean database calls it Robber.  Other titles include Thief, Con Man, Bandit, Scoundrel.  Bad Guy or Bad Boy (I've seen both titles used) is a Korean Drama from 2010 that is entirely different; and I look forward to Amazon picking it up when it becomes available on DVD.  I've seen a little less than half of it and so far it's 5 stars.",1283385600,2,730,4.112676056338028
