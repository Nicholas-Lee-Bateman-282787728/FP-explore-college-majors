8535539,3,B009440MKQ,"I was really hoping to get a better view into the life of Villopoto, not his career.  I've been watching RV race every weekend since he showed up in the AMA.  I felt like the interviews were surface deep and too short.  The riding sections were a bit drawn out and got a little boring.

I hate not giving this 5 stars, because RV is one of my favorite riders.  I just felt a little let down when it was finished.  For a very good documentary, check out CBS's Ryan Villopoto Champion.",1363478400,3,483,4.195652173913044
