5319907,1,B009DEHF9S,Speedy shipping! Excellent seller! Lousy movie! Much advertised movie that is tasteless and has no substance as far as the plot is concerned! This is for those who enjoy masala and bickering!,1353888000,3,191,5.0
5319908,5,B009DEHF9S,"Great and I do Mean Great performance by Abhishek who, whether he wants to be or not , is a master of physical comedy. If you loved him in Dostana and love Ajay's wry wit and machismo (don't worry they both get to have action scenes)then you will absolutely love this one .

 The supporting cast is stellar and the laughs plentiful. Put your worries away and enjoy this moment in time. This is not the original mousetrap of humor. It's a better one. Thanks Guys you did great.",1347235200,6,476,4.337078651685394

8540262,5,B009DEHF9S,"I have recently become smitten with Bollywood movies and this one was great. It is funny, over-the-top, and stars two of the hunkiest men acting in the world today -- Devign and Bachchan. I can't understand a word of Hindi, but love hearing the beauty of the language.

If you are looking for a comedy and can appreciate that the humor and action scenes are meant to be over-the-top, then you won't be disappointed.",1373846400,,415,4.608108108108108

8540264,4,B009DEHF9S,"Bol Bacchan in street lingo is a person who blows a lot of hot air.
Bol Bachchan is loosely based on Golmaal, its basic idea is similar to this movie about an employee who initially lies to hide a fact but then has to continuously lie all the time. The other similarity is that during a scene in this movie the original Golmaal is seen playing on TV. Fox Star studios purchased the right but the makers decided that since they cannot compete with the wit of the original they decide to pay homage in their own way.
Golmaal was subtle and gentle but Bol Bacchan has been conceptualized by Rohit Shetty , the grand master of flashiness and flamboyance, so even in a subtle movie as this he finds time to blow up cars and high speed chases. It starts with a boisterous title track featuring Amitabh and the two protagonists, Ajay Devgan and Abhishek Bachchan.
Abbas Ali (Abhishek Bachchan) and his sister Sania (Asin Thottumkal)  who have lost their ancestral property to their uncle in court. They have nowhere to go, so they move to Ranakpur from Delhi with their late father's best friend, Shastri (Asrani). Shastri works for Prithiviraj Raghuvanshi (Ajay Devgn), the village boss. An incident in the village square causes Abbas's friend to christen him as Abhishek Bacchan.  Abbas gets a job at Prithvi's estate under this fake name. This incident creates a web of lies and several inventions such as a fake mother and an feminine brother Abbas.
The pace slacks here and there but the two leads Ajay Devgan and Abhishek Bachchan bring the house down with their amazing chemistry and performances. AB is good as Abhishek but he brings the house down as the effeminate Abbas, he reminds us that he is an amazing actor who has never been completely appreciated.
Ajay Devgan is funny as well, with his mannerisms and his insistence on English expressions such as Honesty is the best mutual policy', `A brother in need is a sister indeed', `Necessity is the mother of Discovery Channel', ha-ha.
Rohit Shetty defies logic with this film and that is the point, this movie was meant to make you laugh and it succeeds.
The movie has amazing cinematography and color; it is a combination of beautiful landscapes and vibrant color. The music is ok but has an outstanding track in the form of Chalaon Na Nainon Se....I enjoyed it even though it is illogical and loud but that was the point and I think most of us would get  that...four stars. 1/11/2013",1357948800,2,2441,4.6720930232558135
