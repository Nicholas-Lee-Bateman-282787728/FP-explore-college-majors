6061660,5,B00G6IOZ2E,"This is the next set in the collection for Megaforce.  In this set the rangers meet an ally but he does not know the difference between good and evil at first, he has to re-learn it.  He makes a great addition to their power team and is a great ally that they need to keep battling evil and ensure victory over all evil villains. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Power Rangers, collects the seasons and likes Megaforce.",1402704000,,429,4.35
6061661,5,B00G6IOZ2E,"All of the Power Ranger books/movies/etc., are for my grandson who ADORES Super Heroes.  I think the appeal here is the fact that these teens use LEARNED SKILLS rather than super powers...who knows?",1401321600,2,198,5.0

8621061,5,B00G6IOZ2E,"Of the three volumes of Power Rangers Megaforce I purchased, this one is my favorite.  I love everything about it, the enemies, the character revealing in ""Harmony and Dizcord"", the one-on-one of Troy against Creepox, and the introduction of Robo Knight who's a genuine badboy.  Too bad that at this point he doesn't know friend from foe.  I loved the part where Emma used her singing voice to counteract Dizcord's music.  Even better is that I got a free red ranger lego figure to add to my collection (I even have a good sword for him as well!).",1448496000,,547,4.551020408163265
