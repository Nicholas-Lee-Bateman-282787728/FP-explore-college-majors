8304211,2,B001G6QZRE,"I mistakenly thought they would go through the country side of the Philipines, like a travel show and feature all the local foods of each region.  I don't particularly like to ""watch"" a cooking show in a studio so my mistake.",1393804800,,225,4.487804878048781
8304212,4,B001G6QZRE,"I got this DVD after seeing an advertisement for it on youtube as I was looking for recipes to cook for my Filipino boyfriend. After finding it here on amazon I ordered it. The videos & recipes look good. The recipes play one after the other. Just wish there was a menue screen so that you could choose a recipe to go straight to. I haven't actually cook any of the recipes yet, but they look simple enough that I feel confident that /i could make them.",1365984000,2,453,4.218390804597701
8304213,4,B001G6QZRE,"I'm building up my cooking collection and saw this video. It's a funky, low-budget production but still covers the basics well enough and was ""approved"" by my Filipina friends :)",1355961600,,178,4.966666666666667
8304214,4,B001G6QZRE,Married my wife 2001 from Cebu City we have been sharing our love of cooking always love to surprise with something new.  Great job on the DVD but could have done a better job on indexing each of the recipes.  That way we can go back again.  Would have also been nice to add recipes cards so we know what to get at the store.  When are the next volumes coming out?,1336348800,2,364,4.013888888888889
8304215,5,B001G6QZRE,"The recipes chosen for the demonstrations are some of the best Filipino dishes that can be served for everyday meals or special occasions.  The chefs/cooks who presented them did so in a simple and clear manner, inspiring and giving viewers the confidence to prepare the dishes in their own kitchens.",1310083200,2,300,5.0
8304216,5,B001G6QZRE,"I found the ""Best of Filipino Food Vol. 1"" was an excellent introduction to cooking Filipino Food. It reminded me of my favorite Filipino dishes that my Mother, Father, aunts and uncles cooked during my childhood.

Unfortunately, the DVD did not include a recipe booklet. So I had to pause the video to write down the ingredients list then write down the cooking instructions as I watched the video, but the resulting dishes always turned out great.

I'm really hoping there is a ""Best of Filipino Food Vol. 2"" coming out soon!

8304217,5,B001G6QZRE,"i was born in the philippines and grew up in the usa with my family and friends who were all phenomenal cooks... the quality of these recipes and their presentation makes this dvd one of my all time Top Ten DVDs. i love everyone's accents as well. :) this makes me feel like i'm sitting just a few feet away from them, learning just as i did when i was little. :)

you get a great variety of regional dishes and an intimate look at the contents of a typical filipino pantry.  i love all the recipes and have noticed the small differences in how each family prepares each dish. for example, the chicken adobo dish is our national dish.. but one of my grandmas (lola) liked hers with lots of sauce/gravy (sabaw) while the other lola liked hers more dry with the sauce being reduced all the way to almost nothing but with all the flavor going into the chicken.

this is a great dvd but know that you can feel free to tweak your own creations to taste. :) have fun making these recipes your own! :)",1252800000,4,994,4.248677248677248
8304218,5,B001G6QZRE,"As a first generation Filipina-American, this is a wonderful dvd.  This dvd makes you feel like you are cooking with your Lola/Tita (Grandmother or Aunt).  Cookbooks are good but it is even better to actually see the dishes being prepared. I anxiously await the next volume!",1240876800,5,274,4.934782608695652
