8331622,3,B001OW0R1U,"if you can ignore the unfunny jokes, if you can bear the frequent loud buzzing sounds and if you can eliminate the frequent distortions in the voice, yes, this could be a helpful supplement to the great book "" Secrets to Drawing Realistic Faces"".
On the 2 DVDs you draw a face from the very beginning with lots of guidelines from Carrie Parks.
Without the book i would be lost, especially when the drawing tools/ techniques - rather principles- are explained.
The introduction to shading is short and shallow - i wish it was explained and demonstrated more thoroughly - otherwise a good intro for beginners.
Indeed the recording is old and has its many flaws as mentioned above.
Running time is 105 minutes and 97 minutes!

Although highly overpriced, for people who cannot learn from books only, this is a must.",1268611200,4,812,4.71830985915493
8331623,5,B001OW0R1U,"This DVD was created a number of years ago, yet the techniques are timeless. It is a compliment to Secrets to Drawing Realistic Faces book rather than competing against it. Four hours of step-by-step instruction that you can stop, back up, and play over again.",1244851200,5,260,4.8
