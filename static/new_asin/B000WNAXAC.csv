I couldn't stop playing Headed for a Heartbreak the piano was so beautiful and I am a Piano girl. I bought this thinking it would be like back in the day but I think Kip fell short here. I am happy to add it to my Concert collection but had I listened to it 1st doubt I would have. I am not saying that based on the looks of the band changed but the sound of the band changed. I think Kip should rock it when he can I would go see Winger as they still perform. I think he should get a steady gig on Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp as he is so good at being a Coach. I will always love you Kip:)",1348099200,,765,3.6707317073170733
