5408600,3,B00AB4I8CM,"Three girls rob a bank and take school mate Cassie (Abbie Cobb) as a hostage. The Redbox description tells you why which was a bigger spoiler than the opening scene which takes place 15 minutes into the film. Two of the girls Abbie (Cassi Thomson) and Grace (Davida Williams) are friends with Cassie while the third girl Marie (Augie Duke) supplies us with internal conflict.

Cassie's mom Joyce (Maeve Quinlan) doesn't trust the FBI investigating the case and ventures out on her own to save her daughter. Maeve Quinlan is the perennial TV mom who reminded he way too much of the made for TV movie mom. Rosa Blasi plays the overly stiff FBI investigator armed with slo-mo swagger music and a set of 38s.

The main actors were acceptable, but the support cast was simply bad. The made for TV script was bland heighten by moments of mock drama. A film for the younger generation.

5408601,5,B00AB4I8CM,"Thank you. Yes thank you actors, director Doug Campbell and everyone else who was involved in creating this solid piece of film-making. This is a film you may typically skip over when looking for the big blockbusters, but don't. I actually almost did the aforementioned, but do to my interest in ""heist"" films, committed the title to memory from Red Box, then scanned Amazon for further info on the film. And, thanks to the previous 2 (yes two) reviewers (who have great taste), I was nudged into renting it and will now buy it on Amazon.

I'm pretty sure this was a direct to home video film from MCI but it plays as good as any high end Hollywood film. I can tell you that this film is not so much about plotting and planning a bank robbery, but more about the dynamics that reveal themselves in between. The acting is top notch for this kind of budget restricted film, and I can be one tough critic. These are some ""giving it all you've got"" portrayals that deserve recognition. I was on the seat of my pants waiting for the next twist or latent clue to come that eventually did and never failed to satisfy.

""Teenage Bank Heist"" has some real actors in it that spout their lines with an incredibly realistic delivery. Almost nothing screamed ""fake"" to me and the little that did was based in pure sentimentality that works for films anyway. The camera shots were absolutely superb with limited but highly plausible action sequences. I would love to have seen extras on the dvd with interviews or behind the scenes footage but I don't even know if the film-makers knew how good a film they made. Plus, this was probably a package deal that had limitations with its distributing.
 This goes beyond just renting, its a keeper. I hope it catches on.

The players:

Maeve Quinlan: Joyce (Cassie's mom played with authentic determination)
Abbie Cobb: Cassie (carries the film with bewilderment and empathy)
Cassie Thompson: Abbie (knows how a gutsy thinking girl acts)
Augie Duke: Maria (rage, spot on, period)
Davida Williams: Grace (a  quiet loss projected)
James Ferris: Nick (has the unstable bad a$* role cornered)
Rosa Blasi: Agent Mendoza (this is the FBI- a talented to the core portrayal with sugar on top)
The ""secondary"" cast members more than held their own as well. And yes I know the two female leads Cassie and Abbie must have switched their real names with each other for their characters names- cool.",1364601600,2,2415,4.683962264150943
5408602,5,B00AB4I8CM,"Like the other reviewer put it, teenage bank heist is a gem. its well written with a believable story and has some fairly decent acting considering it feels almost like a made for lifetime t.v. movie. teenage bank heist is one of the best straight to dvd releases ive seen this year so far and so glad i purchased it:)",1364169600,4,318,4.316666666666666
5408603,5,B00AB4I8CM,"Yeah, I know: Why would you watch a movie with such a cheesy title? That's what I thought! I rented it out of boredom, and guess what: THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!

Seriously! It reminded me of Spielberg's 1st movie ""Duel"". This flick here had me and my wife nail-biting throughout the whole time.

There are plenty of good story twists, nail-biting suspense and intelligent dialogue that will keep you entertaint the whole time. The actors are great, considering that this isn't a blockbuster movie.

I would also consider this a ""clean"" movie that you can watch with your teens. Once or twice you'll hear the ""b-word"", and about as often they mention that are ""scre.."". That's it! (Sorry: No nudity, blasphemy etc.)

Go grab your popcorn and enjoy the ride!",1361836800,5,750,4.790697674418604

8549667,4,B00AB4I8CM,"Cassie, 17, works as a teller at the bank where her mother, Joyce, is the branch manager. When the bank is robbed, Cassie is taken hostage. She soon finds out that the bank robbers are teenage girls, one of whom is her best friend, Abbie.

In this propulsive real-time, ticking clock thriller, as the girls are on the run from the police, we learn that the real motivation behind the robbery was not greed but to raise ransom for Abbie's kidnapped father.",1391644800,,455,4.548780487804878
8549668,3,B00AB4I8CM,"One morning three masked bandits storm the Palm Vista Bank. They steal a cool million, shoot an armored truck guard, and take hostage a 17-year-old bank teller (Abbie Cobb). When the kidnapped girl's mom (Maeve Quinlan) - who happens to be the bank's branch manager - learns that the FBI suspects her daughter as an ""insider"" participant in the robbery, she goes about rescuing her on her own. The movie's biggest W.T.F. twist surfaces when the abducted teen finds out that one of the bank robbers is her rich best friend Abbie (Cassi Thomson). Would it surprise you to know that, really, the main protagonist isn't the kidnapped girl or her mom?

TEENAGE BANK HEIST premiered on Lifetime in 2012 and, going by its title, may fool folks into thinking it's a teen comedy. But, no, it's a straight-up modest thriller and worth watching if you catch it on the telly. But if you expect the movie to regale you with the planning of the heist and the recruiting of the crew, well, those aren't covered. Instead we see the fall-out to the robbery and the very interesting character dynamics and tensions that emerge along the way.

It's predominantly a female cast, with the only male actor of note playing that fink of a boyfriend. This is one of them cases in which the core actors turn in good performances (especially Augie Duke) despite the crap script that riddles the narrative with implausibilities and inconsistencies and dumb choices made by the characters. Maeve Quinlan is believable as the panicked mom, except her actions become so aggravating that she flirts with being arrested for hindering the investigation. And then there's the FBI's Special Agent Mendoza (Rosa Blasi) whose showdown with the big bads is textbook on how NOT to deal with kidnappers. Common sense protocol: when doing a stake-out of a potential meet between crooks, lower the volume on your walkie-talkie.

Lastly, I hope they get rid of those two corpses at the house. Else, their end deception isn't going to fly.

Catch it if you get a chance. It's a flawed but decent heist film.",1376697600,4,2062,4.8
8549669,2,B00AB4I8CM,"I liked the movie a lot until I saw the endding, and thought it was very unrealistic. I really don't like it, if the movie FORCES a good ending somehow. I saw this done before in other movies, and they had to do it in this movie too. Too bad, it was such a good movie too.

Don't get me wrong, I do like good ending as much as everyone else; I just hate it, when they can't do it right! There was just no way that it could had happened like that for the ending. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but I will say at the end, the acting wasn't good. The writing was unrealistic. The directing was up in the air and anything goes now.

This movie could had been a 4 or even a 5 stars, but when the ending came out, I give it 2 stars. Anyone that watches this movie will like it, but towards the very end, watch how the ending was forced upon. Watch the acting closely. Watch how everything that was wrong before, now suddenly, becomes right in a few moments. I won't recommend this movie, unless you just want to watch how it all falls apart at the end.",1373068800,,1055,3.995260663507109

The robbers take the daughter hostage.  Turns out that the robbers are girls from school.  One of the gals dad has been kidnapped, so the girls rob the bank for ransom $.

Soon the mom and FBI are on the hunt.  When one of the gals turns on the rest for all the $ and the kidnappers learn that there is more $, they want all of it.  Then things get ugly. The whole time I'm wondering if the kidnappers are good kidnappers and will actually return the dad.

No skin. Engaging, girl power. It is sometimes unpleasant to watch females be mean.",1368230400,,670,4.1796875
