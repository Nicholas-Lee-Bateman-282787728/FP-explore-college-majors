8123567,5,B000FJH51S,Zombie fans will love this anthology of several different zombie shorts. Hosted by the always sexy Debbon Rochon.,1525651200,,113,5.333333333333333
8123568,2,B000FJH51S,The reviewer above accurately sums up the craziness of the so call continuity links between the stories.  There is less nudity than in Bloodlust but the same cheapness about the segments.  The zombies are done to death (figuratively speaking!) and so are comical rather than scary.  The reason I am giving this two stars is only for one segment with the videotape showing the immediate future of it's victims.  I think it particularly cranked up the atmosphere nicely when the husband is watching his room on the tele and then switches neatly to his own room before his vengeful zombie wife comes for him!!,1158192000,3,606,4.798076923076923
8123569,1,B000FJH51S,"This film features the same bit of film as Red Lips: Bloodlust!

Maria Ortiz and Debbie Rochon meet in a very quiet bar and get to talking about vampires and how sexy they are. In Red Lips: Bloodlust this talk is then interspersed with scenes of another vampire bit. Thus you get a film-within-a-film feel, about vampires.

However, they use the exact same footage here, only they inject small films about the Living Dead/Zombies, thus the dialogue of the two women about vampires makes no sense at all.

And some of the zombie films are really short, only a few minutes.

The other film, Red Lips: Bloodlust, is also known as Red Lips II, and follows from the vampire themed first film. Thus this film about zombies, has no sequel number because it's not really able to fit in anywhere... the only connection being that same footage mentioned earlier.

Thus the cheap price for this film, and the mixed-up nature of it allows me to give it only 1 star",1154131200,2,952,4.576470588235294
