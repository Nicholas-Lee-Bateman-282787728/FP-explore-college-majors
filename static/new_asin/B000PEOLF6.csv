2817569,4,B000PEOLF6,"My husband and I do the George Foreman walk dvd's five nights a week and have purchased several of them to give us a little variety.  I really love this one (although it's my husband least favorite).  It's not a really intense workout--nothing that makes your muscles work really hard like the Circuit Walk or Walk and Box dvd's.  It's a fun and easy workout to do on a night when you're too tired to do one of the more taxing ones and because it's easy and fun I like to do it on those nights when I don't even feel like working out.  There are a few footwork sequences that are a little more challenging than some of the GF walk dvd's--the grapevine and the box step--and I think that is why I like this one and my husband doesn't.  Although it takes a little practice to do some of these steps, it is really fun once you learn them and they aren't all that difficult.",1185408000,16,870,4.18562874251497
8190912,5,B000PEOLF6,"I have one other of George's dvds and really like it.  This one might even be better - definitely more like dancing but the other was listed as walk and box, so more ""work out"" type moves.  Both are good workouts.",1524960000,,213,4.170731707317073

8190916,3,B000PEOLF6,"I bought this DVD to complete my Foreman ""Walk and Box"" collection (there are 8 in all), but it doesn't quite stack up to some of the other titles in the series.  This leans a little more towards dance moves and footwork and, at times, is a little hard to follow as some moves aren't explained beforehand and we don't always get a good look at the instructor's feet.  Also, the last half of this program is a little repetitive as the introductory moves are just repeated and that's it.  I've admittedly only done this one a few times (as opposed to ""Express Walk"" and ""Champion Walk and Sweat"", which are probably my favorites), but I don't really feel like I'm getting an effective workout.  Check it out if you're looking for more of a ""dance party"" atmosphere to your aerobics, but most Foreman fans should start with another title in the series.",1365552000,,849,4.529411764705882
8190917,5,B000PEOLF6,It is like going to a dance party. So much fun. You get two for one because you have fun and get a good work out also. George Forman's funny quips keeps you laughing.,1361750400,,166,3.911764705882353
8190918,5,B000PEOLF6,"I found myself smiling all the way through this video.  Could George Foreman be any more adorable?  I also love Petra, she is so upbeat and friendly and easy to follow!

This felt like Zumba only much less confusing.  Great for those like me who have two left feet and want the benefit of aerobic dance but are unable to dance and have trouble following.

The length of the video was just right for me - I didn't feel dead afterward or like I was going to die during the workout.  It kept my energy up without killing me and I found myself looking forward to the next time!",1360800000,2,573,4.2110091743119265
8190919,5,B000PEOLF6,"Easy to do, enjoy the work out, and easy on the joints. Would recommend buying all of Forman's DVD. Well worth the price.",1357776000,,121,4.304347826086956
8190920,4,B000PEOLF6,Kind of a less intense workout than I prefer but it's wonderful for days when you're tired or sore and just need something light.  I enjoy working out with George and his gang and the directions are always simple and easy peasy to follow.,1313280000,3,238,4.409090909090909
8190921,5,B000PEOLF6,"I love this DVD, it has a different kind of music to workout with. It makes you want to use this workout every day. Its a little faster pace (which I love!) If you like upbeat music while you workout, this one is for you. Petra is fabulous! She keeps everybody moving.",1287619200,,268,4.173076923076923
