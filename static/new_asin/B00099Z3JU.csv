8058539,2,B00099Z3JU,"The quality of the prints, most certainly taken from 16mm and blown up for DVD mastering, is terrible on both films in this AMC release.  Since these features (""The Greeks Had A Word For Them"" and ""Eternally Yours"") are in the public domain, it shouldn't be a surprise.  Yet I had hoped that AMC would not lend it's name to such a cheap and shoddy product.

Apparently I was wrong. Save your money.  Wait until these titles appear in your local dollar store and buy them then.",1231113600,3,476,4.436781609195402
