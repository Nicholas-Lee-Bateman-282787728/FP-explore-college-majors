6425277,5,B00KGIIF9E,"This DVD is outstanding!  3 hours of gold! There is so much detailed information to clearly show each of the very many exercises.  In addition, Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming provides extensive, important, helpful and very interesting theory on the nature of chi and how it is moved through the body, restored and released to best balance the body's health.  The stretches are all helpful for all parts of the body, and valuable for people of all ages. The exercises are all ones that can be performed easily by most people, and the discussion regarding the meridians and detailed instructions and techniques offered for working with many key acupoints is great!  Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming has the ability to clearly explain this complex subject matter in a way that everyone can understand...and enjoy!",1411516800,8,788,5.038461538461538
6425278,5,B00KGIIF9E,"Very powerful video! This DVD combines Qigong, Yoga and Acupressure exercises and is easy to follow along with a Skill Level of 1 and can be done laying down. The first part is of Dr. Yang explaining the theory of Qigong and Yoga. He draws illustrations and diagrams on a white board to help the student better understand how Qigong works. The second part of the video he shows how to do each exercise and the pace is slow enough to keep up with him. He explains what each exercise is for and how beneficial each is exercise is for different parts of the body. He then goes on to explain and demonstrate acupressure, acupoints, meridians and techniques. I followed along with every exercise and was happy with how I felt afterwards. I am going to add this routine to my morning wake up stretches.

6425279,5,B00KGIIF9E,"What could be better for a student of Qigong than to have a DVD which combines Qigong, Yoga and Acupressure exercises combined in one outstanding DVD? Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming has accomplished this by having studied and developed a method where the three disciplines are used to energize, loosen and strengthen your body. All this can be done while lying down.

Dr. Yang first explains the Meridian channels of the body and how they are connected to each other. He simplifies the ancient study by Chinese and Japanese in the practices of these three Arts and how they affect the inner body by using these channels to strengthen Qi. Dr. Yang further explains how everything is governed by Qi and why it is so important to have the Meridian channels strengthened and cleared so the Qi can be fully utilized by the body.

The exercises are very simple to perform and easy to learn. Dr. Yang first goes slowly through each exercise and in later chapters performs along with the viewer at a regular pace. Most exercises are done while laying down but could also be done while sitting. He recommends starting during the morning but afternoon or dusk may be more convenient for the student.

Yoga stretches and Acupressure points are demonstrated and taught my Dr. Chang all the while explaining why these are so important to the body. The connection between these techniques are explained in very easy to understand lectures  in the General Concept section (Part 1).  Then inner body channels and Regulating concepts (body, breath, Qi, mind and spirit) along with Qi vessels and meridians are explained the theory of Meridian Qigong and Yoga.

This combination of exercises are somewhat different than the usual Martial Art DVDs and I found it to be very interesting and informative. I would recommend that the explanations and theories in Part one be watched several times in order to fully understand the total concept of this exercise.

Part 2 has Dr. Yang demonstrating and again explaining the exercises and then having the student following along while exercising.

In Part 3, Dr. Yang teaches Self-Massage and Acupressure.

Meridian Qigong is a very interesting and informative program and is so simple to learn and perform. I would highly recommend all students of any discipline to purchase and learn.",1409702400,10,2300,4.953246753246753
6425280,5,B00KGIIF9E,"My main practice has been tai chi and qigong , always standing or sitting. Never in the prone position. This lying down routine is a perfect addition to my daily practice.

Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming spends a great deal of time in thought and process before he issues new material. The background work always shows. His descriptions are clear and precise. It is recommended to view the entire DVD and then go back and practice sections at a time. I viewed it many times so that I could absorb all the little gems of information. He doesn't just lecture, he actually gets down on the table/bed and does each movement so you can follow along in real time. I have practiced tai chi for many years and have always been told that where the mind goes the qi flows. One comment that struck a cord with me was ""The mind is very powerful, it can go back a thousand years and jump forward into the future right away."" That is a powerful notion to take hold of. Focus your mind and the body will follow. Stay present and aware and wonders can happen.

Using this DVD, you learn how to regulate your simple body movements, breath, mind, qi and shen or spirit. I like that Dr. Yang uses common sense to explain what he believes. He tell us that as the human being has been separated from nature over the centuries by such things as clothing and shelter. The more we insulate ourselves, the harder it is to feel and communicate with nature. Is your blood pressure too high? Hug a tree, feel the energy, feel yourself calm and your pressure lower. Are you in pain? Should you take a pain killer? What will it do? It will tell the pain to Shutup, but it does not communicate and find the reason for the pain. Simple stuff.

Yoga comes from India and qigong comes from China. Damo was an Indian who brought Yoga to the Chinese monks to add to their qigong practice. Dr. Yang comes to the West to share these ancient arts in a fashion that is clear and understandable. What could be easier than laying in bed, moving around, breathing and feeling much better after a few minutes? This practice has done wonders for my stiffen joints that have been damaged by chemo treatments. I am able to function much quicker in the morning if I take the time to practice the movements before trying to jump out of bed and race around all day. For those of you who have trouble sleeping at night, breath, move and relax with this wonder set.

As always, the filming and clarity of the DVD is excellent. Dr. Yang speaks English on the DVD with English subtitles for the hearing impaired. You have no excuse not to try this. You don't have to memorize long tai chi forms, stand in meditation or wrap your legs in lotus position to sit . Just relax in your own bed, breath, move and enjoy.",1409184000,40,2748,4.382352941176471
6425281,5,B00KGIIF9E,"I am a Qi Healer and have taught Qigong and Tai Chi for over 20 years.  This DVD does an excellent job at explaining how energy flows through the body and the meridians.  It teaches, step by step, a stretching program that can be done lying down to improve your health and deeply relax the body.

If you did this program before bed, you would deepen your sleep.  If you did it before getting out of bed in the morning, you would decrease stiffness and enhance your sense of well-being throughout the day. If you have previously found yoga to be too hard or uncomfortable, then this DVD is the answer.  By combining Qigong and Yoga into a lying-down set, Dr. Yang has made a great contribution to the healing arts.

An exceptional added bonus- Dr. Yang teaches an entire self-massage routine using acupressure on specific meridian points!  The depth of knowledge he has offered on this DVD is profound and well worth adding to your library.",1409184000,66,939,4.586826347305389

6425284,5,B00KGIIF9E,"This is the best exercise video I've found.  I have post-polio and back and hip problems, but I can do most of the exercises and have gotten a huge benefit in terms of reduced pain and an ability to walk and move better, along with increased energy during the day.  I need to modify some of the exercises, but as time goes on (I've been doing the exercises for three months now)  I am becoming stronger and more flexible, so less modification is needed.  I recommend this DVD to anyone regardless of the limitations you are dealing with.  Thank you, Dr. Yang!",1436918400,21,559,4.4411764705882355
6425285,4,B00KGIIF9E,"Meridian Qigong is a very nice companion to any internal arts practice! I have been a practitioner of the Internal Arts over 20 years and also have a set of exercises/qigong that I do laying down. I find that it is a critical training which can allow the body to relax enough so that you can start to feel the soft tissues, which allows one to go deeper into the body/mind to gain a deeper sense of feeling in ones training. Though relaxation is not taught specifically in this DVD, these exercises are a great start to softening ones practice and to get in touch with your Qi.",1430438400,7,577,4.351851851851852

6425289,5,B00KGIIF9E,"These exercises are so easy you don't even have to get out of bed to do them. In fact, Dr. Yang designed these exercises for your bed!

The Meridian Qigong  Combined Qigong, Yoga & Acupressure (YMAA) by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming three-hour DVD features mostly 38 exercises. Dr. Yang combined these exercises from qigong movements, yoga stretches, and acupressure techniques.

In one section, he both explains the theory behind the exercises and demonstrates the move. Then, he does another section in which you follow along with him.

Its perfect for the DVD player in your bedroom. Just pop this sucker in, and you're good to go.

Dr. Yang also provides a great overview of general concepts  including qigong, the five regulatings, the network of qi vessels and meridians, and the theory behind 12-meridian qigong and yoga.

YMAA lists this at an intermediate skill level, but I believe Dr. Yang provides enough information here even for beginners. I certainly don't pretend to have any expertise in qigong, and this DVD was helpful in explaining some concepts that have been otherwise fuzzy to me.",1417564800,5,1094,5.011049723756906

8658427,3,B00KGIIF9E,"I thought I was going to love this video but it kinda gets a little weird in places.  First off you exercise on your bed.  That means you have to have a bed big enough to roll back and forth and still be comfortable watching and following along with this video.  The beginning is good and I think the exercises are helpful but later in the video he has you touching some places you wouldn't normally touch and he demonstrates those exercises himself in the video.  That's where it seemed a little weird to me.  My guess is our culture is different so what may seem common place to him is a little out there for us.  None the less, I recommend it for the benefits of the exercises that are in it in the beginning at least.",1444780800,5,721,4.188405797101449
8658428,4,B00KGIIF9E,"The information contained on DVD is very good, however I did find that the files are encrypted.  While this is not an issue for the exposition of qigong, it is for the practice which is mostly shown in bed.  It would be very helpful to be able to place that file on a tablet or such which is easier to use than a desk top computer or even a laptop big enough for a DVD drive.",1442016000,7,375,3.9210526315789473
