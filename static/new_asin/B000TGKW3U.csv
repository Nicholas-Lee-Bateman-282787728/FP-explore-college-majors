8209123,2,B000TGKW3U,"I do agree Bunuel if indeed he thought that
""Woman Without Love"" was the worst movie he ever made.

A woman marries an older man for his money in an explicit deal with him. He keeps his part of the deal by providing her with a comfortable home, and as it happens he is a likable, warm man. She rewards him by having an affair with an engineer that passes through the town. It;s beyond me why the movie lavishes compassion on this gold-digging frigid slut rather than on her patient, decent, betrayed husband.",1377302400,,508,4.404255319148936
8209124,5,B000TGKW3U,"Senor Luis was truly one of the world's greatest directors and, once
again he proved his genius in this greatly moving drama (based on a
Maupassant story); and with the help of his very competent, talented
actors, Bunuel had created another masterpiece. Recommended!",1296518400,,266,5.209302325581396
8209125,4,B000TGKW3U,"Luis Buuel thought that ""Woman Without Love"" was the worst movie he ever made and he wrote about it in his autobiography, ""I'd been told to set up a screen on the set and just copy Andr Cayatte's movie (1943 film version of Guy de Maupassant's Pierre et Jean) scene by scene. Not surprisingly, I made it my own way, but it was still a disaster"". I don't agree with him. I believe that he never made a bad film - he simply could not. Even if it lacks in his trademark surrealism, it still has his intelligence, his craft, and the ability to make a rather forgettable melodrama interesting and insightful. I am sure many directors would be proud of Woman Without Love. With changing the title of the movie and Maupassant's novella from Pierre et Jean to Woman Without Love, Buuel, focuses on one of his favorite subjects - couple in love longing for each other and their inability to fulfill their desire due to all types of obstacles, social and religious.  is evidently present in the film and elevates it above countless soap-operas. The film is above countless soap-operas. It is beautiful; it moves well, it is based on the writings by a talented writer. I like the acting, and the finale was not disappointing. ""A woman without Love"" may not be the best Luis Buuel's film but as his devoted fan, I could not skip it and I am glad that I saw it.

P.S. The quality of DVD leaves a lot to desire.",1214611200,3,1397,4.410852713178294

there is a mistake in the names list of the artists.
On this film there is no participation of Pedro Armendariz, Columba Dominguez and Dolores del Ro. They made ""La Malquerida"".
The true artists were Tito Junco and Rosario Granados. Director: L. Buuel",1191628800,6,319,4.517241379310345
