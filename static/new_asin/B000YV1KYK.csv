Dr. Douillard speaks knowledgably about the principals and practices in Ayurveda and I was surprised that there was information he refuted about our modern 'dieting' patterns, first being that you should graze all day.

3036418,5,B000YV1KYK,"I discovered Ayurveda a few years ago and I have gotten very interested in it.  Unfortunately, there are not many good DVD's on the subject, but this one by the wonderful GAIAM company is informative and produced for the beginners (like me).

No long winded boring stories about Ayurveda, but rather, something that is aimed at people who want to start at the beginning to improve their lives with Ayurveda.

3036424,5,B000YV1KYK,"I've been looking into Dr. Douillard quite a bit lately after trying his Colorado Cleanse this last spring.  A friend lent me this DVD because I've been looking more towards medicinal nutrition, quick and easy morning yoga, and a plan I can stick with during my crazy busy school days.  I LOVE this DVD. It offers a basic intro to Ayurvedic concepts like your dosha (vata, pitta or kapha) and how to eat throughout the day as well as throughout the year.  Dr. John Douillard delivers his plan through a sort of informal sitting with a patient as kind of an interview process.  Dr. Douillard debunks the 'eat-six-meals-a-day' hype that's been out there and explains why.  Finally, you can go to the 'Action Plan' portion of the DVD. Here, Dr. Douillard teaches meditation and breathing exercises to calm the nervous systema and does yoga with his darling daughter!  If the DVD isn't enough for you, it comes with a small booklet (in which there is a quiz to determine your dosha).  You can also figure out your dosha on his website: [...].  I'm not at all a morning person, but I have been doing his easy 15 minute yoga routine all this last week and I feel great.  It doesn't take much--no running, huffing and puffing--to get going in the morning.  Just some simple poses to stimulate the body and its natural ability to burn fat.  This DVD is a great resource, especially as a companion to ""The Yoga Body Diet,"" which I picked up locally after I borrowed the DVD.",1307664000,12,1465,4.574712643678161

Dr. Douillard takes his time to make sure his audience understands the basics of good nutrition and nutrition that moves with the seasons. He moves from the general explanation of Ayurveda for health into mini video lessons on how to breath, meditate, improve personal eating habits and some cool yoga moves.

If you're looking for something a little different, this could be a great video for you.",1260921600,15,598,4.740384615384615
3036427,5,B000YV1KYK,"I really enjoyed this dvd and thought it had a lot to offer as a very doable introduction that gets you going on the 51% plan.  The concept of the 51% is you do not have to be perfect when you start something but if you can implment something 51% of the time then you are doing it the majority of the time.  So he says start with eating 51% of the the grocery lists for each season 51% of the time and work from there.  As you get comfortable with that you start working on the phases of the diet.  You start eating in season, then you start with three meals with no snacks.  You adjust the amount of the meals so you are full and you do not shock your body into storing fat.  When you are comfortable eating three meals you focus on lunch being biggest and making dinner smaller.  Then you focus on eating dinner before 6:00 p.m.  When you can do all of this easily you move into final stage where you skip dinner gradually and only drink herbal tea with honey and work up to 3 skipped dinners a week towards  the 100% which would be 3 to four weeks with no dinner so you are burning fat from lunch till breakfast.  He then gives you a daily routine to help.  The action plan talks about using a body brush or gloves to remove dead skin followed by an oil massage.  He shows you how to do this quickly or take longer if you have the time.  Then he has 11 minute meditation that is really nice and he does five minutes of alternate nostril breathing.  The nicest thing was an unexpected 15 minute yoga routine that he does with his teenage daughter that I really enjoyed and could easily see me adding to my daily yoga routine.  He said to do this routine in the morning but I think it would be really good to do at night as well. He also had a wonderful tutorial on how to breath when doing cardio that I have never seen before and felt great when I tried it.  Lots of good information, very high production and thought I would mention that an added bonus is the good doc is pretty easy on the eyes as well :-).",1235174400,57,2012,4.094387755102041

As it turns out, it is not in the Amazon description and it is not pictured in the ad.  The information in the booklet is also in Douillard's book so you'll have to get it there.

I like it, especially the action plan items he includes such as how to do the massage, meditation, yoga, etc. Unfortunately, this shipped from Amazon (sealed and brand new) without the DVD case booklet he mentions in the DVD.

He mentions on the DVD that the booklet contains the dosha type quiz and the seasonal shopping lists, so I feel like I was not given the entire product as promised.
