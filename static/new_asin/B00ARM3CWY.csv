5494866,5,B00ARM3CWY,"This is truly the saddest story I've ever watched ever!  In the beginning, she was under the assumption that she was becoming a mother legally.  Then, it was either lie, or lose her child.  Just heart-breaking!  Even though she was not his biological mother, she had the love of a mother.  A mother's love is so powerful it cannot be expressed in words.  It is something only a person who becomes a mother can begin to understand.  I pray for this family and for Marco. I so wish they'd been able to keep him.",1346025600,,509,4.351063829787234
5494867,5,B00ARM3CWY,"Honestly, this story must be embellished but I really don't care. My wife and I got into watching Locked Up Abroad every week and this one is probably my favorite of all time! Who cares how much of the details are really true. We know the basics are true. The story is awesome. Erik does an excellent job of retelling and acting in the reenactment! Love it!",1345766400,,357,4.343283582089552
5494868,5,B00ARM3CWY,"Not your typical episode. This is one of the better ones ive seen and I definitely got my money's worth.

No doubt America did the world a service in 2003 when Uday was killed, a brutal and evil man",1341792000,,198,4.076923076923077
5494869,1,B00ARM3CWY,"It's expected that any show doing a reenactment of a true event is going to exaggerate or fabric a little bit of the story to make it more dramatic and entertaining.  However, this episode is something out of a Hollywood fiction script.  The main character is total tool and supposedly says that he beat up handfuls of angry prisoners all by himself.  As the story progressed it became obvious that Eric was wildly exaggerating the events at best, and most likely just flat out lying.  Locked up abroad has lost all credibility and I know the producers can't be that stupid to believe this crap.  Eric is a Hollywood actor trying to make it in the business.  It is obvious that he lied about his story to make himself look like a real life Terminator, in a sad attempt to gain some publicity.",1341187200,8,792,4.503496503496503
5494870,1,B00ARM3CWY,"I've watched every episode of locked up abroad seasons 1-5, this new season is very disappointing so far.  In this episode, although the story was well told, the man was locked up abroad for 1 day.....seriously he was locked up for 1 day and then released.  If that's the standards they have for the show, they might as well go down to TJ, Mexico and make episodes from the 20 Americans that get arrested on any given weekend for drunken disorderly.",1341187200,,449,4.530864197530864
5494871,5,B00ARM3CWY,"I must say all the three previous reviews I've read about this episode seem like they came from intelectual know-it-alls that don't appreciate what it means to be a man, and how valuable principles are. I could be wrong, but it seems like since they could never imagine themselves acting in such a fashion as the character, that it is truly ""impossible"" that any of this really happened. In my opinion, it's their own sad attempt to make themselves feel good about being weak. This is not a direct attack on any of the reviewers, but rather on the common message that all three previous reviews seemed to reflect: that these reviewers were so upset that this character ""had the audacity"" to be ""John Wayne-like"". Heaven forbid that. Sure, there was an over abundance of ""macho"" throughout this episode, but that was just window dressing, a background, behind a riviting, powerful and inspiring story. Hey, did anybopdy actually pick-up on the inspirational, exhilirating  nature of this message? Or were they just too busy trying to nit-pick and knock-down any scene in which the character displayed inner strenghth and character? Judging from the three previous poor reviews - and NO positive reviews so far, I don't know what's happened to most Americans in the last 10 years. The trend seems to be that we all want to apoligize for, and indeed- by ""horified"" at, even the slightest bit of masculinity. I've come to the conclusion that we have a majority in our nation that are truly over-educated and taught to go along to get along, rather than to stand up for what's right - no matter what happens. Most Americans are not taught, and therefore have no idea, about the ammount ""masculinity"" and ""John Wayne-ish-ness"" that it truly took to create and sustain what has now become America. As evidence from the other previous reviews shows, America no longer celebrates fighting for truth, and fighting for principles above all else; but instead, we have become a weak, arogant, misled society filled with educated idiots who delight in throwing sissy fits about anything that hints of being ""macho"" .... and that leads me to believe that all of America's enimies (and believe me - MOST of the world are enimies of America), are salivating at how feeble as a nation we have become. I apologize if this review was more or less a review of the other previous reviews... and I mean no disrespect to any of the reviewers... but in a way... I hope that brings out how valuable and inspiring this episode was to me. Indeed... I will hereby proclaim: It IS okay to ""be a man"" and ""stand up for what's right"". If we are going to err, I'd rather err on the side of ""too much macho"" rather than ""not enough macho"". To hell with over-educated political correctness and jealous knock-down artists. BRING ON THE MACHO:-)",1340409600,2,2808,4.754098360655738
5494872,1,B00ARM3CWY,"Oy vay,

I don't even know where to begin with this episode.  I love the LUA series.  It has great cinematography, music, etc.  This episode is the only one that made me want to hurl.  This guy (who plays himself in the episode btw.)comes across as a total tool.  I don't believe anything about this story other than that he was locked up in Pakistan.  Apparently, he is taking the ""Frank Dux"" approach to story telling (the guy they based blood sport on and was later determined to be a total fraud).  Who knows? maybe he was somebody's woman in the jail or he was indeed the Alpha male.  Hard to believe the Chuck Norris/Steven Segal/ Jean Claude Van Damme overtones throughout.  I call BS.  Really surprised this episode was made.  At the LUA website, they ask you to submit a story that will be ""Independently verified""--I'd really like to know how this was accomplished in this episode.  As someone with experience in the fight business (I am a full time boxing coach), I can say without a doubt that the maxim of ""12 mangy dogs can take down a lion""--is in general, the reality.  No doubt that the prisoners would have shanked him instead of the Ninja-kung fu-Hollywood fight scene as was portrayed.  What a load.

Uggh.....I really hope the rest of the season is better.",1336003200,11,1277,4.559471365638767
5494873,1,B00ARM3CWY,"Wow, this Eric Aude guy is like the Terminator, Bruce Willis and Jason Statham all rolled into one.  He doesn't bend under torture, her takes on entire groups of Pakistani prisoners and wins every time, he single-handedly brings down the most corrupt guard in the prison, and prepares himself for his final confrontation with the prison guards like Rocky (seriously, he puts on a hoodie, a beanie, and stuffs tissue in his mouth--looks like six kinds of an idiot).  Oh, and by the way, he is completely innocent and had no idea that he was smuggling drugs (apparently smuggling leather goods is okay); he even refuses to plead guilty for a shorter sentence.

Amazingly he says all of this with a straight face and somehow the cameramen manage to keep filming this load of garbage.  Totally nauseating and not worth the 40 min; it made me never want to watch Locked Up Abroad ever again.",1335657600,22,886,4.696774193548387
5494874,2,B00ARM3CWY,"Generally a fan of this show but there was so many jaw dropping incidents that I just cannot believe that this story is true.

- The embassy in Pakistan sends a woman to a men's jail in Pakistan. I can buy into a lot of missteps and government incompetence but now way would the embassy, well schooled in cultural sensitivity would send a woman as their representative to liaison at an all male jail. And to deliver the news that he would be tortured for 3 days and that they initially wanted 10 days but she negotiated it down to three days? Would love to see someone from the embassy debunk much of this mans story.

 - The Pakistani government negotiates with the US embassy on how many days it is going to torture a U.S. drug runner? No way it works like that. I full on know torture is a fact in a jail like that. I just don't believe that they negotiate about it.

- This guy gets tortured for 3 days, probably has eaten anything the whole time and when he goes to the main jail the next day, he's in Rambo shape to defeat all comers? Right. Torture where you're feet are beaten to a pulp, water boarded and beaten around the body leave a person drained, unable to sit up, feed themselves or anything else and he's fighting like he's a top MMA fighter?

-The only American in the jail and he beats up the most abusive guard in the jail and leaves a hero?

The whole episode raises so many red flags that this is just a partial listing. These kind of blatant inconsistencies make me really question the validity of the entire Locked up abroad series. To make something like this and label it true take a real dose of hubris and lack of respect for an audience.",1335398400,12,1665,4.26984126984127
5494875,3,B00ARM3CWY,"While Erik's experience in a Pakistani prison is compelling, his arrogance in the telling is off-putting. For instance, he related a situation where, while on a run, he tried, unsucessfully, to engage some young Pakistani women in a flirtation. An older man came out and attempted to put a stop to it and Erik 'took him down.' Absolutely no consideration for cultural norms and mores in a country in which he was a barely tolerated guest. Moreover, his so-called 'John Wayne' standard of handling things in the face of all prisoners against little ol' him ('going down with his thumbs up')just sounded like pure Hollywood posturing and made me giggle like I was watching cartoons.  Still, there were moments, like when he called his mommy that I felt his despair. Finally, when he met his mother, as he arrived in the U.S., he looked healthy, albeit a little slim.  There didn't appear to be bruises or scars that were intimated in the narrative. I know to expect some 'poetic license' but, never-the-less, I was a little surprised.  I hope he truly meant what he said about appreciating his life now.  That is a lesson we all have to learn one way or another.

Oh, and as far as having to plead guilty over there to get a lighter sentence...  Sounds kinda of familiar over here!  Just sayin'...  2 1/2 STARS",1335312000,7,1308,4.656521739130435

5494879,1,B00ARM3CWY,"Horrible episode. I lost a lot of respect for NG after watching this show. I wonder how they actually verified Erik's account of this story. I was embarrassed as an American to watch and hear what he said and did. Based on every other episode of this show I have watched, this guy would have been dead. I was waiting for home to pull ninja stars out of his butt or pull a matrix backbend at some point. SMH",1419206400,2,406,4.151898734177215

5494882,1,B00ARM3CWY,"Not Amazon's fault, I'm guessing.  NGC sold this as a dude getting busted in Bali.  I spend time regularly there, and the penalty in Indonesia for trafficking is death.  The subject of the story lived in Bali briefly, but his story took place in Nepal and Japan.  They spent less than two minutes discussing Bali.

8556954,3,B00ARM3CWY,"I watched one episode, which is the first episode of this show I have ever watched. I looked it up after reading ""A House in the Sky"" by Amanda Lidhout. The book was far better. This show felt kind of chopped up and disconnected and lacking what it takes to produce empathy. It seems like they interviewed Nigel and edited that interview to only include the most exciting phrases, which made the story hard to follow, and gave the whole thing an ""out of context"" feel. The constant stream of high points has no power compared to the ups and downs of their true life in captivity.  Think roller coaster; there's no thrill if everything is a high point. I'm definitely not enticed to buy any more episodes.",1453507200,,704,4.5
