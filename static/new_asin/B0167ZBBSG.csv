8735818,5,B0167ZBBSG,"Some of the greatest vintage animation of the early 80's video game era.  If you didn't play QBert in the arcade, you probably won't understand the cartoon quite as much as if you did.  Still a great watch overall from the glory days of Saturday morning cartoons.",1489881600,,263,4.574468085106383
8735819,4,B0167ZBBSG,"Luv that crazy q*bert when I was 8.  Of course, they could've shown the closing credits along with the rest of that Saturday Supercade roster.  Reminds me of porking on Cap'n Crunch while gazing at CBS Saturday morning bumpers.",1462924800,,227,4.794871794871795

8735821,4,B0167ZBBSG,"Would be five stars if there were more episodes, or it were at a lower price point. That said, beggars can't be choosers, and I'm glad that this much has been released. Both the video and sound quality are nice, and my son enjoyed watching it tonight even though he was mostly unfamiliar with the game (we've played it once or twice).",1455840000,2,334,4.403225806451613
8735822,5,B0167ZBBSG,"I've already got my Q*bert DVD. Let's pray for Frogger, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Pitfall, Space Ace, and Kangaroo also on DVD. I sure hope they would include the Saturday Supercade segments to them, like the bumpers, and opening & closing credits for the Special Features on one of them!",1453766400,2,292,4.745098039215686
8735823,5,B0167ZBBSG,"Q*Bert is a great addition to any Saturday Morning Fan's Collection, and includes many story lines similar to those in Pac Man the animated series, though with perhaps more variety in story lines here. Q*Bert's voice is a great choice for this character, and best of all, he is often pursued by his arch rivals from the video game, resulting in fun chases as Q*Bert hops across his environment, on top of cars, objects and more, turning their surfaces to a bright yellow color, as if he was on the game grid. The series includes 2 discs, each about 1 hour and 43 minutes each, and presented by Sony. The picture quality is excellent, and looks remastered with quality sound.
My only complaint is the menu is cut and paste from some Authoring DVD program, and they didn't even bother to put an image of Q*Bert in it. Instead, it's just a stock image from the authoring program that has nothing to do with this series. Almost like they didn't have time to add a simple Jpeg image. Otherwise, really nice collection from the Saturday Supercade of the 80's.",1448841600,6,1053,4.576719576719577
