8325455,3,B000N5Q7HC,"Truly a strange little cinematic hangover. Being a genre completist, I decided to add this to an all-day movie binge. I don't know where to start on this one. Let's go with the opening credits, which -- believe it or not -- are intermittently superimposed over fully five minutes at the start. Fortunately, they distract from a rather dull series of set-up sequences. The film is alternately interesting in a shaggy dog way, and dull. The human interaction footage has the feel of being largely added as padding.

Once the actual film gets underway, it becomes rather uniquely interesting. The premise begins with two decaying bodies being found in a net strung beneath an abandoned salvage ship. The film then backtracks to the initial location of a sunken 19th century ship. Exploring the hulk for potential treasurer, a diver stumbles across a very obviously false skeleton strapped to the deck of a sealed compartment. He, of course, unchains it, then removes the obligatory ""sinister amulet"" that had been hanging from its' neck. When he subsequently puts it on, he becomes an entranced killer.

The payoff is that the fleshless corpse had once been a kidnapped heathen virgin princess, captured and abducted. Is anyone surprised when she promptly fleshes out (with the exception of her head, which is largely concealed throughout by a wooden mask), and uses the bedazzled diver to kill and scalp native girls.

Next, we toss in an affair between one of the salvage operation's partners and his partner's wife, and members go the late princess's cult popping up, and the waters become predictably murkier. Of course a second dive on the sunken ship, with treasure as the object, is called for. It all ends up with deserved comeuppance, in the best Grade D movie traditions. The wicked die, and the princess presumably continues to haunt the depths.

As with many Filipino horror films, there's a smattering of nudity on the part of the resurrected princess...rather interestingly shot underwater, including a fight scene.

Minor stuff, but oddly compelling. It's not quite like anything I've encountered before.",1448150400,,2116,5.068965517241379
8325456,2,B000N5Q7HC,"The Deathhead Virgin (Norman Foster, 1974)

This odd US/Philippines production was meant to be the beginning of Jock Gaynor's mighty film career. Gaynor, a character actor who appeared in some of the sixties' iconic shows (Outlaws, Rawhide, Batman, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, among others), was getting less television work, so he decided to make the jump to the big screen, I guess. He'd appeared in one uncredited role on the big screen back in 1960 (in Mervyn LeRoy's Wake Me When It's Over), why not take that and run with it? To that effect, he co-wrote a script with co-star Larry Ward (who will always be remembered for providing the alien voices of Jabba the Hutt and Greedo in the Star Wars flicks), hired the aged Norman Foster (who was instrumental in bringing both the Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto franchises to the silver screen some forty years previous) to direct, and waited for the cash to roll in. It didn't. Ward, obviously, kept working, but Foster was working on his last film (he would be dead by 1976), and Gaynor's career post-The Deathhead Virgin was limited to a single guest-star appearance on Knight Rider twelve years later.

Plot: Frank Cutter (Ward) finds a sunken ship while diving off the coast of the Philippines. He calls in his playboy pal Larry Alden (Gaynor) to help him recover the treasure on the QT (the Philippine government, it seems, claims half of all treasure found in Philippine waters). By the time Alden gets to the wreck site with his lady-of-the-week, Maria (Iraidaarambulo, who never appeared in another film), something is very wrong with Frank. You see, the ship is guarded by the spirit of a Moro princess (The Twilight People's Kim Ramos) who wants to make sure said treasure stays on the sea floor. And when Frank takes her amulet, she gets kind of mad. We're told all this in flashback from Frank's funeral, as the local authorities relate the tale to his late wife Janice (77 Sunset Strip's Diane McBain).

One of the big problems with those with extensive experience in TV trying to write big-screen scripts is that the resulting movies often come off like extended TV series episodes with more violence and/or nudity than one can get away with on television. That's exactly the case here (the lovely Kim Ramos usually wears nothing but a skull mask when she's onscreen). Foster's best days as a director were long, long behind him, but it's still competent; Foster was working by the numbers, but at least he knows what the numbers are. And you'll see the ending coming from a mile off, maybe from the opening credits, but you have to give Gaynor and Ward credit for at least attempting to throw a twist into the plot, even if it's a failure. It ends up playing out like a not-quite-as-sexy, not-nearly-as-well-acted episode of Wild Wild West--which is not nearly as much of a condemnation as it sounds, actually. That was my favorite show growing up. This won't go down in history as a classic film by any means, but it's not quite as awful as most of what I saw this weekend. **",1291161600,3,3048,4.682835820895522
