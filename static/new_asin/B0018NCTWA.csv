If you have never been exposed to Russian Art, I recommend purchasing these tapes showing the Art of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg which are just incredible to watch! I had no idea until I watched these videos what spectacular art treasures I was missing out on. In college we only studied limited European Art works. The video pictures and sound are of the highest quality. Makes me wish I could go to Russia and see the real thing. The museum itself is a work of art and you will also learn rich Russian Art History.",1283385600,,585,4.425925925925926
