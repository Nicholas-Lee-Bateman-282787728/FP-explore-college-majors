1395704,3,B0000560QE,"Double Suicide is director Masahiro Shinoda's stunning cinematic adaptation of a classic Japanese bunraku puppet drama. The film is striking in its visual look -- puppeteers (or kurago) appear on stage with the actors, as if to assist them in their actions and choices and guide them along to their inescapable fates.
Shinoda's amazing film has never looked better than it does on Criterion's DVD release of the film. If you love the look and feel of a black-and-white movie, your jaw will hit the floor when you feast your eyes on the amazing transfer on this disc.
Unfortunately, there are no extras or supplemental material included - no trailers, commentary, documentaries, or text pages. There is a great essay in the liner notes by film critic Claire Johnston, but I was hoping for more extensive background material on the film. Once one gets spoiled by many of Criterion's other fantastic discs (Brazil, Chasing Amy, Seven Samuari, etc.), it can be hard to accept a DVD that has ""just the movie"".
Nonetheless, the fantastic quality of both the film itself and its gorgeous transfer makes me recommend the disc to movie-lovers everywhere!",984009600,13,1145,4.96875
1395705,5,B0000560QE,"Original story from the Bunraku play by Chikamatsu Monzaemon. This is excellent film directed by Masahiro Shinoda. Crafted in both bold and elegant strokes. Set in traditional Japan, this is the story of a man who becomes infactuated with a prostitue, and his carrier and family life suffer because of it. This comes with my highest recommendation.",972777600,3,348,5.12280701754386

It's a very good film. And the director attempted to think outside the box and do something different. And in my opinion he succeeded.",1488844800,,215,4.684210526315789

Rating = ***
Director:  Masahiro Shinoda
Producers:  Masayuki Nakajima et al.
DVD
1969

Film = barely three (3) stars; subtitles = three (3) stars.  Director Masahiro Shinoda's inventive and dramatic use of a layered presentation technique where a play about making a movie is the movie, sort of.  It is a tale of a philandering husband confronting a mid life crisis during Japan's feudal age (a mashup of the usual shomin-geki [house drama] and jidai-geki [period drama] photoplay genre) culminating in the ""traditional"" lovers' joint murder/suicide .  The clever use of helpful and ever-present ""stage hands"" dressed top-to-toe in black (like those who move things about in the dark between scenes of a stage play) is both menacing and fascinating (they even turn up in the on-location exterior death scenes).  Puppets appear in the opening scenes without explanation and then are gone forever without explanation (there is derivative reason for this, but it is missing from the movie).  An abstract torii (a Shinto shrine archway) is used for assisted suicide (or is it willful execution?) with the help of many stage hands (the Director seems to be editorializing here).  At about mid point, the movie turns seriously boring from the cumulative impact of nonstop, over-the-top acting histrionics, script repetitions, and scenes of talking heads (the film has been overly stretched  and could be cut roughly in half).  Cinematography (narrow screen, black and white) is okay (this antiquated format seems to have been used to appeal to art-house theater patrons of the day).  Restoration is fine.  Score is close to being acoustically invisible.  Subtitles are all but missing from the opening credits.  They also need some judicious re-editing given the screen flash rate and their accuracy (hey, it's not easy to find translators with Kansai-ben skills who will work cheap!).  Mostly a case of art for art's sake.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1449878400,,2018,5.25
7931553,4,B0000560QE,"Double Suicide is a film which I do not completely understand but nonetheless rate up. I rate flat or down many other films I do not understand because they feel hollow or pretentious or have no positive qualities I can appreciate. With Double Suicide, I cannot rate it as average given the very interesting filmmaking and choreography. I expect that with better understanding of Japanese theater and with repeated viewings I would come to better appreciate the film. That said, I find the (intentional) overwrought acting with overdub sound to be grating and give Double Suicide a low four stars.",1443571200,,597,4.98

7931555,5,B0000560QE,"There are no limits for the erotic obsession. This tragic tale about two lovers who live at the edge of the social rules or any oath.

A paper merchant will sacrifice all what he had and was for her, a devoted prostitute. Scorching and absorbing movie that will not leave you indifferent at the end.

Without any doubt, this is Masahiro Shinoda's masterpiece.",1387584000,,359,4.682539682539683
7931556,4,B0000560QE,"The film Double Suicide is based on the 1721 play The Love Suicides at Amijima by Monzaemon Chikamatsu.  It is traditionally and still often performed in the bunraku style, which is with puppets for those unfamiliar with bunraku (which I assume is almost everyone - myself included until I saw this film). It's not one of the more popular Criterion releases (based on frequent availability at my local library and the low number of ratings on this site and on other sites such as IMDB).

>> Do not confuse this with the Japanese New Wave film Japanese Summer: Double Suicide. <<

In this film we see a very classic Japanese (and other cultures as well) story: ill fated lovers destined for a grisly end.  The film begins as a traditional bunraku but quickly morphs into a stunningly filmed Japanese movie with actors substituted for the puppets.  At times we hear a 'narrator' off screen (supposedly the 'director') and we see the use of the black clad 'kuroko' quite often.  They interact in the background and sometimes place objects into the scene for the actors, but they rarely command much attention.  I found that viewing the film once and watching the main actors and paying attention to the plot, followed by a second viewing to watch the kuroko a little more was quite satisfying.

I felt that I would add another positive review to a gorgeously shot and often overlooked Japanese film.  I regret the lack of extras on this release.  Criterion is usually a lot better with the special features, especially for a standard (not Eclipse) release.  I hesitated between four and five stars.  It's such an interesting and unique film so I highly recommend this for fans of Japanese film.  But with the lack of special features, and this film compared to some other amazing Japanese films of this era (such as the stately and traditional films of Ozu) this doesn't quite warrant five stars.

Film - 4.5 stars
Extras - zero star",1348876800,2,1930,4.7395209580838324
7931557,5,B0000560QE,"Having no familiarity with classic Japanese theatrical forms, I bought this DVD to get a pleasant means of education. I could always sell it back on eBay, afterall, and get half my money back. It turned out to be, for me, much more than another foreign movie. Viewing this film was like being at a live performance with great actors - I was hypnotised, in awe of the raw emotions that spilled out(all while reading the English subtitles!). I will never part with this film, even if I sold the DVD-it will always be with me!",1098403200,8,523,4.458333333333333
7931558,4,B0000560QE,"Masahiro Shinoda's ""Double Suicide"" is one of several cinematic adaptations of famed Japanese playwright Chikamatsu's classic Bunraku puppet play ""Shinju Ten no Amijima (Double Suicide at Amijima.)""  Bunraku is one of three traditional Japanese theater styles, and includes black clothed puppeteers onstage manipulating their miniature charges. The story is the struggle between ninjo and giri, personal feelings and social duty.  This struggle is the dominant theme of Japanese theater, bringing to life the oft-quoted expression ""the nail that sticks up must be hammered down.""  To act from personal emotions is devastating.
Shinoda combines classical theater with stunning modern film techniques and cinematography.  The nod to the origin of the story is found in the black clad puppeteers who hover in the background.  It is a most excellent film in every way.  It is all the more exceptional for its essential ""japaneseness,"" far more so than Kurosawa's westernized films. The artificialness of Japanese theater is also captured well, as opposed to the attempted naturalness of western theater.
I do agree that this Criterion Collection DVD is beautiful, but sadly lacking for extras.  In many other films the lack of extras would not be so important, but ""Double Suicide"" is a film that craves exploration.  A filmed sample of the original Bunraku production, for example.  Some background on
Chikamatsu.  Those not familiar with Bunraku might not understand the dark, background puppeteers or be confused by the artful melodrama.
Still, even with such a barebones production, and excellent film and and an excellent DVD.",1075075200,30,1627,5.446215139442231
7931559,5,B0000560QE,"A number of reviewers of Criterion discs have commented that it's too bad that some of their discs have lots of extras while some (such as Double Suicide) have none.
My response is to judge the film on its own merits.  If it weren't for Criterion, I probably never would have heard of this film, and I certainly never would have seen such a luminous transfer.  The film is beautiful and strange, and warrants multiple viewings.
Critics of the lack of extras should also note that the more ""bare-bones"" Criterion discs are priced less than the fully-packed ones.
I think Criterion did a really great job with this wonderful film.",986860800,23,628,4.7
7931560,3,B0000560QE,"Come on, raiders of unusual images, Masahiro Shinoda's DOUBLE SUICIDE is a movie for you. Shot in black and white in 1969, this Criterion release will satisfy your delicate taste deceived by the clichs Hollywood serves you by the dozen each week of the year. In DOUBLE SUICIDE, one and only actress plays the two main feminine characters and, believe me or not, I didn't notice it until the end of the movie. Adapted from a 1720 ( ! ) japanese doll drama, DOUBLE SUICIDE relates the tragic love story of a courtesan and a paper merchant. The establishment, symbolized in the movie by the family and the moral code of the bourgeoisie, will lead the two lovers to take a dramatic decision.
The story is melodramatic but Masahiro Shinoda's cinematography transforms this simple story into a universal drama by adding a prologue and an epilogue that I let you discover by yourselves. Another interesting idea from the director is to imagine that the men who traditionally handle the puppets would appear on the screen. Invisible for the characters, these men dressed in black will cross the path of the heroes and become for us a symbol of the Fate that doesn't leave the slightest chance to the unfortunate lovers.
I don't recommend this movie to those of you who are not familiar with japanese movies but I'm sure that the curious ones will appreciate DOUBLE SUICIDE and its stunning cinematography. Superb copy with only a Claire Johnston essay as bonus feature.
A DVD zone rising sun.",984960000,15,1484,4.778210116731517
