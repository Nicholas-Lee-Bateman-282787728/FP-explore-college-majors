8508448,5,B0071LHLIU,"To add to other reviews here: for humans, the water is both a life-giving force and an ominous threat: it is Felix and Orsi's only route to obtain food and water, and it is also the highway over which their tormentors arrive at their home and destroy them. Yes, its trees and wavelets are beautifully photographed, but there is lots more to this area of the Danube. It was wrenching for me to watch the final scene: Orsi's pet turtle, who is beloved and has been given healing energy to share with her, submerges into the stream: the turtle can always live in his home, he carries it with him, emerging from the surface and diving as he will. Completely unlike what the lovers' lumber-and-stilts home can do. The entire screenplay is alive with metaphor lying just beneath the surface of the script. A feast for the mind and heart as well as for the eyes.",1401148800,,855,4.487179487179487
8508449,4,B0071LHLIU,"Delta is clearly not a film your Hollywood type film lovers will enjoy.  The Hungarian film is brooding, slow paced, with minimal dialogue, more than usual lingering shots, and the forbidden love, incest.  The film takes place in the Delta region of Europe, and if you are not aware of the beauty of the magnificent locations, you will get a hint of it here.  You can see the vast body of waters, the grasses, the long boats, and the serenity of a significant and unique place in the world.

Again, the film has very minimal dialogue, and so little, that watching a foreign film, trying to read subtitles, you can actually have a conversation waiting for the next dialogue.

The small major cast players include a young man, Mihail whose father has died and he comes to the village to find his mother.  She is remarried, and introduces Mihail to his sister, Fauna.  Mihail plans to stay in the village and prepares to build a house.  The only people we see are the male townfolk who frequent the bar run by Mihail's mother and her husband.  They are a strange motley crew, fishermen, and not accepting to strangers and furthermore to the idea of a brother and sister living together.

Brother and sister build the home together, and fall in love, although there is very little that is indicated to the love affair.  It happens quickly and without much to go by.

The viewer must focus intently to grasp the storyline, much is not told, much happens without dialogue to provide inside and/or explanation.  There are many questions that remain unanswered.  Some of the more intense moments are known and occur, but yet not quite visible.  After the home is built, a celebratory housewarming party takes place with plenty of fish, bread, and alcohol.

This is clearly a unique approach to filmmaking, and it's not actually accepting to be left out of so much due to the lack of dialogue.  See it for the uniqueness it brings to foreign film

The Short Films included
Even more bizarre are the Short Films included in the DVD.  One has sexual displays, bordering on the graphically gross, while the others are just as weird!!!  ....Rizzo",1348704000,3,2133,4.682795698924731
8508450,4,B0071LHLIU,"I assure you it is a masterpiece unlike anything seen before. Cinematographer Kornl Mundrucz exhibits Romanian scenery beautifully with long pan shots accompanied by the music of Flix Lajk. Without giving away too much the closing scene in particular leaves the viewer in awe, acting as a bookend contrasting Mihail's original journey through the river landing him in Danube. I personally commend Kornl Mundrucz for his work in taking a different approach to filmmaking. Less is more and subtlety is key in this case.",1333670400,3,517,5.166666666666667
