7836396,5,6303065996,"This is an exceptional movie! Not one but two screen legends combine their star power to create this true magic!

The story is deeply touching. Clovis Mitchell/Jimmy Stewart raises alone his orphaned grandchildren Kelly/Stephanie Zimballs and Chris/Michael Sharett. Couple of weeks after their parents are killed in a fatal car crash, the family finds a little, crying puppy (Lassie) near their home at California's Napa Valley.  ""Lassie is godsend,  she needed us, we needed her."" -explains Clovis.

One day grandpa is approached by a rich industrialist who wants to buy his land. When grandpa refuses to sell, the heartless man takes Lassie and moves her to Colorado. Lassie escapes and makes a long and dramatic but triumphant journey back home.

There are some heartbreaking, some heart-warming and some funny, action-packed scenes, complemented by splendid cinematography  and mesmerizing soundtrack. The Magic of Lassie was Oscar Nominated for Best Music, Original Song for ""When you are loved"".

The cast is superb and Jimmy Stewart's performance is powerful and memorable as always. At the beginning of the film he sings: ""The whole world needs this hometown feeling again"". Nice jazzy and a somewhat sad song. One may wonder if that is Jimmy's swan song? Not really, after The Magic of Lassie, he consequently stared in Green Horizon and Right Of Way-his last film, which is his swan song. Sadly these last two movies are already out of print and almost forgotten.

I don't know why these great films are so unappreciated but I do know that we need ""that hometown feeling again, when neighbours use to share and people use to care."" We need to learn to care again. The Magic of Lassie is part of James Stewart's legacy, which we must preserve and pass over to the next generation! I bought my DVD copy (region 4) in Melbourne. It is a nice full frame transfer but it should be re-issued on a Widescreen format. You can buy this DVD on ebay.au, or you can order it from Amazon.uk (region 2) under the title Lassie - Vol. 4 - The Magic Of Lassie.",1160956800,11,2053,4.845714285714286
