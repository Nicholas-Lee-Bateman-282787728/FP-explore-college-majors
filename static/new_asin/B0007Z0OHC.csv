2253390,5,B0007Z0OHC,"I have always loved yoga and weight lifting, and combining the two is incredible!  This workout is challenging yet enjoyable.  And for something that does not raise my heart rate much, I sure do work up a sweat.  It combines light weights with traditional yoga postures, but adds movement to them to work muscles.  What amazes me most is how effective it is on the core -- you have to really hold tight in order to hold the poses while doing the strength moves!

I have enjoyed this workout more than almost any other I have purchased.  I highly recommend it to seasoned yogis as well as those just wanting to learn!",1125964800,8,616,4.455357142857143
2253391,3,B0007Z0OHC,"I felt like the yoga moves were done too slow.  However, if I weren't so impatient I should have stuck with this because I did feel ""the burn"" the next day.",1123200000,8,156,4.032258064516129
2253392,5,B0007Z0OHC,"I scan the top-selling exercise DVDs on Amazon just about every day for good workouts.  ""Iron Yoga"" intrigued me because it had been high on the list for a long time without any reviews (that has since changed).  The concept of using hand weights with Yoga looked appealing, since I'm keen on building and maintaining muscular strength with low-impact exercises.  Plus it seemed like a good way to shake up my normal Yoga routine.  So I got tired of waiting for reviews and decided to try ""Iron Yoga"" out.  It was worth the risk.

The entire workout takes about 55 minutes, including warm-up and cool down.  You can do the whole thing, or break it down by chapters.  There's also a bonus Yoga rejuvenation and relaxation session separate from the main workout (no weights needed).  I found out on the DVD extras that the instructor (Anthony Carillo) created Iron Yoga as part of his training for Iron Man Triathlons (maybe that should tell you something).  Mr. Carillo calls well, with a calm and non-threatening demeanor.  There are two female assistants on each side of him.  The one on his left demonstrates beginner's modifications, while the one on his right does the intermediate versions.  He leads the advanced poses.  I found that to be a pretty helpful configuration, since by looking at the appropriate person I could easily move into a less difficult pose (or go back into a harder one).

The hand weights are incorporated within a pose by using them in conjunction with Yoga breathing.  For example, while holding a pose you would breathe in through the nose, and at the same time do the first part of a bicep curl (contracting the arm).  Then, while breathing out through the nose, you would do the second half of the curl (extending the arm).  Holding the contraction while breathing is done as well, and various exercises are combined to work the entire upper body.  Proper breathing, technique and focus are continually emphasized by the instructor.  There are also salutations done without weights, featuring Downward Facing Dog, Plank, and Upward Dog positions.  No ankle weights are used, so at first I was worried about neglecting the lower body.  But I needn't have been concerned, because holding a pose while manipulating two three-pound hand weights works the legs quite nicely.

Even at the easiest level, it's still a tough workout.  The hardest part is trying to correctly utilize the weights while maintaining good Yoga form, especially during balancing poses like Tree, Eagle, and Warrior 3.  I'd start out with the hard version, but eventually had to slip into the intermediate and then beginning poses as time wore on and muscle fatigue increased.  I really had to concentrate in order to use the weights without falling over.  But I wasn't discouraged, since the challenge meant that this is a workout I can grow into.

The only disappointment was the very short abs section (something like one boat pose).  The abs do get worked as a byproduct of the routine, but you may have to incorporate your own stomach work if you like a lot of specific midsection exercises.  Also, I recommend using neoprene-coated weights (the instructor says one to five pounds is best).  They conform to the hand better than metal-handled weights, and the neoprene makes them easier to grip when sweaty (you *will* sweat during this workout).  If you like your Yoga more contemplative, feel that manipulating your own body weight is adequate, or struggle with balance due to physical issues, then this workout may not be for you.  But I recommend ""Iron Yoga"" if you want to add some low-impact strength training to your Yoga routine.",1123027200,208,3645,4.87479674796748

So I went on the hunt for a video that I could use when needed and found Iron Yoga.  I loved the fact that the trainer is an Iron Man as I am training for my 2nd marathon and want to set a PR.  I absolutely love this DVD.  It doesn't have a ""fun"" factor to it, it is very serious, but he is really good and explains each movement and correction perfectly.  I got a really great full body workout and will incorporate this DVD into my schedule over the next few months.  There are three trainers each allowing you to modify if needed for each pose.  He talks about muscle groups and focus for different sports during the workout which is nice, so you know why he is stretching your back or doing a lateral move. It is just under 1 hour and is a great way to get in some yoga sculpting!",1363651200,,959,4.037037037037037
2253444,4,B0007Z0OHC,"I bought the book on a whim and when I saw that there was a workout video to go with it, I had to track it down.

2253465,5,B0007Z0OHC,"I've been wanting to include a slow weight routine in my overall rotation of strength routines for a while now, but had worried that I would find a slow workout boring.  Because this routine includes yoga, it engaged my mind while challenging my balance.  This proved a great combination with the slow weights.

The concept behind slow resistance training is that you do light weights at a very slow pace of lifting and lowering the weight with excellent form.  This type of weight training is primarily recommended for beginners or those undergoing rehabilitation where they cannot handle the heavier weights.  However, slow work also makes a great occasional change up to keep your body from adapting to your normal weight routines or to shock your system out of weight loss plateau.  To keep my own weight loss journey going, I have been constantly rotating my strength routines to induce muscle confusion and keep my body working hard.

I would call myself an intermediate yoga practitioner and an experienced weight lifter.  I normally lift fairly heavy dumbbells (up to 15 pounds) so I started off with the heaviest dumbbells in the range that Anthony Carillo recommended -- 5 pounds.  One third of the way through the workout, I had to drop down to dinky 3 pound weights.  The combination of the slow weights and the challenge of holding the yoga poses gave me the shakes by the end of the routine.  The shakes were a sure sign that my body had a thorough workout that exercised the muscles to fatigue.  My muscles felt like they were humming, and my whole body felt relaxed and stretched.  It was a phenomenal workout.

I enjoyed Anthony's calm, soothing voice and loved the combination of strength and flexibility that this DVD provided.  I checked my copy out of the library, but am planning to purchase this one.  I think that it has earned a place in my regular rotation of strength workouts.

I do agree with the downsides that others have listed for this DVD -- it does not have a lot of ab work, and it does require a full hour of time.  I was willing to do an additional ab routine (I did the ""Stomach-Zapping Abs"" extra from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-Vedral-Speedy-Non-Stop-Fat-Meltdown-Plus-Stomach-Zapping-Abs/dp/B000R7I3UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce Vedral: Speedy Non-Stop Fat Meltdown Plus Stomach Zapping Abs</a>) and devote the extra time for this particular workout.

The instructor is terrific at guiding you through the session and for giving specific and precise instructions.  The segments are so well organized that you're guaranteed to get an excellent workout.  The pace is slow, but it doesn't mean you're not getting a good workout, in fact, you're targetting and isolating the muscles, working your balance, your breath all at once. It's multitasking at its best.  I highly recommend this video, in fact, it's the best yoga-weight workout DVD out there!",1339804800,2,635,4.897196261682243

2253469,5,B0007Z0OHC,"I have had this DVD in my home gym for ever but only started using it recently. Like many, the concept of weights plus yoga just didn't sit well with me. But I am a convert! I started using the program twice a week about a month ago and have already seen enormous benefits particularly in core and leg strength. Even some of that pesky stubborn back fat is starting to smooth out and my waist measurement has diminished. The program is demanding - particularly the moves that require balance - but with practice, you can improve your form and therefore improve your results. The program is well taught and demonstrated by Iron Man himself.

2253471,5,B0007Z0OHC,"I've been praticing yoga for approximately 15 years,and I've been teaching yoga for 5 years.  I use this DVD at home as a part of my personal pratice...especially on days I want a different kind of strength and balance challenge. Anthony's presence is calm and soothing (I realize some might consider him ""boring"", his voice does tend to be a bit monotone..I actually find that to be a relief). The workout is as gentle/non-challenging or challenging (strengthening)as you make this.
Some reviewers have commented there isn't much of an ""abs"" component to this DVD....your abs and core will be challenged throughout this workout by holding the postures correctly with weights extended out from your body.....trust me if your form is correct, whether fully in a pose or not, your core will be engaged, and your ""abs"" working. (as an aside the original purpose of yoga was not to build ""6 pack abs"".)
Holding a posture with equanimity, grace and strength..despite the ""challenges"" the ego presents when muscles are burning, or the brain says ""I'm bored"" or...""I'd rather do something else""...well than my friend you are truly praticing yoga. Get this DVD... it will relieve stress and tension from your day. It will help strengthen, ""lengthen"" and strech you.
You may (probably) very well be challenged...physically, mentally and emotionally. You will feel grounded, calm and connected when you have completed it.
If you're expecting a ""high intensity, enegertic, fast moving"" yoga DVD as performed in more popular DVDs...with larger marketing budgets....leave your expectations at the door... otherwise that will be just one more thing this DVD will challenge....and than you will be praticing ""Iron Yoga"".",1284940800,2,1705,5.2226277372262775

I renewed it a couple of times and decided to just buy it.  I started out at beginners level even though I already knew all of the poses because adding the weights makes you work on balance even more, which is definitely a benefit. The instructions are very clear and easy to do even if you have never done Yoga.  This is a great work out in many ways - over all strengthening and balance.

I need to do all the balance poses that I can to try and help delay the progress  my spino cerebral degeneration disease.  I know this dvd will not only challenge me but give me the added balance I am trying to keep as long as I can.

The instuctor gave clear advice on how to do the moves and breathing.",1229644800,2,591,4.25
2253474,3,B0007Z0OHC,"I have been practising yoga for several years, and purchased this DVD with the hope that I could combine the use of weights with the stretching and strengthing of yoga.

What I found was...yeah, okay.

While I found the premise of the use of weights a good one, and plan to continue using weights with my other tapes, I would hesitate to recommend this DVD on a few points.

First, if you have rotator cuff/shoulder problems, stay away. While the movements are all slow and steady, even a slight handweight would place undue strain on your shoulders, in particular if you are not too flexible in the upper body region. I have pretty strong and flexible arms, and by the end of the workout my shoulders were hurting (hurting:bad; sore:okay)Some of the standing positions are pretty much more for intermediate/advanced yogis, and there is very little in the way of alternate positions. Don't let the 'Core' thing fool you; this is an upperbody workout. There is very little in the way of core exercises outside of a modified Boat Pose, and the standing exercises seem to just exist so that you would not hit the floor with your weights.

On the plus side; it is close to an hour workout. By the end, I WAS sweating, though the movements were slow and therefore I was not out of breath. I used my heart rate monitor on this, and at least for me, it showed that I used close to 300 calories, have of them at the 'low target heartrate (fat-burning) rate. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the instructor's voice (but then again, I also don't find Brian Kest's irritating, either).

This is a good back-up tape for when you don't want to use your typical few favorites, but again, I would either do the exercises with little to no weights to save your shoulders, or use it to supplement a cardio or core workout.",1219708800,4,1838,4.524096385542169
2253495,5,B0007Z0OHC,"I bought this video after reading everyone else's reviews. My main goal is to get lean and not bulk up my muscles. I have done everything from the Biggest Loser videos to Taebo and they all leave me feeling tired and sore. This video however excercises more muscles than Taebo and makes me feel so relaxed after it's done it's amazing!
The yoga poses really stretch your muscles and the added weights really challenge your strength. I think this exercise is the best I've done and I would highly recommend it for someone that want's to challenge all muscles and not feel exhuasted after it's done.",1215734400,3,597,4.6415094339622645

While most yoga DVD's leave me either befuddled and confused about which foot and hand goes where, or in a fit of giggles over the sappy music and the seriousness in which the leaders seem to take themselves...this DVD was very clear and straight forward.  I really appreciated the instructor's concise, to the point instructions...no flowery image inducing nonsense...but reminders to inhale and exhale with the movements.  He also mentions specific muscles and targets where you should feel the movements so you know immediately if you are doing it correctly.  There are also frequent reminders to keep your core muscles engaged.  The balancing poses are challenging...but not impossible.  And as other reviewers mentioned, there are 3 levels so you can increase or decrease the challenge as needed.  I haven't even done the workout with weights yet...figuring that it would be better to work on correctly achieving the positions/movements...and it is still challenging.

They tried to combine the two and it didn't work for me.  When I do yoga I feel a sense of well-being and my body feels like it has benefitted from head to toe.  This didn't give me that feeling at all!  When I lift weights, I can definately feel that I have accomplished something and my muscles are fatigued.  This video didn't do that for me either.  Maybe it works for some people, but I didn't enjoy it.

2253537,5,B0007Z0OHC,"The main premise of Anthony Carillo's Iron Yoga workout is that you can maximize your yoga session by adding hand weights to increase the challenge.  The result is a highly effective, low-impact yoga routine that demands great focus, endurance, balance, flexibility, and willpower.

The 54-minute Iron Yoga workout is led by instructor Anthony Carillo, who designed the routine as part of his training for the Iron Man Triathlon (this should give you some clue as to how effective and demanding the workout is).  Although Carillo leads you through an advanced workout, there are two women working through the same routine in the background; one at a beginner level, the other, intermediate.  The most obvious difference is that each instructor uses a different set of dumbbells.  You can clearly see that the beginner is working with a 2-pound set, while the intermediate instructor sports a 3-pound pair (which is the weight I use).  However, I couldn't tell what weight Carillo was working with, and he never mentions it.  Aside from lifting different weights, the beginner and intermediate models modify the yoga poses to demonstrate easier levels for less experienced yoga students.  In general, the transition between poses is gradual enough that beginners won't have any trouble following along, and the risk of tweaking a muscle with the weights is significantly lowered for all.  Consequently, Iron Yoga is a great workout for both beginners and experienced yogis alike: you can vary both the weight and the poses according to your fitness level.

During the workout, Carillo leads the audience through a number of challenging yoga poses, including the triangle, several warrior series, awkward chair, tree sequence, and eagle.  Poses that help with stretching and flexibility include the sun series, upward and downward facing dog, locus, pigeon, and child's pose.  Throughout the workout, he also incorporates various moves with the dumbbells to work the upper body.  Examples include bicep, tricep, and wrist curls, tricep extensions, military presses, and lateral raises.  These exercises are performed either while standing in mountain pose, or while holding some of the more challenging yoga poses (e.g., triangle).  The dumbbell work, with few exceptions, involves three slow reps of each move while inhaling and exhaling deeply, and on the fourth count you must hold the move at ""static peak"" for several breaths.  Depending on the yoga pose and the dumbbell exercise, this can be much harder than it sounds!

As an instructor, Carillo is great: simultaneously calm and soothing and motivational and encouraging (not exactly what you'd expect from an Iron Man!).  On their own, neither the yoga nor weighted portions of the workout are exceptionally challenging; but combined, they make for a very demanding routine.  I've been doing yoga for several years now (in addition to some light weight training, as well as pilates, kickboxing, and Tae Bo), and am in fairly good shape, but I still find myself sore the day after I do Iron Yoga.  Of the many DVDs I own, this is probably in my top six favorites.  It's a fun break from the frenetic cardio sessions I'm used to, but it's still effective, especially for toning the upper body.  With both yoga and weights, it's the best of two worlds.  Kind of like yoga on (natural) steroids (!).

My only complaint is that Carillo has only made one Iron Yoga DVD to date (hint, hint!).

EQUIPMENT NEEDED: A pair of dumbbells and a yoga mat or carpeted floor.  A masseuse for the day after won't hurt, either!",1150329600,24,3566,5.073756432246999
2253538,5,B0007Z0OHC,I consider myself an intermediate yoga practitioner but this DVD really pushed me to the limit. When I first watched it it looked very easy because the exercises are very simple but because of the weights and the slow repetitions it is very challenging which I love!!. At the end I felt very relaxed. Highly recommended if you wanna try something new and refreshing.,1147737600,24,366,4.734375
2253539,5,B0007Z0OHC,"I've been doing some really high impact workouts - weights and resistance bands.  The kind of workouts that leave you exhausted, sweaty and sore.  This is the equal of any of them.

The combination of balance and weight training is amazing.  If you're looking for one of those body blasting aerobic workouts, this isn't it.  If you want a great full body workout to invigorate, strenghten and build lean muscles, this is the one.

I don't recommend just jumping in and starting.  Do the routines without weights a couple times, build up to it then add weights and work up to the moderate, then advanced poses.",1138320000,60,609,4.688679245283019
2253540,5,B0007Z0OHC,"I love this workout, the weights provides a lot of variety to the basic yoga poses.  It's also well constructed - you change it up a bit, instead of going from the poses on the left leg directly to the exact same routine on the right leg.  You can make it easier or harder with different hand weights.  However, I need to add some warnings.  This workout was created by iron-man triathletes, which means it is HARD!  You keep the same pose a looooooong time, lots of balancing on one leg.  At least a basic knowledge of yoga is extremely helpful, as well as a basic level of fitness (not a great ""lets get back in shape in January"" kind of workout DVD).  I can see why this video of isometric exercises is a nice changeup for someone who bikes, swims, or in my case runs a lot.  I highly recommend it, but not for the beginner.",1136592000,24,827,4.222929936305732
2253541,4,B0007Z0OHC,"My boyfriend pointed out to me, as i told him i would do this exercise before work, that i would be ironing, ironically with Yoga and the daily ritual of ironing my work shirt. But i decided to try this dvd late at night about 10:30, and i just had to start out with 5 pound weights!!! For each arm!! It was hard to keep the poses with the weights, so about half way i went back to three and that did the trick. The instructor is pretty good and seems laid back, and makes all the exercises look easy...of course. What i liked about this video is:

yoga: any yoga is good yoga

weights: were a twist! And he worked them well with the yoga

reminders: everybody has trouble remembering when to breath or when to hold your core muscles, he does a good job in reminding you without distracting you at the task at hand.(he does so with words at the bottom of your screen and he tells you)

breathing: is essential to yoga and i found it helpful to breath, the weights make you want to breath! 2 for one kind of deal

poses: all the basic poses were in there like warrior,eagle, the cat, sun salutations

music: is very soothing and nothing is rushed

be careful: i skipped the introduction but i don't think it was majorly important(i'll go back!), but do be care with your positions. If you get sore back off! Do you think i was really going to tough it out with 2 five pound weights! My neck and shoulders got a little sore but thats because i had to look up to see what he was doing.

If you haven't done yoga before this dvd might be a little intimidating but it is fun to do with his beginning to advance poses(he has two assistance that help). ANd don't use weights to big for your britches people! *cough*

Funny things i notice about the dvd:

* does talk a bit funny, but you get used to it

* back ground is horrible, some kind rusty clockwork and bathrrom clear blocks on the bottom...weird

* the two assistance are very stoic, but he is friendly

* you can buy his book for 1.70 here on amazon(used that is)

* its funny when they talk to you and you can't look up and see what their doing because they tell you to look down

over all its true to its word, i might incorporate into my workout every once and while, good addition to your exercise library!",1134432000,29,2263,4.193995381062356
2253542,4,B0007Z0OHC,"I do yoga several times a week, and this dvd is pretty challenging. You use weights the entire time through all the movements, and it moves slowly, so you feel the burn! If you like more faster moving power yoga, this is probably not for you, but you can always increase your weights and make it burn some more!!",1127865600,14,312,4.305084745762712
2253543,5,B0007Z0OHC,"You can do this routine with out the dumbbells and you will feel the challenge any way.

The time that the positons are hold it's challenge and you will improve all your muscules, but at the end you will feel your mind free.

I like a lot the rithm of the voice that is use in the hole DVD.",1127433600,5,290,3.8983050847457625
2253544,4,B0007Z0OHC,"This is just like traditional yoga but there is a twist - you use light dumbbells.  This adds to the already toning effect that yoga has on you.  They use very controlled movements making you aware of every breath you take and awareness of your body.  Because of the weights, it's really very challenging, but hey - everyone needs to challenge themselves every now and then right?  This is tough but there are great results in store if you use this often.",1127347200,37,455,4.512195121951219
2253545,5,B0007Z0OHC,"This DVD is excellent.  Not only is it concise, it has three demonstators,one for beginners, intermediate and advanced yoga practices.  The narrator speaks clearly and gives enough explanation so that it easy to keep up, retain postures and maximzie your postures. It is great way to enhance your strength, build some muscle and feel that your postures have moved to the next level.",1127260800,9,382,5.0476190476190474
2253546,5,B0007Z0OHC,"This workout adds a great variety to anyone's workout.  If you enjoy yoga this adds an extra challenge by adding hand weights.

8054437,2,B0007Z0OHC,Bizarre and not at all what I expected even after reading the reviews.  I had to turn if off half way through out of boredom and feeling like I was wasting my precious workout time. I will donate this to the library and will not do it again.,1488585600,,241,4.020833333333333

8054443,3,B0007Z0OHC,"It's ok. Somewhat challenging to do yoga whilst gripping hand weights, but that's the point! It lost 2 starts for low production values. As for the workout itself, it's easy to follow as the instructor goes slow enough.",1451520000,,219,4.7894736842105265
