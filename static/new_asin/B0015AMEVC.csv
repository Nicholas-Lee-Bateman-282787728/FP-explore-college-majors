3143319,5,B0015AMEVC,"I had seen this video at a training seminar and loved it.  Now I am a trainer and wanted it for my clients and know it will make a huge difference in the way they look at customer service.  Was so happy to find a used one here on Amazon since it is approximately $900.00 to buy it new!  Everytime my husband and I go somewhere and a business does something extra for us we look at each other and say ""pickle"" and it is understood : )",1301529600,3,433,3.897727272727273

8257965,1,B0015AMEVC,"This is absolute garbage!  I work for a bank who was foolish enough to purchase this.  It is silly nonsense!  There is nothing of value in this!  It is the self righteous and incoherent ramblings of a senile old man!  Don't be as foolish as Citizen's Bank, save your money!",1476489600,,273,4.38
8257966,5,B0015AMEVC,"Funny, engaging and definitely a must see for any customer service based business.  Don't let the fact that this was released many years ago deter you, it's still an extremely relevant video.",1456617600,,191,4.96875

A GEM of a soul. Right to the point. imagine
losing a cheap pen and getting a dollar's
worth of public relations.",1383436800,,157,4.266666666666667
8257972,5,B0015AMEVC,"I watched this during a training session at work. I was expecting another ""Ho-hum"" training tape but this one was different. I really kept thinking about getting or not getting ""the pickle"" each time I interacted with tellers, cashiers, wait staff through out my day. What made it even better, was as a child my grandparents took me to Ferrell's Ice cream parlor and I got the Free Ice cream sundae on my birthday...so the story is real. I give this training video a thumbs up!",1366761600,,477,4.558139534883721
8257973,1,B0015AMEVC,"I was disappointed in the quality of this video, it advertised as good quality but was very distorted as well as it bounced around alot.  I saw this video about 12 years ago and thought It was a great video for training on customer service for my staff but wasn't thrilled when I reviewed it prior to the meeting.",1344384000,,313,4.305084745762712
