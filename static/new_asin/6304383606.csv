But in particular, Sir Nigel Hawthorne's performance is stellar.  It felt as though the actors fed off of each others' energy and it seemed to create a very dynamic production.  Even though I am not generally a particularly politically demonstrative person, seeing this film made me want to support organizations like Amnesty International.

I was impressed particularly because I have seen Sir Nigel Hawthorne in Madness of King George, Clandestine Marriage, Yes Minister, and even as Santa Claus in Call Me Claus with Whoopi Goldberg -- and it impressed me greatly how he was able to bring to life the innate callousness and cruelty of the South African colonel in this film.  Hawthorne has an uncanny ability to be completely in character in every role he plays, as though he changes personalities like a chameleon changes colors, disappearing or subsuming himself into his role, and is practically unrecognizable from one role to the next.  It's amazing what truly great actors can do with their craft -- they take their art to a different level altogether, and we always learn from them something new about being a human being.",1487030400,,1277,4.9392523364485985

7870957,5,6304383606,"Exceptional film with some very good plot twists and strong performances by all of the actors. South Africa decided to go with a Reconciliation Commission instead of holding a lengthy series of trials to punish the thousands of human rights crimes committed by officials of the apartheid regime. I can't possibly second guess this decision, but I think t's a minor miracle that there weren't widespread reprisals like those that occurred in Rhodesia. Knowing that the vast majority of human rights crimes of the apartheid regime wen't unpunished, the film effectively demonstrates the gaping hole that is left when such widespread human rights criminality goes unpunished  I also thought it was an interesting choice to make the central victim an Afrikaner.  Effective cinematography brings the viewer inside of the prison cells and highlights the psychological damage such isolation does to a prisoner.",1343174400,2,903,5.352112676056338
