1339776,4,B00004CJZ5,"I saw this gem a couple decades ago on late, late nite TV and the site of the goggled Nazi corpses slowly emerging from the Florida surf was a creep-out that has stayed with me to this day.  Obviously on a very low budget, the producers and director did a rather inventive job with what they had.  You have to figure that Peter Cushing and John Carradine were probably looking for a Florida vacation, since their parts are mostly cameos.  It still holds up quite well today, a rare example of the ""daytime creep-out"", rather a difficult thing to do, particularly in a tropical location usually reserved for Beach Blanket Bingo and the like.  The sets are terrific, probably because they were using actual interiors from an abandoned hotel in Palm Beach much of the time.
A very fun movie, if for nothing else, the wonderful Peter Cushing's effortless work as a German commander, exiled in paradise.

1339777,4,B00004CJZ5,"A group of vacationers become stranded on a tropical island and are terrorized by a troop of what appears to by Nazi zombies that live underwater.  Although it sounds silly, Shock Waves is far from that.  It is actually a tense and spooky little cult movie from the seventies that has continually freaked out many a late night TV/cable viewer.  At long last this movie returns to video in a delightful letterboxed release that features a commentary by cast and crew members (moderated by low budget filmmaker Fred Olen Ray) as well as a collection of poster art, stills, trailers, and even a documentary (no doubt there will be an Easter Egg goodie or two somewhere in the mix as well).  Stylish and strange enough to be truly memorable, Shock Waves is a cult movie deserving its reputation, highly recommended.",1028678400,4,811,4.771428571428571
1339778,5,B00004CJZ5,"This is another excellent Peter Cushing movie where he was an SS doctor/officer that attempted to create the ""master race"" - aka zombies (all blond). At the end of the war, the zombies were entombed in the bow of a ship and sunk to the bottom of the ocean near an unknown island. Chance would have it that a ship on a pleasure cruse, captained by John Carradine, happens to sink near the island during an earthquake and the zombies are also freed. The real trouble begins for the people stranded on the island...",1028419200,2,512,4.457446808510638
1339779,5,B00004CJZ5,"Yes, this is a low budget horror/zombie fest, but this is a GOOD one.  John Carradine and Peter Cushing add some acting experience, of course, but the setting and the plot are scary by themselves.  The deserted island is creepy, with lots of water and hanging green scenery for the zombies to rummage through.  The idea of finding a deserted mansion (or resort or hotel or whatever the heck the place is) is always shiver inspiring.  The zombies themselves are truly frightening--no meaty parts falling off of them in this one, these are self-contained and if slow moving, no less menacing.  This is a film for late at night, with the lights off.  Young Brooke Adams (of the second Body Snatchers fame) is in her first role and is very good.  If you enjoy scary movies or zombie movies, this is one for you.  Five stars out of five from me.",1028332800,4,840,4.516556291390729

1339801,5,B00004CJZ5,"I found this one by accident, and remembered that I saw this film a long time ago as a kid.

Rediscovering now, as an adult, I find it holds much charm and originality for the horror genre of the 1970s. The director really creates a sense of dread and utilizes atmosphere to make this creepy.

Fans of older horror will immediately recognize John Carradine and Peter Cushing, despite their short roles. Though both of them steal every scene they appear in with their talents.

The plot is fairly straightforward. A group of people, touring islands (presumably in the Caribbean) become adrift under mysterious circumstances. They find the compass not working, eerie lights and strange illusions with the sun, before they are hit by a ship, along with engine failure.

They seek refuge on a nearby island, only to find out the mysterious wreck of a ship they encountered is a sunken Nazi ship, filled with soldiers who were a product of their governments experiments to create unstoppable, killing machines.

This film proves to me that with nearly non-existent gore, very little in the way of actual onscreen violence, a film can stand on its own with the sheer creepy factor of the atmosphere and the foreboding feelings that go along with the unsettling scenery.

This is definitely a must see for 1970s horror fans, and I find it quite enjoyable.",1483142400,,1348,4.839130434782609

It is still as creepy today, which tells you it is not about the budget, blood, or guts, but the atmosphere the producers set and the psychology the director uses. Yes, the acting is mostly atrocious (except for the veterans Peter Cushing and John Caradine, and the talented Karen Allen), but the soundtrack is eerie, and the photography suitably moody. SPOILER ALERT: The irony of escaping the Nazi Zombies in a furnace was not lost on me. How this does not rate number two on the best zombie movies lists (after the original Night of the Living Dead) baffles me. Somebody make a sequel!

1339811,5,B00004CJZ5,"Shock Waves is a classic, eerie movie from the early 70s. It still stands out with its mostly quiet action and bizarre music. The movie is heavy with atmosphere instead of relying on today's standards of over the top gore and shock scares.
I used to watch it on tv when I was a kid and the move still creeps me out today.
Unlike modern brain candy horror, Shock Waves is slow paced, which may turn off many modern horror movie viewers along with its lack of gore and blood.",1474329600,,473,4.266666666666667
1339812,5,B00004CJZ5,"Blue Underground does it again!  A great Blu-ray release of a great film, Ken Wiederhorn's story of undead SS troops besieging a group of marooned tourists on a beautiful tropical island.  If that plot doesn't pique your interest, then there is truly no hope for you.  The cast includes Peter Cushing, Brooke Adams and John Carradine.  Apparently Blue Underground restored this using the only known surviving film material.  I'm not an expert on the technical aspects of film restoration, but from this layman's view the picture looks good, especially in light of what they were working with.  And the audio (on my non-surround sound system) was clear and not at all muddled-like.

1339817,3,B00004CJZ5,"""Shock Waves""(1977) is directed by Ken Wiederhorn. This film is about a group of people who land upon an island which seems abandoned except for a former Nazi commander(Peter Cushing) who is living in a large dilapidated mansion. However the island has in its swamps the remnants of what was a Nazi secret weapon: zombie storm troopers.

This film appears to have been remastered and restored as it looks quite clean and free of dust. The movie was filmed in 16mm so it doesn't have the detail one might expect from a higher resolution film though this might actually add to the mystic of the film. There are quite a few special features including individual interviews with actors Brooke Adams, and Luke Halpin, producer Reuben Trane, and Richard Einhorn who composed the electronic soundtrack",1456444800,,794,4.925373134328358
1339818,2,B00004CJZ5,"The interviews in the extra call this a 'cult film'. It seems like just about every low budget horror or sci-fi movie that comes from the 20th century is called a 'cult' films these days. I'm not sure how big a following this movie has but it really wasn't very good. Even taking the low budget into account it's not very good. Peter Cushing and John Carradine were paid for a few days each and the producers didn't get a whole lot of use out of them. They don't stick around very long. Apparently they were just collecting a quick paycheck.

As far as calling this the best of the nazi zombie movies goes....the rest of them must be pretty bad. I think I've seen just one other up to this point and it was horrible so I guess it's sort of a back handed compliment.

If not for the low budget I would have given it one star. The usual large amounts of illogical behavior are present in a movie of this type.

The blu-ray transfer is not very good. Sometimes I wonder why the even bother if the transfer is going to be no better than regular DVD quality.

Recommended only for 'nazi zombie' fans (have no idea how many are out there) and anybody who has to have every Peter Cushing movie ever made (he is just around in a supporting role).",1456444800,,1238,4.25531914893617

This may be the most bloodless horror film ever. Nice ultra minimal synth score too. They should've written Cushing a grand little speech - he's almost wasted here. The extra interviews are good, maybe an hour of content. And Ms. Adams has three things to do: wear bikini; scream; run. All in all a nice package, but tame and predictable story, and an absolute minimum OF story, will keep this from your top ten list.

1339841,5,B00004CJZ5,"This is one of those '70s horror flicks that utilizes the atmosphere and the creepy music to make it a definite ""cult"" classic. John Carradine (THE HOWLING), Peter Cushing (STAR WARS) and Brooke Adams (INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS '79) are the only recognizable actors.
It's a well done movie with Peter Cushing's character being the lead as the former commander of the Nazi ""undead"" soldiers. He was part of a team during WWII to create a highly adaptable soldier. The soldiers then became uncontrollable and violent, even sometimes challenging their own Nazi's in the field of combat. The War came to an end and Peter's character took the soldiers on a ship to avoid capture and sailed for weeks. He intentionally ran it aground near a remote island. That's where our story picks up. Unsuspecting tourists on a sailboat ride find themselves lost and end up on that particular island of all places. They venture ashore only to find an abandoned Hotel of sorts with Cushing's character inhabiting the place. After introductions, he advises them to leave the island as soon as possible for there is danger all around the island. The window to leave is closed upon the weary traveler's and they must fight off the undead. One by one, they fall victim to their menacing ""thirst"" to kill and drowning.... or do they?
The DVD itself could have been better, but I suppose at least it is widescreen with a few extras from Blue Underground Entertainment.
The DVD is 1:85:1, Dolby Digital 2.0 and runs about 85 minutes with credits.
The movie is not a gore fest, but it is spooky and the music really adds to the feel of the whole creepy island effect. Trees and the water look as if they are menacing. I am reminded of another zombie movie that came out after this in 1979 called ""ZOMBIE"" here in the US. It was the sequel (of sorts) to the very popular movie ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"". In ZOMBIE, a few crew members from a sailboat go abroad to track down one of the crew's father living on the island. Well, once there, the creepy tropical island effect with the music takes over and eventually they are all in danger.
~ Richard Einhorn needs to be commended on a brilliant horror soundtrack!
~ BLURAY EDITION:  Some Great Features also on this edition including a very nice interview with two of the people who try and escape the island toward the end of the movie. Brooke Adams being one of them. She looks good for her age and talks about this movie and what it's like to be known now as a horror icon of sorts. Get that one as it appears to be more cleaned up than this DVD edition if you want to spend a few more bucks on it. It's worth it.",1440115200,3,2634,4.4875

1339857,5,B00004CJZ5,"A group of stranded tourists play hide and seek on an island teeming with waterlogged Nazi Zombies from the deep.
The plot faithfully follows the standard horror archetype........trap a bunch of people in a confined spot then pick them off one by one.  The violence is kept safely hidden off screen, the bodies posed afterwards to demonstrate that something had been done to them, exactly what is mostly guess work.  We're alerted up front with a narration explaining there was a secret experiment with Nazi soldiers to make them invincible.  Then the movie starts at the end and plays out the story as a remembrance.  This doomed group of adventurers set sail on a crappy boat owned by a crabby captain with an acerbic wit (the fabulous John Carradine).  Also along for the ride is a bickering couple, a stray tourist with issues about confinement, and the requisite babe of sorts (Brooke Adams as Rose).  No stranger to water, the crew consists of Luke Halpin as Keith and a cook with definite hygiene problems.  On the island, they meet a Nazi recluse (Peter Cushing as a cadaverous SS Commander).  In no time at all, a veritable army of Nazis bob to the surface and slowly track down their victims...........one.........by...........one.  The movie is 85 minutes long so they have to take their time.

I freely admit that I love this film but I'm certain there are some who won't appreciate the slow pace and lack of violence and/or gore that's usually expected in zombie flicks.  Instead, this film thrives on atmosphere and an overriding sense of doom.  The action is sparse.  And although there is a high body count, it really doesn't seem to count as it's not shown.  It's not particularly scary but it is artfully done!",1427328000,3,1728,4.774410774410774
1339858,2,B00004CJZ5,"It's a Great Blu Ray but I have only one complaint. There are 2 scenes that skip near the end. The fault is not with the disc,it was on the Film print itself. When the Zombie rises out of the water in the end near Keith in the Boat it skips(Like if it were missing a clip or two of film)Then it happens again soon afterwards. It's only twice and it's quick,but,it is noticable and very disappointing. Although it occurs twice right at the end it's still a mood spoiler. Did Blue Underground NOT use the same print they used for the DVD version? The DVD copy pays flawlessly from Beginning to End. I am keeping my DVD copy. Has anyone else experienced or noticed this?If You have please reply to this comment and let Me Know. I know it's not the disc or my Samesung Player because i checked it out on 2 other players and get the same results. The Film Print that was used must have missed a few clips during those 2 'Jumps'. If  it wasn't for that I would have given this Blu Review 5 Stars. Someone wasn't paying attention during the Transfer Process. Its a shame because it ruins the ending for the Viewer of this Great Horror Film. If I show Shock Waves to Family and Friends,I'll, have to use the DVD version.

Blue underground give special edition treatments to low budget films that fans like
and so they should
some films Blue underground release on blu-ray i used to watch on VHS tape growing up
whether it's Horror, thriller or Action
and have been very impressed & amazed with the blu-ray transfers they give
and other films i'm discovering for the first time on blu-ray
and SHOCK WAVE is one of those 70's Horror/thrillers that i've never seen yet
and Blue underground has released it on Blu-ray with lots of new special features to
Shock wave was released in theaters about 1 year after JAWS was shown in Theaters
so like many films from the 70's that are now released on blu-ray i expect very Good HD transfers better than DVD

about the film, the story line is pretty Good a really Good atmospheric thriller
about Nazi storm troopers/super soldiers created from world war II, created my scientists
these Nazi zombies were known as the Death corps
the Nazi commander who ordered the soldiers to be created is played by Peter cushing
these soldiers & the Nazi commander have survived and are now in Florida
filmed in Florida 1976, Actors Brooke adams ( her first acting role)
John carradine, Luke Halpin and other actors are stuck in the middle of this Horror and try to survive the zombies
The zombies look really Creepy & Horrific make up effects person Alan ormsby did a Great job
the Music score is very errie & creepy i must say it makes this lowbudget thriller more frightening

Unfortunately tragically this new blu-ray transfer from Blue underground does look average still some grain in the picture
there's no HD resolution the film looks like a dvd transfer from the dvd release from years ago
there are many films from the 70's released the same year as shockwaves that are now on blu-ray
and i tell you the picture quality is amazing very clear not much Grain at all.
so this 1977 film is no Different as far as i'm concerned
sadly for some reason Blue underground did not make the effort to clean up the picture quality
blue underground's other Horrors & thrillers they've released on blu-ray look much better clearer picture quality
than they have done for shockwaves
so i was shocked when i watched the film i thought terrible blu-ray transfer i expected more
the sound quality is average to just a Master audio stereo mix

lots of special features thou
a new interview with Producer/Cinematographer Reuben trane
he gives recollections on making shock waves, very interesting 25min interview
a new interview with Actress Brooke adams who's aged quite a bit has arthritis now
she obviously does not do Acting roles anymore i think she left the business years & years ago
i think that is why she wasn't interviewed for the INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS MGM BLU-RAY release
which has a retrospective featurette with Donald sutherland, Veronica cartwright and others
anyway Brooke gives her recollections about Shock waves being her first film, only 7min interview for some reason
her interview could've been longer, make an extra 5mins longer
another interview with Actor Luke Halpin, 8min interview only
there's a brand new interview with music composer for the film Richard Einhorn
he talks about how Difficult it was to produce the music score for the film based on the music technology back in the 70's
no new interview with Director Ken wiederhorn
but Ken does do a feature length Audio commentary for Shockwaves
Ken just gives his recollections on making the film and jokes about it through out the film
he does talk about Brooke adams, Peter cushing, David carradine alot and the location of the film
so he doesn't joke around the whole time, the commentary is informative
Make up designer Alan Ormsby joins in with the commentary
there's Theatrical trailer, poster & stills Gallery, TV & radio spots as usual

Lots of special features but the blu-ray transfer is average
only gave it 2 stars based on the picture quality",1418428800,,3996,4.803779069767442

The story, atmosphere, zombies and eerie soundtrack make this a very enjoyable and creepy film. My only issue with the film itself may be with the not so bright lead characters, and their blatant lack of common sense or survival skills. That aside, I'm not really here to review the film itself. Most people reading this are probably already familiar with the film. This review is on the quality of the 2014 Blue Underground Blu-Ray release. I was excited to see this title getting a Blu-Ray release, and especially by Blue Underground. I have enjoyed what they have done in the past, so I was expecting a top notch product. As soon as the film began, the utter disappointment hit me. I'm no expert on film transfer, but the entire film is washed out and grainy. The lighting is inconsistent, as well as the sound. This does not appear to be remastered or High-Def in any way. Maybe I'm crazy, but my original DVD looks much better than this. If you have never seen this movie, I recommend buying the DVD version.

Der Tode Corps, . .. or the DEATH Corps; a secret batalion of soldiers created by the medical science division of the Third Reich in the secret laboratories of Kovlance coupled with the the Riechs clandestine occult practices initiated just prior to the onset of World War 2, and fashioned from the corpses of hoodlums, pathological murderers and sadists, . .. ""creatures not dead, nor alive, but somewhere in between""!  When the war ended an S.S. commanding officer ( played by Peter Cushing ), assigned to a group designed for nautical maneuvers, had deliberately sank his vessel and it's diabolical crew to the bottom of the ocean off the coast of an obscure and nameless isle where he'd since resided in voluntary exile.  Then, many decades later, a group of shipwrecked and stranded vacationers ( including ""B"" movie great John Caradine as a gruff old captain and the gorgeous feme Brook Addams from 1978's Invasion of the Body Snatchers ) accidentally arrive at the secluded setting, thus providing a cast of hapless victims for the emerging evil from the surrounding deep ( ""Hell's ocean""), .. . for ""Now THEY have returned""!!

Although typically overlooked, I have always considered THIS film to be one of the BEST and most underrated movies in the entire lexicon of zombie cinema. Truly exceptional and one of the few besides Night of the Living Dead I'd deem genuinely worthy of legitimate classic status.
To begin with, it's one of the very few movies of the whole zombie subgenre that was original and influential at all in it's own right instead of just being another NOTLD imitator ( like most other zombie flicks have been during the past forty so years ). It certainly had a unique, fascinating, scarry and, at the time it was made, novel basis and theme behind it's zombies, involving the mythical secret occult experiments of the nazis ( for more on THIS particular subject I suggest the book Occult Roots of Nazism by Nickolas Goodrick Clark ). This was also, I believe, the first movie in history, and still one of the few, to feature zombies that are AMPHIBIOUS ( and I don't mean bi-sexual mind you, . .. but in the sense that they can live underwater ) which is another thing which distinguished it at it's time and has since proven somewhat influential, even having been ""ripped-off"" ( so to speak ) itself by a few other films made in it's wake, namely and most notably Zombie Lake, Oasis of the Dead, and even the famous underwater scene ( involving the shark ) in Lucio Fulci's Zombie I suspect was influenced by THIS somewhat earlier film.
The zombies in this film are also quite sinister and frightening.  They're fierce, ruthless, violent, murderous yet totally cold in manner and seemingly intelligent ( unlike in allot of other zombie flicks ). Also, and most refreshingly, they don't do any of the usual and expected stuff like eat people or rip out guts and play with them or slobber, grunt, growel, groan, or walk in a silly staggering manner or any of THAT standard hokum.
This movie basically has all the qualities which I certainly value and admire in a horror film - t's eerrie, atmospheric, has a good original story and concept which is also genuinely frightening, is well made ( over all ) and, despite it's modest budget and though not jam-crammed with a $%!#load of really elaborate special effects, it does feature some VISUALLY striking and powerful scenes ( like particularly the very creepy and surreal shots of the undead soldiers walking about underwater without any kind of gear or artificial breathing apparatus ). I think that any other TRUE horror fan will like this flick too, especially if they're in the mood for a somewhat older fashioned one.

To wrap it up, I think that THIS is a movie that shows that ones name does NOT necesarily need to be Geaorge Romero or, for that matter, Lucio Fulci to make a good, well made, original, clever, scarry and truly classic zombie flick ( Bob Clarks Deathdream, I'll mention here, is another film I consider to be an example of same,.. but I'll talk about THAT one in another review ).",1333756800,6,4102,4.738095238095238
1339907,5,B00004CJZ5,"This movie scared the crap out of me when I first saw it on CBS late night back when they showed movies in place of the garbage they have now.

I have always enjoyed Peter Cushing, having grown up with his movies, and John Carradine is no slouch either.

A group of tourists on a second rate ocean cruise end up stranded on an island overseen by Peter Cushing, who turns out to be a self exiled Nazi. After building the characters up so you care about what happens to them, the scares begin, and Shock Waves delivers, refreshingly without gore laid on with a trowel.  The movie depends on characters and slowly building terror to make its point, and it does.

Billed as the ""Best Nazi Zombie Movie,"" I would have to agree. I've seen a lot of zombie movies, even the Italian ones, but this little gem is far and away one of the greatest.  But, like I said, I like Peter Cushing and John Carradine.

There are extras as well, including an interview with Luke Halpin in which he talks about the respect he has for Cushing and Carradine, Halpin is a class act.",1332115200,4,1056,4.33502538071066

The action is quick to surface, no pun intended, with the arrival of the ""Ghost Ship"", the deserted Island, with a three star hotel being used as a hermitage which is keeping a dark secret.  It is well know the NAZI's were big into the occult and this movie tugs on that string throughout the movie.  The acting is above average, to include a character you just want to shoot right off the bat.  The zombies are not the flesh eating kind, but have a more watery grave mentality, which really does make this a different type of zombie film.  The zombies are tame looking for today standards, but do pull of a wierd creepiness which is well captured in the movie.  The movie lacks the blood and gore of most zombie movies, but can hold the audience captive.  A good movie for any zombie lover.",1294531200,2,1022,4.433155080213904

That said, what can I say -- I really enjoyed this movie.

First off, you have a great premise, great location (the film was shot in Miami and features many scenes in the then-shuttered historic Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables), and the beautiful Brooke Adams in a bikini.

Add Peter Cushing, a wry John Carradine, creepy soundtrack and atmospheric directing, and you have a pulpy, fun B-movie zombie fest.

I fully understand why this film was a midnight movie staple at the Grove cinema back in the day.

I also enjoyed the extras, including interviews and old Miami Herald press clippings from when they filmed this in South Florida back in 1975.",1275350400,5,788,4.807407407407408
1339934,3,B00004CJZ5,"I fondly remember when I purchased my first VCR, a Curtis Mathes that cost $600 in the early 80's (Gawd, that was a lot of cash. Look at what they cost now!), one of the first horror movies I rented was this little oddball.

It's obvious from the beginning that the director wanted to rely more on eerie atmosphere and music than actual gore or violence. Sometimes that worked, most of the time it just fell flat. There's only so many times you can show some Nazi zombies standing in the bushes while playing ghostly music before the effect starts to wear thin.

A group of people on a pleasure cruise are stranded on a mysterious island and soon find themselves stalked by the 'Death Corp', Nazi soldiers created to man submarines. Not alive but not dead either, they were created so the u-boats would never have to surface. The character played by Peter Cushing, a former SS officer who helped create them, never explains why the submarines would not have to surface for fuel or more torpedoes, but whatever. And apparently, those crafty Germans knew a thing or two about creating 'super' uniforms as well. Even after more than 30 years underwater (the film came out in '77), the uniforms on the zombies still look great, right down to the bright red piping around the shoulder epaulets!

The most interesting twist in this film to me was that the male characters, with the exception of Luke Halpin, came 'unglued', getting hysterical at points, more quickly than the two female leads (Brooke Adams and DJ Sidney). Really unique, considering that it's the norm for the girls in horror films who normally lose their heads and scream like sissies.

'Shock Waves' gets a thumbs up for one of the more unique zombie movies ever made. But if you're expecting great suspense or excitement, you'll be disappointed. If only director Ken Wiederhorn could have talked cutie Brook Adams out of that teensy weensy yellow bikini.....",1270080000,2,1922,4.762762762762763
1339935,5,B00004CJZ5,"The 70's was the breeding ground for great horror films. The mainstream audiance was being treated to a slur of religious themed horror films (Exorcist, its sequel, The Omen, Beyond The Door) etc, and there was a big underground scene going on. In 1977, this indie shocker crept to theatres and made a small impact. But it's reputation since then has grown and it has been dubbed a classic, rightfully so. Of course there are many clones, the most obvious being the truely horrible Zombie Lake. But this movie, utilizing the underwater nazi zombie idea is very well crafted and lives up to its title. Although some might find it slow and lacking by modern standards, for those who like horror from the era when real horrror was being done, this one is a near essential. Staring an unknown Brooke Adams, and horror legends John Carradine and Peter Cushing, the low budget on this flick is apparent. Like Halloween a year after it, the writers wisely cast one (or 2) highly famaliar face to reel in their target crowd. Although they play the same usual ""warning theres something bad going on here"" character they've both always played, they do it with the bravado you'd expect of both the veterans. Some island tourists aboard a boat captaine'd by Caradine has some kind of equipment problems, loses its way, and gets sideswiped by a large unknown ship. They take refuge on a nearby island and not to give too much away, Cushing living there in isolation, is the former head of a core of superhuman killers (not dead nor alive but somewhere in between) that have just so happen to be rising from their watery grave on this day. Of course, on paper this sounds cheesy, however director Ken Wiederhorn really treats this flick as if it were the kind of late 60s Hammer film Cushing himself comes from. It's extremely eerie indeed. The music by Richard Einhorn is what really fills this movie with great tension and a very chilling atmosphere. Of course the shots of the monsters rising from the sea are the trademark image of the movie, this is one of the best horror films of it's decade, at least in the top 30. One thing that might irritate some waters is the lack of gore or any real violence, although others might find this a good thing. That doesn't mean this a kid movie, it's mood more than makes up for the lack of blood, and the raw low budget look will turn off anyone from the younger generation that is used to the typical Hollywood 10 million dollar slasher remake crap. This is a classic yet underlooked horror nugget.",1262822400,18,2530,4.599557522123894
1339936,1,B00004CJZ5,"Your name is Ken Wiederhorn. You are a first-time director. Amazingly, given that this is your freshman effort, you have acquired a decent budget, a tropical location, a premise that is morbidly interesting and a cast that boasts Peter Cushing, John Carradine, Brooke Adams and, er, the bloke who played the big brother in 'Flipper'. All in all, things are looking pretty good for you. You are young, you are brazen, you are full of micturite and vinegar and you are itching to make your mark. How is it then that you still manage to make one of the most boring films ever to be committed to celluloid? Seriously. How is it even possible to make a film about ship-wreck survivors being menaced by indestructible, underwater, Nazi-zombies on an abandoned tropical island, boring? More importantly, how is it even possible to make a film featuring Peter Cushing, boring? If you want to know, watch this film. But I beg you, please don't. I suffered so that you don't have to. Now there are films that are works of genius; films that are good; films that are decent; films that are watchable; films that are bad but entertaining ('Plan Nine From Outer Space', 'The Zombie Dead'); films that are just plain bad; and then there are films that will virtually cause one to gnaw their own arm off due to the tedium involved in enduring their wretchedness (Romero's 'Diary Of The Dead' is another such film). I'll give you three guesses which category this falls into. The best thing that I can say about it is that it's over in 90 minutes and that Roger Waters used a sample from it on track thirteen of his brilliant 'Amused To Death' album (which, unsurprisingly enough, was tangentially about the detrimental effect of modern media on the human psyche). Apparently, the original negative for this film has been lost for twenty years - I'd argue that this is proof of a loving deity attempting to right a crime of nature against his beloved creation.",1235174400,6,1944,4.703812316715543

They succeeded on creating a squad of soldiers who were neither living, nor dead. Allied troops later spoke of battling with this elite SS unit, known as the Death Corps, who fought without weapons and killed with their bare hands. The allies never captured a single member of this SS unit.

Two couples looking for some leisure time on the ocean take a dive boat out for some relaxation. The boat's captain (John Carradine) and first mate (Luke Halpin) expertly manage to shipwreck the boat near a remote island. Upon finding the home of a self-exiled Nazi commander (Peter Cushing) they all learn of the story of the undead super soldiers and what became of them. And unfortunately for the living, the troops are ready for service once again.

Ken Widerhorn's direction was passable, but ultimately, I think it's the acting that keeps this ship afloat. No, they're not spectacular performances, but overall they're pretty good. As it should be expected, veteran actors Carradine (The Astro-Zombies) and Cushing (Star Wars) are the standouts, though I don't think it's on either one of their best roles lists. Brooke Adams (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and Halpin (Flipper) put in some honest work while the rest of the main cast are fairly forgettable. Though don't discount the eight actors playing zombies. They did a yeoman's job and seemed to take their roles very seriously, adding a lot of believability to the film. That's saying a lot since they were cast from an ad put in the paper down on location in Florida.

These Nazi zombies look good for being some thirty plus years old. By that I mean they're not very decomposed. To their credit, they are on the pasty side and they're pretty wrinkled. You know how you get when you're in the bubble bath, er...shower too long? Sorta like that. They're still fairly creepy, though. Since we don't know how exactly these guys were created, you could explain away the decomposition by some kind of anti-aging zombification serum. What's more impressive is that their uniforms don't look decayed at all. You can rationalize the zombies, but not the uniforms I'm afraid.

SHOCK WAVES is the first film for director Ken Wiederhorn. Likewise, it's the first film for all the credited screenwriters as well as the producer. Many of the film's flaws can be attributed to the lack of experience, but even with its flaws, Shock Waves is very watchable and managed to attain a cult following over the years. I think there are a few reasons why.

First of all, it manages to escape what most zombie movies can't...simply being a crappy movie. If you can at least be an average zombie film, with the glut of all the really bad ones, you're destined to stick out among the crowd. Secondly, it's a rather unique take on the undead. Only ZOMBIE LAKE really comes close to the premise of underwater Nazi zombies, and SHOCK WAVES is head and shoulders above that dried-up piece of dead wood. Thirdly, there are a few very memorable scenes that will stick in your mind. For me, the best was the scene where all the undead Nazis rise up out of the water one by one and slowly head to shore. And lastly, you have the mere presence of John Carradine and Peter Cushing. Between the two, I think they've been in about a billion films and have both accumulated their own legions of fans throughout their career. Put it all together and you've got a flick that will continue to add to its following for quite some time to come.",1212883200,4,3601,4.746006389776358

1339942,4,B00004CJZ5,"As a zombie and Hammer completist, I made a point of buying this film as soon as it was released on DVD. I first saw it on late night TV back in the 70s, and it has aged remarkably well.

The plot concerns a group of vacationers who find themselves stranded on a remote island after their creaky vessel nearly collides with a hulking derelict freighter and is grounded. After some exploration, they find a run-down hotel and meet its sole occupant: a scarred SS commander living in exile on the island. During World War II, this man led an experimental corps of undead super soldiers who were ultimately abandoned by the Nazis because they were too difficult to control. Banished to the freighter and cast adift, the zombies are awakened and come to the island to carry out their old seek and destroy orders, forcing the castaways to fight for survival while looking for a way off the island.

This is a low budget film, shot in 1976 on 16mm film (later blown up to 35mm at the cost of some graininess) with a monaural soundtrack and a cast of unknowns. Despite this, it is outstanding, building a genuinely creepy atmosphere instead of relying on gimmicks and gore. The zombies kill their victims by drowning, and despite every death being bloodless, these scenes (particularly the standout swimming pool sequence) are eerie because of their stillness and dreamlike silence. John Carradine and the great Peter Cushing are superb in small roles, though it is a shame they are never onscreen together. Cushing in particular shows what a gifted actor can bring to a film: his accent and deft performance give his character (the SS commander) real presence despite only a few minutes of screen time. The other actors also deliver solid performances, and Brooke Adams looks terrific in a yellow bikini. But the real stars of this film are the Nazi zombies themselves. The scenes of them rising from the water and standing in formation are unforgettable, and their stalking scenes are made more effective by their slow but relentless gait. All the while, the spare but unsettling electronic score adds perfectly to the mood of the film.

If you're looking for a flashy, big-budget gorefest, you won't find it here. But if you are willing to overlook a few flaws and give a little known film a chance to shine, you should be pleased with Shock Waves. This is about as good as a B-movie can get.",1209427200,4,2388,4.708133971291866

Watching it again all these years later I realize how the mind plays tricks on you. Not so much a scary movie anymore, but still better than many other movies that came out at that time. Seeing legendary actors Peter Cushing and John Caradine together was interesting (poor Caradine suffered from an extreme case of arthritis, as we can see in this movie) and I guess neat, if you want to look at it like that. The acting wasn't horrible at all, though not Oscar-worthy. The special effects and film location were good as well, giving the audience a more believable setting and action.

The few special features (commentary, interview, trailer) were okay, though I'd liked to have seen more (deleted/alternate scenes).

My only gripe with this version of the film was the quality wasn't what I expected for a DVD release. I'd heard somewhere that this version was pulled from a copy belonging to the [director, producer? not sure]. Guess you really can't complain though.

1339946,3,B00004CJZ5,"""Shock Waves"" has been proclaimed ""the best of the Nazi zombie movies"" and bears that ringing endorsement on the DVD cover. I am inclined to agree. Although I am not normally an enormous fan of the zombie genre, the presence of both John Carradine and Peter Cushing was enough to persuade me to watch it, and I found it more enjoyable that I expected. I am a Carradine completist ever since seeing his enticing performance in ""Red Zone Cuba,"" and true to form, John lives up to his cranky reputation here.

The movie opens with some sailors recovering an insane woman in a rowboat from the open sea; the remainder of the film is told in a flashback. The body of the story commences with Captain John Carradine berating a sailor about the importance of accurate navigation on the open sea. I should mention that John looks even more like the grim specter of death warmed over than usual here, and has an unsightly beard-like protuberance on his jaw that makes him look decidedly unsavory. His boat is a leisure craft (think ""Gilligan's Island"" without the sophistication) with a few passengers including a used car salesman so annoying that you will be very eager for his encounter with the aqua-Nazis. The boat first encounters a strange yellow light and then collides with a ghost ship while under the guidance of the First Mate. The boat grounds out near and island and the occupants of the boat go ashore in a glass-bottomed rowboat (how often do you see one of those?) to look for John Carradine, who has vanished. He stays on the MIA list a very brief time when we see him float under the boat dead as a stump.

After finding an old hotel (actually a Biltmore hotel in Florida, then abandoned, but now rebuilt) once ashore, the boat occupants meet superstar number two, Peter Cushing, who like John Carradine was paid $5,000 for four days of work. Cushing explains in his creepy German accent that he was the head of a secret underwater Nazi zombie project during World War Two, and the zombies have returned. The movie is slow to start, as it is halfway over before the first zombies arrive, but when they do they are unexpectedly creepy. The scenes where they emerge from the water are very effective, and the last half of the film works quite well as a horror picture. Although the Nazis do have a weakness (they die if their goggles are removed,) this is only used against them a few times, strangely.

The psychological effects of being pursued (like ""The Most Dangerous Game"" on steroids) rend the group and fracture their cohesiveness, ultimately sealing their fate one by one. It turns out that you don't want to be in a walk-in refrigerator when a flare goes off inside it: it will drive you into the waiting arms of aqua-Nazis. Ultimately two survivors (including the insane woman recalling the story) escape, but trouble once again awaits in a genuinely creepy scene once again involving the glass-bottomed boat.

I think the film is quite good for the genre, although more screen time from Carradine and Cushing would have been welcome (and it would have been better yet if they had scenes together.) The film drags in some places, is implausible in others, and has a couple of continuity errors, but overall it will definitely please zombie and horror movie fans.

The DVD includes several extras including commentary track with Director Ken Wiederhorn and legendary B-filmmaker Fred Olen Ray, a television spot, and the original theater trailer that announces ""You are in the deep end of horror!,"" and ""The faster you run, the quicker you die!"" I give it three stars overall; the reduction stems from the limited screen exposure of the two stars, and the relatively slow start and pacing in the first half of the film.",1172188800,3,3737,4.716692189892802
1339947,5,B00004CJZ5,"Saw the trailer for this as a sophomore in high school, circa 1977. The second I saw the begoggled undead shock troops emerge from the ocean I was hooked - SHOCK WAVES has gone on to be my favorite low-budget film of all time, and I've seen a-plenty. No cannibalism here, no gore, no entrails - just bizarre, creepy atmosphere to burn and the claustrophic paranoia that is at the very heart of this classic Florida-shot mood piece. And if that ain't enough, you also have John Carradine, Peter Cushing, Luke Halpin (all grown up from his ""Flipper"" days) and the excellent Brooke Adams, who wears a bathing suit better than anyone since Julie Adams (no relation as far as I know) in CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. Blue Underground has done an excellent job with this package. In addition to enlightening, entertaining commentary from director/co-writer Ken Wiederhorn, filmmaker/photographer Fred Olen Ray and make-up designer Alan Ormsby, there is a wealth of advert media: original trailer, a Luke Halpin interview, TV and radio spots and a gallery of stills and newspaper ads for double feature and drive-in showings.

1339961,4,B00004CJZ5,"After a run down tour boat captained by a half-made John Carradine collides with a ""ghost"" ship, two vacationing couples and the boat's crew find themselves stranded on a desolate island.  After braving the jungle (and being watched by some rather pasty faced fellows clad in old Nazi SS uniforms), our party comes across the ruins of an abandoned hotel.  However, the hotel is also serving as the home of a half-crazed, German scientist (a ravaged Peter Cushing) who - after an untimely death or two - informs them that the island is also home to the last remaining outfit of Hitler's war machine.  In short, Nazi zombies!  Unfortunately for our survivors, crazy as the story might sound it's also true and soon they find themselves trapped and hunted by a seemingly unstoppable army of the Aryan undead.

Considering the competition, saying that Shock Waves is arguably the best Nazi zombie movie ever made may seem like a back handed compliment.  However, this low budget horror film deserves its reputation.  Director Ken Widerhorn rejected the over-the-top gore and easy shocks that characterized so many of the other zombie films made in the `70s and instead concentrated on creating a truly eerie atmosphere of increasing dread and hopelessness.  The film's grainy look, desolate locations, ominous electronic score, and almost relentless action creates a truly unique, dreamlike experience.  As such, it's that rare horror film that - while it may not make you scream while watching it - actually sticks in the viewer's mind long after the final credits roll.  The film's most famous scene - featuring zombie after zombie emerging from the sea and marching towards the island - is indeed one of the most truly nightmarish images in the history of horror.

The ""human"" cast is a mixed bag and the various performances range from being merely adequate to borderline histrionic.  The two best performances are delivered by Luke Halpin (who brings a low key intensity to his role as the film's hero) and the aforementioned Peter Cushing.  Indeed, Cushing's performance here might be surprising to those who remember him only as the coolly sadistic Baron Frankenstein or Grand Moff Tarkin.  Hardly slick, Cushing's crazed fugitive scientist is almost feral and he explains the zombie's origins with such fearful power that it doesn't even matter that much of what he says makes absolutely no sense.  Even if Cushing's German accent is hardly perfect, his performance is.  The film's leading lady is a young Brooke Adams who later became a minor star in the early `80s and, even if her performance is hardly a revelation, she is appealing and likeable in the role.  As for the rest, Jack Davidson has a few good scenes as an obnoxious used car salesman and John Carradine is ... well, John Carradine.  However, the film's strongest performances come, of course, from the zombies.  Still clad in their old uniforms and all possessing the same expressionless face, these zombies are never less than believable as a force of supernatural evil.  Whether suddenly materializing out of the dark shadows that dominate the film or relentlessly pursuing their prey (unlike George Romero's comical flesh eaters, these zombies are aggressive, fast, and clever), the anonymous actors playing these monsters truly make Shock Waves a truly unique and nightmarish experience in horror.",1134000000,7,3372,5.074275362318841
1339962,4,B00004CJZ5,"It can be a tricky business to revisit the favorite scary films from one's youth.  Grounded in nostalgia, they can be inexorably tied to memories of going to see the movie with a group of friends, plunking down your allowance money, and afterwards having each friend reenact their favorite terrifying scene for the entertainment of the others.  To see these films again can sometimes spoil a fond memory when the film just doesn't hold up.  Happily, I did not have that experience with ""Shock Waves,"" the 1977 cult zombie flick directed by Ken Wiederhorn.

After a brief opening scene which provides a big clue (and a spoiler) as to what the final zombies versus people outcome will be (as the story is told in an extended flashback), the movie begins aboard a small, privately-chartered boat.  Freak weather conditions, instrument failure and a nighttime close encounter with the wreckage of a derelict vessel combine to run the little boat into the reef just off a tropical island.  The crew consists of a congenitally crabby and sarcastic captain (John Carradine), his novice first mate (Luke Halpin) and a disheveled cook. The tiny passenger list is composed of an annoying used car salesman, his slightly less annoying wife, an aging beach boy type and an ingenue (Brooke Adams).  Although the characters are fairly stock, they are fleshed out by the better-than-average talent of the actors involved.  (As the group starts to unravel further into the picture, splintering off to become zombie fodder, you find yourself actually caring about the fate of several of the characters, which is not always the case in movies of this fare.)

Sometime during the night the captain goes missing and, as their boat is taking on water, the crew and passengers disembark.  The island is anything but a tropical paradise - rather, a tangled jungle of inhospitable vegetation, mangroves,  swampy water and rocky coastline.  Discovering the captain's unfortunate body, the parties set out to explore, hoping to find an alternate way off the island and soon discover a dilapidated hotel.

The sole resident of the hotel is a former S.S. Commander (Peter Cushing) who relates that he was involved in an experiment to reanimate the bodies of dead soldiers at the end of World War II.  This movie has built-in horrific villains:  Soldiers culled from the most depraved and murderous ranks of the S.S. and Wehrmacht.  Designed to be super soldiers, they killed indiscriminately, including the soldiers on their own side.  When the project was scrapped, Cushing took a ship with the remaining soldiers of the Death Corps and sank it just off the coast.  It turns out that it is this very ship which has resurfaced, crashing into the pleasure boat, and reawakening its long-dormant cargo.  The filmmakers rely heavily on Hitler's well known and barking mad interest in the occult to give the story plausibility.

These zombies vary from the shambling, disoriented undead of the wonderful Romero movies or the frenzied, berserk plague victims of ""28 Days Later.""  These are soldiers who move with purpose, in close military formation.  Their eyes hidden behind goggles, expressionless, they nevertheless appear to be assessing the situation.  They move with wordless uniform precision, disappearing silently beneath the water's surface or into the tree line, only to reappear again at a more strategic and opportune moment.  Indifferent to whether or not they are seen, these soldiers are in no hurry to take down their prey.  Neither better nor worse, these zombies are simply different and, in my opinion, uber creepy.  A remarkably eerie electronic score by Richard Einhorn serves as a sinister underpinning for the film.

The extras include a lively commentary track with the director and co-writer (Ken Wiederhorn), the makeup designer (Alan Ormsby) and the still photographer (and future filmmaker) (Fred Olen Ray), which I highly recommend.  This is a good natured and entertaining discussion, full of colorful gossip about working with Cushing and Carradine, and the technical and physical hardships of the shoot.  These men obviously like each other and have a great affection for their movie.  The filmmakers also cleared up a couple of questions for me, including a very odd scene between Halpin and Cushing.  Upon meeting, Cushing appears to turn to Halpin and spit at him for no apparent reason.  (It turns out that this impression comes from the way the camera was angled and Cushing was simply acknowledging Halpin politely with a clipped, military-style bow of his head.)  I was relieved that I hadn't imagined it or, worse still, projected bizarre and socially inappropriate behavior onto Cushing's character.

My recommendation is that you first watch the movie, and then watch the movie with the commentary track turned on.  You will find a real appreciation for these then fledgling filmmakers who managed to make a dime look like a dollar.

Even though the print has been restored, it is important to keep in mind that this is a low budget movie made in the 70's.  The film stock looks a bit degraded, giving it a slightly fuzzy quality.  There are some problems with the audio - many of the scenes containing dialogue have a hollow, tinny quality to them.  It won't pop you out of the movie, but you are aware of them.  Apparent budgetary constraints did not allow for smooth transitional shots or clear segues, and there is a great deal of scene hopping  (now they are at the hotel, now suddenly they are in the jungle), but the story is nevertheless coherent and easy to follow.  Although there is a fair amount of violence, there is virtually no blood or carnage.  If you are willing to adjust your expectations accordingly, I am sure you will enjoy this moody and atmospheric low-budget shocker classic.

Other extras on the DVD include a theatrical trailer, chapter selection, a brief contemporary interview with Luke Halpin, a photo and poster gallery, and various television and radio promotional spots.",1122854400,6,6015,5.0323232323232325
1339963,3,B00004CJZ5,"I went into Shock Waves (1977) not expecting a whole lot as I read a review on another website a long time ago that really ripped the film to shreds...which was strange because after watching the movie, it wasn't as bad as they said (and usually they're right on the money), but then I soon realized the review I had read so long ago was for a different soggy Nazi zombie movie, one called Zombie Lake (1980)...but back to this film, which was Ken Wiederhorn's (Meatballs Part II, Return of the Living Dead Part II) directorial debut, stars Brooke Adams (The Lord's of Flatbush, Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and Luke Halpin (Flipper). Also appearing is Jack Davidson (The Secret of My Succe$s), Fred Buch (Porky's II: The Next Day), John Carradine (The Wizard of Mars, Munster, Go Home), and Peter Cushing (Twins of Evil, The Creeping Flesh).

The film begins with a slow pan on an old photo of some Nazi soldiers and voice over talking about secret experiments perform by SS scientists sometime around WWII. We then cut to a fishing boat finding a dingy floating in the water, containing one bruised and bloodied individual. This sets up for the rest of the story to be told in a flashback, which eventually leads back to this point. As the flashback begins we find ourselves touring the Caribbean aboard a modest yacht, operated by the curmudgeonly Captain Ben (Carradine) and piloted by feathered haired, bell bottomed Keith (Halpin). Among the passengers are Norman (Davidson) and his wife Beverly, Chuck (Buch), who looks like a muscularly version of Richard Simmons, and Rose (Adams)...and then let's not forget the portly, unshaven, hard drinking cook...anyway, while cruising the waters the yacht has an accident with a once sunken freighter that has now come to the surface, and due to damages sustained, the crew and passengers must leave to the relative safety of a nearby deserted island...but is it deserted? Or safe? It sure ain't deserted (or safe, as we find out later) as not only do they find an old, seemingly abandoned hotel, but also an old, seemingly abandoned Nazi officer played by Peter Cushing. After they relate to him what happened (the sunken freighter rising to the surface, the accident, etc.), Cushing's character warns them they must leave immediately, but events transpire that cause them to have to stay, to which Cushing's character reveals all, specifically the once sunken freighter is inhabited by a group of undead super soldiers modified to survive in nearly any environment, and now something has awoken them. Oh yeah, we also learn that while the Nazis were successful in creating these undead warriors, the program was ultimately nixed as the soldiers became uncontrollable, probably due to the fact they were created from criminals, thugs, sadists, and pathological murderers with an innate desire violence...oh dear...shortly after this undead Nazi soldiers begin washing up on the beach, and the real fun (or nightmare, depending on your point of view) begins, sort of a The Most Dangerous Game scenario, with the passengers and crew as the prey...

Overall I enjoyed this moody nugget and was surprised to see the violence was quite minimal despite being a film populated with killer zombies. Generally these films are soaked in gore and flesh rendering, but that wasn't the case here. The focus was more on the terror being pursued by an undead menace, rather than the visceral mayhem. I wasn't sure if the inclusion of John Carradine in the film would be a good thing as his later career in films seemed to consist of very meager, pointless appearances (check out 1981's Frankenstein Island for a prime example of what I'm talking about), but here I felt he really put something into the role and sold it well, creating an interesting character (and he was in the film for all of about 20 minutes!). As far as Peter Cushing, I thought he also did well (that giant scar on his face was a nice touch), but he seemed a little underused as much of his part consisted of him running around the beach, and what not. As far as the other actors, they also performed well, helped by a decent script not populated by inane or expository lines of dialog. Brooke Adams was a good choice for the female lead and it doesn't hurt that she's really easy on the eyes and appears often in a bikini...yowsa! As far as Halprin goes, it's obvious he knows he way around a set, and his performance decent most of the time, but there were one or two scenes where he fell out of character. I also give the actors a lot of credit, as there are many scenes where they had to slog around in muddy bogs, marshes, and creeks. The scenes with the Nazi zombies emerging from the waters are probably the most memorable, and the make-up on these characters ranges from quite good (the close-up scenes) to passable (given the low budget nature of the film, I was more inclined not to get too picky about this). As far as the zombies, they seemed a little too well preserved after spending some 40 years underwater, as they were quite fleshy and mobile. And the choice of having them wear goggles worked well for me giving them an ominous appearance of what they actually were, undead, soulless creatures from the ocean (like sharks...have you ever seen a shark's eyes?) with one objective...to kill! As far as the direction, I think Wiederhorn did really well in keeping the viewer's interest by developing a real sense of suspense and in the use of some really excellent location shots, especially getting the use of that old hotel.

The widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) picture on this DVD looks good, but does show some minor flaws inherent within the source material. The Dolby Digital 2.0 comes through clear and clean. Special features include an 8 minute piece called `From Flipper to Shock Waves: A Interview with Luke Halprin, a trailer, TV and radio spots, a poster, still and production photo gallery, and an audio commentary track featuring director Wiederhorn, make-up designer Alan Ormsby and filmmaker Fred Olen Ray.

No doubt about it the fours stars I gave this are for two areas: The demented, delicious soundtrack and just the ""look"" of the sets and the zombies. Viewing this after so many years, who can forget the ""pool set""? :) Who can forget the row of disturbing Nazi Zombies just standing off the coast? Some of the images are truly classic. And who can forget that simply odd tone of the keyboards? Perfect.

What didn't seem too strong about this movie looking back at it are the performances (2.5 stars) and sadly (my biggest grievance) the Nazi's while morbid looking really weren't as formitable as I would have liked. Breaking though rotten wooded fences may have played well in the mid 70's but now seems a bit cheesy.

Basically, you have 4 travelers on a chartered boat, headed for who knows where.  The boat constantly breaks down and they eventually get lost.  The crew on the boat is clueless and the travelers are getting irate.  I love the dialogue at dinner when the travelres are pleading for the captain to turn around.

Anyway, that is the set up.  Eventually, they find an island and that is when the fun starts.  Nazi zombies...they're everywhere!!

The crew and passengers trek to a nearby island, where Cushing discloses the existence of Nazi underwater shock troopers leftover from World War II.

These guys arrive on a ship that doesn't really exist. You can probably figure out what they do afterward although the way they do it may surprise you.

This film has a very effective ""music"" score that aids the action and plot. Using electronic devices popular in the 1970s and later used to strong effect in John Carpenter movies, this film moves along slowly but effectively with the musical sequences helping unleash the action to come.

This was an unusual low budget flick in that it featured two aged stars (Cushing and John Carradine) and no other male leads of note. Adams was anything but a household name when this film was released, although she went onto a nice career in the movies.

I can't agree with those that equate this film with gory opuses such as ""Dawn of the Dead"". This movie reiles on the intensity of its musical descriptions to build anticipation of things to come that results in high suspense. It is similar to the quality that made ""Blair Witch Project"" such a success at the theaters.

This is what makes this movie worth watching almost three decades later, while the actors are dated by the long hair and odd attire prevalent in the era of Disco. It is the classic virtues of terror, anticipation and psychology that make this little movie memorable.",1093478400,8,2041,4.732394366197183
1339968,3,B00004CJZ5,"On a desolate, nondescript Caribbean island, shipwreck survivors are surprised to discover that an eccentric old German doctor resides there in an abandoned and dilapidated hotel.  They soon learn, however, that the old Teutonic medical man is more that just eccentric; he's a former S.S. officer who has continued with the experiments assigned to him by Der F&uuml;hrer.  And it isn't long before the castaways find themselves battling for survival against a corps of amphibious Nazi zombies!
This off-the-wall, low-budget horror film is just as goofy as it sounds, but it's still pretty good fun.  And believe it or not, it actually spawned a bizarre sub-genre of Nazi zombie films that includes 1981's THE LAKE OF THE LIVING DEAD (a.k.a. ZOMBIE LAKE), 1981's NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES, and 1983's THE OASIS OF THE LIVING DEAD (a.k.a. BLOODSUCKING NAZI ZOMBIES), to name just a few.  None of its cinematic offspring quite reach the guilty-pleasure or cult status of SHOCK WAVES, though.
British horror icon Peter Cushing portrays the former S.S. officer, his interpretation somewhat reminiscent of his turns as Dr. Frankenstein in the films that came out of England's Hammer Studios in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Actor John Carradine, a familiar face in American horror from the 1930s through the 1980s, appears in the minor role of the captain of the shipwrecked vessel.  Carradine's character dies early in the film, however, so the two great horror veterans never get to share any screen time.  A very unfortunate missed opportunity, as such a pairing certainly could've pushed SHOCK WAVES just a smidgen closer to notability.
Actress Brooke Adams has a prominent role as one of the shipwreck survivors.  (Indeed, the story actually unfolds like a sort of flashback as her character thinks back to the experience.)  Genre fans will recognize her from such films as the 1978 remake of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, the 1983 film version of Stephen King's THE DEAD ZONE, a cameo in Larry Cohen's 1985 horror satire THE STUFF, and many others.
The edition of SHOCK WAVES on DVD from the folks at Blue Underground is pretty good.  Considering that the film was shot on 16mm and blown up to 35mm, and taking into account the fact that the disc was digitized from the director's personal copy of the film (the only complete version known to exist, according to the DVD jacket notes), this transfer--in anamorphic widescreen at the film's original aspect ratio of 1.85:1--looks quite good.  In fact, when compared to the crappy video versions previously available, it's easy to forgive the minor filmic artifacts and the sometimes soft details.
And the DVD has some great bonus material, too.  The best is the feature commentary with director Ken Wiederhorn, make-up man Alan Ormsby, and filmmaker Fred Olen Ray. The trio are delightfully glib and candid, offering lots of humorous and informative anecdotes regarding their experiences in making low-budget horror. There's an interview with star Luke Halpin, who offers some info about his costars and some of his memories about making the film, and there are also a few radio spots, a television spot, and the film's theatrical trailer.
As far as films go, SHOCK WAVES is not the best that Blue Underground has to offer, but it's nonetheless one of those fun guilty pleasures that fans of schlocky low-budget horror will want to add to their DVD collections.",1089244800,25,3405,5.0284191829484906
1339969,4,B00004CJZ5,"Once again, William Lustig's company Blue Underground released another cult classic film on DVD. This time around, it is the 1977 zombie flick ""Shock Waves."" Zombie pictures are usually quite formulaic; some unexplainable event-a plague, virus, radiation exposure, military project gone horribly awry, or some similar disaster of epic proportions-results in the deceased rising from their graves to wreak havoc on the living. Over the top gore is the usual result from interactions between ravaging zombies and their hapless living victims. George Romero started the modern fascination with the undead in his black and white classic ""Night of the Living Dead."" More films followed from Romero and from other directors. For instance, Lucio Fulci scored points with his ultra gooey 1979 ""Zombie."" Recently, Danny Boyle of ""Trainspotting"" fame attempted to rework the formula in ""28 Days Later"" by having his creatures falling victim to an extreme rage type virus. ""Shock Waves"" is different from these films in that there is no gore, the dead have not risen en masse to destroy humanity, and these zombies are not interested in consuming their victims. Surprisingly, ""Shock Waves"" carries a 'PG' rating.
A group of vacationers on a charted boat encounter trouble when a strange weather condition sends the boat off course. The captain of the vessel (played by John Carradine) downplays the entire incident in an attempt to soothe his passengers' frayed nerves, but even he is slightly worried about what's going on. His navigator Keith (Luke Halpin) expresses concern, too, especially when the boat nearly runs into an abandoned freighter in the middle of the night. As for the passengers, only Norman (Jack Davidson) makes a lot of noise about being lost at sea. The other travelers, including Norman's wife Beverly (D.J. Sidney), Rose (Brooke Adams), and Chuck (Fred Bush) seem to take it all in stride. When that wrecked freighter floats by, however, the tension ratchets up considerably. For one thing, the two boats touched just enough to push our group's ship onto a coral reef. Stranded without a radio-Carradine's character inexplicably tossed it overboard when it would not work-the crew and passengers row to a nearby island. There they find an abandoned building inhabited by a threatening former SS commander (Peter Cushing) who tells them a weird story about the freighter now sitting on the rocks offshore.
According to this ex-military officer, he was in charge of a special division of the SS during the war called Der Toden Korps, or the Death Corps, an outfit composed of criminal elements of society turned into some sort of living/non-living soldiers by German scientists. The results were horrific, and as the war ended Cushing's character sank his vessel rather than turn these odd hybrids over to the Allies. Now, it seems the soldiers have risen from the seabed and returned to their commander. The remaining crew and passengers of the charter boat are now caught on an island populated by zombies clad in military uniforms and wearing dark goggles that have the ability to function underwater. These very creepy looking zombies for some reason wish to destroy everyone on the island. It is going to be very difficult to get off an atoll without a boat, and phones are out of the question. The people trapped in this situation will need to use their wits if they want to survive.
Nothing in this summary gives away important aspects of the movie. In fact, you will learn most of this information from the film's short introduction and from the trailer included as an extra. What the trailer will not give you is a sense of the film's creepy atmosphere and claustrophobic environment. Aside from the performances, which are all great for a low budget thriller, it is the island, the zombies, and the musical score that raises the goose bumps on your arms. Setting the story on a small tropical island completely out of touch with the rest of society imbues the film with a distinct sense of isolation, an isolation the filmmakers punch up on a routine basis with lingering shots of the vacant sea and the empty terrain of the island. Moreover, the zombies are downright ominous. This particular bunch of SS soldiers was trained to fight and live underwater, so when they arrive on the island they tend to move in and out of the ocean. There's a great shot of the Toden Korps ""waking up"" and rising out of the sea that recalls to some extent Nosferatu rising from his coffin in F.W. Murnau's classic film. And don't forget that music! A more brooding synth score would be difficult to find. It has that late 1970s and early 1980s feel to it without sounding cheesy. These three elements make the movie; so much so that I hardly missed the gore that usually accompanies any true zombie film.
The movie has a few plot problems. How, for example, is it possible for zombies to remain underwater for thirty years yet their uniforms are still intact? Too, the Rose character figures out how to stop the zombies yet no one else seems interested. The only thing mentioned is a vague reference to the SS soldiers despising the light. If I knew how to survive in a situation like this, I would tell everyone around me how to do it. Still, these problems don't hamper the overall effect of the movie. The Blue Underground DVD contains a short interview with actor Luke Halpin, a commentary track, a trailer, television and radio advertisements, and a detailed gallery. The transfer quality, although in widescreen, isn't very good. Colors are hazy and washed out with significant grain marring the picture. It's surprising to see a Blue Underground transfer of less than stellar quality. Horror fans should pick up ""Shock Waves"" in a hurry. It's a nice addition to your zombies run amuck collection.",1087344000,2,5809,4.934627170582226
1340000,4,B00004CJZ5,"During the war with Nazi Germany several Allied units reported coming across SS units that were virtual killing machines and would fight only with their barehands. It would seem that Nazi scientists experimented on the bodies of German soldiers killed in action. The individuals of course were the absolute worst sort (sadists, murderers, war criminals, etc.) and that is saying alot seeing it is Nazi Germany! These individuals were given a unit entitled Toten Korps ala the Death Corps. This experiment had some success but these quasi zombie like SS soldiers were uncontrolable and were pulled off the battlefields for further study. As the war was drawing to a conclusion the last remaining squad of Toten Korps was put to sea to await further orders which never come. The commander (Peter Cushing) scuttles the ship. The ship and her 'cargo' are condemened to the ocean floor....for now anyway!
 The movie starts off many year later with a boat load of tourists and crew who happen to ram the old wreck stirring up its 'cargo.' The crew and passengers take refuge on a nearby deserted island populated only by the former SS Commander Peter Cushing who is in hiding. Naturally the SS zombie soldiers lay siege to the island and begin picking off the crew and tourists.
 That is Shockwaves in a nutshell. The plot is great and it is what makes this movie. The acting is good for a B movie and it does create an erie atmosphere. I would recomend it because it is unique. This is not a run of the mill zombie flik with buckets of gore and pathetic special effects. This is , again, a well done B-movie! Thumbs up on this one!",1081296000,,1626,4.662020905923345

Shock Waves is one of the many fun titles they have released.  I originally saw this movie on USA when they had a show called ""Saturday Nightmares"" back in the late eighties.  This movie's always been a favorite of mine coz of it's concept and because of Peter Cushing.  Just the idea of the Nazis screwing around with science and the supernatural to make zombie soldiers is creepy-and it's not too crazy a notion to assume they actually might have tried that.  I've always like the whole stranded on an island concept for some reason.  Plus, I'm not a big fan of the water, so the fact that all this chaos emerges from the ocean adds a little depth(Get it?  Depth?  Ocean?  Water?)to the scariness for me.  Yeah, it's cheap, the acting is mediocre(except Cushing of course), it's corny at times, but it has something.  The look of the zombies, the way they move, the way they stare at people.......it's creepy.  Cushing makes too early of an exit as well as Carradine, but what can ya do?  For a ""zombie"" film there is a surprising lack of gore, but that's no big deal coz the movie goes more for the suspense angle, and succeeds most of the time.  Roger Waters samples this film for a song on his Amused To Death album.  That's bizarre.  I guess Roger Waters likes Shock Waves as well.  Could Roger Waters lead you astray?  NO!

They have no idea that the derelict ship's crew of nazi zombies has risen from their watery grave! Severe engine trouble forces our merry band to flee to a nearby island. No Gilligan here! Peter Cushing is excellent as an old nazi-in-hiding who is the only one who knows what's actually going on. This is a genuinely creepy movie. There's no nudity, no gore, and very little profanity; and I still highly recommend it! ADDED BONUS: There's an extremely annoying guy in this movie! I found myself hoping for his quick demise.

1340003,4,B00004CJZ5,"I've always been a Peter Cushing fan and a huge fan of this film. I first saw this movie on a late night horror show presenter by the name of Sammy Terry (Indiana based I think...very young at the time). I loved it from the start.....biased because of Cushing/Zombi/Nazi I'm sure. I've read some of the reviews about the screen format. From what I've read it seems as if the movie is actually Open Matte widescreen as opposed to Anamporphic like the DVD suggest. You'll see examples of this with H.P. Lovecrafts Bride Of Re-animator.....the bonus of that film was that you could still watch it full screen as an option. I've just ordered this movie and if I find my assumption incorrect I will edit my review. Later my horror fan brothers!
Edit begins:
Yep as I suspected it is Open Matte.....much like the Evil Dead widescreen. Several B-movies are shot full screen and when they are shown in the theater the projectors actually have black bars at the top and bottom of the screen to make it fit the widescreen. So in most cases it is actually being show like it was originally was at the time of theatrical release.
P.S. Please don't give this movie one star just because you are unhappy with the DVD release. Rate the film itself...and then as a footnote to your review put any good/bad info about the quality of the release. Take a look, this classic film is getting an average of 3 1/2 stars. I even read one review where the reviewer said he would watch the DVD over the VHS, however according to his rating you wouldn't think he'd ever watch it again.",1053388800,3,1558,4.48943661971831

During World War II, the [Germans] experimented with making the perfect soldiers. They began their research from ancient stories of unstoppable warriors whose power comes from the ground...these soldiers are neither alive or dead, but they are rotting and can live under water all the live-long day, so I'm leaning more towards dead.
A group of tourists cruising the islands run aground a deserted island after going into what might be the Bermuda Triangle or a similar anomally and hitting the [German's] old sunken ship.

1340005,4,B00004CJZ5,"Nobody knows this movie, except for a few true late-night horror movie addicts of years gone by.  And that's too bad, 'cause it's terrific.
Old coot boat-captain John Carradine takes a handful of passengers on a minor-league sailing trip (everyone, together: ""For a three hour tour, a three hour tour...""), all of whom suddenly find themselves in over their heads when a ""ghost ship"" rises and wrecks their boat.  Landing on a nearby seemingly-deserted isle, they discover scarred Prussian ex-Nazi Peter Cushing, who warns them to get off the island in a dinghy before it is too late.
Too late for what?  (Well, I'll tell you...)
Once upon a time, at the end of WWII, the desperate Third Reich undertook some heinous  -  but admittedly quite inventive  -  experiments.  One of these was the creation of the Death's Head division, a collection of the most vicious and pitiless sadistic psychopaths the German military and prison system had to offer, transformed by Cushing's scientific know-how into undead, non-breathing zombies.  These grotesque creatures were submerged in a ship off Cushing's island after the war, there being no further need for them  -  but now Carradine's boat has gone and woken the nasty things up.  They're not at all controllable, pretty tough to put down, and oh boy, do they love murder...
This incredible little low-budgeter works on its atmosphere and the conviction of its cast.  Brooke Adams  -  who the following year would play another great hapless heroine in the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers  -  evokes tremendous sympathy as the shell-shocked survivor who tells the tale.  Luke Halpin, of T.V.'s Flipper, is her tragic love-interest.  Carradine and Cushing, of course, are both old horror movie standbys, and it's nice to see the two of them together.
The most incredible thing about this movie is that it is all done in broad daylight.  There's lots of stalk-and-slashing, but not one bit of it at night.  Daylight terror is the hardest of all to pull off, and this movie does it in spades.  The extras  -  the undead Nazis  -  are all brilliant, and memorable.  They have a distinctly glacial look, all pasty-faced, waterlogged, gray-suited and blond-haired, with strap-on eye goggles, creepy beyond belief as they trudge along, unbreathing, along the sea bottom.  They never speak, never show any expression, and in general behave like homicidally programmed robots  -  brutally efficient, without any emotion, their overall effect enhanced by a chilly electronic score soundtrack.
Get Ginger and Marianne to safety, and watch this shuddery gem.  (""Skipper - !""  ""Little Buddy - !"")",1042070400,5,2635,5.041763341067285

It is true that if you have never seen the original full-frame print to compare this ""widescreen"" DVD to, you may never miss the 1/3 of the image you are missing on this DVD. People just need to be aware that simply because this DVD is ""widescreen"" does not mean that you are getting all of what the director filmed. In this case you get less.

1340007,3,B00004CJZ5,"I purchased this DVD with much anticipation as I had read so many good reviews.  After all, how can you go wrong with Nazi zombies?  What I was treated to was a creepy film reminiscent of late hammer productions.  As far as the story goes, a group of travelers become stranded on an island whose only inhabitant is none other than Peter Cushing.  Cushing turns in his usual masterful performance as a Nazi commander in charge of the sea bearing arm of &#147;death soldiers&#148; created near the end of WWII.  Cushing sent his men to the bottom of the sea at the war&#146;s end and entered exile.  John Carradine turns in a good, but all too short performance as the captain of the doomed tourist ship.  The zombies awaken inexplicitly and are on the loose.  The film makes use of atmosphere instead of gore to induce chills in the viewer.  The film is not without its flaws.  The Nazi&#146;s for example rise from the bottom of the sea after 30+ years with nicely pressed uniforms.  Torn and decayed uniforms would have been a nicer touch.  This is perhaps a minor point.  The quality of the DVD leaves a little to be desired.  The colors are a bit washed out and scratches, artifacts, etc. are visible, particularly in the darker scenes.  I&#146;m sure the quality is still better than could be had on VHS.  The movie gets 3 stars, but the DVD presentation would get 2 stars.  I couldn&#146;t help but think of how good a modern day remake by the likes of John Carpenter could be.

1340008,3,B00004CJZ5,"First, let me say that I like the 1975 horror flick ""Shock Waves."" Secondly, it must be the only film in history that has Peter Cushing, John Carradine, Brooke Adams AND scuba Nazis. After years of struggling to find this little known creepfest on video, I am pleased to see it has finally been released on DVD.
What I noticed after watching this film again recently (...), was how reliant ""Shock Waves"" was on mood and atmosphere to create its horror. Director Ken Wiederhorn has draped his film with creepy images of gothic mansions and decaying laboratories and, of course, hungover android Nazis standing on the ocean horizon, ready to destroy every living thing within sight.
Unlucky travelers, among them Brooke Adams and Fred Buch (?!), are in the wrong place at the wrong time when they are stranded on an island whose only inhabitant seems to be Peter Cushing in an old dark house. Van Helsing he's not. In fact, Ol' Pete's a former SS scientist who created a race of underwater-breathing Nazi androids for use as WW II submarine commanders. Naturally, these Aryan zombies are accidently released into what is already is very weird environment. Complete with tattered SS uniforms, black jack boots and dark sunglasses, these...scuba soldiers proceed to crush every thing in their path, including one especially artificial-looking shark.
But the mood is the key, and this flick thrives on a foreboding, ominous tone. In ""Shock Waves,"" the trees are covered with hanging moss (this film must take place off the coast of the southern United States), walls are streaked with mold and cobwebs, the wind is constantly blowing, odd noises can be heard in the darkness, and then you have a manic John Carradine spouting gibberish as if he were still acting out the opening scene in ""The Grapes of Wrath.""
When watching ""Shock Waves"" today, I am reminded of many of those terrible Italian zombie films from the same period, in which unlucky travelers are stranded on an island and soon become the appetizers of the hungry undead. This film, thankfully, is not as graphically violent as those repulsive extravaganzas. In fact, ""Shock Waves"" relies far more on suspense and mood than violence.
If ever a film was deserving of cult status, the unique and utterly bizarre ""Shock Waves"" certainly is. For those not yet acquainted with its eerie allure, this Nazi-zombie-shocker will be a pleasant surprise.",1035072000,78,2401,4.960297766749379

7920197,2,B00004CJZ5,"Shock Waves should be great. Peter Cushing! Nazi zombies! Richard Einhorn on synth! And just look at the original poster artwork! But alas, what should have been an amazing b-movie romp instead left me throughly disappointed. There are a few interesting visuals, but overall Shock Waves is boring and entirely forgettable.

First off, the good. The music, slow pacing, and lower film and audio quality also give the movie an eerie quality that is sort of unique. The zombies also have a great style, especially when rising all Capt. Willard style out from the water. And while the film does not have much in the way of gore or blood, watching a zombie drag someone underwater and then seeing the surface go still is effectively chilling.

Everything else is not so great. There's really not much in the way of plot or characters to speak of, and Peter Cushing is entirely wasted in his role. The other character's have zero personality and their motivations are never clear. The film is not very well edited either, with odd jumps and transitions, and weird shifts in how each of the characters behaves scene to scene.

For horror, the film relies on the same few scares throughout: foreboding scene with foreboding synth music playing, zombies looking blankly at people from a distance or slowly chasing them, and zombies emerging from the water to grab someone. The zombies are revealed about 30 minutes into the film and there's never much more to them beyond the initial reveal. This repetition ruins the eerie atmosphere the early film built up and turns the entire thing into a slog.

My biggest problem though with the film is tone. For a film about underwater Nazi zombies, Shock Waves sure does take itself seriously. I feel it must have really been trying to be a horror film and scare you, but it just doesn't have what it takes. The semi-serious tone reminds me of 50s horror films in many ways actually, although Shock Waves is not nearly as unintentionally comical as some of those effort.

Shock Waves should have been an unabashed exploitation film plain and simple. And it could have been an amazing one, if only the director had embraced a more over-the-top and self-aware tone. Instead, it's just another disposable 70s horror film. I don't see much reason for a modern viewer to go back and seek this one out.",1494892800,2,2329,4.769230769230769
7920198,4,B00004CJZ5,"Anyone who wants proof that a zombie movie need not be gory to be scary and thrilling need look no further than here.

Rated a mere PG for theatres, Shock Waves is still effectively creepy and unsettling for adults, with its Nazi zombies stalking and drowning people, and their zippy little goggles being their only weak point!

These zombies are no cannibals. They are Nazi creations simply programmed to kill and that's what they aim to do, then move on to the next kill. Their relentless stalking and drowning of victims on a remote island provides all the suspense that is needed here, and the direction effectively works with this simple horror premise to unnerve its audience.

The eerie music is particularly good in this, sounding like a group of ghostly  musicians is playing something underwater with a slow synthesizer for accompaniment, it plays throughout the film in an unsettling way that adds to the atmosphere of uncertain dread.

The Nazi zombies also look great. Ranging from pale and washed-out to rotten-looking and monstrous depending on their decomposition state, most of them carry themselves with a real Nazi-like bearing that makes them doubly disturbing.

An excellent horror-movie cast in a remote tropical setting add to the essential B-movie creepout feel of the whole film, and the down-to-earth dialogue, broken only by the excellent Peter Cushing's explanation speeches, adds a realistic flavor.

Try this one out and see if, even as you have a ""good laugh"" with some aspects of it, you don't find yourself in suspense as to others. If it worked on a lifelong horrorhead and ""gorehound"" like me then I would suppose it would work on most anyone!",1491696000,,1678,4.9714285714285715
