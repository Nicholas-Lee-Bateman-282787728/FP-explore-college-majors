7828271,5,630263976X,"'A Way to Escape the Ghetto' stands as one of the strongest Blues videos for documentary and entertainment value. It's up there with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-American-Folk-Blues-Festival-1962-1966/dp/B0000AYL2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The American Folk Blues Festival 1962-1966</a>."" It is the second part of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-the-Blacks-into-the-Blues/dp/6302639840/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of the Blacks into the Blues</a>."" Not so much a history, this film is an exploration of Blues music. It is remarkable in that most Blues documentaries, like Martin Scorsese's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blues/dp/B0000CBHOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blues</a>,"" include historical footage but are ultimately limited in being a creation of the present that seeks to document something that happened long ago. In contrast, this film goes back to 1973. Much as there is an aesthetic rift between Classic and Modern Rock, the same can be said for the Blues. Along these lines, French film director Robert Manthoulis filmed electric and acoustic Blues greats back in the day. 'A Way to Escape the Ghetto' features a minimal amount of narration and focuses on musicians' stories and performances. Things kick off with an amazing live performance by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buddy-Guy-and-Junior-Wells/dp/B0000032E9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buddy Guy and Junior Wells</a>. The guys play with their band in front of a Black audience in a small Chicago club. For anybody familiar with their many wonderful albums, the spectacular performance is deeply rewarding. Next up is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Willie-Dixon/dp/B0012GMWCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Willie Dixon</a>. While the segment shows Dixon playing bass, it emphasizes his role as a producer and publisher. Indeed, the legend sits comfortably at the helm of his 'Blues Factory.' Between segments, a street musician is shown singing and playing a washboard bass on the sidewalk. Next up is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arthur-Big-Boy-Crudup/dp/B00007KFS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arthur 'Big Boy' Crudup</a>. Not only does he sounds great, the location of the shoot emphasizes the poverty that the Blues grew out of. We leave electric Blues and head back in time as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brownie-McGhee-and-Sonny-Terry/dp/B00000JHBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry</a>&nbsp;represent Piedmont Blues. The sermon of a rural Baptist preacher is the introduction to a conversation of the Blues vs. the church. They guys talk about the origins of the suffering that inspired them to channel their pain through the Blues. The next segment documents the new Blues movement that has even garnered White listeners. Introducing the up-and-coming musician known as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B-B-King/dp/B000002P72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B.B. King</a>. He is first shown playing at a small club and then at a college in Santa Barbara. King gives his mini-biography in a San Francisco elevator. His live footage is spellbinding. The film returns to rural America with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mance-Lipscomb/dp/B0000001FH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mance Lipscomb</a>. The tenant farmer plays the original Blues version of C.C. Rider and for comparison sake, he plays the way that the day's rock and rollers performed it. B.B. King is revisited. The Bluesman describes how&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Rolling-Stones/dp/B0039TD7RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Rolling Stones</a>&nbsp;played an important role in the day's Blues revival. The live segments are again phenomenal. It is fascinating to see the hippies grooving to his music. As with the rest of ""Out of the Blacks Into the Blues,"" there's much delight to be had in the time capsule value of observing the clothes people wore, the cars on the road and seeing what Americans had in their living rooms in 1973. Afterwards, a Blues band is shown at Rikers Island in New York City. The prisoners discuss their backgrounds and how they wound up in the slammer. The group sounds fantastic! 'A Way to Escape the Ghetto' closes with a smokin' performance by B.B. King. Not only is this second part of ""Out of the Blacks into the Blues"" the strongest half, it is arguably the best Blues documentary. It shows the Blues from within a golden age. It is well-rounded as the film offers a balance of electric and acoustic Blues. It shows legends and obscure greats. This program begs to be digitally mastered and brought back into distribution. 'A Way to Escape the Ghetto' is one of the best ways to understand what the Blues is all about.",1334793600,,5072,6.756880733944954
7828272,5,630263976X,"I highly recommend this film.  It is very well made and does an excellent job of documenting the state of the blues in the US in the early 1970s.  Footage of Junior Wells and Buddy Guy opens the film.  Also some excellent footage of Arthur Big Boy Cruddup.  Somewhat humorously the European film makers thought his song was called ""Chain and Lock on the Door"" when it is really ""Changed the Lock on the Door.""  Had I not known better (due to hearing other versions) I would easily have made the same mistake.  Too bad more documentarians were not interested in chronicaling the vital music at the time.  Other featured artists include Brownie McGhee & Sonny Terry and Mance Lipscombe.",1332028800,,684,4.65
