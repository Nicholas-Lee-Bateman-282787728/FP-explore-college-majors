8295634,2,B001DZOCKA,"Very disappointed Rona did not include her interview with Ann-Margret. In 1975, Rona hosted a special titled ""Rona Looks At Liza, Cher, Raquel and Ann-Margret"". Sadly, they were not included in this release.",1255564800,2,207,5.303030303030303
8295635,5,B001DZOCKA,"I don't remember these television specials but I do remember my mom reading ""Rona Barrett's Hollywood"" magazine back in the day. For those who are unfamiliar with Barrett, she was the celebrity interviewer back in the 70s and 80s before Barbara Walters took over that title, and had her own gossip magazine and column.

The RONA BARRETT'S HOLLYWOOD: NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH DVD is a nostalgic look at the top stars during the 70s, some who are still around today. I was really interested in the Donna Summer interview because they're so rare and that's why I bought this DVD. But the other interviews are intriguing as well.

Running at 01-hour and 31-minutes, the DVD is short and sweet. Barrett (in the present time) introduces each interview and concludes each with a tidbit of info on ""where are they now.""

Each interview runs between 5-9-minutes, give or take, and the quality is a little grainy but doesn't disrupt viewing pleasure. There's ""interview/chapter selection"" and ""play-all"" feature so you can go right to your favorite star or watch the entire show.

Also included is a bonus 9-minute featurette narrated by Rona Barrett on her career and includes still photos with some very famous celebrities and archival footage of Hollywood. And one-dollar from every sale of the DVD goes to help the ""Rona Barrett Foundation For The Elderly Poor.""

The highlight interviews--though all are good--are Donna Summer, Robin Williams, Cher, Carol Burnett, and Burt Reynolds. You also get to see a young John Travolta talking about his career after riding high on the success of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease.""",1240876800,3,1615,5.0111940298507465
8295636,5,B001DZOCKA,"Rona Barrett is a true pioneer and legend in the realm of Hollywood reporting. I remember watching her on ""Good Morning, America"" and later ""Today"" and buying her popular magazines as well...because she always got the scoop and reported on facts and the truth (thus, the name of this DVD - and hope there's more to come too). This dvd highlights some great interviews with some great personalities. It's also nice to know that the sales of this dvd support her foundation which assists the elderly poor.",1237852800,8,503,4.793103448275862
8295637,3,B001DZOCKA,"I remember Rona's big specials, and I remember the one with Cher.  This isn't the same footage that aired with the original.  At the start of the original footage, it showed Rona going thru the gates of Cher's mansion, driving up to the front door.  I enjoyed the interviews with Carol Burnett and Donna Summer.  Both women consistent throughout their careers. Looking back at what they said then, and how the live now, very impressive.  I imagine this is being test marketed for future DVD's - so I expect more of the same interviews to appear on those as well?  Either way I much prefer Rona's persona as opposed to Barbara Walters.",1235001600,4,634,4.616071428571429
8295638,5,B001DZOCKA,Im looking forward to purchasing this dvd of interviews of celebrities from the 1970's. Rona Barrett was a entertainment reporter in the 70's and had several celebrity gossip magazines and interview shows. I only hope they release more volumes of her interviews in the future. Anyone fans of the 70's should purchase this dvd,1229126400,6,325,5.037037037037037
