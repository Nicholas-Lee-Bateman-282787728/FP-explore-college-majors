7003053,5,B00T9G67TO,"Blending fact and speculation and lasting a daunting-in-theory-but-nimble-in-motion three hours, director Dominik Graf's Beloved Sisters is an intricate and sumptuous romantic drama set in Germany in the last two decades of the 1700s.  Germany put the film forth for Academy Award consideration, but it sadly failed to garner a nomination for the foreign-film prize earlier this month.  The story turns on Friedrich Schiller (Florian Stetter), the dramatist, poet, and theorist remembered as an influential contemporary of Goethe, and his relationship with the Lengefeld sisters, one of whom became his wife (Charlotte, played by Henriette Confurius) and the other his first biographer (Caroline, played by the spectacular Hannah Herzsprung).  They engage in an agreed-upon love triangle under the collective noses of polite society, including a stern courtier (Andreas Pietschmann) Caroline previously wed to save her family from destitution, but their oath is tested in various ways over time.  By emphasizing the trio as a tempestuous unit rather than just Friedrich Schiller himself, Beloved Sisters dodges and subverts the lionizing, myopic clichs of a typical Great Man biopic.  It gestures toward his achievements and significance without becoming a lavish tribute to him.

The space provided by the epic length is used to bring the period to particularly vivid life, from its constrictive customs and gender roles to the various arenas of cultural and political upheaval, including the frequently referenced revolutionary violence in nearby France.  Other colorful characters, such as lady-in-waiting/Goethe muse Mrs. von Stein (Maja Maranow) and the sisters' mother (played by Claudia Messner as a scene-stealing paragon of pragmatism-laced sensitivity), are given the chance to come to the fore, too, and convey the rhythm and texture of the larger world beyond the focused intensity of the secret universe inhabited by Caroline, Charlotte, and Friedrich.

The film has enormous fun with the system of code they devise for their notes and an overarching fascination with penmanship and epistolary interaction in general, with characters often reciting the content of their dispatches as aching soliloquies to the camera.  It also contains instances of genuine sensual flair.  One finds the sisters quietly warming a nude, shivering Friedrich after he saves a girl from drowning.  They hold themselves against him tightly in an isolated wood, clearly at once scared and turned on by the moment's seclusion and intimacy.  It is the type of subtle, chaste-yet-naughty moment which can be far sexier than more overt and unimaginative cinematic depictions of fleshly pleasure.",1426982400,51,2681,5.592592592592593
7003054,3,B00T9G67TO,A little bit odd but I stuck with it.  It was sometimes difficult reading the subtitles.  I was also having trouble streaming it and it kept stopping to reboot telling me that I didn't have enough bandwidth to play it.,1487721600,,218,4.425
7003055,3,B00T9G67TO,"At the center of this story are two sisters who are inseparable. One is already married when the film begins. It becomes clear that she married in order to help her mother and sister to live in comfort. The younger sister goes away to live with her aunt and meets an ""unsuitable"" young man. He has ""no fortune and no prospects."" From here there are unexpected turns in the story. The reason I rate it at 3 stars, is that the story is prolonged and at times unclear as to how a choice in life came to be.",1484956800,,503,4.142857142857143

7003065,1,B00T9G67TO,"While this is a beautifully filmed historical drama of 18th century Germany, it is hardly one for American audiences. The plot deals with Germany's great poet-dramatist Friedrich Schiller and the triangle that ensues when he becomes involved with two sisters, one of whom marries him. How close this hews to historical reality I don't know, but the film moves at an agonizingly  turgid and slow tempo,  despite its beauties . The problem is, American audiences simply know nothing about Schiller , or the heady sacrifices of German 18th century idealistic love relationships and, I fear, are even less interested. Acting is good, but I finally got bored by it all.",1475020800,,664,5.027272727272727

While we had not heard of his life as depicted in this wonderful story, the movie is filled with real names and incidents.  Acting was wonderful, and often it was amusing to see the 'enlightening' period meeting the good old days.  Sweet, tender and thoroughly entertaining was our reaction.",1474416000,,372,4.967741935483871

7003075,4,B00T9G67TO,"It was a fun period piece.  I love the European settings and costumes, but really this film, to me, didn't portray much about Schiller's poetic genius.  Beehoven was so moved by Schiller's poem 'Ode To Joy', that he wrote the 9th Symphony for it even though he (Beethoven) was ill and totally deaf.  THAT is inspiration.  I didn't see that Schiller in this film.  The film's Schiller was selfish, manipulative, inept.  He was a known poet in his time, but we just don't see his public life at all.  Just the sexually manipulative woman user Schiller.  OK.  Maybe he was, but give me the reason why people put up with him.
The younger sister married him so the older sister--in an arranged, loveless marriage-- could have him, too.  That's quite a sister!  Of course it didn't end well.  Anyway---if you like costumers like I do.  If you like to see films about poets and artists that our 21st century world has almost forgotten, then this is for you.
This is during the Napoleonic era.  That war was the worst war the modern world had seen thus far.  Napoleon inspired fear, awe, admiration, hatred, and large bodies of work in the art world.  He heralded a new world order.  Schiller and Beethoven and many others reacted to those momentous times in their art.  You don't see much of that social upheaval in this film, either.  Just 2 dizty sisters in love with a poet.",1474156800,5,1370,4.563786008230453

I also feel as though certain events and incidents in Schiller's life were grossly contorted to make the film more dramatic.  For instance, his death scene - way, way over the top.  Actually, Schiller died five years later.  Also, the story line seemed too choppy, and the characters' motivation was lacking.

The acting is excellent: Hannah Herszsprung, as the unhappily but lucratively married Caroline von Beulwitz; Henriette Confurius, as the the shy younger sister Charlotte von Lengefeld; and Florian Stetter, as the young Schiller, are all superb.

7003313,5,B00T9G67TO,"4 1/2 STARS -- PARTIALLY FICTIONALIZED, BUT BEAUTIFULLY FILMED TALE ---- ***IN GERMAN WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES (Not noted on Prime Streaming)

A NOTE FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR: This movie is beautiful and well done, but it does not have an American style pacing.  It will seem slow to some as you may read in some reviews.  I am a fan of the movie and I don't mind subtitles, but I also realize it is not for everyone.  My intent is to help both those who will enjoy, and those who will not enjoy this film by giving description and allowing each reader to decide themselves.  It is a different kind of romance and also not designed to be titillating despite the shared relationship.

BRIEF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE INCLUDED AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW

Though this movie can be described in part as a historical biopic of Friedrich Schiller, it is really far more about two sisters Charlotte and Caroline Von Lengefeld, and their relationship (or possible relationship) with Friedrich Schiller.  This is not a love triangle in the negative sense of the word.  Each of these characters are genuinely devoted to each other.  Where the sisters are two of the three sides of this strong bond, they are also the major focus of the film.  On the surface, it is a tale of relationships and their struggles.  Underneath, there is deep symbolism of Schiller's ideals (Weimar Classicism).  Indeed, the backdrop of Schiller's life and ideas acts as a subtext or skeleton around which the relationship is built and even explains how they can function the way they do to some extent.  For those who just want to enjoy a unique period tale, you can relax and just enjoy without overthinking this one as long as you don't need a Hollywood pace.  If you are interested in Schiller and Wolfgang Von Goethe,  their statesmanship, or Weimar Classicist philosophy in general, you may find added depth.  If you hate subtitles and long movies, this may not meet your tastes.  It can be very sensual, but purposefully NOT titillating.  There is brief nudity.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  1787 Pre-Unified Germany.  Charlotte Von Lengenfeld (Henriette Confurious) belongs to a family of lower nobility that has lost much of it's wealth prior to and after her father's death.  Now as a young woman, Charlotte travels from her home in Rudolstadt to Weimar, capital of the Duchy of Saxony to live with her godmother Frau Von Stein.  This in hopes of being introduced at the Ducal Court to find a match of high noble standing and wealth.  Charlotte's older sister Caroline (Hannah Herzsprung) has already been married to Friedrich von Beulwitz in a marriage of convenience to bolster family finances.  Charlotte and Caroline are absolutely devoted to each other.  Charlotte finds that court life does not suit her well and she lacks enthusiasm.  Her potential suitors begin to dwindle.  One day she is called to the window of Frau Von Stein's home by a young man who asks directions.  This young man happens to be Friedrich Schiller (Florian Stetter) who is still just an impoverished poet at that time.  They engage in a witty tete-a-tete, but do not meet again for a short time.  These two will be brought together again with the help of Charlotte's sister and Schiller moves to be near Charlotte as they spend time together.  Caroline is with them, first as a sort of chaperone, but then as genuine close friends.  As the movie puts it, they go through symbolic phases of relationship called ""Irony"", ""recognition of true feelings"" (but perhaps unspoken), then ""irredeemable honesty"" (mutual acknowledgement by all three).  This is the movie's setup for what will be a life of devotion and struggle.  The movie also deals briefly with Schiller's association with Wolfgang Von Goethe, but is not entirely accurate nor complete in that area.

ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS:  The cinematography is gorgeous as it explores the countryside and beautiful state homes.  The actors are fantastic and I have to say both Hannah and Henriette are wonderful and stunning.  As I said before, you don't have to be into the historical and philosophical aspects to enjoy this film.  However, the relationship depicted is also very emblematic of schiller's own philosophical works such as the term ""Beautiful Soul"" in which reason and sensuousness, duty and inclination coincide.  In the movie, Schiller even calls Caroline ""wisdom"" and Charlotte ""ardor"".  Together they make up a whole that is natural for them.  A whole is not defined as perfection though, and this relationship has its troubles.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:  There is some evidence to support the idea of a relationship between Schiller and both sisters.  However, I understand it is still debated today.  I also believe the way Charlotte and Friedrich meet is altered in the movie for a more romantic feeling.  For those not familiar, Friedrich Schiller, along with Wolfgang Von Goethe, were leading members of the Weimar Classicist movement.  Schiller has been called poet to the American Revolution and his works on political and personal freedom were some inspiration during the French Revolution.  The Weimar Cassicist movement helped shape many ideals in the modern German state in the nearly 100 years before it was actually realized.  The periodical ""Die Horen"" (you see being published on printing presses in this film) included works of philosophy, history, and fiction centered around their ideals.  It featured many female authors.  Though not shown in this film, Charlotte also wrote works like Caroline, but they were not published until after her death.  Charlotte Von Stein (Frau Von Stein the godmother), was also a real character who was even the sometimes love interest of Goethe.  She was at the center of Weimar Classicist society and a lady in waiting at the Weimar court.",1431475200,43,5801,4.972972972972973

I am an ardent fan of foreign period pieces with the topic of artists but this too long epic was not easy to follow. The main fault is the often transparent subtitles! And this was a heavy dialogue movie. I am a fast reader and used to subtitles but this was frustrating. I confess I was sleepy going in so let the dreamlike quality of the photography and gorgeous sets and costumes wash over me. Now to the story...a fascinating portrayal of fierce loyalty and love between the sisters Caroline and Charlotte Lengefeld as they entangle themselves romantically with the poet Friedrich Schiller. Although the film cleverly uses the copious letters between the three and the story may be lifted from Caroline's novel ""Agnes von Lilien"", I am not sold on the historical acuracy. Frustrating to never see the oft-mentioned towering figure of Goethe. (Or did I sleep thorugh that?) If you want to know more about Schiller, the writer, this will disappoint.
