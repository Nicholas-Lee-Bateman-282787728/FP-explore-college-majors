8324956,4,B000A2VLOW,"I'm just going to cut to the chase and tell you what's on this dvd so that you can decide if you want it or not. First of all, this ""2 pack"" is the Cartoon Explosion Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 dvds in one nice box set. This is good if you want to get all 3 volumes of this series and it will probably be a lot cheaper to just buy this and then Vol. 3. Overall, this is a very nice collection, especially if you love Looney Tunes and Tex Avery.

The quality is not on par with something like Looney Tunes Golden Collection and I don't think it's fair to compare this with something like that. If you want nice, crystal clear quality, then you should just buy LTGC or Platinum Collection. Quality is much better than other public domain cartoon collections that I've seen.

My only problem with these dvds is that they contain censored cartoons. I recommend the ""Cartoon Craze"" dvd series. Those are uncut.

Disc 1 (Volume 1), Unless otherwise noted, these are all Looney Tunes:

Fresh Hare (censored version)
the Wabbit Who Came to Supper
the Wacky Wabbit
Yankee Doodle Daffy
Daffy and the Dinosaur
the Unruly Hare (Um, I don't think this is really a public domain cartoon, but it's on this dvd anyway, so yay!)
Corny Concerto
Porky's Garden
Daffy's Southern Exposure (This version has the beginning cut. It is the colorized version. I'd try to find one that's B+W because those are usually uncut.)
Daffy Duckaroo
Porky's Bear Facts
Dog Gone Tired (MGM Tex Avery cartoon! OMG! :D )
Jerky Turkey (MGM Tex Avery)
Porky's Midnight Matinee

Disc 2/Volume 2:

Looney Tunes:
the Henpecked Duck (This is hard to find on dvd nowadays.)
a Coy Decoy
Porky's Pooch
Porky's Prize Pony
Robinson Caruso Jr.
We the Animals Squeak!
Porky's Ant

Popeye (I don't know that much about Popeye cartoons, so I can't tell you if these are censored or not. I don't think Popeye cartoons had that much of a problem with that? If you know that politically incorrect stuff was taken out of Popeye cartoons, then it would be safe to assume that they have been taken out of these as well.):
A Haul in One
I Don't Scare
Insect to Injury
the Nearlyweds
Out to Punch
Parlez-Vous Woo
Patriotic Popeye
I'm in the Army Now

Thanks for reading my review! Happy cartoon watching!",1423180800,,2232,4.493827160493828
8324957,4,B000A2VLOW,"Being a true fan of vintage animation, I can't recommend this set too highly for collectors. Most of the cartoons with Porky Pig and Daffy Duck that were originally in black-and white are shown on this DVD set as hand-drawn/colorized versions from 1968.

This problem doesn't bother me too much, though, but there's another problem that DOES: some of the cartoons on the set, namely ""Fresh Hare"" and ""Daffy's Southern Exposure"" (both of which are Looney Tunes cartoons from 1942, despite that ""Daffy's Southern Exposure"" is shown as its 1968 version) are censored: On ""Fresh Hare"", the scene near the end of the cartoon where Bugs sings ""Dixie"" is shortened, and on ""Daffy's Southern Exposure"", they cut out about the first 2 minutes where Daffy brags about hogging the lake to himself and then hits his head on ice after trying to dive into the lake.

Not that there isn't anything GOOD about this set, though. The cartoon selections are GREAT, especially ""Doggone Tired"" on Disc 1, where a paranoid rabbit tries to distract a sleepy dog who has intentions of killing the rabbit in the morning.

If you're not TOO strict of a collector and just want to enjoy and relax to vintage animation, then this set is what you want. Just remember (since this set was released by a PD company) not to expect PROFESSIONAL quality or rely on the ""Digitally Remastered"" disclaimer on the back- in short, the quality of the cartoons varies from very good to okay. Still, don't be afraid to buy this set-go right ahead!",1299801600,,1504,4.754789272030651
