7924086,2,B00004UEYG,"I first heard about this film many years ago in some catalog that came in the mail. They hinted that it was a sequel to ""Braveheart"". It is not. At the time I did not have the spendable income to buy the VHS, but I might have as it proved to be an extremely rare film. The only DVD version appears not to play on U.S. players. The film which appears to have been made for Scottish TV, tells how Robert the Bruce won Scotland's independence from England. A narrator would have greatly improved this film, for it is very hard to understand in parts and hard to tell the Scots from the English. The actor portraying Robert the Bruce looks more like a peasant than a royal figure, and that may be more accurate than the Mel Gibson film. There are depictions of extreme violence in this film that may be too much for children. If you know Scottish history better than I, you may like this and be able to follow the events better than I did.",1400457600,7,935,4.229050279329609
