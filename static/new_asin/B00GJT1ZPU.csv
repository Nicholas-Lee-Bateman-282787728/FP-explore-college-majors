6080747,5,B00GJT1ZPU,"As a long time Danny Kaye fan, I was disappointed when most of the classic movies (especially A Song Is Born) that he starred in had not made it to DVD.  In the last few years I have had felt pangs of nostalgia, remembering movies and actors that my grandfather introduced me to.  Danny Kaye was one of the actors/entertainers that stood out in my mind, not only from Hans Christian Anderson, White Christmas (with Bing Crosby), The Court Jester and The Inspector General, but from three of the movies found in this collection.
When I found this collection, I knew I had to grab it.  It been fun to go back and relive moments of nostalgia, and to remember that even the old movies can be really entertaining.",1488412800,3,708,4.4728682170542635

6080759,5,B00GJT1ZPU,"What a fantastic find.  Very excited to have gotten this.

A year ago, I wanted to get my girl a Danny Kaye movie ""A Song Is Born"" for Christmas, as she'd always wanted that movie on DVD.  I about fell over when I saw just how much that was going to cost.  So, at that time, I opted for some really nice chinaware and a few other items on her wish list.  nI am glad that I did.  This new release has not only ""A Song Is Born"" but a total of 4 Danny Kaye movies at a fraction of the price that single DVD would have cost me a year ago.  A complete steal of a bargain.  This purchase made me a hero this past Christmas.  The image and sound quality is very good for a film of this age.

As the description says, this is made using DVD-R Recordable media upon demand when ordering, and I would say that the quality is very consistent with that kind of media.  There were no defects, or artifacts that might result from inferior digital transfer, no freezes or interruptions.  As a whole it was exactly what I was hoping for.  She was beyond thrilled.  A grown woman squealing in joy, is a beautiful thing!

Keep in mind that movies made from the 40s had far different production qality than today, but that adds to the charm I think, and it's still thoroughly enjoyable.

Did I mention that just one of his movies last year cost way more than this box set?  I did?  Well, I'm going to say it again.  One of those times where I am glad I waited.  Can you tell how happy I am?

I hope that this review gives you the information that you are looking for to make an informed purchase decision.",1454371200,,1586,4.117647058823529

6080768,5,B00GJT1ZPU,"These are good, classic, clean movies that the whole family can watch. I had seen three of them before, Wonder Man, The Kid from Brooklyn, and A Song is Born, and they were still fun to watch. Up in Arms was a fun new movie to watch, but perhaps not of as great quality as the other three. A Song is Born not only is very entertaining as a musical version of an earlier-made movie, but it also provides my generation and future generations with a great musical education of those musicians and songs of the mid-Twentieth century as it showcases many of those famous musicians--Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Mel Powell, and others I hadn't even heard of before. Wonder Man is a comic and sometimes tense movie based on the fantastic idea of a man's twin ghost haunting him until he helps him catch his kill and put him behind bars. The Kid from Brooklyn is a comical story of a clumsy milkman who no one takes seriously until he is mistaken to have knocked out a boxing champ. What's fun about these three movies is that they all pair Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo together, and the pair make a great comic team (not to mention their apparent chemistry together).",1436918400,5,1177,4.5046728971962615

6080777,4,B00GJT1ZPU,"This 4-DVD set from Warner Archives contains four of comedian Danny Kaye's films that were produced by maverick producer Samuel Goldwyn and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures. NOTE: Goldwyn had no connection with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), despite the similarity in name; he had sold his previous film company, Goldwyn Pictures, sometime before it merged with Metro Pictures and Louis B. Mayer Pictures to form MGM.

Disc 1: UP IN ARMS (1944): This was Kaye's feature-film debut, in which he plays a hypochondriac who is drafted into the Army. The military fraternization rules put a cramp into his love life, but in the end, he becomes a war hero by doing an impersonation of the commanding officer, tricking the Japanese soldiers, who had been holding him captive, into surrendering to the Americans. The supporting cast includes Dana Andrews, Constance Dowling, and Dinah Shore. This is the weakest of the four films. Three stars.

Disc 2: WONDER MAN (1945): In 2003, I purchased this film on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS-tape/dp/6302227178/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS tape</a>, having seen it on television several times, and have always enjoyed it. Kaye plays a dual role, as nightclub entertainer Buster Dingle (a.k.a. Buzzy Bellew) and his bookworm brother Edwin, who haven't seen each other in years. When Buzzy is called to testify in a murder trial, he is bumped off by the mob and his body is dumped in the river; Buzzy's ghost then enlists Edwin to take his place until the trial is over by inserting himself into Edwin's body at various intervals. This creates a complication, because Buzzy was engaged to nightclub dancer Midge Mallon (Vera-Ellen), while Edwin is in love with librarian Ellen Shanley (Virginia Mayo). In the end, things work out fine, as the mob is brought to justice, Edwin marries Ellen, and because Buzzy is dead, Midge marries nightclub owner Monte Rossen (Donald Woods). Natalie Schafer - Mrs. Thurston Howell III on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilligan-s-Island/dp/B0050MB5AC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilligan's Island</a>&nbsp;- has a cameo. The highlight of the film is Vera-Ellen's (her film debut) terrific dance number to ""So In Love,"" though her singing voice was dubbed by June Hutton. It is interesting to note that Vera-Ellen's first film, and her last American film -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Christmas/dp/B00MMPB6R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Christmas</a>&nbsp;- both featured Kaye. Vera-Ellen's only film after WHITE CHRISTMAS was the 1957 British musical LET'S BE HAPPY (unavailable on DVD). Except for a couple of TV appearances at the end of the '50s, she retired from show business and lived in seclusion until her death from cancer in 1981 (six years before Kaye's death). The best film of the four. Five stars.

Disc 3: THE KID FROM BROOKLYN (1946): A very entertaining film in which Kaye portrays Burleigh Sullivan, a milquetoast milkman who eventually becomes World Middleweight Boxing Champion. Danny reunites with Virginia Mayo, who plays his love interest, Polly Pringle, and Vera-Ellen, who plays his sister Susie. Though Kaye was not a trained prizefighter, the boxing scenes look authentic. Vera-Ellen has two wonderful dance routines in the picture, though her singing voice is dubbed again, this time by Dorothy Ellers. Four stars.

Disc 4: A SONG IS BORN (1948): A remake of the 1941 Gary Cooper movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ball-of-Fire/dp/B00J2TE3DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ball of Fire</a>, this is a terrific all-star big-band musical, featuring Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, Benny Carter, Charlie Barnet, Mel Powell, Harry Babasin, Louis Bellson, Al Hendrickson, The Golden Gate Quartet, Russo and the Samba Kings, The Page Cavanaugh Trio, and the dance team Buck and Bubbles (who play window washers, but, unfortunately, don't dance - in fact, there is no dancing at all in this film). The ever-present Virginia Mayo also stars as a gun moll who hides out from her gangster fianc and the rest of his mob, but falls in love with Kaye's character (a music professor). The story doesn't resolve itself until the waning moments of the movie. Four and a half stars.

Except for the theatrical trailers, there are no extra features. Four stars overall.",1421539200,8,4469,5.754916792738276
6080778,4,B00GJT1ZPU,"For Danny Kaye fans the two best in this collection remain Wonder Man and The Kid from Brooklyn. The transfers of Up in Arms and Wonder Man were not of the same quality as those of The Kid from Brooklyn and A Song is Born, the last being of the highest quality in the set. All four films are in color. Danny Kaye had not quite reached his comic peak (1950s) in any of these Goldwyn films of the 1940s, but this set is invaluable for fans of Danny Kaye. Up in Arms is clearly dated as a film, but contains Danny Kaye's first notable singing/dancing solo routine in the ""lobby number"". Wonder Man begins his forte of playing double roles, while the Kid from Brooklyn gives Virginia Mayo increased screen time with Kaye while allowing his comic persona to develop in material ranging from loyal company milkman to unwilling boxer. If you are a fan of jazz music, A Song is Born records Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Tommy Dorsey, Charlie Barnet, Lionel Hampton, Mel Powell and others making music with Danny Kaye in color! One such scene is almost as swinging and joyous as Danny Kaye and Louis Armstrong singing duet and scatting ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" in Danny Kaye's movie of The Five Pennies (1959). A Song is Born becomes a document of these great musicians looking and sounding wonderful in post World War II America. A Song is Born is a musical remake of the classic comedy Ball of Fire with Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck and gives Kaye a chance to show his versatility as an actor as well as a comic. A highly recommend set of 4 individual DVDs in the Warner Archive Collection that reduces the cost of collecting Danny Kaye comedies.",1420243200,11,1654,4.516666666666667

After viewing many of WB Archives great MGM & WB classic musical collections, this transfer has to be one of the worst.
Over saturated colour, colour bleeding, very hazy resolution, when it is sharp there is a very prominent herring bone pattern that overlays the image. There is hardly a sign of film grain. Where did Warners get this this transfer from?? Fox Archives.

All four movies are good ""clean"" fun.  ""Up In Arms"", a bit of an Army spoof, was Mr. Kaye's first movie and it is a delight to see Dinah Shore performing as well.  ""A Song is Born"", while entertaining, doesn't have any of the performances featuring Mr. Kaye's unique style and panache. It is great fun to see many of the big band heroes from the 1940s like Benny Goodman, Luis Armstrong and others while Professor Frisbee (Kaye) and the professors are writing a history of music.  ""Wonder Man"" is a favorite.  Seeing Mr. Kaye playing twin brothers with quite opposite personalities is entertaining.  The Kid From Brooklyn is a fun boxing show with night club performances thrown in for good measure.  Vera Ellen is spectacular as always.

One thing to note about all of these movies is that they are from the 1940s and this is reflected in the films.  However, even if unversed on the era, you can enjoy all of these movies.",1395187200,21,1103,4.389162561576355
