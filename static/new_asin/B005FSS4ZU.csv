8470638,1,B005FSS4ZU,I would like to write something positive but with this movie I can't. Was a waste of money & time to watch it.,1457222400,,110,3.8260869565217392
8470639,4,B005FSS4ZU,Saw this many years ago. Wasn't sure how well it would hold up. So many of these old movies aren't nearly as good as nostalgic memories make them seem. This one though is still very entertaining. Fairbanks outdoes The Professor from Gilligan's Island for ingenuity.,1397260800,3,265,4.911111111111111
8470640,4,B005FSS4ZU,"I  ordered  MR ROBINSON CRUSOE as I  wanted to see  Douglas Fairbanks (Senior) again,  having very much enjoyed seeing
him  in  REACHING FOR THE MOON (DVD)  I  regret that  I didn't see  Douglas Fairbanks' films  years ago;  but it seems that
he made only a few ""Talkies"",  which  I've never seen on television.  MR ROBINSON CRUSOE is a fine  comedy, in which
Douglas  displays his strength and agility.  It's a  film to  suit  both adults and children,  being quite funny throughout.",1372377600,3,484,4.703703703703703
