2899127,5,B000TGJ8BC,"I love NCIS and this four pack was a much better bargain than buying each season individually. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase.
I was also impressed with the special features. They really give you some excellent behind the scenes looks at things, which many other tv shows on DVD don't do.",1206835200,,299,4.555555555555555
2899128,2,B000TGJ8BC,"I'm ordering NCIS season episodes, but wonder why this 4-pack is $60 more than ordering the 4th season with the 3-pack?  That's bizarre.",1202256000,9,136,4.913043478260869
2899129,4,B000TGJ8BC,"This made a wonderful Christmas gift for my wife who is an avid fan of the series.  Delivered ahead of promised date, and was as advertised.",1199577600,4,140,4.384615384615385
2899150,5,B000TGJ8BC,"I love NCIS: I was first introduced to this show last year, but never really gave it a second thought. After summer 2008, my mom was watching the marathon on USA Network, and that's when I totally fell in love with the show. Why do I like it? There's wit, humor, and drama: all packaged into one show. The casts' characters are so different from one another that it is refreshing. Gibbs: who doesn't love Gibbs? And Abby, Ziva, Tony, McGee, and Ducky: you fall in love with these characters and their little querks. I am so happy to have purchased the four season pack. NCIS is an amazing show: you won't be disappointed.",1233792000,3,621,4.456140350877193
2899151,5,B000TGJ8BC,I love NCIS. I love the pricing on the set. Can't wait til season 6 comes out.,1230336000,,78,3.6470588235294117
2899152,5,B000TGJ8BC,"great review of all 4 seasons. I like the commentary,but there were only
mostly video commentary from the actors and donald bellisario. I would have loved to see less video commentary and more video commentary. Just
hearing a voice is like listening to the radio. I want to learn about the characters more and their video commentary's. That would be the only thing I would like to see done on the videos and scenes.
thanks

2899153,5,B000TGJ8BC,"This series is fantastic!  I got hooked the summer after the first year when they were playing out re-runs.  Got my family hooked as well; to the point were they no longer enjoy CSI Miami but would rather watch NCIS instead.  The difference?  NCIS is real and shows very different people working together.  Not robots monotonously doing the same thing each week.  The characters actually have 'character' and show emotion, love, respect and concern over each others feelings and wellbeing.  That is a real show.  Not just cool handed hollywood glam but hard working people doing a usually thankless job.  Plus, with the military aspect...makes it all the more enjoyable and different.",1226534400,,684,5.035714285714286
2899154,5,B000TGJ8BC,"I never watched this show.  I kept reading the reviews and they were all good so on the fifth season, I began to watch.  Loved it!  So I ordered seasons 1-4 to catch up.  I can watch them over and over. All the cast members are great and even though Kate was killed off and replaced by Ziva, I really enjoy all the shows.",1225584000,2,321,3.96875
2899155,5,B000TGJ8BC,If you like NCIC this is the package deal for you got all 4 seasons in one and have the 5th on the way.,1219968000,,103,3.3333333333333335
2899156,5,B000TGJ8BC,I like all of the episodes of this TV show. I will miss the players they supposedly eliminated the last season.,1213488000,,111,4.333333333333333
2899157,1,B000TGJ8BC,"Ok kids... let's do some math.  You have a 4-season bundle-pack for $156, and individual seasons 1-4 for $33 each...Let's see... $33x4 = $132.  So...$156 vs. $132.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't buying things bundled/en masse/in bulk supposed to be cheaper than buying individually?  Come on, Amazon!  I don't think anyone doesn't appreciate your generally low prices, however, I'd think it would be prudent to mark down bundles accordingly.  This disparity is indicative of sloppy control measures/oversight in my book.

I'd like to make clear my poor rating is directed towards Amazon and its quality control, not the product, which is a fine series.",1211760000,16,657,5.1415094339622645
2899158,5,B000TGJ8BC,"The actors have better personalities then the other shows, except csi miami. Gibbs and David and Abbey are tops.",1208131200,,112,4.947368421052632
2899159,2,B000TGJ8BC,"The copy of the 4 seasons I received did arrive in a timely manner, in a fancy blue felt box marked ""special edition"" however, in randomly checking out a few of the discs, all of them have closed captioning on the screen with NO way to turn it off, so you have to watch it through all that print, which I don't appreciate. Also, of the 4 or 5 discs I pulled, the first disc of season 2 either is faulty or has nothing on it, because my dvd player says loading then makes a lot of clicking noises like it's searching for something and nothing happens. All of the other discs I have tried work, as well as others I have, so it is NOT the player. I now wonder how many other bad discs and missing episodes I'm going to have. Hard to take when paying so much.",1206921600,8,755,4.04
8209198,2,B000TGJ8BC,I liked NCIS -Los Angeles and hoped to get started on the original NCIS with this 4- pack of seasons. To my surprise they don't have subtitles. Without those they are worthless to me with my poor hearing.,1526169600,,204,4.394736842105263
