3457562,5,B001AQMBGE,I LOVE THIS SERIES.  I PURCHASED SEASON 1-3 WHEN THEY BECAME AVAILABLE AND JUST RECENTLY PURCHAED SEASON 4 & 5 AND I PLAN ON PURCHASING THE OTHER SEASONS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.  THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SERIES THAT WAS ON TV.  I ALWAYS ENJOYED IT AND AM SO GLAD THAT I AM ABLE TO PURHASE IT.  I HAVE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THIS TO BECOME AVAILABLE.  SHOWS OF TODAY COULD TAKE A GREAT LESSON FROM THIS SERIES.  THEY DON'T MAKE TV SHOWS LIKE THIS ANYMORE THAT YOU CAN SIT DOWN WITH YOUR FAMILY AND NOT BE AFRAID OF CUSS WORDS OR NUDITY.,1383004800,6,536,4.057142857142857

I hope this can come to fruition in a timely manner.

3457569,5,B001AQMBGE,"This season is tough with three two-part episodes, one dealing with a plane crash, one dealing with Steve getting shot and Mark tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to death row  and the last where Mark becomes obsessed with stopping a bomber.  Each episode helps to create the family feeling between the characters and helps the characters become more relatable.  The season ends with a cliffhanger where the hospital is blown up with Mark, Steve, Amanda, Jesse and Agent Wagner in the building when it goes.",1470873600,3,516,4.908045977011494

3457575,5,B001AQMBGE,"I love this series!  After years of only having the first 3 seasons on DVD they finally released all 8 seasons.  This season, just like all the others, did NOT disappoint.  It is a show with lighthearted mysteries that I don't even feel bad if my kids watch with me.  My 4 year old actually has a HUGE crush on Jesse Travis :)  I remember watching it with my parents when I was a kid and I loved it then too.  Nothing too gory and minimal bad words.

Fatal Impact wouldn't play at all as well as  An Education in Murder. Talked to Death stopped after 1 hour.. I could go on but wont.
I am appalled at the fact Amazon would send out such a piece of trash. If  it wasn't such a hassle I would send it back and request a refund .",1453420800,5,433,3.988372093023256

3457613,4,B001AQMBGE,"I love Dick Van Dyke.  These episodes are great, but Season 4 is outstanding.  I've ordered Season 6 and can't wait to watch it.  I look forward to Seasons 7 and 8.  I love to watch Dr. Sloan, his son Steve, Dr. Travis and Amanda Livingston (or is she Bentley now?) solve the crimes.  It's just fascinating.  And Dick Van Dyke always inserts his own brand of humor into each episode.  I love the father son relationship, too.  Lots of fun.",1399248000,,439,4.333333333333333
3457614,5,B001AQMBGE,"The series got better at this point...more stars doing parts like Robert Kulp, Robert Vaughn, and many more.  The writing got better, too.  I have to go on to the next season.",1399248000,,175,4.4375
3457615,5,B001AQMBGE,Dick Van Dyke has always been one of my favorite actors and the Diagnosis Murder series is my favorite.  i am creating a library of all his series,1397433600,,146,4.214285714285714
3457616,3,B001AQMBGE,"Bad recording of some of the episodes
Actually the last one you cannot watch it at all, sound and picture not synchronized , pixels everywhere in two words disaster. Pity for the show, this episode looked quite intriguing",1395878400,7,221,4.842105263157895
3457617,4,B001AQMBGE,"Okay, it was never destined for an Emmy but it's a good show the whole family can watch. The plots are mundane but half the fun is how they get there. And, who doesn't love Dick Van Dyke? The guy is a national treasure. Victoria Rowell has a flair for understated comedy and still looks beautiful. All in all, it's a good way to spend an hour or two.",1394928000,,350,4.086956521739131
3457618,5,B001AQMBGE,"I like to watch murder mysteries. However, I'm not a fan of graphic violence. I enjoy using my thought process to figure out, ""Who done it?"". I love the regulars in this show. As the seasons progress, the shows get _more violent, gruesome and terrifying. I thought this was to be an enjoyable ""Who done it?"". It has become a typical violent, gruesome show. I have finished ordering the series, but will have to ff past the parts I find beyond what this show started out to be.",1394841600,,476,4.420454545454546
3457619,5,B001AQMBGE,"As I have mentioned before, I LOVE this show.  In this season, though, it is more serious than previous seasons.  Dr. Sloan goes up against a HMO over the death of a little girl and the last episodes he is dealing with the son of a man who was executed after being put in jail by Dr. Sloan and he knows the man's family is behind the attempts to discredit him but nobody else believes him, outside of his friends. This season also ends in a great cliff hanger.",1394668800,3,460,4.157303370786517
3457620,5,B001AQMBGE,"Like apparently a lot of other people I first saw this show with a parent back when it was on. I quickly became a fan and now own all 8 seasons. I've always been a fan of Dick Van Dyke and actually enjoy this show more than his more famous show from the sixties. They don't make shows like this anymore. The cast is perfect, with each bringing his or her talents to the murder solving table. The cast come across as actual friends, none of the petty sniping or insults, or the more popular sexual innuendo that transgresses almost every show today. These shows are about murder, but do play out as a family friendly show. I'm no prude, but just simply enjoying these murder mysteries for entertainment value is not the norm today. Now the shows have to have an edge or taboo subject matter to be considered ""good entertainment"". The DVDs themselves are fine with no trouble playing them, and the picture is pretty good as well. VEI the company that puts these DVDs out has done a very commendable job. One small quibble though I noticed in the season five series cliff hanger episode ""Obsession"" is missing a certain scene. In the scene Dr. Mark Sloan goes to visit villain Carter Sweeney at radio station to appear on his radio talk show. In the original broadcast Dr. Sloan walked down the hallway and viewers were treated to a snippet of the Dick Van Dyke show episode, ""100 Hours"" in which Rob Petrie is doing a radio broadcast. Dr. Sloan looks at Rob and shakes his head in amusement, then proceeds to Carter Sweeney's broadcast booth. I assume VEI was unable to secure rights to this fun little clip. Viewers of the Dick Van Dyke show season four can see this clip in the extras section. Other than that I would very much recommend this set to any lovers of entertaining murder mysteries. It's surprising how much fun murder can be.",1392768000,13,1838,4.505988023952096
3457621,5,B001AQMBGE,Loved it. Wish all of the seasons were affordable. Since we don't have Diagnosis Murder on tv very much watching the DVDs is a real treat!,1392163200,,138,4.346153846153846
3457622,5,B001AQMBGE,"I love Dick Van Dyke and this series!  I think it's so cool that his son plays his son, they get to work together, and occasionally Barry's two sons appear in the episodes as well.  The dynamic between all of the characters is excellent, and I love the plots!",1390867200,7,259,4.26530612244898
3457623,5,B001AQMBGE,I have the first three sets and was looking for the other seasons.  I found five but there seems to be no four.  What gives?  I also have the Diagnosis Murder Movie Collection,1390521600,,175,4.242424242424242
3457624,4,B001AQMBGE,"Basic human problems can result in murder, more than crazed killers. These programs deal with the former, whereas other program today deal with the later. It's a good change of pace to a have more story than tension and gore.",1389571200,,225,4.65
3457625,5,B001AQMBGE,"I have six of the seasons, that speaks for its self. Not going to wright a review on all the seasons because there all great.",1387843200,,125,4.04

8278608,3,B001AQMBGE,"The opening episode was very complicated and convoluted compared to other seasons.  The writing made me feel like they were throwing out false evidence on purpose.  Other episodes were ok.  The characters are GREAT and entertaining.  We have yet to view the rest of the episodes.

One big problem though, one episode on the first disc stuttered and skipped as if it were dirty, but it was brand new. The entire second disc, brand new without a scratch would not play at all. There is a video note at the beginning saying that there are ""anomalies"" in the original recording, but if that was the cause of this problem, there would be a glitch that would move on and the DVD player would not struggle to read the info on the disc.  But I noted the counter numbers on the DVD player were stopped and stuttering too, meaning it was in the digital information on the disc, not in the master recording.",1517788800,,896,4.5
