6358875,5,B00JHPRII6,I workout 6 days a week and consider myself in pretty great shape. Tjis workout is definitely challenging and I love all of the premixes available. Left me sore the next day and wanting more!,1362960000,,191,4.485714285714286
6358876,4,B00JHPRII6,I am happy I purchased this workout dvd to add to my collection. I enjoy Kelly Coffey-Meyer's workouts since she challenges you to lift heavier weights than many of my other dvd's. This is a good workout. I prefer to first do 20 to 30 minutes of cardio then follow it with one half of the workout.,1360800000,,297,4.228070175438597
6358877,5,B00JHPRII6,"I am a runner and do Kelly's workouts on my off days to strengthen and tone the rest of my body.  This is by far my favorite video of Kelly's!  I cannot do fast choreography moves and there is none of that in this video, just alternating cardio and strengthening moves that provide results!  I had a minor knee/foot injury for about a month and used this video for my workouts, just following the modifier so I didn't do any big jumps.  In a month I lost 1/2 inch on my waist which I have not done in years of running!  Even following the modifier I felt it was a great workout, comparable to the amount of work I would do with running without the impact on my joints!  With all the premixes on this video, it never gets old!  I would recommend this to anyone!  If you are just starting out, follow the modifier for moves that are a little easier and use lighter weights and work your way up.",1357084800,,892,4.175438596491228

6358880,4,B00JHPRII6,"This is a good workout for days when you are short on time. I would say it's of moderate intensity, so it's also good for days when you don't have a lot of energy but want to get a workout in. This is not going to get you to the ""next level,"" though, as it's not strenuous enough for that. There's no learning curve for this video; you can dive right in.",1353024000,2,354,3.9305555555555554
6358881,5,B00JHPRII6,"I've just started doing Kelly Coffey-Meyer workouts and I am already a big fan!  This is the 3rd of her workouts that I've tried.  They are super efficient, but powerful workouts.  This DVD includes two different 30 minute workouts and multiple pre-mixes.  During each 30 minute workout, Kelly alternates sections of strength training with sections of cardio.  The strength sections use both lighter and heavier weights.  Kelly tells you to make sure the weight is heavy enough to make you feel like you're working hard.  Each strength section includes multiple exercises that work on both lower and upper body.  Following each strength section, you move into a cardio section that includes multiple moves to get your heart rate up, for example a one legged jump with an arm raise followed by knee repeaters.  A lot of the cardio is higher impact, but Kelly has one of her workout partners presenting modifications.  You work hard on this DVD, but it's over quickly.  Kelly is good at explaining each exercise and is quietly encouraging.  The pre-mixes on the DVD are also great-- there are combinations of the two 30 minute workouts if you want a longer workout.  There are also breakouts of just strength work and just cardio. This is an all over excellent workout.",1352678400,13,1267,4.892018779342723
6358882,5,B00JHPRII6,I really enjoyed this workout!  It was a nice all over body workout and got my heart rate up.  It's the first DVD that I've purchased by Kelly Coffey-Meyer and I look forward to trying more of her DVDs.  She cues well and is a ball of energy!,1350432000,2,242,4.0
6358883,4,B00JHPRII6,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the instructor.

Kelly Coffey-Meyer has become perhaps my very favorite instructor.  Not only does she now teach in the town where I grow up, but also she's about my same age (mid-40s), and I just really click with her low-key, down-to-earth style.  With PLATEAU BUSTER, Kelly has developed new workouts which will mostly likely appeal to intermediate exercisers like myself who want to kick things up a notch by performing heavier weight intervals with higher impact cardio drills.

Kelly works out here with two of her usual background exercisers, Sam and Lori, plus a new modifier, Noelle, who performs all of the cardio moves low-impact. The Main Menu offers options for Introduction - Workout One - Workout Two - Stretch - Premixes and a Music On/Off option. Kelly cues viewers to use a heavier and lighter set of weights; during the second workout, she mentions that she is using 12# and 7# weights (I used 10# and 5#, but may have been able to go heavier in some spots).  She also uses a mat for the Stretch and Bonus segments.  I have broken down each section in detail below, adding approximate times in parenthesis.

**WORKOUT #1 (28.5 minutes)**
This workout begins with an approximately 5-minute warm-up.  Kelly starts with a march that moves into a knee/kick combo on either side.  This is followed by a jog/shuffle combination, first throwing the arms up, then shrugging the shoulders down to loosen up the traps.  Kelly then moves into side-to-side steps, adding a chest pull and hamstring curls.  She also performs squats, moving into a rear lunge with a floor touch.  Kelly finishes the warm-up with low jacks to full jacks, repeating the entire series of moves once.  She starts the weight work with the heavy weights.  In general, she tends to do two moves with the dumbbells followed by a cardio interval.  The first strength exercise is a squat to either side with a shoulder press on the rise up.  Next comes a step to the front with a reverse fly.  The first cardio begins with a squat jump and moves into 30 seconds of jumping jacks.  Going back to the heavy weights, Kelly cues a side lunge with a lateral raise followed by a plie with a biceps curl.  For the next cardio series, she does a sort of toe tap/knee hop (kind of like a hitch kick) followed by fast repeater knees.  At this point, she moves on to the lighter weights.  The first move is a combination lunge front with punch/squat back.  Next, she drops one of the dumbbells for ""stir the pot.""  That's it for the light weights, but then the ENTIRE weight series is repeated from the first heavy weights exercise.  At the end, Kelly performs a quick (<2 minutes) stretch, getting in the hip flexors and a Figure 4 stretch as well as few brief stretches for the upper body.

**WORKOUT #2 (27 minutes)**
Kelly starts the second workout with the same warm-up (see above). She again begins the weights work with her heavy weights:  the first move is a squat with an alternating front arm raise.  This is followed by a simple 1-armed row.  The first cardio interval starts with a balance on one leg to a knee hop and then moves into a sliding skater before finishing on the other side.  For the next weight series, Kelly starts with a hip drop (a bit like a bent-legged deadlift) with an upright row; this is followed by an alternating reverse lunge with bicep curl.  For cardio, she performs split switches which develop into runs.  Now it's time for the lighter dumbbells.  The first move is an alternating step wide to the side with three punches to the front.  The final move of the series is ""shake the paint""--moving the dumbbell side-to-side in front of you to target the core.  As in the first workout, Kelly then returns to the beginning to repeat ALL of the moves.  She also again concludes with a brief (2 minutes) stretch similar to the one offered in the first workout.

**STRETCH (9 minutes)**
This is a nice option for those who want a longer stretch than what is offered in the main workouts.  As is usual for her DVDs, Kelly is alone for the stretch, and although she does include some yoga-like moves, she is still wearing her shoes during the Stretch portion.  Kelly holds the stretches a bit longer than she does in the workouts, but because she also targets many more body parts, the holds are still relatively brief (about 10 seconds).  The first 2 minutes of the stretch is performed in a standing position.  Kelly then moves to the floor, where she does stretches seated, on the back, and on the stomach.  She finishes with a few additional standing stretches.

As with all of her DVDs in the 30 Minutes to Fitness series, Kelly has included plenty of premix options on PLATEAU BUSTER.  Here is how they are listed on the Premixes Submenu, with the times as given by Kelly:

*Plateau Split Rounds (Round 1 then Round 2) 26:19
*Plateau Challenge (Both Workouts Alternating Each Exercise) 42:24
*Plateau Dumbbell's [sic] Only Mix (Workout 1 and 2 All DB's Then Repeat) 31:42
*Plateau Cardio Mix (All Cardio Sections, Workouts 1 and 2, Two Times Each) 32:18
*Plateau Combined Mix (Both Workouts) 45:16
*Plateau Kelly Harder Mix One (Workout One with Bonus Moves) 35:08
*Plateau Kelly Harder Mix Two (Workout Two with Bonus Moves) 32:11
*Plateau Bonus Buster (All Bonus Moves) 21:14

The Bonus Buster workout features only the warmup (the same as used for the main workouts) and 8 bonus moves, each of which are performed for about 30 seconds to a minute.  The bonus moves are as follows:
*Forward roll attempts
*Side lunges
*Weighted squat thrusts
*Lying chest flies with leg raises
*Pommel horse
*Fast straddles
*Weighted pop squats
*Modified pullover with crunch

As always, Kelly does a nice job with these workouts.  PLATEAU BUSTER will probably most appeal to those who enjoy performing compound moves with moderate weights.  Although Kelly performs the weights moves at a controlled pace, it would be difficult to go very heavy with your weights, as she moves directly from one exercise to the next with no rests (unless you were to skip the cardio portions to rest).  Rather, these workouts are more similar to the traditional Firm Aerobic Weight Training (AWT) model, where your heart rate stays up throughout the workout.

This DVD is definitely well-done, but I think that it may have a more constricted range of appeal than some of Kelly's other offerings.  Beginners are likely to find the workouts too difficult/too high impact, even with the modifications, and more advanced exercisers may feel that the routines are too short and/or too easy in parts.  I did feel that these workouts were definitely appropriate for my own intermediate level, although my personal preference is for more strength-focused work and less impact.  However, for intermediate exercisers looking to step things up, PLATEAU BUSTER just might fit the bill.",1348185600,29,6901,4.758620689655173

I speak from experience 30 plus years and a connoisseur of exercise DVDs; my first was the Firm workout and that was exceptional in its day and still proves to be a good workout but  Kelly's are consistently top notch and no nonsense but clean ( no swearing like you will find on some of  Jillian Michaels DVDS), concise and precise!!
DO TRY !!",1454976000,,440,4.419753086419753
6358897,4,B00JHPRII6,"This is another installment in the 30 Minutes to Fitness workout series by Kelly Coffey-Meyer, which has been very successful.  This is Plateau Buster which is intended to help get through those stubborn plateaus that we all encounter at times.

As usual, there are 2 - 30 minute workouts which are the same format.  They alternate strength and cardio intervals, here though there are 12 reps of each exercise which I like.  I like knowing how many reps you are going to do, this allows me to choose the right weight.  Kelly often uses the format where she will do an exercise for a minute, which is fine too.  A minute doesn't seem that long but if you choose a challenging weight it will feel awfully heavy by the time the minute is up!  The exercises are done in a compound fashion, where you are working upper and lower body simultaneously.  This is a very time efficient way of exercising and you can get a lot done in a short amount of time.

In each workout, a few rounds of exercises are done and then repeated.  I am not a huge fan of repeats, I generally prefer to do an exercise and move on.  The good news is that there is a premix where you can choose to do each exercise once, which I really like.  In addition there are other premixes to choose from, which makes this DVD very versatile and a great value. I found the exercises to be pretty straightforward, I am not a huge fan of compound moves and find some kind of difficult to do.  Mostly, because I am not that coordinated and sometime find working one set of limbs better for me.  But that's my own issue.  I found that I used an assortment of light to moderate weights, typically 5 to 8 lbs, occasionally using a 3 or 10 lb.  Even though there aren't tons of reps I found that I couldn't go really heavy with this workout due to the compound nature of the movements.  Perhaps in time I will grow with this workout and be able to increase my weights eventually.  I also find that Kelly tends to do a lot of shoulder exercises, and she goes quite heavy in those exercises.  She must have really strong shoulders!

Kelly is joined by a few background exercisers, including Noelle who is the modifier.  I find that I follow the modifier quite a bit, as they keep the workout entirely low impact which is what I prefer.  Noelle does a great job here and she has a great smile too!

I have tried many of Kelly's DVDs, I wasn't sure I was going to like this one honestly.  I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it!  I think I will get a lot of use out of this DVD.  The 30 minute format is perfect for me because I don't have a ton of time and honestly I find myself moving away from really long workouts nowadays.  An hour is usually the max for me.

Overall, I rate this 4 and a half stars.  I am really glad that I picked this one up.  Give it a try!",1452988800,,2826,4.22803738317757

6358899,5,B00JHPRII6,"I have lots of fitness dvds, and I use them to work out 5-6 days per week.  Even with the great variety I have, this is one I go to often.  I love the slightly shorter length of these workouts than her others (about 23 minutes to the cool down), for when I need something quicker, and Kelly, as always, is fun and motivating without being annoying.  Nice mixture of cardio and weights, which is the most efficient way to work out.  No dread factor with this one.",1438128000,5,462,4.215909090909091

6358901,5,B00JHPRII6,"Great workout! Tough but efficient. I love that the DVD gives you so many pre- mixes to choose from. You can do cardio only, weights only or a combo of both. I will definitely buy more of Kelley Coffey-Meyer's DVDs!",1429574400,,215,4.4
6358902,5,B00JHPRII6,"Two tidy, effective and efficient workouts on this DVD that utilize a couple of size dumbbells at your fitness level and an easy to follow format.

6358903,5,B00JHPRII6,"This is the first video I have done from Kelly Coffey-Meyer.  I can not say if it is an actual Plateau Buster, yet as I have only done each workout once.  However, whether or not the plateau busting works for me, I will still be using this video a lot.  I thought it was just great.  The workouts seemed to fly by, but I was still working hard.  If a few of the moves look impossible, still try them, as I was surprised with three moves that I thought I wouldn't be able to do, I did fine.  I think the thing I like about this, you do all the moves for 12 reps.  It is a manageable number.  Kelly is upbeat, peppy, and presents the workout in an easy to understand manner.  I will definitely be trying more of her workouts in the future.",1428019200,5,737,4.027586206896552
6358904,5,B00JHPRII6,"When this DVD and Cardio Quick Fix were first announced, I was really interested in the Cardio Quick Fix DVD and ordered it. It took me longer to catch up with this DVD because when it came out I wasn't sure that I would like it. Well then, it totally figures that I would be less than thrilled with Cardio Quick Fix and that I would really enjoy this one, Plateau Buster. I do think that most of the people who like this DVD will be self-described intermediate exercisers or someone wanting that level of a workout for a change.

The main menu is pretty standard for a Kelly-Coffey Meyer DVD. It gives you the following options:

> Introduction
> Workout One
> Workout Two
> Stretch
> PreMixes

In each of the two workouts, you do two compound strength movements and then there is a cardio burst in between those. Each of the strength moves is done 12 times - she says something like, ""We do 12 of everything."" There are some cardio moves that are seemingly based on time and you do more than the 12 repetitions, but other that that, she sticks to the pattern. In both workouts, she does mostly compound moves that kept my heart rate steadily up. She starts with the moves that call for heavier weights and then toward the end of the segment, she switches to moves that call for lighter weights. She goes through all the moves and then repeats the sequence. Usually, I hate it when an instructor goes through a series of moves and then repeats it. However, in this workout, presumably because she does only 12 of each move, I didn't mind repeating them. In fact, the second time around went faster for me than the first. In both Workout 1 and Workout 2, I looked up to see the time on the clock when she went into the cooldown. The time just flew for me.

I did Workout 1 and Workout 2 twice each. Then, I decided to sample the premixes. I chose the harder mixes because they had footage I hadn't seen yet. I really like that Kelly films extra footage that she uses in the premixes. In the two workouts, Kelly workous out with three background exercisers and one of them, Noelle, acts as the modifier and keeps the moves low impact. In the bonus footage, Kelly is by herself. The duration of the premixes ranges from 21 minutes to 45 minutes. This submenu includes the following options:

> Plateau Split Rounds (Round 1 then Round 2)
> Plateau Challenge (Both Workouts Alternating Each Exercise)
> Plateau Dumbbells Only Mix (Workout 1 and 2 All DB's Then Repeat)
> Plateau Cardio Mix (All Cardio Sections, Workouts 1 and 2, Two Times Each)
> Plateau Combined Mix (Both Workouts)
> Plateau Kelly Harder Mix One (Workout One with Bonus Moves)
> Plateau Kelly Harder Mix Two (Workout Two with Bonus Moves)
> Plateau Bonus Buster (All Bonus Moves)

For advanced exercisers, I am not sure you will like this DVD if you are expecting it to give you a good workout ala Cathe or Michelle Dozois recent workouts or other leaders of advanced workouts. These workouts are intermediate level, even though it is true that you can use heavier weights to make the workout harder. However, note that the bonus moves are more advanced than the regular workouts, so doing the premixes with those moves in them leads to a more advanced workout than the two main workouts. The bonus moves include:

> Forward roll attempts
> Side lunges
> Weighted squat thrusts
> Lying chest flies with leg raises
> Pommel horse
> Fast straddles
> Weighted pop squats
> Modified pullover with crunch

I really like this DVD and the options it gives. However, remember that you must be able to do/like/accept the following in order to enjoy this DVD:

> You must like compound moves
> You must be able to get over repeating the moves
> You must not be looking for a beginning or advanced workout

To me, it felt like Kelly had a vision for this DVD in what she wanted to accomplish. Personally, I think she did accomplish her vision and a good workout was the result for those of who use this DVD. There are many workouts on the market today that want to shock people off a plateau and they go about it by offering really hard workouts. There is some high impact in this workouts (which is easily modifiable) and it can be a challenge to keep up. To me, it was a fun, moderate workout that is different than the other workouts I am doing presently.",1424995200,4,4314,4.442477876106195

Kelly's dvds are the real deal-she makes me feel strong,yet her workouts do not bulk me up like others I've tried. My first dvd by Kelly was BodyShop,which blew me away by what an amazing workout it was. I quickly ordered a bunch of her other dvds and have not been disappointed. I love that her dvds contain so many premix options so I can easily fit in a workout every day,whether I'm pressed for time or have an hour to spare. A half hour with Kelly will really make me feel accomplished,and I feel proud that even as a busy mom,I can fit a workout in somewhere.

I needed something new, but more brief, as an extra option (in the old days I used Leslie Sansone and really appreciate what she offered me at the time, but her DVD's no longer move my heart rate beyond a blip unfortunately).

Each workout shares the same 5.5 minute warmup but the workouts themselves end with their own 2 minute cool down.  This is my second KCM workout (my first was the BODY SHOP):  I highly recommend this for intermediate levels who don't have an hour or more to workout but want to sweat and feel challenged each day!

6358922,5,B00JHPRII6,"I love her videos. They are serious ""get fit"" videos. No girly giggling, sexy moves or anorexic looking participants. The other women who work out with her have real bodies. I love the way that there are various mixes of the videos so that you can chose what body parts you want to work on or length. She also uses real weights-up tp 15 pounds which is far more effective than the usual 3 lbs in other videos. If you are new to Kelly I would suggest you get her ""Start Here"" video, it is still challenging, but it gives a great workout.",1364860800,7,536,4.213592233009709

8651086,5,B00JHPRII6,Just recently purchased this after using quite a few of her other DVDs. This one definitely kicks my butt a little bit!  I like it and I'm glad I added it to my collection,1509580800,3,171,4.029411764705882
8651087,5,B00JHPRII6,"I've only done workout one, but judging by that, this will be my favorite workout DVD for quite a while. It says that it's ""challenging but doable"" and that is completely appropriate.

I love that there are other mixes besides just 1 and 2.  You have strength training mixed with cardio and repeat the sets. This format is followed in both one and two workouts.  Then you can choose another mix to do just the dumbbell segments from both workouts, or just the cardio from both workouts or mix the two workouts or do both complete workouts in one. There are also ""bonus moves"" that you can combine with either workout or do separately for 21 minutes.  These multiple options make the DVD a real bargain in my opinion.

I love the instructor and the moves. This is the 2nd ""30-minutes to fitness"" DVD I've bought and I'll buy more. The Kettle Bell (or dumbbell) workout didn't impress me that much for the actual workouts but I liked the instructor enough to buy a second one. So glad I did!",1508112000,,989,4.472222222222222

8651089,5,B00JHPRII6,"About Me: I have been exercising regularly for years, and I am very familiar with the basics of good form and targeting different muscles. I am also a huge Kelly Coffey-Meyer fan. She is always my choice when I can't get to the gym. Her home workout videos are the best. She puts together great routines and is exactly the right level of cheerful/talkative, without being annoying. This is the eighth one that I've purchased (and I have my eyes on more!)

About Plateau Buster: I gave the workout five stars, but my review is actually mixed. If you are new to exercise or looking to try Kelly's workouts for the first time, I DO NOT RECOMMEND that you purchase this one. Try one of these instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Minutes-to-Fitness-Body-Shop-with-Kelly-Coffey-Meyer/dp/B00GKLV2KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Minutes to Fitness: Body Shop with Kelly Coffey-Meyer</a>&nbsp;,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Minutes-To-Fitness-Muscle-Definition-With-Kelly-Coffey/dp/B0038SUBCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Minutes To Fitness: Muscle Definition With Kelly Coffey</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kelly-Coffey-Meyer-s-30-Minutes-to-Fitness-Start-Here/dp/B006R111KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30-Minutes to Fitness Start Here</a>

On the other hand, if you, like me, are an avid Kelly-fan looking for round out your collection, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this video.

Basic Format: It is your usual choice of two half-hour long workouts. Note though that, unlike some others, the warm-up and stretch are included in that time, which is actually a little under 30 minutes. (Excellent!) You also get the best stretch ""bonus"" section of any Kelly video (about 8 minutes), and a better than average variety of pre-mixes. The music is standard fare, not overly distracting and there is an option to turn it off.

The two workouts are almost entirely mixtures of compound moves, with and without weights. This is unusual for Kelly. Usually you get a combination of focused moves for a single muscle group with other a few compounds, and it makes it more challenging. She also goes through the first set of every exercise before she starts repeating a second set half-way through. That is also unusual for Kelly and it creates the feeling of mixing things up a lot, which is good (not boring), but also very challenging for balance and coordination, especially since (again) you are seeing more compound moves here. If done well, this is one of her most intense workouts. It is also the only Kelly video that I have thought about quitting mid-way through (glad I didn't!).

Also, although I felt like I got a great workout, it was not as even as some of her others. My chest, back and triceps, for example, did not get as much strength training as they do in her other videos. On the other hand, there was more cardio and coordination, so I think it balanced out her other workouts well.

The one final note is that more than other workouts, Kelly assumes you know what you are doing and does not walk you through the basics of good form to the same degree you will see in other Kelly videos. That is another reason that I do not recommend it for beginners.",1499472000,5,3316,5.608782435129741
