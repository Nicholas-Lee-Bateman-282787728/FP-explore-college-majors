4433715,3,B004MWLXIK,"Stars : Donna Hamblin & Lucien Eisenach.
Written and Directed by: Steve Sessions.
Film is incredible in execution ( pun intended).
Setting is mostly a haunting house,But not confined to that...Lots of car footage and a very cool grave yard scene.
Donna Hamblin is perfect linchpin of a leading lady,She is a definite go-to for any film.
Lucien Eisenach has a persona perfect for a witch doctor or one who dabbles in black arts,Great celebrity look this side of Criss Angel.
Monster was a nice touch,Maybe alittle stiff.

THE CAR,There is this Golden Hearse that Lucien drives quite an awe-worthy site up there with famous scary cars with bigger budgets.
Early murders made sense and yet were senseless,Know what we mean ?",1304121600,3,721,4.909836065573771
4433716,2,B004MWLXIK,"I'm only giving it 2 stars for the opening bath tub scene. The lack of dialogue could almost classify this movie as a ""silent"" film.

4433721,2,B004MWLXIK,"Kind of alright for a very low budget film.  Gets the point across about voodoo to a limited degree, and brings in some decent scare characters.  Acting stinks overall, but you get used to it kind of as the movie progresses.  You can whip through it in about half an hour skipping unnecessary fluff, so it doesn't take too much time.

Lame, sure, but better done than the ones I rank one star.",1459814400,,393,4.342465753424658

4433758,2,B004MWLXIK,"SINISTER is the story of a woman plagued by the eeevil conjurings of a vengeful voodoo practitioner. While this should be a gripping tale of supernatural mumbo jumbo, it is instead a very dull story w/ very little intrigue. Alas, the voodoo-villain looks ridiculous, and the hokum is hokey! If you do watch this movie, you just may be reduced to pure carbon during the seemingly endless ""car wash"" sequence. We are literally taken through a car wash w/ the main character! As it adds nothing to the story, I can only believe that the prop-car simply needed a wash on that day of filming. This scene, while dull in the extreme, is still more frightening than anything else in SINISTER. Unless, of course, you are terrified by a few cockroaches or allergic to men in black nail-polish. Sheesh!...",1385337600,5,794,4.719424460431655

4433760,1,B004MWLXIK,"Wow what a steaming pile of cow dung.  I've seen movies made by high school kids with their cell phones that are more entertaining.  I had to shut it off after about 20 minutes.  By the way in order to sit through 20 minutes it means you have to sit through a lady going through a car wash.  That's right, the scene must have taken 3-4 minutes where she literally does nothing but sit in her car and look around while it goes through a car wash.",1366848000,,445,4.080459770114943
4433761,1,B004MWLXIK,"Except for the opening credits, just about everything is a close up shot (which also looks like it was filmed in 8mm).  You get to see the poorly done finger nail polish job on Gerard Prewitt, the voodoo doctor, Emily, the ""stalked prey"", as she goes through the /very boring/ car wash seen or just about anything else in the film.  The story line is very poor, the first (nude) victim, appears to be a plain looking, wanna-be porn star, and the overall acting was just unskilled.  It is 87 minutes of time killer.  It was filmed at Biloxi, Mississippi and it should have been buried there.",1365206400,,590,4.485981308411215

8436278,1,B004MWLXIK,"I should have read the reviews of this movie before I watched it. There was nothing scary about it at all. The acting was bad...like very bad and awkward at times. Weird camera angles and a plot with very little dialogue. The brother ""Sam"" goes from being unhelpful (""I'm running late, just get some rest"") & skeptical about the paranormal investigation to suddenly being very involved, researching the voodoo curse (oddly knowing exactly what she needs to do), and even confronting the conjurer. And again with the plot line... So this conjurer instantly kills 2 other people by using voodoo dolls but makes the lead character go through a bunch of weird interactions and visions all because she tapped his hearse leaving no dent? What did the 2 people that he killed do to him that deserved instant murder via voodoo dolls?",1491004800,,825,4.816901408450704
