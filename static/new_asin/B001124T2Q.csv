This DVD was produced by the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland, so it was probably subject to stricter budgetary limits than might a public TV documentary be. The audio is very tinny, as if it were all recorded in a toolshed. And the editing is a bit dodgy, such as one reference to the Covenanters in the Sixteenth Century, rather than the Seventeenth. But that is only a distraction, for the content is meaty, with much exporation of Erastianism versus a Reformed understanding of church government and its relationship to civil government.

The DVD also includes a separate promotional video for the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland, including some discussion of Psalmody.",1242518400,5,950,6.251908396946565
