8385240,5,B002ZQ8E7S,"I love how the blood brothers break things down and explain what they are doing and why. They don't gloss over it like most other hunting shows. These are real life guys with 9-5 jobs that are willing to share their techniques for hunting big bucks. I've learned a lot from the two dvds that I have from them. I stumbled onto the hill country DVD by accident and picked this one up as it's mentioned several times in hill country, and I was not disappointed. I'm hoping to add a few more of their films to my collection as well.",1476057600,,528,4.237623762376238

8385243,5,B002ZQ8E7S,"""Hunting Marsh Bucks"" DVD is fantastic. Dan Infalt is a public land trophy hunter. If the video seems arrogant - it really isn't. He's just saying there aren't many ""tricks"" you can go out and buy at a store. But there are tried-and-true methods for marsh scouting and buck killing. He is sharing his tips and techniques and he's a nice guy.  [...]",1386720000,2,348,4.523809523809524
8385244,3,B002ZQ8E7S,"This DVD has some decent information. The production quality isn't very good as much of it looks like it was filmed on my cell phone. Lots of the hosts sitting around talking without many visual aids (actual deer sign etc.)The host borders on arrogance much of the time, makes it harder to take him seriously.  The DVD is also relatively short. A much better DVD is the series by the Eberharts ""Hunting Pressured Whitetails"". 5 hours of straight information.",1376611200,2,458,4.7974683544303796
8385245,5,B002ZQ8E7S,"This is an awesome video, focused on deer hunting the public marshland of Wisconsin (applies universally in midwest though). It has a huge focus on teaching rather than selling products, with appropriate maps, commentary, and taped hunting trips for illustration. The main host on the show, Dan Infalt, is brilliant at deer hunting.

I hunted a long time and kind of thought I had things figured out, but this had me looking at the land I hunt with new eyes. Great product.",1357257600,,473,4.7682926829268295
