8622585,5,B00GF9IC28,"This DVD is highly recommended for fun Monster, Halloween thrills. The Imagineering section alone was worth the price of the entire DVD! This DVD made me feel like a little kid again. The memories just came flooding back. Thank you for this.",1405209600,4,241,4.761904761904762
8622586,5,B00GF9IC28,"I wasn't a Horror fan...well, I just LIKED Horror movies; alright I like the rush of being scared. Then I met Doc Shocker...alright he gave me his card. I followed him on Facebook. I became intrigued with the concept of HORROR and the documentary. I'd only met one person who really liked HORROR movies and mostly scaring the crap out of other people...my son. Which sorta scared me...

My son LIKES...no he LOVES this stuff. He wants it to be Halloween 365 days of the year. He becomes a creepy clown for nearly two months out of every year. After watching this SHOCKUMENTARY~ I get it. I understand the tug toward Horror movies, the masks, the make up and mostly the power of the macabre. I enjoyed the interviews with celebrities and those whose artistry in makeup and mask production for Universal Studios monsters we all know and love. The discussions centered around the ever popular and well known Don Post masks. The insight into how all that was designed & created, is worth the asking price, but there is so much more to this documentary~it's Entertaining and Educational all in one.

If you know one of these people, and always wonder what to get them, because HELL...they already have every HORROR movie ever produced or masks, or all the creepy teeth designed or whatever, already. Then this~this masterpiece of SHOCK is what they don't have and NEED to complete their collection!

Get it for them. This was created, master-minded and made for the VERY HARD to PLEASE HORROR fan on your Christmas or just Gift list. Get one for yourself, because then you will totally understand the MONSTER fan on any of your gift lists. Best of all, it is Kid Friendly and great for all MONSTER Loving fans of ALL ages. It is also chocked full of special short films. My 3 year old grand daughter loves it! Especially, the short film, ""How My Dad Killed Dracula"".

The knowledge of Daniel Roebuck, Chuck Williams, Guillermo del Toro, Rob Zombie and others is all neatly tied up in this documentary of Horror, and should not be missed. They didn't just research this on Google; they LOVE the power of the macabre & MONSTERS, as well. They are more than well-informed; their knowledge is immersion into the subject.

Don't Delay, get it today.",1387756800,6,2239,4.687022900763359
8622587,5,B00GF9IC28,"This is a fine documentary DVD--it is actually one longer documentary and several shorter ones that are featured as ghoulish monster extras.  ""Dr. Shocker's Vault of Horror"" (hosted by friendly horror host Dr. Shocker and his sinister alter ego Daniel Roebuck) celebrates the whole experience of monster fandom and collecting (with a special focus on the 1960's and 1970's) and offers up a great deal of historical background information and drool-worthy photographic material.  All told, the DVD covers a lot of ground.

Monster collecting is of course a currently happening slice of culture, with a vast assortment of products to tempt the enthusiast.  But it started as a fad some fifty years ago.  This DVD looks back to the ""Monster Boom"" craze of the mid-1960's, and explains how it happened, from the appearance of the Universal classic monster movies on television for the first time, to the creation of the Aurora monster model kits.  It then goes on to cover Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazine, its editor Forrest J Ackerman, and the groundbreaking Halloween and mask products created by Don Post Studios and Imagineering, Inc.  And then, of course, there's more and more.  Many interviews with film industry artists and luminaries are featured.

The special features include a mini-documentary on Imagineering, Inc., a convention panel discussion on the fond memories of ""Captain Company"" (Warren Publishing's own mail-order house), a 3-D gallery of Dr. Shocker's startling horror collection (3-D glasses included!), and the charming short film ""How My Dad Killed Dracula.""  Throughout this disc, the collectible incarnations of Frankenstein's Monster, Dracula, The Wolf Man, and many other classic monsters are well represented.

It's really a full platter of material, and all in the spirit of lighthearted, ghoulish fun.  I enjoyed it so much when I got my copy that I watched everything on the disc in one sitting.",1387065600,5,1931,5.254071661237785
8622588,5,B00GF9IC28,"This DVD is loaded with goodies.  From the creators of the critically acclaimed ""Halloween ..The Happy Haunting of America"".  You will not be disappointed. The DVD features the shockumentary MONSTERMANIACS(tm) with Rob Zombie, Guillermo del Toro (HELLBOY, PACIFIC RIM), and narrated by Jorge Garcia (LOST) plus a lot more.

Plus you get your very own Collectible 3D Glasses and a Dr. Shocker Fang Club Membership Card. This is a rare gem for the whole family!",1386028800,5,459,5.093333333333334
