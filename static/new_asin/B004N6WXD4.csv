4435524,5,B004N6WXD4,"I don't see anyone who knows, admires, and follows Bruce Lee's inspiring life and discipline not liking this one. It is a well done production. It is not an action movie, it is Bruce's story before he came to USA. I was touched, and inspired. The actor they casted, looks so much like him,and screams just like him. One thinks for moments that it was actually Bruce himself. Definetly a must have for Bruce Lee followers and fans.",1327708800,8,430,4.5256410256410255
4435525,5,B004N6WXD4,"This a great movie about a Great Man, it's not a Kung Fu movie, its about his life and how he became so Great! If your a fan of Bruce Lee this is a most for all collectors.",1323302400,12,172,3.5526315789473686
4435526,5,B004N6WXD4,This is a very well done production dealing with the Bruce Lee legend/legacy.  It shows what daily life was like in Hong Kong during the early years of Bruce Lees life. This is an authentic Asian production whose special features  section shows other well done Asian productions which are available such as Confucius and Ip Man. This is a highly recommended movie.,1322179200,21,364,4.854838709677419

4435531,5,B004N6WXD4,I say much more for any bruce Lee fans. It just shows a bit of his story when he was young. Not much on training with grandmaster Yip Man. Shows  two major fight scenes only. I just added it to the rest of my Ip Man and Bruce Lee movie collection.,1415491200,,247,3.843137254901961

4435534,3,B004N6WXD4,I am a Bruce Lee since the 1960's.  This movie overall is good and comes from Mr. Lee's family member. To learn about his young years one can see he (Bruce Lee)  was headed for greatest and he was an exceptional person that change martial arts forever. He was ahead of his time.,1391817600,,278,4.226415094339623
4435535,3,B004N6WXD4,"The movie was good,but was a little disappointed there were no English audio. Still enjoyed it. I would watch again",1391472000,,115,4.8
4435536,5,B004N6WXD4,Nice movie to have to watch  how Bruce Lee live his younger Days. How Bruce Lee met IP MAN and traning.,1385078400,,103,3.9047619047619047
4435537,3,B004N6WXD4,"The bio-pic ""Bruce Lee, My Brother"" (original title, ""Li Xiao Long""; UK title ""Young Bruce Lee"") begins with short footage of Bruce's real-life siblings Phoebe Lee and Robert Lee sitting and talking to the camera. Based on the book written by Robert, younger brother by eight years, the film chronicles the young days of Bruce Lee in Hong Kong in the 1940s and 50s, before he was forced to leave for the United States.

So this is not exactly an action movie. There are several action set-pieces (with one brief scene reminding us of super-fast punching of Donnie Yen's Ip Man), but none of them is really thrilling. Aarif Rahman does his best as young Bruce Lee, but not convincing enough as a martial artist. Poor editing of the fight scenes does not help.

As a biographical movie ""Bruce Lee, My Brother"" starts off promisingly with the birth of the star in San Francisco in 1940. The film's period details seem very fine, conjuring up the atmosphere of Hong Kong and a family of Cantonese opera singers into which he was born. Two veterans Tony Leung Ka Fai and Christy Chung deliver sold performances as Bruce's parents. Director team Manfred Wong and Wai Man Yip also throw in some references to Bruce Lee films that fans might notice and enjoy.

What the film lacks is a compelling story. The name of Robert Lee certainly lends the film some authenticity, but filmmakers fail to make a good use of historical facts about young Bruce, like his entry in dancing competition. The story about his romance and friendship seems bland and generic, and his run-in with the local gang looks contrived.

The bio-pic itself is not bad. It is only that it does not have much to offer. Perhaps the film would have been more interesting had it followed the life story of Robert, who also was sent to America.",1376438400,2,1801,4.654088050314465
4435538,5,B004N6WXD4,"This is a great addition to the Bruce Lee stories out there.  If you are a fan of Bruce Lee, you get to see the human side of the life he lived.  The actor who plays Bruce Lee actually looks like him when Bruce was younger.",1374192000,2,223,3.8260869565217392
4435539,5,B004N6WXD4,"Great movie, & from what I've read about Bruce's life story, very accurate. The only thing that I did not like was that it was subtitled & in Chinese, which is cool, but you miss a lot of the action trying to read the subtitles. ANd there are some scenes where the actors spoke in English. & if this was not the case they should have dubbed it in English to sell to the English speaking market.
But other than that, I am very happy with it. It was promply sent to me by Amazon...",1371513600,3,479,4.052631578947368
4435540,3,B004N6WXD4,"This movie is very interesting, but it only has cantonese and doesn't have Mandarin option. that's really, really a shame!",1367884800,,122,5.15
4435541,5,B004N6WXD4,"not as action packed as expected like his other films. But I loved to see his development of a man., before he became a movie star.",1365724800,2,131,4.076923076923077
4435542,5,B004N6WXD4,"Bruce Lee!!! Need I say more!  I collect Martial Art Movies and this documentary/ movie is an awesome addition to the library.  Plus, it's about Bruce growing up!  A different side of the man you never saw.  Chuck Norris just cried.",1362268800,,232,4.585365853658536
4435543,5,B004N6WXD4,Ofcourse it wasn't really Bruce Lee as the movie was made after his death but many of his advisers and family helped this film get into a good direction and I loved it just as much as all of Bruce's earlier films when he was alive.,1361750400,2,231,4.043478260869565
4435544,5,B004N6WXD4,a good retelling real life of Bruce lee. there's so many Bruce lee movies out their. You can't go wrong with all he's movies. Bruce lee is such an inspiration to all. the way he's a philanthropist . the ideas . he's martial arts . I mean come on now...

4435549,5,B004N6WXD4,This movie isn't supposed to be an action movie! Its supposed to be the untold story of Bruce. The point of this movie was to show the soft side of Bruce and all the things he went through in his kid-teenage days. The part that made me cry was when he went looking for his junkie friend. Yeah. . . .,1348444800,2,299,3.918032786885246
4435550,1,B004N6WXD4,No action what so ever and you have to read the entire movie. Two tums down I wouldn't  recommend it to no one.,1347062400,2,111,3.8260869565217392
4435551,5,B004N6WXD4,"A MOVIE FOR BRUCE LEE FANS AND PEOPLE WHO NEVER KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM,THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE,TRUST ME,YOU WONT REGRET IT.

4435552,2,B004N6WXD4,"First off I love Bruce Lee and what he has done for martial arts and how he has influenced the world.

 I wanted SOOOO much to like this movie but I found myself forcing myself to watch it. I understand that it was not a Martial arts flick (complete with wires and crazy stunts) but ""I"" wish they would have spent a little time on the relationship between Bruce and his martial arts family. what roll did Shifu Yip men play in his life. It seemed like he only trained for a few weeks before his fight with the English guy. It just seemed rushed. I know you can't please everyone when making a movie, but for those that are interested not only in Bruce lee's life but his martial art journey as well. I don't think you will totally enjoy this movie. I would give it 5 stars for the effort but that's about it. There are some touching parts and character building moments in this movie. I guess in the end the family did not want to focus on the Martial arts part because we all know that part.  I think the martial arts should have been left out and the movie should have just focused on this youth, family and friends.",1342137600,3,1118,4.214953271028038

Intro by his brother Robert, is the best I seen on a Bruce Lee story,it is not a kung fu movie, though it does have it, it is beautifully done, not fantasy like so many others, you learn about his youth,how it all began,excellent film quality, hope some day it will be english dubbed so others can enjoy,an amazing story of Bruce as a human being,and you believe the actor is really him.",1336521600,5,428,4.2317073170731705
4435554,5,B004N6WXD4,I thought this was a good movie about bruce lee's life and how he end up coming to America but when I saw the previews I thought it was more about Bruce lee's training with Ip Man.  especially on youtube they were calling it Ip Man 3 which of course I knew it wasn't Ip Man 3 as I own all 3 of the Ip man movies.,1333584000,,312,3.656716417910448
