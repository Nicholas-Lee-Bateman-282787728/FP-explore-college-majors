8761826,5,B01FYKBEMI,The disks work great and for what they give you to how much you pay for it is a bargain.,1538265600,,88,3.45
8761827,1,B01FYKBEMI,"Don't buy it what a stupid movie not worth $ Dallor,
Very poor bad makeup special effects worse than a B movie.
Can't believe I bought it.!!",1536883200,,140,4.222222222222222
8761828,5,B01FYKBEMI,"I bought this for the first film which I've seen before. I haven't seen the second, so I'll update when I have.

That being said, All Hallow's Eve was a big surprise the first time I saw it. What I expected was a cheesy, campy flick, but what I got instead was an extremely well done homage to classic horror tropes done in a very interesting, original, and unsettling way. It's a legitimately disturbing anthology film, but it's all part of the same story instead of being a disjointed mess like most anthology movies. It's all held together by Art the clown who really steals the show with a memorable performance. They really outdid themselves with a small budget and clearly put a lot of hard work into making something worthwhile and truly scary. It's too bad not many will ever see it. If you watch and enjoy I recommend Terrifier which features Art and is made by the same director.",1535241600,2,889,4.521739130434782
8761829,2,B01FYKBEMI,Seen All Hallow's Eve once and wondered just what I was looking at and had to watch the second to see where they could take it.,1534809600,,127,3.923076923076923
8761830,3,B01FYKBEMI,"I loved All Hallows' Eve, but the second was is pretty terrible...and not in a good way. It was almost hard to make it through. But worth the buy if you don't own the first one and you're like me and just want to complete your horror movie collection.",1534377600,,251,4.142857142857143
8761831,2,B01FYKBEMI,"I'm really confused. I watched a movie called Terrifier on Amazon Video, same director & same clown, release date 2018. Apparently it is somehow linked to these movies. I can't speak to these films but Terrifier is an ugly, vicious, and affected little crowdfunded movie about a killer clown named Art that starts off well and takes the ol' turn-for-the-dumb at about the halfway point. There are reviews for the film on Prime Video but I'm not finding it here for some reason.",1522368000,,477,4.759036144578313
8761832,3,B01FYKBEMI,The first is my favourite!! Scary and fun! I now have all 3!!!,1511308800,,62,3.8461538461538463
8761833,5,B01FYKBEMI,Starts out the family finds a VHS tape.  Parts one and two the tapes become reality . They shut the t.v. Off but its too late. I thought these All Hallows Eve movies were a good scare.,1509667200,,184,3.972972972972973
8761834,4,B01FYKBEMI,Creepy as hell!,1509321600,,15,4.333333333333333
8761835,3,B01FYKBEMI,All Hallows Eve 1 is an excellent scary movie that can stand on its own.  Part 2 is not good at all.  It seems as though part 2 was added to this package to entice buyers in getting a 2 for 1 deal.,1502755200,3,197,3.558139534883721
