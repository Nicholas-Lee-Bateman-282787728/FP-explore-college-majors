560767,4,6303091938,Waited 50 years to see this movie again. It was worth the wait!  They really knew how to make pictures in those days.,1360972800,2,117,4.086956521739131
560768,3,6303091938,"We are in 1857... The 'Nathan Ross' is sailing from New Bedford, Massachusetts with Joel Shore (Robert Taylor) as her captain for three years whaling trip...

Captain Joel Shore is glad and proud for marrying Priscilla (Ann Blyth), a lovely shining little girl who was in love with his brother, Mark (Stewart Granger), believed dead!

Mark, not proved dead, is not a man to fall easy... He left his ship full of fever and rum... A little native girl (Bette St. John), with the face of an angel, looked after him and cured his fever...

In a lagoon on an unchartered island over an oyster bed that had never been touched since the world began, Fetcher (James Whitmore) and Quint (Kurt Kasznar) offer Mark a line of a fortune of beautiful black pearls 'some like full moons and some like tears'...

Captain Mark Shore appears like a ghost on the 'Nathan Ross' and tells his brother Joel that 'half a million worth of pearls were at 12 feet of water, just waiting to pick up.'

Captain Joel, knowing that the pearls could bring blood on the ship, refuses to turn back the ship to get the fortune that the native girl dropped in the shallow water while fleeing, with Mark, the furious frantic natives...

Mark, forced by his ambition to return for the pearls at any cost, becomes the main instigator of a mutiny on the Nathan Ross, starting a revolt against his own brother...

Ann Blyth, whose beauty 'blushes all the whales,' increases the rivalry between the two brothers on the whaling ship...

A remake of a silent melodrama made in 1923, ""All The Brothers Were Valiant"" has all the exciting moments of a great adventure film: a storm braving the fury of Cape Horn, a deadly combat with a monster of the deep, cut-throat fight between whaling sailors seeking fortune, and and exotic romance in the arms of an island sweetheart...",1232755200,7,1830,4.643962848297214
560769,4,6303091938,"This is a good movie. Ann Blyth is in love With Stewart Granger but he takes off so she marries his brother who owns a whaling schooner. But then Granger comes back. And he wants her back but her husband, Robert Taylor, loves her & he's not going to give her up. It becomes a fight of who's the strongest & the best.",1115424000,3,316,4.031746031746032
560770,5,6303091938,"A watchable film, and one that I never missed on telly when I was a kid. But there's one compelling reason to see it. When Stewart Granger is temporarily marooned (or something) in the Hawaiian islands (or somewhere like that - I last saw this about 15 years ago) his love interest is a 'native girl' played by Betta St John. This actress had an unremarkable semi-leading-lady career in Hollywood for a few years; see, for example, her brief appearance in The Student Prince as the unwanted harridan whom Edmund Purdom's character reluctantly marries. But here, in All The Brothers, she is a vision of divine loveliness. To this day - and I'm nearly 40 - I have never seen a more beautiful actress in any film. Get it for this reason only. ...",999388800,14,743,4.552238805970149

561006,5,6303091938,"All the Brothers Were Valiant (1953) is a fascinating adventure that takes place on board of a ship and on a beautiful island. You'll see highly popular but a little stiff Robert Taylor (Quo Vadis, 1951), deservedly popular and very athletic Steward Granger (Scaramouche, 1952), excellent and beautiful Ann Blyth, and, late in the movie, you'll get to see a woman that you will never forget, because her beauty is above any other woman you'll ever see in a movie, Betta St. John (Tarzan the Magnificent (1960, British, with Gordon Scott as Tarzan). She appears on the shore, and immediately adds 5 stars to the movie! Don't miss her! She is irresistible!",1387584000,,654,4.848214285714286
561007,4,6303091938,"All the Brothers Were Valiant has excellent cinematography and won an Academy award for it, but the strong point is the drama aboard a whaling ship.  First off, there is suspense when a brother (Granger) goes missing.  Taylor goes in search of him, but only after marrying Granger's girl.  Naturally, when Taylor finds his older brother, he's not happy.  If you're looking for the sparks of conflict, a mutiny is sure to deliver.  Throw in a family feud with jealousy and anger.  Pile on greed associated with a fortune in pearls.  This is good old fashioned adventure.  -Roger Weston, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Catch/dp/B004YTI1UY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Catch</a>",1373068800,3,749,6.0
