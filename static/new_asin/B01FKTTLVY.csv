7750607,4,B01FKTTLVY,My mother looked over the top of my tv to make sure-),1477612800,5,53,3.5
7750608,5,B01FKTTLVY,"I love love love this DVDs. When I want to add some extra atmosphere to a night with my husband or with friends or family I play the Fireplace movies. I don't know what it is, but those evenings and nights are always so special and we talk about them forever. And it actually seems warmer with the DVD on. Its great that I get to choose the sound options: the real deal with sounds of crackling wood and flickering flames or soft ambient music.
The Aquarium videos I play more during daytime in the background when Im working, reading or cleaning the house. I also use them as a moving painting during birthday parties. Its refreshing, unique and a great eye catcher. The sound of aquarium bubbles make it realistic.",1474329600,6,716,4.473282442748092
8760990,5,B01FKTTLVY,"The first season of Fire and Tropical Fish (known to fans as FaTF) is a study of opposites - between passionate intensity and cooler heads, can we find a comfortable medium?

It would be next to impossible to reveal any plot details without some sort of spoiler.  That the two worlds will never collide should at least be obvious to the most casual analyst, however, and perhaps that is enough observation.  Suffice to say the minimalistic approach to dialogue leaves the viewer to contemplate the meaning of the events for themselves.

The casting of unknown actors was a risky decision, but everyone here seems well suited to their respective roles.  And while no one performance stands out to me, the ensemble comes together as a cohesive unit, delivering the desired effect.  One can only hope the new-found fame will not go to their heads.

Missing are any interviews, 'making of' featurettes, or really any extra features to speak of, which may come as a mild disappointment to fans.  There is room for a sequel (or indeed a prequel), but rumors of a second season abound so keep an eye out.",1515888000,,1097,4.7368421052631575
8760991,5,B01FKTTLVY,So fun.  Just what we were looking for to use for background scenery & sound on our TV.  A crowd pleaser.,1502668800,,105,3.9523809523809526
8760992,1,B01FKTTLVY,TheTropical aquarium did not work at all. It took a good 3min to get the aquarium up and on screen only to be looking at a frozen screen. No movement at all. The fireplace did work but was not much to look at.,1502150400,,209,3.883720930232558

8760994,5,B01FKTTLVY,Very realistic...but I don't use as much as I thought I would.,1494547200,,62,4.25
8760995,4,B01FKTTLVY,One aquarium track froze but the other makes great use of my low-power LCD on loop for days.  Cheaper/easier than a real tank and beautiful fish.,1491955200,,145,4.576923076923077
8760996,5,B01FKTTLVY,Great to have playing on the big screen when you have house guests and you do not want them consumed with news or sports.  You don't have to stare at a blank flat screen either. Adds atmosphere to the room or social gathering a bit of a conversations piece also. I really enjoy this and my guests have too!,1490572800,3,306,4.186440677966102
8760997,5,B01FKTTLVY,"I thought the idea was kinda stupid, but I figured we'd give it a shot as background noise for reading/lounging - It's actually super relaxing! I actually really love taking naps to my fake fireplace... haha!",1490313600,2,208,4.805555555555555
8760998,3,B01FKTTLVY,Only main complaint is the case it came in was the cheapest they make and broken upon arrival. And the labels on both discs have both fire and fish printed on them when one disc is the aquarium and the other is the fire. Labels should be printed accordingly instead of having to guess which DVD you are putting in.,1487462400,,314,4.25
8760999,5,B01FKTTLVY,Amazing dvd.  Breathtaking photography.  Love all the dvds I have purchased from ambient collection.,1485820800,3,100,6.071428571428571
