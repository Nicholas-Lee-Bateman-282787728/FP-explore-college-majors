5312902,4,B009B82F6Y,"There seems to be a bit of confusion about where the films fit in, so I will explain as I give you my opinion on the three films. Hopefully this will make things more useful for people confused or unsure of the importance of the films.

First of, Tenchi Muyo In Love. This film is the first of the three, and takes place sometime after the ending of the Tenchi Universe TV series. After coming back home from Jurai and finding that the girls have all made their way back to Earth, Tenchi settled into what passes for peace around the Masaki Estate. Peace meaning that Ryoko and Ayeka are still fighting explosively over Tenchi, Washuu is always running wacky, dangerous experiments, Mihoshi makes all manner of unintentional trouble, Kiyone struggles not to kill her partner, and the ever-exasperated Sasami keeps some semblance of peace with her food. The peace is soon broken when supervillain Kain breaks loose from Galaxy Police custody, and begins to carry on his vendetta against the Jurai bloodline by going back in time to kill Tenchi's mother before Tenchi can ever be born. Thus Tenchi and company must travel backwards in time to find and protect his mother, lest Tenchi be erased forever. This film is a very dramatic turn for the series, focusing much less on comedy and introducing a villain who is truly evil. The film doesn't fail to disappoint, and for the time it was made, it had some wonderful visuals. If you're a fan of the Tenchi Universe series, this will serve as a very intriguing follow-up story that will have a radically different feel from what you might be used to in Tenchi, but never to the point where you feel as though the thrill is gone. It's wonderful to see a bold risk taken with this story, and it pays off in a rather emotional manner that is well worth the trip. Highly reccomended.

Let's skip down to Tenchi Forever, otherwise known as Tenchi Muyo In Love 2. This is a sequel to the aforementioned film and essentially the end of the Tenchi Universe storyline. Visuals are different here--this series was done by the same animation studio who picked up the reins for the divisive Tenchi In Tokyo. However, if you disliked the Tokyo series, never dismiss this film out of hand. This is firmly a Tenchi Universe story, and the writing and visual presentation, while a bit different, do not stray from that. Again, I feel this film was a bit of a risk, as the storyline has a different taste to it. We've got some serious drama again, but instead of a dark and malevolently evil villain, we this time have a much different type of story, wherein Tenchi disappears and is living in another reality, aone with his art and a woman named Haruna who has stolen his heart. Few of the main characters appear in this story, as the part that doesn't focus on Tenchi and the new reality he lives in, focuses on the combined efforts of Ryoko and Ayeka to track down the man that they love. I don't want to spoil the ending, but in the end, there can be only one woman who truly wins Tenchi's love, and Tenchi Forever rather puts a stake in the ground and decares a winner when the dust settles. This is my favorite of the three films and is very highly recommended.

Lastly, we have The Daughter Of Darkness. Now, this film is very unique in where it takes place. It essentially forms its own canon. In Japan, there was a series of actual novels released, based upon the original Tenchi Muyo OVA series. These novels followed the canon of the first six OVA episodes (the first OVA series), then went in their own direction, not following episodes 7 - 13 of the Tenchi Muyo OVA. The Daughter Of Darkness is a film based on one of these novels that has never seen print in America. Because of this, it can be very confusing. None of the other novels in this series were ever animated, so The Daughter Of Darkness stands alone in its own void. This movie is noticeably shorter than the ones based on Tenchi Universe, clocking in at only 60 minutes compared to the 90 minute run times of the other two. It is an enjoyable film about seventh girl to join the harem, a woman who turns out to be Tenchi's daughter, Mayuka! But when has Tenchi ever had time to have a child, especially one so grown up? Who is the lucky mother? And why has she only just shown up? All of these mysteries are explained in a plot that would have felt right at home in the OVA proper. For that reason alone, you may very well enjoy it. The music in the film is my favorite element, personally. All in all, The Daughter Of Darkness is a unique experience to behold. It may not be for everyone, but I think understanding where it actually fits in, and why it may seem disconnected, since the source material for it never made its ways to American soil, will improve your understanding and enjoyment of the experience. Others may not care for it much simply because, continuity wise, it's an island in the ocean of Tenchi lore that doesn't properly connect to much else. Moderately recommended based on how you feel about that.

I hope that my reviews and explanations have helped to make you more informed about the nature of these films, what to expect from them, and where they fit into the complex Tenchi chronology. Overall, this is a great price for the set, especially with a Blu-Ray release, so I'd suggest snapping it up before the price increases!",1355702400,52,5357,4.513903192584964
5312903,5,B009B82F6Y,"While most anime movies tend to be seen as nothing but filler or cash-ins, that is not always the case. These 3 movies are certainly not low-level entries, but this movie trilogy has some of the best moments in the entire Tenchi franchise.

Tenchi Muyo The Movie:Tenchi and the ladies must stop a super criminal that has escaped from the GXP. He escaped into the year 1970 and somehow attacked Tenchi's future mother. The gang must go back in time to stop this criminal from changing the future. This takes place after Tenchi Universe and is a very well done movie. The whole ""going into the past"" thing sounds corny, but they pulled it off well. Achika (Tenchi's mother) is a strong character, and you really start to feel for her as the story goes on. There is some comedy but the film goes more for the ""race against time"" theme, for the better though I will admit. The final showdown is really well done and really makes the movie stand out compared to the TV shows. In short, it is a great little movie.

Tenchi Muyo the Movie 2: Tenchi and the girls meet a young girl named Mayuka. She claims to be Tenchi's daughter and of course this throws the household into chaos. It is not really clear which series this takes place in, some say that it takes place in the Universe saga and others say it takes place in the Tokyo timeline. In the end it's best to just forget about that, and just move on. Anyway, of the 3 movies this is the closest to the TV shows style. You get Tenchi and the girls getting involved into some kind of trouble. Mayuka only adds to the trouble of course, and this causes some major tension(with Ryoko especially). This one feels more like and extended episode of the TV shows, and it lacks the strong story that the first movie has. Still, it's good, not great, but still worth a watch.

Tenchi Forever: One day Tenchi sees a strange woman near the Misaki shrine, when he begins to dream. He wakes up as an older fellow living in Tokyo with a woman named Haruna. The other girls are desperate to find Tenchi as it's been 6 months since he vanished. Ryoko and Ayeka travel to Tokyo to find any clue to Tenchi's whereabouts. Unlike the TV series and the other movies, this movie is far different. The story instead of a comedy, is a serious romantic drama. The movie is quite melodramatic, and the story is quite deep. You feel for the girls as they try everything to find Tenchi, and how heartbroken they feel that they may never find him. It's weird watching a cast of usually silly characters become deep individuals who just want Tenchi to return. The movie also reveals the real reason that Grandpa Misaki left the plant Jurai. This was meant to end the Tenchi Universe saga and though different, it is a wonderful picture.

You get all 3 movies for a reasonable price, so if you are a Tenchi fan, you can't pass this up.
How are the movies? Let's answer this with some questions......

Is the 1st movie worth buying alone? Yes, no question.
Is the 2nd movie worth an individual buy? Yes, though it's not as good.
Is the 3rd movie worth a purchase by itself? Yes, it's wonderful.

In the end you get 2 great movies and 1 good movie for a good price. Heck the 1st movie and 3rd movie are some of the best anime movies I have ever seen. If you are getting into Tenchi, do not skip on the movies. They are worth your time no questions asked.",1355356800,3,3370,4.375399361022364
5312904,5,B009B82F6Y,"The Tenchi Muyo movies - three stories based out of the Tenchi Universe series rather than the OVA's, each one unique yet fits somehow into the overall series that this classic group grew into over the years.

Tenchi Muyo in Love - The first.  When a super powerful criminal escapes from the GXP he only has one mission, destroy the Jurian royal family by going to Earth.  As the gang gets ready for movie night to see old home movies of Tenchi's mother and father Washu and Kionye get warnings that something is wrong and when Tenchii starts to disappear Washu saves him by using a temporal shield.  However as it is only temporary, they realize they must go into the past and see what events brought about an end to Tenchi's bloodline or their histories will change.  There they meet Tenchi's mother and father and realize that to protect them they need to get close - Aiayka and Ryoko are students, Mihoshi is a Teacher, Kiyone the janitor, while Sasami and Ryo Ohki watch over Tenchi with Washu as temporal guardian.  The group confront Kain at, of all places, Toyko Tower (I swear there is a big target above this thing as every time there is a distaster it seems to be the focus) in order to save the people and future they love.

Daughter of Darkness - Tenchi is a Daddy, or at least that is what a young girl named Miyuki says.  But is there more to the story than meets the eye and can the gang figure out events from Yosho's past before Tenchi and the Musaki family are destroyed.

Tenchi Forever - The third - Tenchi is missing, and the girls work to find him.  When Aiayka and Ryoko find him in Toyko, he has no memory of them, he is older than when they last saw him, and appears to be in love with a woman named Hurana.  But Tenchi is suffering for crippling headaches which threaten to kill him. Can Ryoko be the one that can save him from a crumbling world in which he was a part of.

All three were well done (though some argue the second one is filler - but fun still).  I am glad Funimaton got the rights to bring these to not only existing fans but to new ones as well.",1352937600,2,2089,4.271573604060913

5312909,4,B009B82F6Y,"As a long term fan of the franchise, I was truly excited to see this on Blu-ray.  After receiving and watching it, I learned it will be valued for a long time to come.  The collection comes in two case, which contains DVDs and Blu-rays in each. Two movies are on one Blu-ray/DVD (Tenchi Muyo In Love and Tenchi Muyo: The Daughter of Darkness).  The second disk contains the Tenchi Muyo In Love 2.  If you have seen these films and want them for collective purposes, I would recommend it. It comes with a small art booklet.  It is exactly what you expect: an HD version of the original films.  I am not certain about the specifications (aspect ratio), but it looks fantastic on a HDTV and I have no complaints. DISCLAIMER: I watched all of the films on Blu-ray, but did not watch the DVDs.

If you have not seen any of the films and are interested, it is amusing joyride.  The films were originally released in the 1990s and similar to the anime series.  I have to define these films as a mixture of drama and action.  The films do not always focus on action, which I highly appreciate.  The first two has various fight scenes which are entertaining.  The third film (Tench Muyo In Love 2) highly differs from the other two.  This movie is completely dramatic with no action nor violence.  It is refreshing and highly compelling to watch.  These movies center around mature themes and comedic. If you do not enjoy dramatic movies, you will not enjoy all the films. On the other hand, you will be entertained somewhat with its comedy.

Before purchasing this, I would recommend that you have seen the Tench Muyo series (not Tenchi Universe or Tenchi In Tokyo).  These films maintain the same themes from the series (for the most part).  It does not directly relate to the series, but will help anyone who has not seen it learn if they would like this collection.

Overall, I would not have no problem recommending this to a fan and potential newbie.  It is highly entertaining.  Each of the movies take their own distinguishing approach.  If you do not enjoy one of them, you will more than likely like at least one of the other two.",1415059200,,2131,4.494791666666667

An ancient foe that travels back in time to kill Tenchi's mom, Tenchi travels back with the group to protect her.  Daughter of Darkness is about forbidden love.  Darkness in love with light.  Old tale, but with a twist.  A jaded love of Tenchi's grandfather uses Tenchi as her revenge creating a clone child of her DNA and Tenchi.  Tenchi travels to her world in order to save the young princess, he battles for his life and the ""daughter"" that he has come to love. Tenchi in Love 2 also deals with a former love of Tenchi's grandfather.  This time in a parallel universe.  Haruna died on the trip to Earth and is not content with how things turned out and turns her attention towards Tenchi.  She drags him into her delusional world to create a life that could never happen but she so wanted.

IMO:  Ryoku is the savior in 2 of the movies.  She fights side-by-side with Tenchi.  Someone that does that is a great partner in life.  But you are left to choose since Tenchi still hasn't.",1365984000,,1137,4.368421052631579

I just wish that Funimation could have ported over the extras from the old Pioneer (or Geneon if u prefer) DVDs. Especially the extras from the Tenchi 1 and Daughter of Darkness DVDs. They contained production notes, various Theatrical trailers and TV spots, Interviews, a Tenchi Encyclopedia, hidden angle video, etc. So much left out for the Hard core fan and stuff that the new fan might never see. With these Blu-Rays and DVDs, you get the main course. That's it. No desert.

I just think that Funimation could have done a better job putting these Blu-Rays together. I'm glad to have the Blu-Rays though, and still a highly recommended purchase!",1361059200,6,790,4.683453237410072
5312920,4,B009B82F6Y,"I have been a Tenchi Muyo! fan for a long time, so much so that I searched rigorously for the DVD copies when Genco was still a by-product of Pioneer and not of Universal Studios or Funimation! And needless to say for any hardcore Anime fan out there, I was not excited to hear about how Funimation bought out the English rights to Tenchi Muyo!, and the latest work clearly shows my worries.

But luckily the dubbing here for all three movies were all done by the original cast from Pioneer! And although the sound in my opinion sounds pretty much standard in terms of 2.1 Stereo, (just could be my crappy RCA stereo though so take that part with a grain of salt), but the upscale quality of the Blu-Ray videos are very well done. I was very impressed, because usually Funimation does a really crappy job at that. Now even though you can still see some grain, its from the original artwork of the animation and not at all the result of bad pixilation. But never the less it looks good.

Now I know they force the DVD's on some of you you and that on the other hand I think look's very pixilated! The original DVD's done by Genco and Pioneer were a lot better! I think what Funimation tried to do was upscale the DVD quality for more modern wide screen televisions, as opposed to the original squared 420p tube television that was actually intended for during the 90's. Honestly I think they should've left that part alone.

Now the movie's themselves are a different matter, a matter in which I'll be very brief.
  Tenchi Muyo in Love! - Taking place after the events of the Tenchi Universe continuum, It is a story where an A1 class criminal escapes from a subspace prison and goes back in time to kill a woman by the name of Achika Musaki, Tenchi's mother. So Tenchi in the gang must go back in time to the 70's to stop him so that Tenchi can still be born.
I think that these are the weakest of the movies only because it has some serious plot holes that they never address. Such as why Kane goes back in time in the first place. I won't give away any spoiler's but after you watch it and REALLY think about it. You start to see where I'm coming from. However, I'm actually surprised that they don't do any time period jokes about the funky age of the 70's like a lot of movies were doing at the time. Or maybe that's just an American thing.

  Tenchi Muyo! Daughter of Darkness - This movie is the only one that kind of stands on its own in terms of the timeline continuums. It's more that it shares attributed from pieces of the only two at the time (before Tenchi in Tokyo), as it shares the Light Hawk Wings from the OVA series, and Det. Kiyone from Tenchi Universe. Anyways, it's about how a demon of the Tree of Darkness, Yazuha, creates a genetic specimen from her silver hair and Tenchi's black hair. That essentially gives birth to Tenchi's daughter! This is actually both a very touching as well as very funny movie with a lot of action that is a lot better than the last. It shows a lot of strong character development, mostly in terms of Ryoko, but sadly it kind of doesn't mean anything as its not building from any of the series. But there is some light touching on possible incest and jailbait exploitation....you'll know what I mean after watching the movie. But besides those few uncomfortable minutes of footage, it's still worth a look-see.

  Tenchi Muyo in Love 2! (Tenchi Forever!) - This is an actual sequel from the first movie as well as the Tenchi Universe continuum. It's where Tenchi is abducted by a spirit of a Jurian Camellia tree named, Haruna. Although it does take a theme from the original OVA's in terms of the Jurian Royal Trees, it is still just Tenchi Universe related. Anyways, the gang spend an entire year looking for Tenchi where it ends up taking Ryoko and Ayeka to Tokyo (which makes sense because this was around the time Tenchi in Tokyo series came out and the animation clearly shows). Mean while, Tenchi finds himself married to this beautiful woman with porcelain skin named Haruna, but with absolutely no memories of his former life. There is very little action in this movie, but in my opinion is by far the best one out of all three movies! It's nice to see a company that actually gets better at making movies with each attempt. And not to mention, Tenchi finally gets lucky (from none of the other six girls), and there is some animated upper body nudity.

Anyways, that's my two cents. Sorry about the length, and I hope you enjoy it!",1359849600,2,4493,4.426150121065375

5312924,5,B009B82F6Y,"Anyone having heard of `Tenchi' would already know what it's about, or would have read elsewhere the basic story. The only thing I have to say to add about this undeniably classic title is that this was historically one of the first harem series ever created, and even today it stands out as something special from the genre. In fact, the OVA was created before the harem genre even became a genre--they were just creating a sci-fi comedy/action show with an over-the-top romantic comedy element to it. Because of that, even amongst other recent harem titles, the girls stand out as having far more living character to them and you just genuinely care about this cast than you would in similar recent shows. Plus, if you have an appreciation for the classics, and/or if you like titles that are weird, inventive, imaginative, funny, and just plain fun, 'Tenchi' is definitely from that spectrum.

Otherwise, the title of my review basically sums it up. As a forewarning, if you already have the Pioneer releases, and if you especially care about special features, you're better off keeping them. The only downside to Fuminations' blu-ray release is that it's as bare-bones as they come--no production sketches, no trailers (except for the third movie, oddly enough, I guess they weren't able to get all materials), no interview with Christopher Franke (the phenomenal composer of the first movie), not even creditless OP/ED which is even more odd. But if you're a `Tenchi' fan, and you have a blu-ray player, you're doing yourself a favor double-dipping on this. If you're new to the `Tenchi' saga, this is the best time to start checking out this title (just know that two of the movies are actually sequels to the TV series and not the OVA, while `Daughter of Darkness' is a branch from the OVA continuity). Both the OVA and Movie sets come in good-looking, rigid artboxes with art mini-booklets as companion items. The classic OVA itself (that is, precluding the third season which could've been a lot better) has never looked more beautiful in its existence, and the equally great movies have been attuned to look even more cinematic than they ever were.

To sum up, all I have to say is--Thank you, Funimation, thank you so much for caring enough about us fans for this special collector's release! `Tenchi' fans old and new, you owe yourself to get this!",1356307200,,2360,4.839108910891089

Tenchi Muyo in Love:

Video: B / Film A+

Tenchi Muyo in Love is on my top 20 anime films of all time. This movie was my first experience watching anime. The only draw back is that you need to watch the TV series first to have an appreciation for the movie. One of the best anime soundtracks ever. As for the video, the film elements appear very soft, unfocused or blurry mostly due to the age of the movie. This movie would look beautiful if a proper remaster was done, doubt that will happen though. There is also a good amount of film grain throughout. For HD I would say that the picture is just average at best, but it is the best the movie has looked for a North American release of the film. Not sure if its an upconvert from an old master. Just don't expect crystal clear sharp images. A bit dissapointed, but happy to have it on Blu ray and is a night and is a vast improvement over the old DVD version. Must own!

Tenchi Muyo in Love 2:

Video: A / Film A
Excellent conclusion to the Tenchi Universe series following the first movie. Brings everything to a nice conclusion. Character development, especially between Aeka and Ryoko, is what makes the movie. Also we get to find out which one of the girls Tenchi finally chooses. Great transfer considering it is a newer movie. Nice sharp images. Probably the best this movie can look. Must own for fans of the TV series and a great companion to the first movie.

Tenchi Muyo: Daughter of Darkness

Video: B+ / Film C+

Not one of the better Tenchi movies. A bit sappy for my tastes. Takes place in the OVA universe. Movie had very  and extremely memorable parts, but it could have been better. Felt more like an OVA episode then a movie. Animation is top notch. Must watch for fans of Tenchi Muyo in general. The video is better than the first movie, with nice bright colors, don't believe this movie will look any better, even with a renamster. Daughter of darkness just doesnt rank up there next to the one before or after it.

Tenchi Muyo Movie Collection DVD's

I know they are DVD's, and I am happy to get them as an extra on this set, but they look horrible. They look just as good as the old Pioneer versions. I can swear that the picture on Tenchi Muyo in Love looks the same as my non-anamorphic version when the picture is zoomed in. Theres pixalation galore on these three DVD's. Looks like Funimation threw on the old masters and zoomed the picture on Tenchi Muyo in Love and Daughter of Darkness to make them appear anamorphic. I know this is a nit pick, but I have DVD's of other films like Glaxy Express 999 or Venus Wars (new re-release version), that look beautiful upconverted. If you don't own a blu ray player, you are basically screwed with bad transfers. Just thought everyone should know before buying.

8539257,4,B009B82F6Y,"I love the movies, this edition is great but it does have some flaws, the box is very thick with a very beautifully printed cover. however there is a space where the box underneath is lower and the cover has cracked and frayed on those two corners, not the end of the world but looks kind of bad on the shelf. I was kind of hoping this would be a blu ray sized box, but its actually dvd sized with two dual dvd style cases inside. I like that they included reversible covers.

The transfers are pretty good, you can see the dust on the animation cells and little imperfections from the film and comes with the original dubs which is always a plus.",1465430400,,647,4.217741935483871
