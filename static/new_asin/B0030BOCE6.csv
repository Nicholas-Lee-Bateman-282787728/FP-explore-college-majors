4043086,5,B0030BOCE6,"I truly enjoyed this concert. I do wish:

1. He would have picked his best songs from Home Before Dark (another bite of the apple and Another day that time forgot) instead of what he choose; it really ground the concert to a halt.
2. Playing the Prologue from Hot August Night was a dream come true but obviously not filmed by a true Diamond head; the part where the orchestra ends and the guitar kicks in has been played on air guitar by every Neil Diamond fan sometime in their life. Showing the guitar and drummer would have made it so much better, but it was still great.

My favorite part of the concert was Hell Yeah. Anyone who tells you that he phones it in needs to listen to that; he really kicked it home.

If you are a Neil Diamond fan, you will have a blast with this. If you aren't, what is wrong with you?",1257379200,,820,4.144654088050315
4043087,5,B0030BOCE6,"Neil Diamond is a true showman, and his latest DVD release ""Hot August Night/NYC"", is in my opinion the ultimate audi/video experience for any Neil Diamond fan.  The picture and sound quality is pristine, and what you get is a two and a half hour 27 song complete concert which far exceeds any other Diamond offering on DVD.  He performed most of the big hits that fans expected to hear, as well as a few songs from his latest cd.  The band is well rehearsed, and features long time Elvis Presley drummer Ron Tutt, as well as Maxine and Julia Waters, who are two veteran back-up singers who have worked with so many top tier artists over the years.  The packaging is well thought out, and includes an 18 page booklet, complete with stunning photo's, and is housed in a sharp gatefold case that is much nicer than the standard DVD case.  This DVD is being marketed exclusively through Walmart, which is why only the used Amazon dealer network is selling them here.  I will tell you that the set sells for a bargain price of $12.00 at Walmart, so if you have one near by, that is the place to get it.",1255305600,,1098,4.384236453201971
4043088,3,B0030BOCE6,"Must say this is the best music dvd of diamond to date that I'm aware of. However the title `HOT AUGUST NIGHT / NYC' is very misleading. A more appropriate name would have been `NYC /  SOME SONGS FROM HOT AUGUST NIGHT'.  Maybe this is just another sales trick to get as many copies of this dvd sold to our diamond maniacs.
Diamond and his producers must please take proper cognisance of the fact that HOT AUGUST NIGHT refers to that  unique and thematic performance at the GREEK THEATRE  35 years ago. There is no substitute for that most memorable and magnificent performance.  For all of you who have that double cd : It is audio - and album wise by far a better version than this dvd. Why the poor 5.1 and not in good dts which would reflect the true stature of a great artist such as Neil Diamond. All songs from HOT AUGUST NIGHT are not on this dvd and some of Diamond's later songs are advertised here - completely out of context. If you are a Diamond fan - then buy this dvd. I'd rather listen to the double cd version - better audio, better album....
Diamond's vocal ability is still intact and really withstood the test of time comparing with most of his contemporaries, and his stage personality is just as professional and warm as before. With today's technology it is sincerely hoped and believed that our generation will still stand a chance to listen to a proper and quality recorded dvd version of HOT AUGUST NIGHT as performed at the Greek Theatre.(where is MORNING SIDE - one of his best old time masterpieces)",1253232000,,1527,4.458781362007168
4043089,5,B0030BOCE6,"All I can say is ""WOW"". I watched this with 5.1 surround sound and it makes you feel like your right there. Neil is getting better with age. Voice sounds better than ever. I would definitely recommend this concert. I hope it comes out in blu-ray as well. I will buy that as well. He does most of his hits and some new ones. Only songs missing are Desiree, September Morn, Longfellow Serenade, Heartlight and Hello Again. Most of his oldies are here. I have over 100 concert dvds and this is by far the best.",1251763200,,507,4.291666666666667
4043090,5,B0030BOCE6,"This DVD meets all expectations and then some. Back in August 1972, the original ""Hot August night"" was recorded in LA. Now in August 2008, IN New York City's Madison Square Garden cones ""Hot August Night/NYC"" DVD. Neil Diamond is now 35 years older-but he and his band are better than ever. Filmed over a four night run at MSG, the picture and sound quality is top notch-it's not like earlier releases where Video quality is reduced over time. This time, they film the concert and they spared no expense in making this by far the best ND DVD to date.

Neil does a lot of the classics and some new songs from his recent Two albums. This is the Neil Diamond DVD to own and Cherish for years to come.",1251504000,4,698,4.32824427480916
4043091,5,B0030BOCE6,"Having seen Neil Diamond in concert on previous tours, this DVD delivers exactly what we have seen and expect from this performer - a highly polished show that hits all the right buttons by playing the main hits and a scattering of new material and album tracks.

To the DVD content: If you are going to do your first ""proper"" DVD concert for the market, why not film your performance for a home town crowd.  That is exactly what Neil Diamond does, so you do get the extra crowd responses when songs with local references are played (Beautiful Noise, Brooklyn Roads, I Am...I Said, etc) and allows a natural lead-in to the documentary that follows Neil back to his old home and neighbourhood.  The concert is a good balance of material and well paced - Neil is still in great voice and his long serving band can't be faulted.  It also helps when everyone on stage appears to be enjoying the show as much as the capacity crowd.  With such a large back catalogue of material there is probably someone's favourite song that has been omitted (""Soolaimon"" for me) but it would have be a pretty pedantic person to complain about the track listing - of the 26 tracks at least 17 would make it on to a greatest hits package.  (The tracks have already been listed elsewhere, so I won't duplicate this here.)

It has been a long wait for a Neil Diamond concert DVD to hit the market but nothing is left out - you get the full 2-hour show (none of this advertised ""full concert"", then as a DVD extra you get bonus tracks that are obviously taken from the same show).  In short, if you are a Neil Diamond fan you need this DVD in your collection - you will not be disappointed.",1251331200,4,1665,4.400651465798045
4043092,5,B0030BOCE6,"Having attended many Neil Diamond concerts since 1976, I was prepared to be entertained by a master showman showcasing his incredible music.  This is what music legends are made of.  I have always loved the quality of the ND band.  Their sound is awesome.  All of the songs except a couple of the newer ones were very familiar to the audience.  Brother Love responds graciously to the audience for their love of his music and performance.  This is a top quality concert that you should not miss.  The Madison Square Garden audience certainly enjoyed it, as you will also.  The concert lasts 2 hours, and should be viewed in its entirety in one sitting for the truely emotional impact it will have on you.  Highly recommended.",1250812800,2,725,4.690476190476191
4043093,5,B0030BOCE6,"Superb concert!  Neil Diamond looks and sounds great!  His voice has not changed!  This DVD was recorded in 2008.  The quality of the DVD is absolutely perfect in audio and video!  He sang ALL his oldies, EXCEPT Hello Again, Shilo, Desiree, Longfellow Serenade, Heartlight, and September Morn.  The audience at Madison Square Garden was clearly delighted!.  I've been waiting for this since the Neil Diamond, Greatest Hits Live DVD of 1988 and I certainly was NOT disappointed!

In the ""Welcome Home Neil"" segment on the DVD, Neil Diamond revisits his childhood neighborhood and home in Brooklyn.  It was cute that when he chatted with four African-American guys in their late teens, they ""didn't have a clue"" who he was.  Later he chatted with his team and planned the concert.",1250640000,9,1475,4.923076923076923

I saw Neil live in concert, once in the 70's in Texas and 3 times in Wisconsin in the 80's and 90's and he consistently puts on a fantastic show. Although this concert is from 2008 his voice  and stage presence is as strong as ever.  I wish there was a DVD of the original Hot August Night in Los Angeles at the Greek Theater in 1972.  But after all of this, this DVD is awesome.",1512777600,,430,4.144578313253012

Being the romantic I am the duet with Linda Press, You Don't Bring Me Flowers, I can only say wow!!! and I had to watch at least 6 times before moving on! I saw in other comments there is consideration that the original Hot August Night concert at the Greek Theater in LA on August 1972 might make it to DVD player--I'm not sure why it has taken so long for it to get to DVD but hurry up already--I'm sure the technolgy is available to do it, please.",1488758400,,681,4.166666666666667

4043173,1,B0030BOCE6,"The performance is great; much better than Neil's Las Vegas concerts. However, the DVD video cut out at the end of 'Play Me,' (frame #5). I tried again, from the start and got to 'I Am, I Said,' which played but then cut out the video only. I can't come to a conclusion because my best DVD/CD player (Sony DVP S-360) is very sensitive and won't play worn DVD's; only the ones I purchase new. I'll try the DVD on my other DVD (also a Sony) which is not as high quality but always plays DVD's entirely. I never have problems on CD's, just video on DVD's. If you have any recommendations, I would appreciate it. The player is clean and all DVD's are cleaned before I rent them or check out of the library.

I will try the Diamond DVD on the lower quality Sony DVD player and see how it works. Perhaps, the Sony DVD S-360 is defective.

The performance, however, is outstanding, including the sound quality but I have an excellent Sony surround sound. I don't plan to ask for a replacement or refund.",1414800000,,996,4.320855614973262

This performance was well after Neil passed his vocal prime.  It's the ""shouting Neil"" rather than the ""singing Neil"".  To compound the problem, the audio is poorly recorded and mixed.  Absolutely not worth buying.",1365206400,5,481,4.666666666666667

While I enjoyed this Album very much, I was TRYING to get Neil's ORIGINAL HOT AUGUST NIGHT ALBUM, RECORDED LIVE, AT THE GREEK THEATER IN LA. many years ago, ON A DVD. UNFORTUNATELY, it was only available on VHS. I think it would be very smart of his Producers, if they would somehow get this ""Original"" ""Hot August Night"" from those early years and MARKET IT ON A DVD. I will keep hoping that this will happen before I die!",1356912000,3,655,4.368852459016393

This was not produced in HD, either with camera or sound. When it first starts my receiver showed a digital 5.1 signal, that lasted about a minute, than it went to just stereo and stayed there the rest of the concert. The jacket says ""experience high definition"" and on the back it mentions 5.1 Dolby True Surround Sound. Simply not true. If you enjoy Neil, as I do, get this DVD, notice I did not say Blue Ray, if you want a great sound experience, you will be disappointed.

4043262,2,B0030BOCE6,"The song selection and the quality of the video is very good but overshadowed by the extremely poor audio. Of the 70+ concert and music DVD's and Blu-Rays that I own, this is by far the worst 5.1 mix in my collection.  I should also mention that my sound system is not an inexpensive one, it's of very high quality.

Examples of the poor audio quality of this Blu-Ray include:  With back-up singers being shown on one side of the screen, their voices at times come out of the opposite speakers; the instruments are very muffled and indistinguishable; the surrounds are used to amplify the crowd noise rather than simply providing ambiance and presence; there is no depth and warmth.  One reviewer stated that most of the audio comes out of the center channel, I disagree, there is no center channel!  The audio would have been so much better had the center channel been used.

I am not a fan of the director, Hamish Hamilton.  He directed the DVD's for U2's Elevation and Vertigo tours and a very common complaint of those two DVD's is that the scenes change every four seconds or so.

Really not sure how to qualify him as either pop, soft rock, or maybe a combination of the 2.  Yet his unique style and voice should remain strong for many generations.  Live in NY is a great way to view his talent.  Songs from all aspects of his career.  If you are a Neil Diamond fan be sure to give this a view or if you enjoy some of his music, it might be worth a view as well.

If you remember Neil Diamond on the radio during the '70's, you'll love this. It's hard to believe that a performer could actually improve with age; especially aging 'rock' performers...Mr Diamond has added many more facets to his best known songs as well as re-arranging these gems into even more entertaining, updated versions. His band and singers are phenomenal. I would have paid 4X for this dvd...it's THAT good. BUY IT! You won't regret it.",1320710400,,582,4.83

I bought this DVD for my brother (also a HUGE fan) and then for myself after I saw Mr. Diamond recently in Mannheim, Germany. The joy this singer generates with his live performances is indescribable. Watching the audience sing along to ""Sweet Caroline"" on the DVD was only surpassed by actually doing it at the concert. The original ""Hot August Night"" album was, and still is, a showcase for this singer's enormous talent. This performance at Madison Square Garden only proves that some things never age. He is now 70 years old and can still bring tens of thousands to their feet in a thrilling celebration of music. Thank you, Neil Diamond, for a lifetime of ""Beautiful Noise""!!",1314403200,,764,4.7518796992481205

I enjoyed his older songs, including the songs that dealt with his upbringing in Brooklyn, New York.  It really has a historical and nostalgic feeling hearing his songs.  If you are a Diamond fan, I recommend this blu-ray and if not, you should add this video to your music collection.

Some people complained about the sound; I just played the disc on the high def TV and listened through the TV's regular speakers and it sounded and looked good enough for me.",1313452800,,601,4.4363636363636365

Not my favorite DVD, but certainly not the worst either. I haven't seen any other ND concert DVD's and have never been to a ND concert so I couldn't compare this one vs another...

I'll agree with an earlier reviewer that the audio quality is not superb, though more than adequate- (perhaps the reviewer's audio system is not set up well, or he pushed the wrong buttons on the remote & channeled all the sound to the center). When I select the multichannel option I have to turn my Sony Amp's volume as high as 35 to get the volume I desire.

I actually shut down my system after the first few lines. I had watched the entire video until then, eagerly looking forward to drowning in his rendition of ""Song Sung Blue""....... the less said the better. I am going to stick to the Good 'ol ND and my CD's. I have over 50 DVD concert's from Rock to Blues. This is the very first concert that I feel like throwing away.

Shot by Hamish Hamilton,Hot August Night:NYC gives us a glimpse of the 2008 Tour in front of a hometown crowd who is in love with the entertainer. The show capures twenty-eight songs in just over two hours as Diamond takes us through most of his catalogue from his earliest hits to his latest Home Before Dark material. Backed by the band that has supported him for the past thirty years or so Diamond makes it look easy. The high point of the show is a rousing mid set Sweet Caroline that has the entire arena on its feet.

The only bonus feature is Neil Diamond Coming Home which takes the singer back to his old  Brooklyn neighborhood and apartment fifty years later.

This is a worthwhile DVD to watch if you have an interest in one of America's most known singer songwriters.",1278374400,36,1086,4.46969696969697
4043285,5,B0030BOCE6,This is the first time I've seen a Blu Ray DVD in a concert environment with surround sound. I was blown away. I hope more performers consider doing it. I've been a big fan of Mr. Diamond for years so I may be a tad bias. I have a Samsung full HD LCD TV and a Panasonic Blu Ray player. MY surround sound configuration has separate components as apposed to the out of the box home theater system.,1274832000,,395,4.076923076923077
4043286,3,B0030BOCE6,"While I was excited to be able to see & hear Neil Diamond on my Blu-ray player, I have to admit it was the old hits I grew up with that I was expecting to hear.  Where he belted 'em out with power and passion.  The songs with heart.

What I got, was disappointment.  Not with the quality of the picture or sound, mind you (though I had read about some issues there...); I was actually disappointed in Neil's Performance.  He seems to have lost some of his power onstage.  Oh, he still has his passion for his music, and it's there in the lyrics, but his presence onstage seemed ""lackluster"".""  Admittedly, I was expecting 70's/80's Neil, and this is just not him.

Now, if they would just remaster & release the Hot August Nights video from the 70's...  THAT would be worth the money.",1273968000,,784,4.3517241379310345
4043287,5,B0030BOCE6,"I have two other  Neil Diamond DVD but this is by far the best!!..The video and audio quality..and the performace are without equal.!! If you are thinking of owning one Neil Diamond DVD, This is the one !!!",1271548800,3,206,4.421052631578948
4043288,5,B0030BOCE6,"I have seen Neil Diamond twice in concert. This blu-ray is almost like being there. I watched it on my 65"" Mitsubushi DLP TV and listened to the great music through my 7.1 sound system. This concert rocks. I recommend this Blu-ray disc to anyone who is a fan or has seen him in person. You won't be sorry.",1271289600,,305,4.186440677966102
4043289,2,B0030BOCE6,The video recording is not worth to be a blu-ray or HD DVD.  Any amateur can do a better audio recording.,1271203200,2,105,4.0
4043290,5,B0030BOCE6,"First off, let me say this, never mind what else you've read, this blu ray disc's surround audio is very good, not perfect but say a 4 or a 4 1/2 out of 5. I played it on a PS 3 connected HDMI to a digital amp with ability to decode the usual and the more recent audio formats and have this to report. The LPCM 2.0 output played through the stereo mode of the amp is satisfactory but nothing to shout about -- stable sound imaging, but congested with slightly boomy bass at higher volume. The Dolby True HD 5.1 output when I perversely played it through the 2 channel mode of the amp sounded worse. The sound was muffled with poor stereo image and sounded awful enough for me to switch off in a hurry. But this same True HD 5.1.output when properly decoded and played through the 5.1. mode of the amp brought back the smile to my face. The differential output through the various speakers varies of course with the track played but generally is about 20-25% each from R and L front, 15-20% subwoofer, 10-15% each from R and L rear speakers and only 10-15% from the central speaker. Despite this timid output from the centre however, the stereo imaging from the 2 front speakers is excellent and the vocals from Diamond and the backup singers are easily discernible even with the full band playing, down to the last p's and t's and sibilants. This type of mix is much preferable to one with a strong centre speaker output which overwhelms and destroys the stereo illusion (for audiophiles getting a centre speaker is akin to getting the bubonic plague). The interesting thing about this particular 5.1 mix is that whilst it uses the centre sparingly as an in between ""filler"", it uses it more as an ambience channel. Listen to tracks with strong audience noise like claps and whistles and sing-alongs and you'll notice strong ambient noise coming from the centre. This, I think is to convey the illusion of sitting in the front row facing the stage in the gold fish bowl that is Madison Square Garden where of course the ambient noise surrounds you 360 degrees ! Good sound then and not a bad sound stage either.
The video quality is more of a mixed bag. When the lighting is just right you get the high def picture you expect from a blu ray but oftentimes when Diamond moves to a darker area the picture is noticeably softer and some long shots of the audience in poor light show up fuzzy and grainy. A 4 out of 5 perhaps.
But nitpicking aside it is the performance that matters most, and man can this guy perform ! Whether it is in the all out sock-it-to-'em numbers such as Holly Holly, Cherry Cherry, Crunchy Granola Suite and Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show, or in the declamatory I am...I Said, or the syrupy Sweet Caroline or the intimate You Don't Bring Me Flowers, Neil Diamond sizzles, the band is hot and the audience laps everything up clamoring for more, more. What a night. Diamond seldom ever disappoints in a live concert, and this performance is a real gem, 5 carats and all of flawless.",1270857600,20,3012,4.498175182481752

Many years ago Neil Diamond recorded a CD, Hot August Night at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. May of his fans feel that this was his best preformance ever.

This new Blu-Ray captures the magic of the original and presents in with great HDTV and 5.1 Sound.

For Neil Diamond fans this is as good as it gets.",1270771200,,578,6.783783783783784
4043292,3,B0030BOCE6,"I agree with ""Billy."" It defaulted to two channel audio and when I switched to Dolby TrueHD, I was disappointed.

I was also disappointed by the ""filming,"" rather than video like the Elton John and Moody Blues Blu-ray DVDs.

All that technical complaining aside, my wife LOVED the concert, and she has been a Neil Diamond fan for decades and has seen him live MANY times.

The bonus 23 minutes was interesting. He goes back to where he grew up as an early teen.",1269475200,3,461,4.464285714285714
4043293,3,B0030BOCE6,"I own Neil Diamond Live in Australia 1976, Live Greatest Hits 1988 and now this one from 2008.  All 3 show Neil at distinctly different stages of his career, all with the same band and background singers.  Its interesting to see all 3 and compare.  He's great in all 3 and he's schmaltzy in all 3 to some degree.  He always has his charm and always has his very enthusiastic fans.  This is good.  Very good sometimes.  But, in this one, he and his band are showing their age a bit, and sometimes its not very flattering.  But.. They're out there and they're doing it and they're giving it their all which is impressive in its own right.  And the song choices and the special feature of Neil going home show a reflective and bright person trying to show his appreciation for his past, his present and his future.  I'd recommend getting all 3 if you are a fan of Neil.  (I would not recommend getting the audio versions of Neil live though - too much hokey audience participation that is best appreciated in video, but not audio only.)",1268524800,17,1033,4.412698412698413
4043294,5,B0030BOCE6,"I have ""loved"" Neil Diamond since I can remember.  I am from the era when he wrote songs for others...then himself.  I have also been priviledged to see him in concert in NJ about 12 years ago and it was awesome.

His music is timeless and his shows are happy, upbeat and involve the audience.  He is a win, win all the way.

If you love good music, this is some of his best!  Enjoy =)",1267747200,3,385,4.0
4043295,4,B0030BOCE6,"First of all I am a lifelong Neil Diamond fan. I saw this exact concert here in Denver. The great thing about this DVD/Blu-ray is that it is the only video I am aware of where we have a complete Neil Diamond concert. So I will rate in 3 categories.
Performance - Neil has been around for some time now. It has been awhile since the first Hot August Night. But luckily, he was in great voice for this concert. Much better than when I saw him live in Denver. Fans will not be disappointed. Full length concert in hi-def, does not get much better for fans.
Video - I would rate a little lower than I was hoping for here. Not quite as sharp as the best concerts, and some cameras were not as focused as others. But on most TVs, this will be a very pleasant picture.
Audio - again I have some minor issue here. Another review indicated the sound on the true 5.1 track is mostly center channel and almost no rears. Not sure how his system is set up, but that is not the case. The Blu-ray and DVD 5.1 tracks seem to be mastered about the same. The center channel is actually barely used. Vocal comes out of both left and right mains. Sound stage is all in front. Rears are fully engaged but used for arena ambience and crowd noise. Overall the sound is good, but vocals should be in the center channel, and overall sound is not quite as dynamic as the best concerts videos.

All said...a must for Neil Diamond fans.",1267488000,24,1408,4.214814814814815
4043296,5,B0030BOCE6,"One of the best blu of my collection. First of all don't trust what they say the video format is 1.78 and not 1.33 the PQ is outstanding,you can throw away your SD DVD as I did with mine. Regarding the audio TRUE HD 5.1 this is a huge improvement if you have a good subwoofer then yo'll understand what I mean. Neil deserved this blu ray and yes the documentary (23 minutes) is also in full HD picture is GREAT a must have for a music lover.__",1265932800,2,443,4.045454545454546
4043297,5,B0030BOCE6,"Finally, they decided to bring out a Bluray copy of Neil Diamond and its great that it is being initiated with the MSG concert in 2008. I have a copy of the newly released DVD and the picture is great to start with. I get a fantastic quality from my Panasonic Bluray player, but some sections like those showing the crowd reactions seem to be full of whitish grains !! cannot understand why. Hopefully, this will be resolved in the Bluray disc.

Will write my final review once it comes out !",1265846400,,492,4.3478260869565215
4043298,5,B0030BOCE6,"Superb concert! Neil Diamond looks and sounds great! His voice has not changed! This DVD was recorded in 2008. The quality of the DVD is absolutely perfect in audio and video! He sang ALL his oldies, EXCEPT Hello Again, Shilo, Desiree, Longfellow Serenade, Heartlight, and September Morn. The audience at Madison Square Garden was clearly delighted!. I've been waiting for this since the Neil Diamond, Greatest Hits Live DVD of 1988 and I certainly was NOT disappointed!

Cherry, Cherry
Shilo
Sweet Caroline
Hello Again
September Morn
Forever in Blue Jeans
Play Me
Pretty Amazing Grace
Love on the Rocks

In the ""Welcome Home Neil"" segment on the DVD, Neil Diamond revisits his childhood neighborhood and home in Brooklyn. It was cute that when he chatted with four African-American guys in their late teens, they ""didn't have a clue"" who he was. Later he chatted with his team and planned the concert.",1264982400,51,973,5.037267080745342

Included are visits with people on the street and a visit inside the apartment he lived in fifty years ago.  The crowd at Madison Square Garden is very enthusiastic throughout the concert.
