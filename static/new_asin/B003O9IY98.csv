4161771,5,B003O9IY98,"What I Can Tell You: Although I am not in love with the title, this was a beautifully done movie. Truly moving in so many ways. It is so visually appealing and real I could smell the salt air and the scratchiness of their sweaters.

The acting by Aidan Quinn, Connie Nielsen and John Bell (Tomas) was stellar. The only one I am familiar with is Aidan and thought his silent, strong, loving, desperate, character, Alec was brilliantly played.

Connie Nielsen's Marie was amazing. She is beautiful, mesmerizing and full of heart. She is everything you would wish for if you were a child like Tomas in need of love.  I was unaware of the many films I have seen with her. Her impact from this movie will make me remember her forever.

John Bell's Tomas was unbelievable. My heart ached for him. He is like Oliver Twist, full of heartbreak, tears, fears and completely capable of love even after being in an orphanage and teased. He is a gentle soul who Marie falls completely in love with.

There is so much to say about this movie but I don't want to give anything away. While I saw where the movie was headed 20 minutes in, it is the journey to the end that makes this a must see.

My throat ached from sobbing through much of the movie. Not because the storyline is heartbreaking but because the acting was so strong, you felt all the emotions of the characters even when it had nothing to do with the lines of a script.

There is so much to love about this movie. The love of Marie and Alec! The love of Marie and Tomas. The way Marie sees the world and how she shares herself with others. The magic of a mother's love even when you are not biologically bound to them.  The wonderment of color and how it adds to our lives in the simplest way, and the fantasy of rainbows and the beauty it holds both visually and spiritually.

A MUST SEE!",1298678400,89,1839,4.3226744186046515
4161772,5,B003O9IY98,"Set in the natural beauty of Corrie Island on the breathtaking west coast of Ireland, this uplifting story uncovers a troubled orphan's journey of self discovery, and the healing power of love  and the miracles of nature. Outstanding performances by 10 year old John Bell playing the lonely orphan Tomas, and Connie Nielson playing the extraordinary, kind, loving, joyful Maire, make you want to be a better person. It is a story about the transformational healing of a lonely boy, his new stepmom Maire, and a reluctant stepfather played brilliantly by Aiden Quinn.",1275004800,29,566,5.086021505376344

4161777,3,B003O9IY98,"I bought the Region 4 from Australian eBay, the 4 movie trailers are not for small kids. The movie starts with the boy being mistreated and rejected by school kids in an orphanage to being immediately rejected by his foster dad - and the atmosphere of insecurity and fear in the young boy's mind  - it has several scary scenes followed by a very sad death scene and is more for adult suitability.

For those who like a moral story in a movie, you may really like it. I would be careful for young impressionable minds. Too much tragedy.
But I will fast forward past the first part and see it again, I like the way father and child are brought together at the end of this story. Usually, I like pleasant viewing rather than serious but there are some endearing moments.

PS: Lighting is somewhat dim but I think that has something to do with being produced in Ireland - could be improved on your TV screen.",1487203200,,904,4.369047619047619

Then a brightly colored lady comes into the orphanage and the boy's life turns to rainbows. The cinematography also turns all bright and happy. If you like unique movies than sure this is for you, but it was definitely not my forte. The acting didn't hold my attention, I was just so distracted by what was going on around the characters.

4161835,4,B003O9IY98,"A sweet little charmer but, dare I say, a tad overrated? Please forgive me! ;) After reading such glowing reviews and how much it was recommended, I bought this movie for a 5-year-old girl, before I'd screened it myself.  So, when finally able to see it after the fact, as I was watching it, I gradually began to wonder if a certain sad thing was going to happen in the movie and, honestly, I cringed when it did.  But I won't give away this part of the storyline which, I felt, was too sad for very young children, perhaps under 10 years old.  The film, still, more than compensates as fine, above-average family fare (I've been an Aidan Quinn fan for decades), though it's not necessarily as brilliant and life-changing as some of the reviews state (not to mention an unexpectedly subpar DVD transfer).",1423526400,7,804,4.569444444444445

Thomas is a young orphaned boy who is afraid of everything.  He is adopted by a couple on an Irish island.  Through love and kindness you see him evolve from frightened young boy who stutters to a happy youngster.
Disaster occurs when the loving mother passes and it is up to him and his adopted father to make things right and show their love.

4161864,5,B003O9IY98,"Based on an Irish children's book, this is the rare family film that blends a pitch-perfect sense of whimsy -- featuring beautiful location footage of the gorgeous green Irish island where it takes place -- with realistic family interactions told from a young boy's point of view. More impressively, it does so without descending into the fantasies and special effects-driven dream worlds so favored by American children's films. Aidan Quinn and Connie Nielsen (nailing the accent) play two working-class parents who adopt a shy young boy from a Catholic orphanage. The film depicts in beautiful and subtle ways their painful growth into a family, with some surprising and touching moments along the way.

4161896,3,B003O9IY98,"Why is it that every great family oriented movie that is released, with a clean story, potentially great for the kids, winds up with someone who dies in the movie?  I reviewed this movie for a possible family night gathering, where my brothers, mother, and 2 young nieces would be watching this for an evening of family entertainment.  The movie had scenery that was out of this world!  The acting was great!  The story was slow, very slow, but clean, and a welcome change of pace.  I thought for sure, hands down, this movie was a winner, until the mother dies!  The boy ends up screaming his guts out in tears, they have the funneral where they carry her away in a coffin, and so on.  There is no way that I would show this movie to 2 young girls, and explain to them that this is an evening of joyful family entertainment.  The movie is great, the scenery, breath-taking, story is slow, but clean.  It even rebounds after the death of his mother, with a great ending.  I would give this 6 out of 5 stars, if it wasn't for the death in the middle, which knocked the wind out of the entire movie. It's a real shame.  The movie had so much potential!  The death scene and funeral really took the movie on a 90 degree turn down a different path.  Amazing!  I had to settle for 3 stars because of this.

They say hind-sight is 20/20.  Well, in my opinion, what would have made this movie a 5 star movie:  The author of the book, or the people who did the screen write for the movie should have had the mother come down with a serious illness that needed an operation.  It might even seem that only a miracle could save her.  Send her off to a hospital on the mainland, leaving the boy with the husband, leaving them bond together into a stronger relationship.  Then the boy visits his mother, and his passion for her inspires her to want to recover.  The operation she undergoes saves her, and she returns back to their island home, united, together, as one family.

There is so much death in this world.  When I bring my family together, especially 2 young girls, for a night of family oriented entertainment, the last thing I want to see on the big screen is more death and tragedy!  Why?  Again, this movie had all the makings of a beautiful family movie; one for all to see and get absorbed into.  The movie changed after the death scene; changed in mood, changed in atmosphere, everything changed.  Toward the end, it was like watching a different movie.",1338854400,21,2457,4.378318584070796

4161900,4,B003O9IY98,"This is a foreign film in the very best sense of the word; it approaches life and living in a way outside of the typical mold of domestic productions. This made the movie very intriguing for us and quickly captured our imaginations with its fresh newness.

A Shine of Rainbows is a fascinating film in many ways; first of all it is a tender love story of a woman's love for her adopted son and his growing love for her as the mother he needed and wanted so badly. Secondly the setting on the rugged Irish coast establishes a harsh environment in which this love must grow; one can feel the bite of the wind and taste the saltiness in the air.

It makes the viewer feel as if they had personally experienced the location and could imagine how the orphan, Tomas, played by John Bell, felt when first taken to this remote place.

The acting is uniformly high caliber and always contributes to the progress of the story. My wife and I were both greatly impressed by Bell's acting and quickly identified with him and sympathized with his plight.

The role of the mother, Marie, is beautifully played by Connie Nielsen; her gentle portrayal of the mother reminds one of a beautiful, delicate flower growing amidst the rocks of that harsh Irish coast. The role of the father, Alec, is effectively played by Aidan Quinn.

This is a moving story which both of us enjoyed. It can have an impact on the viewer which will last; I know it did for us. It introduced us to an area and a way of life that is totally different from anything either of us have ever known; that alone made it a worthy way to spend the evening.

4161902,5,B003O9IY98,"The long and short of it:

(Short first: If you will take my recommendation and watch this movie, you will write me a letter of thanks. It will stick to spiritual ribs like a meal catered by heavenly hosts. In snippets of scenes it teaches a graduate course in parenting. In its short silent sermon it will build a church for the god of love that you get to take home with you when you walk away.

Here is how and why the movie does it (the long of it):

""A Shine of Rainbows"" is delightfully better than one intuits from its crayon-colorful title. Based on a book by Lillian Beckwith (English non-fiction-turned-Irish fiction writer, deceased 2004 at age 87) it was never released in the U.S. This says a whole lot more about the U.S. box office and its audience than it does about the movie, which though low budget, became an award-reaping sleeper turned hit all over English-speaking Europe. It is a conservatively-faceted, polished and perfect gem. I rented it for free at the library, but it's available on NetFlix and Amazon (to buy). I suggest buying it. You'll want to own...and share it with those your love.

If I had the bucks I'd buy American distribution rights and send it to independent down-town theaters, because the cinematography of those tall rocky shores and rainy sunsets on Irish isles (with the title-touted rainbows of course) cry out for expansive cinematic scope. But that didn't keep me from being transported to the shoots' magic venues on my little DVD-fed TV screen.

OK, so I'm swept away. Had to watch it twice even though (perhaps because) the first viewing brought me such vivid flashbacks of my own ""mother's love"" that it was like the pain you feel the day after you've drunk too much great vintage - when only the hair of that very dog can nurse the hangover and put you back on track.

Yeah, there's ecstatic sadness in this flick. But they give you fair warning about the plot's direction and although I'm an inveterate ""sunset"" happy-ending sort of audience, there's no way I'll dub this a ""sad movie."" It transcends both sadness and happiness and sweeps us to the vantage point we gladly concede they only seemingly come to us in separate (temporal) bundles. And in this movie, there is infinitely more positive--than negative--human experience you empathetically walk away with after watching ""A Shine..."", and I submit it (the experience) will remain a part of that bundle of myriad inarticulable reasons you keep saying to yourself every day you live, ""It is worth it.""

I don't want to tell you much if anything of the tale. It is as simple as any parable in literature or lore. And as complex in its explorations, implications and inquisitions: How long does love have to manifest itself and abide in our lives in the physical beings and worldly doings of those we love and who love us in order for that love to sustain us by being what we (for want of enlightenment) term ""true love."" This movie, however simple the script, gives us ... an answer.

In the flick (this is all I'll tell you) a Danish beauty (Connie Nielson--remember the gorgeous Danish actress who plays Joakim Phoenix' sister in ""Gladiator"") plays the wife of Aidan Quinn in this Canadian produced, Irish-located (2008) flick you likely never heard of. They are childless, love each other, and she (more than he) wants to and does adopt an 8-year old boy from an orphanage and take him to live (on a trial basis) on an Irish isle where they lead a subsistence life raising chickens, sheep and fishing the rocky coast.

In ""Shoes of the Fisherman"" Anthony Quinn (coincidence) plays a freshly-elected Pope who yearns to comingle again with the masses and so takes a walk through the back streets of Rome to enjoy again the pleasure of more proximate communion. He chances to meet the female protagonist and during his counseling with her (in the guise of a priest) she confesses that she and her husband are estranged. She's in the company of her paramour. Quinn asks her what went wrong with her marriage and she replies, ""We were in love...before, but we lost it"". I'll never forget Quinn's reply. ""You say you lost ... your love for one another. When did you last see it?""

The last time I saw what I believe to be ""true love"" it was in this movie. I'm not taking Faulkner's--or any other person's word for the truth as I see it - that truth is perhaps more aptly written and gleaned from great fiction than either history or professionally-published ""news."" I think I learned the lesson in reading, writing and watching artists struggling to capture what love ""is"" in expressions of creative art. This movie is one of those expressions.

If anybody gets moved to enjoy this flick on my say-so, please let me know if you have a similar experience. And PS- The ""special features"" (bonus section of the DVD) on the making of this low-budget flick is a story I found almost as riveting and uplifting as the film itself.

Best,

4161903,5,B003O9IY98,"Set on Corrie Island, Ireland in the early 1960's, A SHINE OF RAINBOWS is the story about an orphan boy named Tomas who is adopted by a woman named Maire (Connie Nielsen) and her husband Alec (Aidan Quinn). Tomas (John Bell) has always been a bit of an outcast. He sees the beauty in what others consider mundane, but also has difficulty speaking.  He is vilified by the other boys because he is not normal. Maire and Alec are unable to have a child of their own and Maire selects Tomas to be her son. Life on Corrie is much different than at the orphanage on the mainland, but Tomas adapts to it well. He has people who love him, he is surrounded by beauty and nature, and he begins to overcome his speaking problem. Maire adores Tomas and he loves her and shortly after arriving begins calling her Mum. Alec likes the boy and shows little moments of affection, but he can't quite bring himself to call Tomas his son (most clearly evidenced by his refusal to sign Tomas's adoption papers). A tragedy occurs and Tomas new life rushes toward oblivion.

I had never heard of A SHINE OF RAINBOWS until about a year ago when I saw a trailer for it on the DVD of I AM. The trailer really intrigued me.

The acting in the movie is amazing. Aidan Quinn plays a role different from many he has played in the past. Connie Nielsen is superb as Maire and gives an Oscar-worthy performance. However, it is the young John Bell as Tomas who is the standout star of the film. If this was a major movie marketed in America, Bell would have won all sorts of awards and accolades. Just as A SHINE OF RAINBOWS revolves around Tomas, the other actors in the film seem to take their cue from Bell and all of them give great performances.

The other thing that is so remarkable about A SHINE OF RAINBOWS is the cinematography. Color plays a major element in the film. Shot a different way, A SHINE OF RAINBOWS could have had a very different tone and mood. However, director and writer Vic Sarin brought the story to life by filling it with the perfect balance of color. I realize that this use of color is symbolic (representing the love and hope that is brought into Tomas life), but it could have either been overused or not used enough. In short, it's one of the best shot movies I have seen in a long time.

Some might find the overall plot of A SHINE OF RAINBOWS to be clichd. I realize the overall plot is one that is used rather frequently. However, A SHINE OF RAINBOWS has such strong characters and is shot so well, that it mostly avoids the clichs of similarly plotted films.

Conflicts occur, an animatronic baby seal needs to be fed, Toms needs to come out of his shell, his mother gets sick, rainbows fall out of the sky and are sparkly, and once again, did I mention there was a cute baby seal? It is clearly a family film and based on a book. You can watch this with your kids and all enjoy it, but there is one scene where the kid is basked in the glow of a sparkly rainbow that made me groan (went a little too far, folks). I didn't even mind the fake baby seal, it was still cute. The story is filled with clichs, but they seem to be overlooked in light of the fact that the story takes place in the sixties in Ireland, a fantastical land where anything can happen. John Bell is an obvious newcomer to film, he can pore on the hysterics in an emotional scene, but in regular everyday scenes comes off as REALLY stiff and the stammering is unnatural. He has potential though so he just needs to keep at it.

Overall, A SHINE OF RAINBOWS has a somewhat predictable plot, but the film's strong acting and splendid cinematography make it a must see film.

The DVD features a promo for FoxFaith films, a trailer for the movie LIKE DANDELION DUST, and a 48-minute documentary entitled ""So Many Colours: The Making of A SHINE OF RAINBOWS.""  The documentary is narrated by producer Tina Pehme and features some interviews with director Vic Sarin. The short documentary provides a good overview of the filming process from location scouting, auditioning, casting, actual filming, and the creation of the animatronic seal named Smudge.",1319673600,34,4122,4.420289855072464

4161907,5,B003O9IY98,"Most people here say there is a lot of cliche in this movie, but they miss the important picture! In today's media, we expect too much! We assume movies have to be loaded with heavy information, sarcasm, irony, difficult scenery and so on. But in reality, good stories that touched a man's heart throughout centuries, have been those with simple messages!

This particular movie touched my heart with its simplicity more than any other heavy loaded movie could ever do! It really just kind of went into my cold heart and turned everything upside down with the innocence and purity of a childlike perspective!

This movie is the first ever that made me cry through the entire half! Those were tears of a breakthrough for me. Mostly because I could resonate with the main character, the orphaned boy. While I am not an orphaned myself, I have been too attached to my mother. In the movie the boy falls in purest love with his new mom, a very kind-hearted woman who adopts him. And just like the boy, I never had a good relationship with my father. Basically, the story is that of letting go of attachment with one person, and healing a relationship with another. This concept nailed it on the head for me! I could have never even imagined that I could actually be closer to my father than I thought!

Watch this movie to understand what I mean by all this. I would not want to spoil too much. If you watch the movie, and it does not speak to you in a any way, please don't write harsh reviews on how there are cliches or unrealistic situations, because miracles DO happen and life brings amazing surprises to those who are opened to it!

Because of this film, I decided to post-pone my graduation until next fall. Instead, I am going to spend my Spring semester with my father back in the state where he and my mom live. I used to blame him for many things, thinking it was always his fault that we were never too close. But now I see that he may have actually been there for me more than I realize. No matter how the situation will unravel, I will be opened to the relationship aspect with him and to get the most out of it as possible!

I would encourage anyone who've had a difficult relationship with their father, or were orphaned at some point in their life, or even parents who have difficulties connecting to their children, to watch this movie with an opened mind! It's in the simple stories that we find the greatest wisdom!",1316908800,48,2432,4.443946188340807

4161909,5,B003O9IY98,One of the very best movies I've seen in a long time. And Ireland is the stunning background for the story. Everyone of the characters in the movie was outstanding. A must see.,1315440000,,176,4.363636363636363
4161910,5,B003O9IY98,"A shy, stuttering 8-year-old boy moves from the orphanage he's lived in since the death of his grandmother to an Irish island with his adoptive, free-spirited woman and her cold, silent husband.  The story that unfolds is about both the boy and the husband coming out of their shells and learning to express and value what's important in their lives.

THE GOOD:  The performances of every single actor in the film stand out.  Particularly the child actors do an extraordinary job.  The emotional fabric of the film is wonderful.  You have to be touched if you have any emotions at all!  The cinematography is jaw-dropping-gorgeous, owing mostly to the beautiful Irish setting.

THE BAD:  There's no way around the simplicity of the script; you know everything that's going to happen long, long before it actually happens.  In most films, this would be crippling; however, here it doesn't really matter because the story's about the characters, not the plot.

THE VERDICT:  Heart-warming, beautiful, emotional, and family-friendly.  You should most certainly watch this.",1309564800,,1069,5.181286549707602
4161911,3,B003O9IY98,"This movie was pretty decent.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll buy because while it had good moments, it didn't really follow through.
I will say this: they didn't follow the typical, done-to-death method of storytelling where something extremely tragic happens and that's the most important part of the film.  I'd say the focus was more on the positive side of things.",1306627200,2,371,5.065573770491803
4161912,4,B003O9IY98,"I received this movie for a review. At first I thought it was going to be the cliche-ridden Christian film about a mother who loves her son, a father who isn't quite comfortable around him, and how the two men find love.

While I wouldn't call this a blatant Christian film, I was correct on the other points.

A Shine of Rainbows is about how Maire (Connie Nielsen) wants to adopt a boy. Her husband, Alec (Aidan Quinn) sends her off to make the choice. At the orphanage, Maire finds and selects Tomas (John Bell) a boy who is tenderhearted and nervous around men.

The home life is a challenge as Maire does everything she can to make Tomas feel welcomed and loved while Alec is unsure of having such a ""weak"" boy.

In time, Tomas makes friends and they go off on adventures. He makes friends with an orphaned seal and they created a special bond.

The actors are fine in their roles. It's good to see Aidan Quinn out of the woodwork, and the locations were fantastic (the isles of Ireland).

Then the cliches come in full force and I don't want to spoil for you. But I will say, it's a family friendly film and it does have a good ending. The message is positive as well although not as ""Christian"" as I was led to believe.",1305244800,5,1226,4.308695652173913
4161913,3,B003O9IY98,"""A Shine of Rainbows"" was awarded the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award putting it up in the ranks with ""The Blind Side"" and ""Flipped."" I really enjoyed ""The Blind Side"", I was annoyed by ""Flipped"" so that's where I'm coming from reviewing THIS film which takes place in Ireland, has rainbows, an orphan, and a baby seal. It is written and directed by Vic Sarin and stars Connie Nielsen, Aidan Quinn, and John Bell.

First, I recommend putting up the subtitles so you don't miss anything because even though they are speaking English, they are using very strong accents and refer to one of the main characters as ""himself"" in odd situations we normally wouldn't use it in. John Bell plays Tom&aacute;s, an orphan boy picked on in school for helping an imprisoned pigeon. Maire played by Connie Nielsen arrives to adopt him like a colorful angel and whisks him away from the city to the island of Corrie where there are sheep, seals, caves to play in, and giant stones that have legends. The only person not keen on this arrangement is Maire's husband, Alec (often referred to as ""himself""). Alec does not warm up to Tom&aacute;s whom he considers a weakling since the kid is shy and stammers.

Conflicts occur, an animatronic baby seal needs to be fed, Tom&aacute;s needs to come out of his shell, his mother gets sick, rainbows fall out of the sky and are sparkly, and once again, did I mention there was a cute baby seal? It is clearly a family film and based on a book. You can watch this with your kids and all enjoy it, but there is one scene where the kid is basked in the glow of a sparkly rainbow that made me groan (went a little too far, folks). I didn't even mind the fake baby seal, it was still cute. The story is filled with clich&eacute;s, but they seem to be overlooked in light of the fact that the story takes place in the sixties in Ireland, a fantastical land where anything can happen. John Bell is an obvious newcomer to film, he can pore on the hysterics in an emotional scene, but in regular everyday scenes comes off as REALLY stiff and the stammering is unnatural. He has potential though so he just needs to keep at it.

If you need to rent a family movie one night and your kids like seals, try this one. Otherwise I don't really recommend it, it's ok to good, not great.

Bonus Features:

A making-of featurette that lasts over forty minutes long and shows audition footage of the kids and behind-the-scenes with making of the animatronic seal, the giant rocks, the difficulties with weather, and budget meetings. Pretty surprised this DVD didn't have a trailer as an extra. That's pretty rare these days!",1300665600,4,2637,4.543157894736842
