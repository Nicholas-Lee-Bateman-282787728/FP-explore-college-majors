8674288,3,B00MREMJHY,"This is a slide show with maps and photos. I thought I would see a video and more about the navigation of the sailboat. Where the maps were informative, and the comments were good, I was just disappointed that this was something more like a home slide show presentation. Most helpful information was that the charts are inaccurate enough that radar should be considered as a necessary item. The fact they didn't stay in marina's was a wonderful mention also. The engine powered water maker and solar panel sizes was helpful also.",1468800000,,529,4.760869565217392
8674289,5,B00MREMJHY,Mark & Emily Fagan do a great job sharing all the details that are impossible to know to ask until you've been there. This was a great resource to help us plan our trip down to Ensenada and (hopefully) beyond. The helpful hints on what to do when visiting these Mexican cities is also helpful to know how to plan accordingly. Looking forward to more.,1443398400,,350,4.4
8674290,5,B00MREMJHY,"We really enjoyed this video and found it very useful in planning our cruise down Mexico.  My wife and I watched it before we began cruising.  It was very much like getting a detailed, personal briefing from a close, knowledgeable friend with lots of pictures to give you an accurate view.

From watching this, we were able to make certain to stop at places that were of particular interest to us.  Nearly all of these we never would have known about, and would have likely sailed right past, without this video.

Theres a lot more information here than youll find in other guides.  Note, this is not a navigation guide as it doesnt provide waypoints, but that information is easy to get.  This video does an excellent job of telling you what to SEE and DO when you cruise Mexico and that information is not as easy to get.  And it provides additional information about preparing for cruising and weather expectations.

This video is packed with useful insight.  If you're headed to Mexico by boat, you should get this video.  It would even be helpful if you were traveling by air or car.  Your travel experience will be greatly improved.  Ours was.",1413676800,2,1149,4.628712871287129
8674291,5,B00MREMJHY,"If you have not sailed south of San Diego yet, and would like to see how nice the entree into sailing Mexico, this is the DVD for you!  We purchased all three of the Cruising Mexico series that are currently available, and would really like to see more.  These take the anxiety out of the process for one of our members on Molly J, and for the other, it focuses on places we should not miss (but did because we didn't spend enough time researching before we left San Diego).  Well presented, lots of tips, and very informative.  Highly recommended.",1411171200,,548,4.45
8674292,5,B00MREMJHY,"A must have when traveling through Mexico.  Ms. Fagan provides a comprehensive overview of all the great cruising grounds, as well a description of some of the interior tours one can take while visiting Mexico.  Beautiful images with an interesting narrative.",1411084800,,259,5.2926829268292686
8674293,5,B00MREMJHY,"Very inspiring and informative!  The photography is excellent.  Filled with cruising tips, marina details, recommended anchorages, things to do and see including local contacts.  I will use this video as my cruising guide.",1410393600,,222,5.666666666666667
8674294,5,B00MREMJHY,Exceptional value and very informative DVD. Photos and maps were extremely helpful. It was a huge help as we were planning our first voyage to Mexico,1410393600,,149,4.769230769230769
8674295,5,B00MREMJHY,This is a great video! I found it was a wonderful introduction to Ensenada and the North Pacific Coast from a cruiser's point of view with useful tips that helped me plan my cruise. The beautiful photographs highlight many unique areas to explore and enjoy! I recommend this entire series if you are thinking about cruising adventures in Mexico.,1408838400,,345,4.864406779661017
