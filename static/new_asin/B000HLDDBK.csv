8140456,5,B000HLDDBK,"I was mesmerized when this series was broadcast on PBS in the early 1990s.
Randall Balmer offers the viewers an inside look at the practices of the Evangelical religions.
It offers a deep look into the beliefs and activities of religious practices many know little about.
I find it as compelling today as when I first saw it 20 years ago.",1403654400,,338,4.557377049180328
8140457,5,B000HLDDBK,"Mine Eyes Have seen the Glory  is insightful and useful as I study American Evangelicals.  Although they are missional, they tend to lack ecclesiology.",1369872000,,151,5.25
8140458,5,B000HLDDBK,"This documentary is fascinating and provides a great look at the evangelical subculture in America. The only downside is that it is a little too ""90s"" to seem totally up-to-date. Randall Balmer is the top of this field, and this is a great resource for anyone interested in evangelical culture. Very fun.",1179273600,5,304,4.865384615384615
