8374315,3,B002MZ98A4,"I am not fond of silent movies.  I had read a review of the book and wanted to watch a movie made from the book.  The movie followed the basics of the book but did make some, I guess, creative changes.  The plot was similar but, because it is a silent movie, you have to really pay attention to the movie.",1528588800,,305,3.9672131147540983

8374323,5,B002MZ98A4,"I was amazed this movie was silent, I don't know why, it was made in 1917. What can I tell you. Even though it's silent we watched it. I thought it was amazing to see George M Cohan, James Cagney was a good choice to play him in Yanky Doodle Dandy. I've been searching for 7 Keys to Baldpate for sometime, I had the 1930's version on VHS, I saw this and grabbed it. It wasn't the one I was after but it's worth the money. It's funny, yokey, and we enjoyed it.",1316736000,8,459,3.946236559139785
