This story fills in the blanks for me when so many have passed on with the stories. CV 's never forget your history, love your culture share your traditions.

8268801,4,B00188D12C,My husband is cape verdean on both sides but there was so much we didn't know. Through watching the film we learned a lot of history. This film has been passed throught the family and enjoyed by all!,1250726400,2,199,4.2631578947368425
8268802,5,B00188D12C,"The entire video was well produced and for those of us that came up in the era of not knowing who we were as people, well...here it is!  Dr. Andrade-Watkins surely needs to be congratulated on the research done on the video.  HUGE kudos to this writer/producer, for using of our Cape Verdean jewels to share their memories of back in the day.  They, among other contributors, lived what it was like to be a Cape Verdean in Fox Point, New Bedford, among other places in New England.  This is a 'must have' piece of history. I totally enjoyed it and have purchased several videos for friends and family.",1231200000,4,601,4.486238532110092
8268803,5,B00188D12C,"This is a well done documentary of an American story. The people, the neighborhood, the culture, and the ever so ominous power of 'progress'. As an American of Cape Verdean heritage, this is the bridge that connected my being an American, as a CapeVerdean-American. My great-grandfathers were both immigrants here and like many other CapeVerdean immigrants brought many stories and customs to Cape Verde. Watching this documentary made me feel as if I was living 'those moments'. Being from Boston, I've always felt somewhat incomplete as an American from Capeverdean descendant, because I had not been or seen some of the places that were home to my great-grandparents and other earlier Cape-verdean Criolos. This film brought me, my American Story. Our 'story' is an interesting American story. This documentary, is an 'American' story. The life of a community, meaning of family, tainted politics, and human strenght. I Highly recommend this documentary film to anyone interested in American history; particularly in the New England area, and specifically 'Criolos' (CapeVerdeans).Tcheu gratidon,Luis Andrade Tavares

8268804,5,B00188D12C,"This is a fantastic documentary that chronicles the Cape Verdean experience in the New England city of Providence RI. It captures the struggle, rich culture, and eventual displacement of a very close knit community. I am sure that this story, though written about Cape Verdeans, demonstrates and mimics  the issues related to most immigrants and the  communities they establish when first settling in the USA. Well done and worth watching.",1210464000,4,439,5.257142857142857
