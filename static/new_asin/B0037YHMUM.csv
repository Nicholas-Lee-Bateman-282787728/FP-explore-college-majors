8390854,5,B0037YHMUM,A unique insight into a person who had a profound impact on myself and others and was taken away from all of us long before his time.,1402876800,,133,3.962962962962963
8390855,5,B0037YHMUM,"John Lennon is a phenomenon.  His lyrics and inspirations in his BEATLES & PLASTIC ONO productions are amazing and will mystify people for generations to come.  ""Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup"" & ""How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing.""",1393027200,,284,4.549019607843137
8390856,5,B0037YHMUM,"Though the footage of 1960's quality and sound is not great, the content is priceless. It depicted making of John lennon based on publicly available footage. I appreciated number of scenes that showed their true character than PR'd images.

It is amazing to see how he transformed from a self protective immature adult to person who stuck to his guns when he was  challenged by KKK and christian fundies based on out of context comments of challenging christianity with rockroll. His disregard for the money and fame while making decision of parting their ways(from beatles) and his high ideals and innovative ideas for bringing the peace, objective clear thinking while not taking the ownership of peace movement( which will inevitably corrupted by drugs) is amazing. I highly recommend it.",1355270400,,791,5.124031007751938
8390857,5,B0037YHMUM,"I was not familiar with 90% of this footage. I like it for the full-coverage of Lennon's life and personality... From the duration of the Beatles, Lennon's attitude towards the break-up of the band, to his involvement and life in American culture. It is the raw footage that tells this story in itself.

It was no secret John established the Beatles as his own band before they ever had a manager. John was the ring-leader and main spokesman of the group. Unfortunately, he was not a tactful young guy. He was cynical, clearly rebellious and mistrusting of people. He was not a good spokesman, unlike McCartney, who was better able to pander to the public and journalists alike. John consistently got the band in hot water with journalists. Right from the beginning the band worried about John's vulnerability and physical safety. His words were often twisted by interviewers, and used in such a way to undermine the messages of his songs or incite the public.

This documentary shows how John began to make adjustments in his spoken word and interviews to become more effective, protest injustice, and get a message of peace to those who were also growing and changing with his generation.",1338163200,3,1190,4.857142857142857
8390858,3,B0037YHMUM,"The cover is better then the video but worth a purchase for anyone who is in love with the beatles to at least see the footage of John. I wouldn't consider it rare or unseen, but worth the 13.00 to purchase and have someone view it who enjoys watching anything and everything of John Lennon and the bEatles.",1291593600,6,307,4.310344827586207
8390859,5,B0037YHMUM,This dvd included lots of vintage Lennon footage I either hadn't seen in years or had never seen.  It was historically accurate and I would highly recommend it.,1284422400,13,160,4.714285714285714
8390860,3,B0037YHMUM,There is some new footage here...it's worth watching if you are a diehard Lennon fan.,1278201600,10,85,4.733333333333333
