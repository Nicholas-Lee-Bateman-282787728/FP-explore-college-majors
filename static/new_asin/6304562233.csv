Make The Connection, a 1997 VHS (talk about a blast from the past!) companion to her book released the prior year, covers her journey from a self-confessed food addict to a woman who took over the reins of her life and turned it all around.

After a few emotional testimonials from everyday women who've struggled with weight and self-esteem issues, Oprah takes us back to her childhood. Growing up as the only child on her grandmother's Mississippi farm, Oprah found solace in food. Her grandma would cook up all kinds of good eatin', chile: Big biscuits with lots of syrup, grits with cheese, cornbread, greens, and fried chicken and fried okrah. The little girl unconsciously equated food with feelings of comfort and reassurance. That unhealthy relationship with food followed her all the way from her stressful years as a 20 something newcaster in Baltimore to becoming the Queen of Daytime Tv in Chicago.

Peppered with clips from her talk show, private home movies, and interviews, Oprah speaks uninhibitedly about gaining so much success in her professional career, but being unable to enjoy it because her personal life was consumed by her weight and the criticism she received for it. Two humiliating experiences forced her to drop the weight. The first took place ringside at a Michael Tyson boxing match in 1987. The announcer introduced Tyson's weight at 230 pounds and to Winfrey's horror, it was her exact weight number too. The second occurred at a banquet. Oprah had gone over to a table to greet friends when her partner Stedman Graham overheard a group of women make nasty comments about her weight. ""Well, she may have everything, but she still has a fat @ss!""

Oprah immediately followed the Optifast diet, staying away from solid foods and only drinking liquid supplements for 4 months. She shed 67 pounds and showed off her slender figure in a pair of size 10 Calvin Klein jeans on a show titled Diet Dreams Come True in November 1988. She also wheeled out a wagon of animal fat signifying the weight she'd lost. In no time at all, the talk diva gained all of the weight back and then some.

It wasn't until a final humiliating moment in May of 1992 that Oprah got serious about losing weight the healthy way. She'd won ""Best Talk Show Host"" at the Daytime Emmy Awards and was too embarrassed over her physical appearance to bask in the moment of glory. Sick and tired of all the shame and self-loathing, Ms. Oprah made a call to trainer Bob Greene and with his help adopted a healthier lifestyle.

Bob's advice is practical and helpful. According to him, one should eat smaller meals with snacks in-between and don't eat 2 hours before bed. Also make sure you eat breakfast in the morning since it's the most important meal of the day. Most importantly, diets don't work. No more useless yo-yo dieting, people! However, his advice isn't always right on the money. Remember the classic ""8 glasses of water a day"" rule? We've since discovered it's a myth, but that's the only misstep.

If you're sick of struggling with your weight, pop this tape in and pick up a few helpful tips! You're not alone in your fight and all you need is some self-love and determination to reach your goal. Now Get With the Program!",1275350400,2,3341,4.731958762886598

7875056,5,6304562233,"I just watched this last night. I was a little worried about it for some reason but now I'm so glad I bought this. I'm sure I'll watch it many times and lend it to friends. You thought you knew Oprah? She really bares her  heart and soul here in the name of helping others come to the realizations  she's come to. Very inspiring. Beautifully shot and produced. Solid  information on exercise, but unfortunately touts a very low fat diet, which  latest research and many people's experience have proven is not healthy  over the long term. But if you get sound nutrition information from Beyond  Pritikin or The Diet Cure, you can follow the other recommendations in this  video and find inspiration in Oprah's struggles and triumph. It inspired me  to get up before 5 this morning to exercise! (Only because I have to be to  work by 8.) Do it!",935539200,16,842,4.52317880794702
