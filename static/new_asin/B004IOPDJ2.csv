4387277,5,B004IOPDJ2,"After a violent assault destroyed his memory, NY illustrator Mark Hogencamp had to try to rebuild his life. Living alone in the country, he created his own world, Marwencol, a WW2 Belgian town populated by Barbie and Ken type dolls. Through the storylines that he creates and photographs, Hogencamp works through some of the trauma he has suffered; from his alter-ego doll getting a pasting from the SAS (but getting his revenge later) to the loneliness of his life which he somewhat alleviates by having various female dolls in his stories represent specific unattainable women he meets in everyday life. Hogencamp's skilful photography and styling ultimately lead to an art exhibition in NY. This is a sad but fascinating documentary containing much footage of Marwencol with commentary by the artist",1320710400,,802,5.176923076923077
4387278,5,B004IOPDJ2,This wasn't an easy video to watch because the subject matter ... a brutal beating and loss of self ... was heart wrenching. Mark Hogancamp is an artist in the truest sense. He creates out of a deep need to make sense of his life and isn't swayed by commercial interests. The WWII town of Marwencol and its brave and brooding dolls cast a strange spell on me. Recommended this to all my artsy friends.,1313798400,6,401,4.36

4387280,4,B004IOPDJ2,"There is this movie Marwencol and there is the city of Marwencol made by Mark Hogancamp.  I'd give this movie 4 stars but Mark and his city 5 or more if I could.

Let's start with Mark and his city.  He was beaten so badly that well I'm surprised he's with us today.  Why?  Because he said the wrong thing in a bar about himself - or so the five men who beat him claim.  Mark has no real recollection of this as the beating stole his memories and therefore most of his life from him.

He's nursed back to life in the hospital - to a point.  Eventually he learns there is no more insurance and therefore no help for him and he's basically alone in the world with a body and brain that still need help.  So he does what many people do, uses art as therapy.  Unlike what many people do, he took it to an all new level, creating his own town: Marwencol.  Dolls, model kits, pieces of wood laying around - whatever he has and seems to fit into his storyline.  He takes pictures of his various scenes.  Oh and obviously along the way he gets discovered.

I'd give the movie the extra star except that it seems to struggle at times unsure of how to mix Mark's previous life, beating, and new life together.  Did it want to tell us about who he was before all of this?  About the beating at all?  I am glad they made Mark and not the criminals the focus - he did that for himself by creating Marwencol, usually the bad guys get the focus.  Still the movie didn't seem to know how to handle the incident.  Part of this odd do we mix in all of the pieces or not feeling could be attributed to Mark himself having lost his memory and slowly getting some of it back in pieces.  On the other hand they had resources beyond just Mark and were piecing it all together fine when they wanted to - so it left me a little confused.

Still I was inspired enough by it all that I ran off to the Marwencol web site and found that I could donate to the cause (as of the time of this review he's not selling his art but is accepting supplies).  Needless to say, the same day I saw the movie (yesterday) I sent a few pieces that will hopefully inspire Mark back the way he inspired me and maybe make their way into Marwencol someday.",1304985600,,2208,4.0979020979020975
4387281,5,B004IOPDJ2,"An incredibly powerful and haunting film.  My only criticism is that the climactic trip to New York feels artificial and tacked-on.  I considered marking it down a star due to the art show scenes, but the rest is so powerful that it easily earns five.

I hope Mark is happy and has been able to continue his life in Marwencol without too much disruption (Assuming that is what he wants, of course.).",1304467200,3,399,4.513888888888889
4387282,5,B004IOPDJ2,"I found the documentary to be fascinating and uplifting.  Uplifting because this gentle spirit manages to recover some dignity of life after his tragedy and creates this wonderful, evocative world-fantasy that he, at some level, lives in - that comforts him - but that he understands is not real.  Populated with his real-life friends and his archetypal enemies, his fantasies and his realities, it is, in the end, a more righteous place than the world we live in.
And he is such a complex and interesting man.  So private, but so honest and forthright when he talks about himself.
And then there is the story itself.  Of a man that experienced such hate and suffering and somehow came through it to create this strange, private world.
I loved the film. I think you might, also.",1303776000,14,778,4.7407407407407405
4387283,4,B004IOPDJ2,"I'm rating this film high not because of the actual production of it, but because of the overall fascination I felt for quite some time after viewing it. I kept mulling it over and marvelling.

The demonstration of Mr. Hogancamp's artistic obsession with his little village and the extent to which he went for authentication; the creativity and imagination he demonstrates; his finely detailed work on all the pieces along with the vast amount of time it must have taken on a daily basis not to mention the monetary expense he went to is mind-blowing.

The content of the film enables it to stand on its own without directorial or scriptual interpretations or embellishments for it is a film about a truly unique person and how many of those do we encounter in this world?",1303257600,6,772,4.711111111111111

The story was definitely intriguing enough to draw me in as I love documentaries, but it felt shallow and really drawn out.

So now I got it and watched it again and it's just as good as I remembered it. I recommend and let borrow this movie to anyone I know on the condition they don't watch any trailers for or read about it before. I understand that's hard to do now. And why would you watch something without knowing anything about it beforehand? I understand. But it is totally worth it for Marwencol. I sat down to watch it a few years ago without knowing a single thing about it, the story unraveling, every bit of information and frame brand new, and I'm so glad I did. I think it'd be really hard not to be affected by Marwencol. Beautiful pictures. Interesting story that really sinks into you.

4387289,5,B004IOPDJ2,"This documentary is so honest, and sincere. It never tries to sugar coat anything, but it doesn't force out unnecessary edginess or ""dramatic documentary manipulation"" .
Mark Hogancamp is a unique and wonderful human, who is up front about his old vices and things, and how his accident changed him. I think what happened to him was absolutely awful, the fact that he makes these beautiful stories out of it, is astounding.
This documentary filled many key points of a good documentary. The self healing Mark is doing is astounding. It's so hard to heal after something traumatic, especially a traumatic brain injury, but Mark seems to be doing better, in some ways he probably never expected.

4387292,5,B004IOPDJ2,"Marwencol is an outstanding documentary portrait of artist/photographer, Mark Hogancamp. Due to a severe brain injury caused by a near fatal hate crime in 2000, he suffers from memory loss, diminished motor skills, and post-traumatic stress disorder. On public assistance with little medical benefits, he engineers his own mental and physical therapy by building a 1/6th-scale village populated by action figures and fashion dolls. He names his village Marwencol and in it creates fictitious tableaux from WWII Belgium that mirror the violence he has suffered in his own life in present day Kingston, NY. The dolls are avatars of his friends and family, himself, and even his attackers.  Hogancamp also had a troubled prior life with alcoholism and identity issues. These also take form within the Marwencol storyline. This before and after are the stuff of his alternate life and ultimately his art.

However, it is not the crude scale models or comicbook-like storytelling that is his art, rather it is his painstaking photographs documenting his narratives that are truly remarkable. So much so, a gallery in New York City offers him a showing. Filmmaker Jeff Malmberg picks up Hogancamps story not long before this by interviewing the artist and several of his friends and family. Yet, it is Hogancamps own testimony of adjusting to his new existence and what Marwencol means to him that is the soul of the film. He speaks with humor, candor, anger, and often wears his heart on his sleeve.

This film won many awards when it was released in 2010, but due to a technicality, was not eligible for an Oscar.  And as a coda, Mark Hogancamp has had several more prominent gallery showings and despite fears expressed in the documentary, has fared well and continues to build and photograph his Marwencol world.",1435104000,,1810,5.043478260869565

4387299,4,B004IOPDJ2,"Marwencol (Jeff Malmberg, 2010)

In the main, I loved Marwencol. It's a riveting documentary that focuses on something very rare in today's ultra-politically-correct culture: here's a guy who suffered a massive head trauma--almost died, in fact--and the film isn't holding him up as a martyr because of it. The film is focusing on the fact that he took the changes in his brain chemistry that resulted from the head trauma and made a [censored for Amazon consumption] fine career out of them. He suffered horribly, he came out the other side stronger for it, and he has become a popular, influential underground artist. And at no point during the first half of this film did I think to ask myself: why did he suffer this head trauma? We are given a simple explanation, and away we go.

And here is where I think Jeff Malmberg fails, to some extent, in telling this story: all the sudden he blindsides us with another piece of Mark Hogancamp's character--the one that caused him to suffer said head trauma. (I'm trying to relate all this without being spoily, since it is painfully obvious that Malmberg wants this to be the major spoiler for this film--and isn't that part of the problem, the very idea of using the term ""spoiler"" when you're talking about a documentary?) We've spent so much time in this film talking--very successfully--about Marwencol and its maker, and then all the sudden bam, out of the blue, Malmberg turns a documentary into a combination of failed mystery film (failed because there is no foreshadowing at all) and social justice crusade. And I rush to add I am saying this as someone who is perfectly in agreement with the particular crusade that Malmberg (and, now that he has gained some influence in the world, Hogancamp as well) is on. I am totally down with the world needing to be accepting of (and I apologize for terming it this way, but again I am trying not to be spoily) the type of person Mark Hogancamp is. However, in the case of Marwencol, I think Malmberg did both Mark Hogancamp and the film a disservice by not being up front with this information. And it goes without saying it makes reviewing the movie a chore (which is why, in part, I'm writing this review in August of 2013, and my spreadsheet tells me I watched the movie on April 19, 2012. Oh, man, I'm farther behind than I thought--my spreadsheet has headers in chronological order, and Marwencol is eighth on the list. Guess I know what I'm doing this weekend...)

If you have somehow missed the buzz surrounding this movie, and maybe it's just the circles I move in but it seemed to me like Marwencol was getting just as much press as March of the Penguins or Winged Migration, Mawencol is the story, as I have mentioned, of Mark Hogancamp, a man who was assaulted outside a bar one night, suffered massive head trauma, and as a result was left jobless, broke, and basically unemployable. Obviously at a loose end, he conceived an alternate World War II Germany. Some people might have turned it into a novel. Hogancamp decided to work in miniatures, and transformed the back yard of his house into a 1:12-scale war zone. Eventually, he started taking pictures, and they started coming to people's attention. The rest--well, instead of me saying ""the rest is alternate history"", I'll just tell you to google Mark Hogancamp and peruse articles in Psychology Today, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and dozens of others, and check out exhibitions he's done at galleries (the opening of the exhibit at White Columns is covered in the final quarter of Marwencol).

I'm certainly not going to tell you not to see it--it is, despite its shortcomings, a fascinating psychological study and an approachable, affable documentary about one of contemporary art's more intriguing figures--but I think it could have been better than it is. Still, check this one out, sooner rather than later, but be prepared for some cognitive disjunct where none was necessary. *** ",1379289600,,3972,4.767441860465116

4387302,4,B004IOPDJ2,"There have been some number of documentaries that have dealt with people who were challenged in some form or other and not only overcame the challenge but did so in an astounding way. This is one of those documentaries.

Here's the scoop. Mark Hogancamp gets beat up outside a bar one night by five guys. He's beat up so bad he's in a coma for nine days. He's forgotten almost everything. He needs to relearn how to eat, walk and do most of the things we all take for granted. He develops his own therapy by creating a fictitious town (Marwencol) and peopling it with 1/6th scale figures he dresses in both military and civilian garb. He creates a story around them, poses them in various scenes and shoots photos of the scenes.

This is some pretty remarkable stuff. This guy was on the verge of being a vegetable and he makes a comeback like few have ever made. He paints and clothes the figures and gives their faces personalities. He names many of them after people he knows, including himself. As the figures are movable, he's able to pose them and pose them he does. Seeing the scenes he's set up is eerie. He has an uncanny knack for setting them up in a way that makes it look as though you're viewing real people. The ongoing story he narrates is a bit creepy in that it's centered in a bar featuring catfighting women, and involves WWII soldiers (some of which are German SS). Though he no longer drinks, the characters in the bar drink a lot. There is violence, torture and death in abundance.

The format of the documentary isn't particularly different, but they do let Mark's voiceover hover over the scenes he's created with his characters which takes up a lion's share of the time. This I loved. The scenes, and his photos of them, are what's happening here. He gets discovered accidentally and ends up getting a show in an art gallery in Greenwich Village. This is something I wish they'd followed up. You see Mark at his show but what size success was it? Did he sell stuff? Did he have other shows? Are people still buying his photos? I would love to have found this out. This is still a heck of a documentary. The final scene might creep you out but it's well worth the time to watch.",1328832000,,2203,4.434567901234568
4387303,5,B004IOPDJ2,"4.5 stars

Context is meaning and can often frame art to make it much deeper. Director Malmberg knows this well and makes some excellent choices in Marwencol; there are so many ways to approach this story, and he found a wonderfully subtle, empathic narrative. We're given bits and pieces of the backstory, but the main point here is the powerful life in Mark's art. When you first see it, it has a certain resonance that can't be defined. It ain't your average dollhouse, to be sure.

As we learn about Mark and his ordeal and what caused it, the town and characters of Marwencol take on a much stronger level of meaning. They show us Mark's soul, his pain, his resolve, his sadness, and if we look cloesly enough we might even get a glimpse of our own fractured inner lives. But most of us haven't manifested them on the physical plane, let alone this revealingly. That's what artists do, and by that definition Hogencamp is most certainly a fine artist.

There's a lt of sly humor here, and Malmberg's feel for his subject is the best thing about this film (outside of Mark's unique world, of course). The director knows that world and takes us into it cleanly. It's a strange yet oddly calming ride, and the affection of Mark's friends for him and his world says volumes.

The brief glimpses of his past and the refusal of Malmberg to dwell on the crime, instead focusing on the art that grows out of that crime's wound, are what makes this film so interesting. It takes its time, but the deeper you go the more it all means. I was especially moved by Mark's pre-attack sketch of him holding onto AA. It goes by fast; watch for it and pause there and take a long look. It hauntingly prefaces what followed.

We've all got issues, but not many of us are able to both express and simultaneously transcend them on this level. That Mark is so far removed from the Art World---and that his documentarist is so finely attuned to Mark's own world of art---is what makes Marwencol a wonderfully unique and satisfying film.",1323302400,2,2018,4.532967032967033

There is magic in essence.

This story shows that one is never too old, too lost, or too broken to find themselves and create a whole new life.
