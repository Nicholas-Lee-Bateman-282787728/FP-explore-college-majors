8693491,5,B00R0419R2,"This movie was quite entertaining and most certainly greatly better than I had percieved it would be. I had been thinking this might just be a short little movie to pass the time over on Netflix, and something simply for maybe a 3 or 4 year old, but cute. This movie definitely still has a said cuteness to it, even if the film itself isn't necessarily 'cute'... if you know how I mean this... However, this is most certainly enjoyable by adults, and really just anyone. I lovedthe story, and the animation style as well. This kind of gave me a neat feeling that you might not really get a chance to see or feel in many cartoons these days. Definitely a winner of a movie and worth owning rather than just watching! : )",1432598400,,719,4.333333333333333
8693492,4,B00R0419R2,"Cute movie, with a nice message. The movie also had some unique and well made cartoon artistry throughout too. I loved how the writers kept many of the secrets of the movie throughout and kept the viewer guessing. Too often in movies like this you know from the very beginning what the outcome is going to be, but not in this. Instead, the movie is well-paced and well written, and in the end you get a fun, family friendly movie, that even though it was not a huge blockbuster, it still was enjoyable and a good movie to watch together!
