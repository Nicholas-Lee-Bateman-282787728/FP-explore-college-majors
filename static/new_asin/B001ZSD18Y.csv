I took Jazz and various other dance classes for 15 years and some of the leaps and layouts are beyond my ability...just never been flexible enough. They go through the steps slower and then very fast. The video quality is pretty horrible, must have been converted directly from an old VHS...for that reason alone this DVD is grossly overpriced. The combinations are fun, very 1990 but I prefer that...no raunchy moves in this video! Good, solid floorwork and isolations that are still relevant and challenging. You need a lot of space to dance with this video effectively. I wish Christy would make an updated DVD!",1413072000,,679,4.862068965517241
