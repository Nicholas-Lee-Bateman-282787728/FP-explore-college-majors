515113,4,6302806348,"A manic, mile-a-minute screwball comedy starring Jean Arthur as a sassy, loveable every-gal who has to hide her ne'er-do-well boyfriend (Cary Grant) from the law after he escapes from jail to escape the death penalty (or lynching) for a crime he didn't commit.  Seems he's some kind of free-thinker (anarchist, really) who asked too many questions about his capitalist boss, and wound up framed for the murder of his foreman, and the burning of the factory he worked in.  As if THAT weren't complicated and far-fetched enough, add in Ronald Coleman, as a prospective Supreme Court judge who just HAPPENS to be the new tenant at Jean's villa, the week that Grant holes up in the attic.  The comedy hinges on Arthur's Lucy-like attempts to hide the fugitive without Coleman catching on; the movie itself is meant to hinge on the Capra-esque, leftie-populist plot.  Doesn't quite gel, but it is a weird and interesting time capsule, sort of a leftover from the 'Thirties, when socially-conscious films like this were more common (and less out of place; WWII really changed the face of Hollywood, and this seems like something that got left on the shelf a little too long.)  Not Arthur's best performance, but Grant has some choice moments sparring intellectually with Coleman's idealistic barrister.",1052438400,,1296,5.037383177570093
515114,2,6302806348,"Columbia Pictures has regressed in their shoddy film transfers of catalogue titles with this DVD.  The film, a great screwball adventure that pits a prison escapee (Cary Grant) against a stuffy law professor (Ronald Colman) is about as witty, charming and utterly engaging as one could hope for. Resident studio do-gooder, Jean Arthur is a treat as the woman whose love for the two men is brought to hilarious fruition.  As a film, it's five stars all the way! But the DVD is a thoroughly miserable experience with excessive film grain, fine detail shimmering, aliasing problems and varying degrees of stock footage used in the transfer. The hi-def packaging is also deceptive. * Note: the phrasing ""remastered in hi-def"" means nothing unless the source elements have first been cleaned up.  Let the buyer beware! Over all, a mediocre experience. Wait for Criterion to get their hands on it or Columbia to come to its senses and do a restoration.",1046304000,50,946,4.937106918238993
515115,4,6302806348,"You need to know a few things before buying the DVD of this very entertaining George Stevens comedy. One, it's not really a 'screwball' comedy, so if you're expecting outrageous hijinks like Bringing Up Baby, or The Awful Truth you might be a little disappointed. In tone it's very much in line with the films of Frank Capra or George Steven's own The More the Merrier, another great film starring the seriously under appreciated Jean Arthur. The second thing you should know, is that Columbia aka Sony has done very little to warrant the $... list price for the DVD. Picture quality is poor and they have the nerve to charge this much money for a pan and scan version of a 60 yr old film with no extras. It's really disgraceful and disrespectful of Sony to do this to film lovers... (though the list price is five dollars less than Talk of the Town, it's still too much for a great film that's desperately in need of restoration) So in short, a very entertaining film in a very cheesy presentation.",1046304000,19,999,4.524861878453039
515116,4,6302806348,"Sometimes I am tempted to describe this movie as having split personality disorder. On one level, it seems to be a lighthearted comedy with a love triangle between Cary Grant, Ronald Coleman, and Jean Arthur. And on another level, it aims to deal with deeper issues like the role of the law in society, etc, etc. But, actually, I think a more accurate way to describe this movie would be as a late screwball comedy. During the WWII years, screwball comedy, which had been so carefree in the depression, began to take on more serious issues, leading to movies like this one - strange mixes of the screwball spirit and deeper concerns.
Regardless of its strange synthesis of screwball and serious issues, however, The Talk of the Town is a classic, and a great movie! Essentially, it is about a small town rebel (Cary Grant, in an uncharacteristic role) who escapes from prision after being wrongly accused of arson and murder. He comes across a former friend (Jean Arthur) and stays with her, posing as the gardener when a law professor (Ronald Coleman) comes to rent her house. There are many hilarious situations in the house, but the movie also discussed the role of the law in society and whether law should be interpreted coldly and to the letter or have a more personal application.
The acting is very good. Cary Grant, though in a strange role, proves his talent as a more dramatic actor (and also shows off his incredible comedic skills). Even though he was ignored by the Oscars for years, Grant really was a spectacular actor - he just wasn't given enough credit because he tended to make it all look so easy.  Ronald Coleman is also good as his urbane, cold rival, and Jean Arthur is great - her reactions steal scene after scene!
Anyhow, this movie is very good. Although it is somewhat of a strange mix, it is quite enjoyable and typical of the semi-screwball comedies from the war years. Get this and enjoy!",1027036800,34,1920,4.647058823529412
515117,5,6302806348,"THE TALK OF THE TOWN manages with equal ease to deal with love and law.  As the principal object of love, Jean Arthur unexpectedly finds herself hiding an escaped arsonist in her attic.  As the principal object of the law, Cary Grant plays the alleged arsonist.  On neutral ground, at the start, stands Ronald Colman as a distinguished dean of a law school.  But before the film is over, the dean loses his detatched academic attitude towards both love and law, and even gets involved with a blonde manicurist.  Grant meets his comeuppance throught his peculiar taste for a Polish soup made with eggs and beets.  Jean Arthur had the unique distinction of playing her final love scenes in the U.S. Supreme Court Building!  Bright and literate, this Columbia comedy from 1942 has its head in the clouds & its feet on the ground.  According to a 1942 report done in VARIETY, Grade ""A"" movies were beating box-office records since 1927.  This was partly due to the fact that better movies were now being made and a natural wartime desire for escapist entertainment (in the thirties, the reason being the Great Depression, naturally).  Most of Hollywood's extra profits, however, were going up the river in extra war taxes.",1005436800,6,1218,4.8125
515118,5,6302806348,"In the classic screwball comedy ""Talk of the Town,"" Ronald Colman plays Michael Lightcap, a dry, by-the-book law professor who rents the house of school Nora Shelley, played by Jean Arthur, who happens to be harboring a fugitive from justice, Leopold Dilg, played by Cary Grant.  Nora passes off Leopold as her gardener, which confuses Professor Lightcap.  Judicial corruption and the wacky ways of American justice are satirized, which is a bit depressing when you realize it is 1942 and already things are pretty sad.  As Leopold says at one point: ""What is the law? It's a gun pointed at somebody's head. All depends upon which end of the gun you stand, whether the law is just or not.""  Certainly the idea that the less privileged deserve a fair deal is more popular today than it was then, but you would not say this film is really dated in that regard.  All three principles turn in great comic performances.  Glenda Farrell plays a woman who helps the professor find the real arsonist, and Edgar Buchanan, Charles Dingle and Emma Dunn all have choice supporting roles to play in the proceedings.  The crackling dialogue in the script by Dale Van Every, Irwin Shaw and Sidney Buchman from Sidney Harmon's story is excellent but director George Stevens gets the highest marks, mainly because you do not think of him as doing this type of comedy.",999388800,9,1350,4.76824034334764

515120,5,6302806348,"This is a witty comedy,full of some wonderful bon mots that dot the clever dialog, and essayed with zest by Grant, Arthur and Colman. Grant takes refuge in Arthur's house along with professor Colman. Cary was framed for  arson by a corrupt local government, and what's more, the foreman (who  supposedly died in the blaze) is very much alive (in the form of Colman!)  George Stevens directs his cast well, handling the double-edged story with  grace and style. This film was a hit with the public in 1942, and it gave  Colman's career a much needed boost.",944524800,9,555,4.680412371134021

515334,4,6302806348,"There are a million ways that Hollywood has played the story of those falsely accused of heinous crimes (heinous a word in bad odor these days according to some of my younger associates but nevertheless useful here) from the serious social dramas Warner Brothers put out usually with guys like Paul Henried or Paul Lucak playing the sober somber lead to the film under review, Cary Grant and Jean Arthurs The Talk Of The Town where it is played with a bit of off-hand humor.

Now if you thought that the title meant we were, following The New Yorker section of the same name, talking about New York City and its doing you would be wrong. We are dealing here strictly with a Podunk town of unknown original where the mills are run, as in usually the case in one mill town, by one guy or family and they have an overweening influence (overweening another word in bad odor but give me a better one and I will substitute gladly) on the life of such towns. In other words they run things from top to bottom where it counts from the mayor, police chief, and justice system all the way down to the average citizen who just happens to be depend on that mill paycheck to keep body and soul together, usually with a family attached.

That premise is what guides this off-beat look at the rule of law in American life in a more innocent, trusting age. See Leopold (played by Cary Grant a very non-Leopold looking guy) a mill worker and political agitator of unknown ideological and organizational views although presumed to be left-wing given the forces at play got set up, got set up big time to take the big step off for committing arson at Mister Mill-owners mills (fill in the blank in our town it was the MacAdams Mills before they closed and headed south and thereafter to foreign lands) and incidentally killing a mill foreman. Thus Leopold was headed for a felony murder count and hang him high. But Leopold was innocent, innocent as a babe, well, maybe not quite that innocent but of the murder rap for sure. Rather than see himself swing from some dawn gallows he did what every innocent man would do-he escaped from the pokey, set out to prove one way or the other that he had been framed, framed with a ribbon on it.

Here is where things get dicey, and sets what is essentially another 1940s wartime romantic comedy to keep the wives and girlfriends who populated the theaters then waiting for the other shoe to drop in the muds of Europe or the corals of the Pacific from fretting to death apart from a more sober look at the justice system in small town America in those days. What ensues is a comedy of error involving Nora (played by Jean Arthur), whom Leopold has had a crush on since high school, and a law professor, lets call him Mike although his persona is not very Mike-like but rather Sir Michael-like, (played by Ronald Coleman) when Leopold, on the lam, winds up at a house that Nora is setting up to rent to Mike. Naturally a law professor cant ignore having an escaped accused felon around and so through dodges and whatnots Leopold finally see the professors rational, legal light. Sees that he has to turn himself in to get a crack at some justice.

Of course along the way there is a dramatic built-up of romantic interest in Nora by both Leopold, who wears his intentions on his sleeves, and the more reserved but equally ardent Mike. Of course as well no way was Mike (or the scriptwriters in a romantic comedy) going let Leopold go to the gallows after he decided to follow the professors advice and let justice work its blinded eyes so Mike began to investigate things. Found out through his snooping that the allegedly dead foreman was hiding out in Boston and that the mill-owner had been for his own maniacal reasons the cause of the arson. Justice prevailed. As for the real core of the story line though-who got Nora-well naturally it had to be Leopold since in those days Cary Grand played no second-fiddle to any other guy with the ladies. Mike well he got the boobie prize-an Associate Justice-ship on the United States Supreme Court. See what I mean when I say that it was a more innocent age.",1451520000,,4127,4.498666666666667

515523,5,6302806348,"THE TALK OF THE TOWN doesn't start slowly. We are in the heat of the dramatic action. The woolen mills are burning downm. Newspapers show that the the fire is of suspcious origin and that the foreman has died. Enter a tough and mean-looking Leopold, played by Cary Grant, as the alleged culprit and our story begins. We are led to believe that this is a going to be a serious crime drama but nothing could be further from the truth.

Leopold escapes from prison and a sure conviction and ends up in the home of Norma, the lovely Jean Arthur. She happens to be tidying up the house for her new renter, a famous law professor. Ronald Colman as the professor shows up early and now Norma has two unexpected houseguests.

Both Grant and Arthur show their strong comedic talents as Norma tries to keep Leopold out of site of the professor. Not one to stay in hiding, Leopold makes himself known and is quickly introduced as ""Joseph the gardner."" Norma has two men on her hands who are on opposite ends of the law. ""Joseph"" and the professor soon develop an friendship and emotional bond that is strengthened by their mutual love of Norma.

The humor really hits a high point as Norma has to keep the professor from seeing the cover of the morning newspaper that is splashed with a picture of the wanted criminal Joseph or rather, Leopold. It's one of the funniest movie scenes I have ever seen. Arthur is truly hilarious.

It's always fun to recognize some faces in the cast who I know from later roles. Lloyld Bridges has a small role as a young newspaper reporter. Edgar Buchanan, Uncle Joe from the TV series PETTICOAT JUNCTION, is Leopold's court appointed lawyer. We know that justice is not fair in this small town and there is no hard evidence Leopold committed the crime. Soon the professor is on the case.

Cary Grant is definitely one of the most dashing and good looking actors of all time. Despite his physical beauty, he plays his character as a normal guy and really enjoy the comedy of his role. He truly was one of a kind and there will ne no other like him.
Jean Arthur is another delight and they are complemented by the proper and seriously Ronald Colman whose character is honest and kind.

She also looked pretty bad, considering how well she looked in ""The More the Merrier"", a much, much better film made the next year. (They put her on a diet - incredibly, Jean was very chubby in this.  Her hair was dark and false looking and she looked harsh and wrinkled with fake eyelashes and a wiglet to boot.)

Ronald Colman played Ronald Colman, but he was stuck in a role that ranged from that of an unbending, pontificating man of justice to that of a silly, love-besotted fool.  - Really, the only enjoyable performance was from Cary Grant, who was badly miscast, as I said, but wonderfully handsome and adept in an awkward role. - Very overrated film.

When the mill burns down and a man is killed in the inferno Dilg is accused by the owner of setting the fire. The mill owner has friends in high places and the fix is in. In spite of the fact that he is innocent Leopold Dilg is all but certain to be convicted of arson and murder. He will be made an example of and there is little doubt that he will be executed.

But Dilg manages to escape from custody and badly injures his leg in the process. He turns up at a house owned by an old flame Miss Nora Shelley (Jean Arthur).  At first she is frightened by the encounter but Miss Shelley quickly becomes sympathetic to his plight and scrambles to help him in any way she can. Matters are greatly complicated because Miss Shelley has rented this house to a law professor named Michael Lightcap (Ronald Colman). When Lightcap shows up all hell breaks loose and the results are positively hilarious. One thing leads to another and Miss Shelley introduces Dilg to the professor as """"the gardener"".  The two immediately hit it off and before long are engaging in deep philosophical discussions.  How long can Leopold Dilg keep up his charade?  Meanwhile, both Dilg and Lightcap are vying for the affections of MIss Shelley while the police are closing in on the suspect.

- the script is a mixture of comedy, romance and message in the genre of many of Frank Capra's films
- Cary Grant plays a darker character than he had to this point and it is a preview of future roles, particularly with Alfred  Hitchcock. He is very good but Ronald Colman plays a staid lawyer and maybe his acting is boring because he is in character!
- Jean Arthur's charm carries the film. She develops a relationship with both the leading men, light and spunky with Grant and serious and spinsterish with Colman. One of the film's merits is that we are never really sure with whom she may end up
- the print is very good
- a featurette is included which interviews the son of the director, George Stevens.

  Frederic Hollander wrote the musical score and he summed things up beautifully with the opening credits.  There were dead serious moments, then a romantic theme and thus followed the film.  The serious parts were filmed in shadow and low-key lighting anticipating no idea at all what was to follow.
  ""Talk of the Town"" plays to a large part with ambiguity.  Who loves whom, what is to be had, who is right - in total, what in the world is going on.  It injects humor, light but important, suspense throughout and one of the most satisfactory endings I can remember.  Stevens cut his teeth on short films with Laurel and Hardy and his expertise can be found everywhere but without slapstick in this case.  His secret is timing as it so often is and the timing from set to set or even within the entire film is impeccable.
  This a film to catch if you can.  I'm sorry I'd put it off for so many years!

it's very disparaging to realize that films such as this aren't produced anymore. nothing by modern standards is even remotely comparable to this rare classic. the subleminal moral tones that are integrated throughout are stimulating in an era in which profanity, graphic violence and explicit sexual innuendo have become such a common integral part of today's films.

i am 41 years old and i have been endeared to the classics since i was 18. i am proud of this nation's golden era of filmmaking in which integrity, honesty and morality were the foundational elements in films such as this.

515588,5,6302806348,"There are four huge names billed on this film: Cary Grant, Ronald Coleman, Jean Arthur and George Stevens. Classic stars, classic film, with a great if unconventional screwball script.

The fact of the matter is, the vehicle is Jean Arthur's place and time to shine. She's one of the essential heroines of the Screwball genre and look no further than this film to see what makes her one of THE best. Arthur carries the duty of playing the adorable Nora Shelley, torn between the affections of two opposing, if adoring, politically wanted characters and while the part doesn't call for much more than that, brings depth and sincerity to her part as no one else could. Arthur's specialty, ""her foghorn"" of a voice, is especially charming be it her scolding herself for forgetting that it was ""NO EGG DAY"" for Ronald Coleman (if you haven't seen the scene yet, it's hilarious!) or her wry acidic comments on the absurd situation the three of them are in.

The plot, a tad bit long, is a mix of a Frank Capra-ish commentary on American politics/small town corruption, and the satirical bedroom farce touch of Leo McCarey. All in all, the film is thoroughly enjoyable and rewarding to watch.

Cary, skilled of course at playing all possible double entendres, brings another dimension to his acting in his role as the escaped convict. those not used to seeing a slightly darker image of Grant than the ones he portrays in his films of the 50s are in for a treat!

Ronald Coleman is admirable as the future justice of peace to be and it's easy to see why he was of such demand by the ladies. Quite the gentleman (though truthfully, would anyone prefer him over Cary Grant? Not sure in my humble opinion!)

It's most certainly worth the Amazon Price, but my say is take the whole Cary Grant Box set! As for the restoration, it's better than the free public domain quality, if not pristine clear. my only qualms is for the bare ""special features"" on the DVD.

Cary Grant is in his best, Ronald Colman does his role fine, and Jean Arthur does her best. The first 3 minutes so many things happen, and so fast, that one expects to have a sure great time. But once the story gets going the scenes run repetitive and slower. The lines grow longer and become empty talk. A screwball comedy is not an easy thing to do, but you only have to compare this one to Hawks' ""Bringing Up Baby"" and ""Ball of Fire"" to see how far from the target Stevens was hitting. Frank Capra's too, are much better than this one.

2 hours is way too long for this film. The theme of idealism vs practicality, theoretical knowledge vs first-hand experience, and taking the justice into one's own hands vs trusting a dubious justice system, however high-minded, just don't win our complete attention. Colman's role is too stiff and apathetic, and it doesn't play well against Grants's excess of extroversion. Jean Arthur does all she can to make the thing funny but there's just not enough juice in this orange. It feels like she overacts sometimes.

  It's a fruitless game trying to piece out a director's intentions, but George Stevens seemed to be striving for comedy with substance here.  The opening scenes are very well done - Grant in a prison cell, Grant manhandling a guard through the bars of his cell and escaping into a stormy night.  Tight close-ups on Grant's dark and evil eyes.

  It's a great set up for a turgid crime melodrama.  But the weather clears, Jean Arthur hides him and Coleman arrives.  The gag is that Coleman doesn't know who he is, and Grant needs the jurist's help to clear his name.

 THE TALK OF THE TOWN never really finds its comedy footings after that first scene.  It works hard to do so, but the moody understory - the threat of mob violence if Grant is returned to jail - doesn't help much to lighten the mood. Nor does Edgar Buchanan, here Grant's lawyer convinced of his innocence, contribute what he's capable of.  Most screwball comedies benefit from their colorful secondary characters, but Buchanan, a capable comedic actor, is wasted here.  Director Stevens seems more interested in the blossoming friendship between Grant and Coleman as they prattle on and on in argument over Ideal and Practical Justice.

  Stars can carry a story, and on that basis I recommend TALK OF THE TOWN.  Certainly not as a screwball comedy, or really much of a comedy at all.",1102809600,16,1796,4.6528662420382165

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, at least the first hour and fifty-seven minutes of it. The last minute was the most tragic thing I've seen since A Tale of Two Cities. Why, why, why did Nora go off with a loser like Dilg? Obviously, he was not a man to settle down and behave himself. He didn't even have a vision or dream that made his strangeness admirable. I thought he looked very dark and sinister most of the time and there was absolutely nothing about him that made me want her to end up with him.
Ronald, on the other hand, was everything she needed, and if she was smart, she would have snapped him up. I certainly would have. He was intelligent, stable, and madly in love with her.
Anyway, you get the idea of my feelings about the two main fellers - Nora Shelley was cute, if a little silly at times (and very idiotic in the last couple minutes of the film).
As for the film itself: It was full of great moments. The egg-falling-on-the-newspaper scene was hilarious. The borscht with egg in it was also amusing. It was over all good story, filmed well, told well. I also enjoyed the part when Lightcap was trying to get information out of Miss Bush. He was so artless about it, as well he might be - he probably never went out with a woman before in his life. Which is why he was an awfully stiff dancer, too.
So anyway, I'm sure by now you've figured the little detail that cost my rating of this film one star - JEAN WENT OFF WITH THE WRONG MAN IN THE END!!
I expect this probably isn't the best review ever and that I'll receive lots of flak from Cary Grant fans, and that is O-K. I still like Ronnie better.",1082678400,6,1677,4.211180124223603

7831668,5,6302806348,This movie I never tire of. Jean Arthur is one of my favorite actresses and for me this was her best movie. Others might prefer The More the Merrier or Mr Deeds goes to Town or The Devil and Miss Jones but to me this is the one. With costars Cary Grant and Ronald Coleman the talent and star power on screen is as good as one will ever find.
