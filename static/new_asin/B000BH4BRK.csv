Just a honest look into a world very few ever get the chance to witness or experience. fun for all divers. shots are clear despite being underwater 99% of the time. great list of first class, first rate divers. all very respectful of mother nature and sea life (as much as a hunter can). great watch. highly recommend!",1283472000,,447,4.463414634146342
8597562,4,B000BH4BRK,"This video is action packed and very entertaining, shows great fishing sites around the US but specially in Florida.  However I give it a four star rating cuz I think it lacks information to the viewer about freediving and spearfishing itself.  By the way it is  a bit costly online compare to local stores such as Divers Direct,  I wound also recommend getting the DVD The Art Of Spearfshing,  Good Luck and enjoy!",1282435200,,415,4.63013698630137
