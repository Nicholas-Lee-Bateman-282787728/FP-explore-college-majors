3902663,3,B002C1EFZ6,"Uncharismatic Edmund Lowe gets top billing, but Bela Lugosi steals the show as the flamboyantly evil Roxor in Fox's big-screen adaptation of the popular radio serial. Director William Cameron Menzies and cinematographer James Wong Howe give ""Chandu the Magician"" (1932) a visual grandeur that compensates for a flawed script with obtrusive comic relief. Bela's mesmerizing villainy is a wonder to behold. The DVD includes an excellent commentary track by film historian Gregory Mank and a 15-minute ""Chandu"" featurette.",1373068800,2,519,5.666666666666667
3902664,4,B002C1EFZ6,"Chandu the Magician was a very popular radio program that had various incarnations since the creation of the character in 1931. This film gives Edmund Lowe the title part of a yogi whose mystical talents make him the ideal candidate to battle Roxor (Bela Lugosi), a power hungry madman who wants nothing more than Chandu's brother's death-ray invention so he can wipe out whole cities and make people cower.

The story takes us from the wilds of India to the comforts of a wealthy American home to the Egyptian lair of Roxor. The sets and visuals are spectacular and make this 1932 film seem much more mature and sophisticated than the average film from that year. William Cameron Menzies is a true credit to Chandu the Magician and without his expertise, this likely wouldn't have been as successful a venture. There are laughable moments, such as the end when characters are obviously running through corridors that are projected on a screen in front of them, but the overall fun of this picture makes us overlook its flaws. It delivers thrills and excitement from beginning to end, and it is a wonder the studio didn't make more films in this series with the same cast.",1372550400,,1172,4.745098039215686
3902665,4,B002C1EFZ6,"This is what Indiana Jones movies were like in the 30s. With Indian mystics, princesses, ray guns and such, there are more plot elements here than its 70 minutes can cover. However it is entertaining, and was made at a time when Lugosi was still in the ascendant. Indeed, his performance may be considered hammy by today's standards, but he's infinitely more fun than Edmund Lowe as the unconvincing Chandu. Some of the visual effects are quite stunning for 1932.",1360454400,3,463,4.8
3902666,5,B002C1EFZ6,"One of the best thriller films ever. I really don't agree that the lead, Chandu, is rather undynamic. After all, he was trained by yogis and has more to do with using his eyes, voice, and presence in overcoming evil than in appearing like Clark Gable. Lugosi is extremely dynamic, stagey, sometimes over the top, but always commanding of respect as the evil Roxor who is out to destroy the world. The reference to the Death Ray harks back to Tesla and his scientific genius, allegedly having worked out the mechanical plans for a death ray gun. Apparently when this film hit the theaters, the kids were more in love with it than the adults, but to me both kids and adults will find entertainment value here. The music backdrop, with its quasi-sounding Egyptian music and the lush, romantic lovers' theme, round out a great story, marvelously detailed sets and excellent lighting. You are in for a treat!",1348531200,4,903,4.7215189873417724
3902667,3,B002C1EFZ6,"Lowe is dull as the hero Chandu, which makes one root all the more for Lugosi's campy Roxor. Really great miniature & effects work by co-director William Cameron Menzies; the camera prowls down corridor after corridor till it finds an imprisoned scientist. It's obvious that George Lucas saw this a lot as a kid when he was crafting RAIDERS...",1313712000,,343,4.830508474576271
3902668,3,B002C1EFZ6,"Bela Lugosi (1882-1956) is forever remembered for his role as ""Dracula"" (1931), a persona he first adopted for the 1927 Broadway play. He was so successful in this genre that he subsequently appeared in dozens of ""horror"" films like ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" (1932), ""White Zombie"" (1932), ""The Black Cat"" (1934), ""The Raven"" (1935), ""The Invisible Ray"" (1936), etc. He often reprised the Dracula role - ""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935), ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948) - and even played Frankenstein (""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"") and Dr. Frankenstein's assistant Ygor (""Son of Frankenstein"", ""The Ghost of Frankenstein""). Unlike his fellow actor, Boris Karloff, Lugosi was never able to make it out of the B horror films, despite a few notable attempts (e.g., ""Ninotchka"").

""Chandu The Magician"" is one of the dozen films that came out following ""Dracula"". Lugosi got third billing, behind Edmund Lowe and Irene Ware (1910-93), and plays a megalomaniac intent on taking over the world by kidnapping the inventor of a death ray and forcing him to reveal its secrets. The film was based on a popular radio show.

Death rays were a popular subject in the 1920s with several people (including electricity pioneer Nikola Tesla) claiming to have invented the new technology. The concept originated with H.G. Welles in his classic novel ""War of the Worlds"" (1898), although it may be dated back to the legend of Archimedes using the sun to destroy a fleet of invading ships. The ""Tunguska event"" in Siberia in 1908 also prompted speculation about a ""death ray."" In 1929 ""Buck Rogers"" appeared as a comic strip (the first sci fi strip) and grew into a radio program in 1932. Buck uses ""disintegrator beams""

In our film Edmund Lowe (1890-1971) plays Chandu the Magician, turban and all, who is the brother in law of the kidnapped scientist. Lowe made 100+ films between 1915 and 1960, and was most popular in the silent era with films like ""What Price Glory"" (1926) and ""In Old Arizona"" (1928).

FWIW - In a 12 part serial ""The Return of Chandu"" (1934) Lowe was replaced by Lugosi.

Pretty Irene Ware (1910-93) won the Miss USA contest in 1929 and went on to appear in 29 films between 1932 and 1940. She plays an Egyptian Princess inserted as a love interest for Chandu, but with no real plot purpose.

FWIW - This film is one of the few pre1960 films in which people from different races were allowed to have a romance without paying the ultimate price. In ""Madame Butterfly"" (1932) Asian Sylvia Sydney commits hari kari when Cary Grant marries a white woman. In Frank Capra's ""The Bitter Tea of General Yen"" (1932) Barbara Stanwyck's suitor, an Asian warlord (Nils Asther) drinks poisoned tea. Even as late as 1957 (""Sayonara""), Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki commit suicide because they cannot be together.

William Cameron Menzies (1896-1957) directed this film, but is better known for his art direction for which he won 2 Oscars - ""The Dove"" (1927), ""Tempest"" (1928) and was nominated for 3 more. In 1940 he received a special Oscar for his color work on ""GWTW"" (1939). This was his third of 20 films he directed, the most notable of which were ""The Thief of Bagdad"" (1940) and ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946).
Cinematographer James Wong Howe (1899-1976) received 10 Oscar nominations and 2 wins (""Hud"" and ""The Rose Tattoo""). He started in the silent era and made 130+ films between 1923 and 1975.

1932 was a good year for films - Grand Hotel"" was the Oscar and box office king, Jean Harlow had 2 films in the top 10 (""Red Headed Woman"" and ""Red Dust"") as did Miriam Hopkins (""Trouble in Paradise"" and ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"") and Wallace Beery (""Champ"" and ""Grand Hotel""). Other notable films from that year were ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Freaks"", ""A Farewell to Arms"", ""Scarface"", ""Horse Feathers"" and ""Tarzan The Ape Man"".

The NY Times said ""This is hocus-pocus week at the Roxy, where most of the photographic tricks known to Hollywood have been assembled to startle and confound the enemies of Chandu."" They called it ""whooping entertainment for the children and a series of navely juvenile escapades for the grown-ups.""

Yes, this is a 1932 film and it is only a few years outside the silent film era. The acting is terrible and the story is pretty dumb, but the special effects are terrific and some of the camera work is far ahead of its time.",1311292800,6,4379,4.772787318361955
8362825,4,B002C1EFZ6,"About the movie : everyone must see this movie that ""inspired"" directly 1981 Raiders Of The Lost Ark, and to compare it to 2016 Doctor Strange.
This said, Chandu is a gem that the imaginative viewer will restore in his mind to projet astrally himself or herself in the golden age of pulp adventure.

As usual, Kino hasn't done a complete restoration, far from it : so many scratches that could have been doctored out of the image without any distorsion or degradation - contrast, details and clarity are decent but not so good. In no way this is the pristine presentation you may dream of after viewing some beautiful well-preserved and carefully restored 1930 movie.

Nethertheless I'm very happy to have that chance to see Chandu in this fair presentation.",1504569600,,758,4.778625954198473
8362826,5,B002C1EFZ6,"Been a Bela Lugosi fan for oh so long and never dreamed we would see this 1932 squeaky on HD Blu-Ray looking amazing for the year.
Bela's old B&W movies are of course fabulous this and Devil Bat to name but two.

The Chandu film is a joy to watch and with the quality being so high we do really get to see more detail of Bela than ever before if you get me. Really nice to have this and I hope more classic Bela films will follow.

Great work here 10/10",1492646400,2,453,3.9130434782608696
8362827,5,B002C1EFZ6,"Just finished watching ""Chandu The Magician"" released by 20th Century Fox.
Mom and Dad were great fans of ""Chandu The Magician"" when his adventures were first chronicled in the Golden Age of Radio; and I believe that they also had seen this movie at some point in their respective childhoods.  Mom did have a habit into sneaking into scary movies when Grandmother and Grandfather warned her not to.
""Chandu The Magician"" is a faithful adaptation of all those wonderful radio adventures.
 American-born Frank Chandler, who had learned occult secrets from a yogi in India became known as Chandu and possessed several supernatural skills, including astral projection, teleportation and the ability to create illusions.
When his teacher alerts him to the danger his sister's family is in
because his brother-in-law has created a death ray that the evil villian Roxor covets.  He kidnaps Regent and his death ray, causing Chandu to teleport to Cario, where his sister Dorothy and her children have been staying.  To his credit, Regent refuses to reveal the secret  of his  death ray, causing Chandu to act to save his sister and his niece and nephew.
What makes this movie different from the radio series is that this time Egyptian Princess Nadji agrees to marry Chandu once Roxor has been vanquished - in a rather interesting way by Chandu.
Great Fun!
Strongly Recommended!

8362828,5,B002C1EFZ6,"Fans of Bela Lugosi and early thirties movies will enjoy this entry into the mysticism genre. Although Edmund Lowe is Chandu, Bela steals the show as the villain of the piece. I was surprised at how well this film played with an upgraded blu player and a 60"" TV screen. Outdoor scenes and well lit scenes in the movie seemed very clear, almost like watching the original from 84 years ago. Indoor scenes and darker scenes were good enough and not distracting. A critic of the time called the film 'hokum' and that it certainly is, but entertaining all the same. Another draw is the commentary, a great job done by someone (for once) who actually tells you about the actors, who they were and how their careers turned out, the cinematographer (James Wong Howe) in an early effort, the directors, the art director, and why the studio wanted to make it in the first place, plus he is very funny in spots. There is also a featurette on Chandu, the character, how he was created and how he influenced future magician oriented films up to the present day. Ray Bradbury said that this film inspired him to write. And you can see the beginnings of Indiana Jones and other explorer/adventurer movies. Later Bela Lugosi  made the 12 part serial, The Return of Chandu, where he gets the part of Chandu, the mystical yogi. I ordered it today and can't wait.",1472256000,5,1345,4.580912863070539

8362830,5,B002C1EFZ6,"The five stars are for the combination of the film and the Extras which includes an excellent and informed Commentary by Greg Mank.
I have this motion picture on Fox Horror Classics Volume 2 DVD, and Fox did a great deal of work to restore this film (as you will see from the included Restoration Comparison). I'm buying ""Chandu the Magician"" again as I want to see and own it in high definition Blu-ray.

This film is often mistaken for the low-budget independent serial titled ""The Return of Chandu"" (which was later cut into 2 feature films) with Lugosi as the title character: Even Leonard Maltin's review books have made this error for decades (and erroneously gives this film a poor review).

This film is a big budget feature with high production values, and Bela Lugosi stars as the villain Roxor and not as Chandu. It's filled with what was then state-of-the-art special effects -- The biggest weakness is that Edmund Lowe as Chandu has no where near the charisma of Bela Lugosi as the bad guy.",1468800000,18,1003,4.661016949152542

The film itself  is beautifully art directed by William Cameron Menzies and features a wonderful performance by Lugosi as the villain, NOT the lead character ""Chandu.""
However,  Lugosi did play the character in later serials that featured  ""Chandu the Magician.""
