8040617,5,B00069FKQY,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

After defeating Sensui and closing the tunnel life is almost back to normal. Yusuke returns to demon world to meet his ancestor, Raizen. We also learn about the 3 rulers of demon world, and their connections to 3 of our 4 heroes.

This is a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1456,4.21505376344086

8040619,3,B00069FKQY,"The show was ok. We learnded alot on Hei but not much on Yuskae I would like to see more ablities on him he is the best charater. Though I am glad we will not see Kuabarra anymore he should be dropped out of the story all together. Kurma will be cool to see his past. I hope Hei and Yuskae and Kurma will be good friends later. I hope, am looking forward to next tape comes out. Feb. 22,2005",1107388800,,391,3.9
8040620,5,B00069FKQY,"Hiei at his best(I think) First episode thingy was super boring... all about Yusuke kinda. Second eposide is all Hiei(right? Haven't seen this in forever O_O)Between the 2nd and third episode they show the same scene at least 6 times, but a little more each time. Then in the third eposide it is a majorly long slow scene because for about 10 min they go none stop into Hiei's sad yet kind of funny past. (loved his baby face when he was told he could murder a certain person ^^) This is an awesome dvd that made me laugh and laugh hehe. (Next dvd i hope is somehow better, but nothing could possible beat this one) Great DvD, but the end is very freaky... i wish i knew that mukoru was going to do somethin weird i would have skipped it... scary...0_0...",1106784000,2,755,4.323943661971831
8040621,5,B00069FKQY,"This is for all you people who were annoyed, curious, and mad when Cartoon Network took it off the TV in the MIDDLE OF THE SERIES!!! Now it's back on, but I wanted to know what happened, so I did research...so I have no need for Cartoon Network. N E way, this really shows Hiei's past and why he couldn't tell Yukina he was her brother. It's nice to know that underneath, Hiei really has a loving heart. Hard to beleive, isn't it?",1106611200,2,430,4.192771084337349

  Control of Demon World is divided among three rulers: Raizen, Yomi and Mukuro. From his deathbed, Raizen has invited his descendant, Yusuke Urameshi, to return to Demon World to train under him for one climactic battle. Yusuke's first challenge is to defeat his ancestor. If he cannot defeat one of the three kings, how could he expect to stand up to the other two?!

  2 Haunted by The Past

  After years of searching, Hiei finally returns to his homeland. Hiei clearly remembers the traumatic banishing he was forced to endure. But despite his many losses, one thing was never far from his mind...complete and utter revenge! But to complete his mission Hiei must first survive an encounter with yet another demon from his past.

  3 The Secret of the Jagan

  Amidst haunting memories of Hiei's dark origins, a face from his past has unexpectedly returned. Now that Hiei has become strong enough to easily slay A-Class Demons, Mukuro called forth a tougher foe: the demon who implanted Hiei's Jagan Eye! Can Hiei survive? Does he even want to?",1102204800,7,1073,4.786885245901639
