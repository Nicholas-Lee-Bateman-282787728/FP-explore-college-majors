A little bit of cleaner took care of that and I figured that would solve my problems. However, I was filled with despair upon seeing the first few minutes of the episode. There are several misspellings and the subtitles make no sense what so ever. The only way one could understand a word of what is going on is if they had seen it online.",1276732800,,510,4.322916666666667
8326193,5,B0018CPQYY,"This is a great tv series that delves into the development of teens growing to adulthood and there difficulties, especially when they are orphans and the difficulties are even greater when you are a vampire.  This series follows four natural born vampires living together trying to create what they have missed, family.
Coupled with a employer who has problems and issues of his own, and a bossy, strange girl friend (Ami) who shows up periodically just to keep things interesting.
These vampires fight crime, spy, retrieve sensetive documents, along with trying to keep their little family unit together.
This drama, coupled with a little comedy and some heart wrenching stories comes probably the greatest Japanese series ever concieved, RH plus is a must see!",1258416000,,762,5.145161290322581
