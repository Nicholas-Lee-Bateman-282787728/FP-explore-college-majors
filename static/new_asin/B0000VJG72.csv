1950392,3,B0000VJG72,"I really wanted to like this movie---I even cut out of work early to see this movie, and well (sigh), here goes...
Matthias Whitlock {Denzel Washington--Training Day, John Q.} is the chief of police in small-town, who happens to be married and having an affair with his high-school sweetheart Anne Marei Harrison {Sanaa Lathan--Love & Basketball, Brown Sugar}, who is struggling with her own fidelity issues with an abusive husband, Chris Harrison {Dean Cain--host of Ripley's Believe It Or Not}, an former quarterback turned security guard who is bitter and strapped for cash.
One day, Anne Marei takes Matthias to the doctor where she learns she is terminally ill with cancer.  Treatments are expensive and not guaranteed to extend her life.  Whitlock decides to take measures into his own hands, and steal some drug money from a successful bust to help his lover.
On the night he is to deliver the money, Anne Marei's house has been burned to the ground, killing her and her husband!! Investigators suspect foul play and are looking for answers. To make matters worse, the lead detective is Whitlock's wife {Eva Mendes--Training Day}.
Now Whitlock, must solve this mystery and keep the rest of the force hot off his trail, before they discover the truth.
The movie draws you in without a problem, especially as Whitlock discovers some truths of his own.  But it's the last 20 or so minutes of dialogue/plot that it all went downhill.
Overall, not too bad.",1066521600,2,1458,4.91869918699187
1950393,4,B0000VJG72,"This was a very enjoyable murder mystery. Denzel was very good as usual. He didn't really wear a white hat or a black one, rather a grey one. Very exciting.",1066435200,,156,4.233333333333333
1950394,5,B0000VJG72,"""Out of Time"" has a super plot. What a enjoyable murder mystery and it's a great thriller. Denzel Washington plays Chief of Police Whitlock a cop who was set up for a murder he did not committ. The search is on for the real suspect. You'll like Washington as Chief Whitlock, and know he will figure it out and do the right thing in the end.",1066089600,3,340,4.166666666666667
1950395,3,B0000VJG72,"""Out of Time"" is a nice little exercise of the crackerjack plot, an entirely forgettable wrong-guy-accused yarn fit for its day in court some HBO Saturday night. But what is it doing as a big budget thriller? And what is Denzel Washington doing within 100 yards of it?
Not that Washington, now with two Oscars, hasn't slummed before - ""Fallen"" and ""John Q"" come to mind - but Dave Collard's script is too thin and Carl Franklin's direction too hurried for the movie to be anything more than a passing thought. And the casting is something else: Washington is forced to play love interest to Sanaa Lathan and Eva Mendes, women 17 and 20 years his junior. Washington has impressive range, but who knew the Ralph Macchio role was part of it?
The plot in a quickie: Washington is Matt Whitlock, a newly separated, small-town Florida cop in an affair with his high school sweetheart Anne Marei (Lathan) whose abusive husband (Dean Cain) is a former quarterback out of cash. During one afternoon tryst, Anne Marei takes Matt to the doctor with her, where he learns she has terminal cancer. After some stomach churning, Matt steals a half-million in confiscated drug money to help her pay for the alternative treatment in Switzerland.
The night she's to pick it up, she doesn't show. The next morning her house has burned down. And Matt's slated as beneficiary to her life insurance policy. Another complication: Matt's soon-to-be-ex-wife, Alex (Mendes), is the lead homicide detective on the case.
""Out of Time"" then shifts into a game of Matt eliminating clues that point to his guilt, tracking the source of the setup - a shiny nickel if you can guess that one - and taking an afternoon siesta to reminisce with Alex. Franklin zips through the material in an attempt to gloss over a criminal plan that not only doesn't hold up but never made sense in the first place.
In what is essentially an asexual role, Washington generates no heat with Mendes or Lathan. Mendes is naturally likable and good-looking in a Jennifer Lopez kind of way, but Alex and Matt's marriage is built on moviesphere, nothing more.
Beyond that, when it is ever good to take the smartest guy in the picture and figure him for a mark? If that actor is, say, Nicolas Cage, who can play loose and goose, that one's thing. But Washington sweats smarts, and while ""Out of Time"" shows Matt as light on his feet, it first must establish him as a dope - and a heel.",1065916800,20,2426,4.6573426573426575
1950396,2,B0000VJG72,"Denzel Washington is an incredible actor, including in this movie, but the story didn't do him justice.  Denzel is a police chief in a small town in Florida.  He appears to have been framed for the murder of a local woman, which is complicated by the fact that he was having an extramarital affair with her.  I lost almost all interest in the story because I couldn't help but think that all of his problems would be solved if he weren't lying to his wife, running around with another woman, and trying to cover it all up.  I wanted the moral fiber and character of Denzel in John Q or Remember the Titans.  Even Denzel's ""evil character"" in Training Day was more believable.  I saw this movie matinee, and I'm glad I didn't pay more to see it.",1065484800,4,744,4.355072463768116
1950397,4,B0000VJG72,"Director Carl Franklin's heroes (or heroines, as in Ashley Judd in ""High Crimes"") are caught up in situations beyond their control. They are good guys involved in bad, bad stuff: they do things that normal good guys wouldn't do but through circumstances, sometimes within their control, they commit crimes.
Denzel Washington is the ultimate Franklin hero: good looking, sexually charged and forthright, capable through his own personal charisma, to illicit confidence in an audience: we like him, we trust him, we know he will figure it out and do the right thing. Washington plays a small Florida town police chief, Matt Whitlock a man with a soon-to-be ex wife, Alex (Eva Mendes) and a girlfriend (Sanaa Lathan) who is married to ex-football jock, Chris Harrison (Dean Cain). From the outset of ""Out of Time"" you know, because of this quartet of characters and their intimate relationships that there is going to be trouble. And there is, of course...lots of it.
Washington and Lathan are dynamite together: the sparks fly when they are on screen together but Washington and Mendes doesn't really work. Mendes' reading of her lines is flat and without irony and because she has lots to do here, as opposed to being merely window dressing in ""Fast and Furious 2,"" the tension lags when she is around. Dean Cain on the other hand, working against type here, is first rate: his patented good looks have been beat up a little what with his goatee and unkempt hair. Nonetheless, his scenes with Washington sizzle with brute strength and machismo and even when he tries to pull off some charm by smiling that heartbreaking smile of his, it doesn't work as befits his smarmy character.
""Out of Time"" is quite beautiful to look at: with the deep blues, yellows and reds of the Florida landscape jumping off the screen and the humidity, suffocating in its omnipresence, drawing us in and making us sweat.",1065484800,7,1897,4.876160990712075
1950398,5,B0000VJG72,I went to see this after seeing such excellent reviews. I agree with those  reviews. Best movie of 2003. Pretty Darn Close. A enjoyable murder mystery. Denzel Washington plays Chief Whitlock an cop who was set up for a murder he did not committ. The search is on for the real suspect. You'll never guess the ending.,1065484800,4,315,4.526315789473684
1950399,5,B0000VJG72,"""Out Of Time"" is Denzel Washington's best movie since and after Antwone Fisher. Denzel stars as Matthias Lee Whitlock, Banyan Key, Florida's chief of police who gets caught up in a insurance scam involving drug money from one of his most recent arrests. Sanaa Lathan stars as Whitlock's former sweetheart, Ann Merai Harrison, who he unfortunately takes the drug money out of his evidence locker to in order to have a operation to save her life and get her away from her abusive former quarterback husband, Chris, played by Dean Cain. Eva Mendes stars as Alex Diaz Whitlock, Matt's soon-to-be ex-wife, who is a detective investigating the double homicide / arson of both Ann and Chris. A witness places Matt, who, unfortunately, was outside of Ann and Chris' house during the incident. Matt, himself, is investigating the crime and has to stay one step ahead of his colleagues in order to get back the money. Denzel is superb as Whitlock, in which, he echoes his Oscar-Winning performance in ""Training Day"", but, with more style and charisma to his performance in this extremely well made movie. The rest of the cast are intriguing and dynamic, but this is Denzel's show, I'm afraid. Go see this movie after you see ""School Of Rock"". I haven't seen ""School Of Rock"" yet, but these are the two movies you need to see this weekend! I enjoyed this movie because it had increasingly amazing twists and turns to its excellent ending. See this movie any time you can see it!",1065398400,2,1467,4.756862745098039
1950400,5,B0000VJG72,"Denzel Washington plays a man who makes two BIG mistakes but redeems himself with the help of his estranged wife and best friend.  The movie was full of suspense and told a story without a lot of gratuitous sex, vile language, or violence.  What a tasteful movie!!!",1065312000,,265,4.617021276595745
1950401,4,B0000VJG72,"I would have given it a '5' except for a couple of glaring loose-ends in the plot, like how the money miraculously appears at the end.  The pace is good, with well timed surprises and plot reversals.  However, about 2/3rds into the movie, the conclusion became a little obvious.  The dialog could have been a little more sophisticated.  Think 'Catch me if you can' but with more style and pace.",1065225600,,394,4.585714285714285
1950492,1,B0000VJG72,"Usually I like Denzel, but ouch... this one was BAD.

It starts out Ok, but it starts going down hill fast after about an hour. Like greased bowling ball down a steep hill fast.

This entire movie could have been resolved in a few minutes if Denzel's character just told the truth... like once in a blue moon. Also, apparently the entire message of the movie is ""don't get divorced?"" Like seriously, they have the line at the end ""don't divorce your wife, that's what happened to me.""",1512777600,,484,4.488636363636363
1950493,4,B0000VJG72,"Coming smack in the middle of Denzel's hot streak in the 2000's, Out of Time is crisp work by director Carl Franklin, returning to the theme of a small town cop involved with a beautiful woman and her horrible boyfriend (One False Move).  This time, the beautiful woman is the cosmic knockout Sanna Lathan, and her horrible boyfriend is Dean Cain (Lois & Clark), who projects some serious menace in his scenes with Denzel.  Franklin and Cain both deserve more work than they get.",1512604800,,479,4.690476190476191

1950557,3,B0000VJG72,"Definitely not one of Denzel's shining moments - mediocre, ignorable background entertainment at best. Painfully cliche, predictable plot with no surprises and almost no action. I watched the first bit then had it on while cooking dinner and didn't miss a thing while I was paying attention to the rest of the household and intermittently tuning back in. Works as background noise, and it's always nice to look at beautiful people like Washington and Mendes, but as a movie there's not much else to recommend it.",1508630400,,512,4.965116279069767

Denzel is a phenomenal actor so he did the best he could with what ""plot"" he had to work with, but this is just not a good movie, in my opinion.

1950605,4,B0000VJG72,"DENZEL!!. What a great actor! Denzel really immerses himself in his role and gives a tremendous performance in this action drama. I am surprised I missed this movie when it was released years ago. There is good dialogue, beautiful actresses, and much mystery and intrigue. Denzel's characters are not always the best role models and this movie is another example of this as he gets mixed up in a murder mystery and sexual exploits. What makes this movie so good is how his character stays one step ahead as he weaves himself in and out of trouble in clever ways. There are many twists and turns keeping the audience in suspense and rooting for the characters. The writing is very good with characters displaying great emotion, wit, humor, and ""believability"" in their roles. They also have a great rapport with each other whether they are on the same side or pitted against one another. Overall, this is a very enjoyable action movie that I definitely recommend",1507420800,3,961,4.795180722891566

1950607,5,B0000VJG72,"Man! Every time I watch this I feel like Im in the steamy Florida Keys strung out suspended in a hammock about to get in trouble with some local lady while my wife is coming is away at a shanty bar getting some drinks and about to be on her way back! (Disclaimer: Ive never been to the Keys and have no desire to cheat on my wife.) But this movie!!! Its sexy, steamy, sticky and fraught with about-to-get-caught tension with twists and turns that tumble you over, under, sideways, and down so that you're on the edge of your seat trying to catch your breath! The movie stars four principals, all attractive and/or handsome stars: Denzel Washington as Chief of Police, Matt Whitlock; Sanaa Lathan as Ann, a local whom Whitlock is having an affair with; Dean Cain as Chris, Anns abusive husband; and Eva Mendez as detective Alex Diaz, Whitlocks ex-wife, who is now in charge of investigating arson deaths at Ann and Chris house. The tension between these characters, be it sexual or adversarial or anxiety or whatever else, is often palpable and Whitlock who was having an affair with Ann and had wanted to do harmful things to Chris must stay one step ahead of his ex as she investigates a homicide that looks like he committed, though he didnt. Weve seen Denzel in a lot of tense movies but hes usually the guy in charge or the one who is putting everything together or back together; its refreshing to see him here poised but constantly on the verge of falling apart. The man is one of our current superior actors! This cat-and-mouse thriller treats us as the mouse. Its a thriller that shows how good someone can be at their job, and they're supposedly good, and how bad they can be because theyve been bad. Everyone steps up to the plate and crushes it. One of my favorite if not my favorite all-time thriller.",1506297600,,1813,4.513677811550152

1951501,3,B0000VJG72,"It's only getting three stars from me because I like Denzel Washington. He's a good actor. However, movies that start with explicit sex scenes aren't very good. It's proof, to me, that the writer/director/actors don't really have faith in the movie as a whole. It's possible to tell a damn good story without explicit sex scenes. If the writing is good, the direction competent and the actors talented, they don't have to set a hook in the audience with sex.

Lots of plot twists. I didn't think they were very interesting and some were downright unconvincing.

Too bad.",1473638400,,570,4.8061224489795915

""Out of Time"" is a first rate thriller, that will keep you on the edge of your seat when you see this movie the first time. The problem with this genre is once you've seen the movie once, the main surprise is gone. That's the film's primary weakness. This is still a very good movie. Perhaps, an even better movie is Mr. Franklin's ""Devil in a Blue Dress."" This is a stylish thriller, with a great script. This is a movie that should be reconsidered as one of the best movies of all time. It's right up there in the Roman Polanski ""Chinatown"" territory. And the LA police drama ""LA Confidential"" owes ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" royalties for borrowing many of the film and plot devices. ""Out of Time"" is a very good movie. ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" is a great movie.",1473206400,,918,4.405882352941177

thrilling, yes, thrilling parts that leave you a tad breathless!  Lest I give away any more of the show, for crying out loud WATCH  this flick....you will not

1952767,5,B0000VJG72,"I enjoyed this movie.  It isn't earth shattering or necessarily academy award winning--but it was a nice few hours spent to get away from the craziness of my life and slip into the craziness of Denzel's character's life.  And crazy it was...having an affair that almost cost him everything!  It is a little nerve wracking, watching Denzel go through the realization of the fact if he doesn't solve this thing, he will go down for murder. He is a flawed man, the Police Chief of a small town, so you gotta know he does not want to go on trial as a murderer, although only one other person  (besides the bad guys--and us, the audience) are aware of his desperation.  A twisty little plot, it takes you right to the edge of his life with the possibility of spending the rest of it behind bars.  Out of time is the right title--because he is definitely out of time.",1469318400,3,861,4.417721518987341

I didn't go all the way to 5 stars because the plot is more than a little unrealistic. I'm not that fussy about realism in action movies. This movie expects the viewer to accept quite a bit of incredible twists and turns even for a lover of fantasy like me.

1953205,4,B0000VJG72,"This is a very suspenseful and enjoyable film. A police chief in a small Florida town is framed for the murder of two people and it seems impossible for him to prove his innocence and to find the real killer. He is married to a police detective and had an adulterous sexual relationship with a married woman. His wife is looking into the murders.
The woman with whom he is having the affair tells him that she is dying of cancer and takes him to her doctor who confirms the diagnosis. The doctor tells them that if she had a lot of money she might go overseas and have an experimental procedure that could save her. He is holding about a half million dollars that the DEA wants him to hand over and keeps demanding the money. Instead, he lends her the money. She, in turn, makes him the beneficiary of a million dollar life insurance policy.
There is a fire and two bodies are found in the woman's house. If the police chiefs wife finds out that he had a relationship with the woman, which could be confirmed by the many telephone calls he made to her, that he was the beneficiary of her life insurance policy, and that he stole money and gave it to her, he would be the prime suspect.",1437523200,,1185,4.294642857142857

The movie was one that you couldn't miss one scene because you can not mis a moment, so riviting. Denzel has a very wide range when it comes to character acting and his facial expressions always are on point!
You just had to know the girl friend set it up, however I didn't know the doctor was involved until after Denzel found the real doctor. I don't recall ever seeing Dezel ever playing in, or at least his character, such a graphic movie as this one.

The thing I like about Denzel's acting is the little things he puts into his performances, the looks, the smiles, the little stutter he adds sometimes.  It all adds to the depth of the charter for me.  But I do like the over the top performance in Training Day and the take no prisoner roles he does.  This movie shows a  different side of him, someone not in total control and he plays that well.  I would recommend this movie along with other Denzel movies and you are sure to see someone that is a master of his craft.",1419811200,,698,4.007246376811594

The local pages of The Miami Herald were full of real crime dramas, sometimes unfolding in near real time. People found stuffed into 55 gallon drums and the like.
Edna Buchanan at ""The Herald"" kept us up to date on those stories we did and didn't want to know about.
Acting afforded by the chemistry OF THIS PARTICULAR CAST made all the difference between good and excellent and is the reason for my issue of five stars.
Good production values and as usual, the names Denzel Washington and Eva Mendes never disappoint when I am selecting films to watch. After all, entertainment is what it's all about.",1419292800,,739,4.56390977443609

1955021,4,B0000VJG72,"Story was ok.  Not one of Denzel's best but it was entertaining.  He is a detective who is separated from his wife and having an affair with a married woman.  Supposedly this woman is dying of cancer.  She makes Denzel's character the beneficiary on her million dollar life insurance policy.  A few weeks before this happened Denzel had made a big drug bust and the police confiscated a half million dollars in cash along with the drugs.  He decides to 'borrow' the money to fund a trip to Switzerland to get this woman cancer treatment.  After he hands over the money things get sticky.  Come to find out she never had cancer and was, in fact, not dying at all.  It's all been an elaborate scam to get her hands, along with her husbands, on this money.  So 2/3rd of the movie is Denzel trying to track down the two of them after they supposedly both died in a house fire.  Lots of twists and turns.  I would recommend this movie if you have the time on your hands.  But not worth it if you have something better to watch.",1419292800,,1022,4.315789473684211

1955286,5,B0000VJG72,"This is a fairly standard movie with an average plot.  A man has an affair with another man's wife.  The man is getting divorced from his own wife.  The other man takes out a huge insurance policy on his wife.  When the first man decides to run away with the other man's wife, the other man's wife turns up dead.  Pretty simple, but I do love Denzel Washingon's acting.  The movie is well acted.  The locations are varied and appealing.  I wish there had been a better plot.  But all in all this one works.  A few twists.  The first man is a police chief who steals 750k worth of drug money from evidence to pay for cancer treatment for the other man's wife.  Reason being, the police chief is banging the other man's wife.  Before they can run off the police chief arrives at the other man's house and finds them both dead then torches the place.  Turns out the police chief's wife is the detective investigating the fire and the homicides of the other two.  You'd have to watch the movie.  It's really not that confusing.  Halfway through the movie definitely picked up.  Turns out the woman the police chief was cheating with didn't have cancer afterall.  I'm not going to reveal the rest of the movie to you.  You really do need to see this flick.  In the span of an hour, the rating I planned to give this film went from a 3 to a 5.  Enjoy.",1418515200,,1345,4.274900398406374

The story is predictable and conventional, and the directing is oddly limp for what's supposed to be a suspenseful film. Even though they shot it in Florida it doesn't evoke much of a Florida feel -- and the fact that they had to invent a fictitious ""Banyan Key"" suggests they weren't even trying too hard.

1955545,3,B0000VJG72,"Denzel Washington has made a ton of movie and his history is dotted with watchable, middle of the road, films. This is one of those films.

Here's the scoop. Washington plays sheriff Mat Whitlock who resides over a tiny Florida town south of Miami. He's about to get divorced from Eva Mendez who has become a homicide detective in Miami. He's also having an affair with a local woman married to a failed quarterback (Dean Cain). When he finds that this woman has cancer he steals money, stored in evidence, from a recent drug bust to help her out. Then he realizes he's been set up and he needs to dig himself out of a deep hole.

This is the proverbial Hitchcockian type thriller. An innocent man (well....maybe not too innocent) is in a bad situation that seems impossible to dig out of. So it takes some clever work on his part, help from friends and the hand of God (and the screen writer) to save the day. There is a lot of good stuff here and then some not so good stuff. Denzel is no dummy. He puts clues together and peals away the layers of onion to get down to how it was he got set up. But, on the bad side, parts of the plot that would implicate Denzel in a heartbeat don't happen because someone is out to lunch or has left for the day. One comically played scene, where he is nearly identified as being on the scene at his girlfriend's house right before it is blown up, is really el stinko. Stuff like this helps bring down what might have been a much better movie.

Washington is good. Mendez is decent but looks so incredible I wouldn't care if she stepped all over her lines. John Billingsley, as Che the medical examiner, is pretty cool and keeps things from getting too overwrought.

Director Carl Franklin is a veteran and shows a certain efficiency here. That, along with generally good production values make this a very watchable flick. The problems it suffers are at the script level. But if you like mystery thrillers, you could do a lot worse.",1417910400,,1970,4.403846153846154

This is a movie that will certainly leave you on the edge of your seat.

***Spoiler alert BELOW***
However, I feel some parts of the story were left out. I didn't quite understand why Denzel(Captain Matt Lee Whitlock) had an affair with his beautiful high school sweetheart(Ann Merai Harrison)-played by Sanaa Lathan especially if he was still in love with his ex-wife(Alex Diaz Whitlock) played by Eva Mendes. What was his relationship like with his ex-wife and what led to their divorce? I highly doubt it was his infidelity alone. The story, itself, was nicely written, but it could have been better...it could have been more suspenseful. I gave it four stars because Mr. Washington's acting was awesome!!!",1403395200,,843,4.9787234042553195

1955649,5,B0000VJG72,"Talk about a psychological thriller with twists!  You never see them coming, and you never know how many there will be!  The writing is brilliant.  Denzel (Matt Whitlock) is having an affair with a married woman (Ann played by Sanaa Lathan) who is abused by her husband, Chris (Dean Cain plays SUCH a good bad buy)!  Matt and Ann are devastated at her doctor's visit to discover her cancer has returned and it is terminal.  She also discovers that her husband has taken out a $1 million life insurance policy on her...she quickly change the beneficiary to Matt.  She and her husband die in a blazing fire that night ... or do they?  What else can he believe?  His ex-wife (played by Eva Mendes), a homicide detective, is assigned to the case and requests Ann's phone records.  Matt is only one step ahead of the investigation and being found out as the beneficiary.  No one is who they seem to be which makes this movie all the more fascinating.

This movie is so well written, so well acted, so well directed, with a fast pace that will absolutely keep you on the edge of your seat, that I don't know how I missed it when it first came out!

Not only does it have you holding on wondering if he's gonna make it as it screams along, the seat belts are loose, its wobbling on the track, turning and twisting as it accelerates along racing your heartbeat this film snaps, crackles, and pops, moans, groans, strains, scrapes, and creaks along the old, worn out loops. Your knuckles are white from holding on so tight at the the sheer terror of the hotel room scene (John Frankenheimer and Fred Zinneman would hi-5 it). A superb film with spot-on acting all the way around. No one cooler under intense pressure than Denzel for the lead role - just as cool as Gary Cooper in High Noon. Will you make it back to the platform in one piece? Highly recommended.",1381190400,2,915,4.619631901840491

When the good guy is trapped in a jam where, as a lawman, Denzel Washington steps outside of the law to help a friend/lover (Sanaa Lathan) and ends up staying a half-step ahead of the law trying to rectify things, you can't help rooting for him all the way.  I didn't know sweet little Dean Cain could play such an evil guy (as husband to the friend of Denzel), and Eva Mendes (Denzel's separated wife) was a threat to him as well as a lawperson not knowing it was him she was after.  You've gotta watch it to follow all of this but I like it so well, this DVD is actually the second one I've bought to replace my lost first one.  I'd buy it again if anything happened to this one!

Chief Whitlock is not your typical Denzel role, and while he played it the best that he could, I just feel like it didn't suit him very well. The location of the movie didn't make a whole lot of sense, and that wasn't the only thing. Why would a detective from Miami and his ex-wife be investigating a crime an hour away in some small town? Miami PD isn't the FBI. The movie has a lot of plot holes and everything that happens is fairly obvious. It's entertaining, but it's not going to blow anyone away.",1361664000,,619,4.344827586206897

1955710,3,B0000VJG72,"This has all the feeling of a Hallmark made for TV movie. The same mind numbing background music (only slightly worse than elevator music.)

However even though you know the formula and pretty much can guess the ending it is still a pretty good time passer.

Jake (Jeff Fahey) a student archeologist finds a clue to the legendary lost treasure of Alexander. He is reluctant to peruse the treasure until he is pushed from behind by being accused of stealing the artifact clue and pulled by the nose by a girl (Camilla More) that has a tendency to go to bed and show of her accoutrements at the drop of a hat.

Will Jake find the treasure before the bad guys?
Does Jake get to keep the sleazy girl?
Will the bad guys triumph in the end?
Or do we all live happily ever after.

The main thrust of the movie is the chase as Jake and his friends snake their way around Egypt and Grease.

1955714,4,B0000VJG72,"Out of Time(released Oct/03)stars Denzel Washington as Matthias Lee Whitlock,Eva Mendes as Alex Diaz-Whitlock,Sanaa Lathan as Anne Merai Harrison and others. It is a good thriller that starts out slowly,then suddenly picks up speed as the plot shifts things into high gear.
The story sees Denzel as the Banyan Key,Fla.chief of police. He has an estranged wife in the form of Eva,and she is a detective. Thrown into this mix is Sanaa,who is secretly sleeping with Denzel. Sanaa has a boyfriend who works as an ambulance driver,and seems to be abusive towards Sanaa.
One day Denzel accompanies his girlfriend to the doctor. The doctor tells her she has terminal cancer and there is nothing short of some alternative treatments elsewhere that could save her. Sitting in a locked storeroom at the police station is $450,000 worth of drug money Denzel obtained from a recent bust,but at sometime will have to go to the DEA.He gets the idea to give the money to his dying girlfriend for an experimental treatment in Switzerland. She in turn makes him the beneficiary of a $1,000,000 insurance policy upon her death. The day she is to leave he is not hearing from her at all. He goes to her home to check on her and is spotted by a neighbour. He quickly leaves.
Shortly after his departure he gets a call that the house has blown up and his girlfriend and,presumably her boyfriend,are dead. He has lost the money,he is the beneficiary of her life insurance,he has been spotted at the scene,there are telephone calls made to him before she died,et al,which would point to Denzel's guilt in her death. Denzel's ex is put onto the case to investigate. Denzel is now in a race against time to do the impossible and cover his tracks before anyone can discover them and implicate him in their deaths. Along the way Denzel discovers something suspicious and goes to find the doctor that gave Sanaa her fatal diagnosis. However the doctor in question at the very office they were in originally,is a completely different doctor. Denzel recalls the first doctor handling a pen sitting on this doctors desk and takes it for fingerprints. It turns out the fellow is an ex morgue employee,who Sanaa's boyfriend knew very well.
Denzel tracks the man down to an apartment and the suspect ends up dying in a struggle. Denzel tries to leave undetected as his wife arrives to investigate. He recovers the drug money but soon gets a call from Sanaa who is alive and well. It was all a set up from the start. She gets him to an out of the way location where she and her boyfriend lay in wait. He comes and he ends up killing the boyfriend. However instead of coming with Denzel,Sanaa waves a gun at him and even shoots him in the leg. She apparently had been the mastermind behind it all and now she wants the money and/or Denzel dead. Just as Denzel is about to get his,his wife arrives and shoots Sanaa dead. The DEA arrives to collect their drug money,which Denzel has been trying to avoid for the entire day. The coroner and friend who had helped Denzel all the way,arrives(purposely)late saying he couldn't find the DEA building. The DEA reps go off in disgust,but at least ask no tough questions.
The film ends as Denzel and Eva have reconciled.
The film starts out very slowly,and one wonders where the thing is going. This,I believe,was purposely done,which almost backfires,considering the length of time it takes to get there. Also Denzel is playing a less than apathetic character which works against things too. However comes the moment when the house burns down""killing""his girlfriend and her boyfriend,that the intensity and flow of the movie change on a dime. From that point you become glued to the film wondering if Denzel can somehow outwit the authorities,especially his wife,in order to remain free and clear. And just when you think the pressure can't get any heavier,he learns that the whole thing has been a set up with the discovery of the ex morgue worker who was posing as Sanaa's doctor when she was fatally diagnosed with cancer. The film doesn't stop the roller coaster ride until just after Denzel's final confrontation with Sanaa. Then we breathe a little easier until the end fade out. John Billingsley as Denzel's friend the coroner,does a great job in his role.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include the trailer,commentary,two outtakes,a featurette,screen tests and more.
All in all a good thriller that doesn't pick up steam until well into its journey. It is almost the films' fatal flaw until the plot suddenly changes drastically and then it is hold onto your seats time as it shifts into high gear. A flawed but decent flick. 3 1/2 stars.",1354924800,,4709,4.750915750915751

I was interested in seeing Eva Mendes on film. I saw her in the film out recently. She is very pretty and plays Denzel's wife that he is on the outs with. I really don't want to go into the plot. There is a little bit of steaminess at the beginning and flattens out, there is mystery but not to much. I love that he lived on a boat that looked like a house and every morning he just went to the dock cafe to eat his breakfast. The town was very small and everybody seemed to know everybody. He had a really close friend named Chae, it felt like a town where it was safe and everybody was friends. I liked that most about the film.",1341446400,,788,3.93125
1955731,3,B0000VJG72,"This is not the heroic role that one might associate with Denzel Washington but a rather a seedy type of small town sheriff who is skating along the edge of propriety and stumbles in the wrong direction with a little help from an unexpected direction. A relationship with another man's wife develops into a serious problem when the woman disappears and seems to be dead.

The movie is about the sheriff's efforts to extricate himself from the mess as a noose of circumstantial evidence draws tighter around his neck. The first part of the movie focuses on a rather tawdry affair between the sheriff and the woman but when it appears he may have been involved in her death the pace picks up and it gradually turns into a fairly exciting action movie.

I found it hard to relate to the character of the sheriff but Washington did a good job of portraying the poor unfortunate who, thanks to some other friends who really cared, is able to bring resolution to the mystery.

Based on the second half I would give the movie 3.5 stars and suggest you watch before you buy.",1340064000,,1066,4.541666666666667

Its all for the best since his good-humored lusty young police chief unifies the plot and action providing the golden thread which holds the whole thing together. There is an adequate degree of suspense, a good deal of anything but straitlaced straight arrow behavior, and a good assortment of featured players for him to negotiate with, but in the end it is Washington's show. It is due to him that what might have been a hokey third rate cop in the hole show or a cheap lusty cop in bed and out sexpot ill-tasting stew, is turned into an almost James Garner can of humor-suspense-at heart good natured action film...with the barest minimum of shoot-'em-up bloodletting.

Washington's coolness, calculating and charisma jump off the screen.  ""Out of Time"" is full of riveting, twists, intrigue and farfetched encounters. Most importantly, it's a fun movie that you never get tired of watching again and again. Why?

""Out of time' has a spiraling out of control plot with beautiful cunning women and a handsome, but flawed, engaging leading man.  It's the complexity of human nature gone awry.  It's what happens when you mix love, friendship and greed in the same pot and wait for it to react.  It's explosive.

Watch ""Out of Time"" and see Denzel Washinton, Sanaa Lathan and Eva Mendes explode!

Being someone attracted to good visuals, I loved the colors in this film, set in South Florida. The orange-and-greens were beautiful and I enjoyed the music, too. It all elevated the likability of this modern day film-noir for me.  I have to admit at one point I began wondering ""when is something violent going to happen?""

He goes with her to a doctor's appointment and she is told that she has inoperable cancer and will die within a year.  She is later told that she can go out the country for an expensive treatment that may give her several additional years.  She tells Washington she can't possibly afford the treatment so she will just accept what fate has dealt her.

Washington decides to ""give"" her a large sum of ""evidence"" cash that nobody will miss so she can have the experimental treatment.  Apparently, the case is over and nobody will look for the cash for a number of years.

Things go totally wrong for Washington after that as the wife and her husband are killed in a ""suspicious"" house fire of which a neighbor spotted Washington outside the house just before the fire started.  Additionally, just prior to her death the woman was changing her life insurance beneficiary to Washington (giving him motive) and then the DEA all of a sudden demands the evidence money because it can be tied to another case.  To top it off, Washington's estranged wife is leading the investigation into the two murders so he has to avoid her getting any sense that he might have been involved.  To say any more about the movie would be a big spoiler but the movie is loaded with twists and turns.

Denzel Washington stars as the sheriff of a small and idyllic Florida town who's faced with an ethical dilemna when his love is diagnosed with a fatal disease that's potentially curable, but only at an extremely high cost that her insurance won't cover.  The sheriff can get his hands on the money needed easily enough - it's in the form of the ill-gotten gains of Florida drug dealers, sitting indefinately in the evidence safe at the local police station.  He works out a plan he can live with that would provide the needed treatment without trampling on his integrity and principles more than would be bearable, but what seems workable gets a lot more complicated when some very unexpected events begin occuring.  Scams and cons, ethical shades of grey, double-crosses and plot twist after plot twist crank up the suspense and action to uncanny levels, and ample doses of comedic content that could have been sorely out of place manage to fit in perfectly and just make the whole show better and more fun.  Spearheaded by Washington, the whole cast turns in excellent performances and complete the job of taking this stunner into the upper reaches of moviedom.

Rather than sharing the truth with his friend and his wife, he goes and does one stupid/criminal/incriminating thing after another.  The fact that Denzel Washington gets out of this situation in tact is solely because of either a) luck or b) a friend covering up for him.  eg..Good grief, how many police officers don't know their chief's cell phone number in a small town.

1955836,3,B0000VJG72,"I found it odd that Denzel Washington, an actor rarely linked with romance in films, has romantic relationships with two 20-somethings in ""Out of Time"" and is supposed to play someone in his mid-30s. This was only the first plot twist that fractured my concept of suspended reality in this flick.

To put it more directly, I could not believe much of what was occurring on screen in this film. I enjoyed the movie and agree it is a good thriller, but I cannot lend much credibility to the overall film. I'd like to say this movie is a great work of art, but it isn't. It has many very entertaining moments but its weaknesses outnumber its strengths, in my opinion. The end product is it is not a very memorable film, although it could have been with more appropriate casting and direction.

There were too many coincidences, too many plot twists that could never occur in real life, and too many miscast characters, the first being Washington's wife that was a police investigator but looked and dressed like she was a model throughout the film. Her lipstick and eyebrows were so beautiful and so artistically done that...well, I couldn't believe she was a cop. She exhibited about as much police acumen and investigative imagination as a supermodel, too. This was a ridiculous piece of casting done obviously to show off a beautiful person.

The Amazon review said this movie was, ""Partly inspired by 1948's 'The Big Clock' and its nominal 1987 remake 'No Way Out', the Denzel Washington thriller Out of Time is quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting."" That is very generous praise, indeed. I see a relationship between Kevin Costner's remake of ""No Way Out"" and this film but none between the classic ""The Big Clock"" with Ray Milland.

If you order those films in terms of their place in Hollywood legend, ""The Big Clock"" is up among the top 200, ""No Way Out"" is among the bottom half of the film's of its decade and this movie is even lower than that.

1955839,3,B0000VJG72,"""Out Of Time"" is a good thriller. Simply put, it's a 'who-dunit' movie with good acting, good story, decent script, great locations, and pretty good directing.

Like in my title of this review, this movie isn't going to win any awards or anything. But, it is definately worth the price of admission. Denzel Washington plays a cop that is sleeping with this high school sweetheart behind her husband's back. To complicate matters, his soon-to-be ex-wife is back in town. She works for the FBI. After he is framed for the murder of his mistress and her husband, she is put on the case. At this time, nobody even thinks to imagine the police chief would be involved in such a crime. And not only is he being framed for the murders, but the drug-bust money that he gave his mistress the night she died (she needed it for cancer treatments) has come up missing and the DEA wants their money. The problem is he can't explain what happened to it.

I know that sounds complicated and convuluted, but it's not a bad plot. It has many twists and turns that keep you guessing....most of the time. Basically, Denzel runs around the whole movie trying to stay one step ahead of the FBI and the invistagtors all the while trying to find proof of his innocence. He has to try to solve the crime himself, while at the same time trying to keep the FBI off his tail.

It does keep you on the edge of your seat at times. And it is interesting to see how he can play both sides of the fence while actually keeping his sanity. The pacing of the movie is a bit slow at times, espcially at the beginning. The whole movie has a bit of a sexy feel to it and it definately has the steamy Florida thing down. The problem I had with the story was that it was too obvious to me what the ending was going to be. I saw it coming a mile away, which usually kills movies like this. But the acting was so good, it made up for the shortcomings of the script.

Denzel is the man. I have always said that. He picks some stinker movies sometimes, but he is always good in them. ""Out Of Time"" is no exception. He just plays the role perfectly. He is constantly going against the clock in this flick and portrays a constant sense of urgency. He is just a guy who made the wrong decision and tried to help someone and is now getting screwed because of it. You never really think, ""Well, this guy is technically cheating on his wife while sleeping with someone else's wife....."". He is that good.

Eva Mendes really proved to me that she can act with this role. I haven't seen her in many movies before this, but I was impressed by her. She plays well opposite Denzel and owns the screen when she is on it. Sanaa Lathan is pretty good here, as well. The two ladies steam up the screen and take some of the heat off the lead. John Billingsly plays a perfect side-kick to Denzel's character. He is the comic-relief, and has very clever diologue and gives the movie a light-harted tone it needs. He was my favorite character in the movie.

The one actor that surprised me the most was Dean Cain. He plays a 'badguy' role here and does it quite well. Like the women of the picture, when he is on screen, you just watch. It's such a different role than he has previously played, that it may shock some people. I would definately like to see him in future movies and I still think he would make the perfect Superman in the newer, upcoming movies.

I liked this movie, but it just felt like it was missing something. The pacing was a bit slow and the ending was predictable, but I enjoyed the flick. If you can get this DVD for under $15, I would snatch it up and enjoy a good thriller. You won't be disappointed.

Special Features: There is a boring, but informative audio commentary from the director, Carl Franklin. Most of the time he just talks about the locations of what is on screen and some technical stuff. It's not the most entertaining I have heard, but it's informative. Then you get the usual crappy promotional featurette. I hate those things. Basically it's the actors just raving about each other and the director. There are outtakes and screen tests, and the trailer. I know this has ""special edition"" written at the top of the box, but I didn't find it all that special.",1094428800,8,4240,4.351453855878635
1955840,4,B0000VJG72,"`Out of Time', a Denzel Washington thriller showcase directed by Carl Franklin is an object lesson in how to put a character into a bad situation, then turn up the heat until it seems he cannot escape his predicament, and he feels the pressure all the more so because it was created to a great extent through his own mistakes. It is easy to put heroic people into desperate situations, subject to terror and the brink of death, yet their entire predicament is for a just cause. The feeling you have, for example, for Frodo and Samwise on the slopes of Mount Doom surrounded by lava is quite different from the feelings you have for Washington's character. This is true not the least because it is so much easier to associate with a person bound in a web of his own mistakes than it is with a hobbit bound in the web of a giant spider.

This is the stuff that tragedies are made from, except that instead of being destroyed by the situation of his own making; the hero does manage to make it out in the nick of time. The best part of his ultimate liberation is that it is brought about by the help of a very good friend who covers for him on two critical points in the story without even being asked and with an assist from his estranged wife who also happens to be a police officer working on the case which drives the plot.

Washington is the chief of police for a small town on a small Florida key island, very similar to his role in his earlier movie `The Mighty Quinn'. His recently separated wife is a homicide lieutenant in some much larger, overlapping jurisdiction, possibly the Miami / Dade police force. Washington's best friend is the local medical examiner. In the opening of the movie, it is revealed that Washington is having an affair with an extremely attractive local dental technician married to a former NFL football player who is currently employed as a security guard at the local hospital. It is also revealed that Washington has about 450 thousand dollars in cash in his office safe confiscated from a recent drug bust.

The main action of the story is set in motion when Washington's mistress talks Washington to accompany her to her oncologist who reveals that an earlier malignancy has reoccurred and is in an incurable state. After the expected distress, compounded by what is believed to is an abusive husband, the woman signs a 1 million-dollar life insurance policy over to Washington as beneficiary. Washington, thinking the drug money will be tied up in court procedures for months, turns it over to his girlfriend in order to get expensive experimental treatment for cancer. Shortly thereafter, bodies of girlfriend and husband are found in the ruins of their house set on fire by arson shortly after a witness sees Washington running away from the victims' house.

All this easily adds up to evidence against Washington, giving him clear means, motive, and opportunity. The pressure mounts as Washington's wife is assigned the case and sets up shop in the town's little police station, right outside Washington's office. The pressure gets turned up as the head of the Miami DEA office calls Washington for the drug money and wants it `yesterday'. So, the second act is largely Washington desperately working at staying one step ahead of both his wife and the DEA.

The average viewer will figure out part of the mystery with little trouble, but I won't spoil the fun by revealing it here. The full story, however, is not revealed until the very end. And, the construction of the problem for Washington and his being able to resolve it at the very last minute makes great entertainment spiced up by the very believable situation. There is an almost dreamlike quality to Washington's predicament. No matter what he does, things just seem to get worse, without quite catching up to him.

The resolution between Washington and his wife after the case is closed seems a bit improbable, but I can live with that. This is by far the most excitement I have experienced with a PG-13 movie in quite a long time. The writers were even able to keep the body count down, limited to the immediate perps of the crime.

Highly recommended for all with reasonably good nerves.",1093824000,5,4193,4.673441734417344

It seems like there are guardian angels watching over Denzel Washington in this one!  Every time it looks like he's going to get caught, something happens that gets him off the hook.  Clever, if improbable.  Without rehashing the plot, it is to Denzel's credit that he makes Matthias Whitlock and engaging hero.  He's duped big time by his girl friend, played sexily by the lovely Sanaa Latham and her husband, Dean Cain in one of his more convincing performances.  His estranged wife played with gusto by Eva Mendes gets into the scenario, and so does Denzel's drinking buddy, played by John Billingsley, who manages to steal every scene he's in.

Although slow in the beginning, once the pace picks up, we get some tense action scenes.

1955855,2,B0000VJG72,"Out of Time is a strictly routine mystery movie, competently made but nothing more than that.  It is what I think of as ""sunny noir"" - a standard film noir story taken out of the gritty city streets and moved to a sunny beach community.  In this case, it involves Denzel Washington as a small town police chief whose estranged from his homicide detective wife and sleeping with his old girlfriend, who is in turn still married to her abusive husband.
When Washington finds out his girlfriend has cancer, and that the only treatment is an expensive experimental treatment in Switzerland, he steals some evidence money to help her.  Then, she and her husband are apparently killed in a fire, but that quickly turns out to be a con.  Suddenly, Washington is stuck in a perilous place; on the one hand, he must evade his wife, who is investigating the crime and on the other, he must retrieve the money (which the DEA wants).
As stated before, this is an utterly routine movie, with little to distinguish it from a dozen or more movies that seem to cover the same ground.  Washington's performance is good but nothing special; the action scenes are only moderately exciting, and in general, the writing is bland, with no real plot twists (even the ""twist"" of the fake deaths can be seen a mile away).  The scenery is nice, but any pluses from that are more than offset by the negatives of one character, a medical examiner who seems to be there for comic relief and just winds up disrupting the tone of the film.  With nothing really good to distinguish this movie, I can only rate it a high two stars and cannot recommend it for any but the most die-hard Denzel Washington fans.",1087344000,2,1675,4.5633333333333335
1955856,3,B0000VJG72,"First of all, I respect Denzel Washington fully seeing that he is one of my favorite actors of all time. His talent has made every movie (he has starred in) a classic. However ""Out of Time"" is a very bad example of this. Don't get me wrong...it's a good movie, however the first hour is just dull. His character is having an affair with a woman...and is caught up with her current husband (who is being very abusive). This continues throughout 75% of the movie. It's great acting but it just had me trying to figure out where it was all headed. Then suddenly the suspense begins! Finally...
From this point on the movie gets very good...in which it continues to pull you in every direction, shocking you when something wrong is about to happen to Denzel's character. I very much enjoyed the final 25% of the movie...that's why it got a 3 Star rating from me. I fully feel that if the first 75% of the movie had been deleted and I was just handed the final part of the movie with no begining...I would be fully satisfied. However I was bored out of mind....praying it would get good soon.
I'm not saying to avoid this movie, instead just watch it if you've seen every movie...except this one. It is a movie that is slow at the begining..very....very...slow. But I promise you that it picks up in the end. Your best bet is to skip a lot of chapters until the end...then enjoy.
Out of Time is not Denzel Washington's finest movie, but a decent one at that. This is a movie to RENT...not to BUY.

1955858,3,B0000VJG72,"""Out of Time"" is the story of Banyan Keys chief of police Whitlock (Denzel Washington), a man in the middle of a divorce he does not want.  Whitlock turns to his old high-school sweetheart, Ann Harrison (Sanaa Lathan) for solace, only to learn that she has terminal cancer and cannot afford the alternative treatment that might be her only hope.  Whitlock can't just watch Ann die, so he steals a large chunk of money he bagged in a drug bust from his own department and lets her have it.  But then Ann and her abusive husband Chris (Dean Cain)go up in smoke in an apparent arson, triggering a legal fallout that leaves Whitlock struggling to tie up all the loose ends as his life unravels around him.
""Out of Time"" is a somewhat formulaic but still successful mystery/suspenser that slowly pulls the viewer into the web along with Chief Whitlock until there's no escape.  Fans of this kind of movie will see a lot of familiar set-ups and plot devices, but the strong cast makes the story work as a whole even if you think you've got it all figured out.  Washington's hapless cop is unfailingly appealing, even if he is guilty of some terrible lapses in judgment (but then aren't we all from time to time?).  Cain and Lathan likewise do well with their roles, and Eva Mendes is a standout as Whitlock's estranged wife, a homicide detective in her own right who slowly discovers more than she wants to about her husband's role in the Harrison case. Will Whitlock be able to put the puzzle together in time to save his skin from a looming murder rap?  And will Mendes help pull him out of the fire, or push him all the way under?  You can't stop watching til you know the answers.
The film's seedy, noirish atmosphere is a great plus as well, and if it's not original ""Out of Time"" is still entertaining.  Overall it's worth 3.5 stars, and certainly a movie you want to watch at least once if you like mystery or suspense films. Like many of its kind, however, it may not hold up to multiple viewings once you've learned the secrets, so it may be one to rent rather than buy.  Either way, it's a great way to energize a lazy evening.",1084060800,52,2131,4.441025641025641
1955859,4,B0000VJG72,"In fact, there is nothing wrong with the thriller ""Out of Time"" even though you can tell the truths behind the conspiracy from the beginning.  It is pure entertainment with no particular social message (and that's not a bad thing to me), supported by good acting all around and the humid atomosphere of Florida.
The story reminds you of Kevin Costner thriller ""No Way Out,"" but Denzel Washington's character, police chief Matt Lee Whitlock is more convincing than the other.  He just wants to do his jobs well and have some happy time with his love Ann, though he knows he cannot forget his (now estranged) wife (and homicide detective) Alex played by Eva Mendes.
Then, a murder happens in his town.  Matt starts to investigate the case, but somehow every evidence points to the most unexpected person -- himself!  While dodging the investigations from his suspecting wife and unfriendly FBI guys, Matt almost single-handedly has to find out the truths behind the complicated case.
The script by David Collard (for the first time for feature film) has nothing special in it, but director Carl Franklin helms the film with assured hand, and seldom stops the motion.  The suspence is created tactfully, but if you are a kind of person who does not believe in the police chief (who should be wise enough) relying on the incredible ruses, well, then, Denzel Washington would make you do with his good acting, as usual.  (Of course, that does not mean this is his best, though.)
Other actors are also good; ever-gorgeous Eva Mendes is much better here (than in ""2 Fast 2 Furious""), as a credible and energetic detective, and Dean Cain also gives us surprisingly good acting as a bullying husband (though his fans may not like it).  The best prize, however, goes to John Billingsley, who plays the coroner (and the only ally to Denzel Washington), whose disarming humor is another added charm to the otherwise ordinary sketches of characters.
""Out Of Time"" is a pure entertainment, and pretty good at that.  There are many big plot holes here, but you may forget and forgive them because of the thrill you get ... well, almost.",1083369600,3,2121,4.791780821917809

The problem is this, the film sets the stage as being a realistic, intelligent, suspense thriller, and then doesn't deliver ( at least not the first two ). The story goes way out there, as not a single police officer/agent is doing their job correctly, as well as not a single person acting with any rationale at all. In fact, can anyone make any sense of any one's motives when all is said and done?
I felt let down more so than some others may be, being a huge Denzel Washington fan as well as a suspense thriller enthusiast.

1955874,3,B0000VJG72,"A film by Carl Franklin
""Out of Time"" is a reasonably slick drama about who really committed a crime.  The setting is Banyon Key, Florida and Matt Whitlock (Denzel Washington) is the chief of police.  He is having a rather torrid affair with Ann Harrison (Sanaa Lathan), a woman who is married to a former football player Chris Harrison (Dean Cain).  Ann has long since told Matt that Chris hits her, and naturally Matt is angry about this, but because he is keeping the affair secret he can't exactly confront Chris about the hitting.
It turns out that Ann has cancer and that she cannot afford any treatment.  Matt tries to help get her the money, including a scheme that would permit her to cash in on her life insurance policy while she is still alive.  These schemes don't work so Matt decides to steal money from the police station that was captured in a drug raid.  Ann changes her life insurance policy to now list Matt as the beneficiary.  Matt tries to give Ann the money late one night and is seen going to her house.  With the way the film is edited as Matt walks away we see the house now in flames before Matt reappears back at his home.  Both Ann and Chris are believed dead (there are two charred skeletons in the house, and Matt knows that he will be the number one suspect if any hint of his connection to Ann leaks out.
The rest of the film is Matt playing damage control, trying to hide his involvement as well as figure out what happened.  Matt's ex wife Alex (Eva Mendes) is the lead federal investigator on the case and perhaps because of how close she used to be to Matt, she is able to see that Matt is acting a little strangely when nobody else even has a clue.  As the movie progresses, there are twists upon twists (especially at the end) and some things begin to be a stretch in credulity.
This is a decent enough movie, but the way Matt is able to get away with so many things in this movie stretches the bounds of how believable the action is.  Unfortunately, when that happens I get taken out of the movie and start analyzing.  That is never a good thing.  ""Out of Time"" is a bit on the predictable side and when the final and biggest twist happens at the end I thought, ""Well, of course, why wouldn't [that person]?"".  What you get out of this movie depends on what you are looking for.  If you want a fairly fun piece of entertainment with an extremely talented lead actor...this is for you.

""Devil in a Blue Dress"" was his first pairing with Denzel Washington.  This is a respectable body of work.
""Out of Time"" is excellent because of the fine performances turned in by Denzel, Dean Cain and Sanaa Lathan.  Denzel gives a depth of character to all of his roles.  It was nice to see him as the good guy again after ""Training Day.""  Dean Cain is amazing in his role as the husband.  This performance has to be a career high for him.  Sanaa as Ann gives an edgy performance that is convincing.
The many plot turns and twists kept me surprised.  I bought the cancer scare completely, but was a bit puzzled that Washington was going to compromise his job by making an off-the-books loan.

Denzel Washington plays Matt Whitlock, a police chief in Banyan Keys, FL who has been abandoned by his wife recently and is involved in a relationship with Ann, a married woman. Everything goes well until Matt finds out that Ann has cancer, which was in remission but has come back with a vengeance and she has only six months left to live.

I saw an interview where Denzel even commended Dean on his performance. Believe it our not, Denzel had never heard of him before.

1955887,4,B0000VJG72,"This is a good movie, not great, but good.  It has a plot where you are wondering how the Chief of Police from a small town of 1800 can get himself into such a big mess and try to cover his tracks while his estranged wife is investigating the supposed murder of the chiefs girl friend.
Chief Whitlock (Denzel Washington) is constantly on the move, whether he is shacking up with his high school sweetheart or running after the money she connived him out of.
There are a few twists in the movie, enough to surprise you.  Whitlock attempts to stay one step ahead of his Detective Whitlock (Mendes) and you sometimes are left wondering how he did it.  There is interplay with these two characters, she still has feelings for her husband, yet, you are left wondering why she left him in the first place.
There are some interesting plays between characters, Chae, Whitlocks Medical examiner and friend.  For some reason, everyone is loyal to Whitlock.  You wonder if this is the first time he has been in trouble and what he has done to maintain the loyalty of his friends and co-workers.
I would recommend seeing the Profiles of the Characters before you see the DVD.  The profiles are a good introduction to the movie and gives a good foundation to build on.
This movie is worth viewing, however, the scenes between Washington and Lathan were a little too drawn out and could have been aluded to in order to broaden the range of viewers and viewer appeal.
The trailers did not give the story away, so I was surprised at the plot and movie overall.  It is a good watch, and worth the time if you want to be entertained.
The DVDs outtakes are weak, only two, and added because they had to be.  I wondered if they were staged so they could have outtakes.

Can he outwit the police investigation being conducted by his soon-to-be ex-wife and figure out who set him up and why?
Well, if you think this equates to a suspenseful, well-acted action film with Denzel Washington...you are indeed out of luck.
Denzel spends the course of the film covering up his tracks and trying to distance himself from the apparent set-up. These events are not only baffling to Denzel's character (Matt Whitlock), but also to anyone watching the film. And while it's never quite clear why anyone would want to set up Denzel's character, by the end of the film, you won't even care.

1955903,3,B0000VJG72,"In ""John Q,"" Denzel Washington played an uninsured man so desperate to get medical treatment for his ailing child that he took over an entire hospital emergency room, precipitating a full-blown hostage crisis in the process.  Now, in ""Out of Time,"" Washington plays a chief-of-police in Florida so desperate to get medical treatment for his terminally ill girlfriend that he steals over $400,000 in impounded drug money, resulting in a great deal of trouble for himself when she turns up mysteriously murdered.  Do we note a pattern here?
""Out of Time"" takes its cue from ""Charade"" and any number of Hitchcock films in which an innocent person becomes enmeshed in a complex scheme perpetrated by people who are not what they pretend to be.  Though we can never take ""Out of Time"" seriously even for a single moment, the film does do a good job spinning out its story, making us empathize with a man whose entire career is on the line should the finger of suspicion alight on him.  It is Washington's job here to make sure he stays two steps ahead of everyone else to prevent that from happening, and it is in watching him frantically do so that we derive our pleasure.  It is, however, imperative that we suspend our disbelief for the duration of the film in order to enjoy it.
Washington isn't required to do a great deal of acting here and one wishes that he would choose roles with a bit more substance and meat to them.  But ever since he won his Oscar for ""Training Day,"" he seems to be content to kill time appearing in efficient but soulless exercises such as this one (""Antwone Fisher"" being the obvious exception).  ""Out of Time"" is perfectly enjoyable while you're watching it, but it doesn't stick with you in any meaningful way once it's over.  Washington can - and, I'm sure, will - do better in the future.",1074988800,2,1820,4.613003095975232
1955904,4,B0000VJG72,"I thought this was a good movie, again not perfect or oscar material like some of other Denzel washington work, but still enjoyable.  Washington is Cheif Matt Whitlock who at the beginning makes some very bad mistakes that come back to haunt him.  As he and alex (eva mendes) were on the verge of getting a divocere, he has an affair with ex-girlfriend Ann (sanaa lathan who has been in flicks like (blade, love and basketball, and Brown Sugar).  This was Matt first mistake.  His second mistake was when Ann went to the doctor and supposedly has cancer, decides to become the beneificary for her life insurance policy.  His third mistake was stealing money for a sting operation to help pay for Ann to have surgery.  Chris Harrison (Dean Caine) who was a mean and suspicious husband used this cancer situation to his advantage and get back at Matt.  How does he do it?  Supposedly, the Harrison's house was set on fire and they were supposedly killed.  Matt last mistake was when he and Ann were supposed to meet to pick up the drug money when over to the house, where some people saw him and believed he was the culprit for this act of arson.  Just like the Negotatior (the movie where Samuel L. Jackson had to prove he did not kill his partner and find out who did), Matt was indeed running out of time before all sources were to point toward him.  Of course his soon to be ex-wife who involved in the case.  Matt found out some interesting things concerning Ann.  He found out the doctor that she saw with him is not a real doctor and that her real doctors have reported that she has always been in good health.  While Matt was at the station, he lied, evade and did everything a deseperate man would do to save himself.  He does have a confortation with the fake doctor and does find the Harrisons.  He then finds out what all was going on. Chris might have been behind the whole plan but Ann did some role in it as well.  Alex ends up coming to the aid to keep him from being killed by both Harrison's and they do get back together.

This movie is just a suspenseful as 24 Hours and definitely gets my vote for ""a movie to purchase"".  Denzel is dynamic as usual and his actions keep you at the end of your chair and shouting at the screen.  Pick this one up today!!!",1074729600,2,485,4.020833333333333
1955906,2,B0000VJG72,"I don't know what is more bothersome--watching this type of forgettable garbage or learning that some folks give it five stars.
This ""suspense"" flick will keep you on the edge of your seat only if:
A.  You have a very small seat,
B.  You have a very large backside, or
C.  Some visual impairment prevents you from noticing huge plot holes and over-emphasized hints.
As far as the acting goes, even on autopilot (and making an appearance for the sake of a paycheck,) Denzel's talent raises this contrived tripe somewhat out of the gutter.  Aside from this, there are no performances that rise above the level of boring.  This isn't a knock against the actors, the truth of it is that the characters in this film (i.e., Cold Ex-Wife, Abused Woman, Absolutely, Totally, Without Remorse Evil Man, and Fat, Funny Sidekick) have been so overused that original incarnations of them are nearly impossible.
The casting in this film is insulting...Denzel Washington and his mistress, the script tells us, were once high school sweethearts.  Well, as their ages are separated by almost two decades, either Denzel's character (Matt Whitlock) spent quite a few years failing grades or his ""sweetheart"" was infant at about the time Whitlock was graduating.  Oh, Whitlock is married in this film, though separated, and, if you can believe it(!), a woman even younger than his mistress was cast as his wife.  Yes, it's a constant gripe of mine, but can the audience please see men and women of similar ages playing the roles of husband/wife, husband/mistress?  Especially when the script tell us they're within a few years of one another!
Now, the screenplay.  Wow.  My first thought is that, when Denzel signed on, the writers decided there was no need for further rewrites.  Any and all suspense and tension is lost when clues are shoved down the viewer's throats and this might have been prevented had care been taken.  I don't want to give any particulars, but, if you're halfway paying attention, then there are probably half a dozen scenes in the film where the director could have been less conspicuous by having the actors stop speaking and pull out large neon signs baring the words ""HERE IS A CLUE.""  For example, when a character, early in the film, goes into a long explanation and demonstration of how his cell phone is linked to GPS tracking system...well, unless you're braindead, you can bet this is going to be on the test.
As well, little in this film occurs because it is in the natural order of things; no, what happens here only does because the script demands it.  You know that point in a horror film when the girl has a choice between getting in her car and driving to safety or going, by herself, into the dark house?  The only reason she walks through the doorway is because the movie ends if she doesn't.  That same necessity for stupidity appears to be behind the actions of all the characters in ""Out of Time.""  In short, everyone is this film is stupid when the script demands it and brilliant when needed.  As such, the characters never are believable because they fail to rise above the level of plot device.  And that's sad, for to feel suspense the audience must be concerned with whom they're seeing...and that never happens here.  Without revealing too much, a wonderful example of this is when characters A, B, and C con D out of large sum of money.  Now, the wise thing for the scammers to do would be to leave town...after all, they do have a half-day head start and a nice bankroll...but that wisdom wouldn't happen here.  No, instead, one of the baddies goes to a hotel and the other two hide out in an abandoned shack.  Why do they do this?  Why don't they take the half-million and charter a boat to the islands or flee north to Miami?  If they do...movie over.  Why does the group separate?  Because, if our hero catches them all at once, then the film ends at hour one...having the members apart almost doubles the running time.  Why is the money held by the weakest link in the villain chain (especially when we know that the cash was handed directly to main conspirators)?...the movie requires it.  Why doesn't the protagonist, having ""caught"" a bad guy and retrieved the loot, not turn to the police (or, at least, have the police accompany him for ""THE FINAL SHOWDOWN?""...the movie won't let him.
...and it goes on and on.
I don't require perfection from films, but don't insult me.  If you want a good suspense flick where you care about the hero...where you twist and turn right along with him...then check Michael Douglas in ""The Game"" and leave this formulaic trash on the shelf of Blockbuster.",1074643200,9,4631,4.687268232385661
1955907,4,B0000VJG72,"""Out of Time"" is a great movie and truthfully, it is a very rare case that Denzel Washington picks a bad script.  The only reason I took one star off of this movie is the predictability of the overall plot.  Despite that predictability, ""Out of Time"" is a movie that is well worth your time for the intensity of the suspense factor alone; is he guilty, will he be found out; which way is this going to go, are just some of the things that goes through your mind when watching this wonderful film that is well worth taking the time to watch and enjoy!
Denzel Washington performs brilliantly in this film, as he does with every film he shows up in.  This is probably the first film I've watched that had Dean Cain in it and for the role he's in, he does a very good job.  I believe the only other film that I've seen Eva Mendes in is ""Training Day,"" another exceptional Denzel Washington film, and her performance was dead on the mark for the role in which she plays.  Another newcomer, Sanaa Lathan, an actress whose work I've never seen before, proves with this movie that she's one to look out for in future films.  For ""Star Trek Enterprise"" fans, John Billingsley shows up in this film and performs quite well, in a role that seems extremely befitting for his personality.
This is the first film that I've watched with Carl Franklin as the director and I would definitely have to say that I was impressed with the film, despite the predictability factor and any future work by this director should be looked forward to.  The score works perfectly for the film, greatly enhancing the dramatic feel of this thriller.
The Premise:
Welcome to small town America, Banyan Key, Florida where Police Chief Matt Lee Whitlock (Denzel Washington) finds himself in a sordid relationship with Ann Harrison (Sanaa Lathan), who just happens to be ""married"" to Chris Harrison (Dean Cain).  The intensity of the film heats up pretty soon as there is what ""appears"" to be a murder and the most likely murderer seems to be the chief of police himself...
What follows from there is a film that is somewhat predictable but still quite intense and enjoyable as you follow Denzel Washington's character going through the motions caused by the situation he's found himself in.
I would definitely recommend this film to any and all who are fans of fairly well scripted, suspenseful thrillers and for the fact that one of Hollywood's best actors in Denzel Washington is in the lead role.  {ssintrepid}

1955908,4,B0000VJG72,"This is probably the most Hitchcockian thriller to come down the pike in a decade or so. You have the flawed man unjustly accused. You have a femme fatale who may or may not be dead. Thorny relationships with women. Atmosphere by the bucketload. Sexy, slightly violent, a tad morbid, bundles of wit and humor.
This was a sadly ignored film during its' theatrical run. Denzel does his canon proud with another strong performance. While it's not flashy or subtle, it's exactly what the film demands. It fits.
The women are, putting it bluntly, absolutely smoking hot. Eva Mendes and Sanaa Lathan are fine actresses, and do nice work here. But in often skimpy clothes in that Miami wet heat, they could recite the phone book and most males would be entranced.
Dean Cain is terrific as ""the bad guy"". His scenes with Denzel show him stepping up to the plate admirably. You'd expect Washington to blow him off the screen...and he doesn't. At all.
The screenplay has some nice twists and turns. A veteran moviegoer will recognize or anticipate a few of them, but I guarantee there will be several scenes or lines that'll raise everyone's eyebrows. It's not perfect; there are some clunky lines sprinkled here and there.
Carl Franklin is a talented director, no question, and this simply will add to his reputation. Again, not flashy, but this story will perfectly told.
A special mention is necessary on behalf of John Billingsley. This movie will have people sitting up saying, ""who IS this guy?"" He's an absolute laugh riot. Every time he's on the screen he's hysterical. His lines have the same improvisatory feel that Bill Murray's did in ""Tootsie"" (which most were, apparently).
This is a perfect movie for adults interested in an awesome crime thriller.",1074470400,54,1753,4.846666666666667
1955909,3,B0000VJG72,"I was somewhat disappointed with this movie because it didn't take a whole alot of effort so solve this one, way before the movie ended.
Chief of Police Whitlock (Denzel) is newly separated and is having an affiar with his high school sweetheart Ann Marie.(Lathan) who is currently married to a once hasbeen pro football player(Cain)living in a sleepy florida town.
During a visit to her doctor, Whilock and Anne Marie find out that she is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Then she needs alot of money for a special treatmentdone in Europe. Now she has a million dollar policy that she signs over to Whitlock in case she dies. The night before, Whitlock make a drug bust of a half of million dollars.
Well you know what happens next. Annie Marie gets the money, but her and her husband get burnt up in a house fire and guess who's called in to solve the now double homicide case. You guessed it!  Whitlock's own wife Alex (Mendes}. Alex moved to Miami and got promoted to detective. So now with all the evidence stacking up and pointing toward Washingtion, he must now play beat the clock and get the money back and find out who killed his girlfriend and her husband.
I loved nathan's and cain's characters, because it was something different than what we are use to seeing them play. As far as Mendes' character, it would have more believeable is she would have pushed a little harder to get her man's attention. But if it was up to me I would have dropped her off at the train station. You wouldnt of missed her either way.
Washington had as much heat in this film as was needed to generate a campfire. I wanted some steamy scenes, some real passion. Sanaa Lathan is hot and exudes sexy. Make me believe it was more than a booty call between her and you! Your in hot ass Florida for God Sakes. Take your shirt off sometimes. Listen here folks! There is not one scene of Washington and Mendes romatically or sexually til the end of the film. You mean to tell me that this man don't at least compare notes mentally especaily with two women like Mendes and Lathan.
Well as far as Im concerned I will see what Denzel comes out with next. He a great actor and I think he just came back from vacation with one. Now he will get back on the ball!

Although Denzel did the best with what he was given, this film was not his best work. Not the actors fault, by any means, just pourly written. The only reson why I gave this movie three stars, was because a terrific actor like Denzel, put his name on this...stuff for lack of a better word. Also this beautiful women by the name of Eva Mendez, an up-coming rising star herself.  can't really tell you anything about he plot, or I'll give the whole thing away. Like I said before, the actor/ress did the best they could with the lousy script they were given. So, I will continue to go see their movies and cross my fingers that the rest of their movies are much better than this film. Don't give up Eva!

I was worried it would take longer for him to ""get it"", but it actually didn't and after the first 15-20 minutes the movie actually moved along fairly well and stayed pretty interesting.

This movie really didn't bring out the best in Denzel, or the supporting cast for that matter.  Let me get started on Eva Mendes, she was mediocre at best in the role she played basically because she didn't have any chemistry with Denzel.  She seemed more like his little sister than his estranged wife, and because of that, the movie was kind of ruined for me in the end when they got back together.  I think the character would have been better if someone like Angela Bassett or somebody closer to Denzel's age would have played his wife.  I've only seen Eva in this movie and 2 Fast 2 Furious and so far she hasn't really impressed me, maybe she just needs some better roles.  Dean Cain was alright in his role, he played off of Denzel pretty good in the few scenes they had together.  Sanaa Lanthan did pretty good, but I would have liked to see her be a little more manupulative and evil, but I guess I have to blame that on the script.  I thought she actually had chemistry with Denzel and were a lot more convincing than Denzel and Eva.  But what ruined it for me was when they said they were supposed to be high school sweethearts, again they were stretching it because of the obvious age difference between the two actors.
Well like I've said in the beginning it was alright, not what I expected at all.  I would only recommend this to hard core Denzel fans, but even they may be a little disappointed with this movie.",1073779200,,1703,4.307210031347962
1955929,1,B0000VJG72,A great-looking tropical setting can't save this pedestrian stinker that would have been just so-so as a tv movie. With an absurd plot and characters this one barely hobbles to a finish. Everthing thats wrong with movies today. UGH!,1073779200,,232,4.9743589743589745
1955930,3,B0000VJG72,"It is obvious that Denzel was offered a pretty decent paycheck to participate in this ""thriller"". Playing a William Hurt-like character (Think ""Body Heat""), Washington falls victim to the oldest con job in history: a ""hottie"" with an abusive husband and a terminal illness. Seems as though, Washington's police chief ""Whitlock"" would've seen this one coming a mile away.
Too many plot devices are thrown in and Washington miraculously manages to avoid what should be his fate.
Perhaps, because it is the two-time Academy Award winner assaying the role, the moviemakers decided to opt against logic and, instead, allowed the ""hero"" to escape the inevitable in this mostly forgettable film.",1073692800,,688,5.263636363636364
1955931,4,B0000VJG72,"Having Denzel Washington as the star of this 2003 film is a saving grace because for the most part the audience is way ahead of the main character in ""Out of Time.""  Washington plays Matt Lee Whitlock, the chief of police in the small town of Banyan Key, Florida, and gets himself in a situation where if the water is not over his head he has to be breathing through his eyelids.  All of the trailers I saw for this movie had emphasized the idea that Whitlock is being framed, so with that much of a heads up it is impossible not to see this freight train coming down the tracks on top of the chief.  But you can discover the details for yourself.
Once it hits the fan there are only two questions.  The first is whether Whitlock can figure everything out and do something about it before he gets nailed by homicide detective Alex Diaz Whitlock (Eva Mendes), who just happens to be the chief's estranged wife and who serves him with a divorce petition before things get really interesting.  The second has to do with the actual level of involvement in the proceedings of one key player (again, this will be obvious when you watch the movie).  Even though the set up is clear, the mystery is how Whitlock is going to get himself out of this one, assuming, of course that he will (but he is played by Denzel Washington, so are assumptions are leaning that way).  Again, I was ahead of the curve on a couple of key points, but then I have become so adept at picking up the clues screenwriters use to set things up in their films.
""Out of Time"" is one of those films where the star and his performance are enough to forgive a lot of the film's shortcomings.  This is not to say that Washington is alone in his efforts.  I liked the relationship between Whitlock and Chae (John Billingsley), the local medical examiner and resident oddball who becomes the one person the chief can trust; they have some pretty good shtick going at several points in this film.  Then there is Dean Cain, who turns in Superman's cape to play a bad guy; he and Washington have a great scene in a bar where they tell each other everything but admit nothing (compare it to the second audition scene of Cain's to see what choice bits of dialogue were added to the final version).  The end result is enjoyable enough for a one time viewing, but not a keep unless you have everything Washington has ever done all the way back to ""Carbon Copy.""",1073606400,2,2413,4.387892376681615
1955932,4,B0000VJG72,"Crisp direction by Carl Franklin and a wonderful leading man performance for Denzel put this high on the short list of best pulpy thrillers that have been made in the last ten years or so.  Everyone in the cast is strong acting wise particularly Eva Mendes who plays Denzel's ex-wife in the the film...Or is she?  Dean Cain also the delivers the goods as an abusive husband.  What really makes this film though for the predictablility that can be found in the plot (this is definitely a storyline we have seen many many times before) is how solid the suspense is...The shots, the editing, Denzel's acting, the pacing...It gets pretty nailbiting at times in the middle of the film.  This is definitely a film worth owning in my humble opinion because it is just so much fun to watch...It has a little bit of everything.  You can't say that about a lot movies.  Loses one star for the very cheesy dialogue at the very very end of the film.  But by that time the movie has already delivered everything it should have so don't let it bother or get to you as a viewer.",1073606400,,1063,4.448453608247423
1955943,4,B0000VJG72,"Nice to see Denzel Washington go low key.  OUT OF TIME is a terrific little movie for viewing at home - nice Florida Keys setting, good acting by Washington, Eva Mendes, Saana Latham, John Billingsley (especially), and Dean Cain (at long last in a bad guy role).  This little potboiler has more to say about 'coincidence', misplaced trust, moral integrity or lack thereof, and the power of relationships to endure a lot of bruising than it has substance to drive a big story.  What begins as a smalltown police chief weazling his way around another man's wife while still holding feelings for his own estranged 'new detectice' wife becomes a snappy stroll through the ins and outs of fraud, theft, lies, and murder.  A great movie it is not, bu OUT OF TIME holds its own in the current DVDs available.  And it is nice to watch Denzel Washington just do some ensemble acting.  He is very good at it!",1073520000,,898,4.58125
1955944,4,B0000VJG72,"I am a huge fan of Denzel Washington; whenever he stars in a movie I am compelled to see it.  However, I was not totally mesmerized with the plot.

1955945,3,B0000VJG72,"In the small, oceanside Florida town of Banyan Key, Police Chief Matthias Whitlock (Denzel Washington) has gained notoriety from a big drug bust, but a recent separation from his wife has dampened his spirits. So Whitlock has an affair with an old school friend, Anne-Merai (Sanaa Lathan), who is now married to an abusive former pro athlete (Dean Cain). But his attempts to help Anne-Merai turn to disaster when it appears that she has been murdered and Whitlock's estranged wife Alex (Eva Mendes), now a homicide detective, is assigned to the case.

""Out of Time"" is director Carl Franklin's latest foray into the quasi-noir genre. His earlier noirs include 1995's ""Devil in a Blue Dress"", which also starred Denzel Washington, and 2002's tepid ""High Crimes"". ""Out of Time"" is good-looking and reasonably entertaining, but too predictable to be anything more. It has a rehashed noir plot. And the story's conclusion becomes obvious as soon as the murder has been committed. Every twist and turn the film takes is immediately recognizable, because it borrows so much from so many noirs, going all the way back to 1944's ""Double Indemnity"". Like ""Devil in a Blue Dress"", this film's plot elements resemble the pre-1958 noirs more than those of neo-noirs. Unlike ""Devil in a Blue Dress"", ""Out of Time"" doesn't have brilliant cinematography, political intrigue, or period allure...or Don Cheadle. And our protagonist, Police Chief Whitlock, does stupid things. Thrillers are always more effective and intriguing when the hero plays it smart. What ""Out of Time"" does have to admire is a very effective middle act. The scenes in which Whitlock senses that he will be blamed for the murder and tries to conceal his involvement with Anne-Merai create real tension. There's a great scene in the police station in which Whitlock frantically attempts to hide his cell phone activity. And Denzel Washington effectively conveys his character's panic when he realizes what has actually happened and how much trouble he is in. So this isn't a bad film. There's just nothing special and certainly nothing original about it. It has an attractive cast and locations. And it has a few edge-of-your-seat moments. Recommended as a rental.

The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by director Carl Franklin, a ""making of"" documentary with interviews, character profiles, 2 outtakes, screen tests for Sanaa Lathan and Dean Cain, an image gallery, and a theatrical trailer. The audio commentary  is decent although Franklin gets off topic sometimes, and I wish he had included more about the film's production design. The ""making of"" documentary is average, and I would skip the rest of the extras if you are not a hard-core fan. Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French. Unfortunately, there are some unavoidable previews before the main menu.",1073520000,,2893,5.151063829787234
1955946,5,B0000VJG72,"Denzel Washington, for one more time, shone like a bright star in a cloudless night. This movie, from the beginning to the end, keeps you at the edge of your seat primarily for two reasons: first, the movie is jam packed with captivating/unforgettable scenes and, secondly, the originality of the story leaves you little or no room at all to predict the next outcome---making you, thus, so much absorbed.
""Out of Time"" definitely is worth both your time and dime.",1073433600,2,463,4.8

The plot is alright even if I guess easily what it will happen next. It's quite predictable and I found it was close to ""NO WAY OUT"" released longtime ago (1987) with Costner and Hackman for those who remember this flick.

1955949,4,B0000VJG72,"I have always thought very highly of Denzel Washington as an actor.  His Oscar-winning roles in ""Glory"" and ""Training Day"" are quite compelling.  Some of his roles where he failed to win an Oscar (or even be nominated), such as ""Malcolm X"", ""Courage Under Fire"", and ""The Hurricane"" are even more impressive.  Yet, though there are many actors who, given good material, can perform quite well, the true mark of a great actor is their ability to elevate a bad material and lousy script and make it a totally watchable movie.  Denzel is just such an actor.  As many times in his career as he has delivered tour-de-force performances in excellent movies, he has also managed to make a number of poor films enjoyable.  Some of the turkeys he has been a part of include ""Ricochet"", ""Virtuosity"", ""The Preacher's Wife"", and this 2003 entry ""Out of Time"".  In each case, these films contain laughable characters, wildly over-the-top plot twists, and poor dialogue.  Yet, Washington manages to elevate these films (he did have an assist from Russell Crowe in ""Virtuosity"") to a level of campy, popcorn fun.

Denzel's latest, ""Out of Time"", would be an utter failure in the hands of a lesser actor.  The generic title and wildly implausible script could easily assign this to most critics' and moviegoers' non-descript pile.  Yet, the presence of Denzel Washington makes this film very enjoyable and allows the audience to overlook flaws in the film.

The film takes place in a sleepy Florida town where Matt Lee Whitlock (Denzel Washington) serves as its police chief.  Aside from a very notable drug bust that he was involved in, the only other drama in Whitlock's life comes in the form of his impending divorce from his wife Alex (the sexy Eva Mendes), a federal agent, and his affair with the wife, Anne Marie Harrison, (Sanaa Lathan) of a former NFL quarterback and current wife-beater, Chris Harrison (Dean Cain in a sleazy turn that will stun the fans of ""Lois and Clark"").  While Matt laments the ending of his marriage, he seems to be pleasurably distracted by his involvement with Anne Marie until she tells him that she has cancer and may only have a few months to live.  She needs a radical medical procedure involved in Europe, but doesn't have the money to pay for this expensive procedure.  Matt, in a moment of emotional weakness decides to pull the evidence money from the drug bust from his safe and give it to her to pay for the procedure.  Of course, not long after he does that, the Harrison's house goes up in flames as a result of arson and both Anne Marie and Chris are presumed dead.  Now, with the money gone and feds unexpectedly breathing down his neck for that evidence, Matt's soon-to-be ex, Alex, returns to town to investigate the arson.  Realizing that almost all of the evidence points to him, Matt begins a panicky race against time to find out what really happened while covering the clues that could indict him.

""Out of Time"" has quite a bit working for it.  The South Florida atmosphere, very attractive female leads, and white-knuckle tension give this film a lot in its favor.  It should be mentioned that Matt's sidekick, medical examiner Chae (played by John Billingsley of ""Star Trek: Enterprise""), provides wonderful comic relief to prevent this film from overdosing on the tension.  Of course, the implausible scam concocted to defraud Matt of the evidence, the ludicrous plot twists at the end, and dialogue that is slightly less than Shakespearean are strikes against the film.  As alluded to before, had this been in the hands of a lesser actor, this movie would not have been worth seeing.  Fortunately, Denzel once again rides to the rescue of a film and, in this case, elevates it to a four-star thriller.",1070928000,,3749,4.78416149068323
1955950,3,B0000VJG72,"I've read several reviews of this movie, and they all fail to mention the most important fact--that Dean Cain is absolutely to-die-for (no pun intended) in this so-so movie. I never liked him that much before, but he does wonders for a goatee here. I practically lived for his few blessed minutes of screen time.
Why isn't this gorgeous, talented actor in more movies as opposed to actors like Vin Diesel, who have no talent and are not even good-looking? You've got me.
That said, the movie is all right, with the Florida flavor adding much to the plot. Eva Mendes is gorgeous as always, and Denzel is okay, too. Sanaa Lathan is very good (and also, very much up to the demands of her role), but the movie may seem predictable to some, highly implausible to others. Nevertheless, it's full of twists and turns, good looking actors, and all that Florida scenery. Really, for a ""new"" film noir, it's pretty darn good.
Please watch this movie, if only for the very sexy and highly underrated DEAN CAIN.",1070582400,3,1000,4.623595505617978
1955951,4,B0000VJG72,"OUT OF TIME illustrates a predicament familiar to most men, i.e. when good sense is subverted by the promise of genital happiness with a pretty woman.
Denzel Washington is Matt Whitlock, Sheriff of Banyon Key, FL. His wife Alexandra (Eva Mendes), a Miami homicide gumshoe, has moved out and is getting the divorce papers processed. In the meantime, the sheriff finds solace in the bed of Ann (Sanaa Lathan), the abused wife of jealous Chris (Dean Cain), a local morgue security guard. Paradise begins to unravel when Ann reveals that she has terminal cancer and six months to live. After an unsuccessful attempt to convert a million dollar life insurance policy into the cash needed to fund experimental cancer treatment in Switzerland, Ann makes Matt the beneficiary, and the latter ""loans"" her five-hundred grand in impounded drug money, evidence in a stalled criminal investigation, that's currently on ice in the sheriff's safe. The night after Ann takes possession of the swag, she and her husband are apparently murdered in their home, which is then torched. Alexandra is assigned to the case. Meanwhile, the cash has disappeared; Matt is identified by a non-reliable witness as the suspicious person skulking outside his paramour's home the night of the crime; and the local DEA chief has phoned to say that he's sending two of his heavies over to take possession of the drug money. Fancy dancing is in order if Matt is to stay out of Deep Bandini.
The plot becomes more incredible with a compressed time frame that demands that Matt extricate himself from his mess over two 8-hour work shifts. Alexandra doesn't even have the time to change out of a gloriously short and tight miniskirt and high heels, in which outfit she manages to kick down a locked door. (At that point, my wife leaned over to whisper, ""Do you know what would happen if one really tried that?"" Perhaps she has a secret life I don't know about?)
This isn't Washington's most memorable performance. But, since Denzel is one of Hollywood's most appealing actors, who cares? Matt spends the entire latter half of the film looking like a deer mesmerized by approaching highbeams while teetering on the edge of an abyss. Alexandra is constantly giving him that hard look familiar to guilty husbands everywhere that implies the question, ""Is there something you want to tell me?"" The Final Confrontation, which takes place in the familiar milieux of rain, darkness, and a creepy abandoned structure, does benefit from a satisfying plot twist.
