8441042,5,B00075K82S,"I bought this DVD for my children and then found that my husband and I couldn't stop watching it with them!  The Captain Jon series does a phenomenal job of talking to the kids and not down to them.  It is created for all ages.  His DVD's grab every ones attention with how much fun they all have during their adventure, and when the show is over we realized how much we have learned while enjoying the entertainment.  This shark DVD is the best yet!  And we are all looking forward to many more Captain Jon adventures!",1107129600,4,519,4.309278350515464
