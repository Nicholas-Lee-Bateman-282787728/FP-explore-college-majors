8144926,4,B000ICLRDE,"This documentary provides a 50 minute overview of Napoleon's military history. It touches on a few other periods such as his Egyptian campaign, but the emphasis is on the big three Austerlitz, Russian campaign and Waterloo. The battle reenactments provide atmosphere for those interested in the Napoleonic era. Of course, you'll want to get more programs on the topic but it's not a bad place to start.",1517011200,,402,5.014925373134329

8144930,1,B000ICLRDE,"I returned this DVD.  I was disappointed that they made such poor use of David Chandler, who in his books explains things brilliantly.  How can you talk about Napoleon by leaving out Jena and Auerstadt in 1806, the Friedland campaign of 1807, how Spain caused the erosion of his armies, the 1809 campaign against Austria, and Germany in 1813?  And it was boring, poor use of maps, no use of diagrams like the ones Chandler sued in ""Campaigns of Napoleon"", and completely missed the brilliance of Austerlitz and the Ulm campaign.  I could have made a much better movie using my toy soldiers.",1370563200,6,590,4.699029126213592
