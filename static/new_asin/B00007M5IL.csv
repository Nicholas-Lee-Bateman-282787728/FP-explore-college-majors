7978477,5,B00007M5IL,"The edition of this film i saw was part of a pack of family films, 8 in all, bought from walmart for 5 dollars. I was pleasantly surprised by the film. I had never heard of the Whites, in spite of the fact I like Teddy Roosevelt. I certainly had never heard of this film. But my eyes were presented with a jewel of unprecedented and inspiring beauty. This is the story of a young Girl and her father who, just by being themselves, set out to change the world. And mybe, just maybe, they did. This is a quality film, they litteraly do not make them like this any more, but maybe they should. It takes the unusual point of view of having W.A. White- the Dad- Talk directly to the camera in a confessional style, sort of reminiscent of reality tv, but better. As if you the viewer are actually in the town as a visitor in his life. this is normally only done in travel logs, not biogrophys. So he is not just a voiceover, he is telling you the story straight up.
And the camera does not flinch at the death. The fact it starts that way, while removing the shock, allows the viewer the strength to not worry about that scene till almost the end, so that this becomes about her life, not her death. And what a life. And the actors are all top notch, giving the kind of performances that remind you of frank capera, without feeling dated. which is ironic for a a story about the 1920s filmed in the late 1970s. It feels sort of timeless. That is such an overused word, but for this film, it is almost literally true. After watching the film, I then was inspired to look up more info online about the story. Loved this movie. Wow.",1362268800,7,1623,4.221864951768489
7978478,5,B00007M5IL,"I would recommend the ""mary white' movie to anyone who wants to know about one of the great journalistic essays ever written.

William Allen White, the legendary journalist from Kansas, lost his daughter when she was just 16. His essay about her death remains one of the top newspaper columns ever written.",1337385600,5,306,4.884615384615385
7978479,4,B00007M5IL,"This was one of my favorites from high school, a good, true story about a high school girl who made a real difference in her all-too-brief lifetime. Glad to see it's available on DVD!",1305244800,2,183,4.411764705882353
7978480,5,B00007M5IL,"William Allen White was a well-known Kansas editor and author in the early years of the 20th century.  His daughter, Mary, was killed in a horse-riding accident in 1921, shortly before her 17th birthday.  Most of White's writings have faded into obscurity, but his editorial about Mary lives on.  Mary never hesitated to speak up against social and racial injustice.  She wanted to be known as a person in her own right, not as the daughter of a famous man.

The movie depicts the last year of Mary's life.  Certain facts were changed -- Mary was a high school junior at the time of her death, not a senior -- but her essential story remains the same.  She reached out to those less fortunate, often ignoring the social rules of her time.  Her impulsiveness caused trouble at school and home, but her father stood behind her.  Mary's mother felt it was time for her to grow up, and they frequently clashed.  But the overall picture is of a nurturing, loving family.

The movie was filmed on location in Emporia, Kansas.  The actual White home, ""Red Rocks,"" is featured.  An interesting fact is that at the time of Mary's death, the Whites were living elsewhere in town.  A fire earlier that year destroyed Red Rock's upper story.  The Whites had already planned a major renovation of the house.  After Mary's death, her mother insisted that the restoration of Mary's bedroom go on as planned.  Before and after pictures of Red Rocks show the house as it was when Mary lived there.  It is now open to the public.

Look closely, and you can spot a window air conditioner in the scene where Mary drives to school.

This movie is suitable for all ages, and may spark interest in learning more about the lives of Mary and her family.  Mary now has her own Facebook page, featuring several previously-unpublished photos.",1286323200,8,1814,4.6415094339622645
7978481,3,B00007M5IL,"The famous award winning small town Midwest newspaper
publisher and author loses his daughter in a riding accident
when she hits her head on a tree while riding her horse
after waving at a boy who was sweet on her.
The whole piece seems to be about how difficult and idealistic
this teen age girl was who was just about to graduate from high school.
She breaks her arm cranking her model T Ford
and that sets off a chain of parental disciplines.
For the most part with excellent grades and very good
behavior, she is a model daughter who is head strong
and at her Dad's teaching, very idealistic about
discrimination, the elderly, unions and human rights in
general. The time period is the active one of post world war
one when horses still were used on a great many roads and farms in the Midwest.
I liked the movie, but it was kind of sentimental.",1256688000,3,849,4.414012738853503
