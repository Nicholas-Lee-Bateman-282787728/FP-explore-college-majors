7421989,1,B014TE5DKO,"The first movie part 1 was much much better. This started good,  but then the stories fell apart and were very, very lousy. To me this feels like it was made in a week lol, honest guys the stories don't make much sense at all. The wrap around story in this is a dud.... The killer in the wrap around is NOT scary at all, like the clown in the first one.  Very disappointing movie.

I can honestly say I enjoyed 2 of the shorts in it. The others had nothing at all to do with Halloween ( which is ok ) but they just sucked.  It honestly felt like a rushed made in a week lousy movie.  As I have said before on things don't believe me ? rent it and I think you will agree lol.",1444176000,3,674,3.8550724637681157
7421990,3,B014TE5DKO,"This was another Halloween anthology, a sequel to All Hallows Eve .It starts out with a woman finding a strange VHS tape on her doorstep, then she pops it in the VCR and starts watching.! There are about 6 or 7 short films but there were really only 3 that were memorable and the rest were average to underwhelming at best!

There wasn't much gore and few effects. The last short had a very creepy feel to it and the makeup was well done. It was in Spanish with English subtitles. The overall offering isn't bad but not good either. It had promise but fell short. They skimped on the gore and effects. There was oppurtunity for some good splatter and  other gore but they went the easy route. The first story dealing with pumpkin seeds was the best and had the only really decent gore effect.

That could have definatley brought the movie up a couple of stars. If the stories had been better executed and been more suspensful,they might have been able to get away with it. I did however enjoy the musical score and found it creepy and fitting.

The pumpkin face man that delivers the tape and lurks outside the main characters house is sort of creepy in a couple of shots but once you see him full on in a more lighted setting he's not at all disturbing. I liked what there intentions were but I would really only recommend it for a Redbox rental or if you had no other Halloween films to choose from.",1444089600,,1401,4.35632183908046

7421992,2,B014TE5DKO,"The only short I liked in this was the last one. Nowhere near as good as the first All Hallow's Eve. Waste of time if you ask me.

7421997,3,B014TE5DKO,Not as good as the 1st All Hallows' Eve movie.,1454284800,,46,3.7
7421998,2,B014TE5DKO,"The first All Hallows Eve was a pretty decent movie, I particularly liked it because it followed throughout its various short tales a main antagonist, as well as brought this antagonist into the background story. This on the other hand, is really just a mashup of some unique horror short films, where they try to bring the antagonist on the front cover into the over all background tale the same way, but, without having him/her appear in some way in all the stories throughout. They fail at it, Worth a watch if you just want something simple, easy and unique. But isn't as good as the first.
If you haven't seen the first, then I would suggest you watch that movie instead of this one, if you didn't like the first, then I would say skip this one.",1449619200,,750,4.442028985507246

7422013,4,B014TE5DKO,"This movie was even better than the first, in my opinion. The production values, direction, music, sound effects, all were a higher notch up.  There was one at the end that really creeped me out.  These are professionally done shorts, by independent companies.  The credits are 8 or 9 minutes long, just to list all them, as here are close to 10 shorts or maybe more. There were enough connected to Halloween to make it a seasonal regular.",1446768000,,439,4.602564102564102

7422016,1,B014TE5DKO,"As a horror fan, it hurts me to see a good and effective film like All Hallows Eve followed up with a truly lame sequel like this one.  The anthology of stories in the first film were all linked together by the character of Art the Clown, a bad guy who was tailor-made for Halloween.  All Hallows Eve 2 is just a lame excuse to string together a bunch of forgettable short films that were about as frightening as wet noodles.  So, yeah, in both movies, someone gets an unlabeled VHS tape on Halloween night and decides to watch it, but thats where the similarities end.  In the first movie, the stories on the tape looked as if they could be real, but theres no mistaking the artificiality of the dull entries on this second movies tape.  Where the first movies stories all featured Art the Clown and basically brought Art to life, none of the stories in the sequel have anything to do with the pumpkin-faced weirdo who leaves the tape at the doorstep of the designated viewer.  Theres no buildup to anything, just a totally predictable ending that lacks any intensity or interest.

I won't go in to any of the boring details of the eight short films included in this anthology because none of them are worth the effort.  With each one coming from a different director, its little surprise that the film as a whole has no continuity.  Frankly, I expect I would get more enjoyment out of watching eight random fan-made horror shorts on YouTube.  Even Art the Clown could have done little to save this sequel  but he darn well should have had the chance.  Dropping his character entirely from the sequel makes absolutely no sense to me.  Seriously, All Hallows Eve 2 is one of the most disappointing horror sequels I have ever seen.",1445990400,4,1730,4.52411575562701
7422017,2,B014TE5DKO,This sequel was terrible! The first one was so much better. They should have made a sequel with that killer clown from the first. The beginning was good with the pumpkin seeds scene and then after that it was down hill and boring from there. Stick with the original,1445558400,2,265,4.428571428571429
7422018,3,B014TE5DKO,"This is another anthology with the shortest segment running about 4 minutes. The first two segments (second one was my favorite) deal with Halloween while the rest do not. I found 2-3 segments enjoyable and the rest was meh. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of the film was the woman had a working VCR attached to her TV set and not in a closet.

I have never seen a pumpkin carved that easy, quickly, and precise with a large knife.

7422019,4,B014TE5DKO,Good halloween fun! Play this one and the first one back to back all Halloween night!,1445472000,,85,4.375
7422020,2,B014TE5DKO,"Dire collection of (mostly) Halloween themed horror shorts is basically a poor man's v/h/s, with no name directors and virtually nothing to recommend it beyond a basic level of competence than anyone with enough money can purchase.  What's missing isn't production values but inspiration, imagination and basic storytelling skill.

The opening segment Jack Attack appropriates a special effect from The Thing without coming up with an actual story to go with it.  The special effect look good but the segment couldn't possibly be more pointless.  The Last Halloween shows some children trick-or-treating through the worst neighborhood in America and features an admittedly cool final shot, but getting there isn't much fun.  Mr. Tricker's Treat features a pretty cool idea--a serial killer disguises his victims as Halloween decorations around the outside of his house--but comes up with no narrative of any kind to support it.  The Offering about a father and son driving out into the woods to leave an offering for...something...barely even qualifies as a concept.  Descent where a women witnesses her friend murdered by a serial killer while hiding in a closet might have worked if it had been fleshed out better but it ends up being pretty lame.  A Boy's Life doesn't even feel like it was meant to be a horror story and adds an incongruous final shot to allow its inclusion here.  The segment actually works well otherwise--just not as a horror story.  The Spanish or Portuguese language Alexia (the two sound the same to me) about a man haunted on his computer by a dead girlfriend manages some creepy bits but rips off most of its effects from the tired tropes of J-horror.  Only the short and sharp M is for Masochist (was this a reject from ABC's of Horror?) is an unqualified success.  The story of a carnival attraction where some boys pick painful looking objects to throw at a gagged and partially masked ""masochist"" tied to a spinning wheel has a nifty twist and packs a nasty but amusing punch.

Even the better horror anthology films like the ABC's of Death and v/h/s series (which throw in some bigger name directors to go with the complete unknowns) are uneven but All Hallow's Eve 2 is pretty much bottom of the barrel despite its consistently slick production values.  If your expectations are low enough you might like this more than I did.",1444780800,2,2361,4.899497487437186

8731790,1,B014TE5DKO,"I'm a horror fanatic and when you watch as much of the genre as I have you come to expect very little to suprise you. Once in a while however, you stumble across a gem. This was exactly the case with the first All Hallows' Eve! First, I couldn't believe I'd found a film I had not already seen. From the moment I began watching the first film I was thrilled. For an obvious micro-budget production, it was extremely well done. The story line was fresh, the costuming was spectacular...and that clown!! OH MY GOD THAT CLOWN!! The clown was a stroke of brilliance. The first All Hallows' Eve was an absolute joy to watch! Naturally, I was so excited to see what this amazing team was going to bring to their 2nd film and imagine my disappointment after watching All Hallows' Eve 2. I tried to give this movie benefit of the doubt and figured that perhaps they were not aiming to actually follow the DNA of the first film...but then why associate with the title? I can also understand why they may not have wanted to carry the clown to the 2nd film as well, but they didn't even try to tie all the shorts together that were on the VHS. What became clear to me after the disappointing and frustrating end of All Hallows' Eve 2 was that the filmmakers probably didn't even have any vision at all for the follow up. The movie made no sense, it was so disjointed that several times I actually forgot what I was watching and sadly...the film was more comical than scary.",1479340800,4,1462,4.3786764705882355
