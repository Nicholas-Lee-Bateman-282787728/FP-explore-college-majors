Some good points and views but our desire to just see anything Hawaii turned into laughing at the ""hostess"" and presentation. Did they really use a green screen??",1436486400,,308,4.722222222222222

8205286,4,B000SGHSTW,"OAHU HAWAII is a very good DVD focusing on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, and to some extent all of Hawaii. It's nicely put together, with great photography (although at 1.33:1), attractive graphics, and hosted by the gracious native Hawaiian Maria Quiban. One of the strongest parts of the DVD is the ""History and Culture"" section, which runs about 30 minutes. It gives a good summary of the history of all of Hawaii, and is done with good photos and paintings as well as appropriate interview clips from museum curators and the like. Several historic museums and sites are visited, including the Bishop Museum and the Polynesian Cultural Center.

The next 2 sections of the DVD are ""Fun in the Hawaiian Sun"" and ""Wild Side of Oahu."" These 2 sections run about 35 minutes total, and they cover fun stuff to do in Oahu including many beaches, surfing, boating, parasailing, skydiving, restaurants, nightclubs, shopping, and more. All this does give you a good idea of the many things to do in Oahu, but so much is covered that these sections have quite a rushed feel. This is exacerbated by the sometimes jittery, rapidly changing photography and rock soundtrack. Thus, these sections don't give a sense of relaxation, but for people going to Hawaii for excitement this style is appropriate.

However, the last 2 sections, ""Things You Have To Do"" and ""Things You Have To See"" return to a more sedate feel, although again a lot is covered in about 23 minutes so there's not a lot of time for each place. Included here are the Dole Plantation, Honolulu Zoo, Waikiki Aquarium, Sea Life Park, Atlantis Submarines and other water adventures, Waimea Valley Audubon Center, Paradise Cove Luau, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Koolau Mountain Range, Honolulu Harbor, and more. These sections have a pleasant guitar background much of the time. One great aspect of the DVD is that there many interview clips of people connected with each location, not only in these 2 sections but on the entire DVD.

In sum, OAHU HAWAII is a very nicely made DVD and I recommend it. I do think the DVD would be a bit better if it ran perhaps 30 minutes longer so it did not have a rushed feel at times.",1407715200,,2168,4.73015873015873
8205287,5,B000SGHSTW,"Excellent DVD! It shows you nearly all of the Islands main attractions. Also, some of the lesser known attractions. For the price, it was a great value. Having been to the Island several times I brought the DVD to show friends. I'm always taking photos so the DVD was nice to fall back on. The memories of Oahu will last a lifetime with this DVD... Go ahead and make the purchase. You won't be disappointed.  Aloha!",1264550400,5,415,4.4605263157894735

8205289,4,B000SGHSTW,This is very well done.  It gives you a glimpse of Hawaiian culture and what to do when you get there.  Even if you can't get to Oahu it's an enjoyable dvd.  Some lovely photography.,1254873600,3,182,4.142857142857143
