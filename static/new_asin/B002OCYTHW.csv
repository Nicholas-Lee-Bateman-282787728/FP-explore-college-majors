8637022,5,B002OCYTHW,"This was/is the most interesting Australian series I have ever seen.  I own several (including Series 1) and have seen many more while spending time in Australia.  It was well written, contemporary (ok, 2001-2002)  the characters were believable and realistic. The acting was excellent...on all counts and the subject matter was well chosen.  Why in the world did it only last two seasons?..if anyone knows, please let the rest of us know.  And... why do Australian TV series only last 8 to 10 episodes a season while American TV series last 20 to 30 episodes, if successful.?",1309910400,,576,4.896907216494846
