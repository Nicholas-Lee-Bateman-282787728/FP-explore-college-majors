8028505,4,B0002KQNM2,"There is a lot published and produced about D Day and I liked this DVD, produced by BBC in 2002, because it includes present-day (well 2000-2002) reminisces on the British incursion on Sword Beach several hours before the landings on a mission to take out German weapons, Merville Battery, aimed to fire-upon an invasion from the ocean to the coast. The whole 90-minutes was well produced. It was not jarring for me to see present time faces talking about their actions that day, reenactments and actual footage.
The special features were especially good:
 4 Behind the Scenes featurettes of about 4 to 6 minutes each were: Remembering D Day; Telling the Story; Boot Camp; and Photographing Tragedies-Robert Capa.
 Eyewitness accounts  there were 8 or so segments, 2 to 6 minutes long, of the survivors telling what they saw and putting it into context. The German soldier and the French resistance member were in their native language with subtitles. The English speakers had Captions to aid in understanding what they said.
 Fact files were 16 separate static sets of screens giving several pages of printed bio on 16 participants from the several countries and services. I usually skip those, but I did read quite a few of these.
 Original Score has 16 segments of the background music composed for the various segments.
 Photo Gallery had dozens of photos from the production of the film. 00
It was color and some B&W original footage, had CC and a useful set of screens to navigate the disks contents. A good purchase of a used DVD for me.",1499990400,,1544,4.829545454545454

8028507,5,B0002KQNM2,"The BBC did a nice job with this 90-minute program about D-Day, interspersing eye-witness interviews with realistic recreations and actual footage.  The story is told from the points-of-view of German, British, American and French participants, and is done fairly seamlessly.  As someone who's done a bit of study about D-Day, I found much of the information to be common knowledge; however, the presentation was well-done and the historical reenactments were believable.  The DVD is cinematic in its approach, with great color and attention to details, and most was obviously shot on location.  If you are looking for a short overview, this one fits the bill nicely.  It would be a good introduction for anyone interested in learning more about D-Day.
