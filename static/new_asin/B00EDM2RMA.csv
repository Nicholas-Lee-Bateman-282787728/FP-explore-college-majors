5904454,1,B00EDM2RMA,"Bad...just bad. A teenager's version of Groundhog Day. I had high hopes because we love Bailee Madison and Zachary Gordon. Thought this would be a great family Christmas movie to add to our collection. Right off the bat, the magic of Santa is ruined. Beware, if hoping to watch with young children like I did. My little ones didn't ""get"" it, and it seemed to go right over my 8 year olds head (hopefully) I threw the dvd in the trash. Not happy with Santa being ruined in what seems to be like a movie geared for families. That, and the fact that the movie was just dumb and boring. Just to give you an idea...the parents are arguing because they both forgot to get their son Santa gifts, so the boy gets no gifts. Sad and depressing. Then, we get to watch the scene play out, over and over. Skip this one, it's THAT bad.",1386115200,2,821,4.269230769230769

5904458,1,B00EDM2RMA,"Not a must see...

If you are looking for a christmas movie that has a real story line... this is not it. This movie is the teenage christmas version of the movie groundhound day. I withheld judgement until after the first hour of the movie and waited... the second hour was not any better, just continuing the same story line of a teenager reliving Christmas day over and yes over again. To make a long story short do not waste your money on a holiday movie  that is not worth viewing. Stick with the basic classics like, a christmas carol, a christmas story, home alone, or the family stone.

I hate to be a scrooge, but hallmark missed the mark on this monstrosity of a movie.",1383868800,2,679,4.373015873015873

5904463,4,B00EDM2RMA,"It is good, and to call it a Groundhog Day knockoff is wrong. This theme was used before Groundhog Day. I liked the movie except for one big thing. He repeats the day way too many times. He must have spent a whole month repeating it. You find yourself a quarter of the way in the movie saying, does he get it right yet? Aside from that it's good, would be five stars if it weren't for that. Not one I would watch every year but worth seeing once .",1450656000,,447,3.977777777777778

Zach Gordon is engaging and fun to watch.  One of the best parts is when he and his grandpa (Bruce Dern) have a very heartfelt exchange in an ice cream parlor.  Very touching and great acting.

Teen-angst co-star ,~*~, Bailee Madison is the new nextdoor neighbor from Wisconsin. Also stars Bruce Dern
(a favorite of mine since the '60s.) Times have changed, now that I am in MY sixties, things are starting to un-
ravel... like a very old comfortable sweater... I remember the best of times... and forgive short-comings.
I enjoyed this mish-mash of 12:01/Ground Hog Day, in fact, I was hoping for a kiss-exchange between Zachary
and Bailee's characters. Perhaps their ages made it inappropriate. Ms Madison and Master Gordon are older than
their years.
I'll leave a footnote about their most-recent endeavors on film:

5904484,4,B00EDM2RMA,"I felt like I had seen this movie before. Oh wait it was an old abc family movie from the 90s titled ""Christmas every day"" which is essentially the same movie with a slightly different subplot. All in all it was a cute and enjoyable movie.",1417996800,,239,4.217391304347826
5904485,5,B00EDM2RMA,Great family movie!,1417737600,,19,5.666666666666667
5904486,5,B00EDM2RMA,"As ""modern"" Christmas movies go, this one is fun and semi-classic. Yes the concept of reliving days has been done before but it's presented in a fairly unique situation in this movie. And it's from the perspective of a young man with siblings, which presents it's own twists. Worth watching and fun for the kids as well.",1417478400,,320,4.631578947368421
5904487,4,B00EDM2RMA,"As others have pointed out, this film is essentially ""Groundhog Day"" set at Christmas with a younger protagonist. That's not a revelation. Anyone who has seen both films will catch the clear references to ""Groundhog Day"" in this film. And if I were rating this film based only on originality, it would get a very low score indeed. But the target audience for this probably will not have seen ""Groundhog Day,"" and even so, the idea of repeating time is was not necessarily invented for ""Groundhog Day."" (See, for example, ""12:01,"" which was a television movie released in the same year as ""Groundhog Day."")

The premise is simple. Pete's Christmas does not go well. His parents forget to get him a gift, his brother blames him for things he didn't do, and his grandfather visits only to feel slighted and leave. Oh, well. Not every Christmas can be good. When Pete awakens the next day, it's Christmas yet again. And again. And again, and so forth. And as we go through probably hundreds of Christmases, Pete learns and one by one tries to right the wrongs of the first Christmas. In doing so, he learns a fair amount. I'll give an example that won't ruin much of the film, but it's a bit of a spoiler, so skip the next paragraph if you'd rather not have any more of the plot revealed.

As part of Christmas day, Pete and his brother play in a football game against the neighbors. At first, the neighbors win, as, it seems, they always do. But given the chance to relive the same day repeatedly, Pete realizes that he can win the game since he knows what the other team will do. And so he does--only to find out that his brother, the football star, is not satisfied. So Pete finds another way to win the game, this time addressing his brother's concerns. (Oh, and the solution seems silly and contrived.)

Certainly not the greatest film ever made, ""Pete's Christmas"" does have a certain charm and does seem to have its heart in the right place. And Bruce Dern as the cranky grandfather is lots of fun.",1416787200,2,2001,4.5220994475138125

8604220,4,B00EDM2RMA,"I really didn't like this movie at first.  The kids were mean to each other and no one was really very pleasant.  But as the days progressed, the main character discovered that he could change AND make a difference in his own life.  He realized that he liked his family and most of the things that they did for Christmas and other days of the year.  Bruce Dern turned in another stellar performance, playing the crotchety grandfather who turns out to be better than he seems.  By the end of the movie, I was enjoying it quite a bit.  It did take a lot of story line from a movie that came out several years ago called (if I remember correctly) Christmas Every Day, but they put a different spin on it, so it didn't make that much difference.  It's a nice family movie to watch.  Probably won't be a family favorite (but it might be) but it will be enjoyed.",1483574400,,856,4.273291925465839
