A b-western is a lower budget movie that concentrates more on action and stars usually actors you don't see on main stream movies but they are there to keep these movies going with fast action,horse riding thrills and there is always that good looking herino that the hero has to rescue. This dvd has 2 exciting features from that lost era of movie going,I recommend Riders of the Whistling Skull from 1936,good story and action,print is very watchable for it's age. Tex Ritter is in the other,Tex is a action star singing cowboy and just for nostalgia he's Three's Comapny lead actor John Ritter's father. Give this dvd set a shot,if you like classic b-westerns this is you best bet",1367020800,,851,4.635761589403973
