4561492,3,B0054602XU,"This is a documentary about Herschell Gordon Lewis, who has been dubbed ""The Godfather of Gore"". He directed such films as Blood Feast, 2000 Maniacs, and Wizard of Gore. This is a pretty interesting documentary, showing many clips of his old movies, and even some that he didn't direct. There is a good bit of nudity in the some of the clips. I was disappointed however that there no talk of Blood Feast 2: All You Can Eat, which is my favorite H.G. Lewis film. This doc is still worth watching for his fans, though.",1330041600,4,516,4.442105263157894

Godfather of Gore: The Herschell Gordon Lewis Documentary (2011), proves to be a vivid colour transfer from film stock to DVD format, as today's HD TV display buyers demand.  Joe Bob Briggs (the actor John Bloom) never looked better.  This DVD is so brilliant in colours, whilst being deeply learned yet pellucid with commentary, I expect this film to run as an IFC evergreen, with that intellectual TV network's own productions such as Indie Sex.

I award Godfather of Gore 11.5 stars out of 5, the 11.5 being, coincidentally, the alcohol content of those cheap CA ""Champagnes,"" a fitting toast to GoG.

Salud.

4561497,5,B0054602XU,"A friend and I were lucky enough to see this on the big screen in NYC last Spring, and we both loved it. A funny, illuminating, and overdue love-letter to the Godfather Of Gore, the film delves deeply into Lewis' career (if not his personal life) and we follow it's trajectory film by film. Narration and interview clips with Lewis, producing-partner David F. Friedman, cult auteur Frank Henenlotter, and Trash reviewer Joe Bob Briggs keep the viewer in the loop - providing context, and lots of laughs. Fans of Cult/Trash/Horror/Exploitation cinema need to have this dvd nestled between their copies of 'Blood Feast' and 'Color Me Blood Red', as it serves to provide much-needed backround info on one of our unsung horror-heroes, and works as an unusually entertaining shlockumentary.",1309046400,13,785,5.093023255813954
8456353,5,B0054602XU,"Herschell Gordon Lewis, for those who may not be familiar, made his mark mainly in the 1960's and 70's and is most known for his films 'Blood Feast' and '2000 Maniacs' which are known as the first ""gore"" movies

This film is a documentary of his career starting in his pre-Blood Feast days when he mainly did films known as ""nudie cuties"" which were films with lots of nudity, no sex, and very little story-lines.

When that genre had run its course, Herschell and his business partner David Friedman brainstormed on what types of films they could do next that movie houses at the time would show and customers would still pay to see.  Shortly after 'Blood Feast' was born.

Shot for just under $25,000, 'Blood Feast' became a Drive-in movie sensation at the time and a new genre of films were brought to life.
This documentary spends a great deal discussing his early days and his most known films, the Blood Trilogy - 'Blood Feast',  '2000 Maniacs' and 'Color Me Blood Red' and finishes off with his last film of the 70's 'The Gore Gore Girls'.

Most of his other films from that time period are also discussed, 'Wizard of Gore', 'The Gruesome Twosome', 'Something Weird' and 'A Taste of Blood' to name a few.

I would consider myself a big fan of Herschell's, as well as documentary director Frank Henenlotter's. This documentary is a must see for an enthusiast of his films.

Interviews with Mr Lewis himself, David Friedman, Joe Bob Briggs, John Waters, Mal Arnold (Blood Feast) and many others who were involved in Herschell's classic films are here on this DVD.

If you are a fan this is a must see. If you have not seen any of Herschell's films but have an interest in classic horror cinema this may be a good introduction to his work.",1491868800,,1743,4.578778135048232

8456358,4,B0054602XU,"He has often been called offensive, untalented, degenerate, and utterly reprehensible, but to Horror fans, he is best known as Herschell Gordon Lewis, the Godfather of Gore! With BLOOD FEAST, Lewis and producer David F. Friedman introduced the world to the very first gore film, which changed the cinematic landscape forever. Now, director Frank Henenlotter (BASKET CASE) takes a look back at Lewis' remarkable career in the new documentary HERSCHELL GORDON LEWIS, THE GODFATHER OF GORE. From his early beginnings in the 'Nudie Cutie' films to the advent of gore and on through to his later entries like THE WIZARD OF GORE and THE GORE GORE GIRLS, we are given the complete and definitive history for one of Horror's most influential filmmakers as told by his cast and crew along with many other special guests. In addition to both David F. Friedman and H.G. Lewis, notable critics and directors like Joe Bob Briggs, John Waters, and even Frank Henenlotter, himself, pop in with insightful commentary and hilarious stories surrounding the films. GODFATHER is sharply edited with a wonderful integration of film clips that enhance each conversation on screen. Henenlotter has chosen only the most interesting and engaging stories to include in the documentary, along with over an hour of additional scenes that did not quite make the cut. Viewers are also given the very first look at Lewis' never-before-seen AN EYE FOR AN EYE, which remains unedited and unreleased to this very day. While the documentary will certainly only appeal to hardcore exploitation and gore fans, admirers of Herschell Gordon Lewis will admit that this is a fitting tribute and an excellent book end to a wild and crazy career.

8456362,4,B0054602XU,"Well, Lewis finally gets his own documentary! And how is it?  Well, it's good.  The thing about it is that this film will only be viewed by Lewis fans. And because cult horror fans are such buffs for behind the scenes information, there probably isn't a lot in this documentary that fans didn't already know.  We still like watching this stuff though, even if we do know most of what we're being told already.
Naturally this film focuses on Lewis' film career in as much depth as the running time allows.  Lewis made so many films that there wouldn't really be enough time to look at each one individually, and as a result, many are briefly mentioned or skipped over entirely.  The focus is mainly on his early days with the ""nudie cuties"", and of course, the gore films.  It doesn't cover his comeback with Blood Feast 2, but stops after his initial retirement from film with 1972's The Gore Gore Girls.
It's definitely a career retrospective and not a biography, as practically nothing is mentioned about his upbringing or childhood-Nothing really about his personal life at all, except that he has a very nice house!  I suppose I would have liked to get into the man's mind a bit more, as Herschell is a rather fascinating man.  His personality is so at odds with his films that it's staggering.  I met him once myself and found him to be an absolute joy to talk to.
Insights into Lewis are given by David Friedman, Joe Bob Briggs, John Waters, Frank Hennenlotter(who also served as co-director of this documentary), and various individuals who have worked with Lewis over the years.  It's cool to see Mal Arnold and Ray Sager today, and hear what they have to say.
Anyhow, this is a film made for a very specific audience, and I'm sure that that particular audience will check this movie out at some point, good reviews or bad.
But for the record, it is good!",1336867200,4,1863,4.5675675675675675
