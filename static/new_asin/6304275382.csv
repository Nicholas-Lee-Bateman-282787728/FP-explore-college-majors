I heard these songs from this performance before I actually heard any studio versions--that's how good this performance was.  CULT FOREVER",1332460800,,489,5.0246913580246915

When you watch this, you know why the theater was filled to beyond capacity with people wandering in to find they had stumbled upon a fantastic band and a great show. It's a performance you don't want to look away from. This is the era where Ian shines, seeming so comfortable where he's at just doing what he loves and not afraid to let the world see inside. And, what a voice!!!",1210809600,,438,4.226190476190476
