3764641,4,B001QEIHOU,"Milking the Rhino was a great insight into the progression of African land conservation. Following two different groups both with issues of conservation facing them, they establish an understanding as to why keeping wild life and natural lands as they are and the benefits that keeping both of these brings with it. It may seem like a really basic concept to those in western civilization and societies where money and resources are abundant but to the people of Kenya and Namibia it's a struggle to convince people to follow a conservation perspective.

My favorite of the 2 different situations certainly was with the first camp the Il Newebe I believe it was. I really enjoyed how they explained to the people the value of keeping this lodge there and keeping wildlife around. Before the lodge, wildlife was poached and the grasslands were threatened to overgrazing. However one of the things that really made me ""weary"" was when hey were selling their goods to the tourists. The 2 managers of the conservation effort really had disagreement on this and  I feel that the villagers should be able to make a profit for the conservation group, for a lack of a better term exploiting their villages and making the landscape ""groomed"" to appear as if it was never tracked upon.  The most interesting ""theme"" I found in this movie was the idea proposed to saving wildlife while so many villagers told stories where they were for hunting wildlife to protect cattle. These animals are what bring a lot of Eco-tourism in as people want to see what they see in National Geographic as the movie put it.  What I didn't like about this was the village proposition after the conservation group. The lady that ran that conservation mission in my opinion seemed heavily in it for profit. She did however teach the workers how to properly set tables and say that this was the only 100% to the village profit org which does soften my views on her.

Overall this movie does a great job at showing the progression of African land conservation. Hopefully, the African people of Namibia and Kenya can understand the value that Eco-tourism plays in that area. Without the grasslands, lions , rhinos and elephants Africa becomes just another hot place on the earth and that means trouble for tribes that are now seeing the benefits of income associated with conservation lands and Eco tourism as a whole.",1392681600,,2383,4.802439024390244
3764642,5,B001QEIHOU,"This fascinating video moves around Africa, with a focus on Kenya, showing the problems and successes of community-based conservation. I especially enjoyed seeing James of Il N'gwesi, an endlessly patient, wise, and motivated Maasai who persuaded his community to set aside a large portion of their grazing land for wildlife and who oversees a safari lodge built on that land. I've been there and met James and now understand how the stresses of drought can threaten the best plan. I wish everyone could go to Kenya and see this place and understand how conservation can serve the needs of people who live off the land. This film is next-best and shows the difficulties of promoting tourism-based conservation in other countries as well. Beautiful land and animals, fascinating people, and an important story.",1303430400,,809,5.136363636363637
3764643,5,B001QEIHOU,"The film focuses mainly on an initiative by local Masai to protect wildlife against poaching and to create environmentally and economically sustainable livelihoods in an time of life threatening drought. Local villagers create a tourist lodge attracting foreigners to view exotic wildlife - a scheme producing economic benefits for village herdsmen and other food producers. The income this brings in creates a powerful incentive for the entire village to be vigilant against poachers, who have placed the Kenyan rhino and lion population on the verge of extinction.

There are also clips from a similar endeavor by the Himba of Nambia, which isn't nearly as successful. A perception by some villagers that the decisions and profits aren't being shared equitable ultimately leads to its downfall.

3764644,4,B001QEIHOU,"The movie was very good, I would have liked a little more detail and in-depth discussion though.  Gave a good background on conservation in Africa.",1261699200,,147,4.88
3764645,5,B001QEIHOU,"Millions of Americans have ties to Africa. Millions of us are descendants from that vast continent. AND, millions more are directly involved in programs aimed at helping Africans improve their lives. I can't think of a megachurch I've visited in the past decade that doesn't participate in an African outreach program of some kind. Add to that all the Americans working to preserve African wildlife--and a whole lot of us have a personal stake in Africa.

BUT--most American efforts to help Africans still involve well-intentioned outsiders bringing assistance to Africa--much of it terrific stuff! Don't stop helping people!  But--consider this: What happens when the Africans themselves begin to develop their own strategies for healthy development? Sometimes, these noble efforts lead to clashes. Sometimes, as Westerners, we don't even think Africans are capable of making wise choices.

The eye-opening documentary, ""Milking the Rhino,"" is a film that should be seen by millions of Americans who want to make a difference in Africa. If your church or small group is supporting African development programs--order a copy of this film right now. You need to see it.

This is a gorgeous documentary with lots of stunning wildlife footage. What makes it unique is this: It's also a movie that will whip your head around by showing you not just the startling wildlife we all love to watch on screen. Instead, the filmmaker ""turns the camera around"" and shows us the Africans living near the wildlife. The film really focuses on the abilities of Africans themselves to sort out their own healthiest approaches toward eco-friendly development.

The filmmakers take us both to the Meru region of Kenya and to Namibia, exploring the work of African men and women in developing nature conservancies to attract tourism. It's surprising to see how much peaceful, creative, eco-friendly innovation is possible when the Africans themselves begin to develop the strategies they will follow.

If you're thinking of watching this film with a small-discussion group, it's appropriate for high school through adult ages.",1240963200,6,2106,5.290419161676646

8335441,5,B001QEIHOU,"Excellent look at traditional cultures and tourism and environmental sustainability.  Need this to replace a copy I lost, hope it becomes available (it's still backordered).",1412121600,,173,5.92
8335442,5,B001QEIHOU,"I purchased this after watching it for a class and absolutely love it. A good watch for anyone who would like to see both sides of the poaching vs. tourism problem in some parts of Africa. ""Poaching vs. tourism"" is a simplistic way to put it, but it sums up the intentions of roughly two sides of the debate going on today - should we save endangered species for the sake of profitable eco-tourism, or should we allow the indigenous residents of these countries to protect their familes and livestock by killing these animals? A difficult question, and one that this movie certainly shows many sides to.

However, due to some cinematography and directing decisions, this film did suffer from bias, as most documentaries do. There was a clear bias against one woman who is seemingly in charge of a tourist location and who is shown to have little regard for the authenticity of the indigenous people who live there. I could not tell if the woman truly felt that way, or if the camera choices simply portrayed her in a bad light. As with any film, the things you don't see on the camera sometimes offer a more complete picture.

Overall, fantastic film. Highly recommended.",1403049600,,1171,4.679611650485437
8335443,5,B001QEIHOU,"The film Milking The Rhino gave good insight on how new conservation methods can be successful in African countries. I thought they did a wonderful job of illustrating the issues between the conservationists and local communities and how they are successfully educating the communities that they can conserve and make a profit. This film is an important documentary for Americans and other first would countries to view because it reminds us that there are people living much differently than the way we live and their lives and needs should be viewed equally, if not more importantly than are own.",1393372800,,598,5.05050505050505
8335444,4,B001QEIHOU,"The film shows the multiple layers of African life for two different tribes and the traditional cattle herding culture clashing with the up-and-coming modern community-based conservation used for ecotourism. Making land fit for conserving wildlife and maintaining lodging for tourists while keeping the cattle out of these areas documents the difficulty of finding equilibrium within the areas.
The film is a good representation of how African communities are trying a new method of conserving land while still making a profit. It shows that not everyone agrees, but things still seem to be working well enough and the ecotourism is getting larger and turning more and more of a profit while increasing abundance of rare and endangered species. It was nice to see this side of Africa that is not normally documented. I enjoyed the way the film went through the history of how the natives ended up as cattle herders and what their modern life is. There is a diversity of people who are interviewed with multiple opinions. There were a few points I would have liked to have had explained more in depth, such as the discussion of myrrh and how they were planning on marketing it and if they would be sustainable with that as well. However, overall the film was something unique and captivating.",1393286400,,1291,4.953917050691245
8335445,4,B001QEIHOU,"After watching Milking the Rhino, it has become very clear that land conservation is an important issue. Throughout the film a main focus was on areas that once flourished with wildlife were now being converted into cattle land. There were many natives that only cared about their cattle and not about the wildlife, because they didn't know the importance it had on the land and its people. This had to change, and I think that in the film this was shown very well with a great outcome of conservancies.

Overall this movie had a great goals and really got a message across about how important it is to conserve our lands.

I would recommend watching. Great Job",1393286400,,661,4.641025641025641
8335446,4,B001QEIHOU,"Milking the Rhino is an appropriate name for this film. The idea of conservation was new to the Maasai people and seemed unlikely to help them. Although they milk their cows to survive, now the Rhino and other amazing African wildlife are being ""milked"" by bringing in tourism dollars to support the community.

This film does an excellent job of showing the difficulty of sustaining traditions in an ever shrinking globalized world. The Maasai cattle herds men were being threatened by encroaching wildlife because of a drought. Cows and people were being killed and the community wanted to fight back against the animals. Instead of killing them a local visionary sought to conserve territory for the wild animals to serve as a tourist attraction. The community helped build the Il N'gwesi lodge which has helped create a balance between traditional cattle ranching and tourism revenue.

Excellent film, very informative and inspiring.",1393286400,,937,5.198675496688741
8335447,4,B001QEIHOU,"Milking the Rhino was a very informational film that covered a wide variety of perspectives and different views on land conservation. I really thought the film did an excellent job being unbiased and showed why each group had its reasons for the way they wanted to deal with Africas natural land. The main dispute in the film was between the local conservationists and cattle ranchers in the area. The conservationist point that I liked best was that if the land was not over grazed than biodiversity would increase and the resulting big game would draw in tourists. In addition the land would be healthier so cattle would have more vegetation to graze on. To me this was a win-win situation and was just one of the many points that were made in the film.

  I also really liked how the effect of climate played a major role in the story. Basically it showed that in times of drought, cattle ranchers become much more determined and will do whatever it takes to make sure their cattle can graze, even if it means going onto protected lands. The film does an excellent job bringing in personal perspectives with the many interviews that were shown from both sides. The one that I liked best was with one of the conservationists grandfathers who discussed how back in the 50s when there was a similar drought, the white men would pay lots of money for elephant tusks. Though it was illegal to hunt elephants, the people had no choice because the drought was affecting their normal lifestyle and as a result were forced to use drastic measures to make money.

  After watching this film I have become more aware of the many variables that factor into land conservation, especially in Africa and I would strongly encourage anyone interested in the subject to watch this movie.

  I would give this film an 80/100 rating or 4/5 stars.",1393286400,,1829,4.672897196261682
8335448,4,B001QEIHOU,"From my perspective I think that Milking the Rhino did a fantastic job at portraying places throughout Africa that have all begun conservation efforts. These different cultures and tribes have begun setting up conservation areas, not in the hopes to preserve wildlife per say, but in the hopes of promoting tourism. By setting up these conservation areas and instituting lodges they are hoping that an increase in tourism will bring in revenue that will in turn help their communities. I think this way of thinking is a new and very interesting way at looking and promoting conservation and it seems to be beneficial for most of the communities that have become involved in such conservation efforts. At first the communities were skeptical and unsure as to why this would benefit them but once the revenue started coming in I think more people started to warm up to the idea of community conservation and tourism lodges.

I think my favorite part about this film is the fact that we got to see first hand how these lodges were run and who was running them. Its great to see that these people from Kenya and Namibia are taking a real interest in conservation efforts and are learning and growing as people and a tribe because of the new opportunities they are getting from interacting with other cultures. I also really enjoyed how honest all of the participants were. Everyone that was interviewed acted very genuine when it came to talking about their true feelings and thoughts about the conservation efforts that their communities were starting to take. Overall I think this documentary does a great job highlighting new ways that conservation is being handled and it really shows how many different ways there are to getting a hold on conservation.",1392854400,,1753,4.882550335570469
8335449,5,B001QEIHOU,"For many cultures in Africa, including those highlighted in the film, cattle are their main source of life and they saw no reason to conserve wildlife. It was an alternate source of meat and a potential threat to their cattle. In a changing world, both environmentally and socially, some began to see the benefit of conserving lands for wildlife. Not specifically to protect species but to instead create tourism opportunities that could then bring in revenue for communities. Thus came the idea of milking the wildlife like milking the cow; benefits could come from both. However still many people within the native communities could not see the benefits and did not understand the need to conserve when it was their way to raise cattle. In the U.S. there is not as much a cultural conflict as there is profitable land conflict. It was interesting to see how conservation is dealt differently in other countries and how the benefits of conservation vary within different minds.

What I loved most about the film was that everyone freely spoke their opinions, the patience of the conservation leaders, and their perseverance even when things were going wrong. I felt that all the individuals in the communities were genuine and their motives were made clear, going back to the idea that transparency within organizations is key to trust and success.",1392681600,,1349,4.995555555555556
