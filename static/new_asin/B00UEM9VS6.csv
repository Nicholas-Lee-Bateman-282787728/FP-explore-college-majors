7036295,5,B00UEM9VS6,"Sensational and well done documentary on one of the greatest players in ABA/NBA history. It is a classic DVD that defines how Erving was the key that forced the merger of the two leagues, the coming together of two rivals that saved them both and catapulted pro basketball into the powerhouse it is today. Without him pro basketball would be only a shadow of what it has become not only in the US, but globally. This film contains lots of seldom seen clips of Dr. J at his high-flying best, in the NBA and NBA as well as in the famed Rucker Summer league. Watch him do things  Michael Jordan tried to replicate. Many of the highlights are astounding. His legacy, not only his greatness as a player, but as an ambassador for the game of basketball, is cemented in this film. It is one every true basketball fan should have iin his library.",1431648000,3,838,4.441558441558442
7036296,5,B00UEM9VS6,"Peace! It's me. Simply put, the Doc rocks. No frills, man to man,  straight jam in your face man. He'd clear a body out with one hand and lambaste you with the other. You can c Air learned a lot from watching the Dr operate. His ferocity was unmatched when he ran roughshod thru the ABA and early 6ers yrs. Im goin on record to say if a young Julius went against a young Michael, after viewing this dvd, i'd have to pick the Dr. He was the Assassin before the Assassin. Excellent dvd. Wish it had more ABA footage on Erving though. Peace!",1431561600,3,538,4.173076923076923
7036297,5,B00UEM9VS6,"This documentary does a great job of showing all his great moves on the court & sharing his personal tragedies. I recorded this months ago & just watched it.  I'm so glad to find it on Amazon! I was a teenager when Dr. J was in his prime & wasn't much of a basketball fan. But, like my father & everyone else... I was a big fan of his.  I had the honor of meeting & taking a picture with him at the Basketball Hall of Fame awards a few years ago & he was very humble, gracious & still very easy on the eyes. :).His story of resilience is worth sharing with all of the young people in your life.",1429574400,4,594,3.9008264462809916
7036298,5,B00UEM9VS6,"If you're a fan of the Doctor (as I already was), this video has so much terrific footage of the Doc.  While it contains the classic pieces, such as the 1977 dunk contest, the floating behind the backboard to the opposite side of the rim against the Lakers, the rock the baby dunk over Michael Cooper, etc., it also has some amazing video that I'd never seen before, such as Dr. J's appearance at the Rucker Tournament in NYC, circa 1971, other great ABA video, as well as some really introspective moments with the great Dr. J.  The interview clip with Michael Wilbon of PTI, stating ""I'd never wanted to see an athlete as much as I'd wanted to see Dr. J"" - awesome.",1488758400,,667,4.370967741935484
7036299,5,B00UEM9VS6,"Maybe I'm giving this such high marks because I've always been fond of the Doctor. I grew up an ABA fan, and in the last years of the league, he WAS the ABA. He was the last great word-of-mouth athlete who arrived in the NBA mysteriously, the vast audience not knowing who he was. It's hard to find videotape footage of the ABA, so I enjoy what I can get. Doctor J is my all time favorite athlete. When he was with the Sixers I would watch them play anybody on TV, just to see what Julius Erving would come up with.",1485475200,,515,4.0588235294117645

7036314,5,B00UEM9VS6,"I watched his carrier unfold and still loved re-living his basketball story. It's hard to imagine any player with more skills, talent and self drive than the Doctor. For me the greatest player that I ever saw and I saw Wilt, Magic, Michael and the most decorated Bill Russell. A must buy for any fan of the game.",1450915200,,312,4.396551724137931
