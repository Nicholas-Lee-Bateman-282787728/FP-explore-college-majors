2665801,4,B000J10HXA,"The ""Range Busters"" is the new name of the Mesquiteers movies which had John Wayne and Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan, and the truth be known that series of movies, made me as big a fan of Crash's as I am the Duke's.

The plot is predictable, the actor seem to have just ""called in"" their lines, there is some humor (most falls flat) and the action is only so-so, which is a reason for three stars.  It did however make me look-up Black Bart (which I found out was a real person) and that again is the reason for four stars, any movie that makes me do research is worthy of an extra star (fourth).  A minor spoiler:  Crash does not end up with the girl and the end.

It is a good example of the ""B"" movie genre, it is great family fare, and it is worth popping popcorn (the real stuff not the microwave) to watch.",1386806400,,803,4.089171974522293
2665802,3,B000J10HXA,"Wrangler's Roost, 1941 film

The story begins with four horses pulling a stagecoach. A man orders them to halt, then throw down the express box. Another hold up by Black Bart, ""who committed all his robberies with an unloaded rifle"". [Do you believe it?] One day he dropped his handkerchief, and a laundry mark led to his capture. After his release from prison he disappeared. Next we see the ""Range Busters"" riding on a country road. The express company called then in for a job: to catch this robber. Crash will visit Apache Butte to gamble, the others will operate separately to discover the identity of Black Bart. [Comedy is part of this movie.] The owner of the gambling casino wants to expand, and needs money to buy new property. Crash is lucky at roulette. The Deacon wants to rid the town of gambling and drinking (and the people it attracts). The ""Range Busters"" will shadow the stagecoach. They learn it was robbed, and follow the tracks of a lone rider until he gives them the slip.

Joe Collins refuses to sell his lot to Miller. Crash donates $50 to the church. Miller tells his men there won't be any camp meeting in this town. He orders the church members out of the schoolhouse. [No ""separation of church and state"" then.] A fight provides the action. The deacon pulls his pistol to end the conflict. [Is this a clue?] Miller lures Collins into a poker game, then offers him a lean against his property. [A rigged game?] The deacon replaces Collins in this poker game and wins big. The next day the ""Range Busters"" follow the deacon. A man orders the stagecoach to stop, but it doesn't. Crash follows the hatless man and rescues his pals. The ""Range Busters"" caught the stage robber. The old Black Bart is dead. Their mission was accomplished.

This movie uses the themes common to westerns. A prominent man in town is in reality a robber. Another man is wrongfully accused of crimes. There is conflict between Crash and Dusty over a young woman, but leave for their next adventure. The sidekick provides comedy (or music). How many TV dramas follow part of this formula?",1292889600,,2089,4.640540540540541
2665803,5,B000J10HXA,"Good entry in this series with our 3 heroes tracking down vetern stage robber Black Bart who has disappeared since being paroled 10 years ago. It seems he's back in the business, but is he? Fans of this stuff will easily guess who Black Bart really is while bad-guy George Chesebro commits the robberies. Good banter between John Dusty King and Ray Crash Corrigan, especially when trying to gain female attention. Max Alibi Terhune and his dummy (who's really smarter than most of the cast) Elmer are also on hand. The print quality on this Alpha release is quite good, very clear and much better than some of their other Range Buster films. All in all, an enjoyable B-Western experience. Enjoy.",1210982400,,695,4.75206611570248
2665804,4,B000J10HXA,"Monogram Pictures presents ""WRANGLER'S ROOST"" (4 June 1941) (57 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- With the success of Republic's Three Mesquiteers, several forces came together around 1940 to develop a new 'trigger trio' for the screen --- The star was Ray 'Crash' Corrigan, a producer named George W. Weeks and Monogram Pictures --- With a character of his own name. Ray starred in 20 of the 24 films in this series between 1940 and 1943 --- The Range Busters was clearly a lower budget copy of the Mesquiteers --- Big, muscular Ray 'Crash' Corrigan was the lead, the second lead was John 'Dusty' King, a big band singer (Ben Bernie Orchestra) with a reasonably good baritone, who would vocalize a tune or two in each film --- And comic relief was in the hands of ventriloquist Max 'Alibi' Terhune (and his wise-cracking dummy Elmer --- Monogram would distribute the Range Busters but not be directly involved in the productions --- The deal gave Corrigan a substantial share of the film profits (in an interview years later, Ray said he received 50%).
