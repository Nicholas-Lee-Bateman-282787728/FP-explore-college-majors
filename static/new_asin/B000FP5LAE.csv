8125261,3,B000FP5LAE,"This film's title is misleading -- it's not about mountain gorillas but about the career of a Belgian photographer and filmmaker who spent most of his career in Rawanda. He had to leave in 1994 when the genocides broke out. This means that almost all of the film is pre-1994 and so we do not see how the gorillas are at the time this film was made in 2001. Gorillas only take up part of the film -- the other bits are about volcanoes and an aboriginal tribe wiped out in the 1994 genocide. The gorilla parts are worth waiting for, but the others -- well, who cares, really? I want to see gorillas.",1521331200,,597,4.245614035087719
8125262,5,B000FP5LAE,I work at the zoo with the Apes.  I am always looking for something on DVD or in book form to donate for our silent auction every year.  I specifically look for this one every year.,1290988800,,181,4.0
8125263,3,B000FP5LAE,"I loved the intimate view in gorllialife. I was stunned however to see that about a tenth of the movie has been blurred. All the nude parts of people apart from their heads and everything around it were blurred. It says on the cover: 'Contains scenes of tribal nudity.' It should have said: 'Contains a lot of vague scenes.' It's shocking to find that Americans (I bought it here on Amazon) are willing to damage a piece of art because people in it are shown the way they are born. After a while your eyes get so confused that you keep seeing the blur after it's gone. What a stupidity.
That and the fact that the gorillas are too little to be seen in this movie (because it's combined with images of lots of people, vulcano's, landscape, other animals etc) spoils it a lot.",1203724800,4,774,4.381944444444445
