8692452,4,B00QR1JZ84,"The four star rating is for the film ""The Clones"" and not the DVD release which is a terrible transfer and only gets 2 stars. I'm glad I have it on disc though, since my VHS is starying to wear out. The VHS print looks much better than whatever they used on this, and has cooler cover art too!",1527206400,,293,3.983050847457627
8692453,5,B00QR1JZ84,"This is what a movie looks like. Please take notes all wanna-be directors and producers that make films with 7 characters that take place in one room ! This film has special effects, car chases, creepy cinematography ( like the dwarf that tries to use the payphone when the protagonist is in the middle of an escape), and even a shootout that happens on a moving roller coaster! When was the last time you saw one of those? Cons: The 70's soundtrack does get a bit monotonous, but not overly so. Overly inept federal agents",1526774400,,523,4.515789473684211
8692454,4,B00QR1JZ84,"bad actors but in my sight I saw some things that definitely have been reworked and reimagined into bigger works of more modern writing, cinematography and costume design/casting. (The two agents feel like early inspiration in at least lax mannerisms and wardrobe to Pulp Fiction for me)",1524528000,,287,5.127659574468085
8692455,3,B00QR1JZ84,"Another of the films I saw at the drive-in (ask your grandparents). A decent premise, and one of those films where the ending was obvious if you saw any of these 'cerebral' items in the early 70s.

Perhaps one of the most surprising things from this item was when researched, the main actor, Michael Greene, has had a long and storied career in film stretching to this day. He's been steadily working churning out performance after performance over the years in some well-known titles you can look up on IMDB.",1522627200,,509,4.655555555555556
8692456,2,B00QR1JZ84,"After a dire warning about the coming of human cloning, and opening credits w/ awesome oscilloscopes and gargantuan, refrigerator-sized computers, THE CLONES (aka: DEAD MAN RUNNING- 1973) begins. Right off the bat, something has gone horribly awry. Dr. Gerald Appleby (Michael Greene) has run into a bit of a problem. It seems there are now two of him! Enter Nemo (Gregory Sierra), an overly zealous government agent sent in -along w/ his more easy-going partner- to ""neutralize"" the situation. Nemo is intense, goggle-eyed, looking and acting as though he could fly apart at any second! It's obvious that he would just as soon shoot Appleby dead, as look at him! Meanwhile, Appleby's doppelganger is busy enjoying Appleby's life, including his wife! Appleby escapes from Nemo and his cohort, and the chase is on. Can Gerald solve this mystery, before he's killed? This movie has lots of groove-tastic music, especially when Appleby runs in ssssllllowww mmmotiiionnn, which he does quite frequently. Suddenly, he's in a hippie bus w/ brain-altered hippies. Flashbacks! Psychedelic Tai chi! Appleby walks in on a guy on the toilet. Is he part of the conspiracy? More huge computers, computing computations! Gerald learns the horrible truth. He crashes his car, and it goes up like it's made out of TNT! Ultimately, the preposterous reason for the cloning is revealed, having to do w/ world domination through meteorology (!). Astonishingly, for all the action taking place, this movie still manages to be extremely tedious. It could have easily been trimmed by 20-30 minutes, and even then it could have used some further editing. The shoot-em-up, carnival finale, attempts to make up for the rest of this cinematic tumor by having a high body count. Nemo even throws grenades while riding a roller coaster! It almost works. Almost...",1519603200,,1833,5.154362416107382
8692457,2,B00QR1JZ84,"A cool cult film, ruined by a truly awful transfer.

Nuff said. Not in widescreen, but the transfer is truly awful. The entire film looks horrendously out of of focus. It's pathetic --- The trailer which can be found on one of the video sharing sites has better quality than this DVD.

This is the first DVD release where I feel the need to track down the VHS instead!

Whoever owns the rights to this ---- Please scrap this horrible release and do a scan of a faded release print. It would still look better!",1428969600,3,509,4.336842105263158
8692458,2,B00QR1JZ84,"As a sci-fi fan, I am always looking for one of those hidden gems that aren't well known, so I was looking forward to seeing the new release of the 1973 film THE CLONES, a film I had never heard about.

I just watched the new DVD release of THE CLONES and the presentation is terrible. The film is not in widescreen, as it was originally shot, with my first indication that things were amiss being during the opening credits that were partially cut-off on the right side of the screen.

Also disappointing is the picture and sound quality, which is obviously from a a poor VHS transfer.  The picture lacks any sharp detail and the sound was muddled, even with the volume somewhat raised.

The film itself was not very good, IMHO, though the story had potential. The sub par quality of this DVD release certainly didn't help.

There are no extras on the disc, which is another shame.  A featurette, or especially a commentary, would have added some value to this release.

If this was a legitimate release, it is an abysmal effort by the studio/producers and it will be a real disappointment to anyone who had been looking forward to it.

Not recommended.",1428019200,6,1154,4.567961165048544
