8325133,4,B000GRUTVM,"I notice that another  review said ""there are better resources out there"". I think there are none better than this series. I have been a martial artist since I was 8 years old and I was teaching Ju-Jitsu at the age of 21. My instruction in Bagua was of a traditional nature - ""watch me and follow"" there was almost no correction from the sifu until at the higher levels. There are many fragmentations of style in Bagua these days that have a direct tramsmission from a master. I have bought many DVD's to find something that is at a high level. This is at a high level.
Jacques Galinier is a martial artist that I had never heard of before and for me I just wished that I could find a vol. 4-10 of this series. I confess that I did not find anything interesting until vol. 3 (this review is for vol. 2).
If I had to summarize for this series so far. Vol 1-2 is basics and the real feeling of Bagua Zhang is just started in vol. 3
If someone thinks there are better resources on Bagua Zhang then please tell us as I can't find them and I want to find them.",1241308800,3,1055,4.096618357487923
