8403144,5,B003R2YVSU,We have several Horseland DVD's but this is by far the best as it has 10 stories on one DVD. Each story is an episode on its own. Our little one has played it time and time again - can't get enough of it. Perfect for travelling as several stories.,1350777600,,247,3.96
8403145,3,B003R2YVSU,"I purchased this under the impression that it was a movie but it is merely a few of the episodes from the series.  For the price of this DVD I was able to purchase the entire complete series of Horseland so these episodes are duplicate.  I would recommend buyig the ""complete series"" DVD to save yourself some money.  Fabulous series for kids!",1315094400,6,343,4.5
8403146,5,B003R2YVSU,My daughter has loved watching Horseland for years.  For a while we watched it on Saturday mornings then it went off the air but luckily we had some of the episodes saved on our TiVo & my daughter had 3 of the DVDs.  Then we found out it was on Netflix streaming TV so she could watch even more episodes.  Tonight I found out that the COMPLETE SERIES is on sale at Amazon for only $6.49.  It has 39 episodes for 14 hours worth of Horseland & it is cheaper (at least right now) than this disc which only has 10 episodes.,1302307200,,519,4.0588235294117645
8403147,5,B003R2YVSU,My children love this video and so do I because it teaches great character lessons. I would definitely purchase again!,1292716800,2,118,4.95
8403148,5,B003R2YVSU,"My kids love all the Horseland dvds. But I really just wanted to post the list of episodes included on this dvd since I couldn't find the list before I bought it. I was worried it was a compilation of the previous dvds, which it is not. 10 Episodes: 1) The Secret, 2) The Newbies, 3) A New Development, 4) New Pup in Town, 5) A Horse Named River, 6) The Last Drop, 7) No News is Good News, 8) Talk, Talk, 9) Oh, Baby, 10) Heritage Days. Total running time: 4 hours.",1284422400,32,465,4.010752688172043
8403149,5,B003R2YVSU,"Horseland: The Greatest Stable Ever Ten different episodes for about age 8 - 13 are good stories about real situations friends with horses might encounter. Each teaches a vital lesson of understanding others, helping the environment, listening, being a good friend, and other valuable lessons each teen would be happier practicing. This is a VERY good DVD to have in your home",1280016000,3,376,5.080645161290323
