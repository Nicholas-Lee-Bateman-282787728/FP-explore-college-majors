The videos on the DVD are:

""Video Killed the Radio Star"" by The Buggles

""Tainted Love"" by Soft Cell

""One Thing Leads to Another"" by The Fixx

""Poison Arrow"" by ABC

""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" by Tears for Fears

The two videos worth watching are ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" by The Buggles and ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" by Tears for Fears. The DVD is worth purchasing alone for ""Video Killed the Radio Star"". That video was the first video aired on MTV when it debuted way back in 1981. Largely because of the futuristic feel and look of the video, the video really hasn't aged that much. Not even the hairstyles of the artist appear outdated. The video delivered a powerful message and the song and video are still appealing to this day. The other video that has some merit is ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"". This Tears for Fears song was incredibly popular and made its way into several movie soundtracks. Outside of the futuristic ""Video Killed the Radio Star"", ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" is the most modern looking of the videos (though the mullets and open mouthed singing give the time period away). The video basically tells the story of a guy traveling across the country in his corvette. It's not much to look out, but the video is a great example of the transition music videos had made--by the time the video was made, artists weren't focusing on the music anymore and were focusing more on the images seen on the screen. I guess you could say that video killed the music video.",1410912000,,1781,4.512422360248447
8023920,4,B00028G7KM,"This disc only contains 5 videos but very good videos and songs.

Its a pretty good price and worth it if you are looking for a certain video from the past.

Videos-

1. Buggles- Video Killed the Radio Star from The Age of Plastic (1980)- said to the best first video debuted on MTV.

2. Soft Cell- Tainted Love from Non-Stop Erotic Caberet (1981)

3. Tears for Fears- Everybody wants to rule the world from Songs from the Big Chair (1985)

4. The Fixx- One thing leads to another from Reach the Beach (1983)

5. ABC- Poison Arrow from The Lexicon Of Love (1982)

Those are the videos as listed in the order on the DVD, but for some reason my DVD had Tears for Fears as the fifth video instead of the third like it says listed. Overall small collection of some groundbreaking videos of the 80s.",1112659200,,794,4.3175675675675675
8023921,3,B00028G7KM,"A word of caution: the video for ""Tainted Love"" on this collection is NOT the original 1982 clip (or version), but one of the many 90s remixes instead.  Sure, Marc Almond still appears in it (didn't watch it long enough to check for Dave Ball); nonetheless, the substitution should have been clarified on the packaging.  The other videos are worth owning (particularly the more-prophetic-than-we-ever-imagined ""Video Killed the Radio Star"") but are all available on other, more extensive collections (to the best of my knowledge).",1092700800,2,530,5.2976190476190474
