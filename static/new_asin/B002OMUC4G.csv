3962582,5,B002OMUC4G,"Joel Hodgson introduced and populariuzed the whole concept of making bad movies good by skillfully riffing on them. The master knows his game, and he and his entourage have never had a more deserving target for their collective wit than ""Doomsday Machine"". Back in the MST3K days I honestly wondered if those who made the movies Joel riffed on were intentionally thinking ""Hey! Let's make a movie so bad that people will enjoy making fun of it more than watching it"". I'm not wondering any more. This movie could only be taken seriously by someone with controlled substances in their system. If you can overlook the extremely shaky premise: foreign country has 1000% unconvincing-looking 'doomsday weapon', info is leaked to the US, US happens to have manned Venus probe ready (and be aware that astrophysical science of that era had already fairly determined that Venus was uninhabitable, so any mission would have been solely for research, not guaranteed landing and colonization) US yanks three male members of the mission off the roster and puts three women astronauts in their place.. if you can turn an undiscerning eye and ear to the dodgy sets, the unconvincing dialogue, the what-the-heck jumble of special effects and stock footage, etc... believe it or not, the last thirteen minutes of the movie are.. some other movie. Other actors, other sets, nothing matches anything that took place before.. I've watched and laughed at this disaster a dozen times and I'll be laughing countless times more. If ever there was a lump of cinematic clay that Joel and his friends could effortlessly turn into a beautiful monument to the Art of the Movie Riff, this is it - and do they ever. I can't even pick a favorite riff, there are so, so many to choose from. If you've read this far, you probably already like Joel and his Cinematic Titanic crew. You will LOVE this one.",1377043200,,1871,4.85
3962583,4,B002OMUC4G,"The riffs were mostly good, but the movie itself the Cinematic Titanic crew found is very painful to watch more than the Starfighters back in the MST3K days and probably the worst movie ever made. Spoiler alert, there is a scene with almost 8 minutes of nothing happening at the near end; ""It's like watching someone else watch Manos (one of the best jokes in this riff)."" There is sexism at least in the film itself even thought it was made in the early 1970s and also, there are very incompetent characters. Enjoy if anyone is interested in checking out what is passed off to be a film at all. :)",1373068800,,598,4.396396396396397
3962584,3,B002OMUC4G,"It's half of the MST 3k writers, with a bigger platform in front of the movie, and the 3 of the 5 crew stand the whole time. I found that distracting- they cover more of the movie. I missed theater spectators making fun of the movie, that really was part of what made MST 3K great. It missed Nelson's wisecracks just like rifftrax misses Joel's and Trace's dry and sarcastic wit. There were two scenes in the movie that was riffed well, the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2. It's also nostalgia, if I had not watched MST 3K before, I would have definitely given a 2.",1366416000,,573,4.218181818181818

3962586,5,B002OMUC4G,"Cinematic Titanic, Doomsday Machine, (#2)
Cinematic Titanic is an off-shoot of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (a.k.a. MST3K).
Both were created by Joel Hodgson, and other cast memebers are: Trace Beaulieu (original 'Crow'),
J. 'Elvis' Weinstein (1st 'Tom Servo'), Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl (all from MSTK).
J. Elvis created the theme song for 'Cinematic', and I really enjoy it.
This movie is in color and from 1972.  This is the second DVD offered by Cinematic Titanic ((#2).  I have watched it at least twice and it's still easy to miss (if any) refference to a 'doomsday machine'. Most of this is about a crew on a (USA) spaceship that was launched into space (shot on 'location'?) :)
The Riffs on here are Supurb!! (Riffs are comical comments said in-between the dialog.)
One of my favorite 'riffs' - ""Why does he need a name tag - alone in space?""
and towards the end a riff about 'It's a Wonderful Life' re: Clarance and George Bailey.
The trialer for this DVD can be seen on Youtube (as well as other 'Cinematic' Titles).
And Cinematic Titanic has it's own website.
Total Running Time, 1:26:45
There are no (MST3K) 'Bots' in 'Cinematic' - The 5 stand in sillouette.
I've seen all the released MST3K's - and this 'Cinematic' is at least as good - if not better. My favorite 'Cinematic' is 'The Oozing Skull', but this one is great too. I'll say it's a must.

Even though we all know they had to watch the movie several times to write the jokes, it's just more transparent that that's how it is done now.  Lets face it though.

However, there is far too much against working against the seriousness of the plot to allow it, with the assistance of the Crew, to bog down the enjoyment of the ridiculousness of virtually everything else in the film.

3962613,4,B002OMUC4G,"This was my favorite of the  Cinematic Titanic titles so far. The movie is bad but watchable which is a plus when watching any of these types of shows. Some movies are so poorly constructed that everyone gets bored because we can't follow it. Doomsday Machine is straight forward and would make a decent film in the right hands. However, only the wrong hands were involved with this project! (drum fill) I couldn't even find the film's details on IMDB which is rare indeed. Joel and the crew riff hilariously about the many different models that end up sharing billing as the Astra, the spaceship on its journey to Venus. Apparently the producers or the director didn't think anyone would notice. The movie comes to a screaming halt about 10 minutes before the end when it appears that an entirely new set of actors in a dimly lit set of a Russian space capsule spend literally three or four minutes of screen time not saying anything and with their spacesuited backs to the audience. This thrill sequence is interspersed with still pics of what appears to be a postcard of a spaceship near a blue orb. Breathtaking! As in one needs to go outside and get a breath of fresh air, come back inside, sit back down and resume watching the paint dry or this exciting scene. Anyway, highly recommended for the sci-fi, mstk3000 fan.",1390176000,,1324,4.634042553191489

3962615,5,B002OMUC4G,"The Titanic Crew were great! This movie, WOW! A CRAPTACULAR MESS!

SPOILER ALERT - Plot: Bubble wigged Chinese lady spy throws a cat over a wall and somehow is able to break into a building housing a Chinese doomsday machine. She takes pictures of it and shows them to some mustachioed guys who are supposed to be CIA? Then in the same movie, 7 men are getting ready for a two year space mission to Venus. At the last minute there is a news conference and B.J. from MASH asks a question. Casey Kasem talks into a mic at mission control. NEXT three men are dumped from the mission and replaced by three lady astronauts. Why? So they can repopulate the human race if the Chinese set off the doomsday machine. SO they do and the earth blows up. They finally figure out they are supposed to breed a new race of humans. This creepy captain flips out and tries to make it with the dumb astronaut girl and after a few attempts he gets a hot soldering iron across the face - Meanwhile - for some reason concerning fuel and radiation only 3 of the crew can survive the landing. The computer picks the three who will survive - Ruta Lee being one along with the dumb astronaut girl and the hunky other guy. Creepy captain flips out again and he and the dumb astronaut girl get sucked out into space after a really low LOW budget eye bleeding scene in the airlock. Meanwhile....Hunky guy decides that they will all attempt the landing. I think now there's like two astronaut ladies (one is a Russian lady astronaut) and this old guy, Bobby Van, and the Hunky guy. OK Still awake? As they are about to land the ship on Venus something goes wrong with the fuel tanks (or some gibberish) so Bobby Van gets into his space suit and takes a CROW BAR and tries to fix it but he's not strong enough so the Russian lady goes to help (they are in love). Watch out for this non-exciting scene. Try not to notice the thick wires attached to the ""actors""...NEXT it all goes really bad. Bobby Van and the Russian lady are left in space and somehow find and old Russian Apollo-looking cheap plastic model to get into. The other ship somehow is destroyed - but you never see it. SO Now Bobby Van and the Russian lady are in the Apollo-like capsule in space helmets (lost of standing around) Only Bobby Van and the Russian lady have totally different voices and you never see their faces again. NEXT... A voice from Venus tells them they are doomed and that the other ship is destroyed and I don't really understand the rest.

Was it really ""made"" in 1972??? Looks so much like a bad early 60's Three Stooges in Space kind of feel to it.",1388534400,4,2608,4.353182751540041

8376224,5,B002OMUC4G,"You haven't seen low budget until you've seen this.

The plot: China has created a doomsday machine (resembling R2D2) that will, in 72 hours, ""rupture the tension in the Earth's crust"" causing a runaway chain reaction. Why? That minor detail is never explained. Plus, they don't even announce it! How satisfying is that?  In response, the US modifies an all-male man-on-Venus mission (surface temperature of Venus: 900 degrees) into a ""lifeboat"" that will carry on the human race through the efforts of seven astronaut survivors: four men and three women. After the usual (free) Apollo stock footage, the crew takes off in some rented office space for a four-month journey.

The launch sequence contains none of the anticipated elements: tilting / zooming the of camera to simulate changes in orientation; shaking the chairs and/or camera to simulate lift-off vibrations, or engine noise (of a 365-foot tall Saturn V rocket). The actors, reclining in Barcaloungers, merely read their lines to indicate stages of flight.

During the voyage we observe the sexual tension amongst the crew members (who's in the bathroom now?); the antics of an emotionally unstable male astronaut (the navigator, who wishes death on Comedy Relief Guy, sneers at the Russian lady-astronaut, tries to force sex on the most attractive female, starts a fistfight with CRG, and screams I want to live after the Earth blows up); crises of various sorts (meteors hurled from the exploding Earth at greater-than escape velocity (not likely), non-directional radiation (no), technological failures (rocket stages that threaten not to work because the bolts won't release or something);  and near-death by computer (we're short of fuel, so you four find the nearest door, computer says so)).

Art direction: The U-store-it interiors are on lighted with plenty of shadows and blotches of color to disguise the plainness;  the astronauts sport football helmets and dishwashing gloves and (for the males) Champion-brand athletic sweats for casual wear;  Outside there are three completely different models spliced in from other movies used to represent the spaceship (a rotating space-station type thing, then a space-plane, then a shuttle-type deal).

Toward the film's end, they suddenly announce they are decelerating,  implying they have reached their destination, but there is no sign of Venus, and there are no montages or anything else to suggest that four months have passed.

Reportedly the film ran out of money and had to add the last ten minutes later with different actors (clad in space helmets to conceal their faces) and obviously different voices. It may be unique in film history in that regard.

The science errors include: after leaving Earth's orbit, they announce their velocity as 17,500 mph, which is less than escape velocity; the Earth's demise supposedly triples the radiation equally in every direction (whatever happened to the inverse-square law?); and during a course correction the captain tells the navigator to level out. Of the actors, the one with the greatest Q factor is Casey Kasem.

Although all Cinematic Titanic efforts are well worth watching, subjectively speaking I laugh harder at The Wasp Woman and The Alien Factor, yet I play this one the most for some reason. Recommended. ""My God... it's full of low-grade stars!""",1431043200,,3331,5.2622641509433965
