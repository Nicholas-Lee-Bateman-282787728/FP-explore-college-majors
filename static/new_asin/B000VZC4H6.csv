8220618,5,B000VZC4H6,"I cannot vouch for Mr. Aizik's military background, but his self-defense techniques are excellent. The Combat Survival DVDs (NOTE: this product appears to contain only one volume of the series) contain about five hours of practical, effective countermoves for knife, gun, choke, hold, and baseball bat attacks. It is the only video I have seen that covers pressure points, but not in great length, so as to confuse the viewer. He shows four pressure points that anyone can use, and they work. There are only two or three ground techniques but they are effective. I highly recommend these DVDs.",1265760000,3,593,5.0
8220619,1,B000VZC4H6,"Great looking video, flashy, well choreographed but.......

It is the usual flashy ckm stuff. Problem is the contents are not what moni claims, and if he is less than truthfull about that you have to ask questions about the rest. In short its infotainment, Moni has changed half the techniques since this was made and they are unproven and are not used by any military.  Reccomend some of the wagner stuff or mma leave this on the shelf.",1214870400,4,437,4.589743589743589
