They are from a Christian truth. Not the lies that are in other history movies. They are funny and keep the interests of children young and old.",1386288000,,205,4.5675675675675675
7916068,5,1589975286,"As the title mentions, this edition of Drive Thru History covers three main areas:

1.  Soldiers - Philadelphia area (Valley Forge, Germantown, Fort Mifflin).
2.  Jamestown - Jamestown, Williamsburg, Pocahontas, Yorktown.  Especially enjoyed this segment as I used to live in the area while serving in the US Air Force and often visited these locations.  Many pleasant memories!
3.  Heroes of Virginia - Jefferson, Washington, Madison, Slavery in Colonial America.

The narrator, Dave Stotts, does an excellent job of describing the importance of each site and shows appropriate reverance and humor.

The DVD lasts almost 1.5 hours and is a joy to watch.

Watch and be informed and entertained.

Highly recommended.",1306108800,,715,5.36036036036036

7916070,5,1589975286,"I HIGHLY recommend the Drive Thru History (DTH) Soldiers, Jamestown, and the Heroes fo Virginia DVD, as well as ALL the Drive Thru History Programs. For the past 10 years my family spends a week in Jamestown, Yorktown & Williamsburg Area of Virginia. There is wealth of history in that Area. I've always enjoyed the experience, but since watching this episode, I have more of a real feel for what I'm experiencing during our yearly visit. Dave Stotts has done an excellant job making history come alive, as well as make sense. I've always appreciated history, but never in my 60 plus years of life, enjoyed learning it, until the Drive Thru History Programs. I stumbled across his program, when he first started on TV. His narrative made learning history fun for me, as well as connected history together, which may be the biggest difference. History text books did much to dry up my interest in History, where the DTH series woke up my desire for learning & understanding history. Great Job Dave & your fantastic team! Thanks for also providing a school program that will stimulate children (and adults) to understand our world's past. We have ALL the DTH DVDs and have purchased many as gifts.
Drive Thru History DVD's have always been appreciated gifts...All Programs/Episodes/Series are winners!!",1265414400,,1300,4.940639269406392
