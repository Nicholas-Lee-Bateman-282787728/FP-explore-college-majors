8671578,5,B00MC3U3W8,"Excellent ""oldie"" portraying refugees on Ellis Island during WWII; not many movies show this side of the war. This movie, although somewhat of a love story, was a good portrayal of desperate refugees, from countries torn apart by war, wanting to get into America. I mainly bought this movie because I am a fan of Don Ameche; I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this film to any old movie buff!",1451433600,,400,4.647887323943662
