8139871,3,B000HIVIIS,"A cruise shipped owned by Hazel Buck (Hope Holiday) and commanded by Harry Dodds (Cameron Mitchell) visits Hong Kong and the passengers want to visit the forbidden Warrior's Island. Warrior's Island in inhabited by bizarre monks (lead by Vic Diaz) who can raise the dead, but need pretty naked women. Their supply of women comes from a man with a German accent and a Hitler mustache.

Cameron gives us a fine academy performance as a ship's captain, fire fighter, zombie hunter, bar fighter, and admirer of the female form. Unfortunately the cast around him, may have cheated him from another nomination with their horrible performances. Imagine Kinsley getting an award for that Gandhi thing, while Mitchell was killing zombies and reciting lines like ""I have to see a man about a horse"" and made us feel them.

The dead don't really become part of the film until 14 minutes from the end. They have their own slow motion swagger music until they have to Kung-Fu fight with a woman policeman (Jillian Kesner).

The VHS to DVD transfer was a joke. My DVD had visible tracking adjustment lines from time to time. Not just small ones either. Much of the movie takes place on the love boat undressing the women, something that would have been better scripted feeding them to the zombies.

What the film does have is ample nudity with just about all the women except the two top stars, doffing their tops for one reason or another.

3 stars for the camp value and nudity. ""Raw Force"" and ""King-Fu Cannibals"" are the same film. I imagined they changed the title because ""Kung-Fu Cannibals"" was too much of a plot spoiler for the Cameron Mitchell's sophisticated following.",1390521600,,1666,4.790940766550523
