8368302,2,B002ES0MGI,"I liked the cover, in fact the back cover is better than the front; But I paid no attention to one of the reviewers who didn't give it much rating. So I would like to give  a more comprehensive review for those who may be tempted to get it. First of all, I wanted to hear what was said in the courtroom(something different from most topics) and there was no sound whatsoever in the courtroom, sometimes lips could be read--I wanted to hear from the prosecutor, the defense, and the judge-- nothing, just lips moving-- then they would go to a room and do the same type scenes to steel guitar music--too long. Then the court would re-convene, and no audio, and so on..If they offered the cover only for 50cents I doubt if I would even get that.",1490745600,,742,4.338129496402877

8368304,3,B002ES0MGI,"You can tell that this movie is made from a shoestring budget. The proformaces from the actor is good, but not great.",1389052800,2,117,4.363636363636363
8368305,3,B002ES0MGI,"Long before her Vivid Video glory days and her days as a photographer, hip-hop artist and model, Heather Hunter started out with Vidway Video out of her home state of New York City.

Hung Jury is just your average adult movie. It gets three stars from me. Two of them are for Heather alone (her scenes, while clearly porn, have some erotic and I dare say class to them) and one is for one of her guest stars named Tami Monroe (who plays the judge in this film).

Incidentally, Heather would do a similiar film years later for Vivid called ""The Judge"" with a similiar plot but with a mostly African-American cast while this one is mostly white except for Heather.

Would recommended it mainly to Heather Hunter fans.",1289865600,19,715,4.5271317829457365
