2749910,3,B000MV8ADQ,"It appears to be the same show as reviewed elsewhere on Amazon DVDs, although there is an additional feature, a CD of recuts, which should please the fans, especially those unaware that Reddy actually had such a session.
At one point in the show she does some patter about how she does not do a *sensational* show, one with costume changes, and alot of bombast. Watching her talent and visuals, one finds it curious that she didn't come on like the female Tom Jones! May sound sexist over 40 years later but she had (and still has) it all.",1231632000,,539,4.454545454545454
2749911,5,B000MV8ADQ,This is a wonderful DVD of a Bobby Vee performance.  I'd like to see more DVD's of his performances.  There is NOTHING like a Bobby Vee concert....so DVD's of his performances are incredible.  Thanks for making this available.,1230854400,,226,4.894736842105263

2749913,1,B000MV8ADQ,"Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to read the reviews for this DVD before I purchased it. Had I read the reviews I would have thought twice before buying it. Well, needless to say, I am totally disappointed. Sub-par video quality and sound for one. Secondly, it is just a compilation of footage from Live Without a Net and Right Here, Right Now. Do yourself a favor and purchase them instead. Waste of money!",1215820800,14,412,4.506666666666667
2749914,1,B000MV8ADQ,Do not purchase If you already own Live without a net or Right here right now. This is not an authentic dvd or it would be on Van Halen website.,1214956800,9,144,3.8333333333333335

2749916,3,B000MV8ADQ,I really like Helen Reddy and her music. She has a unique voice and a choice of songs that showcases her talent beautifully. My only complaint about this product is that it is of very poor quality both visual and audiable. It appears to be a VHS recording trasfered to DVD. This was not told in the description when purchasing and should have been. The concert is good. I have seen Helen in concert in 1979. The quality is not. I gave this a 3 stars just because concerts of Helen are very rare and as a fan I am glad to get anything but be aware the DVD quality we have been use to for years is not there! It would be nice to see a company put out one of her live concerts in the DVD quality format.  Are you out there?,1212019200,,720,4.0
2749917,5,B000MV8ADQ,"I truly enjoy this DVD. I feel Robin is in tune with his audience and extremely upbeat throughout the concert. Though he does not have the Gibbs brothers backing his vocals, his background singers do an admirable job. His band does a wonderful job as well. The only awkward portion of the concert was listening to Robin performing Barry's disco hits. He just did not carry Barry's range while performing those songs. However, the blonde background singer fills in wonderfully and almost sounds like Barry. All in all, I feel it is a great concert as Robin looks right at home before the audience. Robin sung ""Juliette"" with the same precision as he did on the studio recording. If you are a Bee Gees or just a Robin Gibb fan, you will enjoy this concert from one of the world's greatest voices.",1420588800,2,794,4.598591549295775

2749924,3,B000MV8ADQ,"It's a good concert DVD. His voice isn't as strong as it used to be. Maybe he was already sick. But if you remember what his voice used to sound like, it's good to hear the old favorites again.",1366761600,4,193,3.9743589743589745
2749925,5,B000MV8ADQ,Just to watch Robin Gibb singing to Thousands of Fans in the Beautiful grounds of Ledreborg Castle in Denmark is a special Treat! Robin looks really Natural performing in this Concert and the Danish National Concert Orchestra is lovely. Robin will Live On--------- through his Magnificent Music.,1356652800,,295,5.297872340425532
2749926,4,B000MV8ADQ,Robin Gibbs is great in this DVD of him in concert. He is/was a great artist in his singing as well as his writing. He will be missed.,1355270400,,134,3.8214285714285716

2749928,4,B000MV8ADQ,"I received the DVD on time and in good condition.  Like other people who ordered this concert DVD, I noticed that it did not offer 5.1 surround sound as the packaging claims.  However, the concert was well worth it.  The setting was beautiful and the music was very good as well.  Robin had a way of appearing a bit ""stiff"" on stage but this time he actually appeared to be enjoying himself.  Now that he is gone (along with his brothers Maurice and Andy) I am glad I purchased this DVD while I had the opportunity.  God bless you, Robin.",1349740800,,538,4.33
2749929,1,B000MV8ADQ,"I felt obliged to write an honest review of this program.  Firstly, my Bee Gees credentials include traveling to Las Vegas for the One Night Only show which is so well captured on DVD and HIGHLY recommended&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bee-Gees-One-Night-Only-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B003UPPO2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bee Gees: One Night Only (Anniversary Edition)</a>.  This is bad on so many levels... the best thing about it is that its barely an hour so the pain it is sure to induce is quick. Robin was an essential element in the Bee Gees not only as a songwriter but his voice was a wonderful ""color"" to offset main man Barry and his more normal sounding twin Maurice. Robins quavering voice was always the perfect foil.  The problem is his voice is too iconic and when performing It is obvious he should stick to his solo repertoire. I don't care how many musicians he gets on stage with him or how many scantily clad women back up singers they surround him with .... it only amplifies the fact that he isn't Barry and when he sings Barry's parts it sucks.. and to a ridiculous level. If you want nostalgia buy a Bee Gees DVD , If you want to buy this because you love Robin and Maurice and Barry (the reason I bought it and his equally terrible alternate DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Gibb-with-the-Frankfurt-Neue-Philharmonic-Orchestra-Live/dp/B0009IXRRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Gibb with the Frankfurt Neue Philharmonic Orchestra - Live</a>&nbsp;)I understand, as I said I support Robin and spent 10 bucks on this to keep my Bee Gees collection complete.

But Please don't rave about the performance, Its odd at best, poor in many places, uncomfortable most of the time and musically a mess.",1345161600,3,1815,5.589090909090909
2749930,5,B000MV8ADQ,"I enjoyed this one a lot.

I think this one is better than the Robin Gibb with the Frankfurt Neue Philharmonic Orchestra - Live. He is singing better in this concert.

If you are a Bee Gees fan, go buy it!",1343433600,,205,3.975609756097561
2749931,5,B000MV8ADQ,My husband and I were both delighted with this DVD.  We have always loved the BEE GEES and did not know that Robin was so talented on his own.  We highly recommend you buy this.,1340323200,2,177,4.0285714285714285
2749932,5,B000MV8ADQ,"I personally truly enjoyed this Robin Gibb In Concert DVD. It was a sunshiney day in Denmark, Robin and his attentive audience were relaxed and the outdoor setting was expansive.

I am always mesmerized by Robin's connection to his songs, his sensitive nature, his clear and distinctive voice, and his very humble way of being on stage.

This DVD is for me, more enjoyable than the earlier, and longer concert show DVD recorded in Germany, as I reckon The Danish National Concert Orchestra and Robin's own band are more at one with the music and there is certainly more life surrounding them.

I am happy to see Robin smiling and singing 3 of his own songs (Alan Freeman Days, Saved By the Bell and Juliet) along with 14 of the Bee Gees hits in his personally unique way. I found every song was special.",1334707200,6,803,4.5625

2749934,4,B000MV8ADQ,"On the dvd case on the back cover it says DTS digital surround sound, however when you play the dvd it is only in Dolby stereo. On the main menu there is only play and song selections, there is no audio set up.",1310860800,8,210,3.9069767441860463
2749935,4,B000MV8ADQ,"Four years after Robin Gibb's Concert with the Frankfurt Philharmonic Orchestra, Robin returns performing from Denmark with the Danish National Concert Orchestra.  Without much fanfare, Robin and his band start right into, ""More Than A Woman"", bringing the audience into the excitement.  The songs continue with the typical Robin Gibb flair but there is not much new from the 2005 concert DVD, other than a few new songs.  Most notably is ""Alan Freeman Days"" which is probably the highlight of the concert.  ""Islands In The Stream"" is also a new live song and proves the audience is appreciative of its inclusion, but the spark is simply not there.  ""New York Mining Disaster 1941"" is also here, but in its original form and not as exciting a new interpretation that it was given on the previous DVD.  It is fortunate to hear Robins voice in the forefront and separated from the three excellent female back-up vocalists, but there is a question that begs answering.  Did Robin use computer altered singing in the final mix?  At times it does seem that his voice has that ""Glee"" style, but then again, Robin's vibrato has always been steady and unique.  I would have said there is none until I heard, ""Juliet"".  Its sounds just like he was singing a ""Glee"" song.  Even the percussionist looks at him several times as if he were out of tune.  No matter.  He still sends out a decent song, even if the audience doesn't sing along, as in other concerts.  One thing that is missing is the standard earphone or the classic Robin hand-clasp to the ear.  He does have five speakers that send his vocals directly back to him onstage, but is that enough?  It isn't until the final song that the uses his hand for sound balance.

It should be noted that this concert is about one-half hour shorter than the previous DVD.  It also does not have as much of the earlier interpretations that the other DVD had, other than a few minor alternate song endings.  Also missing are the songs, ""Please"", ""Love Hurts"" and ""My Lover's Prayer"", all songs that added a unique atmosphere to a public audience of adoring fans.  It is interesting to hear ""You Should Be Dancing"" sung in a normal ranged voice and have it come off as a strong concert song, but ""Jive Talkin'"" lacks the funkiness of the original.

The grounds and day concert atmosphere of the Ledreborg Castle are impressive with a large audience.  There is not a great deal of performer/audience interaction, but as a total entity, the concert works.  It's just a shame that there are no extras.  The biggest disappointment is that although the DVD claims to be in DTS Digital Surround Sound, it is only in stereo.  This is a technical item that is nearly unforgivable, particularly considering the expansive concert grounds and audience.",1310601600,9,2776,4.721413721413722

8172586,5,B000MV8ADQ,"My heart  went out to him as  I watched and listened to Robin. You could not help but notice he was not well. Yet he gave it his all.
I felt the ending was much better, and he was coming to an end as the fighter, yet the calm, sweet person that he was. You could tell
the women back up did their all to hold Robin's singing style up when his voice would not do as well and he should sound.
I am so glad I have this CD, because it was like saying good by to one of the best loved voices in my lifetime. This CD was his good by to
all of us, as fans of the beloved BeeGees, How brave he was to do this at a time when he knew he would not be with us much longer.
His bothers passing was not expected, But Robin knew how much time he had left, and walked bravely away as only Robin could, with his wonderful smile to a better place.",1423094400,2,828,3.7257142857142855
