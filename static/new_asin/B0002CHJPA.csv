2075936,5,B0002CHJPA,"I'm a fan of Tony Hillerman, having read most of his books. Frankly, I'm surprised at the middling ratings most people have given this movie. I thought it was wonderful, and the performances given by the cast were very satisfying. It's always a treat to watch a cast like this. My eyes are likely to brighten when I see the names Graham Greene, Wes Studi, Adam Beach and Tantoo Cardinal participating in a movie venture. I have added Sheila Tonsey and others to this last as well, having greatly enjoyed their roles in this series. Graham Greene has given another unforgettable performance as the oily Slick Nakai. I have to believe that he's now in my top five American actors. Tantoo gave a brief but typically engaging perfomance. Wes and Adam are now locked in my minds eye as Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. It was good seeing Peter Fonda again in is role. Chris Eyre did a fine job directing, and conveying the intent of the novel. Included is an engaging bonus feature with Tony Hillerman.

The review below me made some defamatory comments intending to be caustic, but which are patently untrue. Any resemblance to a soap opera has entirely escaped me. His observation that this movie sneers at Navajo attitudes toward the dead, Navajo spiritual or cultural matters, is impossible. Anyone who is acquainted with Chris Eyre knows the integrity of the director, having directed Smoke Signals and Skins, and has shown is dedication toward negating stereotypes and prejudice. Seems that the reviewer below was just looking for an opportunity to flog around the term ""injun"". People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, and the below reviewer might be concerned that his education has failed him. Moreover, keep your eyes on Chris Eyre, who promises to be attached to quality movies in the future.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and hope to see more. I will continue to devour anything written by Tony Hillerman, and seek out anything by these cast members.

My thanks are to Robert Redford as a co-producer of this series. I have admired the integrity of this man for quite some time, watching him place his effort and resources in the right place, time and time again. I tip my hat once again to PBS Pictures for distributing this series. PBS has been involved in offering us quality which is hard to find.",1113868800,131,2320,4.766169154228856
2075937,2,B0002CHJPA,"Take a novel.  Hand it to an inexperienced script-writer who only knows genre dialogue, and has never been outside the soap opera community.  Make a movie or a tv show that ignores the original audience because the script-writer doesn't read books.  So instead of the tongue-in-cheek dry dialogue of a Tony Hillerman, you get a stilted cliche As The World Turns with Injun cops.  And I use the word ""Injun"" advisedly.  The sneering at the Navajo attitude toward the dead, and at their culture is unbelieveably crass.  And the writing down for an American audience -- well, perhaps our reputation for a trashed educational system is getting too well recognized in the world.",1111017600,11,673,4.911504424778761
2075938,5,B0002CHJPA,"I cannot agree with the negative reviewers. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, like I did the two previous ones in this series. I love mystery novels/films, and this one was not difficult to comprehend at all. An added bonus is the setting of the story in the for me - a European living in the US - completely new world of Native American history and culture. I don't know the novels of Mr. Hillerman, so I don't have the great expectations of someone who has read them. I think anybody who loves a good mystery and is interested in getting an introduction into Native American lore and culture of the Southwest should enjoy the movies in this series. I certainly hope there will be more of them.",1099785600,50,694,4.47244094488189
2075939,3,B0002CHJPA,"I really wanted to like ""A Thief of Time"", having read the book on several occasions. Unfortunately, the film makers decided to cram a complex mystery into a mere 90 minutes. While this worked with ""Coyote Waits"", the previous film in the series (although, they are being made out of order), it was not as successful here. While the overall plot of Hillerman's book remains essentially intact, it was so heavily condensed, and at times moved so quickly, that the viewer was required to pay extremely close attention at the risk of missing something critical to understanding the story.

Like the previous reviewer, I like Adam Beach and Wes Studi in the respective roles of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Unfortunately, in an effort to popularize the characters for the viewing audience, the film makers have added some elements that just ring false: Joe Leaphorn as a victim of E.D.? Chee and Leaphorn as ""buddies"", as the film's ending implies? In Hillerman's books (yes, yes, I know I'm being a purist) there is some level of mutual respect between the two Navajo police officers, but it's the tension between the younger, traditionalist Chee, and the older, more modernist Leaphorn, that helps to propel the stories.

Overall, I rate ""A Thief of Time"" between the awful ""Skinwalkers"" and the rather better, more coherent, ""Coyote Waits"".",1092096000,50,1337,4.964285714285714
2075940,5,B0002CHJPA,I love the Hillerman books  . . sooooo  I thought these production from KPBS were very well represent how I imagined the how  the stories would appear  . . . especially the actors ...  they were pretty close how I saw the characters to appear like . . .

I hope I win soon as the actors are probably are did not stop aging . . .,1491868800,,435,3.7032967032967035
2075941,5,B0002CHJPA,"A well done visualization of Tony Hillerman's book.  I usually enjoy reading the novel first and then viewing the video/movie version.  Since I am somewhat familiar with context of the story (Chaco Canyon, the Navajo culture, and the San Juan river), I found that the video/movie matched what I imagined in first reading the novel.  The characterizations are well done by the actors.  Both the book and the video/movie are well worth you time!",1491782400,,443,4.945945945945946

2075950,5,B0002CHJPA,"The first PBS dvd I ordered, ""Skinwalkers"" had subtitles. A ""Thief of Time"" and ""Coyote Waits"" do not.

Even with my TV volume on full blast I couldn't understand most of it as I can't always separate voices from background noise and soundtracks. Very disappointed with PBS.",1459036800,2,356,4.758064516129032
2075951,1,B0002CHJPA,"Suffers the same fate as the other two films in that, while the visuals and acting are ok, the pace of this film is just so boring. PBS-quality boring. Plus the plot seemed to be all over the place (plus what was the deal with the ghosts?  I was expecting a Scooby-Do-style answer, but the film ends and you never figure out what Jim Chee saw.)  Another fault is that this film does a conserable mockery of Christians.  I can deal with some, but a little goes a long way, and this film went a little overboard.  The ending of this film was strange an unsatisfying.",1458259200,,564,4.2924528301886795

2075962,3,B0002CHJPA,"I enjoyed seeing native American actors playing Leaphorn and Chee,and the scenery was lovely--but I really disliked the gratuitous incident of the red-haired archeologist coming on to Leaphorn. which was totally cliched and unrealistic, as well as totally out of keeping with the spirit of the novels.  First, while in Mickey Spillane novels, dames are always all over the detective, they aren't in Hillerman novels, because, guess what, most nice looking women don't really going around throwing themselves at uninterested men. (I can't see why Hillerman, who was consulted on the script, allowed this)  Second, for an archeologist to have a doctorate and enough academic clout to get her own dig site, she'd have to be at least in her mid thirties--and if she was pretty, unprofessional, and single, she'd be more likely  to save her wiles for the chairman of her university's grants committee rather than going after middle-aged cops.
As for the ending, while academics can be spiteful and petty, they really don't go around killing each other over their research.  They may try to get one another denied tenure, prevent rival colleagues from getting grants, and write snarky reviews of one another's books, but they are really much more comfortable with words than bullets.  That's why they are academics in the first place.",1444521600,2,1328,5.12962962962963

2075965,4,B0002CHJPA,"I love the way the actors have fully embraced their characters and the chemistry between them is spot on. The story is intriguing with sudden twists, and the filming and setting is memorable. I'd say this was the best of the series except for some major, jarring flaws.

For one thing it opens with Gary Farmer, as Captain Largo, swearing a blue streak. Where did this come from? I don't recall this kind of language in Hillerman's books. Was this to combat the cynic's remaks that the Indians portrayed in this series were too nicey-nice and not raw and crude enough to be realistic? It felt in-your-face and unnecessary.

Then there's the actress who plays the redheaded archeologist (or is she an anthropologist? She's so busy flirting it's easy to lose track). The actress seems determined to steal the show from the main stars with all her mannerisms and hard sell. It was a toss-up whether I was more irritated or embarrassed. Whatever the case it always jarred me out of the story because she doesn't fit. Her role in the mystery is extremely minor, yet the focus is disproportionately on her. It took away from Leaphorn's wonderful, deep relationship with his wife and added nothing of merit.

The other jarring point was Graham Greene (I'm a fan of his) as the charismatic Christian minister. The idea, on the rez, is an incongruous enough one to be interesting, or it could have been humorous, but it felt as if Greene chewed the scenery and went waaaay over the top. Which, from such a wonderfully subtle actor, was more than a little disconcerting.

Everything else, though, was first rate and made me really wish they'd made the next Leaphorn/Chee mystery. Why didn't they?",1443139200,4,1686,4.763698630136986

2075975,4,B0002CHJPA,"The landscape in this movie was lovely and the plot was intriguing.  It revolves around two Navaho tribal police officers named Leaphorn and Chee.  Leaphorn is the veteran who is on leave due to his wifes health issues and, obviously, has a lot on his mind even as he is called back to investigate claims that an archeologist is illegally selling pots.  Chee, on the other hand, seems a rookie as he lets a backhoe get stolen and keeps driving vehicles into the ground as he chases his tail looking the for thieves.  Hes also very traditionalist and so very worried about this investigation as it brings him into burial grounds.  The two stories converge, of course, as the suspected archeologist goes missing, we find a local Christian Navaho preacher might be behind some of the pot selling (great job by a favorite of mine, Graham Greene), and what does this have to do with the ghosts of the dead and the mystery of the disappearance of the Anasazi anyway?

I enjoyed the feel of the movie, especially the hint of supernatural, but when it eventually became pretty much a straightforward murder mystery story, I found it not quite as engaging as in the beginning.  I also thought the subplot of one of the suspect archeologists hitting on Leaphorn didn't seem to add much to the overall story and was kind of annoying.  There also seemed to be a missing plot point as two murdered men were found, but (unless I missed it) they never told us the results of the autopsies and so what killed them, leaving their eyes dead-white.

But, overall, this was a very engaging movie and I didn't figure out who was behind it until the end, which is a plus.",1426118400,,1649,4.562711864406779

If you're interested in the Southwest, archaeology, the Navaho, stay away. The script trashes the novel's plot. The direction wastes some talented actors. The depiction of archaeologists, how they work, their values, is offensive. (As for the characters: Pretending Joe Leaphorn doesn't know stuff about his own people? And Jim Chee is an idiot? C'mon!)

I expect movies made from books to take some license with the story but....This is not even recognizable!! The characters are not anything like Hillerman's characters whom we have all learned to love and the story could not even be followed if you hadn't read Hillerman's version to fill in the blanks, and there were lots of them! I know these actors can all do much better so I don't  blame it on them.

2076029,4,B0002CHJPA,"The third of these PBS American Mystery specials produced by Robert Redford. They're all good, but this one is some easier to follow than the other two.

Young Navajo police officer Jim Chee (Adam Beach) and senior officer Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi) have two mysteries to solve, and they become locked together. One is a stolen backhoe that Jim is sent to investigate, and the other is a ""pot picker"" (person who steals ancient clay pots from Navajo land and sells them on the collector's market) that is Joe's responsibility. But when two people, a white man and an Indian, are found dead with the backhoe, it becomes clear that the archeologists working in the Anasazi ruins are involved.

A brief appearance by Peter Fonda, as Harrison Hauk, a Mormon farmer in the area who has an interesting history with Joe Leaphorn, is just one of the complications. And once again, I did not guess the ultimate outcome of the mystery. To me, that's the sign of a story well told, especially when I say ""I should have seen that"" after the truth is revealed.",1336694400,2,1045,4.643243243243243

2076031,5,B0002CHJPA,"Thief of Time is the 3rd of these PBS American Mystery dramas, produced by Robert Redford and based on the novels by Tony Hillerman.  The release dates of each drama are as follows:

Having recently purchased each of these through Amazon Marketplace I'm now inspired to explore the books for myself.  This title ""Thief of Time"" works well as a metaphor to reflect on interpersonal associations between the characters in all three dramas.

I love Adam Beach as Deputy Jim Chee, having also enjoyed his appearance  in the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windtalkers/dp/B00005JK8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windtalkers</a>&nbsp;with Nicholas Cage.  Oh, and did I mention his gregarious nature, a smile with halogen luminescence, and athletic build.  When we see his interactions with his girl friend Janet, a feisty Public Defender, it's clear his obligations are severely demanding.

Deputy Chee's living accommodations are Spartan from first appearances.  But this college educated (University of New Mexico) Medicine man(trained by Navajo Elders), follows a path of public service which means making himself available to all sorts of demands on his time.  No one can get close to him without literally bursting in on his other obligations, which makes for some great situational irony.

Regarding Detective Joe Leaphorn, he's a crusty, hard-nosed, non-talkative, no-nonsense investigator.  Joe is easier to respect than he is to like.  The relationship dynamic between Joe and his Navajo wife Emma is a delight to watch.  She's a more than patient, more than strong enough woman who puts up with his grouchiness and more.

As the various plots unfold, we're introduced to her ongoing battle as a cancer survivor.  When the first episode (Skinwalkers) has her passing through a room where Joe is researching the term ""Skinwalker,"" she jibes him,  ""Surfing for porn? Joe.""  (When she's joking.)

When he grunts, ""yeah, right,""  her total indifference to whatever he's looking at belies the depths of her trust and tolerance.  The fact he isn't porn surfing, and the fact that their efforts at intimacy collide with his erectile dysfunction during the third episode makes for extremely awkward conversation, after the fact, (comparing her totally different demeanor, when she's not joking.)  Even though it's not a joke, and necessarily sanitized for PBS, there's something strangely touching about a couple of adults struggling to discuss something so personal without actually naming it.  Without the trade names of big pharma (i.e. Viagra or Ciallis, etc.) it's just a bit pathological.

Altogether, the mysteries themselves are resolved.  The quirks of reservation gossip and the cinematography of stunningly beautiful Arizona desert landscapes are punctuated by crises shrouded in superstitious wonder.",1328140800,5,3383,6.507829977628635
2076032,4,B0002CHJPA,I really liked this version of Hillerman's book.  Once upon a time I lived in this area and the depiction of its characters is plausible.,1327536000,,137,4.48
2076033,3,B0002CHJPA,And another good Joe Leaphorn movie.  Incredible backdrop of the New Mexico and Arizona landscape.  Such great chemistry between the characters who appear in all or most of the Leaphorn movies.  Highly recommend.,1322438400,,212,5.363636363636363
2076034,3,B0002CHJPA,"This melodramatic film is passable but could have been much better. The major problem, as it often is with televised films, is with the script.  The story is confusing, with two subplots and flashbacks all going on at the same time.  The acting is fine with the exception of a red head playing an archaeologist (or is it anthropologist?) who smirks outrageously throughout her lines.  She could have a fine career on daytime soaps.

The leading feature in the film is the scenery.  That provides half a star on its own.  The rest...well, watch it after your brain has said goodnight.",1313625600,,583,4.7227722772277225
2076035,5,B0002CHJPA,"The story was kept intact and in iconological order.  However is suggest you read the book first or at the least are familiar with the characters first. There is only so much film time and this really needed to be a mini-series. Each character's background and personality was alluded to.  The visuals are par-exultant. You feel that you are in Four-corners territory.

The picked a perfect cast of actors. Most have played in other Hillerman book films, so you recognize the characters. I know you can look up the list but I still am amazed at how I immediately associate the characters with the characters. To name a few Wes Studi (Cherokee) as Joe Leaphorn, Sheila Tousey (Menominee and Stockbridge-Munsee Indian) as Emma Leaphorn, and Graham Greene (He is an Oneida Indian)as Slick Nakai.

This presentation follows the Hillerman formula for two intertwined mysteries that start for different purposes and sometimes end differently and not combined. On occasion Hillerman stories really do not end.  Jim Chee must track down a missing back-hoe that he let get pilfered from a secure compound. Joe Leaphorn must track down a suspected pot thief or a thief of time. One of their paths crossings is through a preacher appropriately named Slick. When the back-hoe user turns up dispatched and the pot thief is missing, they may find that the two stories are one.

We are quite lucky that the story did not get twisted by Robert Redford as he has his own agenda and quit often bends stories for his own purpose. In the movie ""Skinwalkers"" the Skinwalkers have been for all practical purposes removed. Robert Redford did the same thing is several other productions ruining the whole purpose of the story. Yet hear he seemed to take a more hands off approach so it played well.

The DVD has a good voice over commentary and the standard other extras.",1301616000,3,1847,4.825949367088608
2076036,4,B0002CHJPA,"My husband and I are Hillerman fans and looked forward to seeing the filming of his stories. When living with a Navaho woman, many years ago, I learned a great deal of Navaho culture and enjoyed seeing essences of it filmed. We enjoyed all three films and wish more had been made.  The scenery was beautiful; the acting great; and the special features were informative. We highly reccommend all three films.",1278374400,2,407,4.732394366197183
2076037,5,B0002CHJPA,I am a TONY HILLERMAN fan and this movie was great. WES STUDI plays a great joe leaphorn .,1276646400,,90,3.789473684210526
2076038,2,B0002CHJPA,"The movie adaption is not up to the high standards set by Hillerman's novel [Novel gets a 5-star]. It had the elements to make it a good movie - great story, great actors and the most beautiful setting in the world, the Southwest.

But they botched it up- bad direction and screenplay. The deviations from the original story (not major) and the additions were not needed. The scenes are incoherent and some left unexplained. Some of the dialogs are plain stupid, for instance - Emma shows up at Janet's apartment at 5 am looking concerned. And Janet says ""This is not a good time"". In the end it appears as if Leaphorn did not solve the case at all (different from novel).

The pluses - Authentic locations (except at Chaco). Good acting by Studi and Beach. The movie does a decent job of showing the Navajo life on reservation, being somewhat true to the novel. And if you are bored of watching NYPD, CSI-Miami etc. etc., the Navajo Tribal Police Dept comes as a refreshing change.",1266105600,6,982,4.573863636363637
2076039,4,B0002CHJPA,"I just finished the book a Thief of Time and then watched the movie. I really had to let go of the book in order to sit back and enjoy the movie(and also for my partner too, since I kept saying ""but that is not right""). The characters were great depsite some changes. One for instance that kept bugging me on and off throughout the movie was Jim Chee. This is not the Jim Chee in the books...this Jim is more naive, innocent, lacks some of self responsiblity that he has in the books and much more talkative. Jim 'talks' a lot in the books..but that is because we are in his head but he is less talkative to people. He waits. He is patient. He listens. He is observant. These are not traits found in the Jim Chee in the movie.

 Plus, Joe and Chee have a respectful, guarded, but not really like each other relationship at this point in the series. In the movie,  Chee is thinks the world of Joe and likes him quite a bit.

I know it doesn't sound like, I enjoyed the movie..but I did. I am just sharing that it might be best to let go of what you have read in the books...to enjoy the film.",1263081600,7,1091,4.08411214953271
2076050,5,B0002CHJPA,Great movie based on the book by Tony Hillerman. We Studi and Adam Beach make a great Chee/Leaphorn team.,1242864000,,105,4.578947368421052
2076051,4,B0002CHJPA,"Very rarely do movies catch a book's essence but in this case a thief in time does just that. While it can not capture all of the principal characters or go into the details of the book, this movie does a great job at providing suspense, drama and a well thought out plot.  The acting is top notch with Adam Beach and Wes Studi not only filling the roles from the book above all expectations, they also have an on screen chemistry that makes their role even more believable.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who liked the late, great Tony Hillerman and hope that PBS makes more of them in the future.",1235606400,,605,4.298245614035087

2076053,4,B0002CHJPA,"Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi) is on leave when the dispatcher calls him back.  What's the big case?  He's to serve a warrant on an archeologist who's taken pots from Navajo land. The problem is, he can't find her and none of her co-workers appear to be very helpful.

Meanwhile, Jim Chee (Adam Beach) has problems of his own coming from all sides.  He got distracted from security duty and a rather large piece of tribal equipment was stolen.  Just as he sees the thieves, he wrecks his girlfriend's BMW convertible.

As the bodies begin to pile up, Leaphorn and Chee realize that they have some issues in common with their cases and reluctantly team up. Will they find the archeologist in time to save her life?  And will the woman's work uncover the mystery of the lost Anasazi?

""Thief of Time"" was originally produced for PBS.  It's based on the Tony Hillerman novel by the same name and produced by Chris Eyre, who's done ""Smoke Signals"" and other great Native American films.  If you just watch the film for the scenery, it's worth it.  Add the mystery to it, and you've got a great show.

2076058,3,B0002CHJPA,"Personally, I found this film ... out of the current films based on Tony Hillerman's books the best of the films!  However, I suggest anyone thinking about buying ... and not having seen any of the 3 films released to date ... (see these films first) ... otherwise you maybe dissapointed.

  I have seen all 3 films ... and, have read the other reviews here posted which I might add, all have valid pro's & con's about made about this film that are helpful. They do not though mention how this film breaks out -of the box- compared to the others, in that it uses a HISTORICAL angle in it's script touching on the 'Anasazi culture' and 'Chaco Canyon' which was refreshing to me ... in that I find history interesting especially in relation to Native American Indian history.

  (If you feel the same way, and think you might like one of the Hillerman based movies mentioned in reviews here - this maybe the one out of the 3 movie/DVDs for you).  Then again you may not want any of -or- want all of them?",1133136000,9,1002,4.378378378378378
2076059,2,B0002CHJPA,"I have read each and every Tony Hillerman mystery and thoroughly enjoyed each one.  Likewise, I eagerly awaited this DVD, A Thief of Time.  Unfortunately, I cannot say anything very good about it.  Unlike the many (read British) PBS series that have dramatized great detective novels into entertaining movies, this installment in the initial ""American Mystery"" series is a hopeless dud.

Tony Hillerman writes a rich, vivid novel in the nuance of the Navajo culture.  His details and characters are too much for a 93 minute DVD to digest.  Scenes flit around in small one and three minute sequences, disjointed and disorganized.  Hillerman's plot device of having parallel plot lines join at the end create too many complexities for a rushed presentation.

I deeply regret the disservice to a wonderful author and mystery novel, and frankly wish I could say something more positive.  Well....let's try...the Four Corners scenery is beautiful.",1116892800,15,942,5.226666666666667
