7852381,4,6303562973,"I enjoyed this volume on Best of Beavis and Butthead but there was one pretty obvious episode that was missing. ""Babes R Us""!!! Come on, it's pretty predictable. Remember the episode when Beavisand butthead try and see Chick Mud Wrestling. I would pick that episode over ""Friday Night"". That's why I subtracted 1 star from this volume. The episode I enjoyed was ""Naked Colony"", a season 3 episode. This volume deserves 2 thumbs up, though.",1100908800,2,439,4.866666666666666
7852382,5,6303562973,"Friday Night(A-)-Good ep from the b's glory days.  Here, the b's meet up with a biker lady at the Maxi Mart.  Hilite when Butthead wonders if the biker lady ""does it"".
Naked Colony(A)-Better than the first.  Here, the b's try to get into a nudist colony for free.  Hilite when we see what happens inside Butthead's reproductive system.
1-900-Beavis(A-)-Not as good as the last, but a very good ep.  Here the b's call a phone sex line and almost start their own.  Hilite when the phone sex operator puts the phone on her rear as the b's tell her to do.
Party(B)-Good ep, but weak compared to the last 3.  Here, the b's try to hold a wild party, but get thrown out by Todd.  Hilite when the B's try to impress Todd with their hard stuff.
Top O The Mountain(A)-Stronger ep than the ones before it.  Here, the b's go get their hair washed so they can see the stylist's [anatomy].  Hilite when the b's sit there chuckling and whispering after ""climbing the mountain"".
Plastic Surgin(B-)-Good, but one of the weaker eps.  Here, the b's get nose enlargements, thinking they got weiner enlargements.  Hilite when Butthead asks the nurse if the plastic surgeon works on ""bones"", assuming she knows what he means.
Pregnant Pause(A)-Very strong ep.  Here, Beavis thinks he's pregnant after seeing pregnant women on TV and at the Maxi Mart.  Hilite when Butthead tells Beavis he looks pregnant after he stuffs a pregnancy test in his shirt.
Dream On(B+)-Great ep, tho not as good as it could have been.  Here, the b's have dreams inspired by TV programming.  Hilite when the b's have a Brady Bunch dream.
Vidiots(A-)-An improvement over the last ep.  Here, the b's try a dating service.  Hilite when the b's cancel each other's chances(possibly their only)to score.
All n all, I give this tape an A-",1041638400,6,1787,4.654952076677317
7852383,5,6303562973,"...this is the boys first great video. Full of laugh out loud episode and great jokes this one is a keeper.
-Friday Night(B), the boys stop by Maxi Mart to pick up chicks and a end up meeting a cool biker lady. This is the only old episode on this tape. The humor is alright but I perfer the sequel this episode inspired, Another Friday Night.
-Naked Colony(B), Beavis and Butthead are bummed when they learn its $4,000.00 to join Sunny grove nudist colony so they decide to break in instead. Another alright episode with some good humor. The best part of this ep is the look on their faces when they see all the naked people.
-1-900-Beavis(A-), after seeing an erotic add on tv the boys decide to call a phone sex line... A very fuuny episode. I laughed when the identity of the women with the sexy voice was reveiled and when they asked her to put the phone on her [rear].
-Party(B-), the boys decide to throw a party. Things start off slow when Stewart and his friends show up, but eventually Todd shows up to liven up the party. This is the only ok episode. Not much happens and there wasn't too many funny moments.
-Top O'The Mountain(B+), Beavis and Butthead go get their hair cut by a very sexy lady. A good episode. I love the look on their faces as they stare at the girls breats and Beavis' impression of Woody Woodpecker is a gut buster as well.
-Plastic Surgin(B), the boys see a doctor to get winner implants but instead get their noses enlarged. This one has plenty Boooing, booing, from Beavis and some funny jokes as well.
-Pregnant Pause(A+), Beavis tries to cope with the fact that he might be pregnant. This is one of the funniest episdodes ever, I laughed so hard it hurt. Beavis' reactions to being pregnant are hystyrical and the music the accompanies it adds a lot too. When Beavis thinks he is getting contractions I had tears in my eyes, from laughing so hard. Classic.
-Dream On(A), the boys decide to skip school and sleep and have some very interesting dreams. A very solid and funny episode. My favorite dream would have to involve the Brady Bunch girls but they are all funny. Beavis' dreams show him kicking [rear], while Butthead's show him scoring.
Vidiots(B+), Beavis and Butthead decide to make dating tapes to meet girls. A good ep. This episode is actually the closest they have ever gotten to scoring, if they weren't so stupid they would have lost their virginity, because there are girls in this episode willing to sleep with them.
A very solid video that newcommers and hardcore fans of Beavis and Butthead should both enjoy. The Preganant Pause episode is worth the $[money] alone.",1017705600,12,2623,4.559322033898305
7852384,1,6303562973,"True Beavis and Butthead are not role modles, but they are not suppose to be. I watched some episode of them on Mtv, but found them boring. They don't do anything,the jokes are all the same, and there is no plot. Mike's second cartoon called King of the Hill is funnier. South Park may be worse than Beavis and Butthead, but it is  a lot funnier. At least Matt and Trey do different jokes",978480000,,388,4.243243243243243

The previous person that made comments to the effect that they are showing our kids what true role models people have in the US can stay in Canada and freeze their feable mind away.
