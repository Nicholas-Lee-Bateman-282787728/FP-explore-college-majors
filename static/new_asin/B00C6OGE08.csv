8625040,1,B00C6OGE08,"First off, famoudou is The best. Its is a pleasure to see him at home working on drums and hanging out& teaching. That said, this video SUCKS. It is like watching a poorly edited home movie. I don't think there's a full (uncut) song on the whole thing, and for most of the concert portion the sound does not line up with the picture, making it unwatchable. Do not buy this, buy famoudou's albums or attend his work shops.",1431302400,,421,4.341772151898734
