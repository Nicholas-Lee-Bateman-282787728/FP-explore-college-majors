536233,1,6303042503,"Well, X-Men 5 was...acceptable. Passable. Serviceable. Mechanical. Dry. Melodramatic. Lacking weight. Lacking heart. Lacking. Disappointing. Tired.

Not to lay the First Class comparisons on thick, but I'm going to lay them on thick. X4 walked a magic divide between torture and whimsy. Like having a Daredevil/Spider-Man team-up movie and it miraculously working. We could have training montages, self-aware wit and 60's flare at the same time we had Nazis, the coin sequences, and a scene that managed to evoke 9/11 without belaboring it. One of my favorite teachers said the best things straddle the fence betwixt being really great and really terrible, because that's where the risks are, that's where the power is. It's how X4 can be a melodramedy without feeling lopsided.

X5 is a morose, sour-faced affair, lacking the banter between Charles and Erik and replacing it with meaninglessly overused hollywords like ""hope,"" ""believing in yourself,"" ""we can choose to be better people,"" blah blah blah the children are our future oh god just end it. It is a long two hours of grim-looking people yelling and moping and crying. So stacked with cameos that it's as if characters are just items on a checklist rather than lenses through which to process a narrative.

X5 also unwinds the rich grey areas that were the meat of X4's ending. We understood why Erik was angry, we understood why in the most richly uncomfortable and challenging way that terrorism and genocide made sense for him, and we loved him still. We understood why Charles walked the path of diplomacy, activism, bureaucracy and patience. Neither were wrong. (What the new Star Wars trilogy managed to brush up against re: the Sith and the Jedi in its very brief moments of clarity.) But X5 decides, nope, we'll have the right side over here and the wrong side over here and the latter should feel bad. Bad wrong side, bad, your way couldn't possibly make sense under any circumstances. For shame.

Also, X-Men movies have jokes. More than a dozen, even. I know, what a mystery, a novelty, that we could smile with these characters as well as struggle with them. Quicksilver steals X5's thunder by promising a movie that it will never be. A movie of lively music, nuanced and well-communicated action scenes, comedy, and writing that gives the performer a damn thing to work with. Every movie these days wants to be darker and edgier, but what's wrong with warmth? Star Trek, Superman, Transformers, everybody trades everything in for the biggest and most creative body count. ""Oh your movie only killed 10 million people? Mine had ten trillion deaths! We destroyed half the universe, because we're hardcore, and nothing gets the blood pumping like little CG ants swallowed by flames in screaming agony.""

X5 isn't as bad as X3, it's certainly more focused. It knows where it's going. But when we get there, why do we care? I still think about that last X4 scene with Kevin Bacon. The silence in his frozen face. Petrified menace. The slow, so very slow, way that it ends. But nothing about X5's ending is something you can take home with you. Nothing holds a mirror up to you and asks ""Who are you? What do you want?""

X5 is safe. A waste. It isn't bad, it's worse than just being bad. It had a wealth of actors, mythology and money to tell something as fresh as the story it was based on, and instead we have something that is simply fine. It's fine, really. Just fine.

If you need a great superhero movie, see Unbreakable or X4 or Winter Soldier. If you need a great time travel tale, Back to the Future, The Terminator, Run Lola Run, Primer, Looper, Star Trek IV or 1960's Time Machine. If you need a great use of a large cast, Margin Call, Steel Magnolias, Magnolia, Ocean's Eleven or a Tarantino. If you need a Singer directorial masterwork, The Usual Suspects. If you need something penned by Kinberg, Sherlock Holmes. But unless you need a get in, get out, sci-fi action film with the staying power of a sneeze, you don't need this.",1400803200,40,4010,4.769452449567724
536234,4,6303042503,"The culmination of 14 years, 7 movies and an almost insurmountable number of continuity issues, this latest mutant adventure takes the smart approach by  well  ignoring most of them.

Directed by Bryan Singer (his first X-Men film since X2: X-Men United in 2003), this movie attempts to go the Avengers route by mashing up the two disparate X-Men movie universes  the original trilogy, which started in 2000s X-Men (anchored by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, Professor X and Magneto, respectively) and the new prequel universe, launched in 2011s X-Men: First Class (anchored by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Professor X and Magneto).  How they get there is a matter of ridiculous time travel, the type that only comic books, and now, comic book movies, could accept with a straight face. Take a deep breath, its a lot to take in.

Heres the premise: its sometime around (roughly) 2025  the X-Men we came to know and love in the original trilogy have their backs up against the wall. Mutants  and human sympathizers  have been systematically killed off by mutant hunting robots, called Sentinels, and only a loose rag tag bunch of X-Men remain as the final force against pure mutant elimination. This group of X-Men, co-lead by life-long enemies Professor Xavier and Magneto, includes such mutants as Iceman, Kitty Pride, Storm, and the ageless Wolverine (plus some newbies, like obscure fan favorites such as Bishop and Blink).  Apparently, at some point, Kitty Pride gained the ability to send ones consciousness into the past. This ability has been used to send mutants back hours, or days, at a time to prep for Sentinel onslaughts, but Xavier and Magneto have a bigger plan  send someone back to when it all started  1973.

Apparently, in 1973, Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Sentinel inventor Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), and his murder set off the production of these Sentinels, leading to decades of death and destruction. So  now they need to send someone back to the 70s to end this before it happens  and who better to send back than the man whos outlived them all, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, in his seventh appearance as the character).

Ultimately, the toughest decision of how to mix these films would be in the execution  writer Simon Kinberg had no easy choice in figuring out the path to go  this film could easily be seen as X-Men 4, First Class 2 or even Wolverine 3  and thankfully, they decided to follow the freshest path, making Days of Future Past a proper sequel to the breath of fresh air known as X-Men: First Class.

Much how First Class did a fantastic job bringing the X-Men to the 1960s, with a clear spy influence (and James McAvoys fantastic mutant swinger take on a young Xavier), Days of Future Past brings the younger X-Men cast into the darker 1970s. Were in a post Vietnam world, Xavier is strung-out on a drug that allows him to walk again (but subdues his power), and many of the X-Men in training were killed, or lost to the Vietnam war.

The movie focuses mostly on a core cast of McAvoys Xavier, Fassbenders Magneto, Jackman as Wolverine, Jennifer Lawrences Mystique, Dinklage as Trask andweirdly, Nicholas Hoults Beast. Even with as many of the continuity questions that will leave the nerds rambling (I cant wait to see the insufferable Movie Mistakes video that comes out of this), the movie never feels slow or bogged down by the size of its ambition. Instead, X-Men: Days of Future Past focuses on what always made X-Men such a fun comic to read  the drama of the interaction between its characters.  Theres loss of unspoken love, death, destruction, betrayal and confusion here, and its absolutely riveting.

That isn't to say that the movie is without action  the Sentinels, both in their 1970s and 2020s forms  are remarkable forces of destruction, and the future in particular is home to some great action sequences  you can tell the filmmakers had particular joy with Blinks Portal-esq teleporting ability. That said, it speaks volumes that some of the most engrossing work involves character moments between McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence. I realize, with two Oscar nominated actors (one winner!) in the mix, that shouldnt be surprising, but in an era of summer movies filled with city leveling destruction, I applaud the restraint.

The biggest surprise of the film, however? Quicksilver (Evan Peters). Understandably maligned prior to the release of the movie, due to his costuming and the me too! nature of his addition, post Avengers 2 announcements, the X-Men version of the mutant speedster is an absolute joy to watch. Less is definitely more with this character, as he ultimately only appears in one major sequence in the film, but his moments are memorable and long lasting. Joss Whedon and crew have a lot to live up to with their version of the character now, and I never thought Id be saying that. This version of Quicksilver will have everyone talking when they leave the theater.

X-Men: Days of Future Past is a movie that could have been crushed by the scope of its ambition, but by drawing back the urges to make a superhero film that could be lumped into the rest, and standing on the shoulders of its incredibly talented cast, it ends up as an absolute success  in the most unexpected ways. I hope we get to see the McAvoy/Fassbender/Lawrence grouping lead this franchise for years to come. A very high recommendation.

POST CREDIT NOTES: There is indeed a post-credits scene in X-Men: Days of Future Past, and youll have to wait through the full credits to get it. No mid-credit nonsense here.",1400803200,6,5591,4.866033755274262
536235,5,6303042503,"The X-Men  at least in comparison to other comic book characters, like Batman, Spider-Man, or The Avengers, have never been the most popular heroes on the block.  Sure, theyve enjoyed a great deal of box office success, grossing $2.3 billion with six films, yet not one of those films generated the sort of overwhelming interest youd expect from comic book movies.  If anything, the one major takeaway from the X-Men franchise is the propulsion of Hugh Jackmans acting career (which now appears to be slowly shying away from the Wolverine character thats made him so undeniably popular).  But, in the aftermath of Marvels The Avengers, superhero group movies are becoming all the rage  prompting the biggest group team-up film to date in X-Men: Days of Future Past.

PLEASE BE AWARE THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR PLOT SPOILERS  IT WONT RUIN THE MOVIE FOR YOU, BUT IT WILL DETAIL THE EVENTS.

Byran Singer returns to the directors chair to helm the prequel/sequel, Days of Future Past  which features an all-star cast, including Hugh Jackman as the mutant, Wolverine.  In a dystopian future dominated by mutant (and human) seeking robots, called Sentinels, the remaining members of the X-Men  including Wolverine, Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), and a handful of others, reach the conclusion that in order to avert this desolate future, they must send one of their own back in time to make a drastic change to the timeline.

The change in question is the assassination of an industrial scientist, Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage).  In the past, believing she was doing the best of mutant-kind, Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) killed Trask, but in the process ended up being captured by the government.  Her DNA led to the creation of an adaptive and nearly impervious sentinel program that eventually wiped out the majority of both mutants and humans.  In order to prevent this assassination of Trask, Kitty Pryde praises Wolverines futuristic mind back in time to his younger body in the 1970s.

Once there, Wolverine approaches a youthful, drugged-out and wayward Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), with the hope of convincing him, along with Beast (Nicholas Hoult), to help stop Mystique from carrying out her assassination plot.  However, they also require the help of the angry master of magnetism, Magneto (Michael Fassbender), who is currently incarcerated for murder.  However, breaking Magneto out of prison is a dangerous maneuver that may in fact come back to haunt the X-Men, and inadvertently create a worse future than the one already dominated by the Sentinels.

Days of Future Past is arguably the greatest X-Men comic book storyline ever told (depending who you ask, of course)  so, naturally, the film adaptation comes with a high amount of expectation.  Truthfully, its difficult to balance the excitement and anticipation leading up to the film with the initial reaction following its viewing.  But, its fairly easy to say that its the best X-Men film in the entire franchise (which is definitely saying something, especially since X2 was such a strong film).  A few of the previous X-Men installments (mostly The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine) left a bad taste in the mouths of fans (present company included)  and even strong outings from The Wolverine and X-Men: First Class were not enough to quench the thirst for a stronger X-Men movie.

Nevertheless, Days of Future Past is all it should have been and more  combining characters from the original trilogy with the new class.  Though the story is time travel oriented, its not one of those tales that will leave your head spinning with all of its twists and turns.  Screenwriter Simon Kinberg manages to balance a complex storyline with the inclusion of several high-profile Hollywood stars.  Director Bryan Singer, who did a tremendous job on the first two X-Men films before leaving the franchise, proves he should be the only individual allowed to direct the franchise (though his current personal issues may make that an issue in the future).  Hes able to perfectly blend the old characters with the new characters, and properly allots screen time to the point that you don't feel as though any of the main players are short-changed.

The Wolverine is still the commanding character that he always been, and its indisputable how vital Hugh Jackman is to the franchise.  Much like his career, Jennifer Lawrence has, in similar fashion, propelled herself into one of Hollywoods highly coveted actresses, which worked out perfectly since Mystique is the real main antagonist of the Days of Future Past comic book storyline.  Her onscreen chemistry is at its peak anytime shes involved with Michael Fassbenders Magneto.  The dynamic between these two characters is one obviously filled with anger, affection  possibly even an unrequited love.  Hopefully future X-Men films will delve deeper into their unique relationship.

James McAvoy, Nicholas Hoult, and Peter Dinklage are just as compelling in their respective roles, but outside of them, the film is filled with little more than overextended cameos from Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and a variety of other familiar faces.  And, I won't lie  I was happy to see the roles of Halle Berry and Anna Paquin reduced to next to nothing.  Honestly, their severely diminished screen time allowed for a newcomer, like Evan Peters (as Quicksilver), to steal the show  using his characters quippy one-lines, eye-popping super power, and fresh plot involvement to create a new fan favorite.  Comic fans know hes the son of Magneto  so Quicksilvers remark to Magneto about his mother knowing a guy that could control metal is a fanboys easter egg delight.  His involvement in future X-Men films is a must!

Overall, X-Men: Days of Future Past is arguably as good as Marvels The Avengers  meaning its in the conversation for the best comic book film to date.  From start to finish, this prequel/sequel never falters or loses its direction  keeping its focus on the goal at hand instead of losing itself to character domination.  The storyline deviated slightly from the comic book story, using different characters in modified roles  yet the concept remains the same (though Wolverine's classic comic book death scene is greatly missed in this film form).  The stars are aplenty, the action is effective, and this is simply a flat-out awesome summer blockbuster.  Best of all, the end result gives the X-Men franchise the Star Trek alternative timeline treatment, meaning the possibilities for future stories is limitless  and without restriction.  In essence, the future of the X-Men franchise has never looked so bright.

P.S.  Dont miss out on the scene after the credits, which introduces the villain of the next film, Apocalypse.  The sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse, hits theaters in May 2016.

536236,3,6303042503,"This indestructible franchise keeps adding new (very appealing) blood, and they keep selling tickets. This particular cast is noteworthy because of the quality of this new blood. Unfortunately, in my opinion, this is the most noteworthy part of this one: the script isn't particularly strong, the Computer Generated blowie uppie stuff is endless and the effort to exceed the previous episode is strained. Furthermore, this PG-13 outing is over two hours long, so watch your liquid intake.

In a nutshell, someone must travel back in time to prevent the origin of the creatures that are destroying mankind (and Mutants) in the opening (endlessly) violent sequence. This one really does start with a BANG!

We see:
  * Patrick Stewart (""X-Men"") is Xavier, the inspiration for the Mutants. He is no longer strong enough to endure the rigors of time travel.
  * Ian McKellen (""X-Men"") is Magneto, whose history with Xavier is key.
  * Michael Fassbender (""X-Men"") is the young Magneto; the scriptwriters went over the top with his abilities this time: he picks up a Washington D.C. sports stadium and drops it around the White House.
  * Hugh Jackman (""X-Men"") Everyone knows Wolverine! And of course he's the one Mutant tough enough to travel back to the 60s, recognize the music (we did too), and inspire Xavier to get his stuff together and save the world.
  * Nicholas Hoult (""X-Men"") is a sort of valet/enabler for a dissolute 1960s Xavier.
  * Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones"") is Trask, the fellow who needs Raven/Mistique's DNA for his evil schemes.
  * Jennifer Lawrence (""American Hustle"") is Raven/Mistique; she doesn't understand who is the real enemy and how the Mutants must eliminate the problem.

I could keep going because the list is endless, but you get the idea. In my opinion, there isn't much more to say; each character has his or her ""moment"" to shine and we know Good will prevail, so it's just a matter of watching all that nicely crafted blowie uppie stuff until it does.

(a brief guide to the story's outline)
Earth of tomorrow has been laid to waste by the unstoppable 'Sentinel-Robots' who have hunted down 'Mutants'
and Humans' alike.
'Charles' and indeed 'Eric' have assembled a team to try and find a way to change the events of 1973 where it had
all began, and to try to save the future of both 'Mutants' and 'Mankind' alike.
In 1973 the presence and actions of 'Mistique' shaped what was to come, she tried to kill 'Doctor Trask' who is
heading a campaign to rid the world of 'Mutants' by creating the 'Sentinel-Robots' the D.N.A of 'Mistique' if captured
could be used to enhance the ability of the robots to counter anything the Mutants could throw at them.
Because of his ability to regenerate his injured cells when damaged only 'Logan' could be sent back that far in time with
the special new-found teleporting skills possessed by 'Kitty'
Back in 1973 he returns to where he would have been at that time, though now, as his future self, he has to gather the
support of the then young'Charles' of in the hope of gathering enough support to change the future, 'Logan' has to convince
'Charles' that he had been sent back by him from the future, and the urgency of the mission he was there for.
They will need the help of 'Charles's' former friend 'Eric'(Magneto) who is held prisoner in 'The Pentagon' to achieve this
they will need the special skills of 'Peter/Quick Silver'
When together rumblings of what the future holds between 'Charles' and 'Eric' are simmering as they , 'Charles' wanting
a way to co-exist with human kind, 'Eric' wanting to rule them, for now they have tp put aside their differences for the
futures sake.
Can 'Mistique' be prevented from carrying out her historic mission, or can negotiation and reasoning prevent a bleak future
for both the 'Mutants' and 'Human-Kind' will 'Logan's' mission into the past succeed.
This is a superb X-Men offering that should not be missed if you have followed the series in recent years.
Again 'Marvel' brings an enjoyable visual-spectacle to the screen, with awesome special effects.........great picture and sound
quality throughout.( Great 3-D )

536748,5,6303042503,"Great movie!  While the timeline/events of the X-Men movies changes and rearranges based on retcons and revamps, this movie is pretty darn good.  I have a bit of a soft spot for X-Men: First Class as my all-time favorite of the movies, and this one isn't quite as good, but it's well made and has some very nice special effects and action sequences.  It's a pretty good follow-up to the emotional character development of Charles, Erik, Raven and Hank that we get in First Class, showing where their relationships have led them in the next decade or so.  While it lacks the heartwrenching moments of their backstories, it does show a little bit more of what makes those characters into the mutants that we all know and love.

As said above, the effects are good, especially those of some of the newly introduced mutants.  Blink, in particular, had quite pretty sequences, and everything with Quicksilver had me practically dying laughing when I wasn't glued to the screen in amazement at his action shots.  Evan Peters was wonderful, and Peter Dinklage gave another brilliant performance.  The score and soundtrack choices were great, and the script was well-written.  All in all, it was a pretty good movie, and definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the X-Men franchise.",1500681600,,1277,4.821100917431193

Very few sequels even meet the standard set forth by their predecessor. Some even exceed the original (in my opinion ""Terminator 2"" eclipses ""The Terminator"" on several levels). But, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" outshines all the X-Men films to date - including the follow-up ""Apocalypse"". I'm able to ignore the political agenda messages planted throughout the film to enjoy a story about redemption. All through the film, there are truly top-notch performances from all the people involved. From actors to directors to grips, they all produced a film that may not be exceeded within its universe. The tales of sadness, loss and longing are compelling and beautifully executed. I love how the ending happily restores the characters of the original film.",1494720000,,774,5.241935483870968

Objectionable Content
Violence: Heavy. Mostly bloodless the most violent scenes are reserved for those set in the future where sentinels kill mutants by choking, crushing, impaling, pulling them apart or even burning them. One mutant causes victims to wretch/vomit while another inflicts instant disease. Wolverine uses his claws to stab some mobsters and people killed are usually hit by bullets, one of whom is shot directly to the head, while others are victims of collateral damage from debris and crashes. Hand-to-hand fighting, often tame by comparison, is still rough.
Autopsy photos with head shots of the deceased who had been experimented on is also shown. The decaying remains of many are seen near futuristic death camps, while dead mutant bodies are callously dumped from trucks as though they weren't even people anymore. This is eerily reminiscent of how the Nazis treated the Jewish people during World War II and clearly an intended similarity is implied.
Sex/Nudity: Moderate. The most graphic scene involves Logan getting up out of bed, where he is seen nude from the back. The girl waking up next to him is in her underwear, and the camera lingers on her breasts which fairly spill out of her bra. Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), when she is not assuming a disguise, appears to be nude, while the actress is actually wearing a full bodysuit sparingly covered by scales. Scenes with her in this form are pretty frequent.
Language: Moderate. Curses included; a**h*** 3xs, s*** 4xs (once just mouthed), hell 2xs, piss off and screw___ are heard once each, but the Lords name was taken in vain six times and there is, annoyingly, one F word, as allowed by the MPAA for a PG-13 movie. There is also sexually suggestive dialog, including someone ordering to Raven, Clothes off!
Based on the triple threat of violence, nudity and language, I strongly encourage parents not to take their children and should state that though teens will be seeing this film it is not appropriate for them either.
Darwinism: Evolution is discussed as fact, not the theory that it is and motivates the central villain Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) just as it influenced thinking in Nazi Germany. Dogmatic science such as this does not allow consideration of God who is noticeably absent from the script. A good examination on this widespread ideological bias is Ben Steins movie Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.
Lessons
When Xavier is forced to choose between being able to walk or being able to save his friend, we have no doubt what his choice will be. This is mindful of what our Lord himself told us we all have to do.
If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. Mark 8:34
Realizing everything they do may not alter the future, one character asks, What are we destined for? This helpless, virtually hopeless feeling reminded me that the Word of God speaks about the fate of us all, and particularly those who have chosen to look to false gods for a bright and eternal future.
For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on Earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ Philippians 3:18-20
Xavier is trying to encourage someone when he says, Just because someone stumbles, loses their way, doesnt mean they are lost forever. One of the clearest parables about this is concerns the prodigal son found in the Gospel of Luke. In this parable the son claims his inheritance, moves away and sinfully squanders his fortune only to return offering to serve his father rather than to continue feeding strangers pigs. Instead of being harsh to the now repentant son, his father, a type of God our father in Heaven, rejoices. That is how God looks upon us when we come back to him after losing our way.
Intriguing storyline, great special effects, fascinating characters and conflict galore make X-Men: Days of Future Past perhaps the best X-Men film to date and definitely a cut above some of the earlier sequels. Keep in mind that the time travel component makes it skew more science fiction than its predecessors. A serious, dark movie, with few light moments, it still manages to pay homage to the X-Men canon and captivate its audience. I recommend this to fans of the genre, but warn again about the age sensitive material. Meant for mature audiences, this film may offend discerning Christians.",1486771200,,4878,4.84311377245509

538842,4,6303042503,"A fun romp through the (cinematic version of the) history of the X-Men, with the usual ""Oh, WOW!"" level special effects and a cast who seem to actually have some respect for their characters.

I kept the 5th star in my pocket due to a couple of small but annoying plot holes, the apparent ease with which some characters seem to suddenly agree with Logan/Wolverine, and a depiction of Magneto's power at a level that stretched my willing suspension of disbelief pretty hard. (This in a film where my only reaction to the powers of Blink, Raven/Mystique, Storm, et al was a happy smile... oh, well.)  Also, anyone not familiar with a number of the featured characters will likely spend several minutes going, ""Wait, what...?!?"" at the beginning of the film and maybe also 2-3 times as the story unfolds.

The reproduction of 1970s NYC and Washington, DC, although imperfect, were more than good enough to be plenty of fun; the same goes for Nixon & co. There are just enough intentionally silly/funny moments throughout the film to keep the dark side of the story where it belongs, and while the ending may be a tad too neat & clean for some fans I found it logical & satisfying.",1472947200,2,1178,4.626794258373206

539067,1,6303042503,"This is really a comment on Amazon and the digital service rather than on the movie (which was decent. I'd give it 3.5 out of 5).

I received an email asking me to rate this movie. I ""bought"" it a long time ago, but just watched it again, which means they're tracking my usage. I'm not like the millennials who just shrug their shoulders and say 'there is no privacy anymore'. I'm not keen on people monitoring, spying, watching, or ""collecting data"" on me. My Blu-ray player does not do that (yet). I also came to realize during a recent ISP outage that my Blu-rays, DVDs, and yes, even VHS tapes (along with books, etc.) still work when my internet connection is down (fine, it won't work when the power is out, although that can be remedied with a generator). But I can't use any digital service obviously. And, as I understand it, these digital movie purchases have an expiration date. You lose access after some period of time. It may be 20 years, but I have plenty of videos that are that old on my shelf. They may not be the latest and greatest technology, but no one is taking them away from me. I don't know how long it will take a Blu-ray disc to degrade, but I'm betting I'll have them for a long time, longer than I'm getting from these digital services anyway. And since the cost is usually about the same, as much as I hate a) having more ""things"" stacking up around the house, and b) ultimately contributing more to landfills, Amazon and these other digital services seem to be forcing my hand to physical discs.",1470873600,,1527,4.414893617021277

X probably didn't know what was going on, if so he would have tried to stop it.  So it was more on Magneto leadership, that probably lead to their death.",1470268800,,536,4.494845360824742

539361,5,6303042503,"Hope and nostalgia describe the latest X-Men flick to hit cineplexes. Fans of the comics patiently awaited this film, desperately wanting to love it after the debacle that was X3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Last summer, they received a bit of a reprieve with The Wolverine, but it still was not the X-Men. Bryan Singers prodigal return to the genre that would eventually birth Iron Man, Captain America and The Avengers does not disappoint as X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST becomes the perfect bookend to what he started 16 years ago.

Singer once again showed why he is a master of complex, multiple character-driven storytelling as his successful amalgamation of two casts was pulled off without a hitch (eat your heart out J.J. Abrams and his solitary casting of Leonard Nimoy in his Star Trek reboot).

DOFP, surprisingly remains as faithful as it can to its source material; sending an X-Man into the past to stop Mystiques political assassination, which will plummet the future into an apocalyptic nightmare for human and mutant alike.

While Hugh Jackmans Wolverine is the focal point of the film, as his character is the lone one to exist in both time periods, DOFP is really about the continued defining of Erik Lehnsherr and Charles Xaviers relationship. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are the true joys of this movie, volleying back-and-forth in an expertly played tennis match that would rival a Wimbledon championship bout. The true heart and emotion of the movie belongs to McAvoys anguished portrayal of Xavier, who is adrift after the events of X-Men: First Class.

Meanwhile, Fassbender continues to lay the foundation for Ian McKellen's characterization of Magneto, capturing the characters moral conundrum to perfection. The screenwriters must truly understand the 50+ years of character growth as Magneto really is a mystery, one moment looking the hero and the next displaying his villainous traits, which make him one of the most feared adversary's in the Marvel Universe.

Singer manages to pepper the film with cameos, Easter Egg moments and some inspired new characters, including Bishop, Blink and Quicksilver (whos Evan Peters chewed up every scene he was in, including those opposite of Fassbender and McAvoy), all of which allow the film to take its rightful place among the top superhero stories on film. The inevitable comparisons to Marvel Studios successful cinematic universe are probably unfair, as both films offer moviegoers something different and show they can exist in their separate worlds.

Most apocalyptic summer blockbusters end on a positive note with the characters having paid a terrible price. DOFP successfully captures the hope of the Star Trek franchise (of which Singer is a longtime fan) with its ending, which also opens the door to a nostalgic return to when X-Men was the first successful superhero film of this new era, paving the way for todays successful on-screen interpretations and adaptations.",1467676800,,2960,5.182008368200837

539988,3,6303042503,"I wish I could say I enjoyed it more, but I just wasn't feeling the tension as the movie came to a close.  Quicksilver was a lot of fun to watch, and probably the most enjoyable element of the movie.  Jackman's getting so burnt out on playing Wolverine by now that I'd swear he wishes he could use his CGI claws to gut himself.  It's pretty easy to see that the new cast is very enthusiastic about their new parts, whereas the old cast, by contrast are fairly tired and want to move on, so any concerns about how the individuals feel about the circumstances can more-or-less be put to bed. But then of course, I'm also a nerd (ergo I'm watching an ""X-Men"" movie) so silly details like the fact that a mutant whose ability has been to phase through solid matter has suddenly had her ability shifted to include time travel, or consciousness-time-travel, or whatever is something that tends to stay with me throughout the rest of the movie, like an itch in the middle of my back, where I can't reach it-something that isn't REALLY consequential, but it's *there* and distracts me from enjoying the rest of the movie.  I've never been HUGE on X-men.  That is to say that I've not collected and read voluminous stacks of ""The Uncanny X-Men"" comic books.  I've read some of my little brother's, I've thumbed through others in the book store, I've watched the cartoons and the movies and played video games.  I like X-Men, but I wouldn't consider myself a ""source"".  But I will bet folding money that there is a mutant, somewhere with the ability to bend time or shift time or just plain time travel.  Using Shadow Kat to send Wolverine back was just really lazy imho.",1465689600,,1661,4.51

If you remember that, you only have to look at the trailer to realize the obvious differences, but ultimately, the movie stays true to that story.  This is easily the best X-Man film, even taking that into consideration.

I thought the concept was good, but something about it just didn't work for me.  I'm not sure why the story couldn't keep my attention.  Probably because of the plot holes that are often a part of time travel movies, in addition to it being basically another Wolverine movie.  It was visually great - seeing the mutant powers in action is a big reason I wanted to see it.  But the way the future was fixed ended up not making much sense (as in who lived or died), and this is where I have the biggest issue.  The ending just sucked, no matter how good (in a rather mediocre way) the rest of the movie was.",1461196800,,710,4.2611940298507465

542861,5,6303042503,"I am a huge X-Men fan.  About 60% of my comic collection consists of X titles and Wolverine.  I have read the original story several times and was glad that they stuck to the spirit.  Had they made it exactly like the comic the movie would have been about 45 minutes long.  I absolutely love the way the future Sentinels looked, really bad ass.  This was hands down the best movie in the series.

I do have a few small issues, mostly with how Professor X lost his ability to walk.  Not because it's not the same as in the comics but because the way he gets it back in this movie and the way he lost it in First class don't really mesh well.  It would have made more sense if he had lost the ability to walk when Magneto put the coin through Sebastian Shaw's head while Charles was controlling him.  But I'm willing to overlook this because the overall quality of the movie was so amazing.",1458172800,,888,4.207100591715976

542917,5,6303042503,"X-men Days of Futures Past is the first X-men movie to hit the ball out of the park.  It is in a sense a home run.  I loved everything about the movie.  I was wondering when the series was going to shift to the Sentinel storyline similar to a Terminator future.  This was a great movie full of laughs great action sequences.  The overall story rounds out the series beautifully bringing the plot of each movie full circle.  This is the X-men movie I think the majority of the fans really wanted to see a true 5 star offering.

The first movie was very decent; the second movie was great all the way up until the end with the Phoenix stuff bringing down the movie.  The third movie was very average, the forth film First Class was intriguing overall a very good movie but not great.  Finally this film is the best one in the series IMO.  All the pieces just seem to fall into place in this film the opening was excellent the plot flowed well throughout the film and the climax and ending were exceptional.

Whether you like Bryan Singer's directing style or not I think his X-men films are getting better and better.  I grew up with the TV show in the mid to late 1990s and am familiar with a lot of the villains and stories, but was never a hardcore comic book reader.  I think this film captured the spirit of each of the characters perfectly.  The bond of Professor X and Magneto and their friendship really helps drive this story.  Wolverine might be the lead but all the acting is so well done by the supporting cast.

I am eager to see the new film about Apocalypse coming out next.  Overall I would rate this a 5 star film.  I don't think you have to be familiar with the characters or series to really enjoy this film.  Newbies and veterans of the series should enjoy it equally.  I usually do not offer this much praise for a movie unless I truly think it is worth it and this film is entertaining  all the way through.",1457481600,,1927,4.282548476454294

543042,5,6303042503,"I have to say, without a doubt, this is perhaps one of the best XMEN movies made!
I really liked ""The Wolverine"" and the ending of that puts you right in line with this movie. So, basically there are two timelines, of course. How else would we get to see the new actors/actresses coming into the movies?
Look at the original actors for Professor X (Charles), and Magneto (Ian), they are aging fast, although still great actors.
Professor X and Magneto show up at the airport where Wolverine is coming back home.

They basically ask him for help to ""defend"" against annihilation. Sure, what else could it be but that, right? lol
I really liked the cast here and find that for the franchise to move on and forward, they would definitely need a ""timeline"" event happening. Not impossible for the X-MEN since the comics have them doing just that. I have really become to like Jennifer Lawrence as an actress and find that she is great for the role of Mystique. Not to take anything away from Rebecca from the original timeline, Jennifer rocks!

Wolverine gets sent back in time to stop a military style program of ""Sentinels"" from ever happening. I liked the idea and the storyline was pretty good. Is it perfect? No. Not many movies that deal with timelines are. Comics are going to be compared for the ones that do read them and then see these movies. I'm not a comic book reader, but I have seen all the XMEN movies and Wolverine's three movies.
I am happy they have found a way to go on with the younger actors/actresses.

For this movie the picture quality and sound are really good. 7.1 English DTS!

543102,5,6303042503,Personally this has been one of my most favorite X men movies. The progression of student guiding his teacher to change history is inspiring in that a teacher can learn from their students. The fact that kitty can pass a person's conscience through time to their past self is a bit of a stretch which could be over looked. Though it would have been great if the movie continue to show what happened after the climax that professor X was going to explain to Logan at the end. Those details will probably be explained in X Men Apocalypse which I can't wait to see.,1455580800,,562,4.413461538461538

543204,5,6303042503,"If you're an X-men fan-- you probably just about died from excitement when you saw the first trailer that they released for this movie. . . . In case you didn't, it was good-- really good. It also set my expectations incredibly high. When I saw X-Men Days of Future Past in theaters I was more than pleased to find out it was even better than I had hoped for. It brings back most of the cast from X-Men First Class, some of our favorite characters from the ""original X-men"" and things adds a little more spice by introducing a few new ones. Combining the two X-Men casts means that there is a lot of nostalgia (which is good).

 Just like any X-Men movie there are plenty of good action scenes, cool mutant powers, and neat technology. What separates this movie from the rest and makes it great is its compelling story-line and a plethora of renowned/very talented actors.

At first I was worried that with everything that they were trying to throw in we would be overloaded and it would just be too much, but that's definitely not the case. X-Men Days of Future Past is not only my favorite X-Men movie, but also one of my favorite movies in general. It does have some language, brief (rear) nudity, and plenty of violence so I would probably follow the MPAA recommendation (PG-13, parents strongly cautioned). I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone who is/was an X-Men fan or likes good action/superhero movies.",1454544000,,1422,4.590551181102362

543573,4,6303042503,"I would have enjoyed this more if they had just digitally replaced the cast of Back to the Future with the 90's X-Men cartoon characters. Just imagine Beast hanging from the clock, Storm hovering overhead throwing lightning bolts while Jubilee drives the DeLorean.

I'm a fan of Marvel comics and have loved the way Marvel Studios has approached their cinematic Avengers universe. The X-Men film franchise has suffered by comparison. While Marvel Studios gives their characters room to develop, have relationships and be interesting in their solo films (Avengers is another matter...) the X-Men films have all struggled with the desire to cram in as many mutants as possible on screen at the same time. I always thought that the X-Men franchise would have been better if they'd approached it like the first season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-Season-One/dp/B000QDLSR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes - Season One</a>. This movie, with its convoluted time travel plot and contrived happy ending that makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Darko-DIRECTOR-S-CUT/dp/B002MGIIZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Darko DIRECTOR'S CUT</a>&nbsp;look good, is the worst offender.

That being said, it does succeed in being very ""comic book-y"" and I suppose that's why fans have embraced it. Personally, I'd like to see a more simplified, angsty character drama that uses the mutant allegory to comment on society, but I'm clearly in the minority. I don't honestly remember much about this movie, or any of the X-Men films for that matter, so I guess in a way they aren't so terrible as to be memorably bad, just not memorably good. I'm giving it a fairly harsh review, but I'm giving it 4-stars anyways because this is probably the last time we'll get to see Jennifer Lawrence running around in blue body paint. Okay, so I guess there was one memorable thing about the movie...",1451433600,,1975,5.760273972602739

543783,5,6303042503,"Although I'm not a comic book fan or anything, I really enjoy the X-Men series because they are actually relatable and interesting to watch; great casting as well. I love how this film brings the previous X-Men First Class prequel to connect with everything (I wish they would give all the previous X-Men the 3D treatment too), even X-Men 3, which a lot of people did not like.

The story really reminds me of Terminator 2 and Matrix.

What I love even more is 3D, which is also why I bought this (3D films usually cost more, but it's currently selling for really cheap!). The X-Men world and many superhero powers really makes it a fun 3D experience (not just talking heads of 3D) - these films really benefit from 3D. It's like being in the world with them witnessing it all happen; that's why I love 3D.

The ""Quicksilver"" scene is 3D demo worthy and definitely should be seen and experienced that way!

My mother usually falls asleep during films, but I was surprised she was engaged and watched this all the way (has not seen any of the other X-men films and is now interested).  This was a great addition to bring the whole franchise together.",1449532800,,1149,4.5048076923076925

543985,3,6303042503,"Pretty good.  The X-Men films are hit or miss (mostly miss), but this is one of the better ones.  It picks up after the events of the superior First Class, and mostly exists to allow Singer to bring closure to his classic characters from the earlier films, as well as undo many of the stupid decisions and inconsistencies from its sequels and Wolverine spin-offs, and in that regard, is successful.  Fassbender and McAvoy give great performances and it was nice to see Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen (as well as the others) reprise their roles.  Say what you will about Fox's franchise, but casting has never been the problem,  and watching this will remind you just how many wonderful actors have brought these iconic characters to the big screen over the years (because most of them are here).  The film does suffer from having too many characters, and most are relegated to cameo appearances, and the time-travel plot that was so fresh when the comics that this movie are loosely based upon were originally published is cliche now (and has been done better) but overall the film is worth a watch.",1447200000,,1101,4.738219895287958

544076,5,6303042503,"Just because someone stumbles and loses their path, doesn't mean they're lost forever. Sometimes, we all need a little help. These wise words stated by telepath Professor Charles Xavier in X-Men: Days of Future Past symbolize one of the main messages behind the superhero thriller: people can change for the better. In accordance with this theme, the blue, shape-shifting character known as Mystique, or Raven, undergoes a large transformation throughout the film. She acts as a rather misguided hero, not knowing that her actions, while seeming in the best interest of the mutant community, will lead to the demise of the X-Men in the future. In addition, her unique appearance also plays directly into her demeanor and reflects many aspects of her character. Mystiques character is greatly influenced in the film through her interactions with other mutant characters and also reflected in her very symbolic facade.
 Whether for a good or evil cause, Mystique is always, true blue. Her relationships in the film, specifically with Charles Xavier (Professor X), represent her devotion to those around her. When around Charles, she always does what is in the best interest of everyone, humans and mutants alike. For the whole first half of the movie, however, she is without Charless guidance, thus following a darker path. When Charles finally reaches out to Mystique, she is deterred from killing mutant hater, Bolivar Trask. If she had followed through with her original plans and killed Trask, the sentinel program, which would exterminate all mutants, would not have been canceled and she would have been taken captive and tested on. Nearing the end of the film Charles states, Raven, please do not make us the enemy today. You can show them a better path. After hearing this, her true loyalty to Charles ultimately leads to her sparing Trasks life and the cancellation of the sentinel program. During Mystiques interactions with Charles, her mannerisms also prove her loyalty. When around him, she is mostly in her normal, blue appearance, and not disguised as another being, thus symbolizing that she is truly herself when with Charles. Her true nature is only hidden when near characters lead her to malevolent actions, such as Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). She is only true blue, both literally and figuratively, when interacting with Professor X. While her physical contacts with others contributes to her demeanor, her outward appearance also very much reflects her character.
 While not the most appealing character to look at, the colors that are prominent in Mystiques look, specifically blue, red, and yellow, are incredibly symbolic. The most noticeable of all of her colors is blue. Blue is known to represent trust and loyalty, in some cases, which are some of the main aspects of her character. As described earlier, Mystique is always faithful to one character or another, whether good or bad, so it makes sense that blue is the most blatant color in her appearance.  Although blue takes up much of her body, it is not hard to recognize her fiery red hair. Red is known to symbolize passion and determination. This directly plays into her character, as she is passionate about saving the mutant race and determined to ensure that mutants will no longer be viciously murdered. Whether for a good or evil cause, her enthusiasm is always displayed and her hair is always, fittingly, scorching red. The final color, yellow, is not very noticeable, but it is found in her eyes. Yellow usually stands for fear or cowardice, and, while not the biggest aspects of Mystiques character, they have a much deeper meaning. As she is acting as the leader in the fight against Trask, her fear is somewhat hidden. In accordance, the color yellow is hidden on her body, representing that while she has fear, it is not readily shown in her character. When Mystique is frightened by something, her eyes widen greatly, making the yellow more apparent on her body. For example, when she discovers Trasks autopsy reports of her many mutant friends, her eyes bulge and she begins to cry. This, therefore, symbolizes her fear of the mass mutant death that could be caused by Trasks program. While rather concealed, Mystiques fear is more evident through her yellow eye color. Overall, the colors in Mystiques appearance greatly reflect her personality and overall goals throughout the movie.
Through her genuine loyalty to Charles and her very symbolic facade, Mystique largely represents the main theme of X-Men: Days of Future Past, that people can completely transform for the better. In the final seconds of the movie, Charles Xavier states, Countless choices define our fate; each choice, each moment, a moment in the ripple of time. Enough ripple, and you change the tide for the future is never truly set. In the film, Mystiques choices are what defined the future for all of humanity. By sparing Trasks life, her whole demeanor is changed and she sets humanity on a brighter path, rippling the tide of history and altering the future.  By adding Mystiques personal change to the film, Director Bryan Singer also alters the tide of the X-Men series, bringing back characters that were previously killed in other movies. Mystiques character, therefore, not only changes for the better of those in the film, but also in real life, by fixing all of the problems that had previously taken place in other films in the series. In accordance with Xaviers statement in the film, Mystiques choices and transformation caused enough ripple to change two futures: the future of the individuals in the film and the future of Singers X-Men films as a whole.",1446681600,,5641,5.029946524064171

Not too in your face, but I was very immersed at all times. Great story and a clever integration of all of the new characters with those of the original films. Props to Hugh who seems to get more and more ripped for every movie he makes in the franchise.

The cast is different in some aspects and the story tries to tell a back story and future story at the same time which makes for a confusing re-vamp of x-men previous films.

I am sure I have forgotten enough of the details to not nerd rage about what was different but the feel of the original story was captured. I liked getting the chance to see the old professor and Magneto doing their thing and flashing back to the younger versions from the last movie. I have really enjoyed what Hugh Jackman has done with the character of Wolverine and I will miss him when he decides to hang up the claws. The scene's with quicksilver really steals the show for me and you don't laugh at the slow-mo scene in the kitchen then you might have forgotten that you are watching a comic come to life.

If you've seen the other Xmen movies (not first class) this movie will be somewhat jarring in its need to dismiss the original trilogy's legacy. If you haven't though it oddly works well as a standalone film.  A fun watch but children of the atom purists beware, they like to grant assinine powers to characters that never had them for the sake of plot convenience. An apparent standard for Fox Marvel franchises",1439078400,,459,4.725
545472,5,6303042503,"In this movie, it starts off in a dark future with mutants in dwindling numbers being
hunted by Sentinels.  So the last survivors of the X-Men led by Professor Charles
Xavier seeks a way to change the past to prevent the destruction of mutants.  With
the help of Kitty Pryde, they send Logan's mind back to his 1973 self where one
mutant killed a man named Bolivar Trask, the man who designed the Sentinels,
which after his death caused the government to mass produce the Sentinels to
start hunting down mutants.

All Logan must do is find the younger selves of Professor Xavier and Magneto
and convince them to save the world from the dismal future it faces.  But Logan
knows that it will not be easy as Professor Xavier warned him.  Can they do it?

It is great to see McKellan and Stewart and everyone else in this movie.  When
I watched this the first time, I wondered how this plot would be pulled off.  It is
awesome as both worlds are brought together!!!  Also liked Quicksilver (known as
Peter is this one) helping out!  Also has a funny gag reel and trailers.  Must watch!

545583,5,6303042503,"I remember buying and reading the two X-Men comic books back in 1980 that this movie is (loosely) based upon, when I was 10-11 years old.  Bryan Singer does an excellent job, as do the returning actors who appeared in the previous X-Men films.

""Xmen: Days of Future Past"" marks the return of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan in their iconic roles of Professor X and Magneto, as well as James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender playing their younger selves. Jennifer Lawrence, reprising her role as Mystique from ""X-Men: First Class,"" is a convincing anti-hero, like Wolverine was in the original trilogy. Wolverine is a 100% good-guy in this film.  The time-travel aspect of the movie eventually erases the past, especially the sub-par 2006 ""Last Stand"" film, and re-boots the X-Men series in a way that the prequel ""First Class"" could not. In my opinion, this is probably the best of the seven X-Men and Wolverine films to date.

With ""Xmen: Apocalypse"" due out in 2016, I can only hope that future X-Men films will bring the Phoenix/Dark Phoenix saga from the comic books to the big screen in a much better way than the failed attempt to do so in ""Last Stand"".",1438473600,,1158,4.717821782178218

545692,5,6303042503,"X-Men Days of Future Past was a great movie-- and I don't say that often. While I know it has received a lot of hate and there are some things that maybe don't make sense in it, if you're looking for a entertaining movie I thought this was the perfect amount of humor, action and drama. No movie is entirely perfect, but this one comes close to it. If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth your time.

While I loved the movie and got it for a great deal through Amazon Instant Video being my first Amazon Instant Video purchase I was a little disappointed. The quality of the movie was okay but the real problem was the Instant Video platform that you have to watch it through. I watched it on my laptop and it just a little clunky to use and got in the way when trying to change the volume or pause.

Perhaps in the future Amazon will revamp their Instant Video Platform but I much prefer Google Play and ended up getting this same movie for free on that platform so doubt I will ever watch it again through Amazon. I generally am a fan of Amazon products but they need to upgrade their Instant Video Experience.

545833,3,6303042503,"There was a justifiable fear heading in to this 5th X-Men movie that they were throwing in every character from the previous trilogy (the old X-Men trilogy and the prequel X-Men: First Class) because they didn't know what else to do.  We know from experience that overloading a superhero movie is a bad, bad, thing (were talking to you Spiderman 3, and you Batman & Robin).  That and the time-travel device of returning to the past to correct some mistake in order to change the world (but don't step on a butterfly!).  Though this new romp juggles a lot of characters, certainly at the expense of any real development of any individual, it pulls off the plotting, bolstered by a groovy 70s art design (I half-expected the Brady Bunch to show up in a crowd scene) and Hugh Jackmans commitment to Wolverine, the only X-man apparently capable of going back in time without being ripped apart.

In the near future, robots called Sentinels, designed to guard against mutant threats, become sentient and totalitarian, forcing a martial law society and hunting down all mutants for instant execution.  Surviving remnants of the X Men, somehow led by Professor X (who SPOILER ALERT died at the end of X Men: The Last Stand?), figure out a loophole in time so that they can go back to avert the Sentinels creation.  Wolverine is sent to hunt down the young and self-exiled Professor X and must convince him (and Magneto, imprisoned for the assassination of Kennedy) to find the rogue Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence, not to be confused with the mystical Rogue, played by Anna Paquin) before she kills the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask (a righteously smug Peter Dinklage), which puts in motion the Sentinel program.

The plot does get convoluted and will not be for everyone to follow, but theres more than enough set pieces, exciting action sequences, and 70s real history and character name-dropping to keep you involved.  The highlight is a sequence with Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a speedster who is enlisted to spring Magneto from the Pentagons high security bunker.  The scene, showing his ultra-fast action in slow-mo (for him) taking down a squadron of security forces, is a funny, creatively imagined thrill from beginning to end.

CLICHES:  time travel saves the day; an overly wrapped and tidy ending; really, a Tibetan monastery?
SURPRISES:  Jennifer Lawrence, for playing a girl dressed in blue scales, brings true pathos to her character; Hugh Jackman has not lost his edge as Wolverine after 4 movies and a few cameos
DONT GET TOO CONFUSED: Quicksilvers winning cameo in this movie may confuse viewers of next years Avengers 2: The Age of Ultron, in which Quicksilver will be played by Aaron Taylor Johnson

545885,1,6303042503,"As someone who loved the original Chris Claremont comic book story I had high expectations for this, but the honest truth is that this was a very boring, weak translation of the original material. Far too much CG, too many characters and a completely convoluted plot with too much going on then boring lags of characters drinking booze on airplanes and staring quietly and meaningfully at one another.

The film opens with an over the top, overly CGI future sequence with horrendously goofy-looking sentinels (they looked awesome in the comic, especially as drawn by John Byrne, but they just looked terrible here) pursuing the few surviving mutants, made up of a bunch of mostly forgettable characters in the future. (Spoiler) They make the decision to send Wolverine back to the 1970's to mess around with changing the timeline with the hopes everyone will be saved in the future. If you really read into it and analyze it, and think about all of the changes that Wolvie would have introduced it's amazing that it took two hours of film for changes to start appearing in the future (just freeing Magneto alone, you'd think, would have had some epic future consequences.)

There's one highlight of the film and that's the sequence with the mutant Quicksilver dashing about a Pentagon kitchen to Jim Croce's 'Time in a bottle' while rearranging bullets- if you haven't seen the sequence it's pointless to try to describe but in the film the scene is simply amazing, and a totally rewatchable sequence (actually, skip this film and just look up the ""Quicksilver Jim Croce"" scene on youtube). Beyond that there's really nothing notable to the film and I found it really boring. Lots of slow, plodding dialog in the mansion, and slow, plodding dialog on airplanes, and the final resolution just sort of feels flat and shallow.

There's also a lot of stuff that felt ripped off. The DNA title sequence felt a little too much like earlier X-men films (or was it Spider-man that did that gimmick?)  The swirling red faces of cerebro looked strangely like Willy Wonka's goofy boat ride. And Professor X probing Wolverine's brain with his hand on his head seemed a little too mind-meldish from 'Star Trek III'.  (including the slightly-watery eye). This was just really bad.

546088,4,6303042503,"Did I enjoy Days of Future Past?  Yeah, but Im an old school Marvel comics geek so its rather easy for me to enjoy mediocre fare while being hyper-critical at the same time.  Ive got to give it to the storys writers (Simon Kinberg, Matthew Vaughan, and Jane Goldman).  They did the smart thing and didn't attempt to balance a large cast of mutants (the story bounces back and forth between 1973 and 2023 and we get to see different mutants during these time periods) but instead focused on the primaries: Wolverine, Professor Xavier, Magneto, and Mystique.  Its not that there is no screen time given to Storm, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Bishop, Sunspot, Blink and others; its that the time they are given is brief and centered around action and not character development so the many characters don't become a distraction or bog the story down.  This is a blessing to the average movie patron but perhaps a curse if you're a fan and your particular favorite mutant gets shorted (as for me I was happy that Bishop, never a favorite of mine but a popular character in the comics and an important one in the canon, didn't get a lot of love).  But the story writers had an unenviable task following after the mishap and mishandling shown in The Last Stand and the continuity-skewing, uneven but highly entertaining First Class: how to bring a series of films that are supposed to have a continuity back into continuity when that continuity has been skewed/ altered/ destroyed?  The answer turned out to be surprisingly simple: time travel.  Borrowing heavily on a classic X-Men storyline (first introduced in Uncanny X-Men #141) this film universe cleans up the intervening messiness  and resets the continuity point back sometime shortly after the events of the first X-Men feature film.  Wolverine has his conscience sent back in time to his 1973 personhood who then helps to bring a disillusioned Prof. X and a murderous Magneto together to stop the U.S. government and Bolivar Trask from successfully implementing a Sentinel defense program that is destined to not just eradicate mutantkind but also turns on their human creators.  Along the way we get to see the joy of what it must be like to be a super-speedster as we are introduced to Quicksilver, see Mystiques loyalties tested and fracture her relationship with Magneto, and see some new faces in the future as the small band of surviving X-Men constantly throwdown with super sentinels.  The future aspect of the storyline is far less interesting than the past.  The time travel storyline wasn't convoluted and was easy to follow so, overall, the package was a decent one.

Prior to seeing this I had personally talked with about ten people who had praised it and only one who felt let down.  This increased my hope for this movie as, I must admit, I had little given the lackluster marketing and my concerns over how they were going to handle such a large cast.  While my expectations were raised a bit for the movie I still feel that the more enjoyable movies of this franchise so far have been X-Men United and First Class.  Still, the ending made it all worth it and Im excited to see where theyll go with the series now.  3.75 stars.",1435190400,,3192,4.731046931407942

That's what disappoints me about the X-Men. They have the cast but confuses the audience with the storylines especially when we, the audience know how the story in the comic was.

There are some scenes that I am convinced are not logical even within the comic book parameters, but they are still quite entertaining. The movie plot does feel like it sort of comes out of nowhere and doesn't quite belong within the continuum in order to correct some things done in previous movies.

Featuring both the original cast (Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellan, Ellen Page, etc) as well as the new cast (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, etc) and of course Hugh Jackman who has appeared in every X-Men movie to date if I'm not mistaken. The story features multiple timelines as the mutants struggle for survival and peaceful coexistence with humanity and deals heavily with the consequences of one's choices and such. Features some excellent action scenes and great performances by the main cast as well as what I think is the best high speed/slow mo scene ever done in a movie.

My main gripe is that Peter Dinklage is very underused in his role. He's a phenomenal actor and deserved more screen time and better dialogue.",1430352000,,854,4.8493150684931505

547327,4,6303042503,I liked it just fine but I liked First Class better.  And they don't explain how Professor X was alive and in the same body (Patrick Stewart) after he was clearly ripped to shreds in The Last Stand.  What gives??  No explanation whatsoever.  No disrespect to Mr. Stewart but It would have made more sense to have Professor X in the movie with his consciousness in his new body as we saw at the end of The Last Stand.  We are just expected to accept it as it's presented to us I guess.  Or maybe they are pretending that movie isn't part of the movie canon?  Dunno but it didn't make sense. Maybe I missed something?,1430092800,,615,4.25

547766,5,6303042503,"Okay. Everyone knows the franchise goes through wolverine for the edge and action

But what appeals to me is the acting as well.  For  that we turn to Patrick and Ian - or Charles and Eric.  The heat between these two from the start was that, ""here's where something's going to change"" stuff.

While they keep going back and forth in all the movies about  ideology these two have to be around or it seems a second best effort

Now to this movie

Hugh Jackman  is sent back in time to help unite the mutants - actually Charles and Eric to help stop raven before she kills someone and starts a spiral effect into a war the mutants can't win. They know this in modern times. Hence the sending him back

Good action. If you're an X Men fan. Get it

547960,2,6303042503,"Yet another writer who could not resist the lure of time travel - resulting in the same, predictable mess.  Nothing about this movie makes sense:  How did prof X come back to life, how did the present world turn into some wired futuristic nightmare where mutants are almost extinct, how could human (albeit mutant) DNA be used to enhance robots?  It's one thing to cover a robot in human tissue (Terminator) but another thing entirely to create robots with ""genetic"" traits.  There's also the typical time travel paradox:  If a past event is changed resulting in a different future, then the future event that precipitated going into the past would not have happened meaning that the past would not have changed.  And then there's the characters, all of them wooden and uninteresting.  I never thought Wolverine would be boring, but they managed to do it in this film.  I know I'm in the minority but for me it's takes more than special effects and explosions to make a good movie.",1428969600,2,981,4.729411764705882

Not the best in the series but as a 35 year X fan it's hard for me to not enjoy seeing these iconic heroes of my youth. Seeing some new characters each time is great but their useage in this film was way to little. McAvoy's portrayal of young Professor Xavier is a highlight.,1428969600,,356,4.25

There is some comedic parts especially with Quicksilver,but this film is a dark movie. I think this is not a film for younger kids because of the violence and there is about two not appropriate scenes for younger viewers. Otherwise this is a wonderful film and one of the greatest superhero films of all time.

549010,5,6303042503,"I love science fiction and I hate superheroes, but I credit the X-Men series with giving me an appreciation for them. X-Men has showed me that in the proper context, with some great writers, superheroes movies don't have to be the lowest form of sci-fi entertainment. Days of Future Past seemed to confuse some people, as it's not part of the trilogy and therefore it's timeline is off. The ending of the film also creates a paradox, which eliminates certain mistakes made in the other films. In layman's terms, some of the things that happen in the other X-Men movies, never happen, because of Days of Future Past. In an undetermined era, sometime between the end of the original film and Last Stand, a new enemy has been targeting mutants. These machines, meant to eliminate the mutants have malfunctioned and are now targeting humans as well. The machines are made with mutant DNA and therefore have the combined forces of all the mutants it's come in contact with, making them unstoppable. The only chance the X-Men have is for one of them to go back in time and stop the machines from ever being built. Wolverine is the only one with a mind strong enough to survive the trip and is sent back to the 1970s, where he meets the cast of X-Men: First Class. While difficult for non-sci-fi aficionados to understand, this film was not only extremely well written, but serves dual purposes for the series. First, it brings both casts together in an extreme fashion and it's a tremendous gift for the fans. Second, it allows the writers to undo mistakes from The Last Stand, which was at the time, set to be the final X-Men film. The ending to Days of Future Past, effectively explain that everything that happened in Last Stand, never happened, as it was part of an alternate timeline. This allows the writers to bring back characters like Prof. X (who is seen killed in that film) for possible future films. It really was an ingenious move for the franchises future, but it also allowed fans to experience the ""old timers"" and the ""new class"" working together, in a huge, diverse, and very impressive cast. Seldom are superheroes films so complicated or as well written as Days of Future Past. The writing is out of this world, the cast is full of stars, and the special effects were absolutely amazing.

Just the right balance of action, posturing and talking.  The time travel isn't any more or less absurd than the time travel in any other flick.  Clocking in at well over 2 hours, the entire movie is really just an elaborate ret-con to revive the characters killed in X-Men 3.  I hope they bring back Nightcrawler for the next installment.",1427587200,,505,4.693181818181818

549328,2,6303042503,Great story line but the movie didn't do it justice.  Way too much emphasis on Wolverine my least favorite character.  Jennifer Lawrence is a terrible actress.  I don't understand why she is in so many big screen movies.  The movie introduced Quicksilver and Apocalypse at the end.  Two characters and story lines that would have made this movie EXCELLENT.  Sadly those two characters were not the main focus of the mostly boring too much CGI movie.,1427328000,,449,4.842105263157895

I guess they did the best they could given how the story lines went in the first 3 X-Men movies, Origins and Wolverine.

It was a really new type of superhero movie and Bryan Singer is pretty gutsy, taking those risks for this movie. I was really impressed with it and it feels like one of those types of movies that after you see it, you feel like watching again. I would say that this movie is the best superhero movie of 2014 (and probably the best movie in general, since I haven't really seen anything else other than the Marvel films and the Hunger Games. Oh, and Divergent.)",1427068800,,570,4.386792452830188

550064,3,6303042503,"Just because this is the latest ""X-Men"" movie does not automatically make it the best ""X-Men"" movie. Think people. The story/plot was completely different from the rest of the ""X-Men"" movies. However, there were pros and cons (like almost every movie) of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"". Here they are:

Pros:
1. Completely different story/plot than the rest of the ""X-Men"" movies
2. Combined the old version of the X-Men with the new/current version of the X-Men in one film
3. Had a very interesting twist with the Sentinels (if you're a die-hard, true X-Men comic fan, then you would have known that in the comics the Sentinels do not have ability that Mystique has-they are just plain robots in the original comics)
4. Painstaking tease at the end of this film (see it to know what I mean-I'm looking forward to Apocalypse ""Now"")

Cons:
1. Too much focus on Wolverine's character (it seems he's always the hero in every X-Men movie now-that's getting old like he slowly is)
2. A depressing story/plot
3. Introduction of some weird characters not in previous X-Men movies (I thought it was refreshing to see new characters, but they were not developed in this film so the average person who does not know much about the X-Men comics was most likely clueless about who the heck they are-bad idea to include them in this film without telling their stories)",1426982400,,1354,4.757446808510639

550070,4,6303042503,"Out of all the X-Men films I've watched in my life, Days of Future Past was the best so far. Bryan Singer did an amazing job directing this sequel, which also happened to be a partial reboot due to the fact that it consisted the element of time travel to prevent a war with indestructible, invincible and unstoppable sentinels. Some may loved and enjoyed the original X-Men trilogy while others hated it due to the things that happened from X-Men 1-3. However, none of that matters because Days of Future past successfully undid all the damage and the X-Men universe is back on track. I highly recommend it. Although if you want more, I suggest you wait this summer for the Rogue Cut edition, which was why I gave the review 4 stars rather than 5/5.",1426896000,,749,4.514705882352941

This movie is a 10 Star Marvel movie, it's the solo Wolverine movie we've WANTED to see (SO much better than Origins and THE Wolverine) along with all our other favorites backing him up with an incredible storyline that improves the comic book storyline of the same name from the 80's.

Should have got out while the getting was good!  As I was watching it, I got the impression that the tech geeks had come up with all kinds of special effects CGI stuff and then put together ""a story"" that could utilize those CGI ideas.

An all-star cast assembles and prepares for war in this action packed movie with nonstop fantasy/science fiction excitement and adventure! This reminds me a LOT of the Terminator movies but with a more superhero twist. MUCH more gritty than other X-Men movies. Hundreds of Sentinel robots are hunting mutants and also now humans with the potential of birthing mutants are being killed by these super robots as well. Wolverine plays an important role in time traveling to the past to save the future. No spoilers! This once again reminds me of a cross between X-men and The Terminator and is rated PG for violence.

Ordered another just in case and same problem - issues with audio and freezing.  Went ahead and bought regular DVD and it was fine.

554549,5,6303042503,"Excellent sequel to First Class adds more firepower by including team members from the original series of films. Yes, purists will whine because the movie differs a great deal from the comics but you have to remember: this is the movie universe NOT the comics universe. Excellent effects make the powers of all the mutants pretty amazing. Film goes overboard trying to cram way too many characters into the alternate future timeline, leaving you with a ""Wait! Who the heck was that?"" moment every few seconds. Original cast members get a last (?) romp and seem to be having a grand time. The scene between old & young Xavier is a terrific one. The introduction of Quicksilver is lots of fun and he gets perhaps the single greatest scene in the entire film as he displays his powers in an awesome sequence brilliantly set to the classic Jim Croce tune ""Time In  A Bottle"" that just stuns. Young Xavier, Magneto & Mystique are uniformly excellent and The Sentinels finally get a chance to strut their stuff, though many may balk at the huge changes to the design of their future versions. I was thoroughly engrossed & entertained for 2+ hours and that's all I need to sell me on this and whole-heartedly recommend it to you. If you like X-Men 2 and First Class then you should LOVE this installment in the popular mutant series. As one would expect of a new film in high-def, this Blu-ray presentation of the movie does not disappoint. Clean, crisp picture & the sound mix is leveled nicely, no muffled dialogue or sudden explosive music or effects to force you to constantly adjust the volume during the film. Lots of cool (but brief) bonus features are included, too. Also note: there's a post end credits teaser that gives us a glimpse of the chaos to come in the series' next installment: X-Men - Apocalypse.

554611,4,6303042503,"""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is the 7th film in the X-Men franchise, including the Wolverine spin-offs, and Bryan Singer returns to the directing chair for the 4th time. It is inspired by the ""Days of Future Past"" storyline introduced in the ""Uncanny X-Men"" comic books in 1981. In this version, Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) gazes at a devastated New York City and laments the war between humans and mutants that threatens to bring mutants to extinction. The remaining mutants, including Prof. Xavier and Magneto (Ian McKellan), convene high in the mountains in China to hide from Sentinels, robots with the ability to mutate and to detect mutant genes. The mutants' last hope is for Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) to send Wolverine's mind back to 1973, where he must prevent Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from assassinating a scientist named Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), an act that will spur humans into action against mutants and result in the development of the Sentinels.

""Days of Future Past""'s gimmick is to be a period film as well as sci-fi action. Wolverine travels back to the days of funk, malaise, and the Saigon Peace Accords in Paris. Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is in prison. Mystique is full of rage against Dr. Trask for good reason. And a younger, disillusioned Prof. Xavier (James McAvoy) has chosen his legs and his peace of mind over his mental abilities. So all must be convinced to get with the program to save the future for mutants and humans. The cast is strong, with the exception of Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, and they almost overcome the fact that every X-Men movie seems to be about the same thing. I can't help but wish for Rebecca Romijn whenever I see Mystique. Romijn was far superior to Lawrence in the role. Lawrence is insufficiently lithe and has a child's voice. I have to say that the film's opening action sequence was a big bore, and the action atop the mountain is downright hokey. So the period vibe is a big help.",1423612800,,1967,4.8023598820058995

The Institute has zero students, the professor has no powers, the only one at the institute is Hank a.k.a. beast, and owe did I menschen that other person needed for this mission is Magneto and he's in a prison is the dead center of the pentagon. Owe wolverine also runs into a younger version of his favorite person William Striker.  Nice sneak peak of Apocalypse.",1423353600,3,912,4.333333333333333
554664,5,6303042503,"This movie was great - while it differed a bit with the original story line in the comics - it was still extremely well done and very entertaining.  In the comics of course Kitty is the one to go back instead of Wolverine - but obviously in the world we live in today - people are more interested in seeing Hugh Jackman as Wolverine on screen than they are in seeing Ellen Page.
Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique is great, having a lot of the old cast members from previous movies showing up is a great bonus as well. With Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart back again as well - just feels great watching them on screen again.
The sentinels are just down right amazing creations in a pretty scary world envisioned for us in the future.  Able to change and adapt to whatever powers they are facing - they are very adept at hunting down and killing mutants and basically exterminating them.
One of the best scenes / parts of the movie is with Quicksilver freeing Magneto.  I could watch the scene time after time - it's just so well done and so amazing.
While they did a good job with the movie - I think that Marvel Studios would have done a better job with it if it was in their hands instead of with 20th Century Fox.  Marvel even told their comic book creators to stop creating new characters since those characters also become the property of the movie studios instead of Marvel.  Sad - very sad.
They were so stupid to sell the characters off for money back when they were cash strapped.  Hopefully some day they will get the rights back to their own characters or be able to afford to just buy them back.  Just doesn't seem right to have all these different studios with control of some of the most famous characters and also constantly messing up the movies.
Sony had no business in rebooting the Spider Man franchise.  The Wolverine Origins movie was horrible with what they did to Deadpool.  The Fantastic Four movies were Meh.  The Silver Surfer movie was bleh.
This movie though is very entertaining, I'm looking forward to future X-Men adventures on the big screen.  I could definitely see Mystique, Rogue, Quicksilver, and many others all getting solo movies or at least - movies focused on them with additional 'extras' thrown in to support them.",1423353600,,2253,4.524630541871921

This movie is a huge part of the series because it ties both sets of movies together. It shows us what the future is like for the mutants and has awesome special effects for that portion of the movie. Then, we are taken back into the past, 1970s, to show certain events that took place, which affected how mutants were perceived by others. There are many scenes that are played out perfectly, particularly the one between the past and future versions of Professor Xavier.

555379,2,6303042503,"I watched parts of the recent TV film awards.  Though I missed some nominations, I did notice that this movie IS from 2014, and I seem to recall little to NO mention of it at the awards.  It seemed like the family's drunken uncle that everyone's embarrassed to talk about.

Yet some even proclaimed this sequel perhaps ""THE BEST X-MEN EVER!""  Yes, I watched almost all the prior movies (except one of two prequels centered on Wolfman...)  What do I remember of the PLOT of all those prior films?  Uh...there were a lot of strange-looking actors in strange-looking outfits..no wait, that isn't a PLOT, is it?  Uh...there were a lot of very cool special effects..oh wait, that isn't a plot EITHER.  There was Halle Berry looking like she was nude and painted all blue...(sigh) I know.  Not a plot.  What I remember basically is: there were weird mutants among us, for really UNCLEAR reasons, and some normal people wanted to kill them, and as a result some of them wanted to fight against us, which resulted in...them also fighting each other.

Having recently watched this one, what about its PLOT?  After all what really makes a good movie, if anything, has to be plot, dialog and acting.  You can make a great movie without any special effects or even fancy photography, but you CANNOT make a great film without at the least some interesting story and acting (even dialog can be dispensed with sometimes).  Uh--there were weird mutants among us for really UNCLEAR reasons, some people wanted to kill them, some of them wanted to kill us, or each other--oh, plus TIME TRAVEL (which if nothing else perhaps allowed adding some younger, perhaps sexier stars for a younger generation, for the actors' younger doubles (can you spell Scarlett Johansson?)  Oh--plus KILLER ROBOTS.  Wow--what more could a 13 year old dude ASK for, anyhow?  Who cares about plot when you have SCARLETT JOHANSSON PLUS KILLER ROBOTS?

Say!  There's a PHONE NUMBER on the back of my Blu-ray jacket!  Questions?  Call 1-888-223-4369.  I have a question: HOW CAN I GET MY MONEY BACK?

In SO MANY WAYS, this really IS Days of Future Past.  Let's just try to count some of the concepts this movie ripped off.  First there's the MOODY BLUES, who happened to write the song of the above name.  Second: The Matrix (right--the sunglasses--even when they totally aren't necessary as in dim interior light).  Third: ALL the Terminator movies.  That would be...umm...KILLER ROBOTS.  Fifth: everything that seemed cool or memorable about 1970, like lucky rabbit feet, Richard Nixon (clearly, not in any particular order here), blob-lights, Vietnam, and waterbeds OH MY!  Whatever happened to waterbeds?  I think as baby boomers got older they realized how darn HARD it is to climb OUT of one (which you see in this film, btw).  Sixth: Magritte (yes, the painter).  Seventh: let's just say they ripped off Hugh Jackman's body, because unlike female actresses, for whom it's TOTALLY LEGIT to admire them solely for their BODIES (see blue and nude above), we expect SO MUCH MORE from our male actors (you know, like Sylvester Stallone)  Here we have Hugh Jackman fully nude.  No ladies, not FRONTAL, but otherwise yeah--fully nude... Eighth: Game of Thrones.  Or is it unfair to say this ""ripped it off"" just by stealing (or at least BORROWING) one of its most interesting actors? [Peter Dinklage].  PETER!  You've got MORE IMPORTANT THINGS to be doing!  Like more episodes of GOT!

Well I guess by now it's obvious that even had I been one of the voters for the Golden Globes (not that I can confirm or deny that I AM!), this film still wouldn't have won any awards.  And yes, I deleted way #4 above, but there are SOME THINGS that those IN THE KNOW (like voters for the awards, for example) just AREN'T ALLOWED TO SHARE!  Otherwise, I totally would...However if you enjoy movies SOLELY for nice special effects, you MIGHT like it.  I give it a C-.",1422576000,,3907,4.77727952167414
555380,4,6303042503,"X-Men Days of Future Past is very good and entertaining.  We have a fun and exciting action driven special effects extravaganza that times in with the other films of this franchise.

 The film moves along well but I did have a few problems with the story line arch and plot.  Being a hardcore sci fi and X-Men fan since I was young I remembered the plot behind DOFP in both the comic book and the Fox Cartoon series I loved.  This really did not follow the original story line as well I thought it should, and went off on a tangent to feature the lovely Jennifer Lawrence off and have her interact more with the other star actors. (Because hey, after all what modern sci fi action adventure movie doesn't feature Jennifer Lawrence??)

  I had some problems with the mechanics of the plot and found major loopholes, first they had the problem of Prof. X being stuck in that damn wheelchair, so what do they come up with?  A mutant magic formula that acts like Heroine addiction and walla, Prof. Xavier can walk again and keep up with the other characters, problem solved right!

 Wolverine is an awesome kick ass tough guy character, and he can hold his own weight beyond even standing alone when the time comes for him to be the ""Lonewolf"" guy.  Because he is macho and aggressive, there lies the problem and the separation between him and the other characters.  Some of these other X-Men just do not match up at all to him, it is as if you teamed Clint Eastwood up in a movie with Gumby, it just doesn't work.

The time travel portion of the movie also is questionable, to the point where an 80's modified Delorian built by Christopher Lyod as a plot moving device sounded more plausible then ""Kitty Pride's"" head touching magic power.  So he can go back into his own memories, but how does that make him travel back physically and even if you had super memories of the past doesn't mean it is a video game where you can move around and change things, but according to this film you can.  That is how we learn they keep ahead of the Sentinel robotic monsters, who look really nothing like the Sentinels in the cartoon or comic series I recalled (except the ones working with President Richard Nixon!).

Instead of using the new mutant character Bishop, as they did in the other DOFP story from the Fox cartoon series, Wolverine is the main guy and Bishop is only a side character seen in the film just for stunts and looks.

We do have a cool Chinese lady character who throws cosmic wormholes to escape through which I thought was a cool and freaky effect.

 Beast's role is portrayed well in this story, for he acts as a Mr. Spock like sci fi reference and builder of cool jet fighters and gadget guy. He struck me as a blue ""Wolf Man"" with his new 70's image.  Different from his big blue cat image from the other previous film.

The main character in this story is ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklegde as the evil scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask, the man behind the Sentinel program and the one manipulating President Richard Nixon and others to go along with his schemes.

 The diobolical Colonel William Stryker also makes an important appearance at Dr. Trask's side.  He is interested in performing inhumane experiments on the mutants with the attempt to create super soldier race at his command.

What I didn't like was the timeline in the future, it seemed way too close to our modern present and that was not what the original story had in mind.  The story should have been set even further out into the future, making Dr. X and Magneto even older and the setting of the future more believable, not make it so close to the present time.

 Wolverine, (Jackman), in this move does a lot of acting but not enough fighting as I felt he should have done in this film compared with the others.  And the story arch of him being this muscle guy for the mob back in the 70's had been interesting, but here is my problem with movies today- everything is way too PG-13.

Another major plot issue I had besides the big plot-hole time travel problem they seemed to not be able to satisfy enough was Magneto, if he is such a bad sinister misguided guy then WHY bust him out of jail and bring him in on there heroic attempt to save the planet??? Okay Magneto finally figured out his wicked ways when he reached 89 years old, but why bring him into the team at all especially since Dr. Trask already made the Sentinels of the 1970's non metallic (how do you get by that problem when you need coper wires for electronics)??

 And then they threw in this huge whopper of them all, JFK was a mutant!!! Huh??? Say that again Magneto??  So Magneto didn't kill the President after all, he was in on the other counter conspiracy to save him, but I guess Lee Harvey Oswald was just way to darn quick and clever.

 Another point in the movie, after manipulating the Sentinels main programing to attack everyone in Washington, Magneto then tells them to do what they were programed to do, hunt & kill mutants.  If this was the case, why did they not target Magneto right away then & only went after Hugh Jackman and the Beast???  Another major plot hole.

There needed to be a bit more polishing up to the screen play but over all I really liked the film and look forward for the next of this never ending X-Men saga franchise!",1422489600,,5310,4.440660474716203

My father was extremely strict when it came to entertainment, and he found superheroes as a whole to be far too violent for a young boy to entertain himself with, and so for years I was only allowed to actively enjoy Spider-Man and Superman, two heroes that my father deemed tame enough for his son.  So, whenever Id go to the grocery store with my mother, Id spend the hour or so in the magazine isle reading comic after comic of X-Men adventures, praying that she wouldnt catch me.  I didn't own any X-Men action figures until I was around twelve, when my father started getting soft and pretty much just didn't care anymore.  So, for all time now, I will carry with me this eventual victory over, what I deemed childhood oppression, and so because of that I will always love the X-Men.

When Bryan Singer brought the X-Men to the big screen back in 2000, I was thrilled.  I was fifteen and it was like the culmination of all things awesome about my childhood was being realized.  I was crossing over from boy to man, and the X-Men were coming with me.

Im not like this huge Singer advocate, but his presence was absolutely missed in that third messy installment.

Now Singer is back (well, he came back for First Class) and his passion for the X-Men, their stories, their characters and their development is felt so strongly in every fiber of these films.  He makes my childhood soul smile and my adult soul smirk because he just gets it, he understands how to merge the boy and the man and make it all feel right.

And this has nothing to do with his extracurricular activities/indiscretions.

Conceptually, X-Men: Days of Future Past felt like a mistake.  I got these awful flashbacks to all the reasons that X-Men: The Last Stand didn't work, and I was worried, especially because, while it wasn't perfect, I really liked the direction that X-Men: First Class was taking with the franchise.  Still, this whole merge of the two worlds, old and young character stuff just felt verystuffy.  Too many characters, too many ideas, not enough attention to detail and I was sure that this was going to be one of those superhero mistakes that gets slaughtered by critics and fans.

How Singer makes this work is beyond me, but it works so wellI mean SO well.

Singer did a lot of things here that made me happy.  He established a Sentinel world that didn't feel cheesy or unauthenticated, and he did so with a few short scenes that didn't feel like they were missing the details they didn't have.  We were in it, and we felt it, and we were ok with moving on.  He gave us a believable tension between old friends turned enemies, and he did so while maintaining the obvious chemistry the two shared.  He also didn't shy away from making taking the superheroes out of the comic book, steering away from any stigmas associated with the universe and giving us some bold and very human moments, especially considering Charles Xavier.  But, the one thing that he did best here is orchestrate a uniformly dynamic ensemble who all felt one with their characters and completely in this film.  Even Oscar winners like Berry and Lawrence or nominees like Fassbender and Jackman didn't once phone in these performances.  They obviously love these characters, and it shows.

There is a lot going on here, but it all comes together in a way that feels fluid and understandable.  For a film that I was truly scared was going to fail miserably, X-Men: Days of Future Past exceeded my expectations by a very large margin and remains one of the most exciting times I had watching a film this year.",1422316800,,3650,4.585516178736517

DAYS OF FUTURE PAST

I am a huge comic book fan and have enjoyed all the films that have been based on them, well almost all of them. Thankfully this is a really good X-Men flick that may be the best of the series; its between this one and First Class for me. The first three felt a little over stuffed with ideas and even characters where as these two were a little more refined, just a little though.

In this one the past meets the future with all mutants being hunted down and wiped out. So it is up to one Logan to go back and see if he can stop the event that lead to the probable extinction of his kind. So he is off and he must bring two former friends turned enemies not only back together but get them to work together as well. The only problem is that there is a certain young blue female they must get to and she is one of the reasons they no longer get along.

The action is spot on here as is the acting as you might expect, everyone from the previous films return and play it up like the previous. The story is fun so the film comes out really well. Sure it isn't a perfect flick but it is one of the best in the X-Men series including the Wolverine flicks. With that said the Blu-Ray comes with all kinds of special features that all should enjoy.",1421884800,,1269,4.027777777777778

556319,4,6303042503,"DoFP is easily my favorite X-Men movie at the moment. I've read the comic, and watched the 90s animated series version of it, so I'm well aware of the changes made to the movie, but they didn't detract from the well-written story and good follow-up with First Class that it is. Everyone on the cast does their absolute best within their roles, but I felt McAvoy and Fassbender really took the cake here in regards to acting.

Interesting scenes, while there were several, I am still amazed at how well done the jailbreak sequence with Quicksilver was. However, it would've been nice if a line or two were thrown in as to why he couldn't continue to help the rest of the group. The sentinels did a good job of showing how desperate a situation they made it for everyone in the future, but I would've liked a bit more insight as to they were largely unknown until this storyline. Also, even for a fictional movie based on a comic book, the future sentinels seemed downright impossible given their advanced technology, allowing them to have several mutant powers of their own, was modeled after Mystique's ability to 'appear' like other people.

This movie also stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, for the sixth time. I like the character of Wolverine/Logan/James Howlette(?)... but I like a lot of other X-Men characters too. I fully understand why he was given the lead role here, and it makes sense within the context presented in the movie as well, but let's face it, Fox simply can't compete with the Marvel(Disney) studios quality of movies of the last few years so why not bring in some more popular characters that fans can get equally attached to? Hopefully this is what happens in Age of Apocalypse, as well as the other stand-alone movies that have been announced/hinted at, but for the time being I will enjoy this golden age of comic movies for as long as it lasts. If you happen to be a fan of this genre I would definitely recommend checking out Days of Future Past.",1421625600,4,1975,4.6239316239316235

556435,4,6303042503,"Despite the goofy Moody Blues-style title, X-Men: Days of Future Past is, from start to finish, a total blast. Its well-paced and has a powerful score from John Ottman, recalling Hans Zimmer's work in Inception. A kinetic, energetic title sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film: this movie moves quickly and efficiently and understands the importance of brevity, which so many big blockbusters sadly dont. The best X-Men films (and this is certainly the best one since X2) are great because they know what their ambition should be; these films are not masterpieces, but they don't try to be (unlike Christopher Nolan's overrated, self-serious Batman trilogy). The special effects are easy to follow (and are not cluttered and chaotic like they are in Michael Bay's Transformers films) and are used to support a strong script, instead of trying to fill some void in a weak script.

In the year 2023, mankind and mutants are trapped in a futuristic dystopian world, and Wolverine is sent back to 1973 to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing Bolivar Trask (the great Peter Dinklage), a military scientist who designs Sentinels (robots that kill mutants). If Mystique goes through with the assassination, she will be captured and her powers will be stolen by the Sentinels, dooming humanity forever. In his 7th appearance as Wolverine (a record for the most times an actor has played the same comic book character onscreen), Hugh Jackman gives a very strong and believable performance.

The film handles the time period well, understanding the importance of restraint. A scene involving a basement, a ping pong table, a CRT Pong machine, and a young man in a ""Dark Side of the Moon"" shirt has some clever references and period details, but unlike Men in Black III, another film that involved time-travel to a similar era, the references in this film are humorous and, even more importantly, the film doesn't dwell on them. While the movie has fun with the era, it also uses these fun allusions mostly as a subtext for a well-constructed story and stunning action sequences.

In an amusing sequence, Wolverine wakes up in 1973, with a woman to his right and a lava lamp to his left. Folk music is playing in the background, and he discovers that he's sleeping in a water bed. He perfectly sells the confusion and navet Wolverine is experiencing. As Mystique, Jennifer Lawrence does a phenomenal job, handling her character's shape-shifting ubiquity with ease (just as she's done in her career). Sadly, Storm (Halle Berry) has all been all but written out of the film and only has a few lines of dialogue, which was very frustrating as a fan of the character and the actress.

Minor gripes aside, this is a terrific entertainment, and the setpieces are, without exception, phenomenal. One in particular stands out: a potential gun-fuelled bloodbath is about to start, and a member of the X-Men pauses time to walk around the room to reposition weapons, hands, and even eat food that is flying in the air, all to the sounds of Jim Croces Time in a Bottle. Its one of the most fun sequences Ive seen in some time, and the film is littered with many similar moments. Around the hour mark, as the film becomes more serious in tone as the mission grows more intense, the film remains just as enjoyable (Mark Camacho, playing Richard Nixon in full caricature mode, is very entertaining). Theres no wheel reinvention here; the film is just an exceptionally strong and well-crafted superhero film, pushing the limits of the genre to their furthest edges. Though I have superhero movie fatigue, this film revived my faith in the genre--or at least encouraged me to eagerly await the next X-Men film.",1421539200,,3703,4.882352941176471

I have always hated X3, simply because Mystique was screwed over, and Jean Grey was killed. I felt, back then, that they really cheated fans of the X-Men comics and cartoon at the end. Maybe, hopefully, someday, we'll get a better film devoted to Dark Phoenix, and how Jean comes to control her from this, because this film doesn't negate that storyline.

556596,4,6303042503,"This is a review about the product, not the movie itself which I think is great!! So I am going to say a few words about the extras included in this combo pack.

Deleted scenes. A few scenes that have nothing interesting to add. No wonder why they were cut out from the film! I was really hoping to see Rogue's scenes that we all know about. Unfortunately there is nothing from her.

Kitchen sequence. It should have been added to the gag reel. It is a complete waste of time unless you wan to see Jennifer Lawrence trying to get her scenes done but ultimately failing. This segment should have been split between deleted scenes and gag reel. I say this because we get to see Raven, Charles, Wolverine and Beast reunited back at the mansion's kitchen.

Gag reel. We all know what that is.

Double take: Xavier & Magneto. An interesting look at both characters, their young and elder versions. Last part is the most interesting, behind the scenes from the sequence where young Charles meets elder Charles in the future. To me that is a powerful scene between both actors and one of the best material from the extras.

X-Men reunited: the original cast, the new cast and the filmmakers share their insights about the x-men films. I enjoyed listening the original cast talking about coming back after so long.

Classification: M. Segment dedicated to the new mutants featured in the film's opening sequence. We get to see a bit about the visual effects and sound effects too. The finale is the most interesting though: we get to see how they filmed Quicksilver's slo-mo kitchen sequence.

Centinels: for a secure future. An interesting look into the technical side of the centinels. Concept art, practical and CG models, visual effects... All of that.

Gallery: trask industries. This one is really lame. There are 3 photo collections in this gallery, all of them are pretty small and have nothing interesting to add. These 3 are: Mutant Experiments (pictures like those Raven saw in Trask's office), Blueprints (from the sentinels), and Sentinel Construction (production stills from 70s sentinels).

Theatrical trailers: 3 trailers from this movie, all of them really cool.

Second screen app: First time I have ever downloaded this kind of stuff. I decided to give it a try because of the review, I loved it!! I did not have much expectations for it but here I got what was missing from the disc: new VFX behind the scenes, previs sequences, production stills and concept art (the most important to me!). The app also includes Cerebro, which is exactly the same that was included in First Class blu-ray. The app store description said it was updated but the characters from Days of future Past are not included in Cerebro. Still I recommend this app if you like to see behind the scenes content.

Sneal Peek of Exodus: Gods and Kings. Includes a 90-second sneak peek wich is disapointing, I was expecting something a bit longer. Also included is a 90-second teaser trailer which is as good as any other trailer from this movie.

So there is a lot of extra material on this disc. Still think that Fox (or whoever it was) did a better job on the X-Men First Class blu-ray. They had a very well structured documentary that tells the whole story about the film from pre-production to post. Here we get to see a bit of everything but it is not that well organized. There is nothing about casting the new characters, the script (I would have loved to see Matthew Vaughn talk about the story/script), or about the score (I am actually listening to it while writing this review). I you are like me and love to see concept art, previs, VFX stuff... I strongly recommend you download the Second Screen App.

About the downloadable movie: it is great!! I have the iTunes version on HD, english, spanish and frech audio available. And 30 different languages available as subtitles!!!

About the fan art booklet: It is interesting, not amazing. We get 7 art pieces from guys around the world including a few word from each of them.

In the end this is a product you should buy if you are a fan of the series and/or liked this particular movie. I am giving it 4 stars because I think the extra material could have been better. If you ask me if you should buy this product I would say: YES, I totally recommend it!!!",1421193600,4,4300,4.646903820816864

556667,1,6303042503,"Anyone else get a totally defective copy like I did?

My disc won't play and nothing will read it. I eventually got a replacement copy, returned that, then had to settle for a dvd format copy.  All of the Blu-ray copies are intentionally designed to not play in most players it seems.

First time I've EVER had an issue with anything in Blu-Ray format.

The movie itself is great.  I really enjoyed it.  On DVD.

  The bad rating is because of 20th Century Fox's corporate fascism with regard to the Blu-ray version of this release.

In the end I had to return 2 different Blu-ray copies for refunds and settle for a dvd copy.  As others have pointed out on Amazon. Com reviews - 20th Century Fox has seen fit to encrypt these discs with a special new copy protection.

A ""copy protection"" which for some reason also seems to be a PLAY PREVENTION encryption as well.

I can see no good or logical reason why a ""copy protection"" encryption should prevent anyone from being able to view this product and yet 20th Century Fox has seen fit to do this.  In fact, it's a good bet that what they've done is an illegal violation of consumer protection and fraud laws.

 From what I've learned you must have a player that is less than a year old in order to play this item.  Blu-ray recorders have been kept off of the North American market, and since our machines are only PLAYING the discs - the idea of a ""copy protection"" that prevents a person even playing a disc is insane and total over-kill, as well as being something way more than a simple copy protection.

 My Blu-ray player is connected to my tv.  No recording devices.  There is no reason why a ""copy protection"" encryption should be able to prevent me playing a disc like this.  Yet in the ultimate consumer rip-off 20th Century Fox has done what other retailers and people in the manufacturing industry would be in jail for.

  If you went to a gas station to fill up the tank of your vehicle and then turned the ignition and your vehicle would not start and the person on duty at the gas station told you that you needed to buy a new car in order for their ""copy protected"" gasoline to work in your vehicle you'd be marching right out to file a class action lawsuit.

And like I'm doing with 20th Century Fox, you'd be questioning the very sanity and motives of the people behind this.

I think someone should file a class action lawsuit against 20th Century Fox as they are doing pretty much the same thing.  Selling you a product that cannot be used in the normal means that the product is used.

  Trying to force people to not only pay them about $30 for a disc, but re-purchase a new Blu-ray player at between $80 and $100 - and for no good reason since the old machine still works fine - except for something they designed to intentionally not work, which when doing what it was designed to do (fail) means you can't play their one movie.  Who is going to replace a perfectly good Blu-ray player just to watch one movie?  Not many sane people I know.

 And guess who owns those companies who make those recording devices and the game boxes etc... - the same companies who own the tv networks and the movie studios - who encrypt our tv signals so we can't record them, all the while selling us expensive and useless dvd recorders, vcrs, and the like - and other media players - all the while preaching about how we NEED these things for time shifting and archiving etc...

It is unbridled greed 101.  They are not content to bleed us dry once or twice or a hundred times, they have to do so in every way possible.  Sell us machines that don't function as they are designed to, sell us dvds and blu ray discs that don't play, and sell us cable signals and programs we can't record or time-shift etc...  And somehow in all this it seems to be lost on them that we are paying them money to do these things.

There are nasty words for this sort of thing.  And there are consumer protection laws being broken here.  When you encrypt a product to NOT WORK or function as it is designed to - that is consumer fraud, among other things.  20th Century Fox are short-changing people and deceiving them.

I'm not talking about not being able to copy this disc, I am talking about NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY IT - in a device that is designed for nothing more than PLAYING such discs.  Doing so does not violate copyrights nor does it require copy protection.

I have no issue with encrypting to protect copyrights but this is something else.  We are also not talking about older players that have issues with playing newer double density discs with breaks in them or anything of that nature.

Just a product designed to be defective in most players.

It is a good bet that MOST people don't have a brand new Blu-ray player less than a year old.

My advice to everyone is to get the DVD version instead.  It will play fine.  I also suggest complaining about this to 20th Century Fox and anyone in law or government etc... who will listen.

Henceforth I plan to boycott any and ALL future releases by 20th Century Fox and stop buying those titles on Blu-ray (my preferred format).  DVD only for those items.

Clean up your act 20th Century Fox, your greed is getting the best of you and consumers are being screwed over in a big way.",1421107200,2,5278,4.374485596707819

They must stop the humans from getting Raven's DNA which allows them to build better mutant killing machines.

Only Logan/Wolverine Man (Hugh Jackman) can go back in time, or at least his mind.

Logan must get the team back together and convince them of the mission. Much of the film consisted of springing Magneto, which wittily included another era song by Jim Croce. Unfortunately they ran out of royalty checks and couldn't continue with that fun.

The action/comedy/drama was a let down from previous films. While the film maintained the special effects, I felt Jennifer Lawrence's acting talents were wasted, although I predict she will take over as the slow motion/ stop action mode blue skinned princess from that Avatar blue thing.

557765,5,6303042503,"A great X-Men story should have 2/3 tension and 1/3 humor. This X-Men movie hits that formula on the head. The only other X-Men cinematic experience to succeed at that was X-Men 2. This may not be from Marvel Studios, but it has the same quality. The superstars playing Charles Xavier and Magneto as old men are met equally by their counterparts playing both as young adults. The decision to limit the primary cast to Beast, Wolverine, Charles, and Magneto, with smaller roles played by Mystique and Quicksilver was smart. Too many characters dilutes the experience, and these are great characters.",1420416000,,598,4.930693069306931

557872,3,6303042503,"Wolverine gallops through time and space to deflect an ugly outcome for all of humanity, pausing frequently to give old cast members the time to wink directly into the camera and strut off set. I'm somewhat ashamed to admit I thought it was a rather large mess. The story had a lot of potential, especially in the unusual settings of both timelines, but it somewhat predictably gets tangled in the tripwires often associated with a time travel flick and spends far too much time delivering fan service when it should've been examining character motivations and further world-building. Trask and his sentinels barely play a supporting role in the proceedings, patsies at best, and I'm still struggling to comprehend Magneto's decision-making in the third act. It retains all of the unease-inspiring puns and goofball moments that I'd hoped the series could shed, making it feel dated and slightly pandering... a significant backtrack from the progress made in First Class. Even the built-in fireworks of the two heavyweight casts meeting face-to-face doesn't really work as well as it should. Seeing the new guys (McAvoy and Fassbender) alongside the old guard (Stewart and McKellen) didn't result in a torch-passing or spotlight the nuanced efforts that had so delighted me in the previous picture, it just made me yearn to see more of the senior guard. I mean, it's not all bad - the effects work is wonderful, it's a lot of fun spotting all the little love notes scattered about for hardcore fans, and the action roars along for a two-hour candyland cruise - but I had trouble shutting off my brain when earlier chapters hadn't been nearly so demanding in that department.",1420416000,3,1674,4.982142857142857

557989,3,6303042503,"It's a big movie with big themes and dark undertones, that are either done too intensely or veer off into unnecessary sidebars about who Mystique really loves. News flash: Mystique was never actually one of the X-Men, though it's obvious these producers desperately want her to be one. That's the least of my complaints, since her abilities are perfect for visual projects with lots of cute special effects like this movie has. And the stories get rewritten so many times who can keep track of who was who and whose side they were on?  On the plus side, the actors put in great performances all around.  On the minus there wasn't enough of Storm or most of the old team doing their thing. I can never figure out why they choose certain mutants to appear and others to be outright ignored: too many universes I guess, or maybe they just flip coins? Bit minus for this movie: the hyper-violent fight scenes between the last of the mutants and the Sentinals was a bit too graphic, and unnecessarily so: is this what gaming (xbox, etc) has brought on or does it really take this much blood and guts and screaming to get people interested these days?  X-Men stories used to have a bit more intelligence and subtlety to them, especially when imagining dystopian futures. But I'm a fan of the old-school X-men comic books (pre-Ultimate Universe and before Wolverine was in EVERYTHING). The only reason Wolverine got to go back instead of the professor or even Kitty is that Hugh Jackman's steely crazed gaze and massive biceps sell much more than telepathic bald men in wheelchairs and ghost girls. That said, I feel that in a better director's hands the horror of a world ruled by Sentinels would not have been lessened just because mutants weren't being ripped limb from limb in almost every instance. I gave it 3 stars because the possibility of humans unleashing Sentinels on the planet is a great cautionary tale on its own, but the one scene that tickled me was when (not really a spoiler for the 2 people who haven't seen this yet) a teenage, junk food addicted Quicksilver busted Magneto out of his prison and managed to stop time (from our perspectives) in doing so. That one scene of him zooming around a kitchen of people frozen in their simple normal speed made the whole movie worthwhile. I guess that's what special effects was created for...",1420329600,4,2349,4.682808716707021

The 3D effects were vey good, not great, but good is in itself great.  The cheesy effects of stuff flying at you at every turn of events were thin.

As a plot-line, I'm jaded by the use of time travel to reboot a universe and give a free pass to bring old characters played by the same actors back to life. The best part was the introduction to the mutant who could move really fast and the scene dedicated to his skills was fantastically done.",1420243200,,446,4.658227848101266

558994,4,6303042503,"A good 4-star X-Men movie, which is remarkably better than it's predecessors. Aside from the fact that the traditional ""Days of Future Past"" storyline was altered drastically, and the fact that in the end, the team is in a situation that was never in the comics, it went a long was as far as resolving so many of the terrible inconsistencies of the previous X-Men movies. If you are not a true X-Men comic book fan, but a big fan of the movies, then you would probably give this 5 stars, but if you are a big fan of the comics and know the storylines, the team scenarios, etc... then it's difficult to stomach some of the liberties that Fox took when writing this. This still doesn't resolve the absolutely terrible non-canonical ""X-Men First Class"", nothing could fix how badly that movie screwed things up except for a total reboot or totally removing it from your memory. That said, it essentially erases many blunders from the first two X-Men movies.",1420156800,,954,4.617647058823529

The plot (which I assume came from the comic books) was inventive, and the ending reminded me of the beginning of J.J. Abram's first Star Trek movie.  I might quibble with the PG-13 rating if I hadn't seen James Cameron's Titanic, which had every curse word I'd ever heard and frontal nudity to boot.  This movie had full back nudity, suggested unmarried sex, the F-bomb, and drug use -- and that was the good guys!

559111,4,6303042503,"It has that First Class vibe, mostly because of being set in the same timeline. However, action is more and boring is less.

Hugh Jackman, James Macavoy, Evan Peters, and Michael Fassbender's performances were great, and the story was the most faithful to the comic book canon of any of the other films, with the exception of perhaps The Wolverine. This was essentially a series reboot that delivered on a lot of things. It isn't as funny and witty as say, The Avengers, but of the X-Men films, I felt this was the best to date.

559495,4,6303042503,"This is my new favorite X-Men movie.  It has its flaws, but that seems to come with the territory in this franchise.  I sometimes wish it wasn't AS Wolverine-based, but he does such a great job that its not a true complaint.  It looks incredible, has wonderful acting, and is a little less cheesy than First Class.

my favs in order:

DOFP
X2
First Class
X1
X3
The Wolverine
Origins Wolverine",1419984000,2,392,4.464788732394366
559496,4,6303042503,"X-men days of future past is probably the best X-Men movie yet. The acting is good. The plot is mostly decent, with a few weak points. The movie starts right in the middle of a battle in the future where sentinels rule and mutants are all in concentration camps. Doctor Xavier is somehow alive too. How convenient. Kitty sends wolverine into the 70's to stop mystique from killing an evil dwarf. Wolverines goes to Xavier's school and finds the docter all drunk and powerless. They shop the evil dwarf and drop a baseball stadium on the white house. Everything is fine and no one dies. The ending is annoyingly cheerful, with everyone living happily ever after, but the movie is overall a good buy.",1419984000,,698,4.637096774193548

559602,3,6303042503,"It's okay.  It was nice to see some of the old cast again, but the movie left a lot of unanswered questions, like how did the professor come back from the dead?  It was a bit hard to follow the sequences of events when Wolverine went back in time, because the scenes didn't flow smoothly from one to another, they jumped around.  Overall, it was okay.  Kind of a weird plot/storyline (I think someone watched the Terminator movies too many times), but the acting was ok.  Plenty of action.  While we like the X-Men movies and have all of them, I think they've pretty much beaten the X-Men franchise to death.  I would recommend this if you're an X-Men fan or if you looking for a decent action movie.",1419897600,4,700,4.37984496124031

Easily the best xmen movie to date with a strong story and excellent cast. The 1080p transfer is gorgeous and the 7.1 audio is superb.  The film uses the time travel angle to go back and fix all the problems the last few xmen films had that fans did not like. I highly recommend this film to anyone not just comic book movie fans.",1419897600,,577,4.097345132743363

Some people complain that they ignore canon or are simply ""doing it wrong,"" but I prefer to be flexible with things like that.

561771,5,6303042503,"This is arguably the best X-Men movie to date. I was not a fan of Ratner's X-Men 3 (Bryan Singer was off doing Superman Returns), and was ecstatic that it got retconned. I love every other X-Men title thought. Singer did not direct First Class, but he did help create the story for it. I was extremely excited when I learned he was directing this one!

As for the movie, it is top-notch. A key component in the series is Wolverine and his constant action-filled sequences. What was great here - that few people have noted - is that this movie still made Wolverine important without the need to always have him fighting. The story, the character development, the usage of flash forwards to create suspense, all help make this a phenomenal movie. I don't really want to go into great detail about the movie in case you have yet to see it. But suffice to say, you will be quite pleased if you have found the other X-Men titles enjoyable. And keep an eye out for Apocalypse...

While the actual comics center on Kitty Pride going into the past, I felt that Singer anticipated that the public would want someone they were more familiar with. Who better to use than Wolverine? And with the way the explanation goes - and still incorporates Kitty playing a significant role - it makes perfect sense to me.

As for the Blu-ray itself, I can't comment. I have yet to actually open and watch it, I only watched the movie in the theaters. The reason I wanted to write a review was because of how I came to get this Blu-ray:

A couple months ago there was a X-Men & Wolverine collection for around $30. I only buy Blu-ray movies in collections or sets, so I thought this was a good offer considering Days of Future Past had only recently been released and would likely not be a part of any collection for some time. A month and a day later, the same collection went up for sale with Days of Future Past. I was pretty upset since the collection was maybe $2-$3 in difference.

The only thing I could think of was to call Amazon and ask if I could get the additional movie for the difference, a long shot, but my ego wouldn't let it go without at least trying. I called Amazon and explained the situation a few times before they understood exactly what I was asking. They put me on hold for a few minutes, then told me that I could go ahead and pay for the Blu-ray at full price and call them back for a refund less the difference of the two collection prices. I immediately paid and called about a week later to hound them on the refund. It took a bit of time for the person to understand the situation (again), but I ended up getting the movie for about $2! This is why I love Amazon, their service and customer support always pull through for a return customer like myself.",1419033600,,2762,4.344961240310077

561815,5,6303042503,"A refreshing reboot!  I've heard many a scoff at the go-back-and-do-it-again trend, but why?  All possibilities are... possible. In comics, characters are always popping up in one another's story.  It's an old folk tradition of passing stories and heroes, each bard and each generation adding and editing.  Who hasn't considered the idea: ""But what if this had happened THAT way?"" or ""What if these two had a secret past?""  It's all very thrilling, really.  Perhaps you're happy to see Scott and Jean again or more behind-the-brawl of Magneto and Mystique.  The Bobby-n-Rogue v. Bobby-n-Kitty is worth a chat over coffee.  Personally, I'm ecstatic to be able to put the unforgivable Bowdlerization - Wolverine fighting robots in Asia - out of my mind.  It never happened - yay!",1419033600,,777,5.05511811023622

I liked this movie but I think I was expecting so much more and felt slighted after watching it. I am not one who ventures to the movie theaters, but this is the first from the Marvel franchise that I did not see in the theater and I am glad of that fact.

561934,5,6303042503,"Wow, they really opened up story lines like crazy in this one--to keep the franchise going, no doubt!  Not a problem, as I love the X-Men as much as I love bacon.  Loved seeing Xavier as a person struggling, instead of his omniscient, preachy self from the other movies.  Magneto was different too, and I can't really say much about some of the action or the characters without plot spoiling.  Some of the sentinel scenes were awkward, but again, that's plot spoiling and wrong to talk about.  Mystique was central to this movie and what happened between other characters in the way Wolverine and Jean Gray were more focused on, in the other films.  Wolverine had a more reflective, controlled vibe in this, so again, they really developed the script and plot to get us more in depth with the characters than in the past.  I thought it was fun to have trippy time travel also.  And that's all the plot spoiling I'll do.  I liked this movie a lot, so I bought it.

Evan Peters has a nice turn as Quicksilver, but don't blink because you might miss him.

1) This series is evolving into a Wolverine and the X-Men franchises. As much fun as he is and the ""Uber-Id is very cool, they need some more balance.

2) I am a 64 year old fan boy who returns to his youth every time I view these. However, the complications and arcane plot twists are becoming a little too prevalent.

The reason for my rating is that yes, while I am a fan of them all- marvel #1- I was tortured by Mystique flooding the movie. No offense to the Hunger Games actress, but no one will ever pull off Mystique better than Rebecca Romaine Stamos (apology for misspelling).
The other scratching my head moments have to do with casting issues who may be different actors in entertwined movies as same character. For example, silver surfer or quick silver as actor 1, but same character as actor 2 in another movie compiling as Avenger. Confusing!

The movie blew me away and let's just say Quicksilver had the best scene of the entire movie. Hugh Jackman did what Hugh Jackman does. He never disappoints as Xmen favorite Wolverine.

I told my husband who did not hesitate to remind me that he loves me but that he cAN eAsily see why my quiz profile Answers mAtched that of MAgneto.  In my husbAnds defense, he knows me better thAn even my own fAmily members And hAs seen All sides of me that I reluctantly Admit that I cArefully hide from the online And offline public (for good reAsons).  Anyhow, please know that I do feel that mAny of the Actors And Actresses of the All stAr cAst contributed in A strong wAY to X-men Days of Future pAst.  However, the plot of the chArActers hAving to travel in the pAst helped me to further understand And enjoy MichAel FAssbenders portrayal As MAgneto And yet Also feeling sympathy for the character that Jennifer lAwrence portrayed As Raven DArkholme/Mystique. There Are Also A lot of Action scenes that Are set near And in the white house And it wAs nice to see All of the chArActers uniting together As A team in the movie, even when it is AppArent that some hold ulterior motives. For some reason, there is Also strength displayed when the chArActers combine their powers to mAke trAveling bAck in time possible.

There were two things that originally disappointed me about this movie. One was I didn't understand how Wolverine got his metal claws back after the conclusion of ""The Wolverine"" but, I guess if they can bring Professor X back from the dead and Magneto can get his full powers back after ""The last stand"" then I guess they found away to give Wolverine his metal claws back. The second thing is when Wolverine went into the past and at the very end when the X-Men of the past started fighting sentinels I wanted to see Wolverine fight one and take his head clean off and tear it to pieces. But I also got over that when I bought the movie on DVD and watched it again.

565948,1,6303042503,"Do not buy this version!!!
I loved the movie and bought this as soon as it was released. Stupid me. Fox loves to cheat us out of our money. It does not have all the deleted scenes-- namely, all of the scenes with Rogue that were filmed at not included. The other thing I was looking forward to watching was seeing how they filmed the slow motion scene. When I played ""The Kitchen Sequence"", thinking I would see the slow motion making of, I instead saw another deleted scene of Charles and Raven talking in the kitchen at his house. I think this was done so purposely to mislead you. Why have a section of deleted scenes then this one separately labeled vaguely as the kitchen scene knowing full well the slow motion scene took place in the kitchen at Magnetos prison. Whatever fox, I'm selling this and waiting until I can get the directors cut used so fox doesn't get any additional profits from me.",1417910400,11,901,4.433734939759036

I have to say this is one of the best movies to come out this year let alone comic book movies of all time. Bryan Singer fixes a lot of the plot holes and mess created by the last stand but does it in a masterful way. One of the most beloved Xmen stories comes to life on the big screen, bringing all these characters together from the older xmen movies with the xmen first class cast to face and change the horrible and doomed future. Both sides of the cast acting really shines through in this movie going in places never seen in a xmen movie before and bringing back the vibe and spirit of great xmen movies of the past.",1417910400,,730,4.041379310344827

566726,2,6303042503,"I was stunned that this movie did not hold my attention enough to watch it to the end. I've enjoyed previous films in the X-men suite, most especially First Class, and approached this one with considerable anticipation given the juxtaposition of past and future that it promised. But the plotting was surprisingly poor. Lehnsherr makes an inexplicably stupid move, even if we accept his stated motivation, which in itself is questionable given past history, current situation and his own statements in the preceding scene. Yes that stupid move sets up most of the drama to follow, but please, you can't have people doing dumb things just to set up the rest of the action. That is poor, poor plotting. All the character dynamics that I was hoping for, with the past and future selves, never materialized. We are given sappy platitudes instead. Or maybe it got better toward the end, and maybe I will go back and slog through to find out. But as of now, all I saw were a lot of splashy special effects (I will give high marks to the scene with the fast boy), and mayhem that was AVOIDABLE if people had just not been stupid. Stupid does not equal tragic flaw leading to inevitable fate. Stupid is just stupid. Sorely and sadly disappointed.",1417651200,5,1238,4.68348623853211

566728,5,6303042503,"I don't usually like time travel movies. It's a plot gimmick that's just too convenient and it's kinda over-used in the sci-fi genre. With that said I love Superhero movies and this one is great. X-Men are a fantastic team and Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are good but I felt Ian McKellan was under-utilized and I would have liked to have seen more from him and the younger Magneto too (I forget his name). This movie belongs to the shape-shifting Mystique. More specifically it's Jennifer Lawrence who steals the show. She is charming, super-sexy and I can't stop looking at her, even through all that blue makeup.
Jennifer Lawrence is a Hottie!",1417651200,,650,4.761061946902655

James McAvoy is the standout - he's great, especially at conveying Xavier's self-loathing when Logan first encounters him in the '70s. The time travel elements are well-handled for the most part.

566874,5,6303042503,"I normally don't like to write reviews on movies since it mostly depends on personal taste.  I also don't want to inadvertently spoil anything for future viewers.  I thought a review on this product might be helpful to viewers that own OPPO BDP-83 players since a firmware release was required for me to play it.  I was lucky enough to attempt to watch it on the day the firmware was issued (BDP83-60-1110, November 26,2014).  Without the update, the disc would be ejected with the error "" Wrong Disc"".  Check the OPPO website for more information and the latest firmware if you encounter this issue.  They sent me an e-mail about it one week after I had already solved the problem and watched the movie.

I really enjoyed this movie.  I would say that it tied the 2nd X-men movie as my favorite but I would need to watch them all again to be sure.  I think my favorite fight scenes in any movie or TV show involve intelligent teamwork (Heroes, X-Men series, Fantastic4, etc.).  The teamwork in the fight scenes was so smooth and fast paced that I had to watch the sequences several times to appreciate what they were doing.  I also really liked a scene that involved no teamwork at all.  The slow motion Pentagon escape was just incredible to watch in HD and very funny as well.

I purchased the box set that I believe was a Gold Box deal.  I was surprised that they have already made 7 X-Men/Wolverine movies.  I lost track over the years.  It looks like another one is in pre-production so they clearly have no plans to stop.  If you like the series, this one is worth watching.",1417651200,,1581,4.472027972027972

567426,5,6303042503,"This movie was seriously freaking awesome! I have always loved the X-Men movies and I knew that at the end of wolverine in Japan when he ran into magneto and Prof. X in the airport that they were going to put on a great movie for us. This movie had it all!!!!!!!
The young Prof. X puts on a heck of an emotional performance. It was beautiful seeing a lot of the old cast. I still am angry at Anna Paquin's character for getting that shot that takes away her mutant abilities early on in the series, because she would've been great in this movie meeting up with her old boyfriend and frenemy.
I love Wolverines character. And I love the young Eric/magneto. Even Mystique I absolutely adore learning what made her tick!
There's so many great scenes in this movie and so many great messages. I've always wished that I had a mutant ability. Mutant  and proud!
I wonder what they are going to come up with next. Because it's obvious Prof. X and magneto are getting up there in age and they do not have Logan's ability of not aging. There was one sad part where the character of Mistique found out what happened to her old gang  the red Devil guy, The fairy girl that could spit fire balls, the ice crystal girl, etc.

567575,4,6303042503,"There is something about American Culture that is stuck in the 1960s and 1970s.  Not too long ago, this reviewer was in a ""trendy"" shop that seemed to specialize in ""trendy"" posters, nick-nacks, and other such junk.  All such junk was right out of the late 1960s and early 1970s.  This movie, X-Men: Days of Futures Past, makes a big point to bring the time frame of the movie to that era.

Other than to say the hey-day of the X-Men comic book series was in that time-it is remarkable that there seems to be such a cultural rut.

To really, get this movie one needs to know who all the characters in the X-Men are and what powers and personal rivalries they have.  The movie starts as the mutants battle their enemies in their final refuge.  They then send Wolverine back to the past to avoid the war in the first place.

The best character in the movie is Dr. Bolivar Trask, expertly played by Peter Dinklage.  Trask is the perfect relentless villain.

The first three movies were a bit too childish and cartoony-like for my tastes.  I like how the producers and director contrasts the visuals of the present and the past.  While the present is dark and dismal...the past is bright and cheery.  In fact, I kept hoping to see more of the dark and dismal present because of the interesting characters which dwelled there. I think the public is ready for more dark and sinister X-Men characters.  The original characters are getting older, and one wonders will they be killed off, or just retire?  I hope they keep all of the characters...allowing them to age while bringing in exciting new ones.",1417305600,,753,4.666666666666667

What i don't really like is the rather chintzy cheap treatment the BRs are getting from the studios these days.  There is a digital copy but no DVD and there's almost no extra features.  The extras consist of just a few deleted scenes with commentary.  Why even bother?  It's one of the reasons I buy the discs rather than just streaming the movie directly from Amazon or one of the other vendors.

That said, this really looks like a trend in movies released on disc as I noted that Captain America: The Winter Soldier got pretty much the same treatment on the disc version.  Really disappointing.",1417305600,,749,4.628787878787879

I will say Quicksilver easily steals the best scene in the movie and is one of the best moments of any superhero movie.  It also sets up well for the next movie that is already in production.

As for my title, there is something that occurs during this movie that makes me feel better about the last stand so I won't give it away, but this movie makes the entire Saga more meaningful.

568732,5,6303042503,"I am one of those guys who read the original comics when they came out; I had to suffer through a month of waiting for x-men 142 to come out to complete the amazing story, finally purchasing the issue from the spinner comic rack in the newsstand and devouring the story panel by panel in awe as a 11 year old kid.

So initially I had high expectations. And that scared me - I figured there was no way I would be ""satisfied"" so I just watched the film after finally flushing those expectations down the proverbial toilet. Come to find out I could have saved some water. Ha!

What I am saying is - this is the big one: the best ""superhero"" movie to come out yet, IMO ...

Name a better one. Seriously. This one has the look, the acting, the story weirdness trippy effect of a comic, humor, intrigue, and it stitches together the other x-men films. Wow! I am a harsh critic generally so well done!

Perfect casting, good balance of effects to storytelling, good adherence to the original story while still making a watchable movie over 30 years later in a genre that is constantly unsure of how to self-represent ... Either spoofing itself by making fun of the underwear on top of the pants originals or becoming a spoof by not having a sense of humor or sense of reality. What I mean is it is a tricky balance to find the superhero sweet spot in film, apparently.

This one finds that spot. And lights it up like a pinball wizard on its best machine.

I only have one problem and it is a big one. The credits! How can they put up all these names of contributors to this film without listing Claremont and Byrne? Come on man!!! They dreamt up the story, not these other people! Sheesh !! This story was later repeated as back to the future and terminator, but it all started here, and the creators get no credit? For shame guys!

A+ all in all.

Tons of action, things getting blown up, and mounds of fighting scenes. There were a couple of boring moments, or where it got a little sappy for me, but thankfully those moments didn't last long.
Not a movie for the whole family, unless your youngest kids are pre-teens. Them and up will definitely enjoy it!

The battle scenes with the 'future' X-Men vs. the Sentinels were very entertaining to watch, even though the overall battle is pretty one-sided. Those scenes make the plot involving Trask, Mystique and the Sentinels that much more compelling to watch. The addition of Quicksilver to this movie was also a nice touch - especially his kitchen scene. Another plus was that the ending of this movie served to erase the gratuitous X-Man deaths from the earlier X-Men movie, The Last Stand.

Marvel Studios wisely avoided this route in its movies and what's why it beats everyone else over the head in a race to the finish. There's little real violence, there's no explanation given for how Wolverine knows Quicksilver and you'd have to have been familiar with the comics to know who he is. The sentinels are a disgrace along with the one sided battles against the mutants they are sent to terminate. The explanation of JFK's assassination is a real hoot along with Mystique's quest to take out Trask. There is no real mystery here. Also the question begs to be asked at the end, why is Mystique trying to cultivate Logan when the last time they met - he buried his claws in her stomach. Very romantic  .  .  .

Doesn't give you a lot of details in what these new sentinels are made of that makes them so invulnerable? The ending with magneto going through all the trouble to hijack the sentinel train and reprogram them then after flying a baseball stadium to the White House only one sentinel fights with him and it isn't much of a fight just wolvie and beast getting tossed around. Wolvie isn't much with his bone claws so he doesn't do much damage to anything. He did somehow have his metal claws again in the future but that too is not explained. I was expecting more fights and action against the sentinels. I did like the future sentinels, they did a good job on those but not a lot of screen time for them. Disappointed they didn't have victor creed in it, remember he and wolvie served in every war for hundreds of years together.
