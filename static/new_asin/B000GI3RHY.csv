The sadistic scenes are very straight-forward but made successful.

Except that Male actor of overall exaggerating acting which made me feel uncomfortable whenever he said or moved.",1160870400,2,350,5.345454545454546
2613753,4,B000GI3RHY,"First, let me say I loved this movie. It was the first movie that was so grotesque that I had to turn away. I would of loved it even more however, if they did not cast whomever that washed up actor was in one of the lead roles. He was over acting and very dull. I wasn't the least bit interested in hearing from him in fact I found him to be quite annoying at times yelling like some dumb wino who has never acted in his life. The rest of the cast was excellent. I would of just liked to see mike play more on the ghost that was present in the room in the beginning of the film to add some horror aspects to the movie instead of just shock factors by showing dead fetuses and such. Overall, it was pretty interesting just next time I hope he picks a better male actor.",1160784000,5,768,3.9612903225806453
2613754,4,B000GI3RHY,"Unlike how some of Miike's other work is, this is not slow at all.  The pace of the movie goes quickly, actually I was wanting more.  This movie isn't gruesome but it's not for the squeemish.  A scene involving needles and fingertips made me cringe moreso then the abortion scenes.  This is a very cruel and mesmorizing movie that holds your attention *no pun intended* until the end.  My only complaint is that Miike made the end of the film a little too out there.  I think if he would have ended it on more realistic terms, like how the movie leads you on, the end would have had more of an impact.",1160611200,4,601,4.274336283185841
2613755,4,B000GI3RHY,"Ah, the infamous banned episode of Masters Of Horror.  This kinda got some fans angry coz this was a series that was supposed to be no holds barred and allowed directors to make whatever the hell they wanted.  We caught the first glimpse of censorship with Argento's episode Jenifer, but who knew they'd ban a whole episode?  Is the episode really that gruesome?  I'm sure many folks are very curious about that.  Unfortunately, the answer's ""no"".  All hype, all talk.  There is absolutely no reason why this episode couldn't have been aired... not one.  I know the idea of what's extreme varies from person to person, but there were reviews written by critics, who review horror films exclusively, that thought this was an insane amount of violence.  Almost every review I've read says the first 30-40 minutes puts you in a false sense of security, then the last 20 minutes is a nonstop gorefest.  Were these people watching a different movie than me?  What's with the mass hysteria?  Now, I'm not some tough guy who claims nothing can unsettle or shock me, but even my wife said it wasn't all that graphic, and she gets queasy watching CSI and House.  The only reason for the ban was because the topic of abortion in the states is about as hot as a two peckered billygoat.  Rubber fetuses thrown into a river is wayyyyyyy over the line.  But torturing prostitutes, drilling out women's eyes(Coscarelli's episode), eating a teenager's penis(Argento's), having a baby get eaten by a rat(Gordon's) and running your intestines though a film projector(Carpenter's) are all fine and wholesome enough.  Oh, well.  Is the movie good?  Opinions vary, but I thought the film was actually pretty good.  I honestly never cared much for Miike's style, but I always respected the guy, and I did like this one.  Though it will only appeal to horror fans I wouldn't call it a horror film.  I never found it boring though, I stayed interested in the story.  And above all I'm a big fan of Billy Drago.  Imprint may not live up to it's notoriety, but the trip is worth taking....if you're asking me that is.",1160265600,8,2091,4.7154696132596685
2613756,3,B000GI3RHY,"At the outset, let me assure you that I dig horror movies and I think Takeshi Miike is a mad genius.  That being said, ""Imprint"" is not very good.  Sure, it's interesting (what Miike film isn't?) and there are some mindblowing sequences.  But the acting is terrible (it's in English; Miike doesn't speak English - see the problem?), the story is, well, stupid (just lame, seriously), and it's more over the top than it needs to be (and yes, I realize I am reviewing a Miike film, so the term ""over the top"" has almost no meaning - and I'm still saying this is too much).  It succeeds insofar as being an ""oh dead God, why am I watching this?"" sort of thing, and that in itself is something.  But it's no fun, there's no point, and . . . well, I was disappointed.  Too bad, that, because the very idea of Miike making an episode of MoH for Showtime that was too disgusting to be aired was truly delicious.  Unfortunately, it appears that the reason they refused to air it was because it's just not very good and too f---ing disgusting for words.  Watch only if you're a Miike fan and just want to chuckle at the outright lunacy of the guy.",1159574400,,1138,4.309859154929577
2613757,4,B000GI3RHY,"This was a fairly ""enjoyable"" bit from Miike, the horror is more disturbing than ""scary"". It's probably more horrific to know that women actually lived in terrible conditions like these during Japan's Meiji Period. It would also have been better in the actors' native Japanese, but most American audiences simply aren't going to watch anything with subtitles, no matter how good the movie. When I saw Jet Li's ""Fearless"", a number of people walked out as soon as the subtitles rolled! I am giving it 4 stars only because I am getting exasperated with these commentaries from pretentious film ""experts"","" not related to the production, which the studios insist on adding to nearly every DVD that comes out. Fifteen minutes into the commentary track on this one, and these people don't sound at all interested in the film, or even seem to think that it's very good. Why are they commenting in the first place? NOT a good marketing idea if the studios want people to buy their DVDs. If the DVD will be cheaper, I can skip all the photo galleries, trailers, music videos, and other junk that's padded onto a DVD nowadays. The film is good enough, please!",1159488000,4,1150,4.755

Of the other ""Masters of Horror"" bore fests the only other ones worth watching were Incidents On and Off a Mountain Road and Cigarette Burns- and only Cigarette Burns from those two would be worth buying.  Back to Imprint- it was banned for a reason- or perhaps multiple reasons- after the first half hour you're wondering what all the fuss was about- it seems a little creepy and the acting isn't so great- from the half hour mark however it turns into an extremely violent carnivalesque freak show - me and my girlfriend are major horror buffs and she was cringing repeatedly- and it's not the violence or the over the top viscera that makes it so great- it's the visual style of Miike as well that propels this- images born from a nightmare that you won't be able to toss from your mind any time soon- In this form Miike is like an Asian David Lynch on acid- great stuff- and don't watch this one with children or the weak of stomach...",1159315200,7,1050,4.374358974358974
2613760,5,B000GI3RHY,"this is what you get when you tell directer MIIKE he can do whatever he likes! this is miike at his relentless best, not shying away from gore, sadism, and brutality. Imprint is the story of a man looking for his lost love that happens to be last seen working in a whore house. Upon visiting the whore house he is confronted by a whore with a disfigured face that seems to know more than she's telling about the whereabouts of the mans lost love. From there, it's a trip down memory lane as she discribes the fate of his lost love and also her own demented past. This film is perfect in every way. Miike had his japanese actors learn english for this film- and believe me, it add's even more of a creepy feel to the movie. Don't think twice, get it! Also included on the dvd (as with all the masters of horror films) is an interview with the director, an interview with the writer of the book the film was based on, and some behind the scenes footage on location in Japan. This film is what bad dreams are made of- picture david lynch doing a film in japan and you have the sorta feel miike has created.

be warned- this film contains graphic displays of violence, torture, and abortion.",1159315200,4,1187,4.299107142857143
2613761,4,B000GI3RHY,"I don't know how some can not call this a horror film. It's true that it doesn't have many scary moments, but it does have some very disturbing scenes including abortion, torture, incest, and just plain insanity that would make your jaw drop. I don't consider myself a Takeshi Miike expert but I have enjoyed the few films I have seen by him and I enjoy this movie just the same. But the movies biggest flaw is the slow beginning and some of the poor English of the Japanese actresses.

I don't think Billy Drago did a bad job like some have said. He has a great presence on screen and he plays the character subtle in the beginning until more of the story is revealed and his true self is shown. The mostly all Japanese cast does an OK job. Their English is decent at best. The only actress that stands out is the one that plays the disfigured prostitute who does a masterful job of being not only creepy but likable at the same time.

If you a fan of Miike then this is a must buy. It also has a great interview with him where he talks about his process of directing and how he approaches projects. I highly recommend this film.",1159228800,4,1130,4.251162790697674

2613767,4,B000GI3RHY,"""Imprint"" has the distinction of being the only episode in this now extinct series to be banned from TV. After finally watching it, I can understand the hype and controversy. This is, hands down, the most unpleasant and disgusting entry in the Season 1 catalogue and that is saying a lot since many of these episodes pile on the gore, nudity and general sleaze.

The story centres around Christopher (Billy Drago) who travels to a mysterious island in 19th century Japan. He is searching for a long lost love, a young prostitute, Komomo (Michie), whom he had an affair with years earlier. He ends up taking refuge in a bordello, where a young, deformed courtesan (Youki Kudoh) keeps him company. Upon his request, she begins telling him stories of her past, her relationships with her family and sisters of the night and culminates with an outrageous tale of woe, torture, humiliation and death as she reveals the fate of his beloved Komomo. At first, the deformed temptress appears inoffensive, unremarkable, but that soon changes after Christopher calls her out on the truthfulness of her story. Through her sinister ramblings, he learns the true fate of his lover and uncovers the dark secrets harbored by this twisted and malevolent courtesan who is telling the tale.

There is no taboo subject matter that is left untouched by Takashi Miike in this slimy and offensive short film. It's all here in all of its shocking, grisly, offensive glory. The filmakers must have had quite the checklist when creating this piece- Abortion? Check. Incest? Check. Murder? Check. Rape? Check. Did I leave anything out? Oh yes, torture? Check. Those that are sensitive to dark subject matter should stay away. Those that can stomach this sort of thing, and if you are a fan of the series, then you most certainly can, this film is highly recommended. It is beautifully shot with vivid rich colours and sumptuous period costumes. Most of the performances are good. Michie is great as the tragic Komomo and Youki Kudoh's wicked performance is a scene stealer. The only performance that I found a bit disappointing is Drago's and his over the top dramatics however considering what is going on, I guess it's understandable. He most definitely looks the part and fits right into his surroundings.

Those wanting to experience a new kind of horror film, I guess ""Imprint"" is the movie for you. Aside from being unpleasant, extremely disgusting, gory, offensive, rude, crude, insensitive, shocking (did I leave any words out?), it is still a slick and sometimes polished horror film that is pretty well made, with nice location shots, costumes and good performances. The film is nasty but what did you expect from ""Master's of Horror"" and Miike? Definitely one of the better efforts from Season 1 and the most revolting.

Recommended but be prepared to be disgusted.",1379376000,,2849,4.941544885177453

2613771,4,B000GI3RHY,"Despite the somewhat confusing ending, I really enjoyed Imprint. I have been a fan of Asian horror and especially of Miike. The torture scenes are on par with everything else he has done and you can't help but squirm in your seat. The saddest part of the story had to be the abortion scenes. I think that it affected me more than the torture did. I can definitely see why this was banned and by the reviews, a lot of people were shocked, so it did it's job! If you are a fan of Takashi Miike, you will find this story on par with his other work. If you have never seen anything by him, you are in for a shock!

2613772,1,B000GI3RHY,"I love horror.  I watch it all the time.  This episode of MOH of just too much for me.  The torture scene which some people found ridiculous or funny, I found horrifying.  I actually cried.  I can think of reasons why this movie could have some value if it were a movie about how terrible violence against women is.  But it's not.  It's supposed to be entertainment.  What's terrifying and heart wrenching in watching this is that women are treated this way in real life, all around the world.  It's not funny, it's not ridiculous, it's gut wrenching.  Maybe that's what the director is going for.  I suppose I try to see what directors are trying to accomplish when they make movies such as these...I'm thinking the original Last House on the Left (which, frankly seemed like a kid's movie in comparison) as another example.  I don't know.  Although I did see an interview with Wes Craven where he said he wasn't sure he would have made Last House on the Left if he had the family he does now.

Anyway...

To me horror is entertainment when it taps into our fears of the unknown and supernatural.  Explicit torture and sexual violence against women are all too real.  So, if you feel similarly, watch something else.",1316736000,3,1217,4.560185185185185
2613773,1,B000GI3RHY,"Wow I really hate to give anything one star, but more than that I really hate to spend an hour of my life doing something and then immediately want that hour back.
I am a horror fan! This was not horror! This was shock and gore and just plain ickiness.

I liked ""Audition"" and felt the intense scenes were justified to support the story, but here I felt like I was just trying to be shocked.
Give me a story to pull me along and make me feel fear and dread! I just kept feeling gross, watching black toothed ugly people and needles all over the place.

It made me realize that TO ME (which is only MY opinion) what is a great horror movie can be one that doesn't have to be in your face to scare you. You can never see one drop of blood and be scared silly- THAT's a great horror movie. Which is not to say I do not enjoy seeing blood and gore- I do!- when there's a time and place for it- not for the sake of just seeing it.

And sorry Billy Drago fans, but what the hell kind of a performance was that?  He acted like John Wayne on acid and halfway through a sex change. Talk about over-acting! That in itself was off-putting.

So, having never given anything ONE star before, let me just apologize to fans of Miike, Billy Drago, and this installment of what I have found to be a very entertaining series. I am only one person, this is only one opinion.

I'm not finding any clues doing google searches.  I found a suggestion the story came from a Japanese writer named Shimako Iwai and the story was Bokkee Kyotee (Really Terrifying), but I can't find the story itself so I can read it.  Frustrating.  I'm trying to piece things together, but not having much luck.  Sure, it may be open to interpretation, but I'd like to hear some of those interpretations.  I was an English major a long time ago, but I'm not the best at 'reading movies' for clues the same way I can read and interpret a text.  Any thoughts?",1313107200,,690,4.560975609756097
2613775,5,B000GI3RHY,"Wow! This is WAY more intense than any of the other entries from the MoH series. In fact, Miike proves he's not simply a master of horror, but rather has his doctorate. The film begins with our arrival across corpse-ridden waters into a realm that is a blend of ancient Nippon and Hell. Nothing here is beautiful, including the twisted courtesans. One in particular becomes our unreliable narrator. The girl's stories are fascinating, from her variations of what happened to Komomo to her own freakish origin. The things shown in this film are rather extreme, even by horror standards (or even anime for that matter). I challenge you to not cringe during the distinctly japanese binding / torture scene, which reminded me of some of Lucio Fulci's classic gore. Though there is some seriously grotesque imagery at play here, ""Imprint"" delivers what many modern horror pieces do not: an engaging story. The extreme nature of this film will turn many away, but if you've got the stomach for it, it's definitely worth a look.",1306713600,,1021,4.873563218390805

Watching this movie is not unlike watching Two Girls One Cup.  It's sick, it's twisted, and it's really hard to watch all the way through.  If you can do it without feeling like part of you died a little bit, then you deserve a cookie.

It does start to get a little silly toward the end, but it's worth a look, just for a reminder of how depraved human beings can be.

IMPRINT takes place in 19th century Japan. An American man ( Billy Drago) returns to Japan after a long absence to find Kamomo, the woman he loves. He left her behind years earlier, promising to return for her. His search takes him to an island ""where demons and whores rule the night"". There he meets a prostitute with a deformed face who tells the American a story full of cruelty and torment.
I think Takashi Miike is one of the best directors around, and IMPRINT just reinforces that opinion. This was, however, one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. The story touches on incest, abortion, abuse, and murder. There is a torture scene that is so excruciating to watch, even I flinched. IMPRINT contains images that are not for the squeamish. I'm a gorehound, and they freaked me out. IMPRINT's running time is only 65 minutes, but the DVD also contains over three hours of extras including the making of IMPRINT and an interview with Miike.

2613787,4,B000GI3RHY,"Japanese director Takashi Miike has always been a master of controversial cinema. His films such as ""Visitor Q"", ""Gozu"" and of course, the cult hit ""Audition"" have always pushed the boundaries of horror filmmaking. ""IMPRINT"" is Miike's contribution to the ""Masters of Horror"" series; co-produced by American filmmakers, the film nonetheless, carries the Takashi Miike seal of disturbing images, creepy cinematography and a certain seductive execution that you just cannot take your eyes off its proceedings. This is the film's uncut version that almost never made it to U.S. audiences.

In 19th century Japan, (when the West began to influence Japan), an American (Billy Drago) arrives in an isolated area in search of a Japanese prostitute that he had fallen in love with. He has traveled far in search of a woman named Komomo (Michie), traveling from brothel to brothel in hopes of liberating the kindly woman from her plight. Night falls, and he has no choice but to spend the night in this forsaken town and he is kept company by a kindly courtesan with a deformed face. This mysterious woman (Youki Kudoh) has tales of his beloved Komomo and as to how she had passed away. The man insists on knowing the truth; little does he know that some stories are better left untold.

IMPRINT is a very disturbing mindblower of a story based on the Japanese horror novel ""Bokee Kyotee"" by Shimako Iwai and adapted for the screen by Daisuke Tengan (Audition). The film is an unspeakabe orgy of torture and depravity, extreme cruelty and perverse vengeance, twisted secrets and stunning revelations. The film's story is told in flashbacks as told by the deformed courtesan played by Youki Kudoh (Memoirs of a Geisha, Mystery Train) and the actress does a very excellent job. In a role such as this, one must consider displaying a certain mental imbalance all the while acting as if there is nothing really amiss with the character. Kudoh is convincing and well carries the film's burden.

The past of the deformed courtesan is actually the film's showstopper. The audience will be drawn to the tales of this mysterious woman; layers upon layers of her character will be revealed slowly. The style of its storytelling is actually very effective. Her story as narrated gets more twisted and disturbing as the film progresses. To sum everything up; this is a tale of curses, Karma and betrayals. Komomo is a courtesan with a kind heart and the torture that she underwent exceeds that ones displayed in Miike's ""Audition"". I felt a certain uneasiness as I became privy to her torment but at the same time I could not look away. The violent images of abortion will also be etched in my memory.

The direction by Takashi Miike is as solid and competent as ever. I have often said that Miike is a master of visuals and movement; this film displays the usual style that American audiences have grown to love. The camera work is well-executed and the cinematography fits the film's premise. Miike utilizes a lot of colors that represent the film's mood; some scenes have more color than others and shadows are oftentimes utilized. The wind signifies the symbol of change in one's life. The film is VERY DISTURBING, and it is to Miike's credit that he manages to keep a balance between its disturbing images and the film's actual screenplay. I do think the director wanted to keep the cinematography enchanting and mysterious; while the images become more disturbing as it progresses, all the more becoming more seductive. Asian Horror thrives on slow reveal and foreshadowing and this film is no different.

The film's final act and the final SINISTER secret may not be wholly original, but Director Miike is smart enough to play on the film's strengths rather than some of it's weaknesses. One other flaw it may have is that Billy Drago's performance does seem a little lackluster. I felt that he was trying a little too hard to convince. His character may come across as a little underdeveloped for the inexperienced movie watcher but not so if you paid attention to the film's entirety. Aside from Kudoh's performance, Michie also shines in her role as Komomo, however limited her screen time might be. I felt nothing but sympathy for her torment.

The film is also nicely paced. For a film that clocks in at little over an hour, the film does manage to generate the right scares and mental disgust, but I was left hungering for more; all the more being relieved that the film's depressing story had ended. This is a film that really gets under your skin and emotions, and the less you know, the better the experience would be. Takashi Miike has never disappointed me with his tales of surprising twists and violent imagery and ""IMPRINT"" is no different. Japanese horror may sometimes have the usual motifs of Karma and cursed retribution but after viewing this film, these motifs become quite strong when handled by the right Japanese director such as Takashi Miike. This film is not for the squeamish and those who cannot stand disturbing images.
Cruel, full of torment and mind-blowing uneasiness, the film stays enchanting and gripping with its seductive execution.

2613788,1,B000GI3RHY,"I must first say that i saw clips of the Masters of horror series on the web from friends-and at that point i knew i had to get that show. So i got the first season (which is excellent). Great episodes all around, i was thrilled , each one better than the next. Then, yes then i came to ""Imprint"", now i hadn't seen any of Miike's other films I just had heard that they were shocking supposedly and somewhat gory. ""Sweet!"" was my reaction, i like things that are new and different, i figured i'd like this episode just the same as the others. I WAS DISAPPOINTED BEYOND BELIEF! it was terrible. Now, hear me out, cause in the beginning i was quite impressed with the cinematography and the story seemed intriguing enough. (all this time i'm waiting for the shocking stuff to happen) And then outta no where there comes this(in my opinion comical) ""torture scene"" with lots of random needles in weird places and it was pretty dumb the reason why the girl was tortured (they thought she stole a ring, so i guess that's punishable by fetish needle torture >.<) anywho, that scene had me doubting this episode. Then it just seemed to repeat itself between the disfigured whore and the american guy going ""your not telling me something"" and then ""ok here's my REAL story"" (insert 5-15min recap of life with more dumb twists). Anywho then the big hype that we're lead to is that really the freak disfigured prostitute is actually........you guessed it- a freak disfigured prostitute! (gee, didn't see that one coming >.>)
Only the thing that (i'm guessing) is supposed to freak me out is that she isn't just a disfigured prostitute, no no i might forgive it if that was the case, no no on her head is her ""sister"" in the form of the Hamburger helper hand. Well, without the glove anywho, but it's a hand from the south with buck teeth and all.
Now at this point i'm gone, laughing, rolling on the floor. I mean come on, a hand on her head that makes her do evil things? i'm not buying it.
Well, in the end the script goes from trying to just dumb and yeah. So if ya have to see this ""shocking"" episode and don't believe what i say, go ahead, just be sure to help yourself to more rice-a-roni, the san fransico treat :P",1219190400,2,2211,4.408312958435208
2613789,2,B000GI3RHY,"""Imprint"" is basically a cross between Miike's ""Box"" and Chan's ""Dumplings"", two short films from ""Three Extremes"" collection. Unfortunately, while both of those two shorts are great, ""Imprint"" is far from it. I wanted to like it, and up to a certain point I did. It's beautifully filmed, and is quite disturbing. I did look away from the screen a few times. Fact is, the story is simply too weak to make up for the beauty and the freakishness of it. Yes, the graphic violence is awful, but it's also strangely detached, making it impossible to feel the victim's pain. Besides, you could cut out all that violence and still loose nothing essential to the story. And I don't know about others, but I found Billy Drago's acting much more disturbing than the notorious torture scene. It's so bad that at times it's downright laughable. So is the ""twist"" when it comes. Two words: Hamburger Helper. I'll say no more - watch it and you'll know what I mean. It's funny, and not in a good way. Because it means to be serious, scary and haunting. Another problem with the film is that it's entirely in English. It's obvious that many of the actors can't speak English, and are simply reciting memorized lines. Which, of course, makes the dialogue wooden at best. The ending had me completely lost. The weak story, the uninspired acting, the long and purposeless torture scenes all turn ""Imprint"" into a rather tedious and unredeemable experience. It's obvious that, while having a great eye, and the courage to explore taboos, Miike seriously struggles with his ability (or lack thereof) to tell a decent tale. He doesn't build up tension, doesn't use subtlety to get under the viewer's skin - instead he uses gratuitous and twisted violence to get your attention. That's hardly a mark of a great director. If you're a Miike fan, then this is probably a must see for you. All others, only see this if you like long-winded stories with no real direction, terrible acting, and extremely brutal torture scenes.",1217030400,2,1999,4.763688760806916

More of this is needed in todays banal and nondescript rock and roll experience called....oh yeah, life.",1213401600,,439,5.197183098591549
2613791,3,B000GI3RHY,"The opening scene in IMPRINT really sets the mood for the whole film. A boat slowly traveling to a brothel off the coast of Japan comes upon a dead bloated body floating in the water. Strangely enough, this is one of the least sickest scenes in the film, which runs the gamut from torture, incest, domestic abuse, prostitution and murder. Miike was just being Miike on this one, it seems, and it's not hard to see why it was ""banned from cable"", as it's advertised on the DVD.

First, the good. The color scheme in this movie was interesting, especially the bright splashes of red. At one point in the film a young girl is led away from her house by a pimp whos dressed like Willy Wonka after one too many hits of acid. The actual plot of the story was very good, which differs considerable from some other MOH episodes that I know of. A lot of the little touches that Miike adds to his story (such as the character talking in the present while a past event is occuring behind him, in one scene in particular) are nicely done. And in general I think that Miike is a very good director; ""Koroshiya 1"" is one of my favorite films of all time.

The bad? Well, the glaringly obvious bad point in the film is the dialogue. The English language just doesn't sound right in the film. Also related to the dialogue was Billy Drago's performance, which was pretty bad. Finally, the ending involving the hand was absurd. But that's just my opinion.

Anyway, if you like Miike's other films like ""Gozu"" and ""Audition"", I'd definitely give this one a shot. It has it's flaws, but ultimately is pretty good.",1213228800,,1593,4.448630136986301

there really are no redeeming or happy qualities to this movie, its a descent to a place most people won't be able to stand to watch. a story ripe with torture(one of the most drawn out, cruel torture scenes ive seen), death, and lots of other dark elements, including primitive abortion proceedures and disposal of dead fetuses in the river(probably why it got banned from American cable)

The story drags for the first 2/3 and I almost turned it off. Another issue is the fact that you have to stay poised on the volume button. There are times when dialogue is almost impossible to hear and the next minute you hear crashes and booms that will explode your eardrums. Ultimately, this MOH goes nowhere and is poorly acted.

I thought it couldn't have been bad enough to get banned, but I could actually see why after viewing it.

It started off interesting and had a creepy vibe but it just got out of control after that.  Not to mention the always laughable Billy Drago was the main character.  This guys overacts more then anyone I have ever seen.  However he did provide me with a few laughs which always helps.

I would have to say that if you are all about gore then this would be perfect for you.  Personally I wasn't impressed.  It was way over the top and really had noting going in the scare department.",1191456000,3,839,4.213836477987422
2613798,2,B000GI3RHY,"""Imprint"" of the Masters of Horror is probably my least favorite of the Masters of Horror series. I'll grant, it has an interesting ""twist ending"" and I do enjoy Billy Drago's excellent performance, but this episode was ALL about making the audience as uncomfortable as possible. Throughout the film, we see aborted fetuses floating through a river, women getting beaten, a scene of implied rape of a child by her father, and a brutally LONG and graphic scene of torture to a completely innocent character. This film, directed by Takashi Miike, who loves to disgust his audience, is a grotesque, vile piece of cinema.

Even though you know it's all fake, it's still a very unpleasant ordeal. Now, I know some will step up and say that ""the graphic daring films like this are what make horror films of today great"", but frankly I disagree with that. Because this film, and most of Miike's films apply the most basic tactic to achieve fear: pain. The most graphic depictions of unbearable torture, mixed with the subcious empathy of the audience is an easy way to achieve horror from the viewer. I never felt any real fear from this episode, just cringed at the thought of how much pain the woman being tortured was going through. And that is basic, simplistic, easy to achieve.

The only person I could imagine enjoying this episode is a sado masochist.

I give this episodea second star ONLY because of Billy Drago's performance",1188691200,9,1428,4.77327935222672

Searching for his lost love, an American (Billy Drago) travels to a sinister island, where a disfigured prostitute (Youki Kudoh) tells her terrible fate before revealing her own disturbing secret.  Miike's first mistake is to shoot this in English.  Many of the performers stumble over their lines.  Drago overacts dreadfully, and the story seems to be little more than an excuse to string together graphic scenes of torture and abortion.  The prostitute's secret turns out to be quite ridiculous.  If you enjoy watching films that aim to shock, you will find much to enjoy here, but you'll be disappointed if you're hoping for a coherent narrative.",1183507200,3,767,5.145161290322581
2613800,2,B000GI3RHY,"This is a particularly bad entry in Takashi Miike's world.  This film would have been much better had it been shot in Japanese.  The Japanese actors struggle with English, and Billy Drago is absolutely horrible in the lead.  He has screen presence, but he would have better if he had been dubbed in Japanese.  His English dialogue is awful, and he's so wretchedly over the top he's unintentionally funny.  Why this was banned (or, more correctly, not broadcast) is questionable.  Sure, it's disturbing, but Miike has made more disturbing work.  As another reviewer pointed out, it may have to do with the fact that it's just a bad film.  There are some good, creepy moments here, but the English dialogue is so appalling bad that it's almost impossible to sit through the whole thing.  And why did the producers insist on Miike shooting this in English?  Any viewer of this series will know Miike, and would accept him shooting in his native language.  The torture scene doesn't seem to have much of a point other than showing someone getting tortured.  Miike usually doesn't do this.  Even the torture scenes in Ichi the Killer moved the movie along.

4. The ending!!! AHAHAHA! man, nevermind. buy this just so you can see how terrible it is.

I am a fan of Takashi Miike, but I seriously couldn't believe how much I disliked this film. I didn't want to finish it, which is something that doesn't happen to me that often.

You know what, I'm going to spoil this film so you don't waste your money on it:

A man goes to some brothel kind of thing.

He meets a girl with a scar on her face.

I guess hes looking for this girl he was in love with that worked there.

She tells him the story of what happened to her.

You get to watch her get tortured because the head brothel lady thinks she stole something from her, but she was framed.

You watch her get needles shoved into her and under her fingernails. She also gets burned by some sticks and pees on herself.

You get to see the girls childhood where she was poor and her mom was an abortionist for some poor village.

You get to see some bloody baby corpses, which are like almost full grown, i guess thats how they do it.

and then something dumb happens, like a twist or something. and i think at the end it turns out that the girl has like another head or something equally as funny.

2613802,4,B000GI3RHY,"Showtime's Masters of Horror series has had it's share of up's and down's with little middle ground in between, but Imprint shines as undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the entire series.  Originally banned from broadcasting on Showtime, Imprint is from Takashi Miike, the man who brought us Audition, and he doesn't disappoint in the shock department.  Billy Drago plays an American searching for an Asian prostitute he fell in love with years before.  His search brings him to a mysterious place where a disfigured woman tells him the chilling and horiffic tale of her fate.  Considering some of the content we've seen on episodes previous to Miike's (in terms of gore) the banning of Imprint doesn't make entirely too much sense.  The story and imagry however, including a stream of aborted baby fetuses, could be reason enough alone.  However, Miike's uncpmpromising vision is what makes Imprint so good in the first place.  He's always been a director who has never been afraid to take risks, and he knows how to get under your skin.  Imprint does just that, and it is undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever produced for Masters of Horror.  The only downsides of Imprint is Billy Drago's overacting, and the grisly content is definitely not for everyone, but in this age of Eli Roth's Hostel films and torture horror being all the rage, Imprint shines above them all.",1181347200,5,1380,4.863247863247863

2613806,3,B000GI3RHY,"Masters of Horror: Imprint (Takashi Miike, 2005)

After seeing Dario Argento's amazing, disgusting Jenifer, I wondered what Takashi Miike could have possibly done to make his Masters of Horror entry, Imprint, so disgusting that Showtime wouldn't even air it. (As I understand it--I don't get showtime, which is why I'm renting these piecemeal as I can find them--they did eventually show it, though in a heavily-edited form.) Well, now I've seen it, and my question hasn't been answered; if anything I'm even more confused.

Imprint will be most familiar to Miike fans who've seen Sabu; it's another made-for-TV costume drama, though time constraints stopped Miike from really pulling out all the stops here like he did for Sabu. Instead, he gets story-heavy, using the atmosphere more as a prop than as a character in itself. If you're gonna do that, you've gotta have one helluva story. And he does. Christopher (Billy Drago) is an American who fell in love with Komomo, a Japanese whore (Michie Ito), and has returned to take her back to America, marry her, and, in his words, ""give her the life she deserves."" She is no longer where he found her, and so goes on a long, long trek through Japan to find her. As the scene opens, he's on a boat to a mysterious island, ""populated,"" we are told, ""only by demons and whores."" (Whether the demons are of the literal or metaphoric variety is left to the viewer to decide, however.) When he gets there, he's told by the disfigured, rather slimy pimp (Audition's Toshie Negishi) that Komomo was never there, but offers to put him up for the night anyway, pairing him with a nameless woman (Memoirs of a Geisha's Youki Kudoh), who has a deformed face--and a surprising tale to tell that changes, bobs, and weaves as Christopher tries to get closer to the true fate of his beloved. (Those who've seen Miike's infamous Ichi the Killer will recognize the woman's facial deformity with some mirth, I'd warrant.) When he does finally uncover the truth, it's certainly not what he was expecting.

As an allegory for various of the seven deadly sins, it's hard to paint Imprint as anything but a success. Problem is, that sort of thinking will only come a while after you've seen the film. At is more basic visceral level--that of being a short horror story--it doesn't work nearly as well, which is (to me) very surprising for a director of Miike's caliber. I've no idea whether it has anything to do with this being Miike's first film directed completely in the English language (which Miike doesn't seem to speak terribly well), but I get the feeling that that had more than a little to do with Billy Drago's almost ludicrous overacting; a lot of the drawn-out howling inflection does have a tinge of the Japanese about it. Also, while the effects budget is nowhere near what Miike enjoyed while making, say, Sabu or Gozu, Argento had a similarlty basement budget, but used it to stunning effect, even when the effects were cheesy. I'm not sure whether it's the main effect itself or the silliness of the conception behind it, but at no time is the main villain anything other than outright funny. (To be fair, the rest of the effects--the body in the water in the opening scene, for example--are very well-done.)

I'm certainly not going to call Imprint a bad film, because really, anything that's been touched by the hand of Takashi Miike is bound to be better than ninety percent of the cinematic dross to which you're exposed in any given year. But in the greater body of Miike's work, Imprint will most likely be remembered as a minor footnote at best. ***",1180137600,,3601,4.729299363057325
2613807,2,B000GI3RHY,"The plot, or at least as much of it as can be determined, is fairly straightforward. An American (Billy Drago) travels to a brothel on an island of demons and prostitutes in search of a woman (Michie Ito) he promised years before to take to America with him. There, he meets a young prostitute (Youki Kudoh) with a facial deformity, and she tells him that the woman he seeks is no longer alive, having hanged herself some time previously. This news drives Drago into a rage, and he begs the woman for the full story. What follows is a series of stories that serve primarily as a pretext for torture, incest, misogynistic abuse, and graphic abortions.

There are, at least to me, several problems with this film. First, the acting is awful. Drago in particular is histrionic, and his character therefore never becomes real. Instead, I saw a man acting as someone in emotional agony. I got the idea, but I never felt any truth behind it. Next, the violence. Director Miike can be expected to deliver graphic scenes, and he does not fail here, but the graphic scenes are all of violence against women. It may be unfair to accuse Miike of misogyny, especially in light of the direction&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Audition/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Audition</a>&nbsp;takes, but had Imprint been my sole exposure to him, I'd have been hard to convince otherwise. Though only an hour long, Imprint features such unrelenting violence against women that it seems to last much longer.

My next complaint is the torture. The level here is not as bad as in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guinea-Pig/dp/B000679MJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guinea Pig</a>&nbsp;films (and at least has some context to support it, unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devil-s-Experiment/dp/B00006959P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devil's Experiment</a>, one of the Guinea Pig films), but the context seems a pretext. Simply put, torture for the sake of torture doesn't make an enjoyable film for me.

Finally, the plot itself is inconsistent. As another reviewer sagely noted, after a few minutes, the film settles into a two-character study, but this study proves problematic. There are echoes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon/dp/B00003CXC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon</a>&nbsp;here as the woman's story changes with each retelling, but the progression of stories lacks the purpose present in the Kurosawa classic. Instead, we just get variations on themes, leading to an absurd twist in the last ten minutes that makes the film into a farce. I found myself laughing at the film, a sure sign that the movie had failed in whatever goals Miike had.

Ultimately, I found this film lacking almost everything that I look for in a good horror film. There was no suspense, and there were no genuine scares. Yes, there are elements of horror--violence, demons, a supernatural theme--, but, like the film itself, the elements never ossify into the real deal. And so there you have it. This film didn't work for me. It did for others, though, so if you're reading this wondering whether you should buy Imprint, compare the reviews and see whose tastes better suit you.

Everything that makes a movie not succeed seems to occur.  The acting is unemotional and the lead male actor is atrocious.  The story line, while bizarre, begins to unfold in a manner to suggest that the director didn't really know what to make a movie about.  First it's a story about one thing, and then it seems to jump gears and take a different approach altogether, without a whole lot of transition.  Maybe it's just me.  I must admit that the torture scene was one of the most convincing scenes i have ever sat through, and like a previous reviewer, had trouble watching it at times.  I almost feel that the movie should have ended shortly after the torture scene, that was the true climax of the movie and really the only part that seemed capable of evoking any sort of response out of the viewer.  My suggestion is to watch the film up to the torture scene and then flip it off, the rest of the film is a steady implosion and ruins most of the potential it could have carried.",1174435200,,1111,4.411764705882353

2613811,1,B000GI3RHY,"(Note: I tried to minimize spoilers in my review.) I am a very big Miike and J-horror fan in general, but this was one of the worst movies I have seen (I actually would have rather watched Cabin Boy, which was my previous ""worst movie I have ever seen.""). The story started out interesting, but there were major issues: It makes sense that Japanese coirtesans catering to international clientele speak English, but they should speak it with heavy Japanese accents. The female lead had an American accent with *slight* hints of a Japanese accent. Very annoying. Also, if Billy Drago's character travels all over Japan, he should speak some of it, but that might just be American arrogance. The torture sequence was one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen. It was also the best, most realistic scene in the film, and the woman being tortured was startlingly authentic in her reactions. Her screams brought me to tears and I covered my eyes. But I don't so much of that had to be shown. Horror works when one imagines what is happening rather than having it shoved in one's face. This is akin to the ""show, don't tell"" rule in writing. What one doesn't see and can only imagine is scarier. Also, the ending scene left me thinking about ""Hamburger Helper."" It was ridiculous and insulting that Miike thought anyone would buy that! The only things of real interest were the various stories the lead female character told about her life, true or not. And Billy Drago's performance was so over-the-top as to be hilarious, but it was not good acting. I was disappointed by this movie I expected to love! The best part of the movie was that it was only an hour long!",1171584000,,1668,4.619528619528619
2613812,5,B000GI3RHY,"----- Right off the bat.  This movie will blow you away.  In fact, I'm still picking pieces of my skull out of the carpet.  This film pretty much has it all.  The settings are gorgeous, the scares (involving spirits)are subtle, and the shock is in your face.  One of the best torture scenes I've seen since.....basically ever (Needles were kind of scary to begin with, but now they're just downright frightening, and you can just forget about sewing or going to the doctor).  Anyways it also has; aborted fetuses floating down the river, prostitution & incest, a quirky creature, a mangled face, a terrible american actor, and a syphlitic midget with a chicken on his head.  Now if this doesn't sound like the 12 days of black christmas to you, then maybe you should stick to bland hollywood horror.  Because this baby wasn't banned from cable television for nothing.

----- Because of this movie Takashi Miike is now a staple in my horror library. Nothing (in my opinion) he has ever done even comes close to this.  Suffice it to say, I really don't feel anything he has directed before this actually qualifies as ""real"" horror (Except maybe ""The Box"" on 3 Extremes).  ""Audition"" comes close, but ends up being a love story gone terribly arye. ""Ichi"" is definitely an action movie, a bloody action movie, but an action movie none the less.  Visitor Q is an exploitation flick/satire with an actual message; although god only knows what that message is.  I really shouldn't be so pretentious though, because I still haven't seen ""Gozu"" or ""One Missed Call"".  But from what I have seen, this is the only film of his that is genuinely horror.

  This movie is a ""must-have"" for anyone into gore or anyone who is tired of the same old Japanese ghost flick.  This is Asia at its cinematic best.  And with this, Miike has shown american horror directors what a master really is.

MORAL OF THE STORY:  Don't fall in love with prostitutes, because you'll only wind up eating aborted fetuses.",1169596800,7,1984,4.6927536231884055
2613813,5,B000GI3RHY,"Masters of Horror is a strange series.  A third of the directors chosen for the first season were not really masters of anything except maybe mediocrity; another third were directors who made perhaps one acknowledged horror classic but have otherwise spotty track records; the last third were people deservedly legendary for a run of greatness but, truthfully, whose best work is found generally long ago (as in, back in the seventies!).  It may not be surprising then that the one episode that wound up not even being shown was by the one director who's been making his best work in the recent past, who doesn't even work in English, and whose work has barely seen any theatrical distribution in this country.  Not to try to equate obscurity with quality, but part of Miike's success unquestionably comes from his working under the radar: he does what he wants without much interference or commercial pressure and the results are often very wonderfully idiosyncratic and strange in ways most filmmakers simply can't get away with.

If you are just looking for tons of bloody gore or cat-flying-off-the-shelf-makes-hot-teen-girl-scream jumps, probably not for you; this is a movie about guilt and the terrible things people do to each other, not a scare machine.  If you just can't deal with extended sequences of bodily harm and torment, you should probably skip this.  If you don't know Miike's work at all and are somewhat curious to try one, the best entry point might actually be the somewhat atypical slow building Audition (but watch it subtitled) rather than Imprint.  If you have seen and not responded well to any of Miike's other work because it does not have a Hollywood veneer or mentality, you are not likely to find Imprint to your taste.  Those who are fond of Miike's Japanese work but worried about how he would handle an English language TV episode made for broadcast on Showtime (which was my frame of mind): don't worry.  Unlike many of the other ""Masters,"" Miike did not have to go to Vancouver and was able to work in Japan with his regular crew, so the quality of the work is very comparable to his other films.  The stilted English delivered phonetically and the peculiar acting of Billy Drago actually are rather in sync with Miike's surreal and somewhat Brechtian style and don't seem to me to be real minuses.  The length is exactly right for this story and the narrative packs a real emotional punch in my view; I was pretty impressed.  Another plus is the substantial extras included here: a very in depth and pretty interesting interview with Miike and a making-of featurette that is well put together and informative, unlike most.  Overall, a worthy addition to Miike's growing body of challenging films.",1169337600,4,2736,4.870689655172414
2613814,3,B000GI3RHY,"I found it odd that the supposed reason for being banned from Showtime (showing aborted fetuses) was much less unnerving than the scenes of torture that the main character endures. That said, the rest of the film was satisfying with the atmosphere it created. However, the narrative was often disjunctive. While it may have been intentional, it felt more like the film had been cut to fit the 60 minute format of the Masters Of Horror series that it was part of. While it was interesting to watch, I didn't feel like I had watched anything of the calibre that I had expected given Miike's reputation. This being the first Miike film that I had seen, I decided I should see more of his work before passing judgment. So, I watched ""Audition"", one of two films of Miike that have garnered the most praise. While I liked it more than ""Imprint"", I still didn't see any evidence of what has garnered Miike's adulation. Every review that I had read said that if you could stomach the last half-hour of the film, you'd see brilliant filmmaking.

2613816,5,B000GI3RHY,"IMPRINT. BANNED FROM SHOWTIME. Takashi Miike, the director of movies such as Audition, Ichi the Killer, and Visitor Q. And then he made Imprint.

Imprint was 1st scheduled to air on Showtimes Masters of Horror series, but was banned because it was too graphic, too much for these weak American movie critics (I am American too). I mean, these are just movies. MOVIES not the news. And yes they can be pretty bad, and I understand why the don't show stuff on basic cable, but this is a premium cable channel, Showtime. I mean, why would they get a director like Takashi Miike in the 1st place? Had then not seen anything by him or even heard anything about him? This men has a infamous reputation here. So they made us wait months and months until its DVD release, and I could not wait for it to come out. I am a big fan off Miike, and definately wanted to see what all the hype was about.

And let me tell you.... It lived up to it.

The story is about a man who has returned to Japan to search for a prostitute he promised years ago, to take her to America to give her the life she deserves. He then meets another geisha who starts to tell him about her and her whereabouts. Without revealing too much (since its only an hour long) at the midway point is when it all goes down. One of the best torture scenes I have ever seen. One that gets under your skin. Sure, there are plenty of movies that have people get chopped in half, or guts all over the place, but it is how this one is down that makes it so powerful. That makes Imprint so great. After that, it then continues to be a jaw dropper in similar fashion to another infamous Asian ""short but has a full-length version"" (which is possibly the main reason not shown on TV) with a what just happened ending.

Takashi Miike is truly a Master of Horror and making people squirm. I watched it by myself the night it came out and I was stunned and amazed. I then took it over to a friends house to watch it with 4 other guys. 2 of them had to leave the room during that part while the other 2 sat there in awe of what was happening. And to me, that makes it so much better. Seeing how other people react to it means that it is for a true horror fan that is ready for the worst of them. I love a good horror movie, and ever since I first saw an Asian movie (Audition) I have been hooked. They are so much more clever, so powerful, unpredictable, and can get under your skin like no one else. And for all these reasons, in my opinion Imprint is the best horror movie for testing someone as too how much they can handle horror. If only for all the hype, being banned, and the reactions to those who have seen it, or will not dare watch it. Atleast, for any movie I have ever seen until another comes along.

The only knock I have on Imprint is that it is only an hour. I mean, its not a huge downer because it doesn't really slow down,and you don't feel cheated that you didn't get everything, it just would have been nice to see a few more parts that make Imprint, IMPRINT. And it is in English, unlike Miike's other movies, so it doesn't have the true feel of an Asian movie, yet they are all Asian except for one.

Overall it is a great short movie and a MUST SEE for anyone who is a true horror fan. But what do I know? I'm just a regular movie addict like yourself.

The opening scenes made it looked like this was actually gonna be an interesting, perhaps scary, movie.

An American journalist returns to Japan to reunite with his long lost Japanese lover.  However, he cannot locate her and searches for her everywhere in Japan.  Finally, he comes onto an island that seems to be littered with prostitues.  It is rumored that demons dwell there as well.

Immediately, the journalist inquires a little person has heard of or seen Komomo, his lover.  When he gets a negative reply, he turns around to leave.  However, he's immediately convinced to stay for the night.

Once, he settles into a room, a disfigured prostitute enters.  She tries to get things started for a night of action but the journalist is not in the mood.  Instead, he asks to tell him a story.

The stories are the main focus of the film.  The stories are gruesome and graphic, which is definitely worse than any episode of CSI.  These scenes will make you look away from the screen.  For me, it was like I couldn't watch.  Yet, I couldn't look away either.  I was peeking through my fingers.  Definitely not for the squeamish!

The plot builds up, which is excellent and intriguing...until the end.  When the prostitute reveals something about herself, the movie just skydives.  For me, I couldn't help but laugh.  It was somewhat cheesy but it was bizarre as well.

Wisely, the movie ended at the right time.  If it had been longer, it would have been downright silly and cheesy.  However, it ended where you could still dwell on the gory parts.

I mentioned earlier that this movie isn't for the squeamish.  There's a good number of torture, physical violence, dead bodies, incest and more.  I could see where people might get offensive...especially involving the dead bodies.  If you're easily offended, then don't watch this film.",1166659200,8,2062,4.689075630252101

""Masters Of Horror"" has been quite a pleasure to watch since it's inception in 2005. This much-rumored-about episode of the series became notorious in the horror world as the first installment to be denied an airing due to Showtime's rules. Although,""Masters Of Horror"" was fully funded even before Showtime came along, according to the series creator Mick Garris, the directors involved were given totally free reign as to what stories they told and how they wanted to tell them. But when Showtime came on board, they, of course laid out a handful of rules. One was, there could be no full frontal male nudity. Another was, there could be no violence committed on a child by another child (but violence on adults by children or children on adults was fine). Yeah, OK then... Originally the episodes were just going to be released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

The story follows an American(Billy Drago)ex-G.I. on a journey to a creepy island bordello in Japan. He is frantically searching for a girl he made a promise to during wartime but lost touch with many years before. The deformed prostitute he meets on the island has many stories to tell regarding his girl and they abound in incest, abortion, murder, and one of the most horrendous torture scenes (with the real life writer of the short story in the grisly role of the middle-aged whore-bully) ever produced. A solid 5 out of 5 stars! Too bad more people didn't get to see this GEM! I just can't help wondering if my beloved HBO would have aired it???

Everything in this banned episode of Masters Of Horror takes disturbance and imagery to a different level.

This aside, Imprint is a worthy addition to the horror genre and a good introduction to Miike's work for western audiences whom are unfamiliar with the extremists previous outings. Be warned though, this is horror undiluted, sadistic and different to most cinemaplex style offerings and is precisely why his work has attracted attention from people as famous as director Eli Roth (whom gave Miike a cameo in his film Hostel).

2613825,3,B000GI3RHY,"Takashi Miike knows the outer limits of American cable. ""Imprint,"" the notorious Japanese director's entry in Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" series, proved too extreme for the network. ""Banned from cable TV"" the DVD slipcase shouts. Not even a close call, most rational viewers will agree.

""Imprint"" loiters in the darkest places of civilized life, exploiting incest, abortion, spousal abuse, child molestation, torture and more. ""What system, what producer would greenlight this?"" Miike muses in the extras. ""For me this is like a car accident.""

A better question: Why bother to watch such a thing? Miike is hugely talented, as he proved with the domestic shocker ""Audition."" The hourlong ""Imprint's"" dark beauty can't be denied. Visually, it's reminiscent of Kurosawa's final poetic works. The plot goes from strange to absurd in the final 15 minutes, but the story still fascinates with its twists and ""Rashomon""-like shuffling of realities. For those who can bear it, ""Imprint"" proves a singular experience.

The story is set on a Japanese island, near the end of the 19th century. The American anti-hero, played by Billy Drago, shows up at a low-rent brothel seeking a working girl he promised to marry years ago. A hooker, beautiful despite a deformed face, gives him tea and comfort, then launches into a long story about her past and his lost love. ""I am surrounded by madness,"" the seeker proclaims once he has heard enough. But the madness has just begun.

Miike is interviewed at length in the extras. He seems like a decent guy, well versed in fast-and-furious filmmaking. A text essay on the director and his many genre films will be helpful for most viewers. The commentators, oddly enough, are not big fans of the work. Chris D. of the American Cinematheque and writer Wyatt Doyle call Miike's decision to shoot in English a cop-out. They expect more from Miike. Good talk. The DVD includes a pair of decent making-of docus that add up to about 70 minutes. The letterboxed images (1.77:1, enhanced) are flawless and richly colored.

2613827,5,B000GI3RHY,"Takashi Miike's entry into Showtime's ""Masters Of Horror"" series, in which a bunch of spooky directors get their shot to make a one-hour, no-holds-barred film, became somewhat notorious after the pay cable net decided against broadcasting it.  In a series where gory violence was the norm, how bad could this one be?  Of course, anyone who's seen Miike films such as ""Audition"" or ""Visitor Q"" could tell you that he can make Rob Zombie's hardcore-horrific ""The Devil's Rejects"" look like Disney.  Still, here Miike would be constrained a bit by the format and even the language (this is his first picture in English), so it couldn't be that far beyond the pale, could it?  Well, my fellow perverts, while ""Imprint"" does not mark a new extreme in the extremes of extremity, it's definitely one of the most grotesque of the ""Masters"" series.  It's also one of the best.

An American (Billy Drago, doing a David Carradine impression) travels to a small Japanese island that serves as a brothel/village to find the beautiful young prostitute he fell in love with and vows to rescue.  Unable to find her, he instead spends the night in conversation with another prostitute with a facial deformity.  She tells him about her life, and weirdness ensues.  What probably got this episode pulled might have been the extended, unrelenting torture scene, but it was probably the subplot involving an abortionist, with graphic shots of dead fetuses left to drift away in a stream.  In any case, it's more than even a few supposedly sick gore-hounds will be comfortable with (of course, I remember reading that ""Reservoir Dogs"" caused more than a few walk-outs when it was shown at a horror film festival).  Anyway, by the end, the naturalism of the novel this was based on has been replaced by dark supernatural elements and even some out-and-out surrealism.  Actually, many will want to criticize this not for all that, but for what appears to be Drago's blatant overacting.  In my opinion, though, even that fit in with the general tone that Miike sets.

The disc also includes some long featurettes, which give plenty of information about the method to Miike's madness.  While ""Imprint"" is kind of like the director is working with one hand painfully binded behind his back and then hacked off (for a more ""pure"" experience, see ""Ichi the Killer""), this is still way more stylish than most of the other MOH episodes, with the possible exception of Lucky McKee's entry, ""Sick Girl.""

I've seen him before in various (awful) movies, but this has to take the cake! He's so over the top he fell off Everest. Really bad. You'll see.

Drago aside, I have to admit I was hoping for a bit more fright. The torture scenes are graphic and disturbing, and the content is crude and beyond the barriers of human decency (which is ok with me), but it was no 'Audition'... The plot is convoluted, ragged and almost non-existent - a mish-mash of images and atmosphere.

 The creepiness factor stars right away, but the movie drags a bit too long in getting to any real scares, and even then I wasn't too shocked to turn away from the screen- (who are these people who can't even watch?!)  I think it will take a few viewings to make sense of it.

 I bought this sight-unseen due to the reputation of the director, but you may want to try renting it from Netflix or borrowing a friend's before making the move to purchase.  Maybe I'm missing something...",1161907200,5,1320,4.381147540983607
2613830,5,B000GI3RHY,"Imprint is an exquisite synthesis of beauty and horror. It will long imprint itself upon the viscera, eye, and psyche of the viewer. Disturbingly dark and rich atmospheric elements compel the viewer into a world in which few have or would ever wish to visit. It is no wonder that this was banned from U.S. cable. It touches upon and dances freely with virtually every taboo. Watching this film is like being mesmerized with an intricately decorated, velvet-covered sledge hammer. Don't plan on eating popcorn with this one.

Takashi Miike is truly a Master of Horror.",1161820800,,567,4.90625
2613831,5,B000GI3RHY,"A friend on mine recomended Ichii the Killer to me and I thought this was one of the most twisted movies that I had seen in a while .Followed that up with watching Audition and Visitor Q .Imprint is a blend of the last two I mentioned plus a little Evil Dead Trap for good measure. Audition for it's brutality and cruelty , Visitor Q for how bizare things are in his world ,and EDT for the weird ending .I was disappointed in Showtime for not airing this episode of ""The Masters of Horror"".The premise of the series was to let these directors run wild with what they wanted to do .Still they editted and omitted 2 of my favorite directors ,Argento and Miike .I was glad to see that this didn't get buried in the vault to rot .Not for the faint of heart ,for fans of Japanese Horror.",1161561600,,782,4.22
