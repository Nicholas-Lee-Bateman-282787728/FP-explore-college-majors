8577496,5,B00C5U2A9C,Did year 1 with this program last year. Ive tried many different Latin programs and this one by far is the best weve tried!! We actually finished the entire 1st year program and my children learned so much!!!,1527552000,,208,4.5
8577497,5,B00C5U2A9C,Bought this to help us through the Henle Latin books~ Dwane is a genius and makes latin fun.,1509494400,,92,4.166666666666667
8577498,5,B00C5U2A9C,"This is year two with this curriculum.  Year one was with a tutor at a homeschool coop - very little involvement on my part.  Now I can watch the videos, and review the worksheets and quizzes.  Even with no prior Latin, the curriculum really is uber-easy to manage.  The response to questions on the Facebook page is almost immediate :)  One of the benefits of having the Teachers Guide is there is more that can be done - audio Latin resources, additional videos as well as Latin books are recommended to truly provide the High School credit.  Carole Joy Seid recommended this curriculum and I must say that my student (12 grader) and I are very happy!",1503878400,,653,4.538461538461538
8577499,5,B00C5U2A9C,"Great Course... I was AMAZED at the amount of information is in this complete course... WOW! What a GREAT deal for the money.  And Dwane Thomas is a great teacher with his quirky humor, it makes learning Latin enjoyable even for a late 40's guy like myself. I'm sure if you're looking for a course for your children, this is a great one for them!",1455148800,2,346,4.323076923076923
8577500,3,B00C5U2A9C,"Dwane Thomas seems to really know his Latin. He also seems to be a decent teacher. However the worksheets/tests and answer key have quite a few errors in them. Too many times we translate on the worksheet only to go to the answer key and find that the wording is different. How do we know if we did it correctly when the answer key has different words in the sentence? We are working on the second half of the program and when I went to print my worksheets/test and answer keys they were unavailable for about three weeks due to ""editing"". We were hopeful that the errors were being corrected. Sadly, there are still quite a few.",1410307200,5,629,4.384615384615385
