3686017,4,B001LM64CY,A delightful video for children (and adults) of all ages.  Artfully done and easily explainable to all.  I highly recommend this video for introducing children to Biblical stories and for refreshing memories of those who already know the story.,1307232000,2,244,5.230769230769231
3686018,3,B001LM64CY,"I didn't like the graphic aspect of killing in the sons of noah, which is the second part of this video. The story of the flood was not as indepth as i expected it to be either.",1270166400,5,177,3.810810810810811
3686019,5,B001LM64CY,"l was very impressed with all (UNDER THE RAINBOW PRODUCTS) 12in all. And the children just watch them over and over again. Not to mention myself! Two thumbs up!

3686036,5,B001LM64CY,"This was a great learning tool for my children bible class.  It illustrates the lesson by far better than some of the other DVD's I have purchased.  I ordered 4other DVD's at the same time, and they all were wonderful.",1413417600,,218,4.425
3686037,3,B001LM64CY,It's ok. I find that it's not very factual. It amazes me how some people think that children are stupid. They're not!,1411430400,,117,4.363636363636363
3686038,5,B001LM64CY,"It helped my Sunday school class. After we went over the story, the movie made it a better understanding for them",1405468800,,113,4.428571428571429
3686039,5,B001LM64CY,My 6 year old granddaughter loves the story of Noah's Ark. She loves to watch this movie and tells me what is going to happen next. Great buy.,1400025600,,142,4.107142857142857
3686040,2,B001LM64CY,"My 2 1/2 yr old grandson was attentive to the dvd, but we ultimately turned it off because the story does not stick
to scripture.  It's like a Hollywood-ized version of most Bible stories or characters, in an animated version.",1393891200,2,226,4.65
3686051,1,B001LM64CY,"So glad I previewed this before letting grand daughter watch. It is poorly animated, takes too long to get to the Noah part, several scary scenes for little ones. We'll stick to Veggie Tales, story books and songs.",1391731200,,214,4.657894736842105
3686052,5,B001LM64CY,great movie for the kids to learn the bible. My four year old grandson loved the movie and had lots to say after the movie was over.,1390780800,,132,3.925925925925926
3686053,5,B001LM64CY,I got this as Christmas gift for 3 years old son. we didn't open it yet. I bet he will love this!,1387756800,,97,3.4545454545454546
3686054,5,B001LM64CY,"The first story i bought from the ""Under Gods Rainbow series was THE PROPHETS. My children (8,6, and 3) loved it. they watched it so much they could even recite every word said. It has helped me teach the children about out faith in a way that i could never have done myself. I even watch it sometimes and it helps me with the specifics of names and places and times in the Bible. its a must have for very home. We all love this DVD and I have currently placed an order for 5more",1387411200,,479,4.052631578947368
3686055,5,B001LM64CY,I loved this cartoon especially watching it as an adult. I like the fact that even a child can understand the meaning. The concept is simple but entertaining!,1384992000,,158,4.678571428571429
3686056,5,B001LM64CY,It's wonderful story for children that adults can enjoy with their children. I wish it was a little longer.  Fantastic.,1383264000,,119,4.95
3686057,3,B001LM64CY,"The animation is far less detailed than we had hoped. We are still looking for a product that will keep our thee-year-old as engaged as ""Lion King"".",1372032000,,148,4.518518518518518
3686058,5,B001LM64CY,This was a big hit. I bought it for my 4 year old son but it captivated my 7 year old daughter and myself more :),1363132800,,113,3.3846153846153846
3686059,5,B001LM64CY,I absolutly love these movies. They help me to introduce many of the bible stories to my daughter. She really enjoys them!,1333843200,2,122,4.590909090909091
3686060,5,B001LM64CY,"We bought a bunch of these animated movies to reinforce what we learn in our non-denominational church. The kids relate what they see in the movies to what they learn in Sunday school, and it helps them to bring the stories together in their mind. We plan on adding to our collection again this Christmas.",1317427200,,305,4.5636363636363635
8318564,5,B001LM64CY,Vendor provided very fast shipping. DVD was in excellent condition. Great DVD for my Sunday School class of K-3 students.,1496534400,,121,5.1
8318565,5,B001LM64CY,Good Stories for teaching kids. My kids love these movies and they learn from the stories. Helps them to visualize the Bible. I highly recommend this series is the most accurate I have found and is neutral on Christian religions.,1483747200,,229,4.75
8318566,1,B001LM64CY,Did not like it would not recommend buying it,1456617600,,45,4.111111111111111

8318568,5,B001LM64CY,Kids love it and I do too,1445040000,,25,2.7142857142857144
8318569,5,B001LM64CY,"I bought the entire collection of both the Old Testament Bible Stories for Children, and the New Testament series as well. Although the Japanese-based animation is the same in both series, the flow of the storytelling and the music soundtrack is much better in the Old Testament series (although I must admit that on some of the DVDs, the story could have been shortened by 5 minutes or so). Both series are geared towards children, and it is the reason why the violence and attempted rape scenes were removed but still referred to, so that the view understands the context of the story. This is a great series for children to watch and learn about the Old Testament. It is a useful teaching tool for parents, especially if each DVD is purchased for $5 or less.",1437264000,,761,4.602941176470588
8318570,5,B001LM64CY,great for my children to learn stories in the bible,1431561600,,51,4.2
8318571,5,B001LM64CY,Again perfect story of Noah and every child should learn about Noah and the Arc,1429920000,,79,4.333333333333333
8318572,1,B001LM64CY,I was disappointed. It is so far off from the biblical account I tried to fast forward to the part where the animals came aboard. I don't care how entertaining a cartoon might be; you do NOT want to use this as a teaching tool.  The idea is to teach the truth. Once a young child's mind absorbs the inconsistencies presented in this video it will be difficult for them to forget and learn the true story.,1427587200,,404,4.246753246753247
8318573,2,B001LM64CY,"Nice idea, but just not done very well.  It's not this particular story, I bought 4 DVDs produced by the same company - they were all lacking.  Can't put my finger on any one issue, but it doesn't keep my attention and, more importantly, it had the same affect on my grandchildren.",1427068800,,281,4.384615384615385
