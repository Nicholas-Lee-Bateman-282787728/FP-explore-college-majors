3929885,5,B000RJSINK,"I just finished watching and I'm smiling as typing this.  Enjoyable and endearing.  I felt happy, laughed, related, sad, I cried, felt discouraged, hopeful and then happy again, rollercoaster of emotions as I was pulled into the storyline...amazing how this movie touched on so much...ten thumbs up! woot woot! :)",1382832000,3,313,5.24

3929887,5,B000RJSINK,"I saw someone on youtube who rated this as their favorite Korean movie which intrigued me.  I typically don't pay much attention to things like this, but I'm SO glad I did this time!  This was truly one of the best Korean films I've ever seen.  Not to be a cliche, but I laughed, I cried and in the end I just felt great!  I really recommend!",1369785600,5,342,4.059701492537314

3929890,5,B000RJSINK,"Amazon Prime has got a pretty good selection of free Korean Movies, and I like Romantic Comedies in general, so from the snowy hills of Northern NY, I have been trying a few of these out. I really liked this one. A boy and a girl have been best friends since childhood. Everybody around them knows that they love each other and should be a couple - except them! What makes this a better movie than most, is that all the details are really original. Just as one example: She wants to be an actress but she is too shy to act! Lots of creativity and originality.",1364688000,13,559,4.233644859813084
3929891,4,B000RJSINK,"Ji-Hwan (Kwon Sang-Woo) was a bit of a loner as a kid until Dal-Rae (Kim Ha-Neul) befriended him and they've been close friends ever since.  The film opens at the point they are transitioning from adolescence to adulthood and working to realize their dreams.  Neither one has found their place in the world needed to develop one's confidence on a number of different levels (career, personal relationships, etc.).

This lack of confidence plays out in a number of different ways.  Dal-Rae fails audition after audition in her quest to become an actor.  Ji-Hwan and Dal-Rae's exceedingly handsome boyfriend,Young-Hoon (Lee Sang-Woo), constantly compete with each other except in martial arts competitions.  Ji-Hwan is unable to confess his feelings to the one he truly loves.

Things start to get complicated when Ji-Hwan begins dating a long-time friend of Young-Hoon's and go completely awry after something terrible happens to one of them.

'Almost Love' is a little bit romantic comedy, melodrama and romance all put together and was the 3rd highest grossing film in Korea when it was released in 2006.

The subtitles were pretty good overall.  Still not sure about the translation for ""Hong Kong"", though.  Couldn't they just have said ""Hong Kong""?",1361577600,6,1252,5.17910447761194
3929892,5,B000RJSINK,"I loved this movie! The beginning is a little silly as so many Asian films are but, if you can get through the first few minutes, it is delightful. Both the lead actors do a wonderful job. It is a soft, tender love story....just the kind I like!
I have watched this several times on Netflix and now will buy it as I know I will watch it again and again.

3929915,5,B000RJSINK,"Well acted romantic comedy, with the right elements of drama, comedy and romance.  No spoilers, other than the movie is a feel good experience that you would miss out on if you pass it up.",1423872000,,188,4.371428571428571
3929916,5,B000RJSINK,Such a wonderful movie.  One of my favorites...this is my second time watching it.,1419206400,,82,4.857142857142857
3929917,4,B000RJSINK,"Though the search for Jackie Chan generated this movie in the result list, and the name Jackie Chan was briefly shown at the beginning of the move, I did not recognize any player in the movie as one being played by the ""real"" Jackie Chan.  The credit list (cast) was in Chinese that I did not translate so it might have been a cameo or a requirement by someone to list the name of an actor that was mentioned several times in the dialog of the movie.

The movie was okay.  The language used by the actors was Korean and the words showing on structures and  what was written was also in Korean.

The English sub-titling was often a little off from the context of the dialogue spoken by the actors -- it was mostly okay.

The nice thing about the acting in this movie was that it could be enjoyed by a person that could not understand the Korean language and may have some difficulties with the English sub-titles.

Actually, I let the actors, their expressions, and their body language say it all even to the point of seldom listening to what was spoken and ignoring the titling.  They did a good job!

I would say watching this movie would be fun for the entertainment factor.  If a person needs to have a general idea about what is being said, the English sub-Titles should be adequate to be able to enjoy the story and the plot!",1413072000,,1330,4.348178137651822

3929919,5,B000RJSINK,"When ALMOST LOVE was released with little fanfare in 2006, it became an unexpected hit, topping the most tickets sold category for two consecutive weeks. In retrospect it was not difficult to see why. Directed and written by Lee Han, ALMOST LOVE asked the audience to look at the vast continuum of what we call love in an ongoing attempt to fix its shifting emotional borders. Part of the reason that audiences resonated with the film was Director Han's bold decision to begin with traditional romance but finish with gritty realism and tragedy.

The leads are lifelong friends: the man Ji-hwan (Kwon Sang Woo) who wants to be the next Jackie Chan action film star and the woman Dal-rae (Kim Ha-neul) who dreams of becoming a serious dramatic actress. They met in the second grade. Park Ji-bin plays Ji-hwan as the very young boy who even then practices his kung-fu comedy routines and Jung Min-ah is the equally youthful Dal-rae who will declaim to anyone willing to listen. These youngsters were well chosen for their roles since they are truly lifelike shrunken versions of their adult selves. The pint-sized duo occupy a surprising amount of screen time since it is their interlocking interaction that sets the template for future crises. Director Han switches back and forth from tots to teens as he carefully delineates the nature of how one emotion such as true friendship can continually knock on the door of love but never quite enter. Han allows the entire cast (except for Ji-hwan and Dal-rae) to recognize that these two love each other but lack the resolve to move from friendship to courtship. Whether Ji-hwan and Dal-rae are second-graders or mature teens, they engage in a non-stop gentle teasing that masks a deeper commitment that neither can confront. Even as adults, when both officially date others, these others are surprisingly not jealous of the inordinate amount of time that Ji-hwan and Dal-rae spend together. One would think that these secondary lovers would fuss and fret over their continuous exclusion from the friendship/love bonds of Ji-hwan and Dal-rae but they somehow recognize that there is no need to be jealous since maintainance of the emotional status quo is a given.

The last third of ALMOST LOVE is a huge surprise as the film morphs from light romance to heart-rending pathos and tragedy. One of the four (I shall not here reveal who) suffers unexpected crisis and physical deformity. A traffic accident out of the blue upends one world while throwing into chaos three others. The physical pain of that one becomes the emotional pain of the others. There are no villains here. All four friends/lovers care for one another but it is a tragic certainty of life that in moments of crisis the physically stunted one must learn and grow to transcend the limits of the flesh and find a new path. ALMOST LOVE is a roller coaster of emotions that begins lightly changes heavily, before finally returning to a mesh of the two that enables all concerned to adjust to the realization that what we call love need not be the romantic variety at all but an ongoing feeling that caring is what drives all enduring human relations",1407888000,5,3159,4.85899814471243

3929924,1,B000RJSINK,Go watch any other Korean film in the world ever and it will be better than this one. There is no conflict until 90 minutes into the film. The sudden and ridiculous introduction of conflict is followed by 45 minutes of moping. Who are you people with your five star reviews??

8370370,4,B000RJSINK,"A corny, silly, but tragically romantic ""love"" story between two childhood friends who constantly flirt on the border between being close friends and a romantic couple. ""Almost Love"" stars a beautiful, lead female character (who needs to look more womanly, if you know what I mean) and a not-so-beautiful, lead male character (who needs to look more manly, meaning get a haircut). This movie entertained from beginning to end, but took a dark, depressing turn when the lead male character has his leg amputated after a car accident. That scene was somewhat unnecessary and detracted from the uplifting theme of this film, which is why ""Almost Love"" deserves only 4 stars. For 5 star Korean films, watch:
1. Shotgun Love
2. Love Impossible
3. The Art of Seduction
4. Castaway on the Moon

You're welcome :-)",1435881600,2,806,4.926470588235294
8370371,5,B000RJSINK,"One of the cutest, most endearing movies I've watched in a while. I don't really like the US chick flits/flicks? but I'm drawn to romance movies with a message that is unique. This one fit the bill. It's great to see a movie where such a love filled with depth begins with a friendship. Loving someone despite their faults is what love is about. I'm glad to see such a cute movie where the characters brought to life what true love and friendship entails. I still got a smile on my face. Yes, some parts were cheesy, but all parts (in my opinion) were lovable. Great movie.",1433721600,2,573,4.364485981308412
