325778,3,6301166736,"This  is the first sound version of the old Dumas story of two Siamese twins, Mario and Lucien , born into a prosperous family and separated at birth by a brilliant surgeon ,played here by H B Warner. They are raised apart ,one among Paris society and the other in the rugged Corsican mountains by the old family retainer(J Caroll Naish) where they have been forced to flee by the scheming Callona (Akim Tamiroff)who has killed their father and taken over their  family estates. They are telepathically linked -when  one is stabbed the other also feels the pain etc .They fall in love with the same woman -the elegant society belle Isabelle (Ruth Warwick)but this does not prevent them uniting to avenge their father's death and restore the family name

The adaptaion -by George Bruce and Howard Estabrook plays fast and loose with the original book  but it provides for lots of lively action including swordply ,knife fighting ,kidnapping and torture .Fairbanks is fine but for me is just a tad too ""heavy"" in tone to be in the top flight of swashbucklers like his father or Errol Flynn and there is a similar ponderousness to the direction of Gregory Ratoff .The rest of thecast are fine and this is an enjoyable,if not quite top drawer slice of rousing period melodrama
Please note -I saw the original monochrome version ,not the colourized one (thankfully ! I deplore colourization on principle)",1194739200,2,1399,4.8125
325779,4,6301166736,"This incredible Dumas tale, which has some basis in fact, is brought to the screen with great gusto on the part of Fairbanks, whose dashing feats rival in many scenes the acrobatic antics of his illustrious father. The story has two Siamese-type twin boys born in the fabled island of Corsica where they are separated by a brilliant doctor played by Akim Tamiroff. One child is sent to Paris to be raised, and the other into the mountains with family retainer J. Carroll Naish. In later years telepathy (yes, telepathy!) is the theme...Fairbanks does an incredible job portraying both Mario and Lucien; his separately unique facial workings, posture and vocal modulations make for a splendid job of acting.  Fairbanks excels in showing just how the emotional/intellectual telepathy works on each twin both  psychically or physically when the other is in danger & it's fascinating to observe. Tamiroff plays his role with gutteral relish and Naish is likewise excellent as usual. The special effects are outstanding (especially for 1941) and this film actually benefits from colorization. A treat for lovers of vintage adventure and derring-do films.",1032825600,26,1149,5.205405405405405
325800,2,6301166736,"The Corsican Brothers is a 1941 black and white adventure films from the Alexander Dumas novel (1844) of the same name. It was the 8th adaptation of the book to film, and would continue to be adapted including Cheech and Chongs The Corsican Brothers (1984) and Start the Revolution without Me (1970).

Douglas Fairbanks Jr.(1909-2000)  stars as the brothers. Fairbanks father had been one of the top stars of the silent era (Robin Hood, Mask of Zorro, Thief of Bagdad) so Junior began working early. He did a lot of relatively undistinguished work but did put in an amazing performance opposite Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen in Gunga Din (1939), earning him the top billing in this film. This was the last film he made before enlisting in the Navy where he worked as a Beach Jumper and earned several distinguished medals.

Fairbanks is OK in the role, but clearly not as swashbuckling as his dad or his contemporary Errol Flynn.

Akim Tamiroff (1899-1972) co-stars as a man with a vendetta against the Brothers family. Tamiroff was a busy actor in the 30s and 40s, although I think his best performance was in Orson Welles Touch of Evil (1956). He had been nominated for an Oscar for his supporting role in The General Died at Dawn (1936) and would be nominated again in 1944 in For Whom the Bell Tolls, losing to Charles Coburn (The More the Merrier) but he would win the Golden Globe. Tamiroff is more of a buffon than a menace in this film.

Ruth Warrick (1916-2005) plays the love interest. She made her film debut in Citizen Kane (1941) as Kanes first wife. She went on to make more than a dozen films and then transitioned to TV where she had recurring roles in All My Children (1999  2005) as Phoebe and Peyton Place (1967-9) as Hannah Cord. She was nominated for an Emmy several times, but never won. She brings nothing new or exciting to this role.

J. Carrol Naish (1896-1973) plays the Brothers mentor. He was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Sahara"" in 1941, ""A Medal for Benny"" in 1946). He was extremely versatile and could play an Indian (""The Whirlwind""), a Russian (""""British Agent""), an Arab (""The Crusades""), an Asian (""The Hatchet Man"") and a Latino (""The Kid from Spain""). He played the lead role in ""Sitting Bull"" (1954). He does his usual good performance, but nothing noteworthy.

Nothing about the film is remarkable. Acting, photography, music, and location are all OK. The special effects (Fairbanks plays his own brother) are mediocre even considering the data, and often out of true sync.",1435449600,,2517,4.71753986332574

325803,5,6301166736,"The reviews listed pretty much describe this 1941 movie well.  However, one listed the doctor as played by Akim Tamiroff.  I might not be spelling the name correctly, but the doctor was played very well by H.B. Warner who performed as he usually did...exceptionally well.  Akim Tamiroff played the villain Colonna and was not a disappointment.  But the lead, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was the true star, indeed.  After all these years, still a true star. It was a surprise to me to see Ruth Warwick as the female lead, but she, too, was very believable.  The supporting cast helped make this an outstanding action film.",1430179200,,615,4.809523809523809

325836,5,6301166736,"Here comes a true classic, penned by the master writer, Alexandre Dumas, who has written The Three Musketeers, The Man in The Iron Mask, The Count of Monte Cristo etc. I had seen the aforesaid movies on DVD recently, but this one was left out. When the movie arrived, I anxiously viewed it. There is enough swashbuckling action to satisfy that taste and some real good acting, especially by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. I saw the movie full of anticipation and was not dissapointed. The black and white movie, released in 1941 stars Douglas Fairbanks Jr., in the role of Siamese twins, separated by a good doctor after their parents were murdered in cold blood by the arch villain Akim Tamiroff. Unfortunately, both the brothers fall in love with the same girl, leading to tragic consequences. The print and the sound are perfect and the movie is slickly produced and enacted and even the musical soundtrack is marvellous. There is enough swashbuckling action to satisfy that taste and some real good acting, especially by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.and J. Carol Naish as the good doctor. I strongly recomment this movie to all classic movie lovers and also to the members of the new generation. A five star rating for this gorgeous spectacle.",1367280000,2,1232,4.871428571428571

325864,4,6301166736,"My title refers to my very earliest days as an avid film watcher when a Saturday matinee at the local Bijoux yielded wonderful films of this quality.  Douglas Fairbanks Jr. became one of my very earliest cinematic heroes.  How very appropriate that he should have become such a major hero in real life, cited for bravery in action during World War II - beginning not long after he finished The Corsican Brothers as a matter of fact.  Somehow it seemed appropriate for the Washington Post social editor in later years to report that Fairbanks was a guest at a state dinner held at the White House in Washington for the Queen of England.

In my romantic mind it was easy to imagine that he brought to the gathering all the dashing, suave, graceful manners and behavior he displays in this film, a swashbuckling tale of siamese twins separated by a brilliant surgeon who then sends them off to grow up in different venues.  One leads the life of a Parisian gentlemen of his day; the other learns the wiles of a storied bandit living in the mountains of their mutual birthplace, Corsica.  The Corsican Brothers was one of the very earliest films of my youth - like another reviewer herein I was no more than five or six - and its impression upon me was enormous.  Not only did it follow the Classic Comics story closely, it gave me my in Douglas Fairbanks Jr. my first movie swordsman, wonderful preparation to critically enjoy Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power, other icons of my youthful formation.  Yes, I realize many will know that Flynn's classics precede Fairbanks Jr. but I saw The Sea Hawk and Captain Blood, for example, well after The Corsican Brothers.

This film actually engages the mind to some extent, not relying solely upon heroic athleticism.  There is some reference in the script to whether the separation of the bodies of the twins will also separate their minds - the way they think, the way they behave.  These psychological allusions provoke greater interest in the human aspects of the story.  But those who wrote and directed the film do not distract us from our expectation of first-rate action and the whole action-adventure dimension of the story.

Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as he already had as Rupert of Henzau in the splendid Prisoner of Zenda with Ronald Colman, proves himself a worthy successor to his illustrious father, shining brightly in the dual role of the two brothers.  The supporting cast is uniformly fine with J. Carroll Naish, H.B. Warner, and Akim Tamiroff providing their customary excellence.

I am grateful to Amazon for making The Corsican Brothers available shortly after its release as a DVD and encourage the company to continue making similar DVDs available to collectors like me who delight in being reminded of a past long gone and fading quickly.",1334188800,10,2794,4.791666666666667
325865,5,6301166736,"""The Corsican Brothers"" is one of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.'s best swashbucklers.  He's most effective in the dual role and the supporting cast, including a villainous Akim Tamiroff, doesn't let him down.  The Alexandre Dumas story proves both exciting and moving, with fine duels and sparkling romance!

The VHS copy I was sent by Amazon features a bright orange jacket, and proved to be a well-made colorization of the original B&W film.

I also recommend Fairbanks' ""The Exile"", if you can find it.  It's a great pity that these two top-drawer swashbucklers aren't available on DVD.",1297382400,9,582,5.08421052631579
325866,5,6301166736,"I'm sorry. My English is poor. ""The Corsican Brothers"" was very popular in our country, South Korea, around Nineteen fifties and sixties, I think this is one of the most interesting swasbuckler movie -inclusive of action packed, full of romance, beautiful sword play scene- that I've ever seen. Yes, Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power, Cornel Wilde, Louis Hayward, They are my boyhood heroes.
Couple of weeks ago, I found this VHS in here. and I ordered this minute ""The Corsican Brothers"". The VHS has been arrived very fast to me from Keeweebook. The tape is very good, looks clean view.

When I saw it was available on VHS, I ordered it immediately still expecting it to be black and white and grainy.  We have a wide screen, flat-panel HD TV.  When the tape was delivered in record time, we were totally amazed that it was not only in color, but the picture was as sharp as any DVD we own!  It was not only a bargain, even on VHS, but it is one of our top favorites in a collection of over 300 movies!
