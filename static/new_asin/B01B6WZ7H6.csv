8749453,5,B01B6WZ7H6,"Quiet little movie about life for a bush pilot on the fringes of Alaska, suddenly changes to a cold war thriller about an hour in.  There is a love triangle involving this ex-Army pilot, an ex-Army nurse turned schoolteacher, and a native girl.

Pilot flies a Cessna 170 with skis, and there's plenty of footage off and on.

If you are sensitive to it, there is a wolf hunt by air at the very beginning to preserve reindeer herds, and then a trophy polar bear hunt 2/3 in to track down man killers, which isn't out of line with those times.",1468800000,2,540,4.326732673267327
8749454,3,B01B6WZ7H6,"Although I enjoyed seeing the actors in this film, I thought this movie was dull and boring; uneventful and slow in development. The outcome of this film was very predictable.",1464220800,,175,4.866666666666666
