8489188,5,B005YD11KG,"This recital is masterful. First, because Colombara's basso is full of colour., and
his histrionic value undeniable. Second, because staging each aria in full regalia,
-both scenery and clothes-,gives the sense of the full opera; most recitals have a
'concert-version' impression which detracts a bit from the dramatism of the opera.
Finally, the arias selection is among the very top of the repertoire. Bravo !",1495843200,,411,5.338461538461538
