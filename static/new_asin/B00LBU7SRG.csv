6479421,5,B00LBU7SRG,"Mini skirt space pirates, that is the official japanese title for the novel.
mouretsu space pirates is the japanese title for the anime and in english it was released as Bodacious space pirates.
I wish the show had more mini-skirts... just kidding.
you won't find much fan service here at all, just a bunch of lovable characters.

Why buy the Complete Collection?
The 3 disc complete collection is NOT interlaced!
Is it better quality? I sure would like to think so, but that will be up to your own opinion.

This show is not new, so I won't waste your time, but it has dual languages both English Dub and the Japanese Audio that should satisfy everyone at a great price.
Other similar shows you may have liked: the flower of Rinne, Penguindrum and Girls und Panzer.",1418774400,3,766,4.583941605839416

6479423,5,B00LBU7SRG,"Given the title, I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Everything about the show is well done, the characters, the animation, and the world-building. There are summaries elsewhere (though, notably, not on the disc case, what's written there is best ignored) so I'll just emphasize my favorite parts of the show. The main character is incredibly relatable and realistic, she's not the 'chosen one' that is usually (and lazily) found in sci-fi. She puts a lot of effort into being good at her various careers, and not everything goes perfectly either. That said, this is a pretty light-hearted show, so there's no ridiculously evil villain set on destroying world and there is no gritty violence to be found here. In general, it moves at a relaxed pace compared to many recent anime, and this allows it to show rather than tell how characters behave and events play out. And, amazingly, wonderfully, there is no fan-service leering at the characters.

Again, despite the title, this a remarkably original show, mostly for the reasons I mentioned. Its nearest to the 'Crest of the Stars' series, in terms of feel, but its smaller scale and lighter tone set it apart. The rarity of pure sci-fi shows alone makes this worth checking out, and I think most will be happy they did.",1415059200,9,1309,4.84375

8665067,5,B00LBU7SRG,"It's certainly a catchy title. When I first watched this on Crunchyroll I didn't know what to expect. This turned out to be a real winner. The complete collection has all 26 episodes. The opening theme song is one of the best anme theme songs and even features ex-Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman.
The story centers around Marika who is a high school student at Hakuoh Academy on Sea of the Morning Star. Sea of the Morning Star is an independent planet on the borders of a galactic federation. She suddenly finds out that she has inherited the Captaincy of the space pirate ship ""Bentenmaru"" after the death of her father. The series then covers her becoming captain and the adventures of Marika and the crew of the Bentenmaru. Broadly speaking there are four story arcs within the series. The first is how Marika becomes captain of the Bentenmaru. The second is how the Bentenmaru helps the royal family of Serenity unite and find an historic space-arc. The third arc is probably the weakest but the final episodes concerning space dinghy racing make up for the weaker episodes. The final arc points towards the future and details a conflict between the space pirates and the broader galactic federation.
This is a very well thought out and consistent series. A lot of time has been spent making sure that the space ships and ship combat are as realistic as possible. This thoroughness helps the story along and adds a depth to this series which is lacking from other space shows. The characters are also well thought out and whilst Marika is the main character other characters such as Blaster Ririka, Chiaki and Grunhilde also feature and develop during the series.
There's little or no fan-service. The plot and voice acting (in Japanese) are sufficiently good not to need fan service. The animation is great with a skillful blend of traditional animation and CGI.
You can binge watch this series without getting bored and come back to watch it again and again. Definitely one of the most well thought out and enjoyable anime series in a long time.",1515196800,,2054,4.788732394366197

8665070,4,B00LBU7SRG,"This was a strange one.  To begin with it is Yet Another Pirate Story, joining the long list of those published around the world from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Treasure-Island/dp/193707501X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Treasure Island</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Harlock/dp/B00DELKA2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Harlock</a>, based upon the true stories of those Western privateers who, uh, exceeded their authority between wars to become enemies of all nations.  Real pirates tended not to last to long, once governments began to cooperate, but in fiction they've lasted until today and beyond.

Our current story begins interestingly enough a century ago with space going Privateers, carrying copies of Letters of Marque issued by independence seeking planets rebelling against an interplanetary overseer, and while engaged in this fight both sides were overwhelmed by a galactic empire.  Not knowing what the future might hold, the independence seekers decided to keep an iron in the fire by maintaining the space going privateers at least by direct descent, and a century later Marika Kato, first year high school student, part time maid wearing waitress, and member of her high school's all girl yacht club, gets the surprise of her life when it turns out that the father she's never seen was the captain of the privateer Bentenmaru and she now has 30 days to decide on her future and that of the entire crew of the Bentenmaru.  Which way do you think she is going to decide?

On the one hand this story is a total surprise.  Not a pantie is seen as the (mostly) girls get involved in various intricate SF plots along the way before the final cage fight.  On the other hand most of these plots seem to be quickly and subtlety resolved at the last minute, leaving viewers backing up and looking for missed clues (there aren't any).  In addition fully half a dozen mysteries simply aren't solved or even noticed as unsolved, including the hour and a half of Nothing Happens in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bodacious-Space-Pirates-Abyss-of-Hyperspace/dp/B01C6S2A6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bodacious Space Pirates: Abyss of Hyperspace</a>.  This lack of excitement is worth noting in particular; it wouldn't have taken much tinkering to have Marika and the others exhibiting ""normal"" levels of anxiety in the face of threats of death or worse.  I'm not sure whether having everyone exhibit a complete lack of concern in the face of multiple horrible outcomes is intended to exhibit professionalism or insanity, but at the very least it is unnerving.

Which leaves me in a quandary.

Should all the piled up mysteries ever be resolved, I might have to raise this to five stars; should they be left as unfinished as they are now, I'd drop it to three.  In the meantime this makes for a very intriguing beginning.",1469836800,,2981,5.684684684684685
8665071,3,B00LBU7SRG,"Only half way through the show now and mostly this is a slow, smart, and respectful story of young girl space pirates rather than an exciting adventure. Maybe it gets awesome later, but the first 3 hours are not engaging.

I know that is not a whole review and some nerds may not like that, but seriously. 3 hours. That is like saying I get to watch Outlaw Star after a trip to the DMV and not everyone should be expected to be ok with that.",1461628800,,441,4.127906976744186
