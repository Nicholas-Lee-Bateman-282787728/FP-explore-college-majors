8000930,3,B0000DG98U,"Solid, if not imaginative, presentation of main routes, small routes, and tourist routes from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco, with stunning scenery you can never see from an airplane, and most of which you can't even see from your car window on the interstate.

Better of course is to take Amtrak across the USA, but while you are waiting you can see what that trip looks like, with with this dvd.

Criticisms: Do the trains really run that slow? And the time spent on the tourist routes were distracting-- are we taking the train for fun, or to get somewhere?

Are the trains a way to travel or is their purpose to provide an afternoon's entertainment for old retired white people with cameras?

Two 1-hour dvds would have been better, the second devoted to tourist trains.",1368748800,,778,4.698529411764706
