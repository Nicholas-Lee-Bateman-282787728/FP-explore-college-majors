4327695,5,B004CJQVNU,"We have all the PBS based DVDs (this will be #15 to date).  My grandchildren love that curious little monkey and all his adventures.  My one disappointment with this DVD is the repeat of the ""Curious George Rides A Bike"".  I had hoped this was a different epidsode, but alas, it is the same one as on the ""Curious George: Robot Monkey and More Great Gadgets"".  With all the episodes yet to make it to DVD, it would seem Univeral Studios could have chosen something different!  Episodes included on this DVD:

""Curious George Rides a Bike""  George loves his new bike, especially because it gives him the chance to help Bill with his paper route. But he gets distracted by some ducks, makes some paper boats out of the newspapers, and then, trying to fix his mistake, hits a big rock that bends his bicycle wheel out of shape. Can Mrs. Renkins find the right tools to help him fix his bike so he can find some dry papers, finish the paper route, and keep his promise to Bill?

""George and Marco Sound It Out""  George is a huge fan of the mexican band Lobos Platas when they play in the park's old bandstand. But when the old bandstand is torn down, George and his new friend Marco must find a new place for the band to play, but every place they try makes the band seem to sound awful. In the process they learn all about acoustocs and hoe things such as a carpeted floor and a high ceiling make things sound different.

""One in a Million Chameleon""  George could stay busy for hours watching Jade the chameleon - not only does she change colors, but she also has the world's fastest tongue. But when Jade escapes after George accidentally leaves her cage door open, he follows her trail right out the front door!

""King Doggie""  When a limo pulls up to the doorman's lobby, the Princess of Bratvia steps out and scoops up Hundley, claiming that he is in fact a Royal Doggie! To verify this, the Princess's Aide measures him and sure enough, Hundley's head is three buckles high, his body is four stripes long and, most importantly, he has the purple mark of Bratvian royalty on his proud chest. So it's up to his friend George to help convince the royals that Hundley, although very dignified, is just a regular dog of the people. True, Hundley's precise measurements are indeed those of a King Doggie - but could the leftover grape jelly on his chest be a clue to his real identity?

""Chasing Rainbows""  It's Steve and Betsy's first time in the country and who better to give them a guided tour of the forest than George? When a light rain casts a stunning rainbow in the sky, George decides to track down the end of the rainbow to see if there really is a pot of gold. Betsy and Charkie follow, but Steve is left behind while trying to take pictures of the wildlife. Thankfully, Bill rescues Steve from a moose encounter, and they enlist the Man with the Yellow Hat to help find George and Betsy. Can the Man's ""pot of gold"" lead the travelers back to the treasure of a safe home?

""What Goes Up""  It's ""Reuse Your Junk Day"" and George and the Man with the Yellow Hat have one last pickup before they go to the lake. But when they arrive at Renkins' Farm, they find a mountain of junk piled in the Renkins' living room. There's no way they'll finish the job before the suns goes down, which means no lake for George. While the Man is taking a load to the collection center, George discovers that he can use the ironing board as a lever to launch the junk out of the living room and onto the front yard. Soon, all the pigs, chickens, and squirrels are ducking for cover! George's ingenious invention got all the junk outside, but it's scattered everywhere! Did this little monkey cause more work for himself?

""The Inside Story""  George doesn't feel so well. There's a germ lingering inside his body that has him sneezing and coughing, while making very sleepy. In a cold-induced dream, George and Gnocchi travel inside George's body, chasing a blues-singing germ named Toots and his harmonizing Germettes through the monkey's nose, stomach, and lungs as George tries to rid his body of the germ.

""Sprout Outing""  George has just been made an Honorary Junior Sprout of Country County and is thrilled to be on his first trip with the troop. But when the troop gets lost in the woods, George not only finds himself separated from the group but he also discovers a man sawing branches off a tree -- a clear violation of Sprout rules! Can George prevent the man from harming more trees and earn his Sprout stripes along the way?

4327736,4,B004CJQVNU,"I was kinda disappointed of the fact that among the 8 episodes on this dvd, i found 2 of the episodes being a repeat from the other Curious George dvd's I own. But overall, the most important is that my son loves it and he is happy to watch the show.",1368230400,,250,3.9215686274509802

4327739,5,B004CJQVNU,"I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to let him watch some TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

This is one happy dad who loves that annoying monkey.",1366070400,,827,4.235668789808917
4327740,5,B004CJQVNU,Our 4 year old granddaughter loved this Curious George!  We are a family friend of George as we were introduced to him many years ago and have most if not all of the videos.  George is especially great for our little 4 year old as she lives in Germany with German as her mother-tongue.  George helps her with her English and for that we are all grateful!!,1365811200,,355,4.268656716417911
4327741,5,B004CJQVNU,"My kids (age 6, 4, and 2) love watching Curious George. They are quite entertained by these stories. I also like this video because it has educational sections with real kids learning real things.",1357862400,,196,4.794117647058823
4327742,5,B004CJQVNU,"My 2 year old loves watching Curious George on pbs while at home.  We must have several dozen episodes recorded.  Now when we go on road trips, we are able to watch Curious George thanks to the dvds.  They are the same episodes you watch on tv. Each DVD contains 8 shows totaling over 90 minutes of pure entertainment for our child to watch.",1355270400,,341,4.296875

4327744,5,B004CJQVNU,"If you kids are young (2 or 3), get this George DVD as their introduction to George.  There's nothing troublesome or worrying. Each of the programs included are charming & well within a young child's grasp. We don't watch TV, and so we only buy programs on DVD (in order to have more control over scary or inappropriate content).  These programs are safe viewing for little people while you cook dinner or do a few chores....",1338336000,3,425,4.578947368421052
