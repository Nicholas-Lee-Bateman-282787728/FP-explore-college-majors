6229351,5,B00HVFA36I,"If you're like me, you felt you spent good money for this beloved TV show that was given sub-par treatment when it first came out on DVD. Michael Landon would have probably gagged if he had to watch it. But not this time. The picture is incredibly sharp and NO obviously cut scenes this time (not saying there are absolutely none but it's not in your face like it has been). It's also obvious that cuts to commercials are much less abrupt. Even though I'm listening via surround sound (the discs are only 2.0), it still sounds terrific and none of the volume problems that were evident on the first go-around are here. I should add the speed is back to normal which at the least means everybody is perfectly lip synced and nobody sounds too high pitched.  They even included the theme (which should have been  a no-brainer in the first place). And yes the pilot movie is included (another no-brainer).

Thank you Lionsgate for doing the right thing and giving a classic the star treatment it deserves. Keep them coming! People will buy them.",1395792000,7,1041,4.586021505376344
6229352,5,B00HVFA36I,"After going through a learning curve of what Ultraviolet is, I'm QUITE impressed with the quality and size of the video. On iPhone it is 543 MB,; iPad 1.2 GB.  I have been waiting for a digital copy for a long long time.
This will work with iPad, and IPhone, it will NOT work with iTunes.
To be able to watch the pilot whenever I want, is AWESOME!
10 hr flights to Vegas, and lay over time will be a breeze now.",1395705600,4,411,4.012195121951219
6229353,5,B00HVFA36I,"FINALLY we will see the uncut versions! In Sweet Sixteen, from season 6, Laura buys a new pair of shoes with heels so she can look older on her first teaching job. Almanzo falls in love with her this episode and Laura thinks it may have something to do with her shoes. They show her looking down at her shoes and smiling, but the scene where she buys them has always been cut! I only saw the complete episode just that once when it originally aired. I was 8 years old and have never forgotten it! This is gonna be AWESOME!!! And last weekend, I saw Alison Arngrim perform her Confessions of a Prairie Bitch and she even mentioned deleted scenes will be included. We discussed the Bunny episode in particular!! Good stuff!! :)",1393718400,14,725,4.417910447761194
6229354,5,B00HVFA36I,"For 21 hours of restored Blu Ray content, and at a cost of only $18, this is a no-brainer. Lionsgate could charge 3x more for this set, and still be justified.
I have a lot of the seasons on DVD, but will buy all sets again on Blu Ray.",1390867200,3,235,3.816326530612245
6229355,5,B00HVFA36I,I'm glad I never started collecting this series.  I never buy sets that include edited episodes.  Now they're finally releasing it  un-cut as well as remastered.  I'll buy it now!,1390435200,2,179,4.866666666666666
6229356,5,B00HVFA36I,"I would like to apologize for my previous negative & 1 star review. I was blaming the wrong company. I'm sure these new releases will be lots better than the other sets, however I'm going to wait for a few years for the complete series to come out. This is what I did with the old sets-and I'm doing it now. I deleted the other review & replacing it with this one.",1390435200,2,364,4.069444444444445
6229357,5,B00HVFA36I,"I purchased the new 2014 deluxe season one DVD set of ""Little House on the Prairie"" released by NBC/Lionsgate. I rate it five stars! These are the full length episodes (restored to broadcast length)! This series is full of good morality tales based somewhat on the real life of Laura Ingalls Wilder. The drama and comedy of this series are true to life and not a gimmick. It is as relevant today as it was in the 1970s and 1980s when it first aired on television. In addition to having the full episodes (including the pilot), this new release has much better picture quality than the previous DVD release. I am very happy with this new release! There is also some brief but nice bonus material about the history of the series. The six discs are stored in a durable case.
Note: Beware of the older DVD edition (""complete"" season 1 collector's edition) released by NBC/Lionsgate/Imavision. The episodes are not complete (scenes are missing) and the picture quality is not as good as this new 2014 deluxe (original broadcast length) release.",1356566400,,1039,4.745856353591161

I knew it would bring me warm memories, but I am surprised how much I love this more than ever 30 years later as I watch it now. The story setting is so real, down to earth, and touches my heart because it is connected with life, with believable characters. All the actors delivered their performance in sincere ways. I especially love the episodes ""Award"" and ""Racoon"". This production is far better than the tv productions these days which are often based on unbelievable stories and characters.",1517529600,5,662,4.765217391304348

6229480,4,B00HVFA36I,This one isn't quite as good as the others.  Maybe when they redid it more flaws came out.  I think remastering brings out sound flaws that the original didn't bring out.

The sound and picture on all of the episodes are great so far. I also love that the pilot movie is included for this great price. That is one of the main reasons I ordered this.

6229516,5,B00HVFA36I,I am confused about these reviews.  This Little House on the Prairie Season 1 set says it was released in 2014 and is remastered and is completely unedited and uncut.  Yet there are many Amazon reviews from years ago (2005 and on) that say this is edited and has many missing scenes.  Why are there old reviews on a product that supposedly was not released until 2014?  I'm just trying to find out if this series is uncut or not...,1432339200,4,431,4.35

6229519,5,B00HVFA36I,Just like I remember when I was young except for much improved picture quality.

And as a bonus, the set includes the television pilot that launched the series. The value (big key for me) was outstanding. A lot of bang for my buck.",1430870400,4,463,4.0989010989010985

Alot of mouths to feed and he makes it happen by Chopping Wood, Cutting boards and doing petty carpentry going to work everyday being someones little bitch living paycheck to paycheck with money troubles in his homemade built log cabin home. Turns out he was a Man's Man and went to the railroad to work to pay for hospital visit for his oldest daughter. He won arm wrestling matches at the county fair. Everybody looked up to him. He got to hang out with Mr Olson from time to time and see how the other half are living with running water, bathroom, toilet and working tub so one could bath properly. Micheal was a musky chap kind like an Amish Man, but with mainstream Christan Church going values. His kids went to an old school house built on a hill and didn't learn jack really.

I grew up with House on the Praire and the Waltons in the 70s and wanted my 3 little girls to have that experience watching each episode as i did. When this re-mastered version came out just this year I was very excited and we've now watched the pilot and first 3 episodes which are exactly as i remember seeing it with perfect picture and sound quality. Thank you so much Lionsgate for taking this project on and doing it so incredibly well.

6229594,5,B00HVFA36I,"I had to buy the DVD version after buying the Blu-ray. Blu-ray wouldn't play and no way around it here in NZ. DVD does with the right player. It looks and sounds great. Sound - (compared to the previous DVD release) - is very clear. Mono. Suits me. The series was made in mono.
You can hear and understand all the dialogue (except Carrie!). The David Rose sound track sounds great. You can hear little things like the pencil rolling along the girls' slate in ""Country Girls"". So much of an improvement on the horrible DVD release from a few years ago.

The picture, colours, detail - are amazingly clear and beautiful when compared to the last DVD release.
There's a lot of colour in this series. Lots of bright/dark (day to night) scenes. The blacks look true ""black"" when compared to the previous release, which were more a washed out dirty grey. Good blacks do make for a good overall picture. Close up detail and distant scenes are beautiful and so accurate - skin tones etc. Sound and vision looks brilliant even on DVD.

The episodes themselves have a different feel (pace) to them. Original, broadcast program length, I know, so could be that, but the last DVD set had a way different pace to them. Like rushing through the episode to get to the next. I'd highly recommend this set. It just looks, sounds so nice.

They've really managed to pack a lot of information in this Season one set. Video and sound are of such great standard - never seen such high quality on a DVD. I watch a lot of Blu-ray and this DVD, in my opinion is nearing Blu-ray. I didn't think DVD could look this good.

It's a shame Amazon have combined the comments with the old DVD release. It's confusing if you're looking to purchase. So many negative comments relating to the picture, sound. Deservedly so - I think the audio and video were horrible in the last release. These problems have been resolved with this remaster. This is a new product which needs to be able to generate its own comments.",1396915200,9,1981,4.50974930362117

I dislike it a little because it should had came with a booklet inside like the old DVD's did. But all in all the picture and the sound quality is excellent. A must have for all fans of the show.,1396310400,,354,3.9305555555555554
6229598,5,B00HVFA36I,"This is a great DVD set. My family are HUGE Little House on the Prairie fans, especially with the fact that my wife's family was from Walnut Grove, Minnesota from around the same time that Laura Ingalls Wilder was around the area. This was a well done DVD set and one that any fan of the series will enjoy. They have done a great job at digitally enhancing this series to making the colors and sound more vibrant than in previous DVD's that I have watched of this series in the past. If you have never experienced this series you should. There are so many family messages that I love to share with my own daughters from this series. Messages of family, friends and how to treat others are just a few of the themes and conversations that we have had in our own home, how about you?

6229599,5,B00HVFA36I,"This DVD set, I give all stars!!! There was a review on Amazon that said ""The Lord Is My Shepherd"" was cut!!!  Well, they must not have watched this episode before because I bought my copy last night and I fast - forwarded through the episode and all the scenes were all there.",1395964800,6,277,4.226415094339623
6229600,5,B00HVFA36I,"This is awesome! I'm only on the first episode of the series, but it's beautiful! Nice, crisp image. This first episode is longer than syndicated version on TV by about 6 or 7 minutes, though I haven't exactly figured where the extra time has come from. It was definitely worth the money, and I thought it was extremely fairly priced for a full season.

The show itself needs no review. I am 30 years old, and I've been watching the reruns on TV since I was 8. I've seen each episode no less than 10 times each, though this is the first time I've actually owned it for myself. I just love the show so much. I could listen to the theme song on repeat, it's just such a comfortable, homey song. The first season especially is great, even if the series does veer off into crazytown a few times in later seasons. The first few seasons will always be my favorite.

I hope the rest of the series is released quickly, I plan to buy all of them!",1395878400,4,937,4.229050279329609
6229601,5,B00HVFA36I,This is absolutely terrific.  I grew up watching this show only in syndication.  It's almost like watching the show for the first time.  The colors and the details are stunning.  Some of these episodes were hacked to bits in syndication and I'm seeing scenes that I have never seen before.  I am also pleased to see that Season 2 is getting the same treatment.  What I'm worried about is that they are going to stop there.  Seasons 3 and 4 are my favorites and they were also hacked up big time on the previous releases.  I remember hearing that Imavision had trouble securing the original footage for seasons 3 and beyond and were only provided with the syndicated versions.  I will breathe a sigh of relief when I have at least 3 and 4 in a beautiful edition like this.,1395878400,7,771,4.45
6229602,5,B00HVFA36I,"I'd forgotten how good and wholesome tv could be.  I loved this show growing up and when I saw this set I knew I wanted to get it and share it with my own kids.  The kids didn't seem too excited but I was and decided to watch anyway.  By the time the pilot was over my 6 year old said it was her third favorite show.  My 7 year old son was liking it by then as well.  The episodes look great, sound great- probably better then I remember them! It's just so fun to watch and even talk to the kids about life back in that time period. Couldn't ask for more.",1395792000,6,555,3.8333333333333335
