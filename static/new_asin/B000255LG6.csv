2062817,5,B000255LG6,"Nice way to paintbrush us all. I am a Christian conservative and absolutely love All In The Family. One of the best shows ever. I see that the one thing that you've unfortunately learned from this show is intolerance. Hopefully, you don't pass that along to your students.",1089331200,9,272,4.6875
2062818,5,B000255LG6,"All in the Family is a show that would be enjoyed by most people.  However, for people who truly understand and appreciate what this show was trying to do, it is must have television.  I am a history teacher and I have used some of these episodes to illustrate to my students some of the political, religious, social issues of the 1970's.  A lot of the humorous dialogue has to be explained because if you are under thirty years old, it just doesn't translate as well or just isn't as funny as it would be to someone who lived during this era in America.  The great thing about this series is that it is hilarious but at the same time there is a very sad undertone to the series.  It's hard to explain but All in the Family has a soul that I just don't sense in modern comedies like ""Friends"" or ""Everybody loves Raymond"".  Those shows are funny but very Hollywood.  Watching All in the Family makes you feel like you are eavesdropping  on the life of a real family.  Sadly, no show will ever be as controversial today because conservatives, especially religious conservatives, would threaten to boycott any of the shows sponsors.  Could you imagine a character like ""Mike"" (critical of the religion, government, war, the police, the pledge of allegiance / God Bless America, race relations, etc.)  existing in today's post 9/11 world.  We have gone from a show like this that makes you  laugh, cry, and most importantly think to reality comedies like ""Simple life"" and ""My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.""  Now that I think about it, I recommend you buy two copies just in case one scratches you don't want to be stuck watching lost episodes of ""Fear Factor.""",1089158400,25,1654,4.581632653061225
2062819,5,B000255LG6,"as tight&stif as CBS is a very Conservative vibe it's truly amazing a Ground Breaking show such as ""All In the Family"" made it's way on that Network.nothing was off limits.all subject matters&Issues were mentioned&Nothing was left unturned. the 3rd Season just like the first couple was Ground Breaking&introduced the Jeffersons to Viewers.a must have collection.",1088812800,5,363,5.5
2062820,5,B000255LG6,"The 1972-73 season of All In The Family,the sitcom's third,brought an addition to the cast. Sherman Hemsley is George Jefferson,wife of Louise(Isabel Sanford) and son of Lionel(Mike Evans). George is also the brother of Henry who was seen since the first season. It seems that George and Louise reconciled after a separation. George is a bigot like his brother and Archie Bunker(the late Carroll O'Connor). We hear George mention the word ""honky"",in reference to caucasians. We also welcome Betty Garrett and the late Vincent Gardenia as Irene and Frank Lorenzo,also neighbors of the Bunkers. Frank cooks and Irene repairs. Gardenia was seen in a first season episode as Jim Bowman who sold his home to the Jeffersons.",1087603200,5,718,5.145299145299146
2062821,4,B000255LG6,"This is arguably the BEST season of AitF.  And that's hard to say because the first 5 years were consistently top notch.  (Later seasons (6-9) had the show slowly become another stock and bland sitcom, keeping edgy/controversial stuff solely for sweeps episodes...
It gets 4 stars because Columbia House has built up a well deserved reputation of releasing poor quality DVD tranfers, at least for classic TV shows - I can't vouch for their movie releases though...  The main reason why it isn't less than 4 stars is because the master tapes don't appear to be in the best of shape either and it probably isn't profitable enough to restore.  :-(
This series is a must-buy for any fan.  Some of it is dated, so twenty-somethings and younger may not appreciate it.  A pity, every generation needs a show that dares to confront.",1084492800,14,824,4.7272727272727275

Finally, they brought another season on DVD, and I hope they will continu the series on dvd! I also hope they will release the other seasons in a faster rate. This is ridiculous, more than a year between the release of seasons!

2062862,5,B000255LG6,"Season Three of All in the Family. Once again, many other reviewers have provided episode synopsis and the like. This season the DVDs did away with the problematic menus from the previous season that sent me flipping back and forth through the various DVD menus. Beyond that, one gets every episode from the third season and the splendid mix of serious and almost falling on the floor comedy. I think that is where All in the Family excelled in that they didn't beat the viewer over the head with either. So many shows these days veer too much in one direction to the point of either depression or ridiculousness.

I really feel that this season really picked up with episodes like Edith and the Swingers and Archie is Branded, which I believe is the most disturbing episode of any of the All in the Family episodes. Everybody seemed to really hone in on their character and the results played out on the screen. My one downside is that the individual season sets have no extra features, but this could just be me applying a modern day expectation to a time when things like DVD sets or even VHS releases were not even a consideration.",1419465600,3,1135,4.563725490196078

2062877,5,B000255LG6,"Season Three of ""All in the Family"" has enough laughs and classic humor to make it hilarious and still very special even today, although as others have noted I do wish this three DVD set had come with some extra featurettes or a commentary. The quality of the print is a high average; but that's not much of a bother when the high quality control comedy is all THIS good. The season also won an Emmy and a Golden Globe award for Outstanding Comedy Series; and just one look at these episodes will tell you why! The acting is outstanding and very convincing all the way through and the character development becomes more and more clear as the season progresses in these twenty-four episodes.

Although every episode here is a winner, I do have my favorites and I'll list them to give you an idea of just some of the highlights from this season of AITF.

Archies Fraud -- Its bad enough when Archie is audited by the IRSwhat makes things even worse is that hes failed to report income from driving a cab part-time!

Gloria and the Riddle  Gloria (and one of her girlfriends) have a riddle for everyone in the Bunker household to ponderwhy cant a doctor operate on a car accident victim because the victim is their own son! Look for even liberal Meathead Mike to be stumped by this one!

Lionel Steps Out  Things get pretty heated in the Bunker household when Lionel, one of their African-American neighbors, goes out dancing with Archies niece Linda who is, of course, white! Archie is furious; watch what happens when Lionel and Linda react.

The Bunkers and The Swingers  Edith misunderstands the real meaning of a magazine ad when she responds to it, inviting a married couple who are swingers to the Bunkers for what Edith thought would be an innocent night of mere socializing and getting acquainted!

Mikes Appendix  Mike (and Archie) wants a male doctor to perform Mikes appendectomy even though Mike and Gloria have a great friend and qualified female surgeon friend who will do the operation for much less moneylook for Glorias reaction and it isn't pretty!

Mike Comes into Money  When Mikes Uncle dies and unexpectedly leaves him money, Mike donates it to the George McGovern presidential campaign. When Mike reminds Archie of their financial arrangement things get heated and very funny fast!

Flashback: Mike & Glorias Wedding, Parts 1 & 2  Very funnyprobably the best two shows of the season!

Archie Goes Too Far  The latest family feud has both Edith and Gloria storming out of the house to attend a female slumber partylook for Mike and Archies reactions!

Class Reunion  Archie doesnt want to go to Ediths thirtieth high school reunionuntil, that is, he discovers that an old flame of Ediths, Buck Evans, will also be at that reunion!

Everybody Tells the Truth  Mike and Archie have vastly differing views and memories of a repairmans recent visit, with the focus of their disagreement being on a knife! This episode is hilarious!

Gloria, the Victim  Sally Struthers does a superlative job in this episode as she portrays Gloria who has been physically attacked by a would-be rapi$t. We learn it might not be so easy to get the guy convicted.

Overall, the third season of ""All in the Family"" will not disappoint anyone who is a fan of the show or anyone who likes comedy with a message to it. Even if you haven't watched the first two seasons you'll have no trouble enjoying this season if you want to start with this three DVD set. I highly recommend it!",1390176000,8,3474,4.686985172981878

2062891,5,B000255LG6,"I've been a fan of ""All in the Family"" from its inception in January 1971. Every week I looked forward to the next episode. I watched the summer reruns. When earlier years made it to daytime TV I watched them as well. As far as I was concerned, ""All in the Family"" was the funniest half hour on television. Once the DVD's came out I picked them up as well and have watched all of them at least twice.

When Season 2 was aired I thought it couldn't get any better. (That season contains quite a few classic episodes.) I was wrong. Season 3 was better still. Among the best of Season 3 are these:

""The Bunkers and the Swingers."" Edith answers a classified in a magazine she found on the subway. The ad reads, ""Mature fun-loving couple wanting to swap good times with another mature fun-loving couple."" Edith invites them over. At first Archie is indignant until he finds that they have brought him a whole box of top-of-the-line cigars. This changes his attitude entirely--that is, until after some classic moments, the Bunkers discover that ""swapping good times"" means far more than they have anticipated.

""Archie and the Bowling Team."" Archie wants desperately to be on a prestigious bowling team. When a slot opens up he has to bowl against the other candidate. They both wind up with the same score. Archie is elated because the other fellow is black and he is sure he will make the team because he is white. Imagine his chagrin when he is informed that he was passed over precisely because of his skin color.

""The Class Reunion."" Edith is reluctant to attend her class reunion until she finds out that the ""golden boy"" of the class, an athlete named Buck Evans, will be there. Archie, suddenly jealous, insists on going along. Of course, he has a miserable time while Edith is enjoying herself until Buck Evans shows up. Buck is now bald and grossly overweight. Archie quickly brings him over to meet Edith and is baffled when she totally overlooks his current condition and sees him for the wonderful person he was and still is. (""What I'll never understand, Edith, is how you can see a wonderful person and all I see is a blimp."") This is one of the best ""All in the Family"" episodes of all time.

By Season 3 the main characters really come into their own. This makes each episode even better.",1375315200,,2302,4.550724637681159
2062892,5,B000255LG6,I love All in the Family and I can watch over and over again. I grew up watching this on TV.,1373932800,2,92,3.4285714285714284
2062893,4,B000255LG6,"Archie Bunker is a male chauvinist who reminds me of my Dad. The scripts for All in the Family addressed some of the prejudice of the day in a humorous way. Archie told it as he saw it without regard to political correctness. He was often shown up as bigoted and small-minded guy which made for some of the more humorous scenes in the series.

People still have prejudices today but they tippy-toe around them out of fear. I don't recommend that we all speak up about every thought that crosses our minds or that we express ourselves in personally insulting ways, but some of this so-called political correctness is turning people into sheep who are afraid of offending someone.

America has a few articulate people who aren't afraid to speak up today but they are often threatened and ridiculed for telling the truth by the very people who claim to be the victims of prejudice. Why should any group be given a pass on freedom of expression while others bite their tongues?

My husband and I find the episodes of All in the Family an amusing and mostly honest portrayal of the 60s. We watch them when we want a good laugh.",1371427200,8,1122,4.517241379310345

2062895,5,B000255LG6,"I remember watching this show when I was a kid and was glad my son told me his teacher showed the DVD version to his class in school as a way of teaching them how ignorant it is to be prejudiced and racist from a humoristic point of view. My favorite episode is in Season 3, 'Everybody Tells the Truth.'

Michael and Archie have different versions of what happened when the refrigerator goes on the blink. As we see what happens in flashbacks the versions they tell are undeniably funny. No one could have played Archie like Carrol O'Conner, and the same goes for the rest of the cast. They fit the parts they played like Andy Griffith and Don Knotts did their own.

If they could only make shows like this today, TV would be a lot more fun than it is now.

I would definitely recommend getting this. I feel like this season really made the show take off as seen in the following seasons. It's kinda funny that I love AITF so much and  understand the show the way I do because I come from an entirely different generation then when this and ABP were aired.

2062926,3,B000255LG6,"I'm not the biggest fan of this series. So other reviewers might offer better insight. But like I said before, I think we miss a crucial point if we don't understand that while Archie is a bigot, he is on a journey that will eventually lead to acceptance and even love of groups he is bigoted against. (Remember, there are 9 seasons of AITF, and then 4 seasons of ""Archie's Place."")

This 3rd season has what I consider 3 main focus episodes. The 1st is ""Archie and the Editorial."" This somewhat defines Archie's character. He is very anti gun control. His reasoning lacks virtually any rational thought. (Though it is funny.) Though I feel obligated to point out that Michael couldn't just let Archie 'let it out of his system.' He forces Archie's hand, and Archie goes on tv and says why 'everybody should have guns.' And then Archie gets robbed. (Thus hurt with his own ideas.)

The 2nd main focus point is ""Everybody Tells the Truth."" This is an interesting episdoe in that we see that while Michael and Gloria see Archie as vicious, ARCHIE SEES MICHAEL AND GLORIA AS VICIOUS.

The 3rd crucial point I feel I should mention is ""Archie Is Branded."" We all know that at this point, Archie does not much like Jews. But in this episode, he actually makes friends with a Jewish man who shares his 'fight back views.' And as it turns out, this Jewish man is killed, and Archie is very saddened. (Note: this episode would not have been so poignant if Archie was a liberal. The very fact that Archie was anti Jewish was what made it so poignant when Archie felt horrible at this man's death.)

Overall, this is an interesting chapter in Archie's journey from bigotry to acceptance.",1303344000,,1677,4.58
2062927,5,B000255LG6,This is my favorite season of All In The Family. It is such a funny show. Edith is really funny. I don't really have anything else to say so I guess that's it. Good show.,1296432000,,170,3.8857142857142857

 This season ""All in The Family"" continued to excel both in acting and story content, with shows dealing with bigotry towards blacks, sexual harassment, and the most daring, wife-swapping. The wife-swapping episode was one of the series' most well-known shows and featured Rue McClanahan (in her pre ""Maude"" and Golden Girls"" era) as a woman who shows up on the Bunker's doorstep along with her husband and wants to sleep with Archie!

 ""All in The Family"" would garner its second Emmy win as Outstanding Comedy Series and Carroll O'Connor would win his first Emmy as Lead Actor.

2062941,5,B000255LG6,"""All in the Family"" was, without a doubt, the best sitcom of all time.

It won Emmy's for Best Comedy Series as well as acting awards for it's four stars - Carroll O'Connor (Archie), Jean Stapleton (Edith), Rob Reiner (Mike) and Sally Struthers (Gloria).

I always felt that Seasons 2, 3 and 4 were the best of the show and Season 3 was a real standout with episodes like ""Flashback: Mike and Gloria's Wedding"", ""Class Reunion"", ""Archie is Branded"", ""Mike's Appendix"" and my personal favorite - ""The Battle of the Month"".  What I liked best about Season 3 is the growth of the characters of both Edith and Gloria.

2062943,5,B000255LG6,"This show is pure genious.  There are two reasons I like watching it so much.  One is that it's almost a study of the times, with women's issues, racism, politics and social values coming under the microscope of the writers with different characters representing different viewpoints.  Michael looks a little like David Crosby (of Crosby, Stills and Nash) and more or less represents the Woodstock generation. Lionel is a good additional character (and was a lot more interesting than the Lionel they used in ""The Jefferson's"" series that spun off this), with Gloria juxtaposing nicely against her mom (Edith!), and Archie as anti-hero (anti-Christ?).  It's amazing to see where we are now in relation to what was seen as revolutionary then. The second and MAIN reason I watch this show is that it just cracks me up.

One thing I will say about Season 3 is that it starts out kind of frenetically in the opening episodes with characters seeming to be a bit more high-strung or edgy than they were in Season 2 - not to worry, it quickly hits its stride, with Archie mellowing out a bit more in places.  And the acting is still pitch perfect.  Unlike a lot of sit-coms that followed, the characters in AITF always show a real acting range - that due in large part to the diverse and complex issues the show always loved to tackle.  These are no mere sit-com actors - they are REAL actors.  It's comedy, but it's drama too in a way, and it was the ability of the show to stretch its genre and go beyond the bounds of what 'sit-com' usually meant that almost put it in the category of art.  OK, I better not over-analyze it.  Suffice to say it is a hilarious and intelligently made show that reflects an era in American history well-worth catching again, especially in hindsight.

This is going to be extremely easy to scratch the discs. Now it would have been nice if they had sent these in slim-line cases, but these are 'piled' on top of each other. Cheap all the way! I also discovered that these discs do not play in my computer, (like every set I've ever purchased does). This set is going back tomorrow.

2062945,5,B000255LG6,"All In The Family: The Complete Third Season has all twenty-four episodes from the third season of this hilarious yet socially relevant television series. Considered groundbreaking and daring in its time, All In The Family remains one of the best television sitcoms we've ever seen and possibly ever will see. The three DVDs are packaged nicely with great artwork and brief notes about each episode. The quality of the print is very good and the choreography was brilliant.

There are twenty-four episodes; and truthfully they all deserve much commentary and praise. I will list some of the episodes that I believe to be particularly important or well done; and hopefully this will be of some use to you.

""Archie And The Editorial."" After a TV station's general manager gives an editorial to the effect that ""guns must go,"" Archie becomes incensed and wants rebuttal time on the TV station--and he gets it, too. Archie and his family then get robbed at gunpoint at Kelsey's bar in their own neighborhood! Also look for a subplot about Gloria looking for work at a local department store.

""Gloria And The Riddle."" Gloria gives the Bunker household a seemingly impossible riddle: A father and his son get into a car crash; and the father is killed. When the boy is rushed to surgery, the surgeon says ""I can't operate on this boy; he's my son."" Who's the doctor? There's also a subplot about Mike wanting Gloria to sew a button on his shirt partly because she's his wife.

""Flashback: Mike And Gloria's Wedding, Parts 1 And 2."" On Mike and Gloria's second wedding anniversary, Edith gets out their wedding album to reminisce. We get an elaborate two part flashback about Archie meeting Mike's family, Archie not wanting Chinese food at the wedding, Mike storming out of the heated discussion out of pure frustration, and Archie clashing with Mike's uncle over whether they use have a priest or a reverend perform the marriage ceremony. Look for two great scenes in which Archie and Edith each give Mike and Gloria ""advice"" for young married couples; and the laughs are big when Edith plays ""Here Comes The Bride"" on the piano.

""Class Reunion."" It's Edith's thirtieth high school reunion--but Archie won't take her and Edith doesn't want to go without Archie. Edith's cousin drops by to entice her to go; and Edith does decide to go--with Archie to monitor her--after Edith hears that her big high school crush, Buck Evans, will be at the gathering. The scenes in which Edith finally reunites with Buck and Archie meets Buck are terrific.

""Everybody Tells The Truth."" Mike and Archie are having yet another disagreement. The refrigerator is dead and Archie and Mike clash as to how everyone behaved that evening. Mike tells the story of Archie coming home like a frothing at the mouth stark raving lunatic bullying the family and the repairmen; while Archie insists that he was an angel while everyone else was picking on him and treating him poorly. There's quite a controversy about a knife that the repairman's assistant used, too.

""Gloria The Victim."" Believe it or not, they actually manage to handle the topic of attempted rape with a touch of humor here and there about foot-long hotdogs--and it all works well. Gloria is assaulted by a man as she walks past an empty construction site on a Saturday when she assumed nobody was there and she could ""save a few steps"" getting home from work. Fortunately, she is not raped; but the police detective gives everyone a lesson about just how tough it can be to convict a man accused of rape.

Overall, there's so many positives about All In The Family I couldn't list them here even if I tried. This three DVD set will bring you many laughs over and over again; and there are some very tender, poignant moments that are unforgettable as well. I highly recommend this DVD set for anyone who likes this sitcom; and it's even a great starter DVD set for people just discovering All In The Family as you can easily grasp who is who in the Bunker household.",1243900800,4,4005,4.760806916426513

Around 21.6 million viewers watched this season when it was first broadcast, making it the most-watched season in terms of viewers (though not in terms of percentage of TV sets, the second season's 34% of TV sets as opposed to the third season's slightly lower 33%). Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin's Tandem Productions would have even more successes this season, their third comedy (and first All In The Family spin-off), Maude, debuted this season as well, Not to mention Sanford and Son started its second season.

Anyway, to the episodes (NOTE - like my previous two reviews, episodes are in airdate order, not the order they appear on the DVD)

1. Archie And The Editorial (16/9/72): Archie is fed up with the TV editorials when this week's episode concerns gun control. An argument with Mike follows, then Archie decides to go down to the TV network himself and go on with a rebuttal. But this brings a negative side effect... 10/10
SPECIAL NOTE: Sorrell Brooke, who plays Mr. Bennett, the man at the TV network, is better known for his role as Boss Hogg on The Dukes of Hazzard (1979-85).

2. Archie's Fraud (23/9/72): Archie is driving a taxi on Sundays for some extra cash, but Archie has not reported this on his tax return, so he must go down to the IRS where he tries to bribe the agent. 10/10

6. Edith Flips Her Wig (21/10/72): Edith accidentally shoplifts a wig while telling bus directions to another woman, and becomes obsessed with the thought of becoming a major thief. 10/10

12. Mike's Appendix (2/12/72): Archie and Gloria both come home from work grouchy (on a side-note, I think Sesame Street's Oscar the Grouch was designed to be like an Archie Bunker for preschoolers), leading to another argument on women's lib. Mike needs his appendix out and argues with Gloria when he wants a more expensive male doctor, rather than a cheap, female one who does the same job. 9/10

13. Edith's Winning Ticket (9/12/72): Edith finds some old lottery tickets in her purse, leading Archie to moan about wasting money. Archie's attitude quickly changes when he finds out one of the tickets is a winner, but it's not his, but George Jefferson's, Edith was merely holding it for him. 9.5/10

14. Archie and The Bowling Team (16/12/72): Archie comes home in ecstasy when he finds out he could be on an elite bowling team, the Cannonballers. Archie tries out, but the team has to drop its anti-racist policies and takes a black man instead. 8.5/10

19. Hot Watch (17/2/73): Archie comes home with a watch valued at $300, bought for a mere $25. The watch breaks on him, and Mike tells Archie that the watch might be stolen, so Archie rushes to find a jeweller that'll fix it, no questions asked. 10/10

20. Archie Is Branded (24/2/73): Archie is getting the paper one morning when he finds a swastika painted on his front door. Naturally shocked, Archie calls the police, but before they can arrive, a Hebrew group wants retaliation. 10/10.

24. The Battle of The Month (24/3/73): Gloria's having the time of the month again, causing yet another brawl in the house and resulting in no-one getting any sleep. All this over Gloria's birthday! 9.5/10

It is just plain stupid and thoughtless that there is no menu option on this dvd that allows the whole disk to play without the user having to press buttons every 22 minutes. Can u imagine a CD that u had to press play on after every track? Disgusting.",1200009600,2,617,4.176470588235294

2062984,5,B000255LG6,"NBC loves to hang the moniker ""greatest ____ ever"" on its TV shows as if saying so makes it so. First, The Cosby Show was the greatest sitcom ever, then Seinfeld, then Friends. Of course, according to NBC, ER is the greatest program in the history of television, so we all have to discuss comedy programs in and of themselves. If NBC spent nearly as much time creating good new shows as it does in shamelessly overhyping their old shows, they probably would still be ahead of CBS in the ratings.

For my money, no sitcom will ever top the great All in the Family in any respect -- acting, writing and overall influence. To get an idea of what dire straits TV comedy was in before All in the Family, take a look at an episode of one of the other sitcoms that was on the air at the time: Family Affair, The Brady Bunch, the last, sad days of Bewitched, The Beverly Hillbillies. The country had grown up, but television sitcoms had stayed rooted in the same dated themes of the 1950's and 1960's: either sterilized white bread families or gimmicky hocus pocus that took the place of the quality writing of classics like I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners and The Dick Van Dyke Show. Subjects like Vietnam, flower children, drugs, poverty, racism, homosexuality and rape were taboos.

Enter Archie, Edith, Mike and Gloria who dealt with all those issues and more head on in every episode. While Carol Brady scolded her children for saying the word ""stinker,"" Archie Bunker held a lengthy dissertation on the phrase ""god damn it."" While Samantha Stevens was still dealing with her wacky witch and morlock relatives, the Bunkers were coming face to face with a transsexual. While the perpetually backwards residents of The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction and Green Acres discussed barn dances and pig raising, the Bunkers talked about the bombing of Cambodia and Watergate.

To be sure, Archie Bunker was a caricature -- a personification of all the old time, outdated prejudiced values that were so out of step in the early 70's. Creator Norman Lear's political perspective is cleary on the side of Mike and Gloria Stivic rather than Archie or Edith. However, Lear, who modeled the character of Archie on his father, wisely gave Archie Bunker a good soul. It's clear that deep down, Archie is a good person who can't deal with the changes in his life and the country without lashing out angrily at them.

The supreme achievement of All in the Family is that it takes all that anger and controversy and makes them funny. In the episode where the Jeffersons move into the neighborhood, for example, Archie's bigoted opposition to letting a black family could have made the situation ugly and very, very unfunny. However, Archie's opposition and fear is lampooned, making the point that discriminating on the basis of race is ridiculous. It's certainly deeper and more meaningful than Soup Nazis or finding out which two members of the Friends ensemble will sleep with each other next.

In addition, the cast is probably the best ever assembled for sitcom with the possible exceptions of The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Carroll O'Connor as Archie, Jean Stapleton as Edith, Rob Reiner as Mike Stivic and Sally Struthers as Gloria are absolute magic together and still manage to convey how much they love each other even while they argue about and disagree about everything. In addition, the supporting cast would later include so many great actors and actresses as so many great characters that All in the Family would spawn five spinoffs. A true measure of how much the characters come to mean to the audience is in the episode ""Gloria's Pregnancy."" When Gloria miscarries, Archie goes to comfort her. Even though he can't find the right words to say, the look that passes between Archie and Gloria is extremely moving and touching. The characters yell and scream the most horrible things at each other, but when push comes to shove, they are a real, loving family.

No matter how much NBC and other networks may hype their sitcoms as being the best ever, All in the Family will always be king. The show made television grow up and meet the issues of the day head on while still making the audience laugh and care.",1167350400,3,4231,4.741847826086956

One problem I encountered: when I select episode selections from the menu, the first note of the theme song seems to be cut off, as though the DVD skipped but actually did not skip. (it sounds like ""oy the way Glenn Miller played"" instead of ""boy the way""... we don't hear the first note on the piano...) This does not occur on every single episode that I select. Maybe it's a coding error...It is a bit annoying. I try to rewind several times and sometimes it repairs itself. I wonder if any of you new buyers encountered this imperfection.

2062990,5,B000255LG6,"The #1 Nielsen rated program from 1971 to 1976, All In The Family is quite simply one of the greatest television programs in history. Inspired by The Honeymooners and The Flintstones, All In The Family features its own loud-mouthed, opinionated blowhard sporting a hidden soft and sensitive side. Like Ralph Kramden and Fred Flintstone, Archie Bunker fulfills his role to absolute perfection, and the result is TV magic. Well-written and outright hilarious, All In The Family broke ground in the 70's with its willingness to tackle all the social issues and societal taboos of its day. Topics included racism, bigotry, sexism, homosexuality, death, and other namby-pam, socialist and liberal-feminist ideals (or at least that's how Archie would put it!) A titan among television sitcoms, All In The Family spawned a pair of shows which topped the ratings in their own right - Maude and The Jeffersons...

Carroll O'Connor plays the role of Archie Bunker, the titular head of the Bunker household. Loud and crass, Archie freely dispenses his bigoted remarks and ignorant comments from the living room of his Queens, New York home. Joining Archie is his loving and ditsy wife Edith (Jean Stapelton), his beautiful and progressive daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers), and her ultra-liberal husband Mike (Rob Reiner) whom Archie refers to as ""Meathead"". As Gloria and Mike's modern ideas clash with Archie's old school beliefs, all hell breaks loose in the Bunker household, but the Bunkers don't spend all their time arguing as they're inevitably held together by the immutable bond of love...

The All In The Family (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Archie and the Editorial"" in which Archie ardently defends his anti-gun control views on a TV editorial show, only to be held up by a pair of muggers wielding a gun when he leaves the station. The incident causes Archie to transform into a gun control advocate... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Lionel Steps Out"" in which Lionel Jefferson takes Archie's niece out on the town (peeving Archie who believes whites and blacks don't mix), and ""Mike's Appendix"" in which Archie and Gloria fight over the credentials of female doctors when Mike is forced to have an emergency appendectomy...

2063001,5,B000255LG6,Nothing beats this show.  Archie was recently rated the number 1 television character of all time by Bravo for a reason (Edith was number 12).  Highly recommend since the re-runs that are seen on various TV stations are chopped by about 2 1/2 minutes a piece.,1101427200,4,259,4.608695652173913
2063002,4,B000255LG6,"I am a diehard AITF fan since it first aired so I don't care about extras or digital remasterings.

What is being shown on the DVD includes the footage that hasn't been aired in thirty years because it was trimmed out so they could show more commercials in syndicated reruns.

This series was a seminal piece of television history. In the current political climate of hypersensitivity and political correctness a series like this could never be produced and it is a sad commentary on how low American culture has declined.

I don't know what is holding up the DVD releases but I would snap up the entire series plus ABP in a boxed set in a second and I wish that is how they would just release this series.",1099526400,7,706,4.457364341085271
2063003,2,B000255LG6,I love AITF. Always have. And was very excited about the fact that 'it' was going to be available on DVD. It was - as most of us know - a 'landmark' TV show. It changed TV. But what a shame. The picture quality of the DVD is absolutely horrible. NO better - in fact - than the VHS tapes I have of the show. [that I taped myself] And what excuse is there for no 'extras'? Compared to other 'complete seasons' - like the 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' or 'Here's Lucy' [among others] the AITF is a disgrace. Even the box it comes in is done on the cheap. Without question - AITF should have been [at least] digitally remastered. 'All in the Family' is a 5-star show. 'The complete third season' is a 2-star effort. [at best] I have no idea what the first and second season are like - but I already feel as though I've been robbed - and am not about to make that mistake again.,1096934400,8,867,4.076023391812866

The shows look and sound great. The 'subtitle' option is hilarious with the way they represent Archie's 'Bunkerisms'. I will buy all the seasons when they eventually come out.

2063008,5,B000255LG6,"""All In The Family"" Season 3 comes to DVD with the introduction of this handsome 3-Disc set from Columbia/Tri-Star Home Entertainment.

 This boxed set gives us all 24 episodes of the show's third season (which was its second FULL season, following the 13-episode half-campaign from Season One). Episode numbers 38 through 61 are here, divided among the three single-sided discs, and shown in their original video and audio presentation. Video ratio is Full-Frame (1.33:1); while the audio comes via Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono tracks (in English only). No DVD player-generated subtitles here though, which is odd since Seasons 1 and 2 included them.

 Picture quality, generally-speaking, seems OK here. Far from perfect; but OK. These shows, like the first two seasons of the series as well, were shot on ""Tape"", and not film. And from past DVD releases of ""taped"" programs, this usually means a generally less-appealing and lower-quality transfer to the digital format.

 Fans should be pleased by Columbia's addition of a ""Play All"" feature that has been incorporated into this 3rd-season DVD package. The first two seasons didn't have this helpful ""marathon"" option. Good to see they've added it for this release.

 Special Features are totally absent here (except for some ads for other Columbia DVD products).

 But, thank goodness, this third-season set DOES include chapter stops for all episodes. The first two seasonal sets of AITF didn't have any chapter breaks, which isn't a good thing, IMO. I prefer at least a minimal number of chapter breaks on DVD products, even for a half-hour sitcom.

 Especially important, in my opinion, is the inclusion of a ""break"" immediately following a TV program's opening titles. Such breaks *are* included in this DVD set. A chapter break of this nature is all the more important to have on these ""All In The Family"" episodes, due to the rather ""grating"" nature of Archie and Edith's opening-song rendition. After hearing Edith belt this out for the umpteenth time, in that fingernails-on-a-chalkboard way she had, I find it useful to bypass the credits most of the time. (Nothing personal against Jean Stapleton, you understand. She was marvelous as Edith Bunker. But, let's face it, she's no Judy Garland.) LOL. :)

 Season Three offers up some pretty humorous programs with Archie & Edith & Company, such as: ""The Bunkers And The Swingers"", ""Edith's Winning Ticket"", ""Archie And The Editorial"", ""Edith Flips Her Wig"", and the two-parter ""Mike And Gloria's Wedding"". All episodes are shown in full, uncut form -- each lasting between 25 and 26 minutes (approximately).

 Packaging for this set blends nicely with the first two ""All In The Family"" sets. The three discs are housed in a multi-panel fold-out case, which then slides into an outer cardboard slipcover. (Although, IMO, the innards of the box slide out from the wrong end of the outer slipcase, but that's a minor quibble.)

 There are two subtle packaging changes/improvements on this boxed set that I really like. One being the fact that the discs can be removed from their plastic trays/hubs quite easily (which is unlike some other multi-disc DVD releases, where it's almost necessary to bend discs to their breaking point before the things can be removed from their Digipack homes).

 But this AITF third-season packaging seems to be more user-friendly with regard to removing the discs from the case. Perhaps this is a sign that the DVD makers (from various companies) are really listening to consumer feedback with regard to complaints and concerns people have expressed about previously-released boxed sets where the discs were just ""too tight"" and difficult to remove. I commend Columbia/Tri-Star for this better packaging design.

 The other small change in the packaging that I think is a good idea is the location of the ""booklet pocket"". This set has the booklet ""right up front"" (so to speak). When you first open the inner case, the multi-page booklet is right there (without having to unfold the whole case). It's easier to get at.

 This is another solid season of one of the best comedy series ever to come to American television. Make room on the shelf for this DVD collection -- right next to ""All In The Family"" Seasons One and Two.",1091491200,32,4259,5.034188034188034
2063009,5,B000255LG6,"Yes those were the days...

 There will never be another show like All In The Family. This proved that the 'sitcom' could be used for political and social commentary. The best episode by far is ""Archie Is Branded"" the episode ends in a way you would never expect epecially for a comedy. Archie the Conservatist working-class man and his Liberal unemployed college student son-in-law Mike were always at it and the brilliance of the writing was in that they both had good sides to the arguments. This show never flinched from anything: racism, bigotry, violence, rape, murder all these and more are discussed in the third season. This series stands alone among others for it's ability to discuss politics and be funny about it at the same time.
