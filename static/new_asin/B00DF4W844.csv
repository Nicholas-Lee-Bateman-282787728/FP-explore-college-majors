5795747,4,B00DF4W844,This old VHS tape was in great shape.  My step mother loves working out to it.  It also arrived in a timely fashion.,1198713600,2,116,4.0
5795748,5,B00DF4W844,"Yes, it is a little scary looking at those leopard-print leotards and all that big, big hair, but don't let that put you off. This is a fun, easy-to-follow workout which combines some of the best routines from a bunch of Jane's videos. If you are a relatively experienced exerciser (as I am), you will not be wiped out by the end of this: you will be exercising at a comfortable pace and burning that fat away. If you are more of a beginner, there are always modifications to help you keep up.

The stretching section is thorough but not interminably long. As for the last section on diet and exercise, I often lift weights while I watch it. It provides a good reinforcement of basic, healthy information.

So go for it and enjoy this great workout, now in DVD format! I am really looking forward to seeing other Jane Fonda workouts out in DVD!",1125446400,3,844,4.438709677419355
5795749,5,B00DF4W844,"This is a really fun workout video. It has a lot of variety and takes several times to get the steps down, but it's not so complicated that you feel like you'll never catch on. I'm 16, and I think it's cool to step back in time for 50 minutes and see the ""old school"" outfits and watch Jane Fonda's perky crew. If you don't take yourself too seriously, you'll have fun with this one. I wouldn't recommend it for the advanced exerciser. It's not so easy that I feel like I didn't do anything (I always need a shower afterwards), but it's not super challenging, either. It would be good for people that are easily injured or are just starting out. There are modifications for people that can't do high impact.",1121731200,6,707,4.363636363636363
5795750,5,B00DF4W844,"I've owned this for many years.  Just took it out, tried it again and realized Jane Fonda's creation, as well as her sound advice as an aerobics professional,stands the test of time.  This is a compilation of a number of her workouts, seamlessly put together for a fat-burning 40-50 minutes of aerobics and stretching. Her nutritional info at the end is solid although not currently ""in vogue"".  This video was made at a time when fitness participants were encouraged to look like they were enjoying the workout- what a breath of fresh air! Personally, I don't get off on working out with the 'testosterone ladies'.. you know the ones, who believe the more miserable they appear, the better the workout must be!

I also wish there was a DVD of this- plan to keep it in the collection as long as the video tape holds out!",1095552000,5,820,4.595890410958904
5795751,4,B00DF4W844,"A video with the words 'fat burner' in the title really should rev up your engines, so I found this one to be a bit disappointing. It's just too easy, pulling segments from her 'Low Impact' and 'Stress Reduction' videos, which are low-intensity routines. But you won't be bored--the change of style, scenery, and music makes it fun and interesting. The moves are very easy to catch on to, even in the dancy 'Lean Routine' segment. Horrifying 80's fashion and scary electric blue leotards, but your eyes will soon adjust. Overall an easy workout for advanced exercisers, probably great for beginners.",1050796800,13,599,4.9405940594059405
5795752,5,B00DF4W844,"I enjoyed the variety of routines in this video, and the clever transitions.  It also does what is promises - ""Fat Burners"" - it's 50 minutes of exercise at a steady pace.  Easy enough for beginners to not be frustrated, but challenging enough to provide a good workout for the more advanced.  I was surprised to find that I enjoyed the discussion of diet and nutrition at the end, it's very well done.",1045699200,5,402,4.47945205479452
5795753,5,B00DF4W844,"This is such a fun video! The segments switch from one year to the next with a whole different look and attitude. It would be worth watching just to giggle at the clothes and hairstyles of Jane's exercise crew. Jane makes you feel like you're working out with a friend. Her segment on proper nutrition is very good also. This video does take a bit of coordination, though.",1027641600,3,372,4.485294117647059
5795754,5,B00DF4W844,"This is one of the few exercise tapes that I keep coming back to, again and again. It combines the best low-impact exercises from 4 of her best workouts (pre-1993). It is hard to get bored with this video as it hops from one year to another, different tapes and different styles. It combines a warm up, low-impact aerobics and a relaxing stretch at the end. This is a 50 minute exercise that is suitable for beginners to intermediate. Also includes a 15 minute segment after the exercise program where Jane discusses the truths about diet and exercise, and offers her personal advice.",1000857600,6,584,4.679611650485437

8592772,5,B00DF4W844,I received my Jane Fonda tape much earlier than expected. I'm excited. My exercise regime is so much better with this tape. Thanks Karin.,1482278400,,137,4.75
8592773,5,B00DF4W844,"This tape is old and hard to find, but swear by it for toning up, losing weight and staying fit for  those 50+ in age.",1442793600,,118,3.72
8592774,5,B00DF4W844,I still use her videos religiously!,1440892800,,35,5.0
8592775,5,B00DF4W844,"I have for many years trained with this video by Jane Fonda, and it was a joy for me that you could provide me with a new video
of Jane Fonda`s Favorite Fat Burners !  The old video could not any longer be used !
I thank you very much for this transaction !

8592776,5,B00DF4W844,Is this VHS made for DVD yet?  I really loved it but my VHS player broke and I am not buying another.,1388793600,,101,3.590909090909091
8592777,4,B00DF4W844,it is 60 minutes of aerobics that keeps you on your tows. I had this before so I was just replacing my tapes. I am very familiar with the tape and I do like it. I choose this tape when I want to take it easier,1368144000,,209,3.5652173913043477
8592778,1,B00DF4W844,thought this was a waste of time. I could do without her political stances and views and disrespect of veterans.,1365811200,,112,4.65
8592779,5,B00DF4W844,"This has been one of my favorite vhs videos for years. The variety is incredible, from Stress Reduction, Low Impact, Lean Routine, and Complete Workout, its a Jane Fonda Classic! The workout is over 50 minutes of non-stop movement. I wish I would have stayed with aerobics like this instead of high-impact jolting to my knees workouts.  When you're young you are fearless. The styles are old school, but I have always liked fashion history... I WISH THE JANE FONDA VIDEOS WOULD BE RELEASED ON DVD. LOVE THIS VIDEO!",1335657600,,514,4.775280898876405
8592780,5,B00DF4W844,"I love the video.  I get a good workout whenever I use it.  I notice and feel the firmness in my thighs and buttack,and I have more energy!",1249084800,,139,3.9285714285714284
