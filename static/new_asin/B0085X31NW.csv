8525701,3,B0085X31NW,"In the future the Brotherhood of Mars corporation has camps set up where hunting ""unwanted"" is legal. There are rules of engagement. Hunters get to wear protective shell suits that last for twelve and a half minutes. When one of the Brotherhood is forced out of the corporation and becomes one of the hunted, he gives them secrets that evens the odds.

This is a low budget film shot in North Carolina. While the acting is better than most low budget indies, it is still Asylum grade. Perhaps a low budget SyFy film would be the best way to describe the quality. The production is formulaic as you know where it goes and unfortunately it takes too long to get there, leaving me a bit bored along the way.  Kudos for what they did on their budget, but they needed to beef up the film more with decent dialogue. Crystal Largen is not Jennifer Lawrence.  Fighting choreography was weak.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.  2 1/2 stars",1407369600,2,939,4.5325443786982245
