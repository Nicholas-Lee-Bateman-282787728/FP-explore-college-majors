5859807,5,B00DVLKMWQ,"I wasn't aware of this film set until I searched for other ESPN Films.  Packaging is attractive inside and out.  The texture of the container feels nice.  Photos and descriptions of each film are excellent.

The stories subjects are good and should appeal to various sports enthusiasts.  I equate several stories to the Chris Evert and Navratilova 30 for 30 years ago.  They touch on being a woman in each sport represented and how views changed simultaneously.
.
I like the use of historical footage in a few films whether it was hi-8 footage or other formats.  Provides a sense of time change.",1400976000,,595,4.718446601941747
5859808,5,B00DVLKMWQ,"I wish ESPN would have continued this series, as there are so many fascinating women athletes to be profiled. I actually bought this set because it included the one about Katarina Witt. Purchasing just her DVD alone was around $14.95. I bought this set for about $3.00 more and got the whole series of documentaries. So far I've watched the documentaries on Pat Summitt, Sheryl Swoopes, Venus Wiliams and Katarina Witt. All were superb. I am looking to viewing the rest of these excellent films. I highly recommend these to anybody interested in women in sports.",1400371200,,562,4.864583333333333

5859812,5,B00DVLKMWQ,"I saw the ESPN shows on both Pat Summitt and Sheryl Swoopes - these are stories about a great basketball coach (Pat) and a player (Sheryl).  I order the gift set almost 5 months ago when it was advertised for sale on Amazon.  Ever since then, they are saying they need more time to give a delivery date - now on the order, it is to be released on October 15.  If I don't get notification that it was released that day, I will cancel the order.  I don't have enough cash to pay for things to sit forever in the seller's warehouse or in their dreams.",1380499200,,548,4.093457943925234
