4852473,3,B005OK0YIY,"Matthew Perry has been on a run of bad luck since Friends ended.  He's been in some good projects like Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip that haven't been given a chance to get their traction and flourish.  Mr. Sunshine looked like another good opportunity for Mr. Perry to find some post Friends success.  He played Ben Donovan, a self-absorbed manager of a San Diego sports arena.  The role was tailor-made for Mr. Perry (it didn't hurt that his production company produced the show) and he played well off the kooky arena owner Crystal played by Allison Janney as well as Crystal's child-like adult son Roman played by the very funny Nate Torrence. Jorge Garcia from Lost guest starred in a few episodes as one of the many arena workers Ben has contempt for. The show only lasted nine episodes. While it did start a little slow it felt like it was starting gain some momentum when ABC pulled it off the air permanently.",1322611200,3,918,4.579268292682927
4852474,1,B005OK0YIY,"These discs are made on demand and are as cheap as you can get.  There is only 1 home page option and that is play epiosdes and that menu looks like a 3rd grader created it. There are no chapters, if you hit the chapter forward button it will skip to next episode.  There are no episode titles or summaries anywhere in the package and the episodes are NOT EVEN IN ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Extremely dissapointed in the packaging of this short lived show I enjoyed.",1320969600,24,459,4.440476190476191
4852485,4,B005OK0YIY,"I never was a big television series watcher. So I never got to see this on TV.
So I purchased it , because I came to be a big ""Chandler fan"" when I purchased
""Friends"". I had never watched that show at the time, either. So this collection
was for our crazy ""Matthew Perry Night"", stuff we made up to do when we pop
in several Matthew Perry movies or series that he's been in. It worked for
the simple stuff we do.
Thanks",1380499200,,420,4.011904761904762
4852486,3,B005OK0YIY,Never purchased this. I do not have any idea if is good or bad but I have no idea how else to get this off my list,1360713600,,114,3.259259259259259
4852487,5,B005OK0YIY,"We got this because it's a very interesting series; Never had problems viewing the chapters...takes a while to download, but it worth it.",1355184000,,137,5.0
4852488,5,B005OK0YIY,"I first saw this show as a free pilot on iTunes and enjoyed it, mostly for the chemistry between Matthew Perry and Allison Janey. They play really well off each other as comedic characters that are deeply flawed. The show is short-22 minutes each- and the season wasn't that long so the instant video is the best way to view them-don't bother with the dvds. That said, it's a funny show about a guy who runs an arena and the characters who work there and acts that pass through. There's some funny stuff about a Jonas Brother, smurfs and dog shows but really Allison Janey is the best and Matthew Perry holds his own. More adult than Friends and with more mature characters, I enjoyed the entire season and laughed out loud a few times.",1344297600,,736,4.45925925925926
4852489,2,B005OK0YIY,"It was good to see Matthew Perry back on weekly series television. Sadly the show did not even last a full season. Happily it did make it to DVD. This DVD release has every episode even those not aired. And I am truly happy to have this show on DVD. What troubles me is the way it was slapped together. I have purchased MOD in the past but have never seen one so poorly produced. There is just one main menu. There is no way to select a specific episode other than hitting play and skipping ahead to the correct episode. There is also no way to jump to the next scene. In the end the quality is something I could have achieved on my home DVR. Very disappointing. But, if you are a fan of the show or Mr. Perry you will be glad to have these episodes in your collection. I rate this series as 5 star but sadly this release is 2 stars at best.",1335916800,10,841,4.011904761904762
4852490,1,B005OK0YIY,"They have a nerve charging $30 for this very poorly produced DVD - see review by D. Garza.  What a pity that this goofy, delightful show is being replicated like a pirated dvd.  It is a double pity that Mr. Sunshine was cancelled after 1 season.  Each of the lead characters was both cast and written perfectly.  This was one funny and unusual comedy that deserved a longer life and a professional DVD version.",1335916800,7,410,4.5
4852491,5,B005OK0YIY,"I love this show, and it was at a very reasonable price. It was shipped very quickly. I've watched it multiple times and there has not been any problems. Very impressive.",1335744000,,170,4.516129032258065
4852492,5,B005OK0YIY,This in combination with Studio 60 are the best of Matthews career. It is ashamed that the simple and dated friends is what he will be remembered by. I believe with Mr. Sunshine as it went on that we would see that he grew as both an actor and in terms of comedy. The fact that he created and wrote on the show is evidence he is talented beyond the memorization of lines. GREAT SHOW.,1333152000,2,383,4.12
4852493,5,B005OK0YIY,I thought this was a funny show.  Perry was fantastic and ROman on the show is also a great character.  Overall I thought it was fantastic but in this day and age of declining sitcoms and increasing numbers of reality television shows this show was a gem.  I am glad this dvd set came out.,1329868800,,289,4.218181818181818
4852494,5,B005OK0YIY,"This show is absolutely hysterical. Matthew Perry is amazing, Andrea Anders is gold, and Allison Janey steals every scene she's in. Unfortunately, this show was sabotaged by being placed against American Idol. I despise AI, but even I know that putting your rookie comedy against it is ratings suicide. This is a great show that unfortunately never got a chance to shine. If you like Matthew Perry or comedy at all, do yourself a favor and pick this show up.",1323475200,4,458,4.7375

8481370,5,B005OK0YIY,"I really wish they would have let this show run its course. The comedy was dry and very well written. Smarter than the audience...which is often the case with ""one season wonders"" lately.",1427155200,,187,4.696969696969697
8481371,5,B005OK0YIY,"Loved the cast, the show and the story. Matthew Perry is one of my favorite actors so he cannot make a bad show or movie.",1399507200,,121,3.88
8481372,3,B005OK0YIY,"I am very disappointed with this DVD set.  While I enjoyed the series, and was looking forward to watching it again on DVD, this is a very poor quality DVD.  Although it has the episodes that did not air, the series is not arranged in order on the DVD.  To make it worse, there is no menu at all.  You can't choose an episode.  Just click play and start from the beginning.  Every. Single, Time.  It's almost like someone recorded it from their tv and put it randomly on a DVD.  I would not recommend this purchase.  Unless it's on clearance for $5.",1395878400,,549,4.252427184466019
8481373,4,B005OK0YIY,"I have just watched four episodes of this which comes free in the far-off country where I live and work. My first thought was ""this is too good to last on TV."" Sure enough. (I thought Friends, especially compared to Seinfeld, was clear evidence of the dumbing down of America). Matthew Perry is great - witty quick, reacting and the rest of the cast meshes well. and the show in general sticks to a theme out of which the humour comes. This is not a show where the jokes comes first and the plot twists to follow them. It is something like a less-manic 30 Rock and is in fact more cohesive than 30 Rock. A lot of 30 Rock consists of fast one-liners and quick scenes as if they cant get the humour out fast enough
The wonderful Alison Janey has an excellent role as a the rich, selfish and sometimes unpleasant owner. Several of the characters are self-involved and some are slowly learning the importance of treating people like human beings., even your employees. This is humourously done and not mawkish. Matthew Perry and Alison Janey are often very funny  as they default to selfish arrogance under stress, with only a hazy idea that their nastiness may be inappropriate.; Matthew Perry's character is blundering towards treating people, even employees, nicely, and all the time! .
IMHO, this is a vital lesson for much of America, but mostly it is funny. If you like 30 Rock, Frasier, and Seinfeld you will enjoy this.
I cant say anything about the DVD quality.",1391644800,,1466,4.595419847328245
8481374,3,B005OK0YIY,"I love Matthew Perry and would watch pretty much anything if he was in it, in fact I have.  But, this one just made too many good actors into buffoons.  I wish someone would go back and look at the old hits of the 70's (All in the Family, MASH, Mary Tyler Moore, etc.) and emulate them.  Interesting comedy that required a brain to trigger a laugh.",1388188800,,348,4.164179104477612
8481375,1,B005OK0YIY,"My one star (would give less if I could) is not for the series, but for this release.  As a Matthew Perry and Allison Janney fan, I enjoyed the series.  It wasn't great, but it was entertaining and, I thought, improved as it went on.  This release, however, is a joke and not worth the money.  No episode titles, no chapters within the episodes, but worst of all - the episodes are grossly out of order.  So disappointing.  Why put out a release if it's garbage?  Save your money - don't buy this.",1386460800,4,497,4.279569892473118
