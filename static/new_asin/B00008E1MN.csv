1840967,5,B00008E1MN,"I've done the workout four times now and enjoy it more and more each time because I'm able to measure how much more I'm able to do and I'm able to focus more on the moves since I'm more familiar with what's coming.  I love the variety of moves and the fast pace of the workout.  No equipment other than light dumbbells (I use 3 pounds) is needed & the length at 45 minutes is just right.  I consider myself a high intermediate exerciser and I find this routine very challenging, which is good because the boredom factor is non-existent.  Once I'm done I know I've thoroughly worked my body and have a great feeling of accomplishment.  My spirits remain elevated all day, which is an added incentive given the current state of the world.  I highly recommend this.",1048809600,14,762,4.446043165467626
1840968,5,B00008E1MN,"None of the advanced workout tapes in my extensive exercise video library has ever challenged me--that is, until I used David Kirsch's Bootcamp Video.  I consider myself to be in excellent shape--I've been a runner for several years and exercise (cardio and/or weights/Pilates) 5-6 days/week.  I did not know what to expect after putting the tape in the VCR and was hoping to not be disappointed since I was familiar with Mr. Kirsch's ""Sound Mind, Sound Body"" fitness program.  Boy was I in for a treat!  The video is a fairly fast-paced workout that is definitely intense.  Mr. Kirsch effectively combines weight-training and cardio intervals to keep your heart rate elevated during the workout.  He also offers motivation throughout so when you feel like you can't do one more push-up, he pulls it out of you.  If you're bored with your current workout regimen or want to boost your fitness to a whole new level, I would recommend buying this video--you won't be disappointed.",1047168000,13,978,4.926829268292683
1840969,5,B00008E1MN,"David Kirsch's Sound Mind Sound Body Boot Camp DVD is the perfect answer for those who want to get fit, but have ""no time"" to do it.  In 45 minutes and with only two 3 lb. free weights, Mr. Kirsch takes you through a solid series of super effective toning and cardio moves, without ever letting you get bored.  His brilliant point of difference from other exercise videos is his encouraging way of reminding you to focus your body, mind and spirit as you are moving.  This special emphasis enables you to get maximum results while he moves you through the workout at an enjoyable pace; you never have a chance to think ""on no, how many more of these?""!
When you finish, you feel the satisfaction of having completed a great workout, plus you feel what can only be described as a kind of centered,energizing calmness.  I actually look forward to working out now!",1045267200,58,861,4.535483870967742
1840970,4,B00008E1MN,"After fast forwarding through the first two minutes of the corny scenes of David and his wife, this workout was really worth it!  Every move is designed to get the maximum benefit out of the entire body and the structure worked really well.

I would have given it five stars except for the mistiming also mentioned by other reviewers.  It was sometimes a little awkward to follow his pace.

These movements kept my pulse rate up for the entire workout and I love the fact that it's a very ""portable"" workout, only requiring 3 lb weights.",1117670400,10,537,4.5625
1840971,1,B00008E1MN,"I bought this and the Ultimate NY Body Plan DVD. I wanted a hard workout dvd. It is a ripoff as it is just 43 minutes, including stretch and cool down.  The rest of the DVD is an ""infomercial with David Kirsch"" where he talks pychobabble on body mind connection without saying much of anything coherent and a commercial""behind the making of the dvd"" segment, where he is mostly shown on the beach hugging and snuggling with his wife, and she has a segment on ""don't hate me because I have a beautiful body...""  I buy from Amazon all the time, but this DVD was a complete waste of money and the workout did not tire me at all.",1115424000,13,625,4.243697478991597
1840972,5,B00008E1MN,"I have to admit that I had never heard of David Kirsch before searching for new and challenging fitness DVD's.  After reading the reviews on this one, it seemed perfect: a challeging workout that whips your butt into shape!  This is no joke! David provides great motivation and inspiration guiding you through this workout.  It's a tough one, but well worth it!  There are alot of ordinary workouts that become easy after a few times, but this one provides challenges and new moves.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great, effective total body workout!  I am glad I took a chance on this one, and am now a big fan of David Kirsch's exercise and wellness plan.",1109548800,5,674,4.575
1840973,4,B00008E1MN,"I really enjoy this workout because it really gets the heart pumping right away and throughout the workout.  I work out at home and at the gym regularly and this workout is very challenging.  After 20 minutes I am soaked with sweat, and this is just using 3 pound hand weights. It's the compound movements that keep the heart up.  I've had to put it on pause just to catch my breath. I don't see myself betting bored soon with this at all.  The only problem is that David and the gang workout on the beach and it's not that easy to do some of the moves (mountain climber) on an apartment floor. Also, his count is not consistent (he'll say 5 more to go, and then he counts 1 rep and moves on...) Lots of jumping jacks so that's a concern if you have picky neighbors below.  This a very different workout.  Definitely recommend trying it.",1095552000,16,837,4.2993630573248405
1840974,5,B00008E1MN,"I love this workout DVD! In 45 minutes, David really works your entire body - and makes you sweat. It's one of my favorite workouts, and I highly recommend it. I would recommend getting his book, ""Sound Mind, Sound Body"" to compliment this DVD.",1090972800,,244,4.568181818181818
1840975,5,B00008E1MN,"This was really a nice surprise compared to other workout. It is really challenging, and since some exercises are with dumbbells, you can even make it harder...
It is fast paced, only a few repetitions per exercise and though I really got my hart rate up the whole time it was fun. The time really goes by fast, but after this workout you can feel what you have done. Kirsch really did a very good job to mix this set of exercises which blend together very good. The transition between exercises is fast, but after you have done it once it is easy to follow. It is so diverting, that you can repeat it regularly without getting bored and it really is a nice overall workout.",1088467200,11,674,4.357142857142857
1840976,5,B00008E1MN,"Heed the reviews!  This is an advanced workout!  There is a lot of jumping and strength moves (ie push-ups) that will be very, very challenging to the beginning exerciser.  For the intermediate/advanced - it's great.  Using 5 pounds is probably the maximum amount of weight you can use, without causing any injury.  This workout combines cardio strength moves, isometrics with the basics - squat thrusts, push-ups, crumches...etc.  You do feel energized after doing it!  David is a great motivator and not annoying at all.  In fact he is quite funny: ""Your butt...IT'S STINGING!""  My only complaint is the music.  It sucks.  I wish the music wasn't so wimpy for such an intense workout.  Also he does tend to speed up near the end of each set of exercises, but what can I say...he's pumped up!!  Other than that...let this workout change your body and your attitude.",1086220800,25,866,4.8493150684931505
1840977,4,B00008E1MN,"I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, but 20 minutes into this workout I was sucking wind!  The music is boring, David keeps repeating his ""mind, body, spirit"" mantra--which can get irritating--but overall, this is a great workout that will challenge you and get you results.",1085529600,6,283,4.895833333333333
1840978,5,B00008E1MN,"This is a good workout. I have tried other DVD workouts, and most of them don't really get my pulse up (usually they come in at about 100-140 bpm), however, this Bootcamp workout has me up in the range of 160-170, occasionally 180. For me, this is the requirement, as this is where the sweat starts flying all over the place :-).
When I started out about 12 months ago, I only used 2x2,5kg dumbbells, but have since added 2x3kg ankleweights, and I now use 2x5kg dumbbells, where I have gradually added weight, thus making for strength gains. In the beginning, I couldn't complete the entire program with the 2,5kg dumbbells, but now that seems like a walk in the park. I take this as an indication that the workout has made me stronger.
Whatever negative things can be said about this DVD would, in my opinion, be trivial. David Kirsch gives good instructions, has chosen good combinations of exercises, starts of with a gradual pulse climb during the warm-up and concludes with a bit of stretching - in my opinion, nothing truly bad can be said about this workout (EXCEPT for a comment, about midway through the workout: ""You'll be ready for ANY bikini, I SWEAR..!"" - since I'm a guy, I could have done without that).
Well, what are you waiting for, buy the damn thing ..!
You won't regret it.",1083456000,10,1294,4.55793991416309
1840979,4,B00008E1MN,"I bought this DVD because I had attended a Marine PT training class and wanted to have the workouts without the cost of the PT course.  This DVD is the closest to the real PT course that I have found.  The workouts are tough for beginners (my friend was panting 10 min. through) but with practice, you get further and feel stronger.  I love the PT drills, but they kick my butt!
Have fun with this one.",1076803200,5,402,4.194805194805195
1840980,3,B00008E1MN,"I like David's style in that he is trying to get the viewer to not only work on performing the exercise, he wants to get you to think about visualizing what it is you are trying to achieve.  So he is constantly asking the exerciser to do a mind and body connection.

I would have given this video 4 stars had his cueing and pacing been consistent.  I do a lot of home videos and so have seen good and bad.  They perform on the sand on a beach and this may be a factor in how well he paces some of the moves.  For instance he does an exercise where you swing your leg out in front of you in an arc and then do a squat.  Well he does some of them at one speed then another speed and then yet another speed.  It's means you find yourself out of sync with him if you keep a consistent rhythm going.  This happens in at least three of the routines.  The other point is he miscounts.  He will say you have 5 more to go and then end in 3.  Not a big thing but it is just one more thing that might annoy some.

I liked the actual exercises they are indeed going to make you feel like you have exercised.  I usually use between 8 to 15 pound weights with most exercise training videos but not with him.  Believe him when he tells you to get light weights.  I use 3 pound weights and towards the end they seem impossibly heavy as he does a lot more shoulder work than most videos.  High repetitions while also working the lower body will definitely make you feel it.",1074729600,69,1456,3.986159169550173
1840981,5,B00008E1MN,"I really enjoyed this workout. It was tough - I was reduced to a sweating, trembling wreck several times during the course of it but I kept going until the end (I do kickboxing frequently and considered myself fit!)
Whilst my muscles felt wrecked during the workout, the next day I was expecting to be in absolute agony, but was thrilled that I really did not hurt that much at all!!
I'm looking forward to doing it again, inbetween my cardio workouts.
Heck - if you need any more motivation, just think Heidi Klum!",1074297600,,515,4.48936170212766
1840982,5,B00008E1MN,"Wow, what a fun and challenging workout. I'm a 47 year old male in fairly good shape - work out at the gym 5 times per week and ski/bike hard when I get a chance. With January, the gym fills up with resolution makers to the point of over crowding and I decided to ""resort"" to this DVD to avoid the crowds. Now it is becoming my foundation workout offering great active strength conditioning that I wasn't finding in my gym workouts (I still ""Spin"" two days a week). I also like David's fun workout attitude that makes me laugh during some of the segments ""You are Hercules!!!"". Give it a try if you're serious about a sound body. The mind can't help but follow.",1073433600,2,661,4.296
1840983,4,B00008E1MN,"This is the best boot camp workout!  The beach setting is great and David Kirsch is an excellent instructor.  The only part I didn't like was the wimpy music which is very low in the background and sometimes the rep counts are not on beat.  Such an intense workout deserves more lively music!  Overall though, I am sure to feel this workout for days!  Highly recommended!",1072828800,,371,4.5606060606060606
1840984,4,B00008E1MN,"This is a tough work out.  David combines upper and lower body movements to make the most efficient use of workout.  The workout is fast paced, and David keeps it interesting.  The workout recommends using 1 - 5 lb dumbells. However, even without the weights, it gets your heart pumping within the first 15 mins of the work out.  This one is a winner.
I had a couple of small issues with the DVD, no closed captioning (to to follow the workout whilt watching TV in PiP) and the DVD has very poor menu navigation (had to restart the DVD to get back to the main menu.  Overall, this was a very good workout video.",1069113600,2,611,4.278260869565218
1840985,5,B00008E1MN,"I had hit a workout plateau and needed something to give me that extra boost.  When I tried the Boot camp workout, I was so relieved that I hadn't wasted my money on another workout video that I wouldn't use.  David Kirsch's Ultimate Fitness Boot Camp is by far the best all around workout I own.  The music is easy to move to, the setting is fantastic, and the workout is intense.  I noticed results within the first week.
If you are looking for the workout to push your routine over the top, this is it.  But beware, if you are not an experienced exerciser, this workout may be too much.",1062720000,3,589,4.27027027027027
1840986,5,B00008E1MN,"I purchased this DVD about 2-3 weeks ago and have been using it every day since I bought it. Since the day I started, I have seen dramatic results, especially in my legs and thighs. It has done a wonderful job toning and tightening my body overall and I would recommend it to everyone. :)",1055203200,9,288,4.254545454545455
1840987,5,B00008E1MN,"I cannot say enough great things about this workout. David Kirsch has filled a void lacking in other workouts. During the workout it is challenging, invigorating, and never ever dull or boring. You engage your mind, you feel the music and you definetly feel the burn! You'll get to the point where your body and mind becomes the power source it was originally meant to be. After a workout I feel calm, grounded and amazing! I started to see results immediatly. Truly fantastic. Trust me, if you want to fit into those Seven jeans again and look and feel great this is the way to go.",1051488000,14,582,4.5
7982178,3,B00008E1MN,I didn't do much with this once I got it honestly. . . . Its okay I guess but I only used his workout DVD and I lose 20 pounds,1472515200,,126,3.2333333333333334

7982180,5,B00008E1MN,"I like the workout in the DVD, because of several reasons:

1. It is a well-thought total body workout:
David makes the workout that works the entire body by either combining a cardiovascular effect with a traditional weight movement (e.g. jumping jacks with shoulder presses or extension of arms to sides and upwards), or incorporating total-body movements (e.g. squats thrusts, knee-ins).

The DVD has 4 sequences of jumping (they appear separated from each other, throughout the DVD):
-Jumping Jacks with shoulder presses
-Frog jumps
-Power Squats or Squat Jumps
-Jumping Jacks with extended arms to the sides and overhead

2. It is made for home, even one with no space
The most space-requiring movement in the DVD is the squat thrusts - in other words, you don't need more than the length of your own height.

I live in an upper floor of an apartment unit and am often worried that the impact of my jumping might annoy my downstair neighbors. I use a yoga mat when I do the workout, and this nicely absorbs the shock of my weight, wiping out my concern for noise.

3. The workout is adjustable to different fitness levels/daily energy levels with one's own modification
Yes, it's a tough workout, but because it is not technically challenging (we already know and can do lunges, squats etc.), after the initial trial of the DVD, I quickly learned to adjust the exercise to my daily motivation and energy levels. For example, if I felt very energetic, I might do the entire jumping jack sequence with shoulder presses (the standard one in the DVD is first jump the jacks around 10 times, then add the shoulder presses and jump for another 10 or so times, and finally jump few more times without the shoulder presses). On the other hand, on my lower energy days I might do the pushups with my knees on the floor and so on.

The DVD incorporates 5 pushup sequences (2 in the beginning, 3 towards the end).

4. The workout does not look silly in front of the ""home audience""
This may not be a concern for everyone, but I often feel distracted, if I do a dance-oriented workout at home, while the entire family watching. I know that I'm supposed to shake my booty and feel sexy for extra calorie burn...but in front of my grandma...?

This DVD is great on a day, when I have home audience because I don't feel ""silly"" doing lunges, side squats or arnold presses!

If you like a total body workout that requires little room and helps  to tone your body, this DVD won't disappoint.",1292544000,2,2479,4.613636363636363
7982181,5,B00008E1MN,"This is a very challenging DVD and well worth the money.  I found it initially frustrating because I was out of shape but I now that I have stayed with it, I am thrilled with my progress and the fact that I can keep up with it now.  I feel stronger and have more stamina.  When I want to sweat...I reach for this DVD!!",1208217600,,318,3.9375
7982182,3,B00008E1MN,"I did this workout twice in a row because it is overall that unchallenging - it's hardly boot camp? There are a couple of small areas that make you work hard but that's it. Also it's only 43 mins in full and that includes the warm up and stretch sections. I found David Kirsch very annoying through out. He doesn't give proper instruction on form (particularly in the warm up) so for beginners this could be dangerous and he miscounts which is annoying. He just doesn't shut up the whole way thru - I would prefer he waffled with information that is relevant to your form and the exercise you are doing rather than telling you how fabulous you're going to look on the beach or name dropping which he also seems to enjoy! If you have the time to do this workout twice in a row than you'll get more from it and I could certainly feel it the next day in my abdominal muscles but I don't think in the single format it really lives up to it's name - unless you are very new to exercise in which case it will be more challenging? However, if this is the case I would suggest you watch it thru once before actually doing it so that when you do it for the first time properly you can really concentrate on your form rather than his annoying babble and thus avoid injury. Overall I will do this workout again for variety but I just feel slightly disappointed that it is so easy (considering the name) and so short (I thought the workout would be 45 mins excluding warm-up and stretch).",1175558400,5,1476,4.275
7982183,4,B00008E1MN,"I like the DVD a lot, except some of the exercises are clearly not meant for the livingroom environment, but I pick and choose from the different fitnesses ideas and voila, I am rocking. David is really good in motivating constantly, and I even like the ""special Davids"".  For a normal human being, it is extremely difficult to get a personal trainer like David anywhere, so his DVDs are the best next thing",1152230400,4,407,4.575342465753424
7982184,4,B00008E1MN,"I feel I get a complete strength training workout, and it keeps my heart rate up with some cardio moves mixed in. I also like that he does a bunch of different exercises, which prevents boredom, and that they work multiple muscles at once. You get a full-body workout in 45 minutes. I agree with some of the other reviewers - his cueing definitely needs improvement, and some of his mind-body connection statements can sound a little hokey. Overall, however, I feel it is an effective workout, and I feel accomplished afterward.",1138838400,6,528,4.75
7982185,4,B00008E1MN,"Yes he knows what he is doing.  Yes he is a knowledgeable instructor.  However, he is monotonous, a little dull and he doesn't cue well.  This workout is good, don't get me wrong.  It's just that he needs to work on his 'on camera' skills and change up his voice and cue well ahead of time to let you know what's up next.  This is a challenge and it's definately a good investment into any ones collection.",1127174400,12,406,4.220779220779221
7982186,3,B00008E1MN,"The workout definitely left my muscles tired, but David Kirsch can be pretty annoying.  Saying things like ""Come on, don't think about those soap operas, don't think about that dinner.""  I thought he was a very ineffective and poor host.  It made me doubt sometimes whether he really knew what was good for a person's body or if he was just someone who got into working out and decided to make a video out on a beach somewhere.  He definitely does not seem like he's connecting mind and body - just talking the talk.

But, as far as the way my muscles feel after the workout, I can tell that they were worked pretty hard.  And I am left sweating and out of breath.  You do about 50 push ups by the end, lots of weights and cardio happens in spurts throughout it.  I own a lot of workout videos & workout over 5 days a week, and I'll normally do this one maybe once or twice a month.  It's hard, but not really fun and not a favorite.",1121212800,19,933,4.167597765363128
7982187,4,B00008E1MN,"With some reservations after reading other reviews of this DVD, I went ahead and bought it, and I liked the workout much better than I expected. It's like the old joke about smashing one's head repeatedly against a wall: it feels so good when you stop! What another reviewer wrote is certainly true: some of the exercises probably work a lot better on the beach (where Mr. Kirsch and his team work out on the DVD) than they do on floors, where most of us work out. The only way I could do that ""mountain-climbing"" exercise was to take off my shoes, so that my sweat-socked feet could slide along the carpeted floor; but then I had to stop twice, once to remove the shoes and again to put them back on. I have two criticisms of my own that I don't think anyone has mentioned. One is the lack of ""modifiers"" for people with back and knee problems. The other is no mention of how often the program is to be performed. I listened carefully, even on the ""informercial"" part of DVD, and also read the SOUND MIND, SOUND BODY book, and am still in the dark. Usually programs involving weights require a rest day between exercise sessions, to give the muscles a chance to recuperate and rebuild; but since this program involves light weights, should one do it daily? Has anyone else asked this question, or maybe caught something I missed?",1118275200,17,1330,4.477366255144033
