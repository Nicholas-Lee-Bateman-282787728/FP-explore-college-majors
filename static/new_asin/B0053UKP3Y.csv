4552445,5,B0053UKP3Y,"The truth is, I would never run in the Swiss Alps. I'm too uncoordinated. It would be dangerous for me. That doesn't mean I wouldn't love it. This DVD gives me the best of both worlds. I get to experience it without hurting myself.

The narrative is brief and doesn't get in the way. I found them helpful in keeping me on track.

I was using it while I worked out on my elliptical.

The running time is approximately 35 minutes. That's a good amount of time if you are running hard. You can also let it keep going if you want a longer run.

The locations are absolutely stunning!

It works for me.",1330041600,5,597,4.201754385964913
4552446,5,B0053UKP3Y,"The streets of Hollywood are just as I left them when I last visited there. I felt as if I were really there.

Positives:

Excellent locations, video, sound, instruction, and encouragement.

Negatives:

Only 30 minutes long.

I got an excellent run in, but wanted more than 30 minutes. I loved the city streets, but my favorite was the beach and forest area, and even the Hollywood Hills. That was a unique experience. I always wondered what was up there.

Very nice exercise option for my collection.",1329004800,,501,4.767441860465116

4552449,5,B0053UKP3Y,I love Italy and it's great to be able to go on a walk there from in front of my TV.  I don't have to go out and can walk as long as I want.  I do step walking with arm exercises every day.  These videos make it so easy and also makes the time go by fast while exercising.

4552455,5,B0053UKP3Y,"I have a number of Virtual Active dvds and this is amongst my favorites!  Good music, encouraging guide, and nice scenery (Venice, countryside, or coastal.)  I tend to chose the guided run, where Johnny provides supportive comments such as to stay hydrated, relax and breathe, or to take shorter strides during a climb. This run is quite challenging, beginning with a very steep climb right away (and then again about three-fourths into the workout.)  I appreciate little reminders telling me to relax my arms or to take long, slow breaths. While this was filmed predominantly in Venice, you do see other surrounding locals and some water, too!  I found it fun to be riding in a boat down the canal at one point in the cooldown or to be running along a beach.  And, during the steep climbs you're on a coastal cliff path or running with a beautiful mountain backdrop in the country.  One reviewer commented that she made the mistake of buying both hike/run Italy dvds and I am so glad to have each. The hike covers different locations than you will see here, like some tunnels and other coastal areas!  I love all of my VA dvds!",1398643200,,1128,4.61

4552462,5,B0053UKP3Y,"The natural scenery is beautiful, the music is upbeat and keeps me moving.  I've run to this DVD at least once a week for the past year, and I still enjoy it!

I own several DVDs of this series, and the Swiss Alps Run and American Southwest Run are my favorites.  I don't care for the town and city runs at all.  Also when the music has lyrics, it get tiresome very quickly.  On this DVD, the Bern run is dreary and I don't care for the music, so that's 5 mins of a 30 min DVD that I don't use.  Still the rest of it is really good, so I just repeat until I finish my run.  I could switch to my IPod, but then I would miss the occasional nature sounds, like rushing water.

They do a good job of keeping the horizon level, which is helpful when running on a treadmill.  Some of the Ambient collection runs let the horizon tilt so much I feel like I'm going to fall off the treadmill!  But I don't recall ever having that problem with the Virtual Active series.

Overall these are a good series of DVDs.  I just wish they would stick to trail runs and upbeat instrumental music.  Include more nature sounds.  Also slow down the pace a bit and make the DVD longer.  And kudos to them for keeping me motivated on my treadmill runs!  I really appreciate that.",1380153600,,1255,4.12396694214876
4552463,5,B0053UKP3Y,"I own 6 of these dvds and I LOVE all of them. I use them for mainly for riding my bike. The speed of the run works just as well for a bike ride. This was my most recent purchase of the Virtual Active series. It's full of beautiful views. I don't listen to the music that is on it...I just use my own. But what I have heard is not bad. These dvds make working out SO much more fun! I actually look forward to where I go on my 1/2 run, or biking. On a side note, you can find these cheaper & with free shipping elsewhere. Amazon took 9 DAYS for my free ship...where Totalfitness took just 2 days to arrive with free shipping , & was less expensive as well. I will not be buying more from Amazon, but WILL be buying more Virtual Active dvds!",1378512000,,738,3.9266666666666667
4552464,4,B0053UKP3Y,"I should start by saying when I first did this dvd I thought it was fantastic.  However, I am a bit more of a nature and not city person to run.  Also, some of their other dvd's are a bit more realistic.  I have done this a few times and will continue to do so.  No regrets with the purchase.",1377043200,,292,3.816666666666667
4552465,4,B0053UKP3Y,"I purchased this DVD as I wanted another virtual run to accompany my favorite -- the Chicago run.  While I am NOT even remotely bored with the Chicago run, I still wanted another run so I could give that DVD a break.

I purchased other virtual runs by the same company, and was rather disappointed.  However, the Los Angeles run, I have to say, while initially disappointing, got better as the run progressed.  For me, that's the difference between the two cities:  The entire Chicago run is entertaining; wherein the Los Angeles run, the first two segments, are slow going.  But it is a great run after that.

You begin with the Hollywood Walk of Fame and then through the city streets during the early morning hours.  As expected, the streets are somewhat empty and the hustle and bustle has not begun.  The scenery, when not on the Walk of Fame, is that of various buildings, graffiti laden walls and the local haunts.  It's slow going and can seem dreary for a run.  However, what I have found is, if you set this portion of the DVD to the right music, it puts you in a frame of mind that can make the run soothing -- a good way to start to rev up the body.

Next, it's Sunset Strip.  Again, early morning hours for the most part.  The streets are starting to get busy and you are exposed to the local shops, restaurants and more scenic sites.  Then, in my opinion, you get into the exciting part of the run.

There's the run through the Hollywood Hills.  As another reviewer commented, this part of the DVD is interesting.  As with that reviewer, I too had not been up to that area on my visits to Los Angeles.  It's a fun run.  With the exception of a few people, it's just you and the dirt/gravel path.  You wind your way up the Hills concluding with a view from atop the city.  The pace is good and because it's not mainstream Los Angeles, you're given a different take on the city.

Next is the run along Crystal Cove beach.  A nice run during sunset that is just serene.  Lots of joggers and walkers out taking in the beautiful sunset.  You even see a jogger (the guy in the red shirt) passing by a couple who appear to be saying ""hi"" to their friend.  It's a nice run and a nice pace considering at this point you've hit your stride.

Then there's the Icehouse Canyon Trail.  The run is over rugged terrain with lots of twists and turns.  The scenery is what you would expect on a trail:  Trees, woods, etc.  Still, it is fun nonetheless.

But the Mt. Baldy run is the most exciting.  Elevation...elevation...elevation.  You're running atop its peak for a fair amount of the run and you're mostly running along a narrow path. It's as if you're on a tightrope.  It's fast paced and exciting.  I find myself hooting because during times of the run, you feel as if you're going to fall off a cliff, especially when you're running at an angle along the side.  It's heart pumping and somewhat exhilarating, especially if you increase your running speed.  It's a good way to end the run.  Even the cool down is engaging.  It's even better than the Chicago cool down.  There's something about the way it is shot that makes it interesting.

While it didn't knock Chicago out of the top spot, it came close.  It's the first of the virtual DVD's, outside of the Chicago run, that I have used on multiple occasions and will continue to go back to.

Those of us who have purchased these DVD's have said it before:  They could be longer.  Thirty minutes is rather short.  They could bump these up to an hour, especially for the price.  But, I will take it for now.  I actually give this run 4.5 starts.  Recommend.",1374537600,,3612,4.388804841149773
4552466,5,B0053UKP3Y,"I purchased this DVD  to help get me through running on the treadmill.  I previously purchased three other virtual DVDs; however, in my opinion, this one is the best.

I love Chicago, so that probably helps.  Also, unlike most, I prefer running through the city streets as opposed to the countryside or trails.  I just prefer the hustle and bustle around me as opposed to more serenity.  But that's just me.

As with the other DVDs, this one is also 30 mins in length plus a 5 minute cool down. I start the DVD one minute into my running so that by the end (including the cool down [which I don't use as a cool down]), I would have run 3 miles.  After that (since I run 4 miles), I just restart the DVD and do one more mile.

What's also interesting are the little ""things"" you notice in the DVD.  For example, during the Lake Michigan run, at the beginning, you see a gentleman running near Soldier Field (white top/black pants) who you will see again at the end of the run.  During the Magnificent Mile run, towards the beginning, there's a woman walking down the street, who seems to have dropped her scarf and didn't realize it.  Also, almost at the end of each segment, you always see someone in a small group of people turn around.  It kind of lets you know that you're coming towards the end of that segment. And one other scene I find funny is during the Downtown run, as you're coming to the crosswalk, you see this red (though it looks coral) Audi A4 turning down the street.  As you're coming to the crosswalk, it's as if the driver sees you coming and he speeds up.  I just get a kick out of these little tidbits that make the run seem more real.

I have been using this DVD for over  2 months, twice a week, and I am not even remotely bored with it yet.  My runs fly by.  I just love it!!

As others have stated, these DVD's could be a bit longer in length.  For Chicago, they could have added in the area near the United Center and where Oprah's studio is/was.  They could have also shown the Navy Pier area as well.  Still, for me, this DVD does not disappoint.  Highly recommend.",1373068800,2,2095,4.258883248730965
4552467,5,B0053UKP3Y,"I purchased an elliptical several months ago.  Having used a treadmill for quite a few years, I was just wondering if ANYONE had created a ""virtual"" run that would help me stay focused and beat the boredom/monotony factor.  My elliptical has iFit capability, but due to some technology issues, I opted to bypass that (for now) and find some enjoyable, functional, visual tools.

VIRTUAL ACTIVE is, in my estimation, the FINAL WORD in state-of-the-art DVDs/downloadable videos for the person looking for a complete virtual outdoor experience.  I've tried the others on Amazon, but as helpful and innovative as they MIGHT have been in past years of the technology....they all now fall short in terms of technical BALANCE. There's much more to the virtual outdoor exercise visual experience than just running down a road, trotting along a beach, or jogging down a trail.  There should be DISCOVERY to keep the run/hike/cycling ""fresh"". There should be variation in terrain to allow for speed/resistance adjustments, even if manually done while you exercise.  There should be at least the option of ""coaching"" with a human motivator.  There should be a visual graphic of exercise expectation to keep you going.  Even the option of a music score to help with pacing and attitude.

VIRTUAL ACTIVE gets the job done. Sure, the runs are a bit shorter (35 minute average) and they ARE a tad more expensive (unless you purchase sets).  BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT!  Put it this way.  I purchased Virtual Active and 4 other companies' DVDs.  Each ""OTHER"" DVD averages $15 each.  I doubt that I will pop them in my player more than 15-20 times over their life because they just ""drag"" along monotonous trails/paths.  However, my Virtual Active products add variety, music, and motivation.  Even if used over and over again.  So..for the extra $4-5 dollars per DVD.....the value over time is obviously demonstrable while the other DVDs collect more dust than fingerprints.  With the 4 ""other company"" DVDs, that's $60 that could have been better invested in VIRTUAL ACTIVE DVDs.

Bottom line - stop looking at the ""other"" DVD producers.  VA is, for my dollar, the BEST investment for your exercise library. BUY VIRTUAL ACTIVE DVDs and smile your calories away while you sweat!",1366416000,,2257,4.983957219251337
4552468,5,B0053UKP3Y,"I never do reviews, but I just have to write one for this. It's the first Virtual Active dvd I've tried (and I waited to buy it because I thought $20 was a bit pricey). It's so worth the money! I've been to Chicago several times & this dvd is so well done. I don't know how they filmed it, but it is just breathtaking footage & you get amazing views of the Chicago Skyline. Super smooth and clear and really beautiful. You go through several parks, the Magnificent Mile, along Lake Michigan, etc. and it's just like you are there. It kept me on the treadmill the entire 35 minutes :) You run between people, and birds, and it's completely entertaining. I tried it while listening to the Guide, and he gave some neat facts about where we were and was also pretty motivational. I cannot emphasize enough how well this was filmed & how beautiful it was to watch. I really felt like I was back in Chicago. LOVED IT.",1366156800,,911,4.3023255813953485

Other than that, it's an awesome video and unlike others, you can switch from a ""guided"" tour or a tour with no guide (person talking).

I'll confess that when I bought the first VirtualActive DVD, I wasn't sure I would enjoy this Johnny Pearman guy who was our guide. It turns out that he is excellent with motivation, encouragement, praise, but keeps his comments few and far between. He pretty much stays out of the way of the view. The locations are spectacular choices. I couldn't be happier with them. They make my workout a pleasure. Each time I finish one, I set another one up for the next day so I can look forward to it. I've done a lot of travel and the great thing about these DVDs is, they take you places you might not get to go and you see more of it than most tourists see when they are there. Not bad with a fun workout thrown in as well. I may be out of new ones to try. I hope they make more soon. La Jolla, California would be nice. What about some of the Greek Islands?

Fine if you're not running (and running at 8 min. pace or less) but if you're running you'll find you instinctively 'lean' to avoid hitting things and that can lead to a fall. It did in my case; one minute I was fine and the next minute I was flying out the end of the treadmill belt. A couple of bruises and a 'belt burn' on my knee.

I've learned to look away when I see those weaving movements coming up but it was really stupid of the creators to do that.
