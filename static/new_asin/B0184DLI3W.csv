8741372,1,B0184DLI3W,"When this movie came out, I admit I fell for it .  Now, I see an unlikely plot that has a cougar seducing a young guy to keep him away from her daughter .  In case you don't know, female sexuality doesn't work that way .  I remember my conservative , Catholic history teacher saying that the movie "" left him cold "" .  He felt that sex was a dangerous thing to play around with .
  Much is made of "" Ben's ""  sexual inexperience as if all college kids had sex in those days .  Even today, 25% of college kids haven't had sex yet .
  This marks the advent of up-skirting in movies .  The ending is a slapsticky  cop-out crowd pleaser .
  If you like the Simon and Garfunkel  music ,  buy a record .  At the time, the song , "" Scarborough Fair "" ,  was foisted on us as some new work of genius .  I later learned it is a traditional folk song called, "" Girl From The North Country "" .
  Good acting .  The most memorable line ?  "" Plastics "".",1530403200,,940,3.831578947368421

8741377,5,B0184DLI3W,"Finally, the definitive DVD version of a 1960s American classic - and unsurprisingly, it's a Criterion Collection product.  All English-language Criterion DVD programs lack is subtitle options, but this particular package is otherwise about as deluxe as it gets: new 4K digital print restoration, plus an optional 5.1 surround sound remix; a pair of outstanding full-length audio commentaries (including one with filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and Academy Award winning ""Graduate"" director Mike Nichols together); a series of interviews (including a new, in-depth one with Dustin Hoffman); an enjoyable new conversation between octogenarians Lawrence Turman and Buck Henry, producer and screenwriter of the film, respectively; a couple of documentary featurettes, as well as a pair of vintage TV moments: a 1966 Mike Nichols interview by Barbara Walters from the ""Today"" show; and part of a Dick Cavett interview with Paul Simon, whose music (including the rudimentary ""Mrs. Robinson"" theme) was prominently featured in the film.  The final feature we get comprises three of the original screen tests for the roles of Benjamin Braddock and Elaine Robinson.  Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross appear together, and there would seem to have been no doubt whatsoever which pair was going to land the parts.

The two audio commentaries were the most valuable features to me in adding to my appreciation of the film, along with a number of details presented by Dustin Hoffman.  This is the film I have probably watched the most times in my life; but this time, thanks to these special edition features, I learned possibly as many as fifty new things about it.  From Dustin Hoffman I learned that when he (as Benjamin Braddock) suddenly (and memorably) interrupted his initial overtly physical sexual advance on Mrs. Robinson to go bang his head against the wall of the hotel room, it was actually a spontaneous attempt to suppress his impending breakout of laughter at a brilliant bit of improvised business by Anne Bancroft.  Mike Nichols, who we learn was one of those somewhat unusual directors who enjoyed being surprised by his actors on the set, naturally kept it in.  There are any other number of such unexpected moments caught on film and retained by Nichols, who was always seeking an extra edge.  The choice of the unknown Dustin Hoffman in a lead romantic role took the edginess prize altogether.  Hoffman was ""unusual"" and could more naturally play a suffering, angst-ridden, nervous (and whimpering) ""loser"" who wouldn't normally get the girl; as such, he was highly watchable and easier for an audience to identify with than some standard young leading-man type (&agrave; la Robert Redford, Nichols' friend, who wanted the part).

Film scholar Howard Suber's audio commentary from the 1980s offers illuminating analyses of every scene in the film - and one thing ""The Graduate"" certainly is, if not a great artistic whole (as a number of critics have strongly suggested), is a collection of brilliantly crafted scenes.  (Hence, the Oscar for Best Director to Nichols - although I think everybody else who was nominated for the film should have won; plus editor Sam O'Steen, who wasn't nominated.)

Some critics have come down on ""The Graduate"" for being 100% apolitical at a time of national crisis, with Vietnam and the campus anti-war movement raging (especially at Berkeley where the bulk of the latter part of the film was set - although campus locations were mostly shot at USC).  And how could the military draft not have been part of Benjamin's considerable pile of anxieties upon finishing his undergraduate education out East?  The fact is that this comedy-drama hybrid about a young man at the crossroads of his life, feeling lost and confused and less than a whole person, was published by novelist Charles Webb in 1963, in advance of the college-protest revolution, the accelerated drafting of young men for active war fodder, and the widespread use of drugs on most campuses (other than alcohol).  The film would have been made closer to that year except that Nichols decided to direct Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" first, ahead of ""The Graduate,"" which he had also agreed to do upon initially being offered the opportunity by producer Lawrence Turman.  The reality is that this film has a much more timeless feel without its being tied to contemporary references and is all the more universally appealing (and less skewed) for it.",1480550400,5,4508,5.128240109140519
