2663148,2,B000IU37WK,"I suppose the high point of the film, for me, was the rather incongruous sight of Christopher Lee, as Holmes, and Claude Akins, as Teddy Roosevelt, riding a steam railroad locomotive from a rather unusual perch.

I would have preferred to see it as an outtake on YouTube.

Overall, I would have to say that if the people who wrote, directed, and edited this film have any sense for pacing or dramatic tension, or any ability for the construction of mysteries, they left few clues behind.",1268265600,2,487,4.651162790697675
2663149,2,B000IU37WK,"This film is really not a Sherlock Holmes story at all.  It is much more like an Indiana Jones film with Holmes cast into the role of Indiana Jones.

This is not the Sherlock Holmes character that you're used to from the original Holmes stories.  Holmes is not the truly sharp-witted detective, one or two steps ahead of every criminal. Instead he  more or less stumbles onto solving the mystery.  This happens only after a lot of the cast has been murdered - no thanks to Holmes.

Watson is a good-natured bumbler in the mold of Nigel Bruce in Rathbone's Holmes.
Holmes even manages to flirt with women which the 'real' Holmes would never do.

While Christopher Lee does have many good acting roles to his credit, I would say this is not really one of them.  Some people seem to like his portrayal but to me he is quite stiff and looks out of character as Sherlock Holmes.

The film does have entertainment value. It is really more of an Indiana Jones-type film.  As someone else mentioned, there is no shortage of jumping onto or off of trains, getting attacked by aligators and lions, and searching for lost treasure in an ancient cave.

Some people like the fact that it includes some historical figures such as Teddy Roosevelt. To me this makes the film even more unrealistic.  A former US president is traveling by himself through Africa?  Roosevelt is also a bit of a buffoon in this film which doesn't ring true.

A few people mentioned that this is a family movie.  In fact there are two scenes where characters go off into the bush and are in the process of tearing their clothes off while they make out.  This is fairly brief in the course of the entire film, but makes me wonder if people actually saw the long version of the movie.

The film drags a bit in parts.  The plot itself has many twists and turns, but at some points hardly makes sense.  Not to give it away, but in the final scene you have to wonder, why is the criminal there at all?  Why hasn't he taken the goods and absconded much earlier?

By the way, this is actually a TV miniseries which may explain why the production values are not quite up to what you'd expect.

All in all, it's an entertaining, though fairly ridiculous movie.  True Sherlock Holmes fans would probably not like it. If you can put up with its flaws you will probably find enough to be entertained by.  If you want 'real' Sherlock Holmes you should look elsewhere.",1265241600,8,2416,4.463470319634703
2663150,5,B000IU37WK,"Excellent! Christopher Lee is Holmes. The plot...movement..and continuity make this a fun mystery..that keeps you guessing. I only wished more of these movies were made with Christopher Lee in them as Holmes....I didn't want the movie to stop....Plus!
the whole family can watch..a novelty these days...",1252800000,3,303,5.608695652173913
2663151,4,B000IU37WK,"A rollicking adventure played to the hilt by Mr Lee. The plot was a little thin and the lines were slightly predictable, but all in all, still an entertaining movie. Terrific inclusion of characters of the time... such as King Edward,  Lillie Langtree, Theodore Roosevelt, and Gugliamo Marconi.",1195689600,3,294,5.125
2663152,3,B000IU37WK,Enjoyed the movie. The only problem I had was the the audio sinc was slightly off on part of the movie - the dialog did not match up with the actors lip movement - annoying - otherwise I would have given it 4 stars,1173657600,2,214,3.8863636363636362
2663153,4,B000IU37WK,"This is the 2nd of 2 very long TV movies/miniseries featuring two wonderful actors: Christopher Lee as Holmes and Patrick Macnee as Watson.  (The following year a 3rd, ""Sherlock Holmes in New York"", promoted Macnee to Holmes.)  Like the first, it has faults and virtues, although ultimately weighted on the side of the latter.  As a side note, when shown on TV in this country, this film and its companion were each cut by about a quarter-hour.

However loosely - and it's very, very loosely - this film is related to an old Basil Rathbone film, ""Terror by Night"".  This involves transporting a fabulous diamond, the ""Star of Rhodesia"", with Holmes overseeing security.  ""Incident at Victoria Falls"" also involves a fabulous diamond, the ""Star of Africa"".  This latter is an actual diamond, although much larger than the gem displayed in the film.  That was the Cullinan Diamond, over 300 carats (well over a pound!) in the rough.  The Cullinan was eventually cut in to 9 large gems and a goodly number of smaller items.  These are all now part of the Crown Jewels.

The film's ""Star of Africa"", already cut and polished, is - like the Cullinan - going to be transported from South Africa to Britain, where it will be presented to Edward VIII.  Mycroft Holmes sends his brother Sherlock to provide security with a plan involving a glass duplicate of the ""Star"".  Yeah.  You all know how this turns out:  we get to play ""diamond, diamond, who's got the diamond?"" for the next couple of hours.  But it's all in good fun, only slightly spoiled by the banality of the script - I found myself on a number of occasions saying the next highly predictable line before the character who had it.  On the bright side, we only get a glimpse of Holmes wearing a deerstalker instead of being constantly treated to that particular wardrobe malfunction.

As for the rest of the cast, there are few that would be much recognized on this side of the Pond.  As to characters, it will turn out that one of them is a ringer - not really a fair cop, since we're given no clue that there's anything suspicious about him or her.  In the cast, several well-known historical names appear ... such as King Edward (played by the estimable Joss Ackland), Lillie Langtree (played by a fine actor, Jenny Seagrove), Theodore Roosevelt (played by the well-known Claude Akins), and Gugliamo Marconi (played by an unknown, Steven Gurney).

The settings for the film are scenic, and the action usually brisk.  The train trip from Capetown to Victoria Falls is a lot of fun, enlivened particularly by Claude Akins, who plays Teddy Roosevelt with appropriate and effective swagger and bluster.

The script writers may have assumed the viewer would already know of the relationship between Langtree and Edward VIII - but in any event, this fact never appears in plot or dialogue - not to mention the fact that Ms. Langtree's participation in the story contains elements entirely antithetical to her actual character.

The story takes a number of twists and turns, although Holmes's vade mecum, detection by deduction, sometimes falls by the side of the road.  In this respect, the film falls short of the standard set by the great Basil Rathbone ... not to mention the even greater Jeremy Brett.

Well, no film is perfect.  This one is a good evening's entertainment, over 3 hours long.  While the cast is generally average, Lee and Macnee give the entire film centrality and impetus.  The trick here is not to mind the various little problems and go along for the ride.  It's a pretty good one, especially the railroad.",1165881600,11,3581,4.756888168557537

8147380,1,B000IU37WK,Nothing impressive about  this stereotypical Sherlock wannabe production. What a disgrace to use  Conan Doyle character's name in this.,1516752000,,135,6.052631578947368

8147382,5,B000IU37WK,"I'm only 3/8ths through it.  I came to read these reviews, in my political correctness, to see if it was safe to watch.  I was worried about racism.  The movie, from this European consortium (including Papa Berlusconi of Italia), seems to be playing empire straight.  I was wondering if an Asian woman would be allowed to play polo with ""white"" men.  It seems at least Cape Colony was, around 1910 when the Union of South Africa was formed, a bit liberal, only requiring you to have money if you wanted to vote.  Africans were better not seen and not heard, as the movie so far faithfully depicts.  So far, all in all, a brave effort.  We escape into fiction not to escape from life, but to find the strength to face life.  Racism is a fact of life in modern ""white-land"" but those days are coming to an end.  I expect this movie has made its contribution:  the King of England can't own an African diamond, not even if the Cape Colony or the Union of South Africa presents it to him.  Not any more./// I watched to the end, and the king did get (steal) the diamond, but that's part of the dramatic effect.  I think Doyle would not have killed off this Holmes, cleansed, or I might say healed, of all political correctness.  The racism, without which there could have been no British Empire, was part of the story.",1515196800,,1314,4.398340248962656
8147383,4,B000IU37WK,"I loved the old movie.  Some of it was filmed at my high school, St. George's College.  The old buildings with the castle turret, the fields and interior.  I also loved the feel of the old colonial trains which were once of my greatest pleasures to travel on all throughout the Southern Africa area.",1514505600,,299,4.5

8147385,2,B000IU37WK,"Painfully bad and long and boring.  It should have been less then 90 minutes.  Cushing was an awful Holmes.  Patrick Macnee was a very good Watson, like the Nigel Bruce's portrayals.  Blahhhhhhh.....",1513641600,,199,5.125

8147388,2,B000IU37WK,"There is a very big difference between stories based upon the masterful writings of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and stories that merely imitate by inclusion of the characters of Holmes and Watson.

As B-grade made-for-tv type imitation Sherlock movies go, it is reasonably entertaining. However, there is a fundamental perversion in it that cannot be overlooked, which manifests as a comfort with meaningless killings. The Real Sherlock stories have within them a fundamental respect for life. Such is entirely absent from this.

But overall, it is a tolerable diversion if you like B-grade movies.",1510790400,2,593,5.297872340425532
