Simple as that. Always loved the original version (by Disney) and always will.",1230854400,,287,4.433962264150943
3594987,5,B001G2S3XC,This is the best deal in obtaining all three parts of the movie at a reasonable price.,1230336000,5,86,4.117647058823529
3594988,5,B001G2S3XC,"'The Little Mermaid' is by far one of Disneys most beloved animated features of all time so it is no suprise the studio chose to release two sequels to follow its success. What is amazing is how much of the life of Disney's Ariel is unveiled within this trilogy. Where traditionally Disney tends to set its sequels in an around the original, the whole mermaid trilogy spans over 28 years of Ariel's life, from her childhood days to her teenage years and finally to her life as an adult. It makes for an entertaining and really enjoyable watch as you witness each aspect of her life as it comes and how she develops as a character.

The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning is the beginning of this grand narrative (despite the fact it was made last). Here we meet Ariel's loving mother Queen Athena and witness her shocking death at the hands of pirates. As a result Trition not only declares mer folk cannot swim to the surface, but also all music must be expelled from Atlantica. We jump ten years ahead to Ariel a year before the original motion picture took place. She discovers music for the first time, meets her life long friend Flounder and finally makes a connection with her estranged father.

The Little Mermaid (the original) continues the tale. With music now restored to Atlantica, Ariel and her sisters prepare to give a royal concert, however Ariel has fallen in love with human things and forgets the occasion, encuring the rathe of her father. She arrives home for a scolding but it is also revealed she swam to the surface with Flounder. Trition does not want his daughter to die the way his dear Queen did years before at the hands of humans and demands Ariel never return to the surface again. But the problem is that Ariel wants nothing more then to walk on land. She then makes a pact with the sea witch Ursula in order to become human for three days in the hopes of being with her one true love, a human Prince named Eric. As you can imagine she does succeed in living happily ever after...

Hence we reach: The Little Mermaid: Return To The Sea, a highly fitting ending to the trilogy. Here Ariel gives birth to a daughter named Melody. But Ursula's evil sister Morganna wishes to use Melody in order to capture King Trition's tridant and take over the sea (something her sister had failed to do). Ariel sees no choice but to seperate Melody from the sea and hide her mermaid heritage from her. She finally understands why her father wished to protect her in the original film and, when Melody runs away, seeks to tell her daughter the truth and finally restore the alliance of land and sea that was broken so many years before.

Overall the series is highly strong as a trilogy. There are themes that echo throughout all three films unifying them as if they were originally intended to be viewed as one. Seeing Ariel grow as a character is most interesting as is the progression of many of the characters in the saga. The music is stunning in all three films and the recurrance of the 'Part Of Your World' theme as a tie between all three films really brings everything together. It is especially powerful in 'Return To The Sea' in the ultimate climax of the series in which choices must be made by not only Ariel but also her daughter. The other thing that is most gratifying is the theme explored in the films about parents and children. Ariel's bond to her mother through song, her strained relationship with her father and finally her relationship with her own child really gives the series a link that emotionally holds the series together and really makes for a satisfying climax in Return To The Sea.

Overall I recommend these films be viewed as one. I love the original Little Mermaid and I feel as a series, watched in order, this is the strongest trilogy Disney has ever produced.",1229990400,61,3814,4.562043795620438

3595177,4,B001G2S3XC,"i hesitated on buying this or seeing the last one, sure it couldn't be as good as the others. But I was glad to be wrong, the final/first story IS was well done as the other two. I'm well over 21 and still enjoy this set very much, kids love it too!",1238544000,6,249,3.8076923076923075
3595178,5,B001G2S3XC,"My favorite Little Mermaid movie was only the original 1989 release, but if the little ones in your household cannot get enough of her then buying this set saves money than getting all 3 movies seperately. It is also a great buy for the hardcore Disney fans young and old alike.

It includes a trio of sealed (have not opened mine) mini lithographs depicting a scene/theme from each movie: The Little Mermaid, The Little Mermaid Ariel's Beginning and The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea.",1236470400,,492,4.72093023255814

8303682,1,B001G2S3XC,Good price for all 3 discs. But a bummer when you buy for a little girls birthday to find out it won't play in my region. How bout you put that in your description. Will be sending back for a refund lets wait and see if I get it.,1524700800,,229,3.693877551020408
8303683,3,B001G2S3XC,"The product is great.  all 3 movies arrived on time and have great quality. I just wish i knew they were from a different region and require a different DVD player than i had before i purchased them. my husband had to reconfigure our laptop so they would work.  other than that, they are great.",1520985600,,294,4.327272727272727

8303685,1,B001G2S3XC,I was disappointed with this product as it could not be played on our DVD player.,1515628800,,81,4.125
8303686,1,B001G2S3XC,These dvds don't play in any of our players. I read reviews thar claimed they DO play in USA but they do NOT! We tried 3 different dvd players plus a computer. No luck.  I trusted those reviews that claimed they would work with American dvd players. But they don't. Don't waste your money only to disappoint your kids.,1514332800,,318,4.389830508474576
8303687,1,B001G2S3XC,Terrible!  Bought these for my daughter's 3 year old birthday since Arielle is her favorite. None of the DVDs work. Don't waste your money!,1508544000,,139,4.791666666666667
8303688,1,B001G2S3XC,I received my dvds and none of them work. I tried 3 different DVD players and all got the same error and they didn't support that type of DVD. I tried a new DVD player and 2 older ones. So I contacted the seller and they said they would give me a refund but that I had to pay for return shipping.  I don't think it's fair that their product was defective and didn't work and I have to pay to send it back.  So when I went to the post office to send it back it was going to cost almost $10 more than I paid for it to send it back to them (because it's Canada)so basically I'm stuck with DVDs that don't work that are going to go in the trash. Huge waste! Go to a different seller!,1500076800,,679,3.8085106382978724
8303689,3,B001G2S3XC,It was not specified that it was a UK import so of course it wouldn't play on my old DVD player. My husband and I had to buy a new player that was multi regional. We we're planning on buying a new blueray DVD player soon anyway but just not this soon. But now since we had too to see movie all.better. now we don't have to worry if it is a UK import or not and will play. Very happy to have little mermaid collection for my twins.,1498608000,,430,3.842696629213483
