797696,5,6304153554,I expected this movie to be something I have already seen before.  But what I got was something more and better than I had expected.  Good performances by all involved.,1126656000,5,168,4.566666666666666
797697,5,6304153554,"This is a lovely movie, quiet and understated. It tells of a middle-aged couple who run a tiny two-classroom school in a rural farming community in Texas. Joseph (Dennis Hopper) has a bum leg from a childhood accident and walks with a crutch. Rosalee (Amy Irving) was once his high-school sweetheart. She went on to marry his best friend but has been a widow since the end of the Korean War. They have been carrying on a tepid romance for years which seems to be going nowhere. Then comes Catherine (Amy Locane), a precocious 17 year old who enrolls in Joseph's class and becomes enamoured with the older man. Her torrid affair with him sparks off his cooling relationship with Rosalee. The film is rated R and includes full frontal nudity of all three leads. Sex is portrayed in a naturalistic, mature way, unlike what we usually see in Hollywood movies. Perhaps because of its Brazilian director, Bruno Barreto, its sensibilities are more European than American. To its credit it doesn't go into the preachy moralism about underaged sex or student-teacher sex that such films tend to veer into. Instead it celebrates the rekindling of romance and a second chance at love for two aging people.

Fine Line Home Entertainment has provided a fine DVD transfer in the film's original 1.85:1 aspect ratio (anamorphic). The print is clean and free of damage. Picture quality is excellent. Images are sharp with good contrast. Colors are rich and vibrant. Black levels are well rendered. Sound is available in the original English Dolby 2.0 Stereo, a Dolby 5.1 Surround remix or a DTS 5.1 remix. Optional English and French subtitles are provided. There is an engaging commentary by both director Bruno Barreto and his wife Amy Irving.",1121731200,38,1729,4.880952380952381
797698,4,6304153554,"Honestly I didn't realize Amy Locane was such a bombshell until I watched this movie. And she also gave a very strong performance. Amy Irving did a really great job too. ""Carried Away"" came out in 1996, and I haven't seen in the last 5 years any other movie scene as explicit (and thought provoking at the same time) as the one with Irving and Hopper in the buff -  yes, both of them. In the wrong hands, that kind of shots could have turned this terrific film into a Lolita-style soft porn.",1015200000,13,491,4.279569892473118
797699,3,6304153554,"I expected a poignent character study of the way these people's lives were impacted by the affair between a 47 year old teacher and his 17 year old student.  Amy Irving is magnificent as she battles between her pride and her genuine affection for Hopper's character.  Hopper is astonishing in his dignified, quiet desperation and sudden hopeful passions.  Gary Busey is also remarkable in a role which calls for more restraint and subtlety than he's been allowed before.  But, while the acting was superb, there was something wrong with both the pacing and the plot.  Too much time was spent on the affair and too little on the ramifications.  I wonder if men would find this movie more to their taste than women:  Siskel and Ebert gave it 2 thumbs up...",1000684800,7,754,4.709923664122138
797910,4,6304153554,Great acting cast including newcomer Amy Locane. First time I noticed her.  Quite a little vixon.  Graphic nudity so keep the kids away.,1379289600,,136,4.869565217391305
797911,4,6304153554,"Carried Away is a drama with strong comedic overtones about a young man who attempts to rescue his grandmother from a nursing home in Texas, then hitting the road with her to his home in Los Angeles with his family in hot pursuit.  The nucleus family is somewhat dysfunctional, and the three sons are enjoying marginal success at best with an overbearing father as head of the household.

Although this 2009 film has not been rated, there are moments when good taste is abandoned, and the language becomes occasionally offensive; however, were it not so, then the characters would not be true to form.  If you prefer your movies to be sterile and white washed, then you are free to skip this selection which is filled with quirky characters and off-beat humor.",1371859200,,760,4.742424242424242
797912,4,6304153554,"Always a big fan of Dennis ,Watched all his films,Saw this film on pay tv,never came back on. Good honest film,hope others will enjoy it.",1370217600,,137,4.52
797913,4,6304153554,"After the passing of Dennis Hopper I decided to rewatch some of his best performances and this one really stood out. It is the role of Joseph in this simple but impressive film from 1996. Joseph lives on his mother's farm and teaches in the local school where there are only two classrooms. The other teacher Rosalee, (Amy Irving), is Joseph's best friend and lover and they lead a sweet, uncomplicated existence. Their peaceful life is suddenly interrupted by a sexy, beautiful and precocious seventeen year old girl named Catherine played by Amy Locane. She is the daughter of a newly retired Major, (Gary Busey), who has brought his daughter and his alcoholic wife to the farmlands and away from the temptations of big city life. Catherine is a teenage girl who enjoys starting controversy wherever she goes and this new town is no exception. She finds life to be boring and mundane and enjoys spicing things up by using her youthful sexuality.  She decides to put this energy into seducing Joseph. Joseph is a good man but is facing a mid-life crisis and so he is the perfect target for Catherine's carefree whims and fantasies. The role of Joseph is different from any other role Hopper has undertaken and I we see a whole different side of his acting abilities. This film is beautifully directed by Amy Irving's husband Bruno Barreto. Barreto adds a European flavour to this poignant story of love, desire, betrayal and renewal of one's soul.",1351641600,,1448,4.792
797914,4,6304153554,"I've studied the fiction works of Jim Harrison for roughly 20 years.  I had a life-changing experience seeing him on a Michigan Authors panel at Michigan State while in college in the early 90's.  ""Farmer,"" the work on which this movie is based, is my all time favorite of his novels.  So, you can imagine how thrilled I was to see that it had actually been made into a movie and with such a strong cast...I was, at first, cautiously optimistic.  While as a standalone movie it's very good, looking at it as an interpretation of perhaps my favorite novel ever, it has some flaws... One, the casting of Gary Busey as the Major, and the casting of whoever it is that plays Robert.  I felt that both of these were way off the mark.  But that's the more minor issue...  The most significant issue, IMHO, is the changing of the ending from the novel (which I won't spoil for those who have not read it, but I STRONGLY recommend that you do), as the last few scenes of the book are pivotal in Joseph's coming full circle with his desire to be ""carried away."" (That's not a weak attempt at cliche, that's right out of the last few pages of text of the novel....""I wanted to be carried away...""). The movie also deletes the senior trip to Chicago in the spring of the year removing an entire thematic layer of growth and renewal from the story...

I will never understand why films are made from books and WHY such ridiculous license is taken with the actual story.  It usually ruins both the book AND the movie for me.  Perhaps those who make these movies rely too heavily on the assumption that we have become more a nation of ""watchers"" than ""readers.""

Still a decent flick, obviously.  I'm buying a copy of it so what can I say. :)",1338768000,,1728,4.382445141065831
797915,4,6304153554,"Very well acted by Amy Irving, allowing herself to look drab, and older.  And even more especially by Dennis Hopper, who gave what might be his most restrained performance ever, and creates an unforgettable character in the process.

This is the tale of a mid-western, self confessed 'mediocre farmer and schoolteacher' having an erotic affair with a 17 year old student, and the effect it has on his life, especially his long standing, but now somewhat inert relationship with his fellow teacher.  Thematically it's really about taking risks in life, even bad ones, and how we need those to stay alive.

I like and admire that the film neither fully condemns or approves of anyone or any action. Everything is complex.

Sadly, Amy Locaine as the girl, while stunningly beautiful, isn't at the acting level of her older co-stars, nor is her character written with the same kind of insight and precision, which hurts the overall effect. And some of the writing is a little overly poetic and theatrical.

Still, it's an unique film, dealing with sex, aging, morality, fear and self-image in a far more complex, mature way than most American films,
and for once treats mid-western farm folks as just as complex, intelligent and tortured as their big-city counterparts.",1319414400,,1265,4.971563981042654
797916,5,6304153554,"I rented this movie many years ago and loved it so much I just had to buy it.  It is a timeless classic with Dennis Hopper as a middle aged man that is in love with a woman for six years, yet he cannot commit to marriage.  In his weakest moment, he makes a mistake and has an affair with a high school student of his.  This finely acted movie ( Amy Irving is wonderful, also) examines the male mid life crisis and sometimes the regret that comes with it.  There is a beautiful, poignant nude scene at the end of the movie, that truly explains the frustration Dennis Hopper is going through.  A must see, many times over!",1274400000,5,620,4.176470588235294
797917,3,6304153554,"This starts out as a very sleepy agrarian tale, but quickly gets kinky when Dennis Hopper launches an affair with a 17-year-old student. He sort of ditches his long time girlfriend, the rarely seen Amy Irving, and complications ensue. There's a kind of creepy side plot involving the cancer death of Hopper's old mom. Lots of full frontal nudity, including Hopper and Irving. She, the ex- of Stephen Speillberg, is now married to the director here. I laughed as Hopper, who must be at least 67, claims to be a 47-year-old teacher here, while Irving, who must be in her late 50s, exposes herself. It turns out better than expected, despite the ominous casting of the crazy Gary Busey as the dad of the gorgeous teen bedded by Hopper. Worth watching. Did this ever play in theaters?",1247529600,6,780,4.700729927007299
797918,3,6304153554,"Carried Away is ultimately a cinematic treatise on the dangers of crossing that line no man should ever cross, but a line that so many tiptoe upon either in reality or imagination. Dennis Hopper's character is an aging, bored teacher in a rural farm community. His life is predictable and the only question that still stirs within it is when he exactly intends on marrying his long-time girlfriend (Amy Irving). Things take a sudden change when a new student arrives in town, brining with her a willingness to seduce her teacher, if only to keep herself entertained while living in the new but overwhelmingly drab town. He, although sheepishly at first, falls prey to her advances and within a short period of time, finds his life is complete and total disarray. A solid film, but the gratuitous nudity was a bit forced.",1212019200,4,820,4.78169014084507
