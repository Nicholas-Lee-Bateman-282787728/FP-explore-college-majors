8105577,5,B000E41MOA,"We have here a special holiday movie. ""Special"" because it's absolutely the DARKEST Christmas story you will EVER, EVER see!

Harold Ramis directs neo-noirish THE ICE HARVEST (2005). Cast incudes John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Oliver Platt and Randy Quaid, among others.

Set in Wichita, Kansas, the story opens late on Christmas Eve and unfolds in 12 hours. Cusack is lawyer to gangster/strip club owner Quaid. After much prodding from his potential partner-in-crime Thornton, nice guy Cusack embezzles $2 million from boss Quaid. Thornton acts unconcerned over Cusack's fears that Quaid will quickly find out who stole his cash and retaliate by having them both killed. He tells Cusack to ""act normal,"" an impossibility for the worry wart lawyer.

After Thornton takes charge of their satchel of loot and with plans of them both leaving town for warmer climes right after the holiday, Cusack goes on a world class Xmas Eve bender with best frriend Platt, who's in a deep depression. Platt is unhappily married to Cusack's ex-wife. Real funny stuff happens on their strange night out, as Platt gets so manure-faced he's just conscious enough to mouth off to the wrong people.

Almost immediately however, a thuggish hitman does indeed come looking for the thieves. Cusack gets a message from Thornton that ""You were right"" about the gunman and to meet him at the club (which is now closed). Cusack notices a blood puddle on the floor inside the ominously deserted place. He follows its trail to a back room, where an amputated finger sits in a vise! Terrified, Cusack runs out of there, anticipating the worst. He drives to Thornton's home and is greeted by a ghastly scene...

Oh, I'd better stop.

You'll definitely want to catch this one, even if it's NOT Christmas! Highest recommendation.",1351641600,2,1796,5.010067114093959
