4241805,5,B0041EVYYM,"Finally the perfect Christmas--past, present, future!  A cornucopia of Crosby treasures, but the greatest jewel of all in this rich compilation of Bing's incomparable family specials is the 1971 --disc 2--show starring opera star Mary Costa. Her beauty rivals her heavenly voice, and brings Christmas alive all year round!  Her hilarious medley duet of 'Jingle Bells' with Bing is itself worth the price, a bargain, of the entire set.  Someone once asked Noel Coward what you have to do to be a star.  His answer was one word: 'Sparkle'!  Mary Costa sparkles with enough wattage to light up the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, and the chemistry with Bing is pure magic. God bless the Crosby family for sharing these memorable moments for all time!",1290124800,7,750,5.016129032258065
4241806,5,B0041EVYYM,"This second DVD release from the Bing Crosby Archive has four of Bing's Christmas specials and while I have had poor video versions of these for many years, it's wonderful to have them at last in great quality. In particular, the 1961 special filmed in England is a revelation. Several of my friends were at the filming of this and they have always raved about it. The 1962 show was Bing's first in colour and even if the quality is not as crisp as the 1961 special, it's still much better than I have ever seen before. On disc 2 are Christmas shows from 1971 and 1977 (Bing's last) and these are perfection itself. The bonus items of outtakes from the 1962 show, the Sinatra show from 1957, Bing's Britain and the Toys for Tots PSA are excellent and make this package a very attractive one indeed.

These are great Christmas shows which are bound to bring back some wonderful memories.",1289952000,25,886,4.503105590062112
4241807,5,B0041EVYYM,"I've been oh-so looking forward to this!  These specials always showcased outstanding performances, and for me it's a great trip back to simpler years!  Christmas was never the same without a Bing Crosby Christmas Special.  My favorite (although not on these discs) was the 1973 special because it was filmed on location in real snowy weather, and had all the guests (like Michael Landon) in a real horse-pulled sleigh.  None of these I fully remember as a kid except Bing's final special that featured David Bowie singing that now-famous duet with him, ""The Little Drummer Boy/Peace On Earth"", which is included here.  (I remember how we all commented on Bowie's hair.)  I had seen the highlights show (narrated by Gene Kelly) for most of my life and could not remember seeing any uncut shows on TV after the early eighties.  A few years ago, I bought a copy of the Sinatra holiday team-up (a nice bonus feature included with this) and love it! I am excited to get to share these year after year with my friends and family!  Thank you so much for releasing these!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bing-Crosby-The-Television-Specials-Volume-2-The-Christmas-Specials/dp/B0041EVYYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bing Crosby: The Television Specials Volume 2- The Christmas Specials</a>",1289260800,23,1322,5.641414141414141

4241816,1,B0041EVYYM,"The sound is good the picture quality is good.  Guess the idea of old Bing was better than listening to him and his family.  They sing ok, but this was pretty boring.  The one gem here is a short about 20 film that was a Christmas special Frank Sinatra produced and did with Bing.  The two of them together singing was great.  Also Frank's set was much better.  The show Bing did from London was the best of the Bing bunch, the best ""show"" on here though was Frank Sinatra's.  BUT if YOU really like Bing you will enjoy this.  Oh and there is a film Bing did for the British tourism office so if you like to travel to and in Jolly Old England, you will find this nice too.

Bing also did a 30 minute monologue about all the things he loves about Great Britain. The special featuring David Bowie is a treat, as well as the Robert Goulet special. Overall, a nice compilation.

4241823,3,B0041EVYYM,Disc 1 you would hardly know it was about Christmas except Bing sings at the end of each show.  Disc 2 is what we have come to expect of Bing's Christmas shows.,1354838400,,160,4.0
4241824,5,B0041EVYYM,"Harry Lillis ""Bing"" Crosby died on October 14, 1977, at age 74, less than two months after Elvis Presley died (August 16, 1977; age 42). While Elvis' birthday and death are remembered every year, particularly at five-year intervals, few people remember Crosby today. As the late Rosemary Clooney once wrote, ""Only aficionados remember Bing."" Oddly enough, Bing was one of Elvis' idols and early influences. Whether the two of them actually met, I have no idea; if they did, it was probably in Las Vegas or in Hollywood. John Lennon was also a Crosby fan; Bing's rendition of ""Please"" inspired The Beatles' ""Please Please Me."" And according to Crosby biographer Gary Giddins, Lennon had a jukebox of nothing but Crosby records at The Dakota.

This two-DVD set is the second volume of Bing Crosby television specials, released by his widow Kathryn and Bing Crosby Enterprises, and produced by Robert S. Bader. Four of Bing's Christmas specials are included in this set.

Disc 1 contains two shows that I was too young to remember, so this DVD was my introduction to them. They are not really Christmas shows per se, but Bing sings ""White Christmas"" at the end of both shows, and ""The Little Drummer Boy"" in the second show. The first show, which aired in December 1961 on ABC, was taped in England and features an all-British cast, including Ron Moody, Terry-Thomas, and the gorgeous Shirley Bassey, plus a cameo by British-born Bob Hope (in drag). The second show was Bing's first color special, sponsored by Clairol, and aired on Christmas Eve, 1962, also on ABC; it features Broadway legend Mary Martin, Andr Previn (who was still a jazz musician, not yet a symphony conductor and film composer), and the United Nations Children's Choir. Bonus material on Disc 1 includes a rare episode of ABC's THE FRANK SINATRA SHOW from 1957, entitled ""Happy Holidays With Bing and Frank."" Although normally broadcast in black-and-white, this particular episode was shot in color for showing in theaters, which never materialized. The film was discovered in the Sinatra vaults decades later. Also included are a few outtakes from the 1962 Clairol special, including one Mary Martin number that did not make the final cut.

Disc 2 features two shows from the '70s, which I vaguely remember. The first one, which aired on NBC in December 1971, was titled ""Bing Crosby and the Sounds of Christmas,"" and featured Bing's ""second family,"" his wife Kathryn, sons Harry and Nathaniel, and daughter Mary Frances (who would get her 15 minutes of fame later, in 1980, when she played villain Kristin Shepard, who shot the evil J.R. Ewing, played by the recently deceased Larry Hagman, on DALLAS). Other guests included Robert Goulet, the Mitchell Boys Choir, and a long-forgotten opera singer named Mary Costa. The second special, which was taped five weeks before Bing's death, and which aired on November 30, 1977 on CBS, was titled ""Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas,"" and in addition to the Crosby family, featured Twiggy, Ron Moody, Stanley Baxter, the Trinity Boys Choir, and David Bowie, who performed the legendary ""Peace On Earth/The Little Drummer Boy"" duet with Bing. I hadn't seen this footage in years, and thought that Bing and Bowie were not comfortable together; their banter seemed forced, although they sang the duet very well. Bowie also performs his then-current hit ""Heroes,"" but it seems out of place on a Bing Crosby Christmas special. I'm not sure why Bowie was chosen; perhaps Crosby's kids lobbied for his inclusion, or maybe the ""network suits"" at CBS told Bing, ""You gotta put a rock star on, Bing, so that the kids will watch!"" UPDATE: According to the 2014 PBS documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Masters-Bing-Crosby-Rediscovered/dp/B00NHG1D96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Masters: Bing Crosby - Rediscovered</a>, Bowie balked at singing ""The Little Drummer Boy"" because he hated the song; he agreed to do the special only because his mother was a Crosby fan, so to appease him, the show's musical director wrote the ""Peace On Earth"" counter-melody for Bowie to sing. Bing was VERY comfortable with Twiggy, though. And of course, Bing closes the show, as always, with ""White Christmas""; sadly, it was his last television performance. His final public concert was held at England's Brighton Centre just four days before his death on a golf course in Spain. Oddly enough, his last U.S. concert was held on August 16, 1977 - the same day that Elvis passed away.

Bonus material on Disc 2 includes a 1965 Toys for Tots PSA, filmed on the set of Bing's movie ""Stagecoach,"" and a 1976 tourism travelogue, ""Bing's Britain."" Picture and sound quality are as good as it gets; the Crosby estate did a marvelous job storing and restoring these shows, which is no surprise, as Bing invested in cutting-edge technology firms (e.g., the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) Company) throughout his life.

If Bing Crosby were still alive, and making Christmas (or non-Christmas) specials today, who would he be performing with? I'm sure he would had loved working with Diana Krall, Michael Bubl (who has used archival Crosby footage in all of his NBC Christmas specials to date), Kristin Chenoweth, Natalie Cole (Bing was a close friend of her dad's), country stars such as Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Martina McBride, and Carrie Underwood, Mariah Carey, or maybe even Lady Gaga (now that, thanks to Tony Bennett, she has reinvented herself as a jazz singer). But Bing with Beyonc, Chris Brown, Rihanna, Jay-Z, Katy Perry, Kanye West, Miley Cyrus, or the cast from GLEE? Not on your life.

Now that David Bowie has passed on (January 10, 2016), will he and Bing duet again in Heaven?

I hope that the Crosby estate makes more specials available, if demand warrants it.",1354665600,2,5828,5.089958158995816
4241825,5,B0041EVYYM,"I have been yearning to see Christmas variety type shows from the past and was happy to find this.

4241826,4,B0041EVYYM,"The comic segments are pretty lame by  today's standards, but the singing is well worth it.

4241828,5,B0041EVYYM,"A great trip down memory lane; some of the specials were before my time so I'd never seen them.  The final Christmas special shot just prior to Bing Crosby's death features an icon and now famous rendition of 'Little Drummer Boy' with pop artist David Bowie.  Up until the last Bing Crosby was an entertainer, a legend.  This is a great, well edited collection and hope to see more in the future.",1351036800,,396,4.472222222222222
4241829,5,B0041EVYYM,"These are great variety shows which probably can be seen better than when first broadcast. A particular treat for me was seeing Shirley Bassey in 1961 from London. Shirley sings This Is My Lucky Day, and As I Love You. She is fabulous !  Probably one of the earliest Shirley Bassey appearances available on DVD.",1341792000,,311,4.654545454545454

4241831,2,B0041EVYYM,"We were really looking forward to watching this Christmas eve but what a bore.  We did not finish watching either disc.  The first black and white disc had no stage presence just Bing standing there singing and he was no spring chicken at the time.  Then he had his London apppearance and that wasn't any better.  He traveled around London with skits that were frankly stupid.  Then we tried to watch the second disc in color with Mary Martin and that was a little better.  You would not know that this was a Christmas special until about 45 min. into the disc when there was finally a Christmas song.  No pretty stage sets, nothing!  What a waste of money.",1324771200,2,657,4.46218487394958
4241832,2,B0041EVYYM,Are you kidding?  Bing Crosby must have done better stuff than this!!!!  The first DVD was incredibly boring...took place in England...black & white...2nd DVD finally had some rather entertaining Christmas footage in color...but slow moving & not up to the par that I remember from the old days!!! I'm a senior citizen...loves the old performers & movies...but this definitely was not worth my money!!!  The cover of this DVD promises more than it delivers!!!,1323475200,4,459,5.175675675675675

4241835,5,B0041EVYYM,"This is a delightful collection.  To me the highlight is the 1962 Clairol show with Mary Martin.  There just isn't enough on DVD of this superb, legendary entertainer.  And the bonus tracks or out takes just happen to contain one song ""Nearer"" by Rodgers and Hart, that wasn't part of the original telecast!  And this lovely rendition of the song by Mary Martin is worth the entire price of the DVD (which is quite a bargain as it also has a bonus cd)

I loved this collection.  Bing Crosby and Mary Martin had an historic collaboration throughout the years, and Bing is at his wonderful best in all the programs contained in this wonderful set.

I will be playing this one a lot!  Enjoy!",1297036800,3,688,4.491935483870968

4241837,3,B0041EVYYM,"I found the Bing Crosby Christmas Specials to be a great ""blast from the past"" experience. The picture quality was good and getting to see Bings's guest stars, including Mary Martin and Robert Goulet, was an added bonus.  The first of the four specials was not really Christmas-themed at all but was very entertaining nonetheless.  Filmed in black and white in 1961, the fact that it was NOT in color brought its own nostalgic appeal.

The other three specials were in color and all seemed to ""wear"" pretty well over time.  The third special had a strictly Christmas theme and was quite enjoyable with Bing's family joining in.  The last special though, was priceless with great English sets, a fine cast and an unforgetable song duet between Bing and David Bowie.

The only downside was the price.  $17.95 seemed a little steep for less than four hours of T.V. re-runs.  If this product were priced at $9.95 rather than $17.95 it would have been a better value.  Nevertheless, for nostalgia fans, for those who can't get enough of Christmas, and for Bing Crosby lovers this collection was a real Christmas gift worth experiencing!",1295654400,9,1131,4.818652849740933
4241838,5,B0041EVYYM,"As noted jazz critic Gary Giddins makes manifestly clear in the very first chapter of his definitive biography of the first half of Crosby's career (""Pocketfull of Miracles,"" 2003), Bing Crosby was not only one of the most important and influential entertainers of the 20th century but inarguably (as the numbers show--from his hit recordings to his multi-decade appeal at the box office--including an Oscar for best actor--and of course his weekly radio show, which had an uninterrupted run of over 30 years) the most successful entertainer of them all.  He, more than any other single artist-musician-actor-celebrity, was for most Americans ""Mr. Everyman,"" as shown even by small details like the American General who, upon receiving the official document of surrender from the Imperial representative of Japan on the Battleship Missouri, exclaimed: ""Now this would be an absolutely perfect moment if Bing Crosby were here to sing for us.""

Consequently, any remastered, out-of-print, or new Crosby material is something worth celebrating for any fan of ""Der Bingle.""  Admittedly, it's certainly no substitute for complete box sets like ""Bing: His Legendary Years"" or ""Bing Crosby: It's Easy to Remember.""  And for the youngster who is relatively (perhaps entirely) unfamiliar with Crosby, a better introduction to his breadth and genius might be a single-disc anthology like ""Bing's Gold Records"" or ""The Definitive Collection.""  As Giddins himself acknowledges, the 25th anniversary of Elvis' death was marked by no end of tributes, memorials, and highly publicized retrospectives of every kind whereas the memory of Crosby's passing during the same year  (1977) was treated as a comparative footnote.

A slightly stocky man of medium build, with a receding hairline and a preference for sweaters, pipes and playing golf over ""faster"" action, Crosby was in many respects an unlikely star.  Yet he was an absolutely dominating force--and in all the media.  Despite his modest and self-effacing, ""aw shucks"" manner (he even insisted that if people liked him it was because, while singing in the shower, they could imagine themselves to be as good as Crosby--and, he added, they probably were).  But Bing's art was no less towering for being so deceptively ""laid back"" (that overused term that's found a permanent residence in American consciousness).  He was a master musician whose personal rise is inseparable from the rise of American popular song as an indigenous art form with roots as much in African-American music and jazz as in European music halls.  He transformed singing from vaudevillian sport (before Crosby's mastery of the microphone, the megaphone along with a set of leather lungs were practically mandatory to any aspiring vocalist) to the ""people's music.""  But to those who study the recordings, it was also a rare, even sophisticated art (his early '30s melodramatic style deserves as much attentive listening as his Armstrong-inspired jazz singing).  He was the first to truly ""interpret"" lyrics, adding appropriate ""swells,"" ""mordants, and ""trills"" for dramatic emphasis. He was an expert at improvisation, including ""scatting"" and ""whistling""--and perhaps above all he was a master of the language.  Going through the massive amount of Crosby material--hit recordings, radio shows, interviews, film roles--I can't recall a single moment when he so much as hesitates for the ""right"" word let alone flubs a line.  While many of us struggle with words, Crosby was, seemingly without fail, the American Shakespeare--fully, unremittingly, and always tastefully and appropriately in control of the American vernacular.  Yet we saw him not as a remote celebrity or ""higher"" figure but as one of us.

The lip-synching, referred to by a couple of other reviewers, certainly had nothing to do with Crosby's own abilities but with technology, or improved audio.  As for the Bob Hope sketch that some viewers find disappointing, feel free to breeze by it in favor of one of the boys' ""Road"" pictures.  (Watching ""Road to Bali"" recently I could scarcely believe how fast-moving, inventive, down-right ""hip"" the movie was--perhaps unfortunate for some viewers because picking up on the flow of jokes, contemporary allusions, and even ""post-modern"" self-referential business (to the movie camera and the artifice of cinema itself) can be a bit of a challenge for anyone ""not in the know"").  Finally, the relationship between Sinatra and Crosby is frequently a source of utter fascination and delight.  At times, the rivalry between the two, with Crosby as the ""old groaner"" and Sinatra as the ""skinny crooner,"" is so palpable it can seem as genuinely felt as it is good-natured, especially on their radio broadcasts in the '40s.  While those are not included in the present collection, a thoroughly delightful, recently remastered and released mid-50s Christmas television show (in color!) starring Frank with Bing as the featured guest is perhaps the highlight of this collection (the Crosby-David Bowie duet--filmed for television just prior to Bing's passing--is perhaps familiar enough not to require further commentary).

If this collection seems a bit rich for you, definitely check out the separate DVD edition of ""Happy Holidays with Bing and Frank.""  Others have commented on the show's ""impressive production values,"" but what might strike some viewers as extraordinary is the spareness of the set, the lack of gimmickry, the exclusive focus on nothing but the singing of the pair. Even though I'm a Sinatra-ophile, I'm not so infatuated as to be incapable of appreciating the moments when the advantage--in poise, grace, assuredness--is Bing's.  This, like the ""Did You Evah?"" number in ""High Society,"" is one such moment.",1294358400,,5745,5.341463414634147
4241839,5,B0041EVYYM,"A wonderful collection for those old enough to remember when the words 'Christmas' and 'Bing Crosby' were inseparable, these specials from the 50s-70s are also an interesting retrospective on television from that period.  Crosby always had the best guest stars (Mary Martin is a standout) and musical arrangers and conductors (Andre Previn appears in an early special).  The last Crosby special, 'Bing Crosby in Merry Olde England,' aired after his death in 1977 and was one of the best, featuring the iconic duet with David Bowie.  One of the great bonus features is a Frank Sinatra Christmas special, directed by Sinatra and featuring Bing as the sole guest.  Watching these two 20th-century masters work together is holiday magic.",1293408000,4,733,5.186440677966102
4241840,5,B0041EVYYM,"Bing's holiday specials were a must see for me and my family growing up, his shows put you into the holiday spirit.  Of course hearing him sing White Christmas at the closing of each show was the best.  It is great to see them restored and the quality is great, menu selections are awsome so you can jump right to a specific song or performance.  My all time favorite piece in this double dvd set is the duet with David Bowie from his 1977 England Christmas show.  A must have for the generation who grew up with these specials.",1293321600,2,528,4.303030303030303
4241841,4,B0041EVYYM,"Much of Bing Crosby's brilliant musical accomplishments, have been overshadowed by his association with Christmas, many young people nowadays, if they know of him at all, just think he's the old guy who sang 'White Christmas', they are totally unaware he remains one of the greatest jazz and swing style singers ever, and virtually created 'Pop' music single handedly! Bing Crosby-The Television Christmas Specials, won't do much to change this view, but there's no denying, no other singer comes anywhere near to Bing, in being called 'Mr. Christmas'! Mind you, only 2 of the 4 specials presented here can be classed as truly 'Christmasy', the best being 'Bing Crosby and the Sounds of Christmas', featuring Robert Goulet and Mary Costa, with a 68 year old Bing, still looking and sounding admirable! The others are a mish mash of good and bad, the good, usually being Bing himself, the bad, often being too many others getting involved, and not enough of what after all, most people want to see, Bing singing! Still, they are all worthwhile as a part of musical history, and they feature the man who was the grand daddy of them all, when it comes to 'Pop' megastars! As far as I'm concerned, the more Bing on DVD, the better!
P.S. The bonus CD that comes with this set, features some of the lesser known takes of Bing Christmas songs, including what could arguably be the best ever version of 'White Christmas', with Ella Fitzgerald?",1293235200,,1435,4.813765182186235
4241842,5,B0041EVYYM,"These Christmas special demonstate why the TV variety show is now dead. There's way too much filler, and much of the material is somewhat boring to watch. I enjoyed David Bowie right from the first viewing; he's the reason I bought this set.

Mary Martin was a different story, at first it seemed like a Mary Martin special, not Bing Crosby. On second viewing, I realized why Crosby gave her so much airtime. Martin was a very good comic and singer, but not in your face like Ethel Merman. More subtle, which may turn people off. If you give Martin a chance, you will be surprised at the range of her talent.

I enjoyed Crosby's wife and children, who show up in the last two specials, the only ones that are truly all about Christmas. They are not particularly talented, but they help humanize Crosby, who seems to be just going through the motions on ocasion.

There's a lot to like here, but if you watch the four special just once, you will miss a lot.",1292112000,3,956,4.420454545454546
4241843,3,B0041EVYYM,"As excited as I was with the first release of Crosby television specials, that's just about how disappointed I was with this release.  Disc 1 I suffered through...literally.  The British show was, in my view, a bore with extremely poor production values, despite dating to 1961.  Even the sketch with Bob Hope was disappointing.  The Clairol special (1962) was great IF you like Mary Martin; if not, you'll be disappointed.  ""Happy Holidays With Frank & Bing"" (1957) was the highlight of the first disc.  It's an odd show, but entertaining and just plain interesting in its concept.  Production values were excellent, especially considering it was in color way back then.  It's been out on DVD before, but this makes the whole set worthwhile.  I saw nothing entertaining about the outakes, but the extra features on disc 2 are more interesting - a Toys For Tots PSA and Bing's push for British tourism).

Disc 2 gets off to a better start.  The 1971 special is very nicely done - exceptionally beautiful sets and wonderful musical arrangements by Perry Como's arranger Nick Perito.  Robert Goulet does a decent job, the Crosby duet with opera singer Mary Costa is entertaining, and the Crosby family all mix together well to make this the kind of Crosby Christmas special we all remember.  The 1977 British Christmas special - taped just a few months before his death - and broadcast posthumously - is interesting, although a bit more so to the Brits, since all the guests are British stars, many of whom aren't that familiar to American audiences.  The concept is unique and we get to see the Crosby children for the last time.  No question, Bing is old here, but he seems rather sprite at the age of 74, and in decent voice.  I've never been a fan of the over-rated Crosby/David Bowie duet, but watching it this time I wondered how Bowie thinks of it now that he's approaching old age himself (currently 63); the Bowie solo in the special seems totally out of place.  And, too bad that the lip-syncing is so obvious in many spots on all the Crosby specials.

In sum, looking back, Como did Christmas better, but there's no denying that hearing and seeing Bing Crosby sing ""White Christmas"" is something truly special and not to be missed for the holidays.",1291766400,5,2257,4.728900255754476
4241844,5,B0041EVYYM,"Earlier this year Infinity Home Video released a terrific 2-DVD set of Crosby TV specials. The source material came from the Bing Crosby Archive, managed by Crosby's widow Kathryn. Not only were the performances great (and the bonus too!) but the images - especially the black and white ones - were sharp and crisp.

Now, in time for the ""holiday"" season comes Volume 2 - ""The Christmas Specials"". Its almost as good. Don't be put off by the restricted title ""Christmas"". The first two of the four complete hour-long shows here only have a Christmas song at the end and you can watch any time of the year without even knowing it was a Christmas Special. The first - from 1961- is in crisp black and white and was recorded in England. Though this looks better than the second show on Disc One, it is weaker because a lot of time was devoted to comedy sketches to the exclusion of Bing's singing, and the guests are little-known British actors or comedians like Dave King, Miriam Karlin and Ron Moody. The second show - in color - is a full of song with Mary Martin as guest. The color image is not as sharp - with some dropouts - but at least we have it preserved. The second disc takes us to the ""family"" years when Kathryn and Bing's sons would appear,. And for the second show on that disc - the 1977 special recorded just five weeks before Crosby died - we are back in England with Bing dueting with Twiggy and the ""classic moment"" in which Bing sings ""The Little Drummer Boy"" with David Bowie, a clip that probably gets a few million hits on Youtube every year.

The bonus features are also well chosen. The 1957 Happy Holidays With Bing And Frank is 30 minutes of the two of them singing in an ABC show directed by Sinatra. There are outtakes from the Crosby/Martin 1962 show noted above. And while Bing was in Britain in 1976 he did a promo film for British tourism that is worth seeing.

These DVD sets come with a nice little liner note booklet and are well packaged. I, for one, will anxiously await the next in this series from Infinity. But, for now, its nice to relive these holiday specials - which I remember fondly - again.

4241845,5,B0041EVYYM,"Finally the perfect Christmas--past, present, future! A cornucopia of Crosby treasures, but the greatest jewel of all in this rich compilation of Bing's incomparable family specials is the 1971 'Sounds of Christmas' show starring opera star Mary Costa. Her beauty rivals her heavenly voice, and brings Christmas alive all year round! Her hilarious medley duet of 'Jingle Bells' with Bing is itself worth the price, a bargain, of the entire set. Someone once asked Noel Coward what you have to do to be a star. His answer was one word: 'Sparkle'! Mary Costa sparkles with enough wattage to light up the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, and the chemistry with Bing is pure magic. God bless the Crosby family for sharing these memorable moments for all time!",1290297600,6,757,5.015873015873016
4241846,5,B0041EVYYM,"If you're a baby boomer you likely grew up watching Bing Crosby on television at least once a year, in his annual and much anticipated Christmas specials. They may have even been the only things you knew him for, if you were too young to remember the astonishing career that preceded those festive end-of-year broadcasts. Bing's holiday shows with his family, which began in the 1960s when he hosted the Hollywood Palace's (ABC's answer to the Ed Sullivan Show) Christmas programs, and continued into the 1970s when he and his family starred in their own Christmas specials, were practically an institution back in the 3-channel, pre-cable days. If you were born prior to the Second World War you likely remember Bing as the most beloved entertainer of the 20th century, with the TV Christmas shows serving as an endearing coda to a legendary performer's long career. In either case, this set of four vintage Crosby specials (plus a bonus show, outtakes and TV spots), not seen in more than three decades, should be a warm and welcome sight to your world weary eyes. This is ""comfort television"" of the highest order.

Bing's first two holiday TV specials--which weren't entirely devoted to a Christmas theme--comprise the first of the two discs. 1961's ""Bing Crosby Show,"" which was filmed in England and aired on December 11th, features Terry-Thomas and Shirley Bassey, with a surprise appearance by one of Bing's old buddies. ""The Bing Crosby Show for Clairol,"" from December 24th, 1962, was Bing's first color special, and his guests are broadway star (and two-time movie co-star with Bing) Mary Martin and pianist-conductor-composer Andr Previn. Filling out disc 1 are outtakes from the Clairol Special and the half-hour ""Happy Holidays with Bing and Frank"" (Dec. 20, 1957), in which Frank Sinatra shares a ""toddy for the body"" with guest Bing, in Frank's faux late-`50s swingin' bachelor pad.

Disc two features a pair of the best of Bing's 1970s Christmas shows with his wife Kathryn and children Harry, Mary Frances and Nathaniel. The first, ""Bing Crosby and the Sounds of Christmas"" (December 14, 1971), is truly a feast for the eyes and ears, and a rare example of just how appealing that oft-denigrated genre, the variety show, could be, with bravura comedy and musical performances by Robert Goulet and Mary Costa, and sublime caroling by the Mitchell Singing Boys choir. Finally, perhaps the best-remembered and most beloved Christmas special of them all, ""Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas,"" taped just weeks before Bing's death and aired posthumously on November 30, 1977, closes out this delightful set. Shot in England, it of course features Bing's now legendary--but at the time surprising and anomalous--duet with David Bowie, ""Little Drummer Boy""/""Peace on Earth,"" as well as engaging performances by supermodel pioneer Twiggy, Brit comedians Stanley Baxter and Ron Moody, and The Trinity Boys Choir.

Produced by veteran DVD maven Robert S. Bader (""The Dick Cavett Show - Hollywood Greats,"" ""Groucho Marx: You Bet Your Life - The Best Episodes""), the visual and audio quality of these 33- to 53-year-old shows has been beautifully restored. In fact, they look and sound better than they did when they first aired--whether your television set had rabbit ears or a rooftop antenna!",1290211200,53,3302,5.111111111111111

Accompanying the deluxe edition is a wonderful 10-track bonus CD containing holiday songs from Bing's 1950's radio shows. He was in tremendous voice on all of these tracks, to the point on some that one wonders if they might even be superior to the ""official"" recordings made for commercial release. One such track is a magnificent rendition of ""White Christmas,"" in which Bing trades lines with the legendary Ella Fitzgerald.

8412716,4,B0041EVYYM,"It's hard not to give this four stars because it's really a grand collection, straight from the archives, presented beautifully. Two discs with four entire specials, loads of extras (most notably the entirety of the ""Happy Holidays With Bing and Frank"" special, but I'll address that later), the best quality that can be imagined.

If you're a Bing Crosby fan, it's a must buy.

However, if you're like me and like Crosby only in the context of Christmas, and are looking for a holiday special--look somewhere else; I'd suggest Questar's ""A Bing Crosby Christmas."" Why? None of the four specials presented here are the best examples of CHRISTMAS specials.

Included are Crosby's very first special--interesting presentation for TV historians for sure, but it has absolutely nothing to do with Christmas except for the closing number, ""White Christmas."" His second special, from 1962, has little more to offer in that regard.

I would say that the third presentation here, from 1971, probably is the most ""Christmasy,"" but even it deviates significantly in portions. And while the last, Bing's final special (presented posthumously in its original run in 1977), is a curiosity piece because of its inclusion of David Bowie, it too hardly feels like Christmas, at least not Christmas Americana. It takes more than a few carols Scotch-taped together to get us there. This is a much ""smaller"" special than the others and it had all sorts of unrealized potential from a holiday standpoint. And while the duet between Bing and Bowie is one of the greatest moments in TV history, the Bowie solo act thrown into the middle is nonsensical and bizarre. It's not the only bizarre moment from this one--two ghosts show up, one of them doing a Bob Hope impersonation. Uhhhh...what?

Overall I was pretty mightily disappointed and would like to have seen some of the specials from the mid '70s which, from what I can tell, were more focused on the holiday rather than oblique storytelling.

Easily the most fulfilling part of this collection from this point of view is the included bonus ""Happy Holidays With Bing and Frank,"" a color presentation of a Frank Sinatra show (Crosby was the guest) from 1957. It's Christmas to the core. But this has been available on DVD for years by itself,  with loads of extras including a commentary from the producers. So I definitely wouldn't suggest buying this collection to get that.

I can't knock this collection too much because the hard-core fans will love it, and it really is well done. It  just doesn't suit my particular tastes.",1386288000,,2561,4.937209302325582
