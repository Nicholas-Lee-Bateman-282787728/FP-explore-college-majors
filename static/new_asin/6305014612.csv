7881719,4,6305014612,"This series was made in the mid-90s and I remember watching it around the millenium on some local stations that no longer show such stuff. It's mostly set in a ""spa"" where both clients and service providers can live out fantasies. Despite only average lighting, the episodes still look fairly good, with some nice female figures and, I suppose, male ones. The music (by the un-erotic sounding Herman Beeftink) sets an appropriate mood to the action that, being soft-core, depends on touching as much as thrusting, thus enhancing an appeal that would be less so with anything stronger.",1323648000,,584,4.969387755102041
