7842937,2,6303308260,"CRYING FREEMAN 4: A TASTE OF REVENGE is a Japanese animated adaptation of the graphic novel of the same title in the popular Crying Freeman manga series written by Kazuo Koike and drawn by Ryoichi Ikegami. It's the fourth in the anime series and represents a significant drop-off in animation quality from the others. The story is an interesting one and deals with an aging Japanese cult leader's attempt to take over the 108 Dragons, a Hong Kong-based assassins' organization headed by the title character, Crying Freeman. However, the animators work too hard to duplicate the look of the manga and have simply transferred static drawings to the screen without investing them with the cinematic values of editing, lighting, color and staging that were so evident in the first anime volume, CRYING FREEMAN: PORTRAIT OF A KILLER. The character design, for instance, is riddled with cross-shading, an archaic comic book convention that's completely out-of-place here and serves to prevent much movement on the part of the characters. It also makes the more attractive characters, particularly Freeman and his Yakuza moll sex partner, Kimie, considerably less so.
The story is somewhat simplified from that of the manga so as to fit into a compact 50 minutes and follows the efforts of cult leader Naitai and his partners, Yakuza widow Kimie, wrestling giant Oshu Togoku, and corrupt Inspector Nitta, to place a double of Crying Freeman, the Japanese sculptor-turned-head of the 108 Dragons, within the leadership of the 108. After they capture Freeman, part of the training and programming process is to videotape a drugged Freeman having frequent, unrestrained sex with Kimie so that the double can duplicate his moves in bed. Because of the limited animation and awkward design, the erotic charge of these scenes, which leaps off the pages of the manga, is just not as evident on screen. If one is a devoted fan of the Crying Freeman series, it's all still worth watching, especially in conjunction with a reading of the graphic novel, but the execution is a far cry from that of the other Crying Freeman anime volumes, especially nos. 1, 2, and 5.",1029888000,2,2148,5.019607843137255
