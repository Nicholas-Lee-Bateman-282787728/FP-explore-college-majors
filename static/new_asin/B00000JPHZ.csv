Mafia vs Ninja stands stands as one of the best of the worst.
You won't be disappointed, unless you're planning on using this movie as a training tool so you can fight better.
Just get a copy and enjoy the ride.",1085443200,,331,4.1875
8079724,5,B00000JPHZ,"This is hands-down the funniest movie I have ever seen.  All of my friends and I, including ANYONE I have ever shown this movie to, loves it to death!  Ever since we discovered it back in 1995, I've probably watch it, no joke, about 30 times.  Not only is the fighting awesome and absolutely hilarious, but the dubbing is the real prize!  My friends and I still quote lines from the movie today.  So many hilarious quotations, ranging from ""My friend, what are you doing?.....You wanna know!? I'ma kill yah yah bastard!!"" right down to ""Oh no, they're worth....50 thousand!!"".  And don't even mention the forest scene fight.  I wish I could forget everything about it, just so I could watch it again and laugh as hard as I did the very first time I witnessed its hilarious flying ninjas and infinite 360 spinnings.  You will NOT be sorry if you purchase this film! If anybody knows of a martial arts movie that is equally as funny as Mafia vs.(...)",1082678400,,948,4.535294117647059
8079725,5,B00000JPHZ,"How to sum up this film? In a word: brilliant. Quite possibly the most influential movie ever made. Every actor from now, until the end of time, owes their due to Jack Doe. Filled with rip-roaring action scenes that include such memorable scenes in which piles of grass turn into ninjas, dummies fly around the woods of China and quite possibly the greatest chase scene ever filmed (in which our hero Jack Doe chases down his foes on a Schwinn). A MUST OWN for the following: druken frat boys, lonely high school students, those practicing the martial arts, and those aspiring to become the next great filmmaker. Ok, thats enough...seriously, this is the funniest movie I have ever seen. You will laugh til you puke and then laugh some more. Make sure to have your buddies and a couple of cases of brew handy for this one. Hey, how can you not love a movie that has a samurai warrior brandishing a Hitler-style mustache????? Buy this now!!
P.S. Serious props to the movie nerds (like myself) that identified music from the films ""Tron,"" ""Krull,"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" on this soundtrack.",1032912000,4,1092,4.752631578947368
8079726,5,B00000JPHZ,"Yeah, that is probably what you will think when you hear the title to this film, but trust me, this is a true classic.  The fighting is awesome, and the dialougue is the most memorable in history.  never have i come across a movie that so well applies itself to my circle of friends like this one.  when i was first introduced, i wasn't sure, but am i glad i kept an open mind!  i saw it 4 years ago, and we all still quote the movie and re-enact many of the better scenes all the time.  What other movie inspires young lads to get in fights at school, at work, in streets, and in their homes as much as this?  This is a true masterpiece and definetly one of the greatest movies ever for a bunch of guys to watch late at night with a ton of candy and pizza....END",985824000,4,763,4.0198675496688745

It is up to the heroic duo, Jack Doe and Charlie Woo to stop the band of evil international assasins who work for the Japanese. Non stop action, powerful fight scenes, and some of the most awesome characters you will ever see. Mimo, Fuji, Mimo and Jackson! Epic and inspiring, you will never see martial arts movies in the same way! I also recommend: Shaolin vs Lama, Ninja Hunter, Jade Dagger Ninja or any Thomas Tang masterpiece.",984268800,4,520,4.602150537634409
8079728,5,B00000JPHZ,"...That if Mafia vs. Ninja could be any animal, it would be an 800-pound Mountain Gorilla that eats the likes of Jackie Chan and Jet Li for breakfast.  You want action?  This movie makes Remo Williams look like  Driving Miss Daisy.  You want over-dubbing that will make you lose your  mind?  Look no further.  The first time I saw this movie I had no idea what  I was getting into, but after viewing it once I immediately rewound it and  watched it again.  I would recommend this for friends and enemies alike.  If you like the films of Tomas Tang, or simply enjoy cinema so bad it's  good you need to check this out.

8079729,5,B00000JPHZ,"This movie is the most awesome ninja movie that exists. It may not be as fancy as some of the newer ones but it has great fight scenes, including flying ninjas (I think they are only supposed to be jumping though), ninjas  who can change forms, and some great suspender snapping. It is dubbed but  not all of the emotions are lost. Great story of the Japanese ninjas  fighting the Chinese mafia. This is definitely a must see.",948412800,6,426,4.435897435897436
8079730,1,B00000JPHZ,"This movie had my friends and I cracking up for hours.  For the first 15 minutes, the fights are fairly well done, and the dubbing is decent, but after that, the movie just falls apart.  You can see the strings holding up  the fighters in some places, and some of the fights look more like  synchronized dances.  The plot isn't very clear until you've seen the movie  more than once, and it's not very important.  As it turns out, the Mafia  are the good guys--you see, they only allow prostitution and gambling in  Shanghai, no drugs.  Definitely watch this movie if you want to see some  hilarious, surreal fighting.",945388800,,618,4.577981651376147
8079731,1,B00000JPHZ,"Probably the worst ninja movie ever made.  Awful dubbing, terrible special effects and a story line that seems like it jumped from the pen of a 3rd grader (or should I say crayon).  Mafia movies are great.  Ninja movies are  great.  Mixing the two together is a mistake.  I like beer and milk, but I  wouldn't drink them together.",943747200,,330,4.491525423728813
