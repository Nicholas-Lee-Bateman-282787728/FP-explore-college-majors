4489116,5,B004WSA47U,"Full disclosure: I love The Twelve Kingdoms and already own the complete DVD set.

This first set comes with the the beginning 15 episodes of the Twelve Kingdoms and perfectly end the first arc of the story, so if this is your first time watching the show it's a perfect introduction.  Concerning the show, I personally love the Chinese themes from its beautiful scores to Chinese mythology on kingship that govern the fantasy world Youko enters.  The blu-ray set has 5.1 audio and each disc (3 in the set) comes with a small bit of extra content.  For instant comparison to the DVD release just watch the text-less opening (which is DVD quality) first, then begin to watch the show and wonder over the richness of the color and crispness of picture.

For a fan like me this was an immediate buy just as every subsequent blu-ray volume to come.  However if you have yet to see this show, as someone who has watched hundreds of anime, few rival the Twelve Kingdoms for the content, attention to detail, and sheer complexity of the world.  This is a show you can watch multiple times and still learn something new.  A word of caution though, there are many terms for characters or sections of the world that aren't immediately explained, just trust that all the answers will come and the viewers confusion or wonder is meant to mirror Youko's as she ventures into this very different, but very relatable world. I hope you will enjoy this show as much as I have.",1318204800,10,1459,4.584615384615384
4489117,5,B004WSA47U,"This is an amazing anime that I would recommend to anyone.  I already own this whole series on DVD (the original 10 individual DVD releases), but I love it so much I decided to buy it on blu-ray too.  The picture and sound quality of this blu-ray release is great, so I do plan to buy the rest of the blu-ray releases for this series.  I have only ever watched this series in Japanese with English subtitles (I watched this blu-ray release in Japanese DTS-HD 5.1 with English subtitles), so I cannot say what the English dub version is like.  This release contains the first 14 episodes on 3 discs (there are 45 episodes total in this series), textless opening and closing, and pilot film.  I know this product review is short, but I hope it helps anyone thinking of buying it!",1316304000,24,777,4.443661971830986
4489118,5,B004WSA47U,"Be the first to own this in HD as an amazing story unfolds towards the destiny of a young school girl who will face many trials and challenges to be one day be known as the rightful ruler of a land corrupted by the years of emptiness at at the royal palace whom she is forced to take on the throne without even knowing the most basic things about life and her kingdom. The beautiful storytelling and the implacable quality of the actors are showing us many lessons of life that are learned as the story unravels itself and the girl becomes a woman of great character.

Out of a thousand anime series watched, this one has come through as the very best of  its genre! It is on the same level of quality as Macross Frontier, Chrono Crusade and Heroic Age.

8445672,5,B004WSA47U,"The 1st season of the Twelve Kingdoms is a great collection adder and is a must own (until a full complete blu-ray version comes). If you're a fan of this series, this blu-ray comes highly recommended considering how rare it is to find it and its price for the blu-ray. Video and audio quality are solid and there are some good bonus features that accompany the set. The series itself is fantastic as well and comes highly recommended to really anyone whether they be anime fans or not. It's really difficult to dislike this series since the characters and stories are so well told through its beautiful and exciting narrative.",1486857600,,627,4.709090909090909

8445675,3,B004WSA47U,"While I love this anime so much that I bought this digital version, the quality of the encoding source almost looks like VHS.

The intro titles in the first few seconds make it obvious. ""The Twelve Kingdoms"" and "" NHK"" text flickers.

Reading a review about the Blueray edition&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twelve-Kingdoms-Part-1-Shadow-of-the-Moon-The-Sea-of-Shadow-Blu-ray/dp/B004WSA47U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twelve Kingdoms, Part 1: Shadow of the Moon, The Sea of Shadow [Blu-ray</a>] a reviewer wrote ""The picture and sound quality of this blu-ray release is great"", so I am regretting my digital purchase somewhat.

I REALLY wish the bluray (or even DVD) quality was available for streaming.

I just compared to 2 random non-legit streaming sites. Each had a different source and both had superior source quality. So disappointing.",1463184000,,1013,5.917808219178082

8445677,4,B004WSA47U,Great series. My only problem is that the Japanese audio is 5.1 surround sound. So it sounds really weird coming out of my tv speakers which is only stereo. Same thing with my computer which only has stereo speakers. I don't know why the choice was made to make the Japanese audio playable for only surround sound 5.1. Other than that I have no problems with this.,1412640000,,364,4.447761194029851
8445678,5,B004WSA47U,"It is an incredible product. The story is impressive and the quality of the Blu-ray is superb. One thing you must know before buying it. Because it is an old series, the aspect of the video is 4:3 no 16:9 or 16:10. If that does not bother you (like me) it is a superb addition to your collection. The image quality is incredible and the dub in English is quite good. As a fan of anime, if you haven't bought this series, what are you waiting for do it.",1384560000,2,452,4.089887640449438
8445679,5,B004WSA47U,"If you like fast action, bright colors and cute love stories, don't watch this anime, but this anime has so much more to offer than all that. On the first set (there are two other box sets), the story begins rather slowly and the Protagonist is extremely whinny. The first time I saw this (it was a while ago, I just wanted to get the blu-ray), I almost didn't watch past the first episode; I couldn't stand the protagonist and the back story was just so much to take in while trying to figure out what exactly was going on. It's starts to pick up a storyline around episode 7 and the protagonist stops being so needy.

Needless to say, just have patience and watch the full anime; it's a great story with beautiful music and animation. I can watch it in both English and Japanese and both offer really great voice actors that help to pull your emotions in with the storyline.",1371340800,6,876,4.374233128834356
8445680,4,B004WSA47U,"It's epid yes!!!!!
it's intresting yes!!!!!

it's made for TV's from the 80's yes!!!!
so the screen is not wide screen and NO you cant change it !

Also no english dub, so you have to read and a lot.
this show is a million hours of epic fantasy, very good but very very heavy.",1348185600,,276,4.0
8445681,3,B004WSA47U,"I purchased this anime series because of all of the great reviews and because it seem it could be a great fantasy film. This anime did have all the elements of a great fantasy series with an alternative world of magic, beasts and talking animals. I do believe some people will love this story but I feel the characters and pace of the story can leave some people feeling uninterested.

  The story can move a little slow and  In the beginning the three main characters don't really make sense and can be quite annoying.  The red head cries all the time, the boy hardly say anything, and the other girl is too driven to be part of the world they have been brought to. Not much more insight is given to the character. This makes it truly hard to feel any connection to these characters. Only around episode 10 did I find the main character started to be somewhat interesting.  Without feeling attached to the characters I found the story feels empty. The story seems like It could be really good if only the characters could have been developed better and/or the story's tension could have been increased a little. I mean for a group that is being hunted and attacked by beast you kind of feel that they are just meandering. They don't have any real goal or purpose they are just traveling with no direction or driving force. Without a strong stable character or a fixed goal the story just does not pull you in. Then when the action scenes occur they either skip to the end or if they do show the action its just not that entertaining.  The action scenes could have been a great way pull you through as they developed the story and character but instead the action just falls short.

 Now I have no idea if in the other two part (this is volume 1 of 3 totaling 45 episodes)  if the pace picks up and become more engaging.  I can only comment that the first 14 episode, have not compelled me to continue watching it. Having read some of the book I beleive that the narrative that is not in the anime but was in the book deprives the anime's story of the needing information to understand and therefore connect to the main character.

 All in all I'd say if you don't mind a slower story style and simple characters or if you have read the book this is for you. Everyone else might be disappointed. Rent this if you really want to check this out. If you watch this I'll tell you it is important to know that the main character is someone who want to please everyone yet doesn't really connect with anyone. Knowing that is an important part of the story yet I felt they did not really convey this well enough.",1327968000,2,2605,4.3685300207039335
