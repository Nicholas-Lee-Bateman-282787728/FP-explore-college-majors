8213563,5,B000UKX7KU,"My kids have always loved The Pond.  Christian values in a fun way kids can understand.  Now my older kids are watching them again with their little brother, helping reinforce the lesson of loving your enemies.  I think that's a lesson we all need to remember.",1282953600,,260,4.608695652173913
8213564,4,B000UKX7KU,"These dvds are well done - animation, sound, songs are quite good.  The story lines are pretty good and there is a Christian moral.  The humor in them though is definitely for older children, I would say at least eight years and older.  My children are 3 and 5 and I'm pretty sure they don't get much of what's even going on. I can see how older kids would like it though.",1264982400,,372,4.138888888888889
