8139723,5,B000HGT8N2,"Having lived in Japan since 1979, I haven't always been able to keep up with what's new Stateside. Fortunately, the Internet has enabled me to at least try to keep abreast of the latest on my faves. Still, things do fall between the cracks--case in point, the Old Dogs.

I never heard anything about these artists getting together to record and tour, so it was a pleasant surprise to discover their CDs on a store shelf (and only one of the stores I frequent in Tokyo had them). They had gone their separate ways by then and Waylon Jennings and Jerry Reed passed away in subsequent years, so I knew there would never be a reunion.

I never even dreamed of being able to find any visual traces of the group, so I was delighted to find this video listed on Amazon! It's not a concert video, but rather a charming tableside session of reminiscences, jokes, impromptu singing (with mutual prompts to aid failing memories), and--best of all--a brief cameo by Uncle Shelby himself.

I understand this is now available on YouTube, but don't have a single regret about having purchased the videotape.",1373414400,,1092,4.647668393782383
