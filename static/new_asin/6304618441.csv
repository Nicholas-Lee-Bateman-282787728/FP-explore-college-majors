8215885,4,6304618441,"Sherlock Holmes: Secret Weapon & The Woman in Green

This set contains two movies that were adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyles stories. They have lessons as part of their entertainment. Doyle was interested in criminology and used true crimes as inspiration for these stories. Human nature (greed) continues. These movies are not copies of the original stories, but used parts and adapted them to modern times. They are worth watching as entertainment and about the culture of that era. The original stories are always worth reading, especially when you are older. Read the individual reviews for more information on each movie.

Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon [1942] tells of a plot to steal a bombsight to aid a foreign power. Its four parts are produced in separate factories (as a security measure). Will foreign agents be able to steal this secret weapon? (The Six Napoleons inspired this story.)

Sherlock Holmes and the Woman in Green [1945] tells about the unsolved murders of young women, each had one finger cut off. Holmes wonders what the four victims had in common? He suspects a clever criminal is behind these deaths. Holmes has figured out the scheme, he just needs evidence. He visits Lydia at her home then encounters danger. Can help arrive in time? (Readers of the short stories will recognize the parts in this story.)",1471305600,,1348,4.95575221238938
