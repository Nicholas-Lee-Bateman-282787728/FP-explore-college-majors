8696149,4,B00RWKNAYY,"Resnais  brought us the likes of `Hiroshima Mon Amour' and has collaborated with Alan Aykbourn in the past. Here he takes Aykbourn's very English play - sets it in Yorkshire and does it in French. It is about three couples who are all am dram enthusiasts. They are rehearsing a play and find out that a mutual friend - George - is terminally ill and has only mere months to live.

They decide the play must go on but they will all rally around for George - whom they all have great affection for. The play unravels the motivations of all the players in a slow reveal that can be amusing and at times stylistically `stagey'. It is also filmed on artificial sets to give the added feeling of being am dram and an actual play which will please or annoy depending on your taste. Thespians will appreciate the homage to the theatre.

The performances were all good, and the story is fine, but I felt it dragged a bit in parts, and it is only 109 minutes long. Still this is a fine swan song for Resnais who we sadly lost after he made this film. He was a marvellous talent of the French film industry and will be very much missed - if you are a fan of his work then I am sure you will not be disappointed in this - his last film.",1433548800,2,1224,4.156118143459915
8696150,3,B00RWKNAYY,"Id heard of director Alain Resnais for years. Discussed as one of the prominent directors of the French new wave movement of the sixties and seventies his film HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR is talked about as one of the great films of all times. The problem is in finding his films to watch. Unless you can find a video rental store or library that will carry such titles you're left with spending an arm and a leg to purchase his films from someone like amazon. To spend that much on something you aren't sure you will enjoy makes it less than likely to happen.

Fortunately I was able to get a copy of his last film, LIFE OF REILLY, to watch. While it wasn't intended as his last film, he passed away shortly after it was finished. So finally I had my chance, a moment to sit back and watch a film by an acclaimed master. In the end while I found the film interesting it wasn't really my cup of tea. My thoughts that there are far too many critics and art film lovers who are pretentious when it comes to foreign or art films wasn't changed much by this film. While I could enjoy it, I also couldn't figure out why those who love these films hold them in such esteem while slamming the works of more popular directors. To each his own.

The movie is basically a play put to film in unusual ways that actually work. Based on the play written by Alan Ayckbourn, a playwright that Resnais adored and collaborated with on more than on occasion, it tells the story of three couples who are all a part of Rileys life. We never see Riley on screen but we come to know him through the tales of his friends.

As the film opens the first couple is rehearsing for a play that they are involved in at a local theater. Kathryn is the wanna be actress of the group who is certain she is the best thing there. Her husband Colin is a doctor who has bad news. He referred their friend Riley to a specialist and lets slip to Kathryn that he has a disease with only months to live. Of course being the gossip she is Kathryn immediately gets on the phone to tell her friend Tamara.

Tamara is married to Jack. One of the three couples involved in the story, Tamara is more often the not the lead in the plays this group puts on. Jack is a successful businessman and Rileys best friend who takes the news harder than the rest. Jack is also a philanderer when it comes to his marriage, something we get the idea his wife is aware of but does nothing about. As Kathryn and Colin head over to rehearse with them we are carried off to the last couple.

Here we have Monica, Rileys wife and soon to be ex. Monica has left Riley months prior and lives with Simeon, a farmer. With no interest in Riley any longer she also finds herself trying to decide just what it is she wants out of life. There are moments during the film when we wonder if she truly loves Simeon and yet others when it is apparent that he provides her with something that Riley never could or did.

The episodes of this film take place in the various gardens of the homes that these couples live in. The fourth location for the action that takes place is Rileys home garden. And Riley? He is an unseen presence in the film, always discussed and never in sight. Resnais uses an interesting technique to get us from one location to the other, showing us filmed footage taken from a moving vehicle out the front window that always ends at a painting of the garden for each location.

He also makes the film more of a play by using stage sets rather than actual film style sets. Rather than doorways and windows we are presented with hanging canvases that are painted with slits in them allowing the actors to come and go. Sets contain furniture to sit on and fake plants but little more. The sets and cinematography are unimportant here. It is the interaction between characters that is important.

The stories that unfold among these various friends makes for an interesting film but in the end is it a fantastic piece that you won't soon forget? My guess is that its doubtful. It will offer and evenings entertainment but its not something that I myself would treasure and pull out to watch over and over again. Does it make me anxious to see more films by Resnais to see how well his earlier work stacks up to his last? Not particularly. Should they show up on some cable station perhaps but this movie didn't make me want to seek any out after I finished watching it.

For those who are fans of the French new wave directors I have little doubt youll want to pick this one up. For those who enjoy French films in particular this one should satisfy. Those who hate subtitles will walk by this one quickly (myself I have no problem with this and don't understand how people can hate a movie in its original language). If you're wondering what a movie like this would play out as then by all means this is a good jumping on piece to watch. While it may be different it is also entertaining. In the end its not bad but for most not something youd seek out.",1431043200,,4988,4.303514376996805
