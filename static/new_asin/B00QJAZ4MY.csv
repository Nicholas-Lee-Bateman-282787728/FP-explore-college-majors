6872166,5,B00QJAZ4MY,"Ask Me Anything raises the bar on teen angst movies to a whole new level. The interaction between Britt Robertson's character and adults in her life is poignant and moving.  The acting by the entire cast is spot-on throughout. Britt Robertson emotes so well that during one scene I was brought to tears. It is disturbing, enlightening and thought provoking. I can't think of any reason not to give it five stars!",1419984000,,412,4.722222222222222
6872167,3,B00QJAZ4MY,"Not the greatest, but not the best. Good enough to take the time to watch it. bit of a warning, regarding sexual activity plenty, but not much to see while is going on, but more times than not, innuendo is there. Martin Sheen, provides more of a cameo appearance, so IF your decision is based because he is in it, then don't. 5 minutes at beginning and 5 minutes at the end, that's about it for Martin Sheen. But the movie does well without him, some funny lines and basically struggles of a teenage girl having just finished high school and making decision IF wants to go straight to college or take some time off, to ""find herself"". Basically she's very promiscuous, so she found herself plenty times thru the movie. Justin Long, also in the film but again is NOT his movie, so don't expect much from him either. Britt Robertson, does a nice acting job with the role and it does passes along a message that without realizing it, things that may have had happened during your earlier life, always comes back to hunt you, unfortunately.",1419897600,3,1036,4.51595744680851
6872168,5,B00QJAZ4MY,"MOVIE REVIEW: ASK ME ANYTHING
  Written and directed by Allison Burnett
More often than not, the film version of a book is inferior to the book itself.  In regard to Ask Me Anything, nothing could be farther from the truth.
Allison Burnetts masterful adaptation of his own novel Undiscovered Gyrl packs a powerful punch. The film version intensifies the experience of reading the book by bringing the viewer to a higher level of excitement -- both emotionally and physically.
The heroine is Katie Kampenfelt who decides to defer college for a year. On suggestion of a teacher, she starts an anonymous blog, which launches her on a journey of self-discovery.
It is obvious within the first few minutes of the film that Katie has serious issues.  Katie Kampenfelt is a master manipulator who disassociates  herself from the realities of her life by entering a self-made fantasy world.  This is the defense mechanism she uses to cope. Unfortunately, it only leads to further damage of her soul.
The all-star cast includes: Britt Robertson, Christian Slater, Martin Sheen and Justin Long.  The original soundtrack (made up entirely of songs by unknown female singer-songwriters 21 years old and younger) counterpoints the poignant, joyful, and disturbing life of the anonymous undiscovered gyrl.
This film will touch your heart in its deepest places, while the shocking ending will leave you gasping for breath.

6872169,5,B00QJAZ4MY,Very good.,1419724800,,10,4.5
6872170,4,B00QJAZ4MY,truly a wonderful movie - and the end is chilling.,1419638400,3,50,4.1
6872171,4,B00QJAZ4MY,"Katie (Britt Robertson) was accepted at Tufts University and has a great life in front of her, if she just knew what she wanted. She opts to take a year off to figure that out, a year that really messes up her life. Katie writes a blog. She changes names and details, i.e. the people we see are those that she blogs about. She likes older men and sex in general and has no trouble cheating on her 15 second boyfriend (Max Carver).

Katie is a confused person who goes from being tough to very sensitive. She believes that people who have lives don't write or read blogs (Phew! I that they were going to say Amazon reviews.) In the middle of film she gets a note from her boss on the ""10 Basic Truths of Life."" These are things we all know is true about life, but never want to admit. I found some of them interesting and none I would totally disagree with, if I decided to be truly honest.

The ending of the film was a total surprise. My first impression was ""Is this based on a true story?"" Second impression, ""They didn't know how to end it."" and third impression, ""Oh I can see this is where they were meant to be.""

This is perhaps a hip ""Lifetime"" type film that would have massive teen girl appeal.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Britt Robertson, Gia Mantegna) 3 1/2 STARS",1419638400,34,1277,4.264462809917355
6872172,4,B00QJAZ4MY,"This starts out as an emotionally honest coming of age story about a teenage girl. She keeps a blog that works as a plot device to reveal her innermost feelings. Of course, like many young women she has relationships with older guys. The sex isn't prurient. It's realistic. The movie follows her as she starts to realize that maybe this isn't the best way to live her life. At the beginning of the movie she's shallow and manipulative but seems to be becoming more mature and caring.

Later there's a hint of childhood sexual abuse. To me this seemed like too pat an explanation for the girl's behavior. Then the ending was totally off the wall. In terms of fiction I would say it did not fulfill the promise of the story.",1419552000,5,722,4.46969696969697

I felt frustrated for the main character and her flaws but then background about her childhood (child of divorce and another tragic reoccurring event) was revealed that explained her struggle in life. The end has an unexpected twist and was eye-opening for me as a viewer. Specifically, at one point the main character says something to the effect of ""I'd rather be busy living life than posting/blogging about it"". Incredibly true in today's social media society.",1523836800,,522,5.0813953488372094
6872176,5,B00QJAZ4MY,"Great movie, the actress is really good. the subject is really important. the way the story develops it starts showing he self discovering. The movie represents very well what many girls go through life... very realistic. The end shows a little hope, sadly she couldn'd cope with the reality of her own existency and run away... she didn't have a real base or close relationship to get hooked to something good. the movie really shows a story of a girl, that has a lack of father love as a child, sexually abused , had no self-esteem, no values on her body, no brain, try to please guys by her body, she was completely lost, sorry that it didn't had a happy end.",1523318400,,662,4.434426229508197

6872182,4,B00QJAZ4MY,"It looked like a romantic comedy. That couldn't be farther from the truth. This movie has so much depth, it is piled layers upon layers thick!
It's actually a brilliant piece of work. Completely unexpected. The subject matter may be offensive to some, but it's one of those things that should be brought out into the light. I praise the author of the written work, because they dared to say what is usually kept behind closed doors, in closets really, which helps absolutely no one and propagates the endless cycle of pain & misery for the person experiencing those issues. For some this may be a great Who done it experience, a puzzle to be solved only by the perception of the viewer, with multiple, endless, really, possible endings. I would have given it 5 stars, had it not been for the closure I did not get. I feel like I needed that, but again, like one of the characters says not in the same words though, life is not a fairy tale, there are no happy endings..Brilliant work, absolutely great!",1521676800,7,1002,4.541436464088398

But she begins to find who she is in this wonderful tale of disappointment and how we deal with disappointments.  It's one of those movies where if you blink or talk over a scene you might miss an important detail.  The ending (something that drives everyone's review, especially on this site) is something to be taken first hand.  I'll not spoil the ending.  I'll just say it caught me completely of guard.  I love all sorts of literature and many filmmakers carry a story in the exact same manner.  This story has a few similarities in spots, but I've only ever seen this type of direction for an ending one other time.  I was pleased someone had the audacity to end it the way it ended.",1520121600,,844,4.428571428571429
6872195,5,B00QJAZ4MY,Britt does a great job. The supporting actors make her character work. The ending is worrisome as Im not familiar with the book. Is this based on real circumstances or is this just literary license? Is Amy Grantham real?,1520121600,,220,4.666666666666667

If it was based on a true story, then they should have said when it happened and who the people were, and maybe a quick update on the search.

6872203,4,B00QJAZ4MY,"At first I didn't like it and I almost stopped watching it.  It seemed just another picture of an scatter brain and promiscuous teenager with zero self-esteem but then it grabbed me and what emerged was a traumatized girl desperately looking for love because she couldn't love herself.  Her ending was very sad but predictable.  I believe her boss killed her and artfully disposed of her body because out of all the losers she bedded, he had the most to lose and the means to do it or to hire someone who would do it for him.  I don't want to ruin it for new viewers but the last call she received was from him.  She flew to meet him because he affected her the most and she was desperate to hear that she hadn't just been another sex toy for him.  A very sad, pathetic teen expertly played by Britt Robertson.  Unfortunately they are many teens like this in our society who grow up lacking the most fundamental things for a successful life, self-esteem, self awareness and self respect.",1517961600,4,987,4.45

6872206,1,B00QJAZ4MY,"I watched for 30 minutes and couldn't stand another minute.  I like Britt Robertson.  I love Martin Sheen, Justin Long.  But what a load of rubbish .  What's more, I'm SO TIRED of the BORING inclusion of people having sex (very badly) as though it's not a movie unless people are shown having sex.  I am not a prude, but this movie would have been termed pornographic 15 years ago, maybe even 10 years ago.  Showing people having orgasims, having a Dad refer to the Mother as (I know I can't put the most offensive word here because oh yes, Netflix will DELETE IT OR write me back telling me they can't post my review) .  So it's ok to say that in a movie, a term which denigrates women to the max but of course we can't say that in a review.

The storyline appears to be that of a young girl who thinks so little of herself that she defines herself by sex.... first with an older guy who already has a girlfriend and then sort of with her boyfriend.  No wonder girls think that this is the way to behave.

Add the awful generic beat non music and it's just awful.

What a dreadful excuse for a movie.  Thumbs way down.",1517011200,2,1119,4.177570093457944

6872249,5,B00QJAZ4MY,"This movie is a character study of a very young woman entering adulthood, with no real tools to do so. We watch as she cycles through making the same terrible choices over and over again, and it suddenly crystallizes when we learn she was molested as a child.

Having spent a good part of my life working with abused children, these behaviors are all too common, and this film is a testament to the long-term effects of child abuse. Because children are learning about the world and their place in it, their resiliency allows them to accept ""new"" things, even terrible ones, as a part of life. It's like putting a band-aid on a broken leg, though. Without a cast, the leg never heals correctly; the child becomes an adult with a limp, and has to find myriad ways to accommodate it.

This film is terrible and beautiful in its accuracy and sensitivity to the damaged main character. The plot twist in the final moments was gasp-inducing, but unfortunately all too common for young people with this type of baggage. This movie will stick with me for awhile. I like to think that the main character had an epiphany and suddenly found her way to a fulfilling adulthood. Even though I know the statistical likelihood is that she was murdered, either out of jealousy, fear of paternity, threat of divorce, or possibly things the movie never clues us into such as an outstanding drug debt.

6872269,4,B00QJAZ4MY,"I love the actress and I love the movie.

The story of the girl may be considered as a ""problematic issue"" caused by a problematic family and sexual abuse experience in young age. When this girl grew up, not only the relationships problem with guys confused her which shares a great proportion of all problems, but also decisions making of directions of life. But I have to say, no one is 100% problem free or pure normal in the world. Everyone has confused what life will be in future and we may have this kind or that kind of problems. According to Freud, the problems are caused by something not supposed to happen in our childhood and different patterns of our sexual desire. I wouldn't say it's totally correct but it is a good reference of a conceptual framework to help us to think of the existing questions and problems.

The only way to live better is not only to explore why problems and questions exist but face the problems and try to defeat them. I like the boy in the movie saying ""to get to know yourself"". The way to know yourself or to get a self-awareness, self-conscious is to interact with people, to deal with relationships or making decisions.

All the artists put in great performances especially Britt. I thought she was o.k. In ""Tomorrowland"" but in this movie when she reacts to seeing her father's old wristwatch she won me over. I can see her becoming an actress on par with Claire D., Natalie P., Mila K., and a select few others. Christian Slater and Martin Sheen reinforce the fact that they are also artists in the true sense of the word. The way that the writers and director wrap up the story at the end is brilliant!

6872310,5,B00QJAZ4MY,"Ask Me Anything is quite possibly a masterpiece.  At first I never would've guessed the story would only get more interesting as it goes along because it felt like a typical drama involving a fairly normal teenager, but it does in fact improve in a big way.  It's about a teenage girl played by Britt Robertson who wants to take a year off before attending college to explore her sexual adventures and blog writing skills.  Now I don't know much about blogs so I thought it was a little odd she'd show excitement to her mother when she announces that she started a blog, but apparently such a thing is a big deal after all.

What makes the story so good is how Britt gets caught up with way too many men.  She doesn't really come across like a skank who sleeps around and at least initially seems like a level headed person who has her life planned out.  She feels like she's in control.  However later, after the amount of men she's slept with starts getting out of control and her emotional state of mind deteriorates, that's when the story gets even better.  The movie has a comedic edge to it, while still maintaining a drama feel.

Anyway Britt likes older men so the first man we see her sleep with is Justin Long (and my goodness he looks like David Schwimmer from Friends).  This is the main reason she wanted to take a year off from college- because she wanted to explore her sexual side with this guy.  However things fall apart later when it's evident the two are meant to go their own ways.  I won't spill the beans and say why or how.  She's secretly doing this guy while dating her other boyfriend (Max Carver).  At first Max seems like a clueless frat boy that doesn't really care about Britt, but he has a very violent side to his character that caught me by surprise.  Very good moment of writing there.

She's not quite done doing guys just yet!  There's also Christian Slater, who plays an excitable father that Britt goes to when it's time to babysit the family baby, drink wine and attend parties.  It's quite courageous that Britt and Christian make out with each other the moment Christian's wife leaves the room to check on the baby.  She also becomes friends with Max Hoffman's character.  Surprisingly not a sexual thing in this case!  I guess she needs to focus on her blog and other things once in a while too.

There's other men that dominate her life.  Her father, Robert Patrick's character, is a lazy drunk who sits around on the couch all day with his Middle Eastern wife.  He's somewhat obnoxious but funny in an offensive kind of way.  He's such a drunk person that Britt thinks whenever her parents give her the silent treatment, it's because they have bad news to report... and the news is going to relate to him.  Andy Buckley is her mom's father.  Britt likes to make fun of him and refers to him as ""moustache"" after her mom walks in and says she's going to marry the guy.  The timing here was hilarious because again, Britt expected bad news related to her father only to discover the mom is about to announce a marriage.  She also hangs out with a friend but it never goes anywhere meaningful.  At least, it tries to but falls apart by the second half.

It's surprising that by the end of the movie, the bookseller played by Martin Sheen turns out to be the one person she mostly depends on for advice (even though Britt's mother found out he did something very bad when he was a young man).  However this movie does the ultimate in surprise- I did NOT see that ending!  It's chilling to say the least and makes me question if it's based on a real story.  It surely looked that way when they show the ""real"" people portraying the actors/actresses in the movie (I have to put ""real"" in quotation marks because I'm not sure if they're the actual friends, boyfriends and parents connected to the real girl portrayed by Britt Robertson- this could be a carefully elaborate piece of fiction).  I want to spoil what happens at the very end so my review doesn't sound confusing but it would be lousy to ruin it.  Let's just say it relates to blogging, computers and technology as a whole and being feed up with it all.  She took Martin's advice apparently, and it's a different kind of ending.

Overall Britt Robertson plays an interesting, mentally troubled, sexually active, quirky character.  For the most part this movie is appropriate for teens, but a couple segments show brief nudity and another scene I can remember describes sex in detail that's a little inappropriate, but otherwise a really well-told and complex movie that only gets more interesting/elaborate as it goes on.  This film is also brilliant assuring that each and every character gets the proper amount of attention needed to fulfill the story in a satisfying way (well except for Britt's one friend I suppose, bot everyone else gets enough attention for sure).  Highly recommended for everyone.",1443744000,3,4905,4.56

It appears to be a third party view of a nymphomaniac, a girl who is deferring college for a year and chooses to have sex with multiple partners and to blog about it. Later in the film, it is revealed that she is under psychiatric care, ie visits a counsellor. The movie details her sexual liaisons with 3 men, and platonic relationships with 2 others. 2 are college professors, and her best friend is another college girl type. At the end, her mother enters the picture, stating that her daughter has disappeared without a trace in her car. It turns out her life and friends are not nearly as glamorous as detailed in the film. The action seen in the film is largely from her imagination as detailed in her blog. Her mother is desperately trying to locate her. Her own photo indicates that she is not nearly as glamorous and the actress (Britt Robertson).

This movie grabbed me the minute it started (the soundtrack is excellent). On top of an amazing cast, this movie felt completely authentic. Its extremely hard to find something original anymore, that actually makes you stop and think. The detail in both the book (Undiscovered Gyrl) and film were what sealed the deal. When Katie is standing in front of the mirror with makeup all over her face, or when she over reacts to her mom, the way she runs from store to store looking for jobs, or the slightly inappropriate jokes she makes to Christian Slater on the first phone call. Real emotions and actions of young adults.

This is a sleeper. Wonderfully acted and produced.

I was thinking that if I had a teenage daughter I would probably make her watch it, even with all the sex and just general bad behavior.  As a mom myself to a girl, and still not too far off from those wild and free teenage years I think this movie does a remarkable job of telling the truth.  Girls project so much onto their relationships, use sex as a way to feel love, but so much of it is a lie.  This movie shows that in a very powerful way.

6872328,4,B00QJAZ4MY,"People are making a lot noise about this flick when in fact it's really simple. At least that's my take on it. This is a story about a typical, confused, abused 18 year old young woman. She's loose in her morals, funny, manic, beautiful and extremely lax in judgment. Sort of but not completely like all teenage girls and young women. Guys who opine on Britt Robertson's character say that she does things that make no sense. NO KIDDING. The character is a girl and no guy can truly understand young girls or women.

The Book and the Movie do one thing I think is really cool. They go into a long winded description of this character and her life. The goal of the main part of the movie is to get the viewer to know the character well. Then comes the 'twist' that isn't really a twist. It's the real part of the story. The one you're supposed to pay attention to. Suddenly, near the end of the movie everything changes. Now you're looking at completely different people who are the 'real' folks concerned.

The incident that occurs (no spoilers here) is portrayed suddenly and it makes no real sense. It's not supposed to make sense. It's supposed to shock you and surprise you. Imagine being the parents of a young woman who has this happen to her. Just like when it really happens multiple times a day in this country. There are friends and family that are utterly shocked and have no answers. Only emptiness and terror for what may have happened. The incident is portrayed here to show the helplessness of having this happen. You only get to know the character so you can feel the helplessness of losing the character. I think this is a pretty good movie. It shocks you at the end. It makes you think for a few days. Why did they do it that way? They did it that way because it's pretty much the way it happens for real.",1431820800,23,1823,4.390532544378698

The movie essentially tells the story of a girl with a mean face who makes increasingly bad decisions while the audience follows along with terrible camera angles.

SPOILERS***(This movie is terrible)

This is the kind of movie that makes me hate actors.  Just a pretentious, stupid, and agonizing movie with no forward momentum.  Longest hour and a half in my life.  Then holy crap it gives us an ending from out of nowhere that is beyond dumb.  Suddenly in the last 2 minutes we find out that the blog she has been writing the whole movie is actually sugar coating things, and none of the people we got to know look anything like their counterparts.  It's not that she made anything up, the complete opposite, the movie says specifically that all the events happened just the way she said them.  So that means that the only thing different is the fact that her blog makes everyone look more attractive.  That's it.  So in the last 2 minutes we are introduced to the ""real"" versions of the people we met, who are just uglier.  They are fugly, and for some reason the main character has gone missing.  Makes me no damn sense whatsoever.  I don't care if this is the ending of the book.  Movies aren't books.  To suddenly tell us that the people we got to know aren't as attractive and have it switch gears is so weird and completely unnecessary.  The writer/director Allison Burnett has a lady name, and he is an idiot.  The girl in this flick is pretty but looks so angry.  She's going to be in Tomorrowland with George Clooney coming out this summer.

We follow her as she writes the blog of her sex life (graphic details not discussed, only a few gems plucked and placed in the opening credits) in the year between high school graduation and maybe going to college. Teenage romance with a violent undercurrent, cheaters, a criminal, and the girl who loves them all as she works through a painful childhood trauma and comes to terms with a father who lets everyone he loves down.

Firstly, it is not a comedy. So if you are looking to laugh, probably not the best bet. Second, it is not erotica, but there is brief nudity. Lastly, the movie can be a bit slow and bit profane--it is trying to convey something, but it relies on the audience to bring quite a bit to the table. I might read some of the reviews before watching it to gauge expectations and view it with the proper frame of mind. One suggestion I would offer to those interested in going beyond the title is to not focus on the protagonist (at least exclusively), because the commentary the movie is making through her about the society around her. Anyways, hope it helps!",1422748800,7,821,4.48
6872376,1,B00QJAZ4MY,"I have serious problems with the underlying premise always found in movies of this type. You can find that premise in the minds of the other reviewers: Sexually active teen girls/women in general must be somehow psychologically damaged and we better get to the bottom of why they want sex. It MUST be because they were abused.....

Perhaps it's this puritanical ethos that has women and girls suffering so much in our culture and around the world. The story recounts the difficulties endured by a teen girl coming into her sexuality.  Despite the intimations of the script the reasons this girl is struggling have most to do with her inattentive/alcoholic/dysfunctional family which leave her no way to significantly explore herself in a healthy way. This includes the total lack of a positive sexual role model, and no adult guidance for her budding sexuality etc. Sadly, as many girls find out this makes them prey for the poorly developed members of the male gender also known as predators, and narcississts, misogynists etc., and of course she runs into all of them along her path.

So 4 stars because it (hopefully) makes you think about the reality that young women naturally have sexual desire, they need guidance on how to satisfy that desire safely and with non-scumbag partners, and mothers who don't state 'my child is my whole life'....there's some pathology for us to ponder. This movie left a bad taste in my mouth.....so sick of the negative view point that it protrays and reinforces: female sexuality and desire must arise from pathology.....give me a break!

Lastly, is there no other role for Martin Sheen than that of the pompous gratuitous 'wisdom holder'? Ironically in this film we are ok with the fact that he's a sex offender who needs to lock the door and pull the shades to give his one off 'truth'....wtf? The whole premise was just too stupid to endure but it was a great portrayal of why teen girls often do have difficulty: we don't allow them to be the naturally sexual beings they are, and we give them no support.

6872384,4,B00QJAZ4MY,"My initial reaction was ""ugh, I hate the ending"" but upon reflection I came to realise that I only just dislike the ending. I'll explain more below(it WILL contain spoilers) but overall I liked the film. Britt Robertson was charming in the role and I rather liked her character. I enjoyed everything from her perspective. Most importantly, I enjoyed 97% of my time with this movie so I would still recommend it to friends, especially friends of mine who enjoy ambiguous endings.

Okay, to really get into what I think about this movie I *have* to spoil it. So stop reading NOW if you don't want it spoiled.

You've been warned.

The reason why I gave this movie four stars instead of five was because I had a couple problems with the ending of this movie. First, in parts of this movie I got the impression that perhaps they were trying to say that promiscuous sex was bad and trying to hit me over the head with this message. I was able to ignore that because I thought perhaps that was just me reading too much into lines which said something like ""sex always has consequences"". Which simply isn't true. Sure, sex with married people like she was having has consequences but for a large majority of those cases, it's mostly emotional pain and maybe divorce.

I digress.

The second problem I have with the ending is mostly a taste preference. I dislike ambiguous endings. I watch fiction to get a glimpse into the lives of characters and like a little closure in my fiction. Often when I express my disappointment in these types of endings, I get a response along the lines of ""well, in real life, you sometimes never know..."" except that this is fiction. You can tell me what happens(and should) because you're telling me a story. Stories demand closure. At least a little. Instead, you get to wonder if she died or if she had a secret stash of cash & ran away. I've decided to believe it's the latter as the former is far too depressing for an otherwise fun movie.

So, as long as you don't mind not really getting any closure in your movies, this movie would probably be five stars. Otherwise, I suggest you watch up until the mother starts talking.

Oh, one more point...that whole scene at the end got everyone in the room with me thinking ""wow, was this based on a true story?"" & after a quick Google search came up empty, they were disappointed that the movie made them feel that way.

Again, despite my problems with this movie, I'd still suggest people watch it as it's a rather enjoyable film and Britt Robertson(and supporting cast members too) puts on one of her best performances yet.",1421280000,5,2599,4.538461538461538

6872386,4,B00QJAZ4MY,"I thought this was going to be a ""naughty girl"" comedy. But it turned out to be more than that. Excellent acting. This seemed a bit of a step down for Christian Slater. But he brought his A Game anyway. The main character played her role perfectly. She exuded the girl/woman/vixen/victim of her beauty quite well.

That's all I can say. You'll want to watch closely. All is not perfect in her world although it's very beautiful. Britt Robertson will become a star because of this film.

By the time the movie was done, I thought the characters were poorly established and the plot simplistic with Robertson, the lead actress seemed like a fourteen year old who was pretending to have a hard life.",1420329600,9,534,4.6

6872400,4,B00QJAZ4MY,"Ask Me Anything is mostly a good movie, with great performances by the entire cast, especially Britt Robertson in the leading role.  The script was okay, but nothing special.  My only serious problem with it was with the ending, which I found disconcerting and off-putting, but that might just be me.

The entire cast gave excellent performances, but Britt Robertson's were especially noteworthy.  She managed to walk the line between being too subtle and too heavy handed in her performance and the results are amazing.  I think she has the potential to be one of the top actresses of the early twenty-first century.

If you haven't already read the plot, it's about a newly graduated high school student who decides to take a year off college.  The story follows her sexual misadventures as she hooks up with much older men, including a college professor and a married man for whom she is working as a nanny.  It's really about how she works through these relationships and the heartaches they bring.  The ending, however, devolves into a morality tale about the lies we live and how we spruce our lives (and our lies) to look better on social media.  Without giving away specifics, I found the ending jarring and off-putting, as have many people who've seen it, judging from online comments.

None-the-less, I would recommend it, simply because the performances are so good they shouldn't be missed.  Also, the story itself is not bad until the very end.  So, yes, definitely see it.",1420156800,4,1486,4.849206349206349
6872401,5,B00QJAZ4MY,"This is a seriously great movie, and in a class by itself. There is no other movie that does quite what it does, or that portrays what it portrays as WELL as what it portrays.

It amazes me that male screenwriter/director/producer Allison Burnett was able to portray a dysfunctional American girl, especially a 17 year old, so effectively. This film could be shown in college psychology courses, and would be singularly informative for that purpose.

I loved the novel it is based upon (Undiscovered Gyrl) as well.

Some movies are in a class by themselves: the only way to learn what they have to say is to watch that exact movie. Ask Me Anything is one of these. The messages contained in this movie have never been expressed this way before, and never so clearly. This is an important film for that reason.

Young pretty girls have a certain power and a recklessness that only appears at specific ages. A girl a few years younger than the protagonist could not have been so ruthlessly sexual. A girl a few years older probably would have been less manic, and more cautious and careful in her behavior. So Burnett has created a unique portrayal of a special time in life that is extremely transient, yet interesting and important.

The film is also a significant portrayal of contemporary culture. It makes a strong statement about youth culture in this country right now.

A lot of films about young girls behaving badly are distinctly voyeuristic. They may be about girls, but they appear to be created for adult males. As a result of this, the portrayal of the girl protagonists tends to be a little thin and flat.

This film avoids this. It gets you inside the head of its fascinating lead character in a way that is extremely uncommon. The film is psychologically deep. You feel that you can really understand the motivations and core desires of the girl. I am a big fan of ""coming of age"" movies and have watched quite a few of them. I can't think of any other one that is quite as revealing of the inner life of its protagonist. In most of the others, there is a sense of being somewhat ""outside"" of the inner life of the main character. Her motivations remain more mysterious, in my opinion, in most movies of this type.

There is little of the all-pervasive ""male gaze"" in this film. There are sex scenes and nudity, but never gratuitous, simply there to titillate the male viewer.

One obvious recent contrast is the 2013 French coming of age film Jeune & Jolie (Young and Beautiful), starring Marine Vacth, about a teenager who becomes a prostitute for no clear reason. I enjoyed this film very much, but it was soft porn to a large extent, and you never really understood exactly why the protagonist was so self- destructive.

With all the sex, and an impossibly hot and compelling-looking lead, Ask Me Anything could have easily ended up being like this. Yet it avoids it, and is probably just as attractive and interesting for females as it is for males. (There is plenty of eye candy for the ladies here, as well.)

The acting is superb. Britt Robertson has to pull off a whole lot of very different emotions, and she clearly has what it takes to do so. The men have to portray a bunch of different male types, including some distinctly creepy ones, and they do a tremendous job. The two nice guys are REALLY nice. Martin Sheen is amazing as an obviously warm, kind, older person. Christian Slater is so obviously dark and creepy that he had my skin crawling when Robertson was making out with him. And Robertson does an astonishing job of exhibiting her extraordinary sexual power. In a scene where she is coming on strong to her employer, in the kitchen, my heart stopped a few times. And I consider myself fairly jaded and not easily manipulated by films this way.

The sets are interesting, and the way they are lit is terrific; very intimate, with lots of depth. Plenty of closeups to create a kind of suffocating effect. The soundtrack is awesome. The songs by unknown girls are moving and appropriate, and the background music works perfectly. The end titles song is especially terrific.

See this movie. You will not be disappointed.",1420070400,41,4158,4.640816326530612
