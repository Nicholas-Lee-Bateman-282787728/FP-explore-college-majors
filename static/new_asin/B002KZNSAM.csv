8372286,3,B002KZNSAM,"If you love the old coming attractions trailers you will enjoy this compilation of 57 of them, mostly from the late 1930's to the early 1960's. Quite a mixed bag in this volume, a little too much schlock like ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"", ""Fiend of Dope Island"" , ""Madmen of Mandoras"" and ""The Vampire Beast Craves Blood"" for my taste but there are classics like ""The Wizard of Oz"" (2 different trailers), the ""Thin Man"" series and ""The Maltese Falcon"" here too. Lots of horror and science fiction, both classic and almost unknown are also here. Not bad but not as good as the original volume ""Coming Attractions Time"" in the choice of titles and video quality. I'd definitely make the original your first purchase in this series. If you enjoy that one, go for this one but expect a little less. I also have to take a star away because this is a DVD-R (the same kind you burn in your computer or your standalone DVD recorder) rather than a regular pressed DVD. Consensus of opinion is that these are potentially trouble prone and may not last as long as a regular DVD. In any case this format should be noted in the product description and on the DVD cover. Still recommended if you love old trailers!",1260576000,3,1202,4.493150684931507
8372287,5,B002KZNSAM,"I confess. I love movie trailers. They show you the best scenes of the movie in under a minute. They're usually better than the movies they advertise. This collection is for movies of the 1930s-1960s mostly. There are a lot of great movie ads, and some drive-in snack bar intermissions. See Bogart stroll into a library and ask librarian Lorren Bacall for a book as exciting as The Maltese Falcon. See ads for sequels to The Thin Man. See ads for The Wizard of Oz, Harvey,Secret Agent Fireball,and more! Get the popcorn!",1250208000,3,520,4.663043478260869
