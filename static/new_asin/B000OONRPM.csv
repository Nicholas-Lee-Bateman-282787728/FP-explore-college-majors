8185778,1,B000OONRPM,"Not really into yoga and was looking for something simple. It was really odd that some of the exercises said you SHOULDN'T use if you have hypertension which is what I thought this ""Yoga for Hypertension"" video was about!",1427328000,,221,4.6923076923076925
8185779,4,B000OONRPM,"Was pretty good, not hard at all to do, I've done several of the amazon video yoga videos, I have found that most do not have the warm up period and then the cool down at the end, I believe this one had the savasana at the end, but not much warm up and I feel a little sore afterwards. At yoga classes I go to, I do not feel at all sore afterward.",1425168000,,347,3.7027027027027026

8185781,3,B000OONRPM,"I was not impressed. Although the yoga performance and asanas are very authentic it appears somewhat mechanical. There is no flow between asanas and, of course, it will benefit you, just like any other yoga, but there is nothing special about this particular video.",1374624000,,265,5.045454545454546
8185782,5,B000OONRPM,"There are several DVDs produced by Swathi called the Sanskriti Series. These are India productions that I have discovered on Amazon just recently. Keep an eye out since the price can vary for each of the series. I have 2 of the DVD's: ""Yoga for Abdomen and Digestion""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Abdomen-and-Digestion-DVD/dp/B002BNFM84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Abdomen and Digestion DVD</a>&nbsp;(runs about 35 minutes and consists of 19 individual postures) and ""Yoga for Hypertension"" (runs about 20 minutes and consists of 11 individual postures). I got mine for $9.95 each with 2-day free amazon prime shipping (nice!).  There has been some criticism on other reviews of these DVD's that the menu system isn't very good. It wasn't a problem for me, you just have to hit the Skip or fast-forward on your DVD remote, then play 3 times to get past all the commercial intro stuff). It is a bit unusual, but once you get the hang of it, it's not a big deal.

This is not glamours video, rather a traditional practice with Indian students (one male, one female) in a small, simple studio. The setting consists of bright blue floors, bright yellow mat, and bright orange wall displays showing various stick-figure graphic yoga postures. The 2 students wear simple orange short sleeve shirts with dark blue pants. I love the practice it's self and it reminds me of ""Yin Yoga"" in that it is some-what passive by hold the pose, reflecting within, and connecting your mind with your body. It's a short enough practice that it doesn't take a big chuck of your time and is easily completed in the morning or evening.

Once you get to the main menu, you have two choices:

1. How to perform the Asanas.
This section has a menu selection for each of the postures in the ""Real Time Yoga Session, plus a section about meditation. This section helps to explain the postures if you have never done yoga before or need a refresher. This section will help you to actually understand the individual postures. The individual segments provide some rather interesting perspective of each of the postures. At first it seemed rather dramatic, but it really is helpful for explaining the background, benefits, and how to get into the posture. It explains how it affects the digestive system. Since the actual session does not explain verbally, it's very helpful that they included this section where you can practice each posture.

2. The Real Time Yoga Session. I LOVE this practice mainly because it does not include any verbal instruction. Each posture is first shown with the Sanskrit name and a stick-figure illustration, then a real person demonstrates how to get into the posture, then a bell rings to begin the hold of the pose. Each pose is held for 1-2 or more minutes, then the bell rings again. At first the bell startled me, but once I got used to it (and turned the volume down) I really enjoyed this non-verbal practice. There is no distraction of verbal cues and I was able to focus more on myself and my practice than the television screen. Once you go thru it a few times, you barely have to lookup to follow the sequencing..

Each posture is individually filmed, then patched together into the full practice. On the two DVDs that I have, some of the postures are a repeat with a few unique postures for the individual DVD. I actually like this since it gives some consistency to the practices, but variety to help with the particular focus (digestion or hypertension). The background music is soft and soothing and not too loud or distracting.

Compared to the Digestion DVD, this Hypertension DVD is much more suited to beginners and more of a relaxation (Yin like) practice. It does not include as many standing postures (no triangle or standing forward bend) and includes more sitting postures and sitting meditation. Both end with a beautiful, relaxing Savasana. I love this short practice on days when I need to rejuvenate and relax.

Here are the sequence of postures for the Hypertension  Practice.
1. The Padmasan. Sitting cross-legged with eyes closed. Several om's are practiced. (this posture is on the digestion DVD too)
2. The Tadasana. Variation I haven't seen before. Standing, lift arms overhead with hands folded out.  (This posture is on the digestion DVD too).
3. The Ardhakati Chakrasana. Standing, one arm overhead and bend sideways in the opposite direction, repeat on other side. (This posture is on the digestion DVD too.)
4. The Vajrasana. Sitting with legs folded under your body and hands on lap. Sit in stillness, clear your mind, and breath. Sit for several minutes and a perfect time between posture to meditate with either eyes open in a gaze or closed.  (This posture is on the digestion DVD too.)
5. Sasankasana. Child pose, sitting again with legs folded under your body. arms behind your back hold 1 wrist and round your body forward with forehead on the floor. Again, and excellent ""Yin Like"" posture for meditation and you will feel this in your throat chakra. (This posture is on the digestion DVD too.)
6. Jaanu Sirasasana. One leg seated forward bend. Fold one leg in and twist and round forward over the other outstretched leg. Hold, then repeat on other side. (This posture is on the digestion DVD too.)
7. The Paschimothasana. Seated forward bend. Both legs outstretched, fold forward with forehead towards knees and hold feet. This posture is on the digestion DVD too.)
8. The Siddhasana. Sitting with crossed legs in meditation mudra. Eye closed and focus (meditate) within. (This is NOT on the Digestion DVD).
9. The Halasana. Plow pose. Laying on back, bring legs above, then overhead. Beginners beware, don't go too far (you can rest your feet on a bed, couch, or large pillow). (This is NOT on the Digestion DVD.)
10. The Matsyasana. Fish pose. Lying on back, bring arms under the body, then arm back with top of head lightly on the floor. (it is very good to do this posture right after the inversion. (This posture is on the digestion DVD too.)
11. The Savasana. Resting on back, stillness. Also called corpse pose. This final posture can be held as long as you like. The soft music continues and there is not an ending bell on this last posture, so you can take the time you need to rest and revitalize yourself. (This posture is on the digestion DVD too.)

I will use this DVD for years to come and follow the practice and re-play the verbal instruction portions as well.

8185783,4,B000OONRPM,"Aside from the fact that the intro is too long and can't be bypassed this is a great bargain.  The directions/demonstrations are very easy to follow.  The music is pleasant.

I'm not a person who likes classes and I really don't like classes when I'm the least competent person.  This DVD allows me to get better, gain more confidence and get more flexible in the privacy of my own home.  I do the asanas six days a week and I'm gradually improving.

My blood pressure is going down, but I'm also fasting so the improvement is not just based on the yoga.  I'm chronicling my attempt to lower my blood pressure on [...]",1320451200,6,618,4.415929203539823
8185784,1,B000OONRPM,"Don't even think of buying this DVD, the DVD is not what it said it is. Different director, only 55 mins, rather then 126mins. The real cover is horrible, something that you would never buy. So either the seller made a mistake that it is a different product. or the description is wrong.
I bought many yoga for children dvd, but this one, I don't even want to open it and return right away.",1300406400,2,390,4.283783783783784
