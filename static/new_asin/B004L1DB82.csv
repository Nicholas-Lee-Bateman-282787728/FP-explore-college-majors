4399614,1,B004L1DB82,"I've received the DVD today,
thinking that my Son would be happy,
and it turned out to be the greatest disappointment!
The Disc seemed to be in good Condition,
but it showed Issues at the very first Viewing.
It skipped through the entire Movie and froze several times,
so that we had to eject the Disc several Times to start over again
... or it just showed a blank blue Screen.
I know I've purchased a ' USED ' DVD,
but hey, they shouldn't be sold this jacked up!!! - Total waste of Money.",1403740800,,490,4.223404255319149
4399615,1,B004L1DB82,"....although my children seemed to enjoy it. I would not recommend it. If you want to watch a soccer movie, GOAL! was really good.",1400803200,,130,4.458333333333333
4399616,2,B004L1DB82,"Where is the soccer ? It sounds like a sports movie, or at least some adventure for boys thing... but it's a bad romance, very silly and pointless.",1400630400,,147,4.285714285714286
4399617,2,B004L1DB82,Foreign film dubbed in English.  My kids noticed right away.  Watching once was enough. The content was more teen appropriate than for elementary age.,1400371200,3,150,5.208333333333333
4399618,5,B004L1DB82,Though it was dubbed in english it was still a very great movie by itself i will buy and watch the original german seires even with out subtitles!,1381363200,,146,4.25
4399619,4,B004L1DB82,"There was alot of action,and it was a fast paced movie. I thought the part about the girl was not important part of the movie. I thought the rest of parts worked well.",1361664000,,167,4.090909090909091
4399620,4,B004L1DB82,"First up, this was clearly a German movie overdubbed into English.  To be honest, that isn't as annoying as it sounds.  This movie has a weird charm to it, it really is like a soccer game set in the world of Mad Max.  The look of the whole thing is post-apocalyptic, and the main ""villain"" is doing his best ""Johnny Depp"" impression.  Yet, I really enjoyed it.  Someone complained because it wasn't enough about soccer, but really it isn't meant to be, it's about a group of kids dealing with each other.  It really does remind me of the sandlot and a bunch of other similar movies.
  I enjoyed it, despite it's drawbacks.",1348617600,,622,4.442477876106195
4399621,1,B004L1DB82,"I purchased this movie thinking that it would be like the movie ""The Sandlot,"" but for soccer. Wow, was I wrong. This movie was terrible. First, the film was dubbed over in English so it was distracting to watch and the story itself was bad! I was expecting something based on the first WSB book, but this one was about Vanessa (one of the soccer players) leaving the bunch to date ""The Pale Vampire,"" who was a skater kid. About 10 minutes of the movie were spent playing soccer and the rest was about Vanessa leaving the group and what the group was going to do about it. There was also a fair amount of time spent on witchcraft..there was a scene where The Pale Vampire sacrifices the soccer ball to this statue of a witch and then the WSB tries to get Vanessa and the field back by using witch-like creatures. I am hoping to return this, it was truly awful.",1303344000,18,861,4.320987654320987
4399622,1,B004L1DB82,"This is NOT a US release of ""The Wild Soccer Bunch"", as we were led to believe --- it is one of the later episodes. Episode One is the only one not released with English subtitles, so people who expected to be able to finally enjoy the whole series have been doubly duped --- by not getting what we ordered, and by ending up with a useless spare copy of a later episode.
Avoid this item...and avoid dealing with a producer who rips off customers like this!!!!!",1303171200,11,460,4.2988505747126435
4399623,5,B004L1DB82,"It is actually a great movie, if the voice is not in English. The voice is super awkward and the translation just makes me laugh so hard. Really recommend everyone to watch the Germany original one, even if you are a grown-up. Five stars for the cool kids and friendship.",1481068800,,271,4.44
4399624,1,B004L1DB82,Not very good but at least we didn't have to pay extra for it.,1479772800,,62,3.5

4399627,1,B004L1DB82,Terrible!,1476230400,,9,9.0
4399628,2,B004L1DB82,"I've seen the original in German, also known as Die Wilden Kerle, I really wish Americans would leave the subtitles in and not try voice overs, man they really botched the job. They had these kids looking like they only spoke gibberish. Of course I am sure the reason for that is the actual amount of foul language used by the kids in this film. Americans are to uptight about everything and really need to get over it. At one point in the movie they mentioned how they wanted to play on the US team, I about laughed myself to death. I mean come on why would German football players wanna play on a soccer team when Americans can't even get the fact it is Football!  Keep up the chest thumping I am sure we will always look like fools to the rest of the world.

I would rate this five stars but was sadly disappointed by the way it was Americanized.  It is no wonder the American people find foreign films to be trash.  I really feel sorry for the loss of culture in this country.

The books were okay, since they too were also translated from German, and if you have watched any film made from a book you will find most do not follow the book. So in reality the film studio's need to correct the term 'based on a novel by,' to 'loosely based on a novel by,' since it is the director's perception of what the movie should be.  Also since this is based on an actual team and coach who wrote these books I really wish they would have left the subtitle's in and allowed the movie to run properly. If you get a change check out the German version it is so much better, then the Americanized version and not plagiarized. That was another disappointing thing I found was the changes they made to make it sound like a US made movie.",1474848000,2,1725,4.227963525835866
4399629,1,B004L1DB82,This movie is not about soccer. Themes are more geared to tween/teen audience.,1472774400,,78,5.076923076923077

4399631,3,B004L1DB82,"It was a good film about kids in Germany fighting over territory and girls,good laughs. I am thinking of buying it .",1464998400,,116,4.318181818181818
4399632,1,B004L1DB82,"This was the weirdest movie I have ever seen!  It held my six year old son's attention for about a half hour.  The voices do not match the characters movements, it must be a foreign film.",1464912000,,187,4.166666666666667

4399640,1,B004L1DB82,"I thought that this movie was going to be good, but it disappointed me. The production was low budget and the acting was lousy. I think there were several boy soccer movies made in Great Britain that were better than this.",1460073600,,222,4.439024390243903

4399645,5,B004L1DB82,"The terrible reviews are due to the fact, that this film is not translatable and looses everything by trying to dub it. But when you know the story behind the books and the film: The 'Wilden Kerlen' are based on a true story. The soccerclub ""Die Wilden Kerle"" really existed in Munich, it's trainer Joachim Masannek wrote the books to motivate the team, because his sons Leon Wessel Masannek und Marlon Wessel were part of the team.  Manassek then directed the films, which were and still are a huge succes in germany. Those Films that show the world as the kids would like it, with soccer, freedom and time without adults. All of my three children are huge fans - the girls even more than my son. And no other series of films encouraged talk about friendship, team spirit, courage and loyalty. But 'Die wilden Kerle' don't deliver education every second, as a lot of the american films do. They are just fun. The irish cousins learn german just to be able understand those films - what a motivation.",1456012800,,1000,4.58659217877095

4399647,1,B004L1DB82,"Ok, first why do they called ""Wild soccer."" Their isn't any soccer played though the movie. Sadly, they switch the subject to being about gangs, strange right?
The cast looks like a bad 80s music video.. whats up with that `Germany?
 And the kid gang seem like TERRIBLE ACTORS, at least with bad english overdubs, might be better in native german, I don't know.
the costumes??? It's terrible...
Though people physically looked good in the movie (Only positive feedback). good genes...but bad idea for a movie.",1451260800,2,509,4.9186046511627906

4399659,2,B004L1DB82,"My 7 year old soccer playing grandson read all the Wild Soccer Bunch books, and he was very excited to watch this DVD.  Unfortunately, the movie had nothing to do with the books, and very little to do with actually playing soccer.  It was really not intended for a young audience at all - some very mature themes, more appropriate for pre-teens, or at least older kids.",1413590400,5,369,4.492537313432836
