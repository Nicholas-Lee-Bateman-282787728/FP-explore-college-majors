Clair has never been baptized, and his clever wife  tricks him into it. This movie will leave you laughing until your stomach  hurts.

546924,5,6303079709,"I laughed throughout the entire movie. It was a well written story on how a man who really cared for the best things in life for his family and how he perceived his responsibility toward/for them. Clare's daily not knowing  who the maid was maintained a high level of surprise. Vinnie understanding  of money was humorous with her explaination to Clare was eventful. No  matter how much Clare seemed to have himself together, his family was  always spontaneous in their actions and attitudes. I loved every minute of  it.",940377600,2,521,4.808988764044944

546926,5,6303079709,"""I couldn't go to Heaven without Clare.  Why, I get lonesome for him even when I go to Ohio.""  Such is the relationship of Clare and his wife Vinnie.  She gives, he yells.  Their children are little devils  dresses up as angels, but who cares?  They're all hilarious.  Vinnie knows  Clare loves her, because she keeps reminding him he does, but he never  tells her.  He is rather dominating, and very opinionated.  Vinne likes to  spend money, and she has to trick Clare when it comes to him paying the  bills.  This movie is really the story of their oldest son Clarence, and  his troubles with his father (hence the name).  Well, when he falls in love  (with Elizabeth Taylor; I forgot her name so we'll call her Liz), his dad  gives him some pointers.  Let the women know who is boss.  However, Clare  doesn't know what to do when the woman cries, as he finds out when Vinnie  gets sick.  She also gets exasperated with Clare because he won't get  baptized (because of Liz, the fact is revealed that he wasn't baptized.  He  decides it's pointless.  Vinnie tells him he won't go to Heaven, but he's  confident she'll get him in.  Vinnie is worried, Because if he isn't  baptized, he has no name.  Therefore they are not married, and their  children are illegitimate).  Clarence has to get Liz to like him, Clare  must realize that being baptized is necessary, and Vinnie just has to deal  with everyone.  All in all a great movie for the family to watch.  Everyone  will love it when Clare screams ""Oh gad!"" for the 8 billionth  time!",933379200,3,1537,4.490842490842491

547060,1,6303079709,Sad movie depicting a father who is verbally abusive to his children and wife - and the employees who work for him.  I realize we are supposed to laugh at the father figure here.  But there is nothing amusing about a father who abuses his family this way.  The mother is depicted as being ignorant and accepting of the abuse.  It is especially sad when the father verbally abuses the mother in front of the children.  This is just a horrible movie.  It seems to want to make us laugh at a controlling and horribly abusive man's actions within his family.,1513987200,,554,4.435643564356436

547165,4,6303079709,"Life With Father is William Powell's greatest role.  While he is perfection itself as Nick Charles - or as any other character he ever portrayed - he absolutely smashes the role of the ""never in control as much as he'd like to be, or thinks he is"" title character, Clarence Day Sr, in this movie.  Based on a play, which was based on a book by Clarence Day Jr (available, along with Life With Mother, as a download from Amazon, and which I highly recommend if you like this movie), Life With Father is a marvelous peek into upper class family life during the 1880s.  Colorful, exceptionally acted by all players, filled with laughs and fantastic scenery, it is my go-to way of escaping the hectic pace of today's insane world.  The disk itself is not great, however: sound quality is variable (a common problem I've noticed with releases of old movies) and the picture is a bit grainy.  When I had cable and watched these same old movies on TCM, the overall quality was quite a bit better, so I'm forced to conclude that the DVD burning process is at fault.  With today's technology, I only hope they improve it - soon!  If they release a remastered version of Life With Father you can bet I'll be purchasing it!",1504828800,4,1212,4.4818181818181815

547169,5,6303079709,"Before you judge the characters in this movie, you will have to shed your 21st century beliefs and open your mind to life as it was some hundred and thirty years ago - 1883 to be exact. The father is not a 'chauvinist'. He is a patriarch trying to bring order as he understands it to his family - most of the time he doesn't succeed. He is brilliantly played by William Powell who was nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie and won the New York Critics award for 'best actor' of 1947. If you have seen him in other movies (the Thin Man series, Libeled Lady, My Man Godfrey, etc.) you will see that this role was quite a departure from his usual easy-going comedic manner - hence the awards. Women in that era usually got their way in the family by manipulating their spouse or 'asking forgiveness and not permission' which is still used in our 'modern' era by people who feel powerless. I first heard that phrase at work. This woman spent her life on raising children she could be proud of and making a home which was beautiful and well run, using the money her husband provided for her. My own mother left her own career for precisely that reason - thank God.  Our 21st century woman has often opted for career and independence, as well as divorce, single motherhood and misbehaving children who turn into misbehaving adults who feel entitled to blackmail their mother because they have been robbed of something they cannot even name. The children in this story must have taken the drama in their family with a pinch of salt, since the oldest boy was the one who wrote this book which turned into the long-running play and so he must have seen the humor in his family. That is what seems to be missing in our 21st century - a sense of humor. We have traded humor for anxiety, paranoia, and a need to blame others for our own unhappiness. You won't find any of that in this movie. You might even relax for a while from your own cares and envy those who grew up in a family like this.",1504051200,3,1994,4.331550802139038

547171,2,6303079709,"Rewatching this film after decades, I realize how much women were controlled and put down by men at the turn of the last century.  If the family had had a girl the story would have been much different.  The wife having to account for every last penny was very common; people like John D. Rockefeller, before his wealth, kept track of every penny he spent in a small account book.  Very common.  A better movie than this is Cheaper by the Dozen -- same era but a larger family with boys and girls and a Mother that was college-educated (not common in those days) who had MUCH more to say in the rearing of her children and was an equal with her husband.  Cheaper by the Dozen was about a real family -- the husband and wife were scientists who did time tests to determine how to cut down the time it took for manufacturing tasks and the like.  Meet Me in St. Louis is also a better choice than Life with Father.  In Life With Father the father comes off as an isolated buffoon who makes unfair demands on his family, ignores his kids and family doings, and only regrets his wife's possible demise in what it would mean to HIM -- the loss of someone whose sole task is to make his own life easier and more comfortable.  I hate men like that.  Not very good role models for our kids to see either.  This is an outdated, silly film.  Even Elizabeth Taylor has such silly lines it is hard for her deliver them with any sincerity -- she and Irene Dunne are the best actors in this film.",1503619200,2,1480,4.2313167259786475
547172,4,6303079709,"I found this movie likeable but not great. I was mainly attracted to it because I saw that Elizabeth Taylor played in it & I had never seen a movie with a teenage E. Taylor before. I know that this was suppose to be a comedy, (my favorite kind of movie), but I didn't find myself laughing very much. The funniest parts of the movie to me was when Irene Dunn reminded me of Gracie Allen--they both used the same type of reasoning--hilarious! I did not find the character of father very likeable--he was very controlling, a self important man, an insensitive man and a pompous man. Made you wonder how the wife could love such a man. Elizabeth Taylor played a small part but an important part when it came to the oldest son. I can't recommend or not recommend this movie--each person's likes and dislikes are different.",1502064000,,817,4.489932885906041
547173,5,6303079709,"Review of Life With Father
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

I used to wonder why William Powell wasn't cast as the grumpy father in Father of the Bride, since he resembled the novels illustration much more than Spencer Tracy. Maybe he was too likable; maybe he couldn't pull off grumpy and structured, I thought. After watching Life with Father, I stand corrected. William Powell has the market cornered on grumpy and structured. He was even nominated for an Academy Award for this performance!

Before we even see him, the audience is exposed to Bills quirks. The new servant is terrified of making a mistake, since her predecessors usually only last a few days; Irene Dunn walks her through whats expected. The coffee must be piping hot, the muffins must remain in the ceramic container until the last possible moment, the paper must be unwrinkled, the milk gets delivered in a special tin bucket, the stock market must behave itselfand when Bill Powell finally walks onscreen, he corrects the foyer clock according to the time on his pocket watch. He complains constantly, berates the servants, criticizes his wife and children, and is downright hostile at the idea of hosting his wifes cousin at their house. The audience is supposed to think hes a terrible beast, especially when he treats Irene with such little respect as they quibble over the household expenses. I saw through it, as I hope many viewers will. This isn't a gruff, abusive man. This is a man trying to uphold the image of man in a household of four impressionable sons. In the 1800s, man had a very defined role to play. This film shows the difficulties and conflicting emotions involved in maintaining the role.

I really love this movie. The oldest son falls in love with a young and beautiful Elizabeth Taylor, and he tries to emulate his father as he realizes hes turning into a man. But when he tries to be gruff and controlling, it backfires. Why cant he act as manly as his father does? The truth: because underneath his exterior, William Powell isn't gruff. He loves his wife more than anything in the world. It really is a touching story.

One aspect of the movie might turn some viewers off, but I urge you to keep watching. Bill and Irene constantly argue about religion, and if you're not religious, you might brush the movie off as a God movie. Just replace it with any other argument in your mind and keep watching the movie. The argument isn't about God, its about the give and take between husband and wife.

Give Life with Father a try. I highly recommend it. And if you like period pieces, its an excellent portrayal of life in the 1890s. It was nominated for set design and music Oscars, but I think Marjorie Bests costume design should have been honored. The dresses are incredibly beautiful!",1500422400,2,2783,4.694672131147541

547275,4,6303079709,"This is a review for the 'Moving Picture Archive' version DVD only. I had seen various versions on DVD and on the internet that are downright horrible quality, terrible color, sound bad picture and sound, all the way around. the 'Moving Picture Archive' version DVD is the best quality picture and sound & color I have seen of this film so far. This includes on DVD or free video streaming on YouTube. This film fell into public domain in 1975.  Warner Brothers have let the copyright lapse, as of 1975 for 'Life With Father'. That means anybody who wants to put it on DVD or on the internet can do so for free and also make money from the sales of the film on DVD and potentially via online streaming. The 'Moving Picture Archive' has at least made an effort to bring at least decent quality print to DVD at a reasonable price. The sound and picture are good, I would rate them as A+, considering the horrible prints of this film that are circulating out there. The color is as good as I have seen for his film. I would rate the color as A-. It was filmed in Technicolor in 1947. The color may be fairly close to the original film. I would love to see a real Technicolor print, remastered and reissued by Warner Bros. I know they still own the master print of this film. Their TV channel, Turner Classic Movies has shown this film at least once a year on Father's Day for years. They, of course, show a nice, clean copy. That means that this film DOES exist in a cleaned up form, via Warner Bros.! WHY do they not reissue it for DVD or Blu-Ray? How about even just for streaming? The film has a great cast and is well written, script taken from a hit Broadway play. It is a beautifully shot film.

Because of the film falling into the public domain ( one source says it was never copyrighted in the first place ), we have been subject to many inferior prints of the film over the years.

547599,5,6303079709,"It seems to happen every so often that an era develops a sudden affection for an earlier era that is distant enough to be portrayed in totally affectionate terms. In the Forties and early Fifties it was the Turn of the Century, roughly from 1880 to 1915. Many movies were made like  I Remember Mama and Meet Me In St. Louis that portrayed what was by then seen as a less complicated and more innocent era in a nostalgic light. Life With Father was one of the most popular of these.

The screenplay and the long-running  play on which it was based were both adapted from Clarence Day Jr.'s autobiographical novel of the same title. It became Day's most famous work not only being a best-seller but running eight years on Broadway, setting a record run for a non-musical. Day was also known as a cartoonist, mainly for his cartoons in support of Women's Suffrage.. The book is a humorous and satirical look back to 1880's New York and his upbringing in a wealthy Episcopalian family with a domineering stockbroker father who wanted to run the family like a business. Day was interested in depicting how old Victorian ideas had changed in the Twentieth Century. The book and film are mostly episodic, but basically revolve around the wife's attempts to have him baptized once he lets it slip that his freethinking parents never had it done.

Though usually looked upon as a funny and sweet comedy, it has become rather controversial lately, likely by a younger audience who don't know much about the Victorian and prior ages and the old figure of the paterfamilias. They tend to find Mr. Clarence Day Sr.'s personality so abrasive, domineering, patriarchal and rude that they cannot accept the film or the character as portrayed by William Powell. First of all they need to remember that this is a comedy and that the character, based on the author's own father, has been blown up and exaggerated into an almost cartoonish figure for the sake of comedy, a long-standing fictional device.  He, in all his self absorbed pomposity, is funny every time he steps into a scene just by virtue of being who he is.

Secondly one has to understand that beneath the comic exaggeration runs a thread of satire that people in the 40's would have understood better because many of them would have remembered it. In the Victorian Era and most of history before it, the paterfamilias was a truly fearsome character. He ran the home and family as an absolute monarch and was the sole judge and jury in all instances that pertained to family life. In Classical Civilization he had the power to condemn members of the family to death and accept or reject children. He was most often the only source of income and very often wives referred to their husbands as ""Mister"" with the last name rather than call him by his first name. Prospective suitors had to make arrangements through him and not just with a daughter. In earlier days he determined the careers of his sons. Many of these men, even as late as the Victorian Era were distant and aloof figures in a family who mostly kept to themselves and only occasionally interacted with their children. This is historical fact and not debatable. It's just how it was.

A great deal of the comedy in Life With Father revolves around the fact that even in 1885 this concept of fatherhood is already crumbling and by the 1940's was completely outdated, but Powell's Mr. Day keeps trying to assert the role. Yet every time he declares, ""I won't allow it!"" you know he's going to give in before long. That's the gist of the whole thing, to show how outmoded this character had become and how much better things were after a few decades had intervened. It's also important to note that this seeming ogre of a man loves his wife and children dearly, shows great concern for them and does everything h can for them.

The cast is absolutely superb in their roles, working really well as an ensemble. Irene Dunne is quite funny as Vinnie, the mother, even though she didn't like the character for being rattle-headed (The mother role is also blown up for comic effect almost into ma Gracie Allen-type). The two older sons are well-played by the then popular Jimmy Lydon (who was film's Henry Aldrich) as Clarence Jr. and a teenage Martin Milner (later of Route 66 and Adam-12) is second oldest, John. Zasu Pitts is sweet Aunt Clara and Edmund Gwenn (Kris Kringle in Miracle On 34th Street) is Reverend Lloyd. A young Elizabeth Taylor is cousin Mary.

This movie is delightful and funny if you take it in the right way and is very much worth seeing. It went into the Public Domain in the 60's and during the video and DVD era many horrible copies were made by cut-rate companies. Amazon streams a completely restored version in its true original Technicolor and is far preferable to almost any hardcopy you could buy.",1484352000,9,4831,4.6541617819460726

547815,5,6303079709,"I am a movie collector/historian, with thousands of titles in my library, dating back to 1914, and I consider this MASTERPIECE, Life With Father(1947), the best film ever made.

First of all, the story, was an autobiography by Clarence Day Jr.(1935). It was made into a play in 1939. ""The 1939 Broadway production ran for over seven years to become the longest-running non-musical play on Broadway, a record that it still holds. It also held the title of the longest running Broadway play of any type of all time from 1947 to 1972.""

When the play was made into a movie, in 1947, it garnished 6 Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Actor, William Powell.

Apart from all this, this movie is a sheer delight, dealing with the simple fact, that Clarence Day, the patriarch of the family, has never been baptized, but, much more important than this, this autobiographical story, shows us what life was like in a middle class family in New York city, circa 1880. Masterful director, Michael Curtiz, juggles religion, and a near death sickness, with romance, family life, and mingles it all with a joyful comedy of manners. William Powell, and Irene Dunne are flawless, Edmund Gwenn(Miracle on 34th Street), and Zasu Pitts, are fabulous as supporting players, and ingenue, Elizabeth Taylor is exquisite in this role that took her from children parts to young adult. All in all, this movie should be watched every Father's Day, in remembrance of what Hollywood once achieved in it's Golden Age.",1479340800,,1501,4.9015748031496065

For our times, the father's patriarchal attitude to the point of tyranny, the stereotypical view of women as devoid of reason, are so extreme as to be more comical than offensive.

Also, the trailer which accompanies this page IS NOT FROM THE REMEMBER WHEN CLASSIC MOVIE VERSION.  I know and am convinced that you will love and keep forever the Remember When Classic Movie version of this unforgettable film! One of the best films ever made! Excellent, nostalgic film based on a Victorian family and their odd, eccentric, but lovable and topsy-turvy life. Beautifully restored version - best I've ever seen. I have added some stills taken from the DVD.
Love the picture quality, audio - everything about this film - really cinema quality. Reminds us of a time and place when life was simpler, sweeter, and certainly more innocent. A joy to watch

This film is witty, sad, and hysterically funny in parts. The film is a slice of history; a look into the lives of what a real American family was like, but sadly will probably never be again. At least we can watch this film frequently to remind us all of how good times were way back when......

549097,5,6303079709,"To watch ""Life with Father"" is a nostalgic trip down memory lane, not because it is set in New York in the 1880s before electricity and autos, but because recall seeing it long ago in first run when I was quite young.  In high school, our drama teacher wanted to produce it as the Senior Play, me playing the father, but hesitated because in the original script there are so many ""damns"" and ""damnations""  This is is sad, sad too that the expletives couldn't be used in the film.  So wonderful that original last line when the father is finally coaxed into getting baptized by his wife (William Powell and Irene Dune are terrific), and the cop on the beat asks him, ""Where are you going?"" and he answers, ""I'm going to be baptized, damn it!""  A very young Elizabeth Taylor also in the film, as beautiful as ever.  Whether you go in for nostalgia or not, this is a really delightful viewing experience, highly recommended.",1449100800,3,921,4.524096385542169

When it was shot you can tell they took every step necessary to make the costumes, the sets, everything so authentic you actually feel as if you're back in 1890s New York.  The scene with Irene Dunne and William Powell gently singing together is so incredibly poignant it can bring tears to your eyes.  All the actors were what truly what a great actor should be.  Far better than some of the things you see in movies today with actresses showing up at the Oscars wearing nothing more than a flimsy handkerchief they call a dress.

An unsurpassed cast brings it to life with William Powell at his absolute best playing, 'Father'. Irene Dunne supports him along with an unusually good cast:
Edmund Gwen, a teenage Elizabeth Taylor and Zazu Pitts, no less. This is a laugh out-loud film, and smiles when you are not laughing.
The video I had was perfect, color sound - everything all clarity and lovely - like watching it in a theater. The DVD, however, was SUCH a disappointment and angered me no end. I believe prints such as those are why a great deal of younger people to not enjoy the classics. They believe them all inferior, when in fact most are superior, whether black & white or the incredible early, Technicolor.

551030,5,6303079709,"I've seen this movie several times and was happy to see it available on DVD.  It's about a family whose life revolves around the husband/father, who is extremely picky about every little thing.  They go through a new maid about 4 times a week because he's always yelling at them or yelling in general and everyone's terrified of him except his wife.  She's slightly air-headed, but still in control and she runs the household, even though he thinks he does.  You'll see some familiar faces (Martin Milner is one of the sons and a young Elizabeth Taylor plays a guest who charms another son) and some that aren't.  There's a funny scene where the wife tries to explain to her husband that they don't owe anything for the son's new suit and another where she worries that her marriage isn't legitimate since her husband hasn't been baptized.  Young people won't like this, probably, unless they like old movies, and there's no fast action, sex, crime or the other things people like so much in today's movies, but it's still an enjoyable movie if you like the genre.",1409702400,2,1064,4.663101604278075

551115,3,6303079709,"I like to consider myself a fan of William Powell and in the 6 or 8 films of his that I've seen, I've always been impressed.  While Powell and his co-stars (including a 15 year old Elizabeth Taylor) are excellent, I struggled with the movie.  Usually I'm able to relate to the era portrayed in film but admittedly I found little funny with the family patriarch, Clarence Sr. (Powell) bellowing about and at his wife Vinnie (Irene Dunne) and his 4 children.  Yeah, I know the setting is 1885.

The undercurrent to the story is that Wall Street kingpin ""Clare"" is constantly being hoodwinked by Vinnie.  She plays dumb, but she's just doing what she has to in order to get her way, or the needs of the kids.  Taylor plays Mary, a travelling companion of Vinnie's cousin Mary (Zasu Pitts).  She becomes a romantic interest for the family's oldest son Clarence, Jr. (Jimmy Lydon) who has yet to learn much about the ""birds and the bees.""  When Clare is given the opportunity to give his son some advice about women, he essentially tells him to keep them in their place.  Aside from my personal inclinations to the material, I found the film often boring with little to chuckle about.

I will also note that this particular DVD (Alpha Video 2002) is technically horrible.  The color is washed out.  There are numerous instances of video noise and artifacts.  It appears to have been copied from a VHS tape.  Even if you like the movie be forewarned.",1408665600,,1444,4.58984375

True- it is a time that the reigning socialist elites have condemned, but take the movie for what it is: a fabulous story about a well to do NYC banker who runs his house very efficiently. Hilarious movie, and although this is not a Blu-ray version, it is still very well done. Give it a shot. If you don't like it, you can always donate it to your neighborhood library.

There was very little relief from the aggressive nature of Powell's character.  He maintained a strong household and loved his wife and children but ruled the roost too harshly.  He did give in to his wife but he could have saved her and the audience a lot of nervous tension by being more agreeable towards her without having to constantly prove his superiority so loudly.

All in all a worthwhile movie for the social historical aspect. The setting, costumes, and a young Elizabeth Taylor were very engaging.",1395014400,,776,4.907692307692308

Both LIFE WITH FATHER and FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND have been in the public domain since the beginning of the home video era. Unless they're original studio releases, most DVD manufacturers issue these in unrestored form, often from well-used 16 mm stock or even copies of previous videotapes. If pristine image is not critical, these budget-priced discs are adequate. With rare exception, bonus features are non-existent and in the case of classic era movies, full screen format is the rule.

Michael Curtiz's LIFE WITH FATHER is based on a memoir written by Clarence Day Jr. and on the Lindsay/Crouse stageplay. This fin de sicle tale concerns the domestic adventures of a somewhat uptight businessman (Powell), his slightly neurotic wife (Dunne) and their four mischievous children.

Vincente Minnelli's comedy, FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is the sequel to BRINGING UP FATHER. Here, Stanley Banks (Tracy) has trouble coping with the idea that he'll soon be a grandfather.

Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll ratings.

DON'T BE FOOLED INTO CONFUSING THIS BEAUTIFUL VERSION OF THIS FILM WITH A CHEAP, LOUSY VERSION DISTRIBUTED BY SOMEONE ELSE. JUST HAVE TO MAKE THIS CLEAR! WE PRODUCE QUALITY FILMS AND DOCUMENTARIES HERE, NOT GARGABE!!!!! Excellent, nostalgic film based on a turn-of-the-century family and their odd, eccentric, but lovable and topsy-turvy life. Beautifully restored version - best I've ever seen.

Love the picture quality, audio - everything about this film - really cinema quality. Reminds us of a time and place when life was simpler, sweeter, and certainly more innocent.

I watch this film over and over again. It's witty, sad, and hysterically funny in parts. This film is a slice of history; a look into the lives of what a real American family was like, but sadly will probably never be again. At least we can view this film frequently to remind us all of how good times were way back when......

If you purchase any version of this film, be sure to get the Digicom TV version or the Moving Picture Archive release - they are both equally great! You will not be disappointed.",1374364800,2,1662,4.971223021582734
552101,1,6303079709,"Babies cannot be baptized because they are not old enough to be held accountable for their own sins yet. They may be dedicated to the LORD by their parents and elders, but one must be of an age of accountability and thereby old enough in mind and have knowledge of the grace and gift of salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ, and what He did in dying on the cross, and being raised again on the third day to redeem us, in order to confess with ones mouth and ask forgiveness for ones sins.
That is what brings one into the saving grace of Jesus Christ and gets one into heaven.
Being baptized is a public experience that says to everyone that is watching, ""I am a child of God and I will follow Jesus Christ.""
The sprinkling of water does nothing, one must be taken under the water as this is what takes one into the depths of death covered by the water, as Jesus was covered in the tomb, and when we are raised again up from the water it is as Jesus was raised again up from the tomb by God the Father on the third morning.

This is what being baptized is all about.

This movie contains so many untruths it makes a mockery of God's Word and I would only hope that people will turn away from this movie and other media like it and turn to the Bible for biblical truths.

552592,1,6303079709,"Life With Father, 1947 film

The story begins with a view of the Brooklyn Bridge, an engineering marvel of that era (built while William Marcy Tweed was mayor of New York city). One picture shows a steam water pump pulled by a three-horse team; it provided pressurized water for fighting fires. Other pictures show life in the New York streets. [Note the dirt street of Madison Avenue.] A milkman delivers milk by pouring it into the customer's container. A dumbwaiter brings food from the cellar kitchen to an upper floor. We meet the family. A father's old suit is cut down to fit his oldest son. Why do they have a turnover in maids? ""I know what you'll like or not like."" Household accounts keep track of expenses. Would a charge account be better? Mr. Day complains about taxes, again. Is there a misunderstanding? [Why is he so unaware?]

Mrs. Day gets a visit from relatives. Clarence Jr. plays a violin. Clarence Sr. hires another maid. Will he pay $5,000 for a new pew? His old one lost value. Is he cranky? Same words, different tune? The family dines at Delmonicos. Was Clarence Sr. ever baptized? No? The air vents carry the conversation upstairs. The Episcopalian minister talks about the need for Baptism for salvation. We learn about kneeling in church for Episcopalians and Methodists. Clarry and Mary talk on the back porch. Clarry wants a new suit. His father tells him about women. ""Don't let them get you stirred up!"" ""Be firm."" Clarence Sr. wants a high tariff to protect America against cheap foreign labor. [No mention of businesses.] An argument over money? Its for her own good. The two young sons argue over Father's status. Will his comments upset his wife Vinnie again? The boys get a job selling a patent medicine. How good is it? Clarence is summoned from his office, his wife is sick.

Whitney studies for his Confirmation. Mrs. Day is seriously ill, the Minister is called. Doctors made house calls then. Will Clarence accept Baptism? Or kneel and pray? After Vinnie recovers she goes shopping. [We see a clothing store from the 1880s.] ""Genuine imitation Dresden."" ""It's not the price, it's the money."" Clarence gave his word to be baptized. ""I didn't pay anything for it, I charged it."" The ceramic dog goes back in exchange for the new suit. ""What have I done now?"" Mrs. Day explains why the suit cost nothing - it was exchanged for the ceramic dog! Those relatives return for another visit. The cab will take them all to the church for Baptism. Or will it?

This movie was adapted from a Broadway stage play and a book. It tells you what was popular in the 1940s (the attitudes). Is it still funny and amusing? Not for me. There was a about a minute of speech censored from young Clarence. This movie was originally in Technicolor, not monochrome.",1357603200,,2783,4.6850715746421265

552819,3,6303079709,"William Powell plays Clarence Day, a stock broker who lives in New York City in the 1880s. He's the son of freethinkers, and although he goes to church (Episcopalian), he has never been baptized. He's a bit of a martinet, but he loves his wife (Irene Dunn) and his four sons: Clarence, Jr., John, Whitney and Harlan. He believes he is master of his household, but his wife manipulates him in a hundred ways.

A very young Elizabeth Taylor plays Mary Skinner, a visitor who came with Cousin Cora (Zazu Pitts) and promptly bewitched Clarence, Junior. But young Clarence is wearing a cut-down suit of his father's, and can't seem to make it do anything his father would not do. Like kneel in church, or accept Mary sitting on his lap.

Young Clarence and John go to work selling patent medicine, and decide to test it on their mother, who was not feeling well. Indeed, she almost died of poison (although that was not known at the time). While she was very sick, Clarence, Senior, agreed to be baptized as a sort of bribe to God.

I know it's funny, in a way, but it made me cringe to hear little Harlan ask Whitney whether Father was going to go to hell because he was not baptized, and Whitney hamming it up with burning for a thousand years and frightening the poor little kid half out of his wits. In the end, of course, Mrs. Day manipulates her poor husband into submitting to baptism.

The father of a middle-class family in New York in 1883 budgets his money; walking to work at a bank; though he could afford a horse drawn cab. His wife is not so careful about spending money.

I was not interested in this as kid, because it has a lot of subtle humor that I did not catch. The young man attends an Episcopal church, and asks the girl, ""Do you Methodists kneel in church?"" She replies, ""We don't go up and down as much, but we stay down longer.""

Manhattan) shows that there are certain constants about family life even after more than a century.  In 1883 the Day family--stockbroker Clarence Sr. (William Powell), known to most of his intimates as Clare; his wife Vinnie (Irene Dunne); and sons Clarence Jr. (Jimmy Lydon), almost 18, John (Martin Milner), 14, Whitney (Johnny Calkins), 10, and six-year-old Harlan (Derek Scott)--lives a comfortable upper-class life in a brownstone house at 420 Madison Avenue, where ""Father"" definitely rules the roost, or at least tries to.  But the servant problem, a loveably scatterbrained and financially hopeless wife, and four boys with redheaded high spirits make life a lot more difficult than he'd prefer.  When Vinnie's Cousin Cora (Zasu Pitts) and a young friend, 15-year-old Mary Skinner (Elizabeth Taylor), come to visit, a revelation ensues that shocks the devout Vinnie: Clarence has never been baptized!  Will he ever get to Heaven?  Is she really married to him?  Are her sons (horrors!) even legitimate?  Vinnie resolves to get her husband to the font come hell or high water.  Meanwhile young Clarence is suffering the pangs of first love, which he tries to deal with as he thinks his father would (a situation complicated by the inexplicable fact that his new suit, cut down from one of Clarence Sr.'s, seems disinclined to ""do anything that Father wouldn't do,"" including kneel to a girl or let her sit on his lap); John, eager to earn some extra spending money, is given ""the whole territory of Manhattan"" in which to sell a patent medicine that proves a good deal less virtuous than its advertising suggests; Whitney struggles with his catechism, and Harlan with issues like oatmeal (which he hates) and the prospect of being kissed by girls (which is even worse).  Clare and Vinnie don't seem to share a bedroom, yet it's obvious that they love each other dearly and have ever since their marriage 20 years ago; Vinnie is constantly trying to soothe Clare's outbreaks of temper, and Clare, when Vinnie becomes mysteriously ill, is utterly lost without her.  And while the four boys may behave much more formally than youngsters of today, they're still recognizably red-blooded American lads: girls and money interest the older ones, and though he may have to do it in a short-pants sailor suit ornamented with soutache, Whitney is so eager to pitch that he bolts his breakfast shamefully.  At the center of it all is Father, played so masterfully by Powell that he should have been awarded the Oscar (he *was* among the finalists).

552991,5,6303079709,"People...PLEASE understand...this is digitally REMASTERED NOT RESTORED.  Consider yourself fortunate to have a copy even this good when you consider WARNER ENTERTAINMENT has turned their backs on this wonderful old classic.  WARNER ENTERTAINMENT has no interest in ever making this title available from their own original negatives which is so unfortunate.  This title fell into public domain and because of that WARNER apparently feel it has no commercial value.  Under the circumstances we have to just be thankful that any company is at least willing to find a good, clean copy and attempt to remaster it.

Please remember the difference.  A RESTORED movie is one that come from the original negative or good working print and every single frame (16 to each minute so some nearly 2,000 frames for the full movie)and clean up dirt, scratches, rips, etc and attempt to restore it to it original beauty. This process is extremely costly.  In fact, in some circumstances restoration can cost as much as the original movie production.  It is just not an expense anyone but a major studio could afford.

A REMASTERED movie is when a company can locate a good print and try to clean up that print the best they can.  Because it is a print and not a negative it is nearly impossible to do much better then what we see in LIFE WITH FATHER.  But it is apparent that they did locate a very nice, clean print.  This copy is far superior to any copy previously available to the public.

You can't compare this to the TV prints.  Keep in mind that WARNER still holds on to the TV released prints and there they are working with original negatives (the same negatives and prints that WARNER does not wish to release to the general public which is so very upsetting....but then WARNER is the worst studio for turning its backs on the collectors).

And disregard the collector who complained about the story content.  This is not a dull, boring story.  It came from what in 1946 was at the time the longest running non musical Broadway play.  It is based on a true life story and is a beautiful example of the life in a much softer life.  We rarely get glimpses of early America in movies today and it is a treasure to be able to view that time in a movie that was produced when people from that era were still alive and able to recreate what to them were memories.  We may never see the likes of this again.",1287446400,88,2394,4.575117370892019

553053,5,6303079709,"It astonishes me that Life With Father no longer has the same degree of popularity as other Hollywood films of the Forties that tell similar stories of family life in late 19th-Century America. This was one of the best of the Greatest Generation's stiffly satirical looks at its own elders, which had been filmed so sweetly in Meet Me in St. Louis, for example. The original Life With Father was a huge and much-honored Broadway hit, and the play was also adapted for a well-executed television series in the 1950s.

But this funny and very gentle portrait of a large middle-class family in New York City circa 1880, a major Warner Bros. release at the time (1947), has been sorely neglected on video. Until now not even a watchable transfer existed. The comedy, one of Jack Warner's casualities-by-neglect, fell through cracks into the public domain, and as such has never been restored. This from the same studio executive who later outbid all others for the similar-in-feel The Music Man, now much honored on disc, including Blu-ray.

The story is almost a catalog of 19th-century obsessions, with a twentieth-century bite. It is a recounting of one family's cranky, overbearing and semi-oblivious father, a straight-arrow businessman who is firmly convinced he will never need to be baptized into his wife's church. When he finally gets up to Heaven, by God, he'll just have a good talk with them and set them straight! Such shocking disregard for convention and his wife's devout beliefs sets off a family crisis, as Mother and her brood take a stand against this tyrannical but ultimately lovable man of the house.

The film has standout performances by at least three huge stars--William Powell, Irene Dunne, and a very young Elizabeth Taylor. Supporting roles are near-perfect, including a rare appearance by Zazu Pitts in an iconic role as a fluttery aunt. The excellent dialog has just enough hilarity and bite to remain tasty, even though the complications are, despite the life-after-death stakes, relatively trivial to us today.

If you've seen it, you may wonder if this newer transfer is superior to previous VHS copies, and the answer is a qualified yes. The video image is surprisingly richer and more colorful than the poorly produced tapes of  the past, but it's hardly up to Warners' current standards. If you watch your films on a TV set with a ""cinema"" or ""theater"" picture mode (which is much warmer and less blue than ""standard"" mode) the image will appear quite dark and lacking in contrast. Switching to a brighter mode, however, restores some luster and the picture is far more enjoyable. That's not something I'd normally endorse.

But the play's the thing, and I'd like everyone to see this film at least once. Finally here is a very inexpensive disc that offers a hint of what the fuss about Life With Father was all about.",1274572800,4,2853,4.89648033126294

The DVD on our 32 inch plasma set looks like a live television picture rather than a movie. In addition to fixing the color and sound, every little tiny speck of scratch and dust and whatever is gone, and there is zero left/right movement back and forth as a film looks like going through a projector.

553184,2,6303079709,"The washed out visuals wouldn't be so hard to take if that were the sole problem.  The faded quality sort of adds to the period look in a perverse way.  (Which is not to say I still wouldn't prefer to see it restored to glorious technicolor).  The sound quality is intolerable however.  I can put up with a lot but not sound this muddy.  The only reason I sat through it was because I was watching it relatively late at night and was just too tired to get up and turn it off (and had misplaced the remote).

I've always enjoyed William Powell, who stars as the curmudgeonly late 19th century patriarch, Clarence Day, Sr..  And Irene Dunne, as his exuberant wife Vinnie--just radiates class and charm--even when playing a character who could be a bit of a ditz.  In point of fact, she brings a kind of level-headedness to her character's ditziness that makes it all her more appealing.  She's dumb as a fox really, and can wrap her irascible husband right around her finger.

A very young Elizabeth Taylor appears as the Day family's houseguest--the traveling companion of Mr. Day's cousin Cora (ZaSu Pitts).  She's quite good in this (from what I can hear), as the eldest Day boy's first major crush.  That boy, Clarence Day, Jr., grew up to be the author of the memoir upon which the play and subsequent film were based.  So it's rooted in fact, even if (likely) gussied up a bit for stage and screen.

But here's one little plot twist I couldn't quite gloss over.  Two of the sons, Clarence and John, Jr., are apparently responsible for the accidental poisoning of their mother.  They've been peddling some quack's nostrum throughout the city and have apparently decided to use their (mildly) ailing mother as a guinea pig--and this in an era before they even used guinea pigs as guinea pigs.

Mother becomes violenlty ill and there's talk that they may lose her.  She does recover, perhaps in part, because her unbaptized husband agrees that he will finally subject himself to that rite and help guarantee that she will someday see him in Heaven.  OK, so maybe she wasn't suffering from a sickness unto death, after all.  Who knows?  This is the Hollywood version, after all.  Still, all of this comes to light on the very morning that Mr. Day agrees to be baptized.  Young John, the boy entrepreneur, admits his transgression when it's revealed that a dose of his medicine has killed a neighbor's dog.

Mr. Day's insistence that young John go out and refund every last customer to whom the lad has sold a bottle for once seems like a very rational (and not just curmudgeonly) demand.  If the stuff killed a dog and sickened Mrs. Day, then whatever the 19th century version of a recall is called, seems more than appropriate.  Time was a-wastin', in fact.  But Mom's priority is Dad's baptism.  And that, my friends, makes no sense given the potential consequences of that quacksilver's being out in the world.

Yeah, I know.  Don't think too much! It's never a good idea.  The book was probably different anyway.  Still as ditzy as Mom could be and as much as Dad's crotchitiness could get in the way of clear thinking, you gotta wonder what was going on in their collective noggins on that fine morning.",1243123200,,3208,4.623008849557523

The geniusness of the ditsy mother is allowing the father to believe that he is running the family.  The overall feeling of this film is one of warmth and humor as we follow the intimate details of this family as they go about thier daily routine.

553258,3,6303079709,"THE GOOD - This film has ""charm"" written all over it. Although Irene Dunne has some Gracie Allen-type gag lines, William Powell is the one who provides most of the laughs in this tale of upper-crust family life in the 1880s. However, both Powell and Dunne are excellent and play off each other well.

 The story revolves around the personal and business life of the Clarence Day family, a true family in the sense of the word it, which is nice to see. Every character is interesting and the supporting cast includes Edmund Gwenn and Zasu Pitts (love that name!). The Technicolor is nice, too. All in all, it's a nice period piece that takes you back life a little over a century ago, and provides us another one of these more-innocent family stories.

THE BAD  - The romance between Jimmy Lydon and a young Elizabeth Taylor gets a little sappy. Powell's constant exclamation ""Gad!"" is very annoying as a close as screenwriters apparently could get to saying ""God"" all the time in 1947.

THE UGLY - To my knowledge, there has never been a good print made of this, either on tape or DVD, which includes this DVD.  Why is this? Considering the cast and good reputation of this movie, to have one poor transfer after another of it is a disgrace!",1236729600,2,1241,4.542600896860987
553259,5,6303079709,"William Powell is superb in this magnificent version of 'Life with Father'. Irene Dunne - only slightly less so.

This film was made at a time when people went to the cinema to be entertained - and to come away from the show feeling 'good' about themselves and the world around them.

Some might sneer and call this film 'escapism' - and it might well be. I only know that entertainment, such as this film provides, is a joy to watch. It is, also, a reminder of an age when human decency was commonly displayed.

At no stage of civilised life, has living been perfect - nor has happiness and wealth been 'universally enjoyed'. Nevertheless there were once much better times, for very many people, than presently exist in this 'dog eat dog', selfish and avaricious world of the twenty-first century.  This time is joyfully recalled by the superb acting of Powell and Dunne - ably assisted by excellent directing.

553323,4,6303079709,"Life with father is, a true story and I can vouch for it being just like real life, at least life with a father like mine, {born in 1919}.
Like Vinnie, in the movie, my mother always got what she wanted too, and my father was always fussing about it, just like Mr. Clarence Day, and to hear him tell his eldest son about women, when he first notices his son taking an interest in girls, or rather in a girl, was just like hearing my father tell my brother about women!
It is so true to real life, at least, like I said, in my home, that I just about died laughing! Interestingly, it was so well done that my father, who was watching it with me, really enjoyed it as well!
Of course his wife, my mother, died at a young{compared to my father's 89 years}62, so perhaps in missing her he sees the story in a different light.
The sweet way in which they show the love between Clarence and his wife, Vinny, is so beautiful, and really touching, I highly recommend the story, the only reason why I didn't put five stars is because of the picture quality and sound, but it is not as bad as others, who are not as used to old movies as I am, would lead you to believe.
I really do not know if they can reproduce it any better, perhaps with some they can only do the best they can, but looking back I can't see it as a problem at all, we are just so used to everything these days being so richly textured, the story itself is so well done that you really don't notice anything else but the pure joy of the interplay between the characters and the rich dialog!
Highly Reccomended and just...thank you, Hollywood, for putting it out on DVD!
Irene Dunne was wonderful as the mother, as always! And even the children handle their parts excellently, there really isn't a boring character in the whole lot!
The mother may always get her way in the end, but she isn't perfect either, and that is brought out in her lack of understanding money. It is beautiful how they show so well the strengths and weaknesses of both mother and father, and how they work together,like the lock and the key, or are trying to get along amid each others differences, it is touching and amusing all at once.
Every woman could learn a lesson by watching Vinnie, she is a role model for the fascinating woman, or a woman striving to be more true to the way God, or nature, fitted us to be, to bless our men, {helping them over their weaknesses at the same time letting them believe we did nothing of the kind}!

But probably more distracting and annoying is the reverse in some of the scenes - for instance, the stairwell in the opening early scene -- looking towards the stairwell from the entrance, the railing is on the right and the wall is on the left; so if someone is coming down the steps the railing will be to their left, but in the next scene when Vinnie comes down the stairs, the railing is on her right, and as she walks into the dining room,  the background image shows the stairwell railing is now on the left again.

553392,4,6303079709,"This movie is about a middle class family set in 1880s New York. The controlling figure is Clarence (Claire) Day, Sr. (William Powell), a Wall Street broker, who expects his family members to live according to his impossible standards. Author Clarence Day wrote this story in 1936 about his family life in New York in New Yorker magazine, and it was first used for a non-musical Broadway show which ran for seven successful years. In 1947, this story was written for the movie starring William Powell and Irene Dunn. This is essentially a character study of a man who runs his family like an investment firm of Wall Street. He is a penny pincher, cautious about money; evaluate religious and spiritual matters with the mind of a financial analyst with no room for mistakes. His advice to his son about romantic matters is shrewd. His beautiful wife Vinnie (Irene Dunn) is understanding, patient, and firm in her beliefs, which includes that her husband is essentially good man who has to be baptized. She persists in her beliefs, and prevails in her style of mothering three sons in spite of her husband's constant annoying behavior. Irene Dunn offers a great performance as a spiritual wife who does her best, and succeeds in convincing her husband's attitude towards faith. Elizabeth Taylor shines as a young girl visiting Days as a house guest with whom the eldest son develops a romantic interest. William Powell was honored with a nod from Academy in the category of best actor in 1947. The movie offers a contrasting view of a family life in 1880s; a conservative time when political correctness was not in the horizon.",1188259200,2,1625,4.827956989247312

553464,5,6303079709,"As an adult, Clarence Day Jr. (1874-1935) joined his well-known father on Wall Street--but developed a form of arthritis that left him a semi-invalid.  Shortly before his death he published LIFE WITH FATHER, a humorous memoir of his Victorian childhood; sadly, he did not live to see its great success.  A best seller, the novel was adapted to the stage in 1939 by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse.  Warner Bro.s bought the film rights, agreeing to wait until the show finished its Broadway run; as it happened the studio had a long wait, for the play went on to become one of Broadway's longest running shows, playing almost eight years.

In acquiring the rights, Warner Bro.s also gave Clarence Day's widow and playwrights Lindsay and Crouse substantial power over the film version.  Censorship issues of the day prevented an absolute translation of the script to the screen, but on the whole the script survived the transformation extremely well, and fueled by a host of flawless performances and remarkably fine production values LIFE WITH FATHER became as memorable on screen as it was on stage.

Clarence Day is an eccentric man, absolutely certain that he alone is correct in all decisions, and eternally running afoul of wife Vinnie's scatterbrained logic, his four sons, visiting relatives, and terrified servants.  When a conversation reveals that he has never been baptised, Mr. Day laughs the matter off--but Vinnie is determined that he will be baptised whether he likes it or not.  Comic battlelines are drawn, and the result is a hilariously amusing portrait of Victorian manners and attitudes about everything from religion to the place of women in the world.

The performances are superlative.  This would prove to be among the last great roles for both William Powell and Irene Dunne, who play Clarence and Vinnie Day, and to describe their work as flawless is actually an understatement: we completely believe in them from start to finish.  The same is true of the cast in general, which includes a remarkably beautiful Elizabeth Taylor; legendary comic ZaSu Pitt; and even a very young Martin Milner.  The costuming and sets also capture the look and feel of the era in remarkable fashion.  The film is perfectly executed from start to finish.

But you might as well throw your money away than buy any of the releases presently available on VHS and DVD.  There is not a one of them worth a dime: the color is atrocious, the sound is horrific, and the picture so blurry that the only thing you'll get for your money is a headache--and this has been true of every factory release I've seen to date.

It is a terrible shame that such a fine, indeed such a great film has been so incredibly neglected.  Fortunately for all concerned, LIFE WITH FATHER continues to turn up on television fairly often.  Until there is a restored release, don't buy a VHS or a DVD: tape it from television instead, for I can almost guarantee that the version you find there will be superior.

553467,4,6303079709,"Dad never had a chance in this one. William Powell plays a successful businessman in the New York of the 1880s. He is successful but he is also highly opinionated and domineering. He expects his household to be run just so and pinches the pennies until they scream. His wife, played by Irene Dunne, is nothing like him. She is friendly, gregarious and likes to spend. Her accounting is both creative and ludicrous and a joy to watch. Although he is the screamer, there is no doubt it is she who is in control.

This couple has fours sons, each a bundle of energy and capable of causing plenty of chaos by himself. The youngest is just barely in grammar school and the oldest is just about ready to head off to college. Their chaotically ordinary lives are interrupted when some cousins pass through from out of town. A young and sweet Elizabeth Taylor is one of these cousins and she falls for the oldest son almost as hard as he falls for her. Father's advice on how to handle these matters works about as well on Liz and it does on Irene Dunne. It works not at all.

There are various little plot lines running throughout the story but, mainly, it is about a man who believes he is in control and who is wrapped around the little finger of his wife. When the chips are down, he will do anything for her. There are lots of laughs and a sense of nostalgia running throughout the entire production. It's fun for the entire family.

The movie is great. The DVD leaves something to be desired. The picture quality is fairly fuzzy and the sound has a tendency to dropping out. It is usually restored within a few moments but it can be annoying. It's a shame that such a great film does not have a better vehicle for distribution.",1141948800,10,1725,4.384375
553468,4,6303079709,"I've always liked William Powell films...there always highly entertaining and contain nothing objectionable. Even his mermaid film was okay for children. This film is very clean. It's about upper-middle class family life in New York, 1883. Everything is top-notch. With suberb acting and a delightful musical score.

 See what a lady a young Elizabeth Taylor was!

Only problem is, the video transfer and sound are aweful.

**** 4 Stars! Highly recommended family viewing.",1136764800,3,472,5.424657534246576
553469,4,6303079709,"Life with Father is a classic family comedy.  This is based on the autobiographical play by Clarence Day.  William Powell plays Clarence Day, sr. (Claire), the stern patriarch of the family.  Irene Dunne plays Lavinia Day (Vinnie), the quintessential mother who keeps the family running.  The Days have four sons.

This takes place in Manhattan during a kinder and gentler period (turn of the century) when men were gentlemen and women were ladies.  There is no real storyline, it is just a slice of life.  There are some running storylines including the fact the Father has not been baptized, the visiting of a maiden cousin Cora and a young girl (played by Elizabeth Taylor) and the fact that Mother has no concept of money.

This is a beautiful movie about a bygone period that many would like to see return.  The acting is universally excellent.  In a change of pace from his trademark screwball comedy, Powell is brilliant as the straight man.  Irene Dunne is her usual charming self.  Zasu Pitts is uncharacteristically subdued as cousin Cora.  Elizabeth Taylor has one her few smaller roles that ushers her from child star to ing&eacute;nue and the glimmer of what to come shows through.

The only complaint is the color.  If it did not say that it was shot in Technicolor, you would assume that it was colorized.  Everyone's skin tone is the same and most of the backgrounds are grey.  I feel that the negative has deteriorated over the years and the film has not gone through restoration.  I pulled out my old video of the film and the color is not much better.",1134604800,8,1570,4.688644688644689
553470,5,6303079709,"Clarence Day, played by William Powell, is the man of the house and the king in his own personal castle. He is bombastic and opinionated. His gruff manner and outspokeness scares off parlormaids with regularity. He runs his family and household with a firm hand. At least, he thinks he does. Underneath all that sound and fury beats a soft heart, and wife Vinnie, played by Irene Dunne, knows just how to handle him when she needs to. Equal amounts of psychology and a brand of illogical logic worthy of Gracie Allen can usually achieve the desired end. Powell and Dunne are wonderful together in the classic comedy set in New York City in the 1880's. He is in control one moment and bewildered the next. She is yielding one moment, giving orders the next. The scene where she explains to him why the $15 jacket for Clarence, Jr. didn't actually cost anything is hilarious.

LIFE WITH FATHER is another of those classic movies based on a hit Broadway play. The play, in turn, is based on a book by the real Clarence Day, Jr. I read a short story based on the book when I was a school kid. The story had me laughing so much that I never forgot it. I never saw the play, but the film is certainly no letdown. The sets are lush (these people are upper class, hence the household servants) and the supporting cast is very good. In particular, see a young Elizabeth Taylor as an out-of-town visitor who sparks Clarence Jr.'s interest. The humor is based on witty dialogue and funny situations, and it's a movie the whole family can enjoy. If you appreciate this kind of comedy, LIFE WITH FATHER is definitely for you. It's a personal favorite of mine and a truly excellent film. Give it a try.",1132790400,4,1688,4.48051948051948

Muddy transfer, skipped scenes, heck, my copy even had a big scratch on it.  Here's hoping that Warner Brothers, the film's original distributor, finds it fit to release a proper DVD like it has done with so much of it's back catalog.  As for the film itself, it is pure comic bliss.  William Powell, as the thin-skinned yet lovable father, is just gold here.  One of the great comic performances of all-time, period.  Irene Dunne as the soft-spoken mother is Powell's equal here.  Powell may display all the bluster but in her quietly manipulative way Dunne demonstrates who the real boss of the house is even in pre-suffrage 1888 New York.  The film makes some pointed but humorous observations about the social mores of the day.  A young Liz Taylor is on hand here but her character seems to be something of an afterthought.  Her presence here has probably more to do with her rising starpower than what she can bring to the table.",1128470400,2,1051,4.566844919786096

I wish someone would produce a DVD of this outstanding classic that is worthy of the performances in this delightful and sometimes hilarious through back to a simpler time.

I'm not sure which movie the other reviewer watched, but William Powell plays the father of all BOYS and Elizabeth Taylor plays a young (late teen) family friend infatuated with the oldest son who's headed to Yale in the fall.

William Powell stars as the combustible, but essentially kind and loving patriach of a late 1800's family in New York City.  A wife and three adolescent boys round out this colorful family.
Powell lends irascible charm to his role while Irene Dunne plays the slightly ditsy, well meaning wife marvelously. The supporting cast includes a young and very beautiful Elizabeth Taylor as a flirtatious visitor as well as the future star of the television series ""Adam 12"", Martin Milner, as the middle son.
""Life with Father"" has plenty of warmth and humor to make it well worth seeing.  It just needs a better presentation than in its current DVD format.  Catch it when it airs on television for an optimal viewing experience.",1083110400,6,854,4.909722222222222

The picture isn't all that great- it looks like a fuzzy, poorly-managed colorization process that makes it look kind of ""muddy"".  I really had hoped that the other reviews about the quality were just other production company's poor editing but my copy is the Alpha Video edition that's sold here.

The father character, Mr Day, is an oldfashioned husband who dominates and controls his family absolutely, at least he wants to and he thinks he does. But his attitude is constantly rebutted by his wife, and then his children. And that is were the humor starts. He terrorizes the maids, without even realizing it. He tries to control his wife who is an artist at twirling him around her finger. His own sons implement his principles and that leads to some catastrophes. And of course he is not baptised and that is the recurring element that sounds both phony and hilarious. He wants his household to be run on a business-like basis and this leads to more problems than it solves. It is a perfect film to show how women can control an uncontrolable situation if they know how to use their charms, their backmail at times and their illogical logic that stands upside down and is totally unanswerable. The actors are perfect for the parts and their acting is admirable. It is the taming of the shrew upside down and it becomes the taming of the tamer by the shrew, or just plainly the mother or the woman. A funny and good film for some entertainment and some questioning of father-power. A young Elizabeth Taylor is already showing her potential in the film and we can imagine what she will become in a few years.

Father is a truculent sort of fellow in a celluloid collar and handlebar moustache, who rages away at the slightest provocation, while mother Irene Dunne gives a touch of a Gracie Allen performance as she smoothes out all the situational wrinkles he makes. One of the big surprises in the movie is when two female visitors descend upon Father's house, much to his consternation, and we find that the younger of the two is none other than Elizabeth Taylor, who wastes no time in making eyes at soon-to-be college man, Jimmy Lydon. This little romance inadvertently yields the main plot of the movie, as young Liz innocently makes conversation about baptism, and it is discovered that William Powell never quite got around to taking the plunge. So begins the campaign to get her husband baptized launched by Irene Dunne with a little help from minister Edmund Gwenn, with complications along the way concerning a patent medicine.

His gruff manner and outspokeness scares off parlormaids with regularity. He runs his family and household with a firm hand. At least, he thinks he does. Underneath all that sound and fury beats a soft heart, and wife Vinnie, played by Irene Dunne, knows just how to handle him when she needs to. Equal amounts of psychology and a brand of illogical logic worthy of Gracie Allen can usually achieve the desired end. Powell and Dunne are wonderful together in the classic comedy set in New York City in the 1880's. He is in control one moment and bewildered the next. She is yielding one moment, giving orders the next. The scene where she explains to him why the $15 jacket for Clarence, Jr. didn't actually cost anything is hilarious.
""Life With Father"" is another of those classic movies based on a hit Broadway play. The play, in turn, is based on a book by the real Clarence Day, Jr. I read a short story based on the book when I was a school kid. The story had me laughing so much that I never forgot it. I never saw the play, but the film is certainly no letdown. The sets are lush (these people are upper class, hence the household servants) and the supporting cast is very good. In particular, see a young Elizabeth Taylor as an out-of-town visitor who sparks Clarence Jr.'s interest. The humor is based on witty dialogue and funny situations. If you enjoy this kind of comedy, this flick is for you. It's one of the best, and one of my favorites. Give it a try.",994723200,,1608,4.4358108108108105
553785,5,6303079709,"Mine wasn't but what fun if he had been. One of my all time favorites, and my husband's as well. All the characters are lively, wonderful and contain pieces of everyone's family. When it becomes known that Father (Powell) has  not been baptised, Mother (Dunne) won't rest easy until he is. Add the  complications of patent medicine and visiting relatives, Egad! Father  says.
Almost all of the actors went on to be stars in their own right,  including a young Elizabeth Taylor and Martin Milner. A wonderful example  of a lively and lovely family.",961545600,,547,4.776595744680851
