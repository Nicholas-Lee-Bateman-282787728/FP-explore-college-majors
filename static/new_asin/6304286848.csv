830690,5,6304286848,"This is one tough little flick. Bobby Duval just want's whats owed him, and with Joe Don Baker proceeds to tear up a mob run by Robert Ryan. Familiar faces include Karen Black, Sheree North, Joanna Cassidy, Richard Jaeckel; even Marie Windsor and Elisha Cook, Jr.! Noir-like in it's outlook, dialog and pacing, it's grim take on humanity is probably of reflection of the collective weariness over Viet Nam and the death of the 60's dream.

Other 70's Crime / Cop shows with strong casts and a similiar attitude include: ""Charlie Varrick"" (1973) with Walter Matthau, Joe Don Baker, John Vernon, Sheree North, Norman Fell and Benson Fong; ""The Stone Killer"" (1973) with Charles Bronson, Norman Fell, Ralph Waite, Martin Balsam and Stuart Margolin; and ""Rolling Thunder"" (1977) with Bill Devane, Tommy Lee Jones and Lew Askew. Of these, only Charlie Varrick made it to DVD, all are worth seeking out.",1252454400,2,897,4.940397350993377
830691,5,6304286848,"This is one of those great seventies crime melodramas, lean and mean, thrilling and amoral.  It's got two of the most important elements of these films: pump shotguns and .45s.  Duvall and Baker are ruthless and professional pursuing their vendetta.  The supporting cast is tremendous, down to the small parts played by many veterans of similar films.  Marie Windsor, Elisha Cook, Henry Jones, among others.  Felice Orlandi plays a creep named Orlandi, and the great John Milius regular Roy Jensen has a nice moment or two.  Best of all, Richard Jaeckel as a retired wheel man waxing about the VW Beetle he wants to hot rod.  Look for the luscious Sheree North as a classic moll, and the great Robert Ryan in his last role.  One of my faves, Joanna Cassidy, has an early part as Ryan's squeeze.  Nothing profound here, just slam bang action.  Where the heck is the DVD?????",1223078400,12,873,4.7218543046357615
830692,3,6304286848,"John Flynn's movie is based on the third novel in Richard Stark's ""Parker"" series, same title.  I just caught this on Turner Classic Movies, and while it's an interesting crime/action film, I'm not as enthused as some of the other reviewers.  Donald E. Westlake (Richard Stark) declined to allow use of the ""Parker"" name unless the film maker intended a series.  Thus, we had ""Walker"" in 'Point Blank' and here ""Macklin"" in 'The Outfit.'  A decent cast raises this above the level of the blah B-movie it was obviously intended to be.  The script pulls away from Stark's series, and gives us a variant on 'Charley Varrick,' independent heisters unwittingly ripping off the mob.  Robert Duvall is good and tough, except when he lets that Duvall chuckle off the leash.  Some good stuff survives from the novel, including Chemmy and his brother, and the VW with the hyped-up engine (which becomes a throw-away).  If you know the Parker series, a very young Joe Don Baker takes the Handy McKay role as ""Cody,"" diner and all.  On the other hand, the character of Brett is changed beyond recognition.  Regretfully, this is par for the course for adaptations of Stark, 'Point Blank' still likely being the best.  This film is a must for fans of Duvall and Baker.",1154908800,4,1254,4.7592592592592595

830694,5,6304286848,"This movie is yet another of the untold examples for why I'd like to pound the heads of the movie production execs. When is this going to be released on DVD? Okay enough ranting, I'll get to the specifics.

A small time hood Macklin (Robert Duvall) is released from prison just in time to find out a couple of killers shot his brother. The bank they robbed was run by the syndicate. Its the classic crime deal gone wrong scenario. When a killer comes after him also, he ruthlessly sets out for revenge with the aid of his friend Cody (Joe Don Baker.)

This thriller moves with contiguous action. There aren't any unnecessary scenes. I credit the fast paced direction of John Flynn (who also co-wrote the excellent script.) This was only his third movie as a director, and believe me, this doesn't contain any of the corny stuff found in ""Out To Justice.""

Duvall makes a convincing ruthless thug. Its a scary portrayal. There are solid performances all around from an excellent supporting cast, consisting not only of the aforementioned Joe Don Baker, a gorgeous Sheree North (cameo), in addition to three of Hollywood's late great legendary icons of the classic film noir days: Elisha Cook, Jr. (Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, The Gangster, et al); Jane Greer (Out of the Past, The Big Steal); and in his last film appearance, the great Robert Ryan (The Set Up, The Racket, et al).

830852,5,6304286848,"""The Outfit"" is a movie that slipped under the radar when came out, and it really deserves to be better known.  The cast is amazing: Robert Duvall (fresh from ""The Godfather""), Joe Don Baker (just getting discovered with ""Walking Tall""),Karen Black, Sheree North, Robert Ryan, jazz singer Anita O'Day... and that's just for starters.  Jane Greer (from the classic noir ""Out of the Past"") appears in one of the first scenes.  The very underrated, coolly intelligent Joanna Shimkus (usually noted mostly for being Sidney Poitier's wife) is also on display.

This is one of the first of those movies in which an outcast hero (Duvall, in this case) is pitted against a gamut of villains, who all make the fatal mistake of underestimating him.  This film paved the way for the ""Dirty Harry"" movies, and Charles Bronson's vigilante stuff, but it's much more intelligent and well-paced.  There are lots of funky locales, crisp camera work, good lines galore.  Robert Ryan is great as the uber-villain.  Karen Black is for once playing a role that doesn't emphasize her quirkiness.

I was mesmerized by this movie--which is what movies are supposed to do.  Didn't want to get up to fetch a drink, for fear that I'd miss something important.  Everything is note perfect, flowing along with a sort of Elmore Leonard style of understatement (""the way the characters bounce off each other, talk to each other is most important...the plot just sort of comes along"" ...from an Elmore Leonard interview).

I look forward to viewing it again.",1395187200,2,1526,4.9411764705882355

One word of warning: forget about searching for a particular scene -- there is no time search, and no chapter headings. So if you're looking for something you remembered, you'll have to start at the beginning and laboriously fast-forward.

As a professional thief, he expects the people he works and deals with to be as straight up as himself. Do that and you get equal shares on everything. Cross him and you will likley end up dead.

He's Earl Macklin(Robert Duvall) in this one and when his brother is murdered by a hit team, attempts are made on him, and his partner Jack Cody(played by Joe Don Baker), Macklin moves against the people, the Mob, who set up the contracts on the three. Being a professional, he names a price to make him go away, promising to hit mob business until it's paid, and everything taken before then is gravy.

Unfortunately, he's double-crossed and it sets him on the path that ends with an invasion of the big mob boss, Mailer(Robert Ryan), at the end.

830937,4,6304286848,"This 1973 Neo-Noir film delivers a punch to the gut with excellent performances, direction, and screenplay, all in top-notch form. This neglected film was Robert Duvall's 1st starring role and he delivers big-time playing Earl Macklin, a character based on Richard Stark's ""Point Blank""(1967), hero ""Parker"". Macklin has just been released from jail and when he discovers that his brother has been knocked off by the Mob, he puts his revenge plan in motion despite overwhelming odds. He recruits his partner, Cody, played by Joe Don Baker, and starts his climb up the ladder to reach the #1 boss. The film is a Noir-lover's delight. It's co-stars include Robert Ryan, Jane Greer, Marie Windsor, Timothy Carey, Richard Jaeckel, and Elisha Cook, Jr. All are well known film-noir veterans. The cast also includes Karen Black as Macklin's girl, Archie Moore, Joanna Cassidy, and Sheree North. Robert Ryan's appearance was his last on film. From the opening 5 minute pre-credit sequence, to the final frames of the film, the action moves along very well. It is significant to note that Duvall made this film in between ""The Godfather""(1972), and ""The Godfather Part 2""(1974). Also, Joe Don Baker starred in his box-office smash ""Walking Tall"", also in 1973. So, both actors were in top-notch form as gunmen, in the film. The Director and Screenwriter was John Flynn, who adapted the film from the novel by Richard Stark. It is significant to note that Macklin is a free-lance robber who finds himself under attack from The Syndicate and chooses to engage in active retaliation. TCM screened this film on last Wednesday, 5-22, and it was hosted by Robert Osborne. The film was shown in the pan & scan version and I was delighted to see this film in Widescreen, 16x9, 1.85:1. The film is part of The Archive Collection by Warner Brothers. The remastered film is an excellent transfer. The film is truly an action-fan's delight! The running time is 103 minutes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SMRZ!!!",1369699200,17,1982,4.990936555891238
830938,4,6304286848,"This 1973 crime noir directed by John Flynn is a film adaptation of Richard Stark's (aka Donald E. Westlake's) novel by the same name. It's a revenge film in many ways, with Earl Macklin (Robert Duvall) being released from prison and finding out his brother Eddie has been killed by members of the Outfit. Teaming up with Jack Cody (Joe Don Baker), Macklin goes on a series of sprees aimed at getting retribution for his brother's death.

One great aspect of this film is how Flynn is able to make this a thought-provoking crime film with characters who are multi-demensional and well-defined. Duvall shines as Earl Macklin, and really personifies the antihero who is ruthless enough not to let others push him around, but gentleman enough to know what is fair and what is not fair. Karen Black does a commentable job as Macklin's girlfriend Bett, and Joe Don Baker is fantastic as Macklin's partner in crime. Robert Ryan, in the final role of his career, plays one of the central villains, Mailer, who  looks for ways  to bump off Macklin.
The central theme of this film is the idea of taking down the big bully, in this case, The Outfit. It is a well-acted film that is presented with perfect flair for the hard boiled noir tradition.

The DVD itself is fantastic quality as well. This is a hidden gem of a crime film, one often overlooked.",1369612800,3,1342,4.626050420168068

830999,3,6304286848,"The Outfit  (1973)  Here we have a down-n-dirty lean and mean crime melodrama, based on a novel by Donald Westlake writing under his harder edged Richard Stark pseudonym. Macklin (Duvall) is released from prison and finds out from his longtime girlfriend Bett (Black) that his brother has been killed gangland style. A little digging turns up the info that the last bank Macklin and his brother robbed was a front for the mob (or Outfit) run by Mailer (Ryan). They put the hit on Macklin's bro, now they want to make it a double Macklin funeral. But he's not going to go gently into that good night and instead goes on the run with Bett. Through one of Mailer's captains, Menner (Carey), Macklin gets word to Mailer that all will be forgiven if the mob will shuck out $250,000 to him. Otherwise, he will commence an attack on their enterprises like they've never seen. (Lesson #1: When a guy like Macklin comes to you asking for $250,000, give it to him. Then kill him later when he's drunk and covered in hookers...) The Outfit respectfully indicates their answer is no, sure their torpedoes will find their mark before Macklin can cause too much trouble. But Macklin's a crafty devil, and re-teaming with his old pal Cody (Baker) they start running and gunning on The Outfit's operations, stealing thousands of dollars that Macklin has already warned would not reduce the $250,000 debt he feels he is owed. Gunfire, fistfights, pistol whippings, girl smackings, and car chases all ensue.
Thematically it's very similar to Westlake's novel The Hunter (filmed twice - 1967's Point Blank and 1999's Payback) - with a lead character not likely to win any church or civic awards looking to score a very specific amount of money from a gang of criminals he feels wronged him; but it's also different from both of those films and stands on its own. It's nice to see character pro Duvall get the lead here, and he's ably supported by that cast of familiar faces, with standout awards going to Baker, Carey, and especially Ryan, in his final role - he died before the film was released. The ladies don't have all that much to do, and the movie will never be mistaken for a National Organization for Women training flick, but the actresses do get in a couple of nice moments, Black with that strange allure she always brings to the table, and North nearly falling out of a flimsy little nothing she almost wears in her scene. Director Flynn handles his duties adroitly, keeping a solid pace but not forgetting some solid character moments along the way. These aren't people you would want to have over for Sunday dinner, but it's fun to watch them run around waving guns at each other for an hour and forty minutes.",1353024000,3,2707,4.672955974842767

Amazing cast, and great atmosphere make it worth the time, but this is just a cut above low-budget 70's exploitation fare, and with this pedigree it should have been far better than that.

It is clear this DVD was produced on the quick and cheap.  Quality is just OK, and a lack of chapter stops or a 'scene selection' screen on the DVD is truly annoying.

831005,3,6304286848,"One of my favorite authors is Richard Stark (the wonderful Donald Westlake on a ""bad"" day).
He created perhaps the greatest anti-hero in hardboiled crime fiction: Parker - no first or last name.  His first book was THE HUNTER, wherein Stark set Parker against ""The Outfit"", seeking
loot money he felt was owed him.  Parker was implacable, unstoppable -and it took him three books - rising through the criminal food chain - to finally get what he felt was unjustly his.  Lee Marvin made the perfect ""Parker"" - ""Walker"", actually: Westlake would not allow them to use Parker's name, as I understand it.  And director John Boorman captured the essence of Parker in the strange, time-fragmented version of THE HUNTER: POINT BLANK.

A few years later, John Flynn decided to film THE OUTFIT, the third volume of the series.  He did it in a very straight-forward, non-""arty"" manner which captured the drive of Stark's prose.  Robert Duvall plays ""Macklin"", still out to get his dough; Joe Don Baker is his buddy Handy.  It's not a classic by any means; but, oddly, it does carry you along, wondering if Macklin will be able to bring The Outfit to its knees and its head, Robert Ryan, into a permanently comatose state of non-being.

This is a Warner DVD-R.  Image is dark and bit soft; but - hey! - it put me back into that shoebox multi-cinema of beloved memory.  I had a blast.  Stark fans: buy it!",1299369600,28,1393,4.640816326530612

7866929,5,6304286848,"Not only exceptionally cast, this gritty, mid-seventies powerhouse has so many glorious segments woven into it that after having not seen it in ten years, I rewatched it recently and realized that I remembered many segments but thought they were from different movies (but of course was delighted to be reunited with this, the hardboiled conglomerate that is THE OUTFIT).

Based on the Richard Stark (nome de plume of Donald E. Westlake, natch) novel, the story in other hands could have been written as a standard pulp revenge-fest, but instead buys you a ticket aboard a fast-moving and entertaining locomotive-like piece of cinema full of seriously hardened criminals and loopy hotheads alike.

Robert Duvall provides a measured and intense-as-all-get-out performance, while Joe Don Baker is well cast as his no-nonsense sidekick. Throw in a batch of Film Noir regulars and you have a not-too-well-known slice of downbeat seventies heaven!

As a final note, do NOT watch the trailer before the movie, as it does the unthinkable and takes some of the juice out of the ending (and it is very good; you'll want to absorb the full impact after riding out the main feature).",1519171200,,1172,5.030927835051546

7866932,4,6304286848,"having only seen this film for the first time recently on TCM, I immediately liked it.  If you like other post-noir films like Point Blank, you will like this hard-boiled underworld drama with outstanding acting from Robert Duvall, Joe Don Baker, Karen Black, Richard Jaeckel, Robert Ryan, Elisha Cook, and even Timothy Carey.  The atmosphere reminds me of a Scorcese film.",1473465600,,373,5.098360655737705

7866937,4,6304286848,"If Quentin Tarantino never saw this flick it surely anticipated ""Pulp Fiction"" twenty years later.  The film is a veritable smorgasbord for movie buffs.  Consider the presence of noir vets Robert Ryan and Jane Greer as well as cast members from Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing"" (Timothy Carey, Marie Windsor, Elisha Cook).  It plays like a cross between ""Point Blank"" and ""Get Carter"".  That said the film bogs down a tick in its trivial pursuits but still a lot of fun.",1432512000,,469,4.825
