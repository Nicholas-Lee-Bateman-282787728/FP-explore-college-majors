6142393,5,B00H9GIASM,"Better half of the TV series, this includes the beach event episodes.
The video quality is way off the charts, the colors are crazy vibrant and far outshines when this show originally aired on Hulu.
If you only plan to pick one, this is the season to watch.
the acchel world mini episodes are included.",1404864000,3,302,4.509090909090909
6142394,5,B00H9GIASM,"The story of Accel World Set 2 picks up where it left off in the first set. This is the third story arc which focuses on Haru's struggle as he faces off against the most devious and clever opponent he has ever faced in the Accelerated World. The enemy Haru faces is his classmate Nomi Seiji, a new transfer student that uses his power of acceleration to cheat for personal gain. When Haru confronts Seiji and tells him to stop a battle ensues between them. Haru appears to be winning at first but Seiji planning accounted for Haru's power of flight and he was able to grapple him to the ground. This is where we learn of Seiji power which is to steal the power of his opponents and then be able to keep it and use againist them.

The course of the story arc centers around Haru trying to stop his now immensely powerful enemy without the power of his wings. All and all the story of Accel World was great and I would even say that it is greater that it's rival Sword Art Online. The real downside to this show is fact that it hasn't delved into what it originally set out to do which was getting a player to level 10 by defeating the kings of color. However that probably was for the best since deviating from the source material has not been a good thing in most cases. The only thing we can hope for is another season so we can get a proper end to this show.",1403308800,4,1360,4.171102661596958

6142396,5,B00H9GIASM,"The first time I watched Accel world, I watched it straight through, all the episodes, over a couple of days, only noting that there was a change because the intro and ending songs had changed.

Part 2 covers the ""Dusk Taker"" arc, and I remember dreading having to watch it again, because it seemed so tense and suspenseful the first time I saw it.  But, now, having seen it the second time, it didn't seem as long, and was much less stressful this time around.

This entry offers more character growth for all of the main cast, in growing stronger (for Chiyuri, Haruyuki, and Taku) friendship bonds growing stronger, alliances strengthening, and even, for me at least, a little bit of a tear jerking moment at the end with Kuroyukihime as she faces some of her own past issues.

This segment of the series is great, because it treats us as the viewer to more growth in the characters and the universe, and acts almost like the first half was the tutorial, and now we have been let loose to see some of the more advanced features of the Accel World universe.  New moves, more battle types, world rules, secret systems, cheating, and even social interaction between Burst Linkers are all give more spotlight time, and make the series feel more alive.

And, important as it is, each portion of the story maintains a consistent context, and isn't just a string of happenstance.  For fans of the precursor series Sword Art Online, there is even a throwback homage that links the two works that makes a brief cameo.

So, if you enjoyed the first half, I would suggest getting the second, as while it is a second story arc, both parts are halves of the same greater arc.

As for the Dub, it fits better in part two, then it did in part one, and characters such as Yuniko and Ash Roller were cast extremely well.  Also, not, that as much as it irritates my friends, I do tend to like Anime dubs, so I may be biased.",1396828800,7,1908,4.456896551724138
6142397,5,B00H9GIASM,"I just finished this yesterday and it didn't dissapoint.  I was starting to wonder if Harayuki (or however you spell it) was gonna mature and man up but no worries here he redeems himself. There were a couple of parts that angered me in the same way DBZ does when they almost beat a villain and he returns to full power (really quite annoying) but if you remain patient and stick around it actually makes ALOT of sense and happens to achieve a much greater goal.

This part comes with the 2 mini-episodes(which I haven't watched yet) and idk if they relate to the immidiete plot but I can tell you that while this wraps everything up very nicely they could definatly make a Season 2 here and it would be SO GOOD.  All we have to do is get this great show out there because I think its way better than stuff like SAO because it focuses on battles and actually keeps the overall ""gaming"" theme well covered, and all the while managing to still have room for a little romance.

Also I had previously stated that the kids obesity is overall a really good thing in the last review.  Well part 2 pretty much confirms what I said, your insecurities and emotional scars shape your avatar so being a pathetic chubby wimp could be a good thing for having a powerful avatar in the world of Brain Burst.  It was really refreshing to see that kind of depth to the characters and how it related to their powers and fighting capabilities.

I got both this and part 1 for about 35$ each (on blu-ray)which was much better than the unreasonable retail price, and I suggest you scout amazon for awhile until the price drops to somewhere around that.",1396137600,4,1630,4.413333333333333

6142400,5,B00H9GIASM,"A fantastic anime that deserves a continuation.  Granted Noumi is a rather stock villain, but he serves his purpose well.  The characters are very well put together, particularly main character Haruyuki who manages to shine.  Since I got it, I've watched this show beginning to end three times, bought the light novels,  and read The manga.  I can't recommend this show enough.",1434240000,3,377,5.016129032258065
6142401,3,B00H9GIASM,"I reviewed part 1 of Accel world with 5 stars and honestly it deserve it. Part 2 however does not deserve anything more then 3. Story wise this concludes the series on such a dumb cliffhanger that I would forgive if Accel world showed signs of coming back to animation which it does not. The animation and sound again are just as solid as part 1 but the story kills it. Don't get me wrong there are moments of greatness, why the 3 stars,  but the ending deems the score it's that bad. So buyer beware I'm not saying not to buy part 2, especially if you loved part 1, but don't expect a good ending. I'd advise just enjoying the show, so buy this part, but just keep this on your mind...  expect it to end bad.",1434240000,2,709,4.130434782608695

8631179,4,B00H9GIASM,"This one was good, written by the same person as sword art but more childish I think the hero really starts to get on your nerves, but over all it was worth the watch",1473379200,,166,3.911764705882353
8631180,4,B00H9GIASM,"This is a great show, and fortunately there are no problems with the video quality of this Blu-ray release, like there are on some other Viz titles released at the same time. Unless you count the fact that the menu animation of just Disc 1 in both Accel World Set 1 and 2 has the wrong fps, which is minor.

The dub is filled with f-words. The amount of swearing in Set 2 surpasses the previous volume. Most of the time it feels like they are trying too hard. There are some things said that are even worse than the f-word, so don't let your kids watch the dub. The writing for the dub is nerdy and painful in general. In the middle episodes the characters try to speak stupid phrases in Japanese as if someone in the world understands their random outbursts. I feel sorry for whoever had to say those lines.

The show has an interesting story and great animation. I don't generally find the characters appealing to look at, but rather it's the robots that I prefer to have on the screen. There are different styles of robots from different designers. It's refreshing that they are not giant robots as in most Sunrise productions. The characters play a video game where they are the robots. I like Scarlet Rain, Lime Bell, and Lagoon Dolphin.

There is too much focus on bullying for my taste. It was fine to introduce the story with that, but move on to something else already. Not every bad guy needs to be a school bully. When I play video games online I don't bully others, I just beat them.",1472601600,,1495,4.389891696750903
