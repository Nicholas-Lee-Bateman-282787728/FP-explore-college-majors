6991938,4,B00SRI5VHE,"This print could do with some restoration. Appears to be directly from VHS but quite watchable. An excellent cast featuring
Ray Milland starring and directing; the incredibly pretty Mary Murphy and character actors and soon to be stars such as Raymond Burr and Lee Van Cleef. Ward Bond appearing  a few years before ""Wagon Train. Very enjoyable Western.",1436227200,,353,5.086206896551724

6991940,5,B00SRI5VHE,"From my first viewing of ""A Man Alone"", I wanted to own the DVD so that I could watch it over and over. Every time I see it, I find some different wonderful facet I hadn't seen before.  Marvelous cast, and a superior script make it a first class Western Movie. Five stars are not enouigh. Ten would be a truer rating for such a movie as ""A Man Alone"".",1430438400,3,351,4.014285714285714

8699095,5,B00SRI5VHE,"A MAN ALONE was one of the last major pictures that the Republic Studio organization released as it slowly expired, and it is one of the best Westerns of 1955. In addition to starring, Ray Milland directed in his directorial debut. Fascinatingly, except for a couple of muffled words to his horse, for the first twenty-five minutes of the film, Milland says nothing; everything is indicated and demonstrated by his actions which set the stage for what is to follow. The action, although concentrated almost claustrophobically in a town cordoned off, is intense and riveting. And what really helps is that Herbert Yates of Republic and Milland have assembled a superb cast, including Raymond Burr (who makes a superb and heartless villain), Ward Bond (the sheriff, who we meet initially ill with yellow fever), Lee Van Cleef (responsible for brutal murder), and Mary Murphy (who becomes something of Miland's eventual love interest).  The print offered is decent with good color, although it may well be a copy of an earlier VHS release. No matter; the price is right, the film is excellent, Highly recommended.",1446163200,5,1110,5.032608695652174
