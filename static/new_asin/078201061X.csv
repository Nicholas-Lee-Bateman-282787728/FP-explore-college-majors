39375,5,078201061X,"THE JAZZ SINGER, primarily, is a medium for memorializing, viewing, and enjoying Mr. Neil Diamond's skills in ballad singing.  His voice is unique, perhaps among all recording artists, in that it possesses a rough edge it that is similar to, but not whatsoever the same thing as ""vocal fry.""  As is well documented, ""vocal fry"" is an annoying vocal technique used by young women, by actresses playing young women, and by country and western artists both male and female.  That said, I simply cannot get enough of that natural, effortless ""ripping tear"" effect that comes with Neil Diamond's voice.  The arrangement style used by his back-up orchestra, is a melange of saccharine-sweet waterfall of weeping strings that is the trademark of Henry Mancini, combined with a non-threatening version of a typical 5-man rock'n'roll band.

THE PLOT.  Mr. Diamond plays an assistant cantor in a small synagogue in New York City.  The film does a very good job in portraying Old-World Jewishness, among the older people such as Neil Diamond's aged father, and the Old-World Jewishness of Mr. Diamond's wife.  The wife (""Rivka"") is played by seasoned television actress,  Catlin Adams (born Nira Barab). In the opening minutes of this movie, we learn that Mr. Diamond leads a double life, where he moonlights by singing with a rhythm'n'blues band and performing in black-people-only night clubs.  To make a long story short, Mr. Diamond gets an offer for a two-week gig in Los Angeles, dumps his Jewish wife, and picks up with a shiksa (played by Lucille Arnaz, daughter of Lucy Ball).  Lucille Arnaz plays an agent (Molly) with the recording industry in Los Angeles, and is well-connected with the industry.  Mr. Diamond's career hits some rough spots, and Mr. Diamond does a great job in altering his character's behavior to become a difficult-to-work-with singer with an arrogant personality.  His girlfriend (Molly) realizes that Mr. Diamond's character is going through some wrenching emotional issues, brought on by the mutual abandonment between he and his Jewish wife, and also brought on by his father's visit to Los Angeles to see him.  As part of Mr. Diamond's emotional problems, he drives like a madman through the streets of Los Angeles, heads for the desert, where his car breaks down, then he takes a bus to Laramie, Wyoming, where he gets a job singing in a country & western bar.  Eventually, one of his band-mates tracks him down and convinces him to return to Los Angeles.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW.  To fully enjoy this movie, you need to know the following information.  First, Catalina Island is located just off the coast of California, perhaps an hour's boat ride from Los Angeles.  Also, you need to know that sailing from Los Angeles to Acapulco takes over a week.  Second, you need to know that Jewish people who are observers avoid eating ham.  Third, you need to know that observers of Judaism keep a mezuzah attached to the frame of the front door of their house or apartment, and whenever Jewish people walk into their home, they touch the mezuzah.  While THE JAZZ SINGER is not the model of a subtle, intellectual drama, there do exist a few subtle moments of clever humor, where you do need to know about Catalina Island, about the mezuzah, and about eating ham.

JOSHUA TREES  I did enjoy the many Joshua trees that are shown in the desert scenes.  From first hand experience, I know that the areas between Joshua Tree National Park up to Mojave National Preserve have millions of Joshua trees, but there are no oil wells in these places.  Also, I know from first hand experience that there are many Joshua trees along Route 14 in the Lancaster area, and on northwards  to and along Route 295 in the Mount Whitney area, but there are not any oil wells in these places.  THE JAZZ SINGER depicts many Joshua trees in a desert that also has many oil wells in the same desert.  But it seems to me that this was just a way of making the location more Californian (but not an attempt at accuracy).

HAPPY ENDING (warning; spoiler alert).  Molly ends up having Mr. Diamond's baby and they get married to each other (in that order) and Molly converts to Judaism.

Some ""critics"" have published some bad reviews about this movie.  Please do not pay attention to them.  These critics are stupid.  The Jazz Singer is a fine lite-romance movie.  This is a fine movie, without guns, without computer graphics, and without nude scenes. This a just an enjoyable, old-fashioned movie.  But if you have a burning need for a more substantial movie that concerns a similar subject (bio-pic of a popular singing artist), what I recommend is What's Love Got to Do With It, starring Angela Bassett as Tina Turner and Laurence Fishburne as Ike Turner.",1474761600,,4749,4.81134401972873

39538,5,078201061X,"Anyone who has ever grown up in an intensely spiritual home, with its certainties and ceremonies, where immediate and extended family members give absolute obedience to the clan and its customs. Where habits are unwavering, automatic, cherished; and the weight of a long glorious history is an ever-present companion  like a comfortable shawl around the shoulders, or a worn but unmistakable patina on a favorite mug, can sense the absolute authenticity in the Jazz Singer.

They should also be able to sense the conflict raging deep within Yussel, son of the cantor, and slated to follow in his fathers footsteps as so many had done before. The life of a cantor is about service and tradition and leaves no place for fulfilling personal dreams of singing your own songs. The charm of the Jazz Singer is not about the actingDiamond is hopelessly outmatched by Sir Lawrence Olivier, one of the finest most charismatic actors who has ever practiced the craft. Diamonds effrontery in even attempting to share the stage with a master tells you how much this Al Jolson story must have inspired and resonated with him. No, its not Diamonds acting you will remember  its his music within the context of the story-telling that makes the Jazz Singer remarkable. Diamond is warm, often tender, insistent, melancholy, and passionate, at times bereft and inspirational. But through it all he is always true to himself  Yussel the little boy who would look out from his  window on those Brooklyn Roads, who would imagine what wonders existed out there, who would build [him] a castle with dragons and kings, And I'd ride off with them (Brooklyn Roads).

The Jazz Singer is an incredibly powerful story of a cloistered, talented young man who feels compelled to follow his dreams to see where they lead; and in doing so throws off the weight of his destiny, history, tradition code of ethics and the expectations of those near and dear. He exerts his independence, embarking on a personal journey of discovery that pulls him inexorably toward a destiny he only dimly understands. This compulsion drives him onward and in the end he finds himself; and he is as he ever was  just in a different place and space.  His synagogue now a concert hall, his congregation now comprised of uninitiated but enthusiastic believers, and Diamond the new-age cantor bares his soul to this worshipful crowd  while singing his songs, his songs of life and spirituality.

Best of all, he finds a way to negotiate peace with himself and say Hello Again to his new wife, the patient Molly, and put his simpler, nave past behind him. He is reunited with his inflexible father, cantor Rabinovitch, who had previously disowned him in a terrifying and moving scene where after learning the depths of Diamonds infidelity and betrayal, runs screaming from him while tearing his robe: I have NO son! Yes, Diamond is back from the dead  resurrected, reinstated, complete, fulfilled and able to pour his whole soul into his music. The Jazz Singer is bornand saved.

As the closing credits scroll by, we wonder briefly about the dutiful, long-lost Rivka. Does she too find a pot of gold at the end of her personal rainbow? Does she experience a Summerlove of her own? Does pursuit of a dream trump fidelity and loyalty to those left behind? We aren't told, Diamond, the Jazz Singer doesnt say. I guess we are left to ponder that question for ourselves.",1446595200,,3407,4.855172413793103

The songs he wrote for the movie were absolute first rate, especially ""America"". As an actor, however, it seemed as though he was reciting lines far more than he was acting. He certainly did not generate much emotion in the role and it was hard to sympathize with the character. Even more embarrassing, he was acting along side Lawrence Olivier, one of the greatest actors of all time.

I recommend you buy the movie soundtrack. That soundtrack was one of Diamond's best albums. This one of those rare occasions where the soundtrack of a movie is better than the movie.",1424908800,,845,4.741496598639456

Criticisms of the acting amuse me, as I believe everyone did a great job as is attested to the fact the movie has endured and rip-off artists are able to get SOME people (not me of course, thankfully) to pay ridiculous amounts for a copy on DVD.

40277,4,078201061X,"Neil Diamond is a huge favorite of mine because of his rich voice and his songs that speak to life, love and discovery of what matters in life.  Having said that, Neil Diamond is a decent actor - not great. His best scenes are when he is singing or interacting with Luci Arnaz.  The movie has nothing to do with anyone singing jazz, so be aware of this.  Yes, this is a melodrama about dreams fulfilled, family break-up and love refound but it is decent entertainment.

PLOT SPOILER ALERT:

The plot is about a NYC super-talented singer/songwriter, Yussel Rabinovitch (Diamond), who primarily sings as a Jewish cantor at a poor synagogue. He sings with his strong-willed father Cantor Rabinovitch (Laurence Olivier)who has plans for Yussel to take over as the main cantor once he retires. Yussel is also married to his childhood sweetheart, Rivka (Catlin Adams), who works at a local Jewish school. On the side, Yussel also writes songs for a struggling black singing group.  There is one troubling scene in which Yussel performs in black face and a wig when a member of the quartet gets arrested.  Yussel's life takes a sharp curve when his well-meaning friend and singing buddy Bubba (Franklin Ajaye)pitches one of his songs to a popular singer, Keith Lennox (Paul Nicholas). The song, ""Love on the Rocks"" is being butchered and the record producer wants the composer to help.  Yussel grapples with his desire to go but his wife (who refuses to join him in LA) and father argue with him before capitulating to him. Once in LA, Molly Bell (Arnaz) encourages Yussel to perform his song his way.  Tempers flare and Yussel and Molly are dismissed.  The two embark on a journey to jump-start Yussel - now known as Jess Robin.  The two finally get a break with Jess opening for a frontliner and fall in love.  Jess and Molly fight these feelings because Jess wants Rivka to join him.  Eventually, Rivka flies to LA to convince Jess to return to their life in New York but Jess refuse, having tasted fame.  The two part and love blooms for Molly and Jess.  Of course, Cantor Rabinovitch flies out to correct and retrieve his son.  Tempers flare and the elder man disowns his son for divorcing his wife and taking up with a non-Jewish woman.  This deflates Jess who leaves and goes on a long sojourn.  He returns to find he has a son but still no contact with his father.  In the end, Jess and his father are reconciled when the elder sees his son perform at their old synagogue and then in concert.",1375574400,,2493,4.612244897959184

Also, the picture ""jiggles"" whenever the camera moves at more than a slow speed.  The sound is just mediocre, but I overcame that by switching the feed through my stereo sound system.  I would go through the hassle of returning it, but I have to admit that I mainly bought it for the music. It's a great example of ""you get what you pay for.""",1354233600,18,678,4.022388059701493

40485,3,078201061X,"I'll say right off the bat that Neil Diamond is not much of an actor but he was certainly adequate in this role.  Again, Luci Arnaz lifts what could have been a real TURKEY right out of gobble gobble land and into Pretty Good Land.  She is just so good.  One of the worst things about the film is Lawrence Olivier's portrayal of his father. For one thing, unless Neil is supposed to be 45 in this movie then the father just looks way too old to be his dad. And, he overacts in every scene to the point where it is distracting (disgusting). It must have cost a mint to get him and heaven knows that Diamond had a mint to spend I'm sure but couldn't the director have pulled him in some - a lot. This would have been a much better movie with someone else in the role of his father. The scenes of Neil over reacting to his father disowning him are also overdone but I know they needed something to be a turning point in the story. Couldn't just be him getting more and more successful. I've watched it several times and I always enjoy it except, of course, for Lord Olivier. He just grates on my nerves every time. And, as I said, Luci Arnaz is such a joy to watch. I don't know why she was never a huge star. But, the music is, of course, the star of the movie.

40567,5,078201061X,"I was 11 years old when this movie came home to my house from the video store. I asked my Dad to rent STAR WARS...I got THE JAZZ SINGER. It's funny. Dad has been gone now nearly five years and I still watch this one every year on his birthday since he died. It is a film that every time I see it, it takes me back to that Wednesday in the summer when I first heard ""America"" coming from the screen door in the garage. I had to run in after my Dad repeated the song. From that moment forward I was hooked on this movie...hooked on Neil Diamond. I have seen him in concert 22 times since I saw this film for the first time and it just takes me back to my youth every time I watch it.

First off, Neil Diamond doesn't do a bad job as an actor. It is quite disconcerting that reviewers accused him of playing himself for the sake of releasing music. There is so much about this movie that just speaks to the viewer and shoots from the hip. Let's first discuss the way it was shot. The fuzziness and over-all haze in some shots is great. This especially noticeable when Neil is onstage as Jess Robin in L.A. and Eddie Gibbs walks out of his performance. When Neil looks out at his manager, Molly (played by Lucie Arnaz) for the reason why, she smiles and follows him out. This scene looks different in quality, but still holds up well. The humor is right on the mark and is not too over the top. Catlin Adams is so annoying as his first wife, Rivka, that you are glad by the time she she leaves him. The poor man's life would've been too long otherwise, and Arnaz is great as Molly.

Laurence Olivier is a smart choice to play Neil Diamond's father for the simple reason that Neil's acting around him as his son is more genuine. If you're intimidated by your leading actor, then it really comes off in Neil's scenes with him. Diamond's own nervousness, which he revealed in VH-1's BEHIND THE MUSIC back in 2001 underpins the drama very well between the father/son dynamic. Even with Neil's best friend, Bubba (Franklin Ajaye), the story is fun to watch and the opening number in the film's first five minutes is a very nice homage to Al Jolson when Diamond's Jess Robin dons black face to cover for a back-up singer who was arrested for stealing a car.

It's the soundtrack that makes this film work well, too. America, Hello Again, Love On the Rocks, Songs of Life, Amazed & Confused, and even You Baby, Hey Louise and On the Robert E. Lee from the party celebrating of all things, a firing, still hold up nearly 32 years after they were written...something Neil Diamond always manages to do well. All his songs hold up through the years and this film and its 9-time platinum soundtrack are no exception. Crank up the audio when he kicks the power into high gear in the finale of America. It has a strong bass track, great lyrics and his experienced band sure bring this song, as well as this movie to life.

My Dad was right to bring this home 30 years ago. I just wish we could watch it together on his birthday. But now, I watch it for him. Thank you Dad for giving me the gift of Neil Diamond's movie and music when I was 11. Don't leave this planet without watching this movie at least once. It's a true classic in every sense of the word!",1323475200,2,3240,4.263414634146342

40616,4,078201061X,"Despite two problems, this thirty year old film is enjoyable, especially because of Neil Diamond's singing. All of the actors are very good and Laurence Olivier as Diamond's father, a very observant Jew, a cantor, is brilliant. Olivier is the foil against Diamond's need to abandon his religion, violate many of its principles, marry a non-Jewish girl, and sing popular songs that he wrote to mass audiences. We are able to identify with both Diamond and with Olivier, and with the girl as well.

 The problems are, first that the story is simplistic. The struggle between the parent and child is not new. Yet, as previously stated, the acting overcomes this problem and makes the story interesting and entertaining. Second, there are many errors about Jewish practices. Either the advisors to the film did not know Judaism as well as they claimed or the director and the company decided to ignore their advice. But most viewers would not recognize these subtleties, such as no knowledgeable Jew would wish another ""good yomtov,"" a happy greeting, on the solemn day of Yom Kippur.",1294185600,,1080,4.961325966850829

40675,4,078201061X,"While clearing out old VHS tapes recently I decided we simply had to have a DVD version of this film. I hadn't seen it in years, but I watched this anniversary edition 3 times in 2 days: once the regular way, once all the way through with the commentary by producer Jerry Leider, and again without the commentary. Neil Diamond is a genius. It never ceases to amaze me that I still learn of songs recorded by other artists that he has written. I've been a fan and admirer of this man and his music for 40 years and four years ago I had the pleasure and joy of seeing him live in concert: I rank it as one of the Top 5 concerts of my life. His female fans that night ranged from age 6 to 90+, and his recent DVD release,""Hot August Night NYC"" shows that at least 3 generations of people can sing along with every song he performs. And he doesn't simply perform: he is a showman, making sure that everyone in the audience is part of the gig, and it is a good time! He is kind, gracious, humble, not afraid to make fun of himself (the sequined shirts!), and gives well deserved credit to his amazing band, who have been with him for over 30 years now. One leaves his concert not feeling that they have simply sat and watched someone sing for 2 hours, but as if they have been part of an experience---a joyful one, with ""beautiful noise"".
""The Jazz Singer"" is a wonderful movie, and was highly underated at the time of its release. Think of the music alone: ""America"", which is now a ""classic""; the achingly beautiful ""Hello Again"", and all the rest. He's stunningly handsome, and the love between his character and Molly, played brilliantly by Lucie Arnaz, is palpable. Yes, the party scene after they get fired from the studio is a little corny, but it IS fun! It was delightful to learn from Jerry Leider's comments how much ad-libbing was done by the major members of the cast, which made it even more fun. It must have been the experience of a lifetime for Neil to work with an actor of the caliber of Sir Laurence Olivier---who, from the very first day, told everyone to simply ""Call me Larry."" He and Neil developed a close bond during the making of this film which only added a genuine quality to the difficulties in their onscreen relationship as father and son.
The movie was generally panned by reviewers and critics when it was first released, yet everyone remembers it, they know the songs by heart---even people who weren't even born in 1980. I wish Neil Diamond had done more films featuring the gift of his music, and he's still mighty easy on the eyes. Even now, at age 68, he's still out there touring, stronger than ever! Any fan MUST have his newly released DVD/CD set, it's simply outstanding. I, for one, will live in ""Diamondville"" forever---in blue jeans!",1252627200,,2774,4.4411764705882355

Even though I've since been reimbursed,I'm angry that he did this without my permission or knowledge. Lesson learned:Always be sure to sign out from Amazon when using a shared computer because someone else could easily use your information to make purchases. The reason that I went to visit my Dad and his wife down in Florida was to see Neil Diamond in concert. Both of them were disappointed that the show started half an hour after the time posted on the tickets.

40714,4,078201061X,"I was surprised when I viewed Neil Diamond's ""The Jazz Singer"" because I liked it better than I thought I would. It has little connection with Al Jolson or the previous remake with Danny Thomas. Only once early in the film does  Diamond gets in blackface--for a gig with a black group in a black club. Diamond plays a fifth generation cantor who has to battle his cantor-father, Laurence Olivier, of all people, to break free from tradition and become a commercial success as a singer.
 The soundtrack of Neil Diamond songs is strong and effective. ""Hello Again"" and ""Love on the Rocks"" are standouts with special kudos going to ""America"" which is thrilling in a Diamond reprise in the final moments of the film--touching, heartwarming, and a tear jerker.
The plot is well-constructed and involving. Because his father has disowned him, Diamond leaves his successful career to become a vagabond for a year. The scene in which Diamond sings a traditional Jewish song in a synagogue is quite moving.
 Diamond does a creditable job as an actor. The movie is well-paced and, for me, not in the least boring. Perhaps the movie got a bad rap in the beginning; it was labeled a bomb. At first I confused it with ""The Jolson Story"" with Larry Parks, thinking it was a remake of that successful film. The CD based upon the movie is a good complement to the movie. Neil Diamond fans are probably going to like it more than others.",1240099200,2,1420,4.649402390438247

Sir Laurence Olivier was amazing as the elderly Jewish Cantor steeped in his tradition and ways of the past, a wonderful performance!

But the music - it's worth it just for the music.  From beginning to end, this score is Diamond's, from the driving rhythms of ""You, Baby Baby"" to the haunting strains of the Kol Nidre, the traditional Jewish prayer which was arranged by Diamond.  The score spawned 3 Number 1 hits - ""Hello Again, Hello"", ""Love On the Rocks"" and a song that has become  anthemic, ""America"".  Get it for the music!",1236729600,,687,4.346456692913386

I will agree the the title should be the Rock Singer, then again the last version of A Star is Born with Steisand and Kristofferson could use the same title.  The original story of that movie was about the rise and fall of movie stars.

 I grew up seeing the 1950's version of this movie and always enjoyed it.  The updated version had the good sense to drop the jazz  and vaudeville storyline.  Period pieces don't go over well these days.
I bought the soundtrack in vinyl and loved it.  At least when Jess decided he had had enough, he just left town.  He didn't get hooked on drugs or booze.  That in itself is worth seeing as a piece of good sensible advice.  The music is a good mixture.  Laurence Olivier gave his usual stellar performance.

Certainly, the theme has been done before.  And certainly, we all know how it will end.  But the story is timeless, and well told... and the music?  Well... it is Neil's best work according to some, and fine work according to others... so what's to criticize?

We could pick at the acting of a young Ms. Arnaz.  We could say that the elderly Lord Olivier dodders through his role... We might even ask if Mr. Diamond ""gets"" the Jewishness of the role...

40852,5,078201061X,"Neil Diamond plays the roll of Yussel, the son of a Jewish Cantor who is expected to follow the traditional role of five previous generations of Cantors, dedicating their lives to guide a congregation through music.

As he seeks his own individuality, he defies his father, played masterfully by Sir Laurence Olivier, who is very unhappy to see his son attempting to step out of the role he was ""born"" to be, for to have received such a voice from God... has to mean that he must be a Cantor at the Synagogue.

The relentless pursuit of his dream, takes Neil Diamond from New York to California, leaving behind his wife, a woman he grew up with and was supposed to be his companion for life.

But the wife does not follow the husband's dream, she was quite happy with all she had, a school, a Cantor for a husband, and a role... center stage in the lives of the families that formed the congregation of their synagogue.

In California, Neil Diamond meets Lucie Arnaz, playing the role of the vibrant, go-getter young woman who, upon hearing him sing for the first time, knows she is meant to see him achieve his dream.

They fall madly in love and together set out to make a popular pop singer out of Yussel. At some point the wife comes out to California to try to take him back to New York and some of the lines between these two women are simply superb. When the wife, played by Catlin Adams asks Lucie Arnaz about the relationship that is taking place in California... and how far it has actually gone, Lucie replies ""I offered him my body and he settled for a pizza.""

But Neil Diamond stays in California and one day is visited by the father who dreams of taking his son back to his beginning... back to continue the family tradition of being a Cantor. The son tells the father he must stay, and when the father sees the new woman in his son's life, he rips his clothing, a tradition to communicate that for him, his son is now dead!

In the end, the family is reunited, but some of the scenes between father and son are priceless jewels of attempting to step out of traditional roles.

A dear friend of the family visits Yussel and asks that he return in his role of Cantor for the festivity of Yum Kippur. His father is now too old and too ill due to high-blood pressure to sing. He says that Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, is the Jewish day of repentance, and reconciliation. So... there is no better time like the present for father and son to reunite.

When Neil Diamond returns to the Synagogue, he delivers some of the best lyrics of this movie... the song is deeply moving.

The movie opens and closes with the timeless classic ""America"" a song that for all of us, immigrants, reaching US soil in search of liberty, opportunity and the pursuit of happiness, this remains the most moving music of all.

As with Neil Diamond the best part of the movie are the songs, and here we get the best of Neil Diamond.  Hava Nagila, Adon Ojom, You Baby, Love on the Rocks, Amazed and Confused, Summer Love, Hello Again, Acapulco, Songs of Life, Jerusalem, Kol Nidre ""My Name is Yussel"" and America.

40910,5,078201061X,"This is a marvelous experience!  I first saw ""The Jazz Singer"" in 1980 in the cinema and was immediately hooked on Neil Diamond.  It was gratifying to find a Jewish story on the big screen, too, with Shabbat and Yom Kippur services and Hebrew songs, juxtaposed with Diamond's secular hits.  Looking back after 26 years of life experience and three extended stays in Israel, I can't help but to have warm memories of this movie.  The story, in my opinion, was sufficient to maintain interest, and although the acting was either VERY method (and who can forget Olivier's ""Eye Heff No Son!!""--how often has THAT been passed into popular culture such as ""The Simpsons!"") or painfully amateur, this film is eminently enjoyable.",1151625600,4,722,4.89344262295082
40912,2,078201061X,"This is what happens when musicians (at least most of them) foray into fields in which they should not trod.  I had the great fortune of seeing Neil Diamond ""live"" shortly after the release of this movie and, like always, he brought down the house.  He just may be one of the greatest entertainers who ever graced a concert stage.  As a singer-songwriter, they don't make 'em better (Remember that he honed his craft during the golden age of the late 60's at the famous Brill Building in New York City where artists such as Carole King & Gerry Goffin, Howard Greenfield & Neil Sedaka and Phil Spector (to name just a few) were also honing THEIR crafts).  The point is that Mr. Diamond is second to none in the field of Rock/Pop Music and the day he stops recording and entertaining will be the music industry's huge loss.

As for this movie - Let me just say this:  If you take away the music sequences, what you have left is some of the most horrible stuff ever seen on film.  This movie is so inept that even a legend like Lawrence Olivier (who plays Cantor Rabinovich, Mr. Diamond's jewish father)stinks.  His acting is so 'hammy' that it's embarrasing.  I mean, when he blurts out ""I hef no son!"" after realizing that his son (Mr. Diamond)  is sleeping with Ms. Arnaz, I lost it!  And Lucie Arnaz?  Oh my!!  How about ""I DON'T Love Lucy""?  Her acting is so amateurish that it's hard not to giggle.  And this 25th Anniversary edition dvd is not that impressive, either.  The picture quality is poor (very grainy).  The sound quality is very good, though, but the DTS will not be appreciated unless you have the surround sound system to accommodate it.  My advice is wait for a year or so until this movie comes down to $9.99 (which it will) - Even though it does have some fine extras, it just isn't worth the current price.  The best part of the film?  The ""Songs of Life"" sequence.  A beautiful song and a touching moment in this otherwise awful film.",1146528000,6,1956,4.438202247191011

West Omaha. It was a jewish kind of suburb without the little hats. I can flat sing, DO NOT ARGUE WITH ME ON THAT ONE!!!! I write my own songs about all kinds of things. I write about birds, bowling, canned peaches, why all the countries around russia have different names now and why a ref cost Nebraska the national title in 94 against FSU. I can do that where maybe you can not. I have the ability to make changes on the fly. My story is very similiar to Neil Diamond's character. I grew up in Nebraska, spent some time in Dallas and settled in east G-town. I never recorded an album and have only been to California once. So you can see where I relate to this film. I do like to sing though, as you can tell by my wonderous tales of bands I've fronted. Let me tell you about another one. I've always been a Neil Diamond fan, so I fronted a speed metal Neil Diamond cover band called Moldy Applecore. We took Neil's music and sped it up. When you have Jabs playin leadbass like his kids are being held hostage by Mayor McCheese, Kroll drumming like he's being chased by a drunk fat girl and me belting out Diamond standards like I wrote them, the world is your audience. We sold out the Gretna bowl in 3 minutes last summer. We played a 52 minute version of ""America"" that included several america themed songs stuck in to change tempo. We threw ""Grand old Flag"" and ""Born in the USA"" in the second 20 minutes of the song. The crowd went nuts and felt more patriotic than when Kerrie Strug ran into the pommel cow when he hip broke in 95.

This movie is the blueprint for moldy applecore. That alone makes it the best film of all time. I'm awesome, in case you were wondering.",1144195200,2,1872,4.168508287292818

However, the music is what this movie is all about. It was opportunity to showcase Neil's true self. A absolute for any Neil Diamond fan. Music from this 26 year old film still stands well today",1138579200,2,347,4.1940298507462686
40961,2,078201061X,"A year ago I bought ""The Rose"" and wondered if Neil Diamond's bid for big-screen success ever made it to DVD.  Then I saw a used copy going, to my horror, for 54 freakin' bucks at a local music/video store.  Fortunately this rerelease came out without my taking the very silly plunge I am all too capable of.

I like Neil OK, but not so much that I could ever let myself give this four or five stars.  On the other hand, this movie is far from the disaster critics said it was.  Diamond is no, well, Laurence Olivier, but in my view does nothing so bad to deserve ""winning"" the Golden Raspberry award for Worst Actor of 1980.

As for Olivier, I gotta wonder why he did this movie.  I have to agree that his Yiddish accent is spotty at best.  Sometimes he successfully evokes the old men back in my synagogue, one of whom actually smacked my friend for mispronouncing some Hebrew while praying at my Bar Mitzvah.  (Good times.)  Other times the accent slides into something from Ren and Stimpy.  Also, his character and that of Neil's wife are so one-dimensional and humorless that ""Jess Robin""'s choice between his cantor past and the lure of pop stardom is telegraphed from the outset.  In my experience, Orthodox Jews can be exceptionally witty and multi-dimensional as well as rigid and disciplined.  You'd never know it from this script.

Much better written is Lucie Arnaz's role as a pushy, clever agent Neil meets in L.A. and falls in love with.  She is definitely the life of the movie.

Nice little moments:  unspoken awkwardness when Arnaz proudly presents Diamond with a ham dinner he can't eat; Olivier reaching up to kiss the Mezuzah absent from Neil's L.A. doorway.  Scary little moments:  ""partying"" with Franklin Ajaye and homies with a song about...the Robert E. Lee!; the bearded, whiskey-bent and heck-bound Neil running off to wow the yahoos in a COUNTRY & WESTERN bar (big song:  ""You Are My Sunshine""!)

Of course, the best scene is when Olivier tears his clothes and cries out the Hebrew prayer of mourning when he finds Neil living with shiksa Arnaz.

Watch for Paul Nicholas, then only 2 years removed from his own Top 10 hit ""Heaven On the 7th Floor"", as a prissy pop star, and Ernie Hudson as Neil's antagonist in a really cringeworthy scene in the early going.

But don't watch for jazz.  There's not a note of it to be found here.  But ""The Pop Singer"" wouldn't have the same ring to it now, would it?",1135641600,4,2430,4.556581986143187

Movies that grossed far less then 27 million dollars(in 1980!).Movies that are long forgotten and won't be making their big DVD debut. The Jazz Singer is Neil Diamond's Purple Rain:Full of hits and concert footages between personal acting.

While this movie is a remake,It could be Diamond's story. The way an introverted Brooklyn songwriter becomes the outroverted,flashy stage presence in L.A.The way the character runs away from all his human relationships,opening up only in his music.""I sing my songs of life,and they will keep me from ever wanting,from ever needing"" Diamond sings in ""Songs of Life"" while trying to find himself.

But the best part of the movie is all the music. I especially love the versions of ""Amazed and Confused"" and ""You Baby"" Neil sings in a rock club. Much harder and better then the album versions. My favorite part of the movie is Neil showing a fake punk how to sing ""Love on the Rocks"".As soon as he opens his mouth,everyone is just moved by his bluesy,beautiful voice.

It's also based on the movie of the same title w/ Al Jolson in the 1927 version of it incl. the 1953 version. I haven't seen those 2 versions yet. But sooner or later I'll will.

Ok as I was gonna say this movie changed me since I bought on my birthday at 13 in Dec 1997 and that movie right there made me an instant to Neil Diamond to this day. I have bought the soundtrack of it on LP just before I bought the VHS. It's kinda good but it's more of a autobiographical film like I seen Bird, Jazz-A Film by Ken Burns, Ray, The Temptations, Mo' Better Blues, Malcolm X, Grover Washington Jr. in Concert and others.

Long story short, I luv the soundtrack, luv the acting, luv the sound and everything, but this is not something that nobody should hate or dislike. It's an enjoyable that every Neil Diamond must-have fan should have on their collection.

41040,1,078201061X,"To begin with, Neil Diamond could never sing. He has always ""talked"" his songs, he doesn't sing. Even on simply-constructed rock tunes, he has a totally grating, unmusical voice, no breath control, and the sense of rhythm of a polka dancer. Now, put him in a movie called ""The Jazz Singer,"" and what you get is something akin to casting Fatty Arbuckle as Errol Flynn. Diamond is a product of the commercial Brill Building, a heavily promoted performer of marginal talent. His acting is atrocious---laughable in fact. He has made an entire career out of the same three chord song structures and a voice that resembles the sound of fingernails scratching a slate board. Jazz singing is the territory of truly talented people like Mel Torme, Mildred Bailey, and Ella Fitzgerald. They had musical voices, impeccable phrasing, innate rhythm, and a vocal range that spanned multiple octaves (as opposed to Diamond's stiff, frog-like, off-key utterings). It's a joke, really, that Neil Diamond was even given this role. What's next? The cross-eyed, mule-faced Barbra Streisand playing the life of Heddy LaMarr? Hey, I've got some other ideas for those Hollywood producers: how about Sally Jesse Raphael and Jerry Springer as Clark Gable and Carole Lombard? Springer can play Lombard, and the gorgeous, sexy Raphael can play Gable. She already has the mustache. Then we can get Billy Crystal to play John Wayne. Finally, Alan Dershowitz should be given his acting break, don't you agree? How 'bout casting him opposite O.J. Simpson in ""Anything Goes?"" Hey, open your eyes. The liberal Hollywood freaks have made popular culture an oxymoron. There are no more absolutes, everything is relative. All criminal behavior is rationalized and the perpetrator exonerated via psychobabble like ""his Dad never plaed catch with him, that's why he's an axe murderer."" Ugly is now beautiful, stupidity is now erudition, and immorality is now a virtue. Anything goes so long as money can be made. Since the end of WWII, and especially since the drug-infested 1960s, we've allowed the barbarians to assume control of all social, political and cultural discourse.

The story is entirely unbelievable, set, as it is, in 1979/80.  Who could really empathise with the dilemma facing Jess in his struggle for independence from tradition (at the callow age of 38 no less!)

There are three redeeming features.  Lucie Arnaz is very engaging in a thankless role.  Neil Diamond shows that, while he can't act at all, he has a very charismatic stage presence in his musical numbers.

The third redeeming feature is the soundtrack.  Neil Diamond shows that his songwriting skills are of a high quality.  The performances in the film enhance their impact.

Songs like America, Hey Louise, Summerlove, Love on the Rocks and Hello Again are populist and extremely well written.  You Baby, Acapulco, Robert E. Lee and others are pleasant surprises and together ensure, unusually for film soundtracks, that the music here can stand independently from the film.  This probabl;y explains why the soundtrack grossed more than the film on its original release.

All in all, I would say: rent the film, watch the bits where Lucie Arnaz is on screen and where Diamond is performing.  On that basis it is worth 4.5 stars.  If you insist on watching the whole thing, I give it two stars.",1092960000,6,1317,4.769911504424779

Overall, though, if you're not a Neil Diamond fan (and even if you are), this film is pretty tough going.",976665600,3,687,4.846153846153846
41141,5,078201061X,"""The Jazz Singer (1980)"" marks Neil Diamond's theatrical debut as an actor, that is, unless you count The Band's ""The Last Waltz"", in which ND makes a cameo appearance. His performance in ""TJS"" as an assistant cantor isn't half-bad. Complimenting Neil's role quite nicely is an Oscar-winning caliber performance by the late, great Sir Laurence Olivier, who is stupendous as a stern, yet stubborn Jewish senior cantor. I've viewed this movie quite a number of times, and what I was expecting from the first viewing was an exact remake of the original 1927 version, but that wasn't quite the case, although I've never seen the entire original version. The premise of this version is sort of like the original, in that the premise of the story tells of an assistant cantor, Jess Robinovich, aka Robin (Diamond), who'd rather write and record songs for pure enjoyment and  please his soon-to-be-fan base than remain in the synagogue and please his senior-cantor father (Olivier). Catlin Adams (Rivka Robinovich) and Lucie Arnaz (Molly Bell) offer fine supporting roles as ND's present, then future ""significant other(s)"". Molly is first Jess' manager, then his future wife. The scenes focusing on Jess and Molly's relationship will tug at your heart strings, so it's nice to have a box of Kleenex handy. Comedian/Actor Franklyn Ajaye has a role as one of Jess' backup singers. Neil Diamond also wrote the songs that also appear on the soundtrack, and they're good ones: ""Love On The Rocks"", 'America"", ""Hello Again"", ""You Baby"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Kol Nidre"" and ""Songs Of Life."" It is also rumored that ND currently has a theatrical project in the works slated for release sometime in 2001. It's about time! Please don't wait another twenty years to release the next one, Neil! That's why all hard-core ""Diamondheads"" should include ""The Jazz Singer (1980)"" to their video collection, because a motion picture starring Neil Diamond is hard to come by.",976320000,,1943,5.071875
41144,5,078201061X,I thought this was a great movie!  I have been a fan since I was a small  child.  The music was wonderful and the acting wasn't bad either.  It  actually made me cry in two scenes.  It is worth owning if you are a Niel  fan!  Don't listen to the negatives...this is a great film!,965520000,2,279,3.9454545454545453
41146,3,078201061X,"Neil Diamond's 1st crack at the big screen found him in a typical  position. Keep on touring! Though this ""remake"" of the Jolsen  classic is slow at times, songs like ""Love on the Rocks"" and  ""Hello Again"" bring it all together. I found this movie  entertaining and even moving at times. Certainly worth spinning on DVD.  Great songs!",962323200,,334,4.689655172413793
41147,2,078201061X,"Guilty pleasure filmmaking at its finest. The story is as old as time, devoid of originality or insight. The acting is atrocious, even old salt Olivier. Ahh, but the music.....campy, overwrought, silly, yet compelling  as a train wreck.",957312000,4,236,5.2105263157894735
41148,5,078201061X,"Motivational, entertaining, and easy.  The film is complete in it's story, and is thus satisfying in an inspirational/motivational sense.  Technically, many films are better, but this movie satisfies the desire to  see someone attempt something, and to actually succeed.  Neil Diamond  is a (non-famous) cantor, who wants to be a (star-level) popular singer.  Opportunities come his way, and he pursues them.  Conflicts arise in his  marriage, and elsewhere, as a result of pursuing his singing career; and he  works through these problems.  And succeeds.  Therein is the greatness of  this movie.  Passion, pursuit, success.",950832000,4,625,5.5212765957446805
