8183378,2,B000O77LYW,"How this movie got an average of four stars is beyond me.  I'm not even sure how I managed to sit through the entire movie, but I just kept hoping it would get better.  The only reason why I even gave this a two star rating is because Lacey Chabert manages to slightly save the movie, but only barely.  Her role was marginally funny and at least she can act.  As for everyone else, I think they need to go back to acting school.  Either that or they were just going through the motions because they knew how bad this movie is.  The main character comes across as silly, selfish and careless (I mean what adult would even consider leaving a little girl at home alone, and then pays a man she's never met to watch that little girl while she uses the baby in her own selfish plot.)

The most surprising thing is that the main actress in this movie actually wrote the script.  Maybe that's why she took on the lead role because nobody else would want it.  I know I'm being mean, but it really was that bad.  The storyline was all over the place.  Nobody was really likeable.  The humour felt forced.  And the dialogue was sooooo boring at times.  I will admit the idea of the story may have sounded interesting, and with a better script it really could have worked.  I just wish I hadn't wasted ninety minutes of my life attempting to watch this.",1403395200,,1342,4.290836653386454
8183379,3,B000O77LYW,"There is a fun premise behind BE MY BABY that is never fully developed and a potential for a fun and charming story is missed.
It's a typical boy meets girl and find their is sparkling chemistry but a simple misunderstanding quickly breaks them apart. Girl volunteers at a Day Care center run by her mother and ""borrows"" toddlers in a scheme to make philandering husbands ""pay"" for their misdeeds. Sounds interesting and it certainly could have been a lot more fun that it actually was. The scheme begins as a misunderstanding that turns into a dedicated plan to get revenge. It's hard relate to a woman who creates elaborate scams to make some money and get revenge.
The movie is pleasant enough to watch but so much potential was lost in story.",1327276800,,746,4.616541353383458
8183380,4,B000O77LYW,"This was such a fun movie.  Outrageous premise (stealing babies from a day care!!??!!) that gets pulled off by a cast that really goes for it.  We are supposed to think that the main girl, Rylee, is a bad mamma jamma, but she is such a bumbler with a good heart that we can't help but fall in love with her, just like Max (AKA-the hottie) does in the end.  I love a happy ending, as long as I get a few laughs in there before the final kiss.  (Thanks for those gut busters, Julia Duffy and Rene' Ashton!)",1250035200,,504,4.0606060606060606
8183381,2,B000O77LYW,"Renee Ashton (and not Lacey Chabert as the packing implies) portrays a woman who was scorned by a married man and as a result, has an ingenious way of making all married men pay. Picking up married strangers in bars then going home with them and making them think they hooked up, she shows up a year later with a toddler from her mom's day care center in tow and demands cash to keep quiet. She has managed to accumulate quite a nest egg until she mistakenly tries to ply money out of a single guy who is on to her (particularly when she keeps showing up with a different kid) and wants to see how far it will go.

With a juvenile script and lots of former television actors in bit roles (a nearly unrecongnizable Julia Duffy plays her mom and the former Mr. J. Lo is the philandering best friend), this is a must miss from the first frame. The production values are cheesy, the acting is kind of second rate, and the heroine is so unsympathetic that it will be hard for viewers to feel anything for her but contempt.",1211932800,12,1017,4.269430051813472
