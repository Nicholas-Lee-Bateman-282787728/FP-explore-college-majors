8630839,5,B000C7RS6U,"The most refreshing aspect of Ken Jackson's documentary, ""Just Between Us,"" is the introduction of regional trailblazers in black gay America who have been telling their stories and encouraging their communities for a while. Viewers meet writer and poet Sharon Bridgforth, ""The Ski Trip"" filmmaker Maurice Jamal, and author Christopher David, who shares a painfully eloquent testimony about the loneliness and depression he felt before he decided to embrace all of who he is. Jackson also includes poignant snapshots of black gay writers Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Wallace Thurman, Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, Marlon Riggs and Essex Hemphill as well as gay civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. For anyone interested in learning a bit of black gay history and even more about today's leaders, this 78-minute film should not be missed. (RS)
