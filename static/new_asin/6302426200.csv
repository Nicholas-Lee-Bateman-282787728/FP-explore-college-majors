460985,4,6302426200,"I try to be impartial and unbiased when I write these reviews, but I can't  help but go on record to declare THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE as one of my  personal favourite animated films from Disney.  The fact that very few  people have seen it or don't appreciate it disappoints me.
The film may  be short on musical numbers, but for this kind of movie, that's probably a  good thing.  This film is rich in story and character development, as Basil  and Dr. Dawson search through the mouse holes and alleyways of London to  rescue a little girl's father from the evil Professor Ratigan.  The hard  and tough Basil is initially reluctant to have the girl Olivia accompany  him, but her sweetness and innocence grows on him over time, and begins to  appreciate her.  There's a lot of heart as well as adventure and suspense  going for this movie.  Now if only more people will take notice of it, then  that would truly be great!
THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE is only available on  video at the moment.  Let's hope Disney will release it to DVD in time for  the film's 15th anniversary next year.",962755200,2,1086,4.5
460986,3,6302426200,"My 3-yr old loves watching this video at Grandma's house -- understandable given the appeal of some of the characters -- Basil, Olivia, etc.  However, the bat and the rat -- the two main ""bad guys"" are way too  scary-looking and sounding for my taste.  Also, I think the theme of  Olivia's father being taken away from her and then Olivia herself being  kidnapped are too frightening for little ones.  My son is the type who may  not express his fears verbally but clearly gets fixated on the scary  characters and is wrestling with their meaning inside.  In turn, I simply  don't recommend it for impressionable little ones.",949276800,3,625,4.703703703703703

461125,5,6302426200,Probably one of the most under-appreciated Disney animated films. The Great Mouse Detective is a delightful caper that all ages can enjoy.,1516924800,,138,5.318181818181818
461159,5,6302426200,"I loved this movie as a kid and am happy to be able to share it with my kids. We all enjoy watching the adventures of ""Basil of Baker Steet"". The twists and turns of mystery are exciting and fun. There are a couple ""jump scares"" plus the villain, Ratigan gets pretty frightening at the end, so I recommend parents watching it with small children. The DVD arrived quickly and was in great condition. It made a great movie night!",1516147200,,427,4.35
461160,1,6302426200,"Quite frankly, I'm shocked that this movie has a G rating.  I hadn't watched it before and given the fact that it was made in the 80s, Disney and made for general audiences, I purchased it based on its high ratings.
If you are raising your children to be tender-hearted then you may want to look elsewhere, ignoring the high ratings that it has.
I gave this movie 1 star for the following reasons:

1.  FRIGHTENING:  There are scenes in the movie that are very frightening to little children.  For instance, a bat poses as a sleeping baby and snatches a little girl mouse and stuffs her in a bag.  In another scene, a big, fat cat eats a character alive.
2.  LASCIVIOUS:  There is a scene where a lady mouse gets up on stage in a bar with nice clothing on and all of a sudden removes most of it for all of the men mice that are watching and hooting as they drink.
3.  FIENDISH:  There is a very sadistic scene where the villain mouse creates a place that resembles a medieval torture room -- complete with a camera to film the death of the mice after it is complete.  Seriously?

The writers of this film had quite a twisted view of what little children would find exciting.  In fact, our smaller children neither laughed nor really appreciated the film.  It was more of a wide-eyed petrified stare during a good portion of it.  I kept thinking that it would get better but really, the wholesome scenes were not worth all of the other depravity they had to witness.

I am no fuddy-duddy.  I am not opposed to alcohol or bar scenes per say.  I am just upset that Disney wrote a movie for children that was not even really for adultsespecially for adults that consider themselves mentally stable.
You win some; you lose some.  I just lost $9.99 but I hope this review helps other parents that are looking for childrens films for children that have a heart.",1514592000,3,1854,4.3841642228739

461166,3,6302426200,"Very nice Blu-ray presentation for this enjoyable (if middling) Disney movie.  The Great Mouse Detective has all the ingredients it needs to be a great film, but it unfortunately underutilized them.  Some characters are introduced but then discarded.  Some set pieces go under-explored.  The main villain plot veers a bit on the silly side after a wonderful introduction.  However, the characters are very likeable, the animation has the gorgeous Disney Hallmark all over it, and the content isn't afraid to lean a bit toward the edgier side.  You'll never see Disney characters smoking and drinking as much as you do in this flick (which, even by the '80s, was probably pushing the envelope for a family film).  Ratigan, voiced by Vincent Price, steals the show as the main villain, and is highly underrated in that regard.  The climactic fight scene in the gears of Big Ben is incredible, mixing CG animation with hand-drawn characters better than more recent attempts.

The ""making of"" bonus feature is neat, but this disk seriously needed new interviews, a commentary, or retrospective.  That's what really brings this disk's value down.  The film itself is worth owning, and having not grown up with The Great Mouse Detective, it was a pleasure to discover.  Fans of Sherlock Holmes will get a kick out of the references, lovers of hand-drawn animation will get their fix and lament the medium's petrified state in the US today, and Disney fans should see it for the novelty of it being the first Clements/Musker collaboration.

The disk itself gets a 2/5.
The movie gets a 4/5.",1503360000,,1583,4.950757575757576

461245,4,6302426200,"This was easily one of my favorite Disney movies as a child, though unfortunately that's pretty much where it stays.  This is clearly catered specifically to young children and their parents watching with them.  That said, I've always liked the philosophy that children are just less experienced adults, and this is a fine way to introduce them to mystery stories.  The characters are definitely well-done, even the clear lackies.
To briefly summarize the plot, this is an attempt at microsizing Sherlock Holmes for kids.  The detective Basil even lives under Sherlock's home.  Basil's rival, Ratigan, has kidnapped a very strange target: a local toymaker right on his daughter's birthday.  His daughter, Olivia, stays hidden during the traumatic struggle, but now all alone, she desperately searches for Basil of Baker Street, who had already famously solved another baffling disappearance.  Dr. David Q. Dawson (obviously the Watson stand-in) finds her and helps her find this great detective.  Basil wants nothing to do with a mere ""lost father"" until he learns the kidnapper was Ratigan's main thug.  Unable to conclusively apprehend the ""Napoleon of crime"" for many years, Basil eagerly takes up the case.
The plot is not the most stellar, but it still does a fine job.  Sherlock fans will recoil at the ""idiot Dawson"" trope, though.  There's plenty to keep the attention of young kids, and parents will just adore Olivia, a true personification of pure innocence.  There's nothing here to really interest anyone else, though.",1488499200,,1531,5.204081632653061

Set in late 1800s London, a little Girl mouse, Olivia Flaversham enlists the help of Basil of Baker Street, the great mouse detective, and his assistant, an ex-army mouse named Dr. Dawson, after her father is kidnapped by a pegged legged bat, lackey of the world's greatest criminal Mind, Professor Rattigan. With great writing and amazing songs and music by Henry Mancini, a wonderful cast featuring Vincent Price as the evil Ratigan, it's also a wonderful retelling of Sherlock Holmes with anthropormorphised animated mice that live and work just below the legendary fictional detective. Great fun for all ages. Only reason I did not rate this a 5 is it was missing some of the old extras, like the 2 old Mickey Mouse shorts.",1483920000,,808,4.73758865248227

461571,4,6302426200,"The 80s are not known as a great time for Disney animation.  And that decade did bring us the worst Disney animated movie of all time.  But there are also some fun movies from that time that are often overlooked.  One of those is The Great Mouse Detective (rereleased as The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective.  Dont be confused, its the same movie).

As with many Disney movies, this one is based on a book or series of books.  Those books follow the adventures of Basil of Baker Street, a mouse who just happens to live at 221 1/2 Baker Street.  While I have never read the books, this movie is fun.  The connections between Basil and his human neighbor Sherlock Holmes are quite striking, and any fan will be thrilled to notice them all.

The story opens as Dr. David Dawson (voiced by Val Bettin) is trying to find a place to stay after returning to London.  He happens to stumble across Olivia Flaversham (Susanne Pollatschek) who is trying to find Basil (Barrie Ingham).  Seems that her father, the toymaker Hiram (Alan Young) has been kidnapped.

Basil has no interest in the case until her figures out that Hiram was kidnapped by Professor Ratigan (Vincent Price), his arch nemesis.  And Ratigans plan is truly evil, involving a plot to kill the mouse queen at her diamond jubilee and take over mousedom.  Will Basil track him down in time to stop him?

Just in case there was any doubt about Basils inspiration, there are a couple of scenes where he takes the smallest clue and deduces correctly information from it.  Theres also a voice cameo by the late Basil Rathbone as the real Sherlock Holmes.

But this movie doesnt forget that the primary audience is kids, so it features lots of action.  The plot follows logically from what came before.  It may not be the most complex mystery, but it works for the 75 minute movie.  It certainly keeps you entertained as you wonder just how Basil will save the day.

There are three songs here, two of them given to Ratigan.  Frankly, those are some of the greatest Disney villain songs.  You just cant help but laugh at them.  The song in the bar is also fun.

Yes, you read that right.  In their quest to track down Ratigan, Basil and Dawson head to some of the bad parts of London.  While that may bother parents with very young kids, I think most everyone will get the implied lesson that this is a part of town you avoid.  Besides, apart from some drinking, nothing truly bad is portrayed.

On the other hand, parents might be more concerned with Fidget, the bat sidekick to Ratigan.  Both he and Ratigan can be a little frightening.  On the other hand, they can also be comic characters.  I think most kids will be okay with them, but parents might want to watch it first themselves.

Apart from Vincent Price and Alan Young, I don't recognize any of the names in the main cast.  But everyone is great in bringing these characters to life.

The animation is mostly flat backgrounds and characters.  Its still a few years away from the rebirth that would happen at the end of the decade.  But I quickly lose myself in the story and forget about that.  The opening shot of the fog in London is pretty impressive.  This movie is also notable because it features the first use of computer animation in a full length movie.  This happens in the climax as the hand drawn characters interact with computer generate gears.  Its seamless, so you won't know.

The Great Mouse Detective isn't the best of Disney animation, but it certainly deserves to be better known than it is.  If youve missed this movie, track down a copy today.",1432425600,,3586,4.528861154446178

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Many of the new releases of children's animated films, are so saturated with powdery sugar that one suspects just watching them will produce cavities. What a treat it is to see an animated feature that doesn't moralise or patronise young children, or drown them in bathos. With The Great Mouse Detective the people Disney have gone back to the basics that have delighted children and their parents for half a century.

The story takes place in London in 1897. The star is Basil of Baker Street, a brilliant, arrogant and neurotic little Sherlock Holmes of a mouse who plays the violin and is determined, as much out of vanity as virtue, to defeat his evil archenemy, Ratigan. Ratigan uses his evil genius to try to conquer all mousedom. Dr. Dawson, a chubby somewhat blustery mouse aristocrat, recently employed on Her Majesty's Service in Afghanistan, becomes Watson to Basil's Sherlock and the two are engaged to help a poor little girl mouse get her father back. The father, a toy maker who is the film's working-class hero, has been kidnapped by Ratigan's peg-legged bat henchmen. The toy maker is forced to help with a nefarious plan to kill the mouse queen and put Ratigan in control.

Unlike many modern cartoons, this story does not take place in never-never land but in a real place, at a specific time. It makes reference to historical figures like Napoleon and literary ones like Sherlock Holmes, giving a much appreciated intellectual grounding. Instead of cheap magic tricks to solve all problems, Basil wins in the end by the force of his intelligence. ''Is there a chance to get her back?'' Dawson asks, disconsolate after the little mouse has been kidnapped by the bat. ''There's always a chance, doctor,'' says our hero, ''as long as I can think.''

Small children may be afraid of some of the bad characters, but the Disney Studio's gift for creating really nasty bad guys means that they are scary, but they will love the cute, brave mice and cheer their triumphs. Adults will enjoy the wit and style. This adult really appreciated Basil's straightforward approach. ''No one can have a higher opinion of you than I do,'' he says to Ratigan, the king of crime. ''And I think you are a slimy, despicable sewer rat.'' That's telling him!

Of course this isn't always a good thing. While for the most part the animation is very fluid, especially the celebrated battle between Ratigan and Basil amidst the cogs and gears of Big Bens interior, because certain movements, such as when the dog Toby charges away from the camera towards the horizon, look awkward and jarring.

The animated films greatest strength comes through the bright, consistently entertaining vocal work; there isn't really a weak link in the cast, with the possible exception of Susanne Pollatscheks performance as Olivia. Barrie Ingham owns the role of Basil, evoking both the characters intelligence, tenacity and egomania perfectly. As his trusted sidekick Dr. Dawson, Val Bettin (who would bring The Sultan to life six years later in ALADDIN), was perfectly cast as a character with a heart of gold who is mostly out of his depth. Of course, the films greatest performance comes from the late Vincent Price, whose Ratigan is the ultimate megalomaniac blowhard. Like all great villains Ratigan is immensely colourful, dominating the entire film and usually overshadowing the hero. Its strange that Ratigan is never included when people talk about great Disney villains; he really is a memorable creation.

An entertaining albeit slight feature, The Great Mouse Detective gives us an engaging caper plot with effective visuals and voice work. Its an important entry in the Disney canon to return to for its historical status in the studios evolution. It stands as the film which corrected the companys errors from the immediate past, and paved the way for the artistic explosion that was to come in the immediate future.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'The Great Mouse Detective' gets a very decent quality restoration from Disney is a very solid 1080p encoded image, with a very nice 1.78:1 aspect ratio and will please fans with its relatively clean appearance. Colours are nice and bold though. Much bolder than I remember them being on the previous inferior DVD release. Colour fills are nice and solid, even with the heavy grain. There are a few colour fills that fluctuate in colour shades causing that part of the image to flicker just a tad. In my opinion, besides a few instances of noticeable scratches, it looks like the film had been nicely cleaned of any outside distractions and overall this Disney releases is a very solid presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Disney 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix certainly gives a very expanding and enjoyable listening experience, but doesnt quite have the same effect as it did with 'Cinderella' or 'Snow White,' so giving 'The Great Mouse Detective' a decent audio mix that never has any really impressive moments of note. What you do get are lightly mixed rear channels that feature some ambient sound like when Basil and Dawson visit a crowded dive bar. A fight breaks out and you can hear some of the commotion playing in the surround channels. Dialogue is centred right up front and is clearly heard. I didn't notice any hissing or static on the mix. Everything sounded as clear as it possibly could. Overly loud sound effects were really the only aspect of this mix that I found a tad troublesome. They did drown out dialogue on a few rare occasions.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: So You Think You Can Sleuth? [480i] [1.33:1] [4:40] This is a mini-history of the detective in fact and fiction and then a brief mystery of the missing cookies caper for the viewer to solve.

Special Feature: Disney Songbook: The Worlds Greatest Criminal Mind Sing-A-Long [480i] [1.33:1] [1:58] Here is provided with sing-along lyrics on the screen for viewers to sing along with Vincent Price as he  extols the virtues of being the evil nasty Ratigan. Presented in full-frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio, this heavily truncated version of the song offers a chance to see what the film looked like pre-restoration and in pan-and-scan format.

Special Feature: The Making of The Great Mouse Detective [480i] [1.33:1] [7:52] We go behind-the-scenes with the making of the Walt Disney Animation and includes contributions from the likes of Roy E. Disney; Glen Keane [Supervising Animator]; Henry Mancini [Composer] and Phil Nibbelink [Animator]. We also get to meet the actors behind the voices of the characters in the animation film and they are Barrie Ingham [Basil]; Val Bettin [Dr. Dawson]; Vincent Price [Ratigan] and Melis Manchester [Bar Room Mouse].

Sneak Previews: Cinderella [Diamond Edition] [Blu-ray + DVD] [1080p] [1.77:1] [2:08]. Disney Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3 [Blu-ray] [1080p] [1.77:1] [3:05]. Anti-Smoking Advert [1080p] [1.33:1] [3:05]. Disney Promotional Movie Rewards Advert [1080p] [1.77:1] [4:28] This section includes: Disney Parks Promo; Disney Secret of the Wings [Blu-ray + DVD]; Disney Cinderella II: Dreams Come True + Cinderella III: A Twist In Time [Blu-ray + DVD] and Disney PLANES [Blu-ray].

Finally, 'The Great Mouse Detective' will always be considered a second-tier Disney title to some critics, but I fell in love with this Disney Animation and now I love it even more now I have it on the ultimate Blu-ray edition and so in my opinion there is a lot to like about it. It's a much better prospect than say, the dismal and ghastly atrocious 'Home on the Range.' Plus again we get a very nice video transfer and totally solid audio, this one comes definitely top of my list. Highly Recommended!

461691,4,6302426200,"After the abject failure of The Black Cauldron, the Disney studio pinned their hopes on this uncomplicated little effort.  Unfortunately, with the removal of Ron Miller as the head of Disney studio (replaced by Michael Eisner), the budget for the Basil movie was quickly slashed in half.  Eisner was also responsible for changing the title from Basil of Baker Street to The Great Mouse Detective because he thought ""Basil sounded too English.""  Naturally, the animators were not happy with his heavy-handed tampering.  Fortunately, the movie did well at the box office, allowing the studio to forge ahead with The Little Mermaid.

This is a fun movie; the story involves the kidnapping of a single parent.  His ability as a toymaker falls in line with villainous Ratigan's(Vincent Price) desire to take over London (at least the part that's ankle high).  The toymaker's daughter, with the help of Dr. Dawson, convinces the great detective Basil to find her dad (and thwart the evil scheme of Ratigan in the bargain).  Basil is almost a genius, living downstairs from Sherlock Holmes (voiced by samples of Basil Rathbone speaking in several films).  There's loads of excitement, several songs, and a hungry kitty.  I have no idea how faithful they are to the books by Eve Titus but I suspect they aren't because this is the Disney studio and they are rarely if ever faithful to anyone's book.  Weirdly enough, the best character in this movie is the villain.  This is all Vincent Price's fault for making him so charming and nasty.",1416873600,,1530,4.93359375

461749,4,6302426200,"Taking place in London in 1897, Olivia (Susanne Pollatschek) is a young mouse celebrating her birthday with her father (Alan Young). However, the party is crashed when her father is suddenly abducted and Olivia is left alone. Assisted by Dr. Dawson (Val Bettin), they seek help from the brilliant detective Basil (Barrie Ingham). Basil quickly deduces that his arch-rival, Professor Ratigan (Vincent Price), is behind the crime and immediately starts to investigate.

I thought the film was pretty fun and enjoyable. The characters all around are likable. Of special note is Vincent Price as the antagonist who clearly relished the role and it really shows in the film. While not quite as polished as other Disney films, there is still much to be enjoyed here.

Released a year after the disastrous The Black Cauldron, The Great Mouse Detective helped Disney get back on its feet during an otherwise tough period for the studio. While not exactly the most classic Disney film, it is a good movie for all ages and families.",1410739200,,1022,4.970760233918129

461775,5,6302426200,"The Great Mouse Detective is one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's also one of the most under rated in my opinion. I think just because I love the story so much and it always brought up good memories, this was the funniest Disney animated movie I had seen at the time. It's just such a cute film, it has fun animation, catchy songs, and such a touching story that anyone could easily fall in love with. My parents and I watched this movie together all the time when I was a child, still to this day, I don't mind sitting down to watch it, it's just that much fun.

A young little mouse girl and her toy shop father are celebrating her birthday, but her father is quickly taken away by a rotten gang of mice who are led by a giant rat, Ratigan, who is planning to over throw the queen and become leader of the mouse world. Olivia, the daughter, goes to Basil of Baker Street, he's a mad detective who has been chasing Ratigan for a long time. Along with the help of an average mouse, Dr. Dawson, Olivia, and Basil go after Ratigan to make sure that his plan fails.

The Great Mouse Detective is such a cute film. I'm very sure that you'll enjoy it, it's one of my personal favorites, I really do think this is one of the better Disney films and is an under rated treasure. I just loved Basil, his madness was just so funny and enjoyable to watch. I also loved Ratigan's song of why he is so great, not to mention how he thinks he's a mouse is just priceless. This is a fun family film to watch, I highly recommend it.

my daughter enjoyed it as well.",1394323200,,112,3.52
461801,5,6302426200,"When I was a kid this was one of my favorite movies. My brother and I knew pretty much the whole script backward and forward and inside out. We knew all the songs and sung them loudly, dancing through the house. Even our parents enjoyed it because there were a few jokes which only Sherlock Holmes lovers and adults would catch. We wore out our VHS tape around the time DVD's were introduced, but they did not make a DVD of this yet so we didn't get one to replace it. We grew up and completely forgot about this cartoon.

Then I got pregnant 3 years ago and came across this DVD in a baby store! Oh my God! A wave of nostalgia hit me like a ton of bricks and I had to have it. I couldn't wait to get home and watch it. In all the years I hadn't been watching it, I'd forgotten the plot. I just remembered loving it as a child and knew I wanted my child to watch it too. I took it home and watched it.

I cried non-stop through the whole thing. The little girl separated from her father was too much for my pregnant hormones. I'd lost my father a year before I got pregnant and through my whole pregnancy could think of nothing except how my dad will never meet his first grandchild. Actually, 2 years after her birth, I still think of that at least once a day... but anyway... If you are an adult who has lost a parent, be prepared to shed a few discreet tears as your little ones cheer on Basil during his search for Olivia. When father and daughter are reunited, I cried more than I had in years. I'm sure my hormones had something to do with it but I am not a big movie crier. Disney just has a way of bringing it out in me or something because to this day I cannot watch The Rescuers or The Fox and The Hound. If you are a big softy like me, have the Kleenex nearby!

This is definitely a family film and appropriate for kids age 6 and up. I say age 6 because for younger kids the idea of being kidnapped and some other action scenes might be too scary. I tried showing this to my toddler and some of the darker scenes had her covering her head with a blanket and screaming, we didn't get 15 minutes into the movie.",1393286400,2,2120,4.042857142857143

461812,4,6302426200,"Disney Studios 26th full length animated feature film. The Great Mouse Detective is a decent entry in the Disney animated film cannon with some interesting voice choices and great animation. This film marks the first time Disney married hand drawn animation with CGI and the results are very impressive. It also marks the first time I've ever heard a Disney character utter the word C R A P !? Ha-ha! I stopped watching Disney animated films around the time The Fox and the Hound came out so I am not all that familiar with the films from that period(until The Little Mermaid). Ever since Disney had started the Xerography process with 101 Dalmatians their films while still excellent quality just didn't have the Disney luster from the early years. They seem a little too 2D for my taste.

OK, now about the film and video releases. I own the original DVD release and the new Blu Ray and the Blu Ray is a very pleasing upgrade with much richer colors and while the picture shows some grain, that isn't a bad thing because do we really want these films looking like a brand new feature? The film was released 1:66:1 on the old DVD and the new Blu Ray is 1:78:1, there isn't all that much difference, but the use of the original title card is nice to have restored to the film.

The extras? well there isn't anything new worth mentioning, but at least there is a very short 'making of' featurette ( a little over 7 minutes) which I think every one of these films should have gotten. There is room for more on this release, even if it were just some mouse or other relating cartoon shorts from the WD vault. All in all the film looks better than ever and we get the correct aspect ratio so who am I to complain?

If you must own Disney's The Great Mouse Detective the  Blu Ray is the way to go. It's about as good as this one is ever going to get and I wouldn't hold my breath for another upgrade any time soon.",1385510400,2,1909,4.338935574229692

I believe with the plethora of Holmes remakes currently available for adults, this is the charming addition: a children's version. It is based on the story 'Basil of Baker Street' and has some parts/ characters that may be a bit scary for tots, but nothing outside of the Disney norm. The villain is voiced by Vincent Price and is delicious even amongst the other Disney baddies. He also gets the best song on the piece. Even as an adult I think this film is a delightful Disney confection. I believe it would stand up even without my nostalgia.

I'd recommend it to anyone with kids, and any Disney movie aficionado.",1369440000,4,743,4.544776119402985

Not just for children, this should please any Sherlock Holmes fan who likes seeing non-canonical tributes to the ACD canon.",1368835200,3,518,5.4875

461864,4,6302426200,"At first glance, among finally being released from the Disney vault once again, this would appear to be the 2002 DVD release with a couple of bonus features (like the bonus Disney shorts and the Great Mouse Detective Scrapbook) removed and a new package job. However, the film itself has received a much better transfer and restoration than the 2002 DVD. The colors are more natural, there is a bit more picture visible to the sides, and the soundtrack also plays in full (for some reason, the 2002 DVD muffles the music near the end of the film.) In addition, for the first time since it's original theatrical release, the ORIGINAL 1986 TITLE CARDS are shown at the start of the film. (I don't know if any other reviews of the ""Mystery in the Mist Edition"" DVD mention this yet.) All previous home video releases since it was first released on VHS in 1992 have used the 1991 reissue title card, ""The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective."" Not so here. It was a real treat to see how the titles originally looked back in the 1980s!

Aside from that, this is a very fun Disney film. During the 1980s, the Disney animation studio was struggling. This movie was successful enough at the box office in 1986 to convince Disney had a future in animation after all, and helped pave way for the Disney Renaissance from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. It has likeable characters, a very classic look and feel to the animation, a great music score (complete with each main character having his/her own theme music), and some fun songs (especially ""Let Me Be Good To You,"" which has something you'd expect more from a much newer Disney animated film! Then again, two of this film's directors did direct some of Disney's hits like ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Princess and the Frog."") It has surprisingly no romance, but it's got laughs, drama, action, thrills, a few small jump-scares (like Fidget's evil peek-a-boo act at the start, which the ""Dramatic Prairie Dog"" audio could perfectly accompany), excitement, and of course mystery (along with the character Olivia Flaversham having no mother :P ) The early CGI used during the Big Ben interior sequence also still holds up very well to this day. Vincent Price also does an excellent job voicing Professor Ratigan. So in short, this is definitely the best pre-Renaissance Disney animated movie of the 1980s.

I do like how they at least included the old ""Making of the Great Mouse Detective"" special featurette, but other than that, it was lacking in special features. Just a cheesy new game, the ""World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" singalong (also carried over from the 2002 DVD), and a couple featurettes about Blu-Ray and stuff. I would've at least loved an audio commentary by the film crew or something (Clements and Musker still work for Disney, so they would be obvious candidates!) So I give the movie five stars, but this DVD only four stars due to the special feature factor.

So if you did not buy the film yet on DVD, or if you just want a better-looking transfer of the film than the 2002 DVD, I highly recommended this. It's also currently available in a DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack as well!",1360108800,2,3156,4.713768115942029

461947,4,6302426200,"The Great Mouse Detective came out in a period when WDAS was struggling to stay relevant. After Walt's death in 1966, the animation division released movies that were not widely embraced as their previous efforts. One year before TGMD came out, The Black Cauldron was a box office bomb and became one of Disney's least successful and most forgotten efforts. TGMD had the task of taking away the bad taste The Black Cauldron left in moviegoers and became the next ""Disney Classic"". While it didn't accomplish that, nevertheless TGMD is a fun adventure with great action and superb characters. When a toy maker is mysteriously kidnapped, his daughter enlists the help of brilliant detective Basil of Baker Street and his colleague Dr. Dawson. They realized that this crime was perpetrated by no other than Basil's archenemy, Professor Ratigan. Basil and Co. will have to run against time to stop Ratigan and his evil plot of destroying the British Empire.

TGMD offers a kid friendly version of Sherlock Holmes and while its story can be a little forgettable and lacks some of the magic Disney's classics have, it offers good entertainment and has some great character animation! Ratigan is a marvelous creation and one of the best Disney villains ever. TGMD may not be a Disney classic but still has some nice moments and offers good entertainment for the entire family.

Video & Audio
TGMD has a nice looking transfer that remains faithful to the original source but it's not demo quality like other Disney BDs. Some specs appear from time to time but generally the transfer looks clean, detail is strong and colors are well reproduced. It's not a spectacular transfer but still it's quite good.

The 5.1 DTS-HD MA fares a little better than its video counterpart but it's still very front heavy. Still, dialogue is always clean and there are not any hisses or other unwanted noises.

Bonus Material
Sadly, because this is a very obscure title, bonus features are really scarce. Here's what's included:

""The Making of The Great Mouse Detective"" is a very short featurette made around the time of the film. Is worth a look because is the most substantial feature in the set.

""So you think you can sleuth?"" is a not very amusing game.

""World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" sing-along

A DVD copy is also included.

Closing Thoughts

One of Disney's more underrated films receives and adequate but not perfect BD release. Still, fans of the films or Disney lovers will want to add this film to their collections. Recommended.",1352851200,2,2520,4.894366197183099

461949,4,6302426200,"Disney is continuing their trend of releasing everything in high-definition with 1986's ""The Great Mouse Detective."" Based on Eve Titus's ""Basil of Baker Street"" book series, the movie paved the way for the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s. A great mix of adventure and humor makes this an entertaining homage to the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes.

Master of Disguise and detective Basil of Baker Street lives under the home of his sleuthing hero, Sherlock Holmes. The sinister Professor Ratigan kidnaps the greatest toymaker in London to create a mechanical version of the Queen of Mice in a scheme to take over the country. Basil and his new sidekick Dawson embark on a rescue mission and must also find a way to stop Ratigan's evil plan.

As usual, Disney's high-definition treatment of this minor classic is superb. The electrifying colors and dark London city settings give this a spooky yet lively atmosphere. Even with a crystal clear picture that can sometimes bring out creative imperfections in the transfer process, ""The Great Mouse Detective"" reminds viewers why hand-drawn animated films continue to be celebrated even in a time when CGI and Pixar artists rule the box office.

The 5.1 surround sound mix ensures that every bit of dialogue, music, and sound effects are spread throughout your home theater. Two songs performed by Vincent Price will stand out for fans of the horror master's work. One other track entitled ""Let Me Be Good To You,"" is sung by Melissa Manchester and will no doubt strike a chord with fans of her other tunes. Consumers will be pleased with the audio for this release.

There are a few special features included in this collection. We get ""The Making of 'The Great Mouse Detective'"" and ""So You Think You Can Sleuth"" featurettes. The sing-along song, ""The World's Greatest Criminal Mind,"" allows children of all ages to actively participate in some musical fun.

""The Great Mouse Detective: Mystery in the Mist Edition"" 2-Disc Combo Pack will thrill all who are obsessed with owning every Disney film in its latest edition. It features a great high-definition picture and audio presentation combined with an adequate amount of bonus material.

I admit there are a few things I can't look at like Fidget's laughing in our faces or Ratigan's red eyes in the clock tower, but I memorized the pattern enough to avoid it. Basil, Toby, Ratigan, and Fidget are my 4 favorite characters. I love the music, the setting of London, everything! I also love the Big Ben climax, it's easily my all time favorite climax in Disney History. Ratigan's song ""The World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" is my favorite villain song.

Another little kid with a parent issue, seen it, taped it Disney

The film is OK.  The animation looked more like Saturday morning cartoon quality.  NOT Disney standards.

I am surprised they have a ""Making Of"" feature on this.  Some of the bigger Disney film blu ray releases have NOT had them, but this one does.  So, it does have this but since the film was not a huge hit there is nothing outstanding extra wise here.

And, for the last few years Disney had, key word here is HAD, been heavily promoting blu rays over DVD.  DVD releases have not had the features, etc.  NOW, Disney is cutting back on blu rays.  This year they are now going cheap on these.  Blu ray is just a plain blue disc, the DVD is plain jane silver.

Back of case when it give film information here they are promoting ""The Princess and the Frog"", which is a disappointment & now forgotten & gets mentioned BEFORE THE FILM THAT PUT DISNEY BACK IN MAJOR HIT STATUS 1989's ""The Little Mermaid"".

The answer for The Great Mouse Detective lies somewhere in the middle of these two titles. Honestly, this is a solid package and I'm quite pleased with Disney's efforts here. Most of my picture issue lay in the first ten minutes of the film. Far away shots are indistinguishable and soft, but this may lie with the source material because the rest of the picture is definitely up to par. The animation nuances from the original artists are all on display, colors are vibrant and well rendered, and the sound is crisp and clear.

It isn't as wonderful as I remember, to be completely honest, and there were some moments where my children were truly terrified (my daughter has this thing about children in peril) but overall this is a really good film.  It isn't particularly funny, so it isn't that type of cartoon.  Instead, it utilizes the best facets of Sherlockian wonderment to create a story that is a tad too copycat and yet completely forgivable.  From the aptly named Basil of Baker Street to the clever update on the Watson-esque character (Dr. Dawson), `The Great Mouse Detective' is fun and has charm and warms the heart, even after all these years.  The action scenes are well animated, especially the final one, which makes up for the seemingly lazy plot (Ratigan's scheme seems somewhat silly).  I also wasn't really a fan of the songs here, which is a shame since Disney is usually on top of those things.  Ratigan's theme song is like a poor man's version of Gaston's theme in `Beauty and the Beast'.  Overall, this can't touch `Feivel Goes West', which is much smarter and more engaging overall, but it is a fun blast from the past that one can still enjoy today.",1346803200,,1289,4.569565217391304

So, it isn't ""right"" or ""wrong"", it's just well reasoned or poorly reasoned.  Below, you'll see exactly why I thoughtfully gave this a 1-star.  As I concluded in my original review, Disney has a bunch of classics, this is NOT one of them.  I can't imagine who would compare it to Frozen, or Tangled, or Beauty and the Beast or any of the old Disney classics.  Those are 4- or 5-star gems.  This is a lump of coal.  Here's why:

ORIGINAL:  I was seriously disappointed in this movie.  We picked it to watch with a group of kids from 4-11 years old and none of them liked it.  It has some unnecessarily scary parts with scary faces popping up out of nowwhere.  Having your father violently kidnapped should be scary enough without the evil face popping in to get a scream.  If it had a good plot or art, I might have given it 2 stars, but it is lacking in every measure.  The strip tease act in the sleazy bar (I'm not joking.  This scene is in the movie.) is completely in appropriate for children, the lyrics were dark and sleazy and no good for me, let alone my 5 year old daughter.

The only thing I'd complain about is introducing the maid & the cabaret girl, because they never appear again. & killing the villain at the end is always lame (of course if Ratigan had lived, Disney would have probably made a shamefully horrible sequel).

The film is base children's book series Basil of Baker Street. The story begins at the Flaversham Toy Shop. It is Olivia's birthday and her father gives her a present. As she is playing with her new toy, Fidget comes in and captures her father. Major Dr. David Q. Dawson finds Olivia crying in a boot and the two find 221B Baker Street; the home of the Great Mouse Detective-Basil. Basil, Dawson, and Olivia, along with Toby (a basset hound) are off to find Olivia's father. In other words the game is afoot. The first stop is at the scene of the crime where Fidget is stealing royal guard's clothes from toy soldiers. While there, Fidget is able to kidnapped Olivia and takes her back to Professor Ratigan's hideout. Professor Ratigan kidnapped Olivia as an incentive to make her father to build the robot of Queen Mousetoria so he can use it to overthrow the real queen. In their quest to find Professor Ratigan's hideout, Basil and Dawson walk into his trap and Professor Ratigan schemes of a cleaver way of killing the two. Basil uses logic and mathematical deductions to get out of the trap. The group head over to Buckingham Palace to free the queen and to rescue Hiram Flaversham. Professor Ratigan takes Olivia hostage and flees Buckingham Palace. Basil, Dawson, and Hiram give chase. The climax of the movie takes place at the top of Big Ben where Basil and Ratigan have their final fight. When the clock bell tolls, the two fall to their deaths, however Basil has managed to grab part of the steering from the dirigible that Ratigan used to make his escape. All four return to Basil's home. An on going gag in the movie is Basil keeps pronouncing Olivia Flaversham's last name incorrectly. During the clock scene, the computer animation is great. The Great Mouse Detective helped launch the Disney Renaissance era. The Great Mouse Detective is a great movie to own and gets an AAAA++++.

462095,5,6302426200,"Below the home of Sherlock Holmes is that of Basil of Baker Street, the ""Great Mouse Detective"", and this is the story of his first adventure with Dr. Dawson, whom we can assume goes on to be Basil's partner as the mouse equivalent of Holmes' Dr. Watson. Playing out much like your typical Sherlock Holmes mystery, only in smaller scale, Basil and Dawson take up the case of a little Scottish girl (Olivia, also a mouse) whose father has been kidnapped by an agent of the nefarious Professor Ratigan! Along the way, Basil's amazing eye for detail and skill for disguise helps them track clues and escape deadly traps to save little Olivia's father and unravel Ratigan's latest plot to take over the mousey world. It's an adventure worthy of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself! Or at least a mouse-version of him.

Disney's greatest detective returns to DVD in this ""Mystery in the Mist"" Edition, which provides a visual upgrade and restoration of the original film title (the first DVD release was redubbed ""The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective""), but not much else to get excited about making a double dip for. Still, for the hardcore Disney fan (like myself) those are reasons enough, especially since it is one of the most affordably priced Disney animated classics on the market. There's also a cute little bonus feature that gives some history on private investigators, along with a goofy little test of your own detective skills. The real downer though, is the loss of some great bonus features from the previous edition. They included a gallery and two animated Disney shorts, one of which accompanied the film on its initial theatrical release. Thankfully, the very nice Behind the Scenes featurette from the film's original release era is carried over (along with a sing along song), but not including those other carry-overs is just inexcusable and forces us true fans to hang onto our original DVD as well rather than being able to resell it or pass it to someone else. Maybe that's the idea, but it's very annoying.

Anyway, the film itself, released originally in 1986 (and based on the Basil stories by Eve Titus), has the unfortunate stigma of being part of the dark period at Disney Animation, after Walt's death but before the Renaissance kicked off by ""The Little Mermaid"". That's not to say this film is bad, nor that any of those films are, for that matter. Folks who saw them in theaters, especially as kids, largely still seem to have made a connection to these films. I grew up during the so called Disney animation dark ages myself (and part of the Renaissance), and I loved every one of those films probably as much as any kid growing up with Disney in the 40's and 50's loved Pinocchio, Bambi, and Peter Pan, etc... ""Robin Hood"" was a huge favorite of mine second only to ""The Jungle Book"", and I certainly loved ""The Great Mouse Detective"". Now, were these films inferior to those of the Disney eras that preceded and followed them? Well, perhaps, but they were still better than any non-Disney animated features, and they were still all good, solid films with captivating characters and visuals. There was just something a little less epic about their presentations, such as not really having a unique style from picture to picture. Sometimes, emotions didn't run as deep as they could have, either, or there was a bit of an unfinished quality to the visuals. You could pick on different things for each film, but you also can still find reasons to love them all. Frankly though, ""The Great Mouse Detective"" could be the best of the bunch. Or, it's definitely near the top at least. No matter how engrossed in the story and characters you may be, it's unlikely the concerns of mice will ever feel as dramatic as those of human characters like Belle or Aladdin, and this is probably another issue that made things harder for most of the Dark Age Disney films, but there's really not much negative one can say about ""The Great Mouse Detective"". It certainly isn't as flashy as most animation today, but it has such a cool charm, like the best Sherlock Holmes stuff. Some say that it has the problem of a lack of anything truly memorable, and therefore that it is simply a good but forgettable film. Well, this will probably be different for each individual, as for me, Vincent Price's performance as the villain Ratigan and the little song he gets to sing is very memorable and delightful, as is one of the best scenes, in which Basil and Dawson have to try to escape from one of his elaborate traps. Basil(wonderfully played by Barrie Ingham) really is such a joy to watch when his mind is working! Then, there's the scene the Disney Company always tried to use to sell this film, the clock tower scene. In this sequence, we see what is claimed to be the first CGI animation integrated into a 2D animated feature. The moving gears inside the great clock, ""Big Ben"", were drawn by a computer, with Basil and the gang animated running amongst them. The fact is, this is very impressive, probably more because it doesn't look like computer animation than anything else. It is probably still the best job I've seen of using computer animation in a 2D film. It's pretty flawless.

So, with quirky characters and a great voice cast, music by Henry Mancini, and directed in part by two of the guys behind the Disney Renaissance features, ""The Great Mouse Detective"" is certainly worth picking up if you are a fan of Disney animation at all and especially of Sherlock Holmes as well. It's up to you whether or not it's worth upgrading if you already own the first DVD release, but who knows when we'll see they great little film come to Blu-Ray, so go for it if you want the best visual quality, but hang on to your older DVD too if you don't want to lose some great extras that foolishly were not carried over.",1281484800,,5833,4.666666666666667

Synopsis: When talented toymaker Hiram Flaversham is mousenapped, his winsome daughter  Olivia turns to the most famous mouse detective of them all, Basil of Baker Street.  Accompanied by his assistant and confidante, Dr. David Q. Dawson, Basil uncovers a  villainous plot by the ""slimy, contemptible sewer rat"" Dr. Ratigan to replace Moustoria,  Queen of Mice, with a look-alike robot and take control of the entire rodent population of  London. Based on Eve Titus's book Basil of Baker Street, The Great Mouse Detective
channels the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous creation into a richly  animated, Sherlock Holmsian tale set in Victorian-era London's underground mouse kingdom.

My Opinion: Gracie, my husband, and I took the time to watch this movie as a family.  While I remembered much of it, I had forgotten that there were a few dark parts in this movie.  Gracie fell in love with Olivia and really loved the Queen of Mice.  While I thought some scenes might be a bit scary, she didn't mind them at all and in fact, quite enjoyed the movie.

I enjoyed the restoration of this movie.  While it definitely does not have the animation or graphics of today's cartoons, the story line and creativity of the story is right on par with keeping a child's or family's attention.  Overall, my family definitely enjoyed this movie.  If you have a small child watching it, you might want to be aware of some of climatic parts and would definitely want to watch it with them.",1273017600,,1697,4.780068728522337
462162,5,6302426200,"This movie features a toon strip tease.  What's not to love?
Seriously, it's a very good movie which also includes computer animation (the clock scene).",1272326400,,152,5.08
462163,5,6302426200,"THIS IS A REVISED REVIEW COMBINING ELEMENTS FROM THE NEW BLU-RAY WITH THE EARLIER VERSIONS...

The Great Mouse Detective came along -- and was somewhat lost -- during a highly transitional period as Walt Disney Productions became The Walt Disney Company (see the fine new documentary, ""Waking Sleeping Beauty,"" for details). It's definitely worth more attention that it seems to get, perhaps because it gets left between the ""troubled"" post-Walt era and the ""second golden age"" that began essentially with The Little Mermaid.

The movie was originally called Basil of Baker Street, from the books by Eve Titus, but higher-ups at Disney (perhaps Jeffrey Katzenberg) wanted something more obvious. It prompted a humorous memo from Peter Scheider and the Animation Department, in which other Disney animated features were similarly renamed:

Seven Little Men Help a Girl
The Wooden Boy Who Became Real
Color and Music
The Wonderful Elephant Who Could Really Fly
The Little Deer Who Grew Up
The Girl With The See-Through Shoes
The Girl in the Imaginary Place
The Amazing Flying Children
Two Dogs Fall in Love
The Girl Who Seemed to Die
Puppies Taken Away
The Boy Who Would Be King
A Boy, A Bear and a Big Black Cat
Aristocats
Robin Hood with Animals
Two Mice Save a Girl
A Fox and a Hound Are Friends
The Evil Bonehead

Perhaps the only upside to the title change is that it inspired the memo.

Anyway, The Great Mouse Detective makes its third appearance on DVD, but first time in Blu-ray, with a two-disc set.

The film looks wonderful in Blu-ray (there is a literally clear difference) but the clarity also betrays some grain in the film. It also reveals the handmade nature of this cel-animated film, which is part of its charm. Even the historic Big Ben sequence, in which computers were used for the first time in a Disney feature, is hand inked and painted.

This is one of the Disney features that often gets overlooked in the vast catalog of classics, but it actually holds up well because it is so straightforward and unpretentious, like a lot of modern cel animation but more lush and fluid. It's
a Sherlock Holmes-inspired adventure with memorable moments and a nice score by multi-Oscar, Gold Record and Grammy winner Henry Mancini (his only score for a Disney animated feature).

Disney features have always had trouble with their lead characters being engaging enough and leaving the audience empathy on the shoulders of the sidekicks. In the case of Basil, he is true to the Holmes persona in that he is a bit prickly and distant, but he becomes more likable as you get to know him in the story.

Much was made at the time of the film's release of the casting of legendary Vincent Price as the villainous Rattigan. It was not his first time voicing for animation; he was the voice of Irontail in the Rankin/Bass special, Here Comes Peter Cottontail. Later, he played a version of himself in the better-than-average 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo.

Price's performance in The Great Mouse Detective is perhaps his most inspired for animation. He sings one of the few songs and really gives Rattigan a behavioral range. This is not the ham-fisted caricature acting often associated with Price. While Rattigan is larger than life to be sure, Price adds nuance and frighteningly low-key moments as well as the truly terrifying climactic battle at the end.

Price was the only ""big name"" voice in the film with the exception of Melissa Manchester, who sings in the saloon scene. The use of stars was not as common a practice then as it is now. Manchester was actually added to the soundtrack in order to generate publicity to ""today's"" audience, yet Disney did not release a soundtrack album or a single version of her song (Varese Sarabande released a CD years after).

Manchester replaced Shani Wallis, who was going to sing the song before being removed for the ""name."" Wallis was one of my childhood crushes as the doomed Nancy in the Oscar winning Best Picture, ""Oliver!"" At least she was given a small speaking role at the end of the ""The Great Mouse Detective.""

To fans of DuckTales, Mister Ed or Adventures in Odyssey, listen for the great Alan Young as the lovable toymaker whose genius for invention unwillingly spurs the ""crime of the century.""

If you're adding to your Blu-ray collection, you would do well to pick this up. But if you have the previous ""Mystery in the Mist"" edition, you already have everything on the DVD. And, if you have the original 2002 DVD, you have two extra cartoon shorts and a scrapbook.

462164,4,6302426200,"With vague, animated memories of certain scenes from Disney's The Great Mouse Detective dancing through my mind, I slipped the newly released Mystery in the Mist DVD edition into my player to share it with a new generation. This old school Disney film (originally released in 1986) combines classic animation with what was then some of the earliest combinations of computer-graphics with hand-drawn characters in some of it's most striking scenes.

My children were quickly immersed in the world of Victorian England, where a society of dignified mousies and nefarious sewer rats exists on miniature scale, complete with their own Queen Mousetoria at Buckingham Palace. When the notorious villain (and nemesis of the city's most notable detective, Basil of Baker Street) Ratigan kidnaps the young Olivia Flaversham's toymaking father, the mystery begins.

Basil - the Sherlockian deductive genius - combines his efforts with that of the genteel Dr. David Q. Dawson, as they spin through an ever escalating series of madcap adventures that leads to the uncovering of a scheme to unseat the Queen!

Based on the children's book series Basil of Baker Street by Eve Titus, this feature film seemed to be hinting at sequels to come, which unfortunately never materialized. This digitally restored film continues to captivate children with its nefarious plots and dastardly schemes.

Parents of children who are disturbed by separation anxiety should note the abrupt kidnapping of Olivia's father in the opening scene - a tension that continues throughout the film. A scene in which Basil and Dawson find themselves in a shore-side pub also includes some can-can style dancing and provocative singing (the yesteryear equivalent of a girlie-bar) which parents may want to be aware of.

The original bonus features, a making of segment and a sing-along feature of ""The World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" (sung by the villainous Vincent Price, Ratigan's voice talent) are added to with a brief history of the detective and an introduction to sleuthing in ""So You Think You Can Sleuth.""

This 74-minute film has been enjoying repeated viewings by my older children (my toddler finds it too dark, it is fairly intense). My seven-year-old in particularly is trying to award it 10 out of 5 stars. Not only can it still excite the imaginations of children, but adult devotees of England's most popular fictional detective will also find many inside nods to the realm of Sherlock's London found embedded within the film.",1271635200,4,2502,5.196029776674938
462165,3,6302426200,"The film's conceit - reimagining Sherlock Holmes and Watson as mice - is an inspired one and the filmmakers offer a few glimpses of how the mouse world mirrors the human one. The Great Mouse Detective is a good film but not a great one what with so-so musical numbers (including one sung by Melissa Manchester - remember her?) tempered with a memorable performance by Vincent Price.

There's not too much difference from the previous DVD release for this film. New to this edition is a pretty superficial featurette entitled, ""So You Think You Can Sleuth?"" It gives a brief history of detectives and highlights some of the most famous in history. It also gives a brief example of a mystery for you to solve.

Ported over from the previous release is all-too brief ""The Making of The Great Mouse Detective"" which traces the origins of the film. It took more than four years to make blended computer animation with hand-drawn characters for the first time in Disney's history. We see footage of the voice actors giving line readings while Vincent Price speaks highly of his character, expressing his joy at being able to appear in a Disney film.

Finally, there is ""'The World's Greatest Criminal Mind' Sing-Along Song"" which allows you to sing along with Professor Ratigan's song and dance number.",1271030400,7,1296,4.828828828828829

Dawson, like John Watson, is recently out of service in Afghanistan), and, like all societies, its crime, criminals, and dedicated battlers for justice, notably the great Basil, who lives in a mousehole neatly tucked into the foundations of 221B Baker Street.  When toymaker Hiram Flaversham--a genius with objects mechanical--is kidnapped from his home, his motherless daughter Olivia seeks out Basil in hopes of getting help in finding him.  Basil at first thinks such a task beneath him, but when he realizes that the crime was committed on orders of his nemesis, Prof. Ratigan, he plunges into the case with enthusiasm, accompanied by Dawson and (quite against his preferences) Olivia, plus Toby, the sniffing hound who often works for Holmes.

Basil isn't the most sympathetic of heroes--he seems to have most of his human model's weaknesses (arrogance, vanity, and an occasional tendency to self-pity not the least) and few of his virtues (except for courage).  But he's also brilliant, and with Dawson's stolid backing he follows the clues to an exciting climax that finds him pursuing Ratigan through the gears and escapements of the Big Ben clock and very nearly re-enacting (or perhaps more accurately anticipating) Holmes's plunge off the Reichenbach Falls.  Ratigan himself is a smooth yet scary villain, like so many of Disney's bad guys, and is wonderfully voiced by horrormeister Vincent Price.  (His henchbat, Fidget, may be even scarier, especially when he first bursts through the Flavershams' window.)  He also stoutly denies that he's a rat, even though he obviously is.

I will never forget how shocked I was to see the burlesque dancer take off her seemingly modest attire to reveal an hour glass half-dressed figure with a garter and blue fishnets. The reaction from the crowd, the sexual tension she created with her stripping- I wanted to be there!

This movie, set in late 19th century London, is based on the books ""Basil of Baker Street"", which were stories based upon Sherlock Holmes.  The movie does a good job of playing on both of these sources, and there are many jokes that a child will not get, but an adult will.  While the pacing is fast, it is slower and the story is more complex than one normally finds in a children's movie.  Some of the scenarios (such as the bar room brawl, smoking, etc) are not something you will find in children's movies today, for sure.  Those reasons are probably what have hurt the movie over the years, despite its excellence.

The film is loosely based on Eve Titus's book ""Basil of Baker Street,"" which recounts the adventures of a mouse living just adjacent the domicile of the incomparable Sherlock Holmes.  Disney concocts a bona fide mystery with a couple of stellar talents to voice the characters.

Professor Ratigan (voiced by veteran Vincent Price) has developed a plan to replace the Mouse Queen (Eve Brenner).  However, Ratigan needs the abilities of Hiram Haversham (Alan Young) to make his plan work.  When Fidget (Candy Candido) kidnaps Hiram Haversham, he overlooks young Olivia Haversham (Suzanne Pollatschek).  Olivia attempts to engage Basil (Barry Ingham), who is much like Sherlock Holmes, to find and save her father.

Basil and sidekick Dr. John Watson (Laurie Main) are soon on the hunt, aided by a hound and Olivia.  Basil and company soon discover Ratigan's evil plot in a rousing adventure that is sure to delight nearly every member of the family.

This movie is quite interesting.  I enjoyed the voice cameo by the late Basil Rathbone, who many consider the definitive Sherlock Holmes.  This movie maintains a quick pace and is sufficiently mysterious that even mystery buffs may enjoy it.

I did have one problem with this movie.  Basil smokes.  I realize that in that era many people did smoke, but when I saw Basil smoking, particularly in a Disney movie, I realized how much times have changed in the decades since this movie was made.  Perhaps you should watch this movie with your children and remind them that smoking is an unhealthy habit, and people in those days had yet to realize how nasty it was.

Other than that one difficulty, I highly recommend this movie.  Enjoy!",1140134400,2,1757,4.901694915254238
462281,5,6302426200,"The Great Mouse Detective -- Disney's adaptation of Eve Titus's book Basil of Baker Street -- is by far the best ""portrayal"" of Sherlock Holmes, both characters and adventures, for kids, teens, or adults...with the possible exception of Without a Clue starring  Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley [PG]. Both movies are true Holmes despite obvious differences, such as being a mouse.

The Great Mouse Detective can be appreciated on many levels.  It's great fun for kids, even if they haven't read, or heard, Eve Titus's Basil of Baker Street books. Basil is, of course, THE mouse counterpart to that greatest of detectives Sherlock Holmes. You could say he is Holmes' ""under study"" for the animal world, living literally ""under"" Holmes' residence in Baker Street.  The Great Mouse Detective is a superb introduction to Sherlock Holmes, but it doesn't take knowledge of Holmes to enjoy it immensely.

For an older audience, there is subtle humor that you miss as a kid, but is hilarious. The movie's a must for those who've enjoyed the great conglomerate, ""allusive"" humor in Shanghai Knights, such as Jackie Chan balancing and fighting using an umbrella to the title music of ""Singing in the Rain.""  Without seeing The Great Mouse Detective, no viewer can fully appreciate the humor of the ""fight in Big Ben"" scene in Shanghai Knights and the plunge from the face of the clock to the ground far below.

The fall to their ""deaths"" of arch villain and hero is a great example of another level at which The Great Mouse Detective can be appreciated. It's is ""straight out of Holmes."" No one well-read in Doyle's Adventures can fail to recognize the moment where Doyle ""kills"" Holmes off (or that he brings him back by popular demand). Basil has all Holmes' mannerisms, and the arch villain Ratigan is hyper-Moriarty. All the principle characters are there, and ""extras"" could be found in any number of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

So why is the movie not more widely known?  Perhaps for lack of expert hype and marketing. It's a movie that deserves more, unlike other recent Disney offerings. There seems to be no other reason. Disney, now famed for sequels, could do that too, if they brought back their artists (computers just can't get the same quality).  After all, there are other Basil of Baker street stories.  To match the humor and marvelous Holmes qualities of The Great Mouse Detective, however, would be a difficult task indeed!

His constant mutterings to himself, his attacks of energy or lethargy, and his friendship with the good Doctor are only a few of the obvious similarities.  Dawson's not absolutely perfect, but he's pretty close.  His astonishment with the Detective's deductions, his emotional responses, his willingness to do anything Basil tells him to do, and his fierce camaraderie and spirit when things aren't going well are his most Watson-like qualities.  But I'm just a kid.  You adults study it and tell me.  Why is it the best?  Perhaps it's because people can take more liberties with a cartoon, maybe the actors aren't embarressed to act crazy (which can be their absolute best) when no one actually sees them, I don't know.

Steeped in Victorian atmosphere, the mystery leads our hero from The Queen's palace to Big Ben and all points between. Voice cameos from Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes, and Laurie Main as Dr. Watson are a treat. Based on the Basil of Baker Street series of novels by Eve Titus and Paul Galdone.

462330,4,6302426200,"Based on the book ""Basil of Baker Street"" about a mouse and his sidekick and modeled closely on Sherlock Holmes, I thought this would be a natural for a family that loves the Holmes ouevre AND Disney films.  This is old-school animation with some impressive scenes, particularly the chase inside the workings of Big Ben, and the story of the kidnapped mouse toymaker is compelling, but maybe I'm turning into a wet blanket in my middle age, finding parts of the film to be fairly objectionable: namely, disturbing images during a battle in a toy shop, a bad guy who feeds incompetent underlings to a cat, and -- I'm not kidding -- a bar singer whipping off part of her outfit as the patrons ogle and try to grab her!  Does that really need to be in a Disney film?

Voice work by Vincent Price (and a voice cameo by Basil Rathbone) are great.  DVD extras include two cartoons (1937, 1945) featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, a making-of featurette (8 minutes), and a sing-along song.

The film can be heard in English, French or Spanish, and English subtitles are available.",1093996800,4,1077,4.617801047120419
462331,4,6302426200,"Among the selections of movies in the excellent Sherlock Holmes reference book `Sherlock Holmes on Screen: The Complete Film and TV History' by Alan Barnes is this 1986 Disney concoction that is equal part musical, comedy, thriller, suspense and children's movie. In fact, as Barnes points out, this feature has many more Holmesian elements than many live action movies that happen to have the character Sherlock Holmes among its cast list.

Indeed this clever animated movie owes a great deal to its literary roots and is based on Eve Titus' book `Basil of Baker Street.'

Living underneath the apartment of the famous Sherlock Holmes at 221 Baker Street is a mouse named Basil. Shaped primarily on the Rathbone interpretation of the character, Basil is the most famous detective in all of mousedom and is determined to track down his evil nemesis Prof. Ratigan (wonderfully played with obvious relish by Vincent Price).

Basil's chance comes when he is approached by the daughter of a kidnapped toymaker named Flaversham. Initially uninspired and uninterested in the girls search for her abducted father Basil becomes decidedly more interested when she reveals that one of those responsible is a bat with a peg leg.

The bat is a known as a henchman for Ratigan and soon Basil races off into another adventure to chase down the evil genius.

The animation in the movie is top notch, the songs lively and the humor - well funny, but where this movie falters a little is in pace. I would say it is just a little too long and slower paced than I expected. It's a very satisfying movie certainly, and a `must-own' for Sherlock Holmes fans (Basil Rathbone's voice is even heard in one scene), but there are moments where it seems to drag and other moments where you wish the characters would stop singing and just get on with developing the plot.

Great fun for the kids and people who are still a kid at heart/",1092960000,19,1908,4.766666666666667

The film has really nice animation especially the scene atop Big Ben.  The voice talent is great, especially the dastardly Vincent Price.  The villain is good, and very malicious and powerful.  The DVD is really good as well.  The movie is in a new letterbox treatment- very nice.  I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves the Disney film genre.",1085356800,,485,4.853658536585366
462333,5,6302426200,"How the Great Mouse Detective has not found a wider audience is beyond me. Perhaps it's because adults see the cover of animated mouses and assume it's just for kids, but looks can be decieving. I have screened this movie for several of my adult friends (without kids) with many of them running out and buying a copy for themselves after realizing what a truely enjoyable classic it is.
Although the Little Mermaid has been given the credit for Disney Animation's rise to greatness throughout the 1990's it really began with this teriffic classic. The Great Mouse Detective marks the first effort of Don Musker and Ron Clemants (The directors of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin). Although it has two catchy showtunes it plays more like a detective adventure story than the later musical classics of Disney animation. What sets this film apart is that it is character driven. Each character in the film has quirks and traits that play into the film's plot. The Great Mouse Detective is wildly imaginative and orginal. This film also has perhaps the most thrilling endings in Disney animation too.
So in parting I beg you adults out there without kids to give this little animated tale a chance, I guarentee you will not be disappointed.",1073692800,45,1234,4.8254716981132075
462354,4,6302426200,"This version of a Sherlock Holmes pastiche written by Eve Titus called ""Basil of Baker Street"" could not be better.
When a toymaker is kidnapped, his daughter must call upon the services of the greatest detective of the mice.  Basil quickly deduces that his arch-enemy, Ratigan (A rat that wants to be a mouse?  Who can understand that?) is at it again.
This great Sherlock Holmes type story lends itself well to the Disney animation technique.  Basil is enough like Holmes so that anyone who has read or seen even one Holmes story will recognize him.  His partner, Dr. Dawson, is so much like Dr Watson that it's almost funny.  Ratigan, in the role of Moriarty, makes a great enemy for Basil.  Basil gets help while rescuing the toymaker in time for Christmas from his daughter and a cast of mice that have banded together in the London underground.  Could this be the start of the ""Rodent Rescue Aid Society"" as seen in Rescuers and Rescuers Down Under?  It's never said outright, but it easily could have been.
Look carefully - there's a quick scene where we see the =real= Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  A cute bit that just added to the charm of this relatively undiscovered Disney classic.
A good way to start children on an appreciation of mysteries.  Worth looking at for adding to a library of children's movies, and well worth adding to a collection of Disney classics.",1070582400,7,1381,4.669421487603306

My favorite aspects are that it's an interesting story (a classic ""mystery"") with intelligent characters & clever dialog.  There are no gratuitous sidekick characters, no meaningless song & dance numbers.... everything fits together perfectly in this movie.  I initially wondered if my son would lose interest in the wordy, British-accented main character Basil, but nothing about the movie was over his head.  Even the villians (including a delightfully mean rat, voiced by Vincent Price) didn't overwhelm him.

But when her father is kidnapped, Olivia intends to get him back. Aided by Doctor David Q. Dawson (Van Bettin), they go to find the renowned, legendary detective, Basil of Baker Street (Barrie Ingham). At first Basil is reluctant to help her but when he discovers that his evil arch-nemesis, Professor Ratigan (Vincent Price) is behind Flaversham's kidnapping, Basil decides to investigate. As they follow clues and use 'elementary thinking', the mice try to outwit the evil Ratigan if they are to save all of mousedom!
An incredibly charming movie, Disney gives us a fun and entertaining film for all ages. When I was very young, I was an avid watcher of ALL Disney animation films. But I remember that besides ""Robin Hood"", ""Lion King"", and ""Aladdin"", ""The Great Mouse Detective"" was my most favorite! I used to watch over and over. Unfortunately, over the years I strayed away from watching the old Disney classics until just the other day when I was rearranging my videos. I came across ""The Great Mouse Detective"" and I remembering how much I loved it, decided to watch it. And my, it's amazing how well I remembered it! I was able to say all the lines and sing all the songs while still totally enjoying myself!
My point in saying all of this is that the old Disney classics are... well... classics gems! Nothing objectionable for parents to be aware of for their kids, just some romping good fun. ""The Great Mouse Detective"" has it all; mystery, humor, a great setting (London), action, and suspense. And I can't forget to mention about the colorful characters, each and everyone incredibly likable. My favorite characters are Basil (of course, he's the hero!) and Fidget (Candy Candido, who has done the voices of characters in Disney movies ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Peter Pan"", and ""Robin Hood""). And I must mention that Vincent Price doing the voice of Professor Ratigan is a must see. I have always been a fan of his, listening to some of the old radio shows (example, ""The Saint""), seeing some of movies, even watching him guest star on the old tv show ""The Man from UNCLE"". Just watching this movie for the chance to hear Vincent Price is worth it all.
And the music is also well-done by Henry Mancini and there are some fun songs:
""The World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" (Vincent Price) - A rousingly funny song, I love the part where Ratigan begins strumming his harp!
""Let Me Be Good To You"" (Melissa Manchester) - When this chorus mouse starts off this song, you're at first not sure what's going on. But after a while, I'm sure you too will begin kicking your feet up to the beat!
""Goodbye So Soon"" (Vincent Price) - Great song, can't help but sing along each time though at this point in the movie, things are looking dire for Basil and his friends.
I can certainly recommend this movie for both kids and adults. Enjoy! Here are a few interesting trivia I found:
*~*Shortly before his death, he said that one of his most favorite roles was the voice of Professor Ratigan in the Disney feature ""The Great Mouse Detective"", especially since two original songs had been written for him.
*~*Basil of Baker Street and Dr. David Q. Dawson are named after Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, who played Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson together in several films. Also, in the film, we actually see the shadow of the 'real' Sherlock Holmes, and the voice is actually done by Basil Rathbone.
*~*The clock tower scene is the first major use of computer animation (the clock's gears) in a feature-length animated film.
*~*Impressed with Alan Young's performance of a near-authentic Scottish accent for the voice of Hiram Flaversham, studio brass cast him as the voice of the Scottish-accented Scrooge McDuck in a series of Disney film and television projects. He became the official voice of the tightwad duck.
*~*During the recording of Vincent Price's lines, animators sketched his exaggerated Shakespearean gestures and worked them into the animated poses for Ratigan.",1045267200,80,4124,4.834512022630834

462419,4,6302426200,"I'd like to start off by saying that this movie is probably one of my all time favorite movies.  I didn't even stop to think about it when I saw it for sale, I bought it straight away.  I would recommend this movie to anybody;  The story is entertaining and sound, the acting is superb and the animation is top-notch (even for a movie that is nearing 20 years old).
Having said all that, I'm going to focus on the things I think could have been improved.  To start with, the first thing you see:  The cover art.  To be honest I feel the cover art is quite disappointing.  It somehow managed to miss the feeling of the movie entirely.
Secondly, the Menu system.  Compared to the menus used in movies such as Shrek, Atlantis, and Harry Potter (to name a small few) this menu is about as interesting as grass growing.  It features a series of still images with minor animation applied, such as Basil's pupils moving, or his ears (for some odd reason) growing and shrinking.
Finally, I personally didn't find the special features to be very impressive at all.  I can appreciate the lack of available material to include here, so it is a forgivable fault.  However, when every other DVD I own has well over 5 hours of content and this one has maybe one hour beyond that which is in the movie I am a little disappointed.
So, I guess my statement to other readers is ""Buy This DVD!"".  My statement to Disney is ""Pay a little more attention to the extra things please!"".",1032825600,3,1462,4.394052044609666
462420,4,6302426200,"THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE is one of the Disney animated films that is underrated and not scene or talked about it a lot. The animation and settings are superb. The music is brilliant and the characters very real - for being animated that is.
First off, Mr. Henry Mancini (Pink Panther and the Elephant Walk fame) is the films composer of note. The main theme for Basil (Our Great Mouse Detective) and the subsequent enhancements made by the `dangerous' moments in the play make this score a fantastically orchestrated one.
The story is a little unique in that Basil and his sidekick Dawson (hence Holmes and Watson like) are searching for the abducted father of our little heroin (age 8) Olivia. The plans get complicated as the bad guy; Professor Ratigan tried to take over the mouse world with one evil plan against the mouse queen. Not only is the day saved, but I think the kids will learn a lot about respect, being brave, being honest and what friendship is all about. Nice moral play in this film. You even get inside the famous Big Ben itself.
Now the supreme evil character is voiced by the one and only Vincent Price. Need I say more?
The DVD extras on this one very good as well and surprisingly entertaining. To keep in the clock themes, there are two `time' related shorts that are pretty funny and the behind the scenes documentary are very good as well. There is even a sing-a-long for the kids.

Now scroll ahead to now ten years later. At the age of 19 my opinion of this movie has not changed at all. I still absolutely love it to pieces.
This 1986 masterpiece from Disney is a story about a tough mouse detective called Basil who alongside with his sidekick battles the evil rat named Professor Ratigan(Great name too) who sends his henchman bat Fidget who ends up kidnapping Olivias Flamershams father and ultimately Olivia herself and it's up to Basil, his sidekick Dawson and a family pet dog by the name of Toby to rescue her and her father and stop Ratigan and his malevolent crime schemes before he takes over all of Englands mousedon(Mouse equivilent of kingdom).
To me The Great Mouse Detective contains incredible depth and wonderful charachters and it doesn't suffer from excessive cheesiness like some of Disneys more popular films such as Pocahontas.
In fact it's the more obscure movies like this and Robin Hood that I tend to enjoy more than lets say, The Little Mermaid(I like that movie too.
