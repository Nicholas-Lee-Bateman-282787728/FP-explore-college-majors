8727699,5,B013HN626M,"Shot in Mesa Arizona. One of Kurt Russell's (Overboard) best. And one of Jack Warden's (Death on the Nile) best. Together with the help of a great supporting cast, including Toby (real name not known), have created the exact used car lot environment. Jack Warden plays brothers that are more believable than, Lindsay Lohan. Throw in Al Lewis as Judge Harrison and approximately a mile of cars, then you have a movie. So get out the popcorn and buckle your seat belt for this smashing vehicle.",1499558400,2,492,4.732558139534884
