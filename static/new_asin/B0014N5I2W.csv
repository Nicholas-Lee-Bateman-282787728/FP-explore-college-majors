Dan Patrick thought he could just slap a movie together to show at local churches and it would bring in a few more votes.  It reminds me of the new age movies that are out there:  bad quality, in-your-face message but really not a movie -- more a sermon and just the same old stuff rehashed.",1234742400,4,362,4.142857142857143
3133905,4,B0014N5I2W,"This movie is a story about Christian faith, loss, and what race really means in America.  It tells the true story of an event that changed lives through tragedy and forgiveness.

A small Texas town home to both blacks & whites suffers a accident that crosses racial lines.  But instead of the devision and hate we get sold in the media, the Heart of Texas that knows no color stands tall.

The presentation is very good, though you can see it is not Hollywood quality.  Take the time to watch the extras on the DVD for additional blessings.

This movie made me reconsider forgiveness in my own life, and in my children's lives.  It reminded me of the sacrifice Christ made for me and my faith.  While watching, women will weep, but I smiled with joy.

An uplifting tale for the whole family.",1233273600,19,792,4.4825174825174825

My wife is from another close town, Eagle Lake Tx and she grew up going to this town. This story is touching and opened my heart to be more forgiving. It made several men cry in my class including myself. I hate to say this but I liked this movie soo much that I made 3 copies for my family to spread this great gospel.

It is also a testimony that sometimes forgiveness is so difficult, that we are not capable of it ourselves; only through Christ can it be given.

3133953,4,B0014N5I2W,"I was expecting a movie, a film.  But was surprised to find out this is a documentary type movie that is a series of interviews retelling a story.  A little girl was killed in a vehicle accident and they interview the mother, father, family, and friends from her small town in Texas to share her story, how the accident happened, and the deep forgiveness the family had for the driver that hit the 4-year old.  Definitely a tear-jerker and definitely worth seeing!  It REALLY teaches the importance and depth of true forgiveness.

3133956,1,B0014N5I2W,"An elderly black man's life is in danger of being torn apart because a middle aged mom who coddles her children pulls to the side of the road at their request and when her 4 year old daugther jumps out of the car and into the path of his car creating an unavoidable accident we ask how can HE be forgiven? No, the first question should be shouldn't he be asked to forgive the stupidity that pushed him into an almost life destroying event not of his making? Nowhere in the movie are we to question his version which was totally an accident without any negligence on his part yet he is somehow demonized by many of those in his community. Then when the father of the ""victim"" shows Chrisitian acts we are in wonder when we should not be. The 2 men were close friends and it only takes a tiny little bit of empathy (which apparently none of the other reviewers have) to see that his wife's mistake combined with the immaturity of a 4 year old have wronly interceded into this innocent man's life and restituion should be made.",1312243200,6,1024,4.338541666666667

3133961,5,B0014N5I2W,"In response to Marguerite Chipp Matthews' '1 star' review (regarding the movie, 'Heart Of Texas')... it's a sad commentary of how degenerate & vile the compassion (or rather, lack of...)of a fellow human being can deteriorate; to actually refer to the subject matter of the untimely death of a little four-year-old girl... someone's beloved daughter... as, 'just the same old stuff rehashed'...my God, it reflects the blackest sort of a soul-less heart. Of course one can smell, as w/ a lot of callous individuals these days; she doesn't exist to experience compassion for another's tragedy... she just wants to be 'entertained'. Something along the way certainly rendered you a horribly bitter person, to declare such coldness... I earnestly pray for your repentance. You will see the day, that if you don't consider your salvation more seriously, although their sweet daughter, Joy, is in Heaven with her Beloved Father God, I tremble to consider where you'll be... that being said not out of vengeance, but true remorse. Here's something to consider... does this make you angry, or do you feel the need to heed the warning implied? It may be one of the most important inquiries of your life. As for the 'in-your-face message', as you put it regarding this movie... for some it may be 'in-your-face', but for others of us, it is 'in-your-heart'... not a negative of human loss, but the shining victory that Jesus died to give us, whereby we're enabled to comprehend tragedy & suffering, & by the work of the Cross transform it into forgiveness, redemption, & the blessing of glorifying our Loving Father God Who Alone can render Goodness out of badness... He'll do as much for you if you'll just allow Him to ~ until such a time, you're in our prayers my dear one... & trust me; in the Sight of God you are very dear indeed! Godspeed ~ L.

3133967,4,B0014N5I2W,"the dvd is all touchy and stuff and you can watch it yourself, however, one thing to think about is that is the accident really the truck driver's fault?  that girl jumped into the highway herself.  Most ppl I talked to think it's definitely not the driver's fault.  so then how can one ""forgive"" someone who didn't do anything wrong?  It's like someone commited suicide by jumping down from the roof of my house without my permission, and her parents ""forgave"" me, I would say ""what the heck are you forgiving me for?  I didn't do anything wrong. you are crazy....""  but anyway, aside from disagreeing with this ""forgiveness"" I still give them credit for their good hearts....ok, you can watch the video.",1244764800,6,705,4.691056910569106

No, the first question should be shouldn't he be asked to forgive the stupidity that pushed him into an almost life destroying event not of his making? Nowhere in the movie are we to question his version which was totally an accident without any negligence on his part yet he is somehow demonized by many of those in his community. Then when the father of the ""victim"" shows Chrisitian acts we are in wonder when we should not be. The 2 men were close friends and it only takes a tiny little bit of empathy (which apparently none of the other reviewers have) to see that his wife's mistake combined with the immaturity of a 4 year old have wronly interceded into this innocent man's life and restituion should be made.",1312243200,6,1024,4.338541666666667

3368458,5,B0014N5I2W,"In response to Marguerite Chipp Matthews' '1 star' review (regarding the movie, 'Heart Of Texas')... it's a sad commentary of how degenerate & vile the compassion (or rather, lack of...)of a fellow human being can deteriorate; to actually refer to the subject matter of the untimely death of a little four-year-old girl... someone's beloved daughter... as, 'just the same old stuff rehashed'...my God, it reflects the blackest sort of a soul-less heart. Of course one can smell, as w/ a lot of callous individuals these days; she doesn't exist to experience compassion for another's tragedy... she just wants to be 'entertained'. Something along the way certainly rendered you a horribly bitter person, to declare such coldness... I earnestly pray for your repentance. You will see the day, that if you don't consider your salvation more seriously, although their sweet daughter, Joy, is in Heaven with her Beloved Father God, I tremble to consider where you'll be... that being said not out of vengeance, but true remorse. Here's something to consider... does this make you angry, or do you feel the need to heed the warning implied? It may be one of the most important inquiries of your life. As for the 'in-your-face message', as you put it regarding this movie... for some it may be 'in-your-face', but for others of us, it is 'in-your-heart'... not a negative of human loss, but the shining victory that Jesus died to give us, whereby we're enabled to comprehend tragedy & suffering, & by the work of the Cross transform it into forgiveness, redemption, & the blessing of glorifying our Loving Father God Who Alone can render Goodness out of badness... He'll do as much for you if you'll just allow Him to ~ until such a time, you're in our prayers my dear one... & trust me; in the Sight of God you are very dear indeed! Godspeed ~ L.

Most ppl I talked to think it's definitely not the driver's fault.  so then how can one ""forgive"" someone who didn't do anything wrong?  It's like someone commited suicide by jumping down from the roof of my house without my permission, and her parents ""forgave"" me, I would say ""what the heck are you forgiving me for?
