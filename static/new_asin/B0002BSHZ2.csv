8025781,2,B0002BSHZ2,"ROBO MAN is about a famous American physicist, named Martino, who returns from Russia after a severe automobile accident. Upon arrival, we see that his head, left arm, and upper body have been replaced w/ metal. He is taken to a secret facility for debriefing / interrogation. Elliot Gould plays a suspicious government agent who doesn't believe Martino's story. This movie is fairly slow. Nothing really happens for the first 50+ minutes. Then, once Martino leaves the government facility, the ""action"" begins (sort of). There's an assassination attempt, a car chase, an explosion, and the big reveal. A strange film. I found myself (almost) engrossed in it, even while nodding off!...",1360454400,2,686,5.1891891891891895
