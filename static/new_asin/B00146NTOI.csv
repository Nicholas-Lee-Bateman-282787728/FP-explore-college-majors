8254559,5,B00146NTOI,Perfect for stretching. I use it almost everyday. Fantastic variety. I love it! If you like ballet or just would like to stretch at home it is the perfect video. Very clear explanation.,1390608000,,185,4.636363636363637
8254560,5,B00146NTOI,"This is really geared specifically towards ballet dancers and really focuses on improving flexibility of the lower extremities and turnout. If you're completely new to ballet stretching exercises, I can see why someone may have some difficulty following along, but it really is quite simple.  Overall, a very effective and targeted 30 minute stretch without wasting time on unecessary ""warmup"" (stretching neck, shoulders, etc.) like you get in the more traditional workout video.  And I love the soothing classical music in the background. The sound quality isn't the greatest, but not so much so that it's bothersome.  Thanks Alexandra!!!",1306022400,6,640,5.444444444444445
8254561,3,B00146NTOI,"These are the kinds of homebrew stretches you'll meet people doing in ballet classes everywhere in the world.  Some are okay, others a mite dangerous.

I recommend instead&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stretch-Turn-out-Extension/dp/B002SSLY2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stretch, Turn-out, & Extension</a>&nbsp;as a much better and safer and, in the long run, more effective program.  It costs more but is infinitely more valuable.",1299110400,2,475,7.6
8254562,2,B00146NTOI,This dvd was hard to follow as she did not show the moves that would be done prior to the exercise and it was not always possible to look at the dvd if you were trying to do the exercise.  Sound was poor also.,1268611200,7,209,3.75
8254563,5,B00146NTOI,"I absolutely love this stretching program. It teaches you how to stretch properly and improve your flexibility quickly. The instructions are very easy to follow and they are great for any gender and age. My husband, I and our kids are using this video.",1259625600,4,252,4.75
8254564,5,B00146NTOI,"The video simple but with clear instructions. useful 30 min exercises especially for dancers.  I have been searching for a video to help improve her stretching.  This was the best video that I have found and has been very helpful in helping her. She has been doing the stretching exercises on a daily basis and improving not only her stretch but turnout.
Thanks",1236124800,8,361,4.714285714285714
