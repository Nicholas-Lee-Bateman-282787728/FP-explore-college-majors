4981295,2,B006A8XGNY,"It's always nice to see something new tossed into the mix when it comes to horror films. Well it's nice to see it when it works. When it doesn't it just becomes tedious and makes you wish something better had happened. Such is the case with STORMHOUSE.

Taking place 11 months before the invasion of Iraq it tells the story of a secret military base in England that has captured an entity, a ghost if you will. Professional ghost whisperer Hayley Sands has been brought in to assist with how to handle this entity and control it. Taken through the various stages of security she finally meets the man in charge, Maj. Lester.

Lester doesn't feel that Hayley will be able to accomplish much. Taking her to see the entity, she finds an electrified chain link fence that contains it. Watching videos of the enclosure she gets a glimpse of what it looks like when it allows itself to be seen. But seeing isn't what she needs to do. She needs to come in contact with it to understand it better.

Yeah, that's gonna have good results. Of course things go wrong, the entity escapes and begins possessing various members of the guard as well as an Iraqi citizen they tossed into its cage to see how it would react. This film features military stereotypes that are definitely not the good guys.

The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. It's low and slow, taking far too much time to unfold and when it comes time for a payoff we get to glimpse pretty much nothing. Had the entity slowly possessed one member of the team and maneuvered them around it might have been more interesting. Or had the film gone the opposite route and shown the entity more often it would have been better. Instead it leaps from one person to the next and never quite gives us time to react.

This is not to say the movie is totally without merit. There are far too many horror films released these days that offer less story and more gore. Both are represented here but not to the point of being excessive. But with the story they have so much more could have been done with it. Still, for a $1 rental this movie could offer a few chills and some thought provoking ideas that would lead to a discussion of what would the military do if it actually did employ a creature like this.",1332806400,,2259,4.420673076923077
4981296,2,B006A8XGNY,"I like the premise: military has a supernatural entity and brings in a person capable of communicating with it.  But it falls apart on almost every level.  There are spoilers following.
1. If it is so easily capable of possessing people outside of the enclosure, why is it still imprisioned?
2. Considering how it was acquired, why are they surprised it is homicidal?
3. Why do people who make this kind of movie think that shooting a film in the dark makes up for no real f/x and lousy plot?
4. They would have had to try really hard to find characters I could care about less.
5. Why bring an American psychic to a Brit military base?  England has its' own psychics.
The pacing is uneven, the plot has huge holes and the climax of the movie is both not surprising and is disappointing.",1331856000,6,787,4.413793103448276
4981297,4,B006A8XGNY,"The film opens with the phrase ""Based on a true event."" It then flashes the year ""2002"" and that the military had captured a super natural entity. (Guess which one was the true event.) I was confused as to the location. The box claims it was the US military, but everyone in it is English. The film incorporates much of the poor video feed that is used in the ""Paranormal"" series.

Hayley Sands (Katherine Flynn) is the perky civilian ghost expect used by the British police to solve crimes. She is escorted by the military down 9 floors underground. Her room is akin to a cell. The entity is held behind a a single layer of chain link fence with some barbed wire on top and a big gaping hole. The commander doubts her ability to deal with the entity and entertains her because he must. She befriends Justin (Patrick Flynn) who doesn't doubt her.

The control that the entity has over individuals intensifies as the film progresses. At one point the vile creature has a British soldier singing in French! Eventually this thing gets loose (or else the movie would be real short and boring). The film goes about 2 minutes too long. It should have ended with Basketball Jones.

The movie is a fairly decent low budget ""reality"" paranormal movie which has become the new genre in horror. Glad to see these type of films employing real actors for a change. If you liked ""The Thing"" or the ""Paranormal"" stuff, you might want to take a peek.

F-bomb, C-word, sex talk, no nudity.",1331424000,2,1472,4.543396226415094
4981298,3,B006A8XGNY,"The premise of STORMHOUSE is very similar to the last 20 minutes of THE ENTITY, a 1981 poltergeist thriller starring Barbara Hershey. In that portion of the film, a group of scientists try to capture a very nasty ghost/rapist, with variable results. STORMHOUSE extends that sequence to an entire feature-length production, likewise with variable results.

Most of the movie is low-key and creepy while the ghost is locked up. Once it escapes, the movie descends into slasher-film territory needlessly. Had it not done so, I would have tacked another star onto it.",1330905600,,563,5.119565217391305
4981299,2,B006A8XGNY,"The idea behind this movie is pretty good: What if the military could trap a supernatural entity? Of course, they'd have scientists study it. Where this film goes wrong is that there's little thought beyond that premise. Stupid characters doing stupid things describes the middle part. The ending has a nice twist, tho.",1329696000,,319,5.037735849056604
4981300,1,B006A8XGNY,"I purchased this movie as I was beginning to become familiar with Amazon streaming video.

This movie is a disaster on so many levels.  The cinematography is just awful; every scene is hard to see because it is so dark.

The dialogue is often completely unintelligible and muddy.

The plot is totally beyond rational belief, even for those of us believing in supernatural entities.

Do not waste your money on this poorly done movie with a terrible plot, almost invisible scenes, and dialogue that cannot be interpreted.",1328832000,,520,4.931034482758621
4981301,1,B006A8XGNY,"The movie stresses in the beginning that this event took place exactly 4 days before the start of the Iraq war.  I kept waiting for there to be some tie in to that fact in the movie.  There wasn't one other than the fact that this takes place at a supposedly top secret military facility.  The plot is that this group has supposedly captured a supernatural entity or ghost and is holding it in a cage surrounded by a high powered reverse electro magnetic field.
They bring in a very young and pretty inexperienced psychic to be their connection to the entity.  Her technique involves walking up to the cage and asking the ghost stupid questions like ""What period in history are you from?""  The ghost, however, seems more interested in talking to anyone but her.  The whole movie was just a lot of nonsensical cliches thrown together in a spooky, dark environment.  It doesn't make for a scary movie or even an interesting movie. Don't waste your time or money.",1328745600,,960,4.578947368421052
4981302,2,B006A8XGNY,"This movie left me profoundly sad; no so much for elements in the story but because of the tremendous waste of a fairly novel plot. With the exception of that of the main actress, all of the acting is terrible to say the least. The entire show is and feels low budget and the physical facilities hardly were adapted to accommodate the story line. As far as the plot goes, a basketball-loving killer spirit is a bit of a stretch though.",1369008000,4,435,4.382716049382716
4981303,4,B006A8XGNY,another scary movie! yes gotta say I like these kinda movies lol but yes... this was a good movie to watch. not overly scary but jut enough.,1367107200,,140,4.222222222222222
4981304,2,B006A8XGNY,"Very poor acting, I stopped watching about 10 min. into it.  Don't waste your time unless your other choice is 'watching grass grow'.",1366329600,,133,4.782608695652174
4981305,4,B006A8XGNY,"First, I was quite surprised at the low ratings.
This movie is one of the creepiest & most frightening films I've seen.
I'm not easily amused or scared.
The acting was spot on.
Chilling.
I will never hear that children's tune ""Ferra Jacques, Ferra Jacques....Ding, Dang, Dong"" in the same way again.
I've seen this film at least 3 times and it gets to me each time.
I like it when I can't see the ending coming!! There is a twist!
So, different strokes for different folks but if your looking for a good ,different & very creepy film, then take a chance!!",1365465600,,555,4.398058252427185
4981306,1,B006A8XGNY,This film was doomed from the start. Bad lighting couldn't hide the bad acting in this low budget loser. 1 star.,1363219200,,112,4.380952380952381
4981307,3,B006A8XGNY,"Hey, I liked this movie! It inspired some sci-fi ruminations, which are enjoyable when it's snowing like crazy outside! I found the premise to be original, the secret project including using political criminals as lab animals. At this point in life, I don't worry about how unlikely each detail is. For that matter, nothing which is supposed to be ""realistic"" really comes close to reproducing The Real, which is unfathomable :)
I give this movie 3 stars!",1360281600,2,455,4.922077922077922
4981308,2,B006A8XGNY,"************Spoiler Alert******************************

Although this is a horror movie, there isn't much to spoil.

I saw this on Instant Video and was ticked off to see that there were no subtitles.  Three or four of the main Antagonists (and they are just that) have accents and speech that is not comprehensible to the American ear.  The main human bad guy (can't figure out how to spell villian this morning) speaks in a mumbled English accent that is just not understandable.
Story reviews are on other reviews.  But there is a huge tip off.  The main antagonist is not attacked by the entity at all.  Makes no sense whatsoever.",1355356800,4,635,4.878504672897196
4981309,4,B006A8XGNY,"The filmmakers have an understanding of how the Government/Military actually works, and represent the story well.  I found it interesting, and it flowed well.

This is one of those films that utilizes a plot twist that further enhances the story...in the last  second of the film.

Worth seeing.",1345161600,2,295,5.083333333333333
4981310,1,B006A8XGNY,"Within the first 15 minutes of this film, I was already irritated. Most of the scenes are too dark to tell what's going on, the dialog is low at times and hard to hear, the effects are terrible, and you want to see the characters die to break the dull pacing and the fact that none of them are likeable in the least.

When the film starts, you are told that it's based on true events. I'm not a skeptic when it comes to the paranormal; but I'm having a real hard time buying the 'true story' gimmick. I give this flick a 1 star simply because that's the lowest score they will let me give it.

Save your time and money.",1342224000,,619,4.065573770491803
4981311,1,B006A8XGNY,Most of this film is shot in the dark. Very difficult to tell what is going on. Has some gore but not much of a horror film. Save your money for something else.,1336867200,,160,3.878787878787879
8495659,3,B006A8XGNY,"Worth a watch, if you're into this sort of film. Could of been better, good concept - story just not fleshed out enough. Ending worked for me.",1518825600,,142,4.296296296296297
8495660,5,B006A8XGNY,Very intriguing twist in this movie on the theme of whether or not there is a 'soul'.,1453334400,,85,4.0588235294117645
8495661,2,B006A8XGNY,"Interesting premise, lots of potential... poorly executed.

It's a bit like the more recent mockumentary/found footage horror film ""The Atticus Institute"" (imprisoned supernatural entity under the attempted control of the military), though Atticus was far more engrossing and ""believable.""

I'd actually really dig seeing a remake of this by another filmmaking team.",1429401600,,366,6.019230769230769
8495662,2,B006A8XGNY,"This supposed to be based on a true story? I can't see where it has true events, but you never know. I personally did not like this movie at all. Complete waste of time.",1409011200,,169,4.0

The only, single, one time Amazon has let me down on a purchase.  Why would I pay to watch this dog?

8495665,4,B006A8XGNY,"From other reviews, I expected this to be pretty crappy.  Aside from some laughable acting at the beginning, and a little too much gore for my taste, this was actually a fairly good movie.  Excellent plot twist at the end.",1380844800,2,222,4.525
8495666,2,B006A8XGNY,"This film made no real sense, they have ""captured"" an entity they don't tell you how or why. They call in what is supposed to be a psychic or ghost whisperer, again without telling us anything. She is not welcome by the military presence,  again without telling us anything...The acting is (sighs) well I've seen worse, however these poor actors were working with a horrible script and a small budget. The ""special effects"" are soooo lame. I can't believe I watched the whole thing, I kept hoping they would answer my questions, they didn't. Not worth the time.",1379548800,2,561,4.724489795918367
8495667,1,B006A8XGNY,"If this movie is based on any kind of a true story you sure won't be able to separate fact from fiction from this production. The story is poorly constructed as well as executed with little info on the cast of characters or the entity or for that matter how it was caught until the very end. This was not worth the headache I got trying to see what was happening in the next to zero light scenes. We are given a few fleeting glimpses of the entity and not much else and the same can be said of the fight scenes with the entity due to poor lighting and cutaway editing. This movie just seemed to be thrown together on a whim and put on the market. Was it worth the time to watch? DEFINITELY NOT -3 stars

8495668,2,B006A8XGNY,"Who knew a film about a captured supernatural entity could be so mind-numbingly boring?  Stormhouse begins dead on arrival and doesn't offer so much as a single post-mortem twitch the rest of the way.  It's like the filmmakers came up with a way to can mediocrity in cinematic form.  There's a little bit of gore, but don't expect any chills or thrills or anything resembling suspense.

So, yeah, some kind of British black operations unit has managed to capture a supernatural entity and apparently wants to turn it into some kind of weapon against terrorists or something.  Okay.  So far, though, the only thing they've been able to do is keep it contained in a cell using an electromagnetic fence.  Enter American ghost whisperer Haley (Katie Flynn), who has been sent to the underground base by some Minister or other to try and communicate with the invisible and silent prisoner.  She does seem to make some kind of connection with the thing, but the lieutenant in charge opts to take more extreme measures for getting answers.  Naturally, the entity ends up escaping and all hell breaks loose down there.

One of the many frustrating things about this movie is the fact that the whole thing is basically shot in the dark, so be prepared to turn off all the lights or risk some serious eyestrain trying to follow what is happening onscreen.  Some of the dialogue can be hard to make out, as well, which is particularly a problem if you're watching it on Amazon's ""we don't need no stinkin' closed captioning"" video service.  Really, though, there's so little story here that it doesn't really matter how much you can actually see and hear.",1372982400,,1644,4.75
