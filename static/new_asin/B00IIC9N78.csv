No, the worst film.  Full stop.  And I get that they were going for a sort of hyper-violent, hyper-sexual humor, but the humor isn't funny, the sex scenes aren't sexy, there's no suspense whatsoever, and the special effects are too pathetic to even successfully gross you out.

The Amazon editorial review mentions that ""the intro credits give the best summary of the upcoming film.""  That's undoubtedly true.  Both the opening and closing credit sequences seem to go on forever, feature terrible rock music, and display CGI that looks like it was rendered on a PlayStation One.  The editing within individual scenes is abysmal, and the English dubbing makes most Mystery Science Theater selections look like nuanced masterpieces.  The opening scene actually involves a bit of plot, as the film explains how the goblet became cursed (it involves latex, blood, a virgin sacrifice, and some shoddy swordsmanship).  But after an archaeologist discovers the artifact, there's really no rhyme nor reason to where it shows up afterward.  The scenes are connected by an occasional voiceover and the ensuing death/sex.

The film does have one saving grace: two of the scenes are so over-the-top -- absolutely ludicrous mixtures of sex and violence -- that they may very well live on as Reddit .gifs.  The first scene involves a woman who dies after performing fellatio on (what I hope is) a giant fake penis.  His orgasm fills her entire head up like a balloon; when it explodes, it simultaneously kills her and lops off his penis (killing him as well).  The second scene involves a blonde and some Nazis... well, no description I could give here could possibly do it justice.

My honest advice is to avoid this film.  If you must partake, be prepared to fast-forward through large chunks of the movie to get to the scenes that look most promising to you.  Otherwise, this is about 70 minutes of your life that you'll never get back.",1421366400,,2094,4.850704225352112
