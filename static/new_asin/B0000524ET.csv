1388781,5,B0000524ET,"This is such a sweet story about an innocent colored girl entering an all white school back in the early intergration years. Ruby Bridges will inspire you to change your opinion on racism, and make you a better person. This little girl changed the world for people of color, only she didn't know it then. She entered the world of nasty white prejudice people, and stood her ground, thanks to the love of her parents, and her faith in God. She prayed daily as she walked up the stairs into her school, for God to forgive those closed minded people who mocked her on a daily basis. She overcame her fears, and stood strong. She wanted to make friends at her school, but the white parents wouldn't allow their children to mingle with her, she prayed for them too. In the end, she opened doors for all colored children, and has become an inspiration to hundreds of people. It's a great story too, about about a doctor who thought Ruby would lose it mentally, with all the pressures from taunting words she heard daily, but come to find out, he too, was prejudice, only he didn't realize it at first. He too, overcame his hate for blacks. I recommend this movie to all, young and old alike. I had my daughter take this to her Christian school to share with her second grade class on a rainy day, and they all loved it. It's perfect for Black History week at school. If you have a movie of this, share it with your children's class too, they'll learn from it. It's a movie they'll never forget.",1062720000,17,1488,4.414545454545454
1388782,5,B0000524ET,"This little girl rocked the world and the world rocks today because of her and other ""fearless"" and ""faithful"" men and women, boys and girls who stopped at nothing to restore hope to the hearts of Americans and people worldwide.  I've watched this movie over and over again with friends, my nieces, and colleg schoolmates.
This movie is very educational and what better way to educate than to use a pretty accurate motion picture!  For those who are unaware of how hard it was for African-Americans and others who fought to bring equality to America, this is a must-see movie.  You must show your kids and friends this movie.  And for those who have personally experienced some of the hardships of being judged on race rather than character, you will celebrate the content of this movie and how hope was restored in a day when all hope seemed gone.  And for those who stood with or marched along side of the ""Rudys"" of this world you, you'll be reminded everyday of why you stood up for such a worthy cause.
The actors were great!!!",1011225600,4,1032,4.586956521739131
1388783,5,B0000524ET,"I am a 7th grader from California and my History teacher showed this video in class. I found it to be one of the best videos I have ever watched. It taught me so much and that day I went home and did more research about Ruby Bridges. A few weeks later I decided to do my History Field Day progect on her since the topic was 'New Fronties.' I also bought the movie with my own money and showed it to my brother, who was for some reason kind of prejudice, and since then he has never said one word about not liking a black person. This movie taught me so much and even my parents ask to watch it over and over again. It is heartwrenching every time I watch it and it showed my brother what hard times black people went through and that they do have feelings also. This movie is OUTSTANDING and I recommend it to anyone!",985132800,86,817,4.049382716049383
1388784,5,B0000524ET,"I found this movie to be very well done.  It shows not only what some African Americans have been through, but it is also a good lesson in believing that things will work out for the best.  The strength that Ruby  displayed is a great lesson for anyone - always hold your head high, no  matter what.  I think everyone should see this movie, and teachers should  teach it in their classrooms.",955152000,2,391,4.361111111111111

1388787,5,B0000524ET,This powerful movie is a playback on the intagrating process back in the 60's.

This is a wonderful movie  and I recomend it to all people!,949276800,,253,4.340425531914893
1388818,4,B0000524ET,"Excellent movie for young homeschooled kids (5 and 7) who just learned about the Civil Rights movement.  There are some intense scenes in which Ruby has hateful things being shouted at her by adults, but not violent.  This movie portrays the resilience of a little girl in a loving and supportive family.  Excellent message and great way to discuss issues of justice.",1517184000,2,367,4.887096774193548

Not just them but mexicans, muslims, anyone from the middle east, etc etc etc. What anger's me right now is the hate Donald Trump is inciting! Will racism ever stop?

This movie gave me a great deal of understanding and a lot to think about. What a brave girl to go trough all that. There is still segregation to this day!

1389049,5,B0000524ET,"Disney's Ruby Bridges is a great movie and I show it every year when teaching about the Civil Rights movement to third graders.  It requires preparation prior to showing, so I read biographies about Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, and Ruby Bridges first so that students understand what was happening at the time, and then show the movie.  The movie does a great job of conveying Ruby's experience as a 1st grader integrating an all white school in New Orleans in 1960.  I had the GREAT FORTUNE of having Ruby Bridges visit our suburban NJ school in 2010 - the 50 Anniversary of this historic event.  It was a valuable experience for our entire student body (2nd - 5th grades attended) and I continue to share her personal thoughts with current students.  It was a day that I will remember forever!",1453420800,15,803,4.626760563380282

1389477,5,B0000524ET,"Ruby Bridges is one of my heroes. As a 6-year-old first grade school girl, she stood up to such virulent hatred and threats of violence, simply by going to school every day. This was during the civil rights movement's beginnings. Of course, she was surrounded by federal marshals who protected her; but what child would have the strength or even the will to not succumb to such evil as she met every day in going to school?

One day Ruby stopped at the top of the stairs before entering her school and turned to face the angry mob. Her teacher later asked what she was saying to them. Ruby's answer amazes me still to this very day. She wasn't talking to the crowd; she was praying that God would forgive them for their hatred and cruelty!",1405814400,,739,4.4338235294117645

1389537,5,B0000524ET,"Its based on a TRUE story is the caption in the beginning of the film. And the story unfolds from there. It paints the perfect picture of just how CRUEL & EVIL ALOT of SOUTHERN ""WHITE PEOPLE"" were even to little black children during that time. The white people during that time in The SOUTH simply seemed to see black people as ""creatures"" dirty, filthy, nasty creatures. And it was a complete shame & disgrace! With the exception of a few ""good"" white people in this movie, white people just could not imagine their white children going to school with ""black children"" in the first place so for it to actually be happening during this time when the whole ""Brown Vs Board of Education"" had previously took place & school integration was mandated.

1. There was the ""Little Rock NINE"" story where the 9 black students were chosen to attend an all white High School in Little Rock Arkansas. These nine students needed the MILITARY to escort them to school through out the entire day from the EVIL white kids and their equally IGNORANT RACIST parents.

2. & then there was the story of little Ruby Bridges. The little black girl that had to endure the same cruel torment each & every grueling day being escorted to school also by security. White people took their kids out of school (kids missed ALOT of school), because they didn't want their white children in the same class as a little black girl. The little black girl wouldnt eat her lunch (shed hide the lunch in the class room & pour the juice in the glue bottle) because shed hear the white people say they were going to ""poison her""? How EVIL was that? REDICULOUS!

Just imagine if you will being the mother or father of this sweet black little girl, having to go to this school each day & face this ANGRY mob of BIGOT white folks, who called her the most HATEFUL names, spit at her, one woman had a black doll with a rope around its neck held out as she walked by. Another day a white woman had a little black doll in a coffin. I mean My GOD! Black (african Americans) have come a very long way. The black people people who have came before us were very STRONG individuals, that literally placed their lives on the line & some have died, got beaten, water hosed down in the street like dogs, they were spit on. Just disrespected like animals. Not even animals deserve such horrific forms of cruelty. But they endured so much just for us to be able to sit where we want on a city bus (public transportation), drink from any water fountain we please. To use the same ""nice-clean"" rest rooms, as those mean evil white people.

Every February (especially--since its black history month) I show my collection of Black History DVDs to my 11 year old daughter (since she was 8 years old) so that she can see & know the struggles black people had to face in their history. This way she can see why Barack Obama becoming the 44th president of the US was such an emotional moment for african Americans. She can understand also why Barack Obama becoming president is HISTORICAL. She saw the importance & POWER in VOTING is so important for black people today...my daughter knew of the 3 young men (1 black & 2 whites) who lost their lives in Mississipi fighting for black people to become first class citizens (Registered Voters), because of the DVD documenteries that we watched in previous years.

These types of Documentaries, stories, & films, should be watched in the schools all over America. Black History is just as important as any other ""History"" if not more important. But since it paints such an UGLY face on the SOUTHERN White people of that time...with the KKK being heavily involved as well with the beatings, murders & lynchings of black & white people involved in the Civil Rights movement during that time. Alot of the young Generation doesnt know about Black History & what took place during that horrible & tragic time. Schools don't put enough FOCUS during February or any time of the school year on the History of Black people. & with our President being African American & really think its ashame. Sure its an UGLY History especially for the white people, but its the UGLY TRUTH that dates back to SLAVERY in America.

AMERICA has a SERIOUSLY UGLY past, & it involves black people, & some good white people as well. More people should know about. If the schools are not teaching your kids this in History Class buy the DVDs and teach them on your own.",1266019200,,4421,4.540777917189461

1389541,5,B0000524ET,"A very good family movie based on the true story of Ruby Bridges.  Considering Disney produced this movie, it is pleasantly surprising that Disney included the Christian faith tones of Ruby Bridges family and friends throughout the movie.",1246320000,2,238,5.2631578947368425
1389542,5,B0000524ET,This is an excellent movie to show as a part of a Civil Rights unit in high school US History classes.  My colleagues and I highly recommend it.  It really gets students thinking and interested in what was happening in the US during this turbulent time period.,1244332800,,260,4.51063829787234
1389543,5,B0000524ET,"This was a terrific movie, very tastefully done. This is such an inspiring story, that beautifully demonstrates the power of the human spirit through the life of a 6 year old!  Racism cuts so deep, yet, love and faith can cause us to prevail - that's what this movie teaches.",1239840000,,275,4.5
1389544,4,B0000524ET,I am a sixth grade teacher and this video goes great with the course of study. I used in when talking about the Civil Rights Movement this year and plan to use it again next year!,1239062400,,179,4.0
1389545,4,B0000524ET,"This is really great to educate people on the struggles of integrating schools.  It was a little too focused on the religious aspect to show the whole movie in a classroom setting though.  Other than that, I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone.",1237334400,,254,4.75
1389546,1,B0000524ET,"After viewing this movie in class my fifth grader came home with a very confusing view about his inter-racial parents. If this movie is to be shown in a classroom I feel that the teacher and school should seek the consent of all parents before showing it. I didn't have that opportunity. Although it might have been a learning lesson for some, it was not a good experience for my child.",1234483200,2,386,4.450704225352113
1389547,4,B0000524ET,"This movie did what is called, ""tell the truth"", but in good taste. Why do I say that? Well it showed how people really can be, but ugly does not have to prevail. Good is a universal description.",1226793600,,195,4.157894736842105
1389548,5,B0000524ET,"An excellent true story of the first black child in an all white school in New Orleans in 1960.
  The faith this young six year old student had and the compassion she showed towards those who hated her is inspirational beyond belief.  A must see for everyone, especially good for families. I bought two copies, one for my family and one for our high school.",1224460800,,357,4.461538461538462
1389549,5,B0000524ET,Ruby Bridges was only 6-years-old when she breached southern prejudice in Louisiana. Her courage and dependence on God is an inspiration to anyone facing religious or racial prejudice.,1219622400,,184,5.607142857142857
1389550,5,B0000524ET,"I show this video to my high school freshman when we work on our To Kill a Mockingbird unit.  They love it and it truly shows how difficult desegregation was for the US.

I am so glad I found this video!",1210204800,,203,3.926829268292683
1389551,4,B0000524ET,"A good movie to understand the atmosphere in the south in the 1960s.  I'd recommend you read the book, or read about Ruby's life, first. Like most Disney movies, Ruby Bridges wraps up with a nice, don't-they-all-get-along kind of ending.  In reality, it was 2 years before Ruby played with any kids at the school, and her teacher was fired at the end of the year.

Also pleasing - the family's faith is portrayed accurately, and the power of Ruby's constant prayer is not edited out.

A great film for our family.  Recommended!",1203811200,7,527,4.623655913978495
1389552,5,B0000524ET,"I've been teaching for ten years and use Ruby Bridges each year when discussing racial integration and prejudice.  I've finally purchased my own copy.  This is a moving film that really reaches children and adults alike.  Be aware that the ""N"" word is used on two occasions and the angry mob outside of Ruby's school says terrible things to her.  One woman suggests she will poison Ruby and later shows Ruby a small coffin.  While that sounds harsh, it is an appropriate movie for 4th grade and up (with guidance).  This movie accurately shows the reprecussions for everyone involved in this act of bravery.  I would highly recommend it for your home or classroom.",1182902400,6,664,4.771929824561403
1389553,5,B0000524ET,This is an excellent video for sharing history with young children.  It is a great teaching tool that can lead to reading about other historical events that involve the lives of young children.,1182816000,,193,4.848484848484849

This brave little girl has a greater faith and more forgiving spirit than can be imagined. She is an example of how God's loves works. This is a movie that I will watch at least 2 or 3 times a year to remind me that no matter the circumstances are, faith and love can overcome anything!",1142899200,17,374,4.28169014084507

1389557,5,B0000524ET,"This movie is an important movie for anyone to watch.  It shows what it was like to be Ruby Bridges, the first black student to be desegregated.  She had to endure tortures that an adult would not want to go through.  It also shows the struggles the family had to go through as well.  If you haven't seen it, I recommend you watch it.",1104969600,23,334,4.171875
1389558,5,B0000524ET,"Have your students read Ruby's book and then show this film.  It illustrates not only the stuggle of integration in personal terms, but other topics related to history and government as well.  The supremacy of federal over state laws, the political and social climate of the times.  My students had trouble believing this story really happened the way it did, that is untill they pulled up the actual photos on the internet.  I cannot recomend this one highly enough.",1083715200,70,467,4.8734177215189876
