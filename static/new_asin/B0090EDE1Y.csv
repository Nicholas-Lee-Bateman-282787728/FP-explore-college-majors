5200499,3,B0090EDE1Y,"The thing that I like the most about Seagal movies is first, he knows the martial arts moves that he does and second, he always includes the martial arts warrior code of behavior so no matter how good or how bad the development of the story is I will watch the movie.  This movie was a straight line story that does not get complicated.  Character development is kept to a minimum and action is kept to a maximum.  If you want a good dose of martial arts action and shoot 'em up pyrotechnics then you will want to see this movie.  The storyline is that a female deep cover courier becomes expendable due to the information that she is carrying.  A certain group of the CIA decide that they want to break off from the CIA and capture her to get the information so they can set themselves up well.  Seagal and Austin are the men who do not know what is going on.  The only thing they initially know is that the girl is to be kept under strict isolation.  Well there is the setup and from here the explosions fly and the Aikido joint locks come unhinged.  Bon Apetit my action loving friends!",1352160000,4,1089,4.273170731707317
5200500,3,B0090EDE1Y,"I had even expectations for this film. On one hand, this was not only one of the rare filmic team-ups between Steven Seagal and a fellow action hero of similar caliber, but it was also the longest time the former had taken to make a movie in almost ten years - something I hoped was the result of more effort being made in the production. On the other hand, it was directed by Keoni Waxman, the filmmaker who's now officially worked with Steven Seagal more times than any other but whose vehicles are among my least favorite of Seagal's filmography. Then again, I liked Waxman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/outing-with-Steve-Austin/dp/B003Z94WBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">outing with Steve Austin</a>&nbsp;well enough, so I considered that perhaps ""Maximum Conviction"" here could achieve some kind of acceptable balance. I was right: the movie is acceptable, but far from great. It doesn't make all it could have of the collaboration between Seagal and Austin, but is still an okay-enough DTV action outing.

The story: two private security contractors (Seagal and Austin) are caught up in a deadly situation when the two prisoners they had delivered to a secret prison are targeted by a lethal team of mercenaries led by an ex-CIA mastermind (Michael Pare,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Streets-of-Fire/dp/0783227876/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Streets of Fire</a>).

It needs to be said: however good they may look on paper, Steven Seagal and Steve Austin do not make very exciting partners. Of course, one factor is the limited screentime they share, but even when they're both in the same scene, they seem relatively apathetic to eachother and don't display any discernible chemistry. On their own, they do alright, with Austin as definitely the more charismatic of the two but Seagal getting more fight scenes. They have equal amounts of screentime. The co-stars do fine but are sort of wasted: B-movie staple performer Michael Pare clomps his way through a boring role, and even though Steph Song (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dim-Sum-Funeral/dp/B00264U0O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dim Sum Funeral</a>) - one of the aforementioned prisoners - has a good deal of award nominations to her name, she's given no strong acting scenes and her role could've been played by most anybody. Yes, the script by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Justice/dp/B007Q91FN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Justice</a>-regular Richard Beattie is pretty passive, highlighted only by a couple particularly mean-spirited deaths and the occasional funny line by Austin (""Which one of you [jerks] killed my future ex-wife?"").

The action is predominantly composed of shootouts, but there's nothing special to these. Seagal's stunt doubles are hidden relatively well, but at the expense of the editing, which is once again pretty choppy during his fight scenes - not as much as it has been in the past, but it's still pretty annoying. With that said, Seagal still gets the occasional cool move in, and the final brawl - though painfully one-sided - is fun to watch in a guilty way. Steve Austin only has one real fight, but prior to this he gets entertainingly innovative in the prison kitchen, turning a gas tank into a missile and attacking a mercenary with a pot of boiling water. The best fight in the movie doesn't belong to either of them, though: martial artist Bren Foster (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Science/dp/B001I2EQW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Science</a>), despite being stifled by the same editing present in Seagal's fights, brings an energy to his single brawl that the other encounters were sorely lacking. Overall, I deem the action content on the low side of passable.

That also counts as my synopsis for the movie in general. Amateurish post-production inserts can be found here and there but are otherwise restrained, and Steven Seagal is doing his own voiceovers again, but these plus points are deflated a bit by the lackluster story and ho-hum pacing of the film. While it's a good deal better than the previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-to-Raise-Hell/dp/B004MLEYUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born to Raise Hell</a>&nbsp;and therefore a general step up for Seagal (I'm not as well-versed in Austin's output, so I can't speak for him), it's not nearly all I was hoping for during the year-and-a-half spent waiting for it. Consider it a rental.",1352160000,10,4639,5.909090909090909
5200501,2,B0090EDE1Y,"""If you listen to me and do what I say I'll kill them before they kill you."" Former black-ops agents Tom Steele (Segal) and Manning (Austin) are assigned to decommission an old prison, as well as deal with the arrival of two new female prisoners. When a team of mercinaries decides to crash the party and the identities of the women come out it becomes much bigger of a job then expected. This is pretty much what you would expect from a movie like this. Steven Segal and Steve Austin in the same movie. There is a lot of action, but Segal is a little older now so the fighting scenes aren't as exciting as they could be, but the gun fighting scenes are still worth watching. Steve Austin is pretty decent but he isn't in this as much as Segal is (in case your wondering). To be fair this isn't really my kind of movie. I know a ton of people will be all over this but I just have never really been a fan of Steven Segal so read this review with that in your head. I will admit this is one of his better movies though. Overall, if you are a fan of Segal and Austin this you will love this movie. I am not. I give it a C-.",1351814400,4,1121,4.031390134529148
5200502,3,B0090EDE1Y,"Cross (Steven Seagal) is an operational genius. His partner Manning (Steve Austin) is a weapons expert. They are ex-special forces who work as black ops contractors. Their current job is to decommission a black ops prison, one that doesn't officially exist and is located in Oregon (seriously?). For some reason our ""operational genius"" decides to shut down the prison while it still has prisoners in it.

During this period there are men dressed as Federal Marshals attempting a ""high risk extraction"" of two female prisoners to prevent them from going to a civilian prison. The film consists of Seagal/Austin and crew fighting in a prison maze against the bad guys. Seagal doesn't know if the women are in league with the bad guys or if the bad guys want them dead. It isn't hard for us to figure it out from their faces which show expressions. (Take note Steven, it's called acting!)

Early in the film Steven Seagal laughs, something I don't recall him doing in another movie. It made me laugh to watch it.

The plot is simple as most Seagal productions. There is plenty of killing, fighting, and blood. The picture appears to have been written more with Seagal in mind than Austin. I had expected more. Austin has done better films, and with Seagal it is hard to tell. This could have been one of his better productions. They need to write a part for Danny Trejo and make him the perennial bad guy. I smell sequel.

5200586,5,B0090EDE1Y,I love the movie and the choice of characters for the parts.  It was action packed and full of suspense.,1368835200,,104,4.2
5200587,3,B0090EDE1Y,"Featuring Steven Seagal and Steve Austin, Maximum Conviction (2012) delivers enough excitement and thrills to satisfy the casual action fan, however this ""collaboration"" of action stars, falls somewhat short of what it could have been, as the two men actually have very few scenes together.  In addition, Austin was recovering from a shoulder injury, which apparently put some limitations on his capabilities.

Cross (Seagal), and his friend Manning (Austin), are couple of ex-special forces types, leading a group that has been hired to decommission a federal prison facility.  Two female prisoners unexpectedly arrive, and one of them, becomes the target of a group of mercenaries led by Blake (Michael Pare), who infiltrate and take over the prison.  The bulk of the movie is an extended hunt and chase, through a prison complex that seems much larger than it actually is.  There are any number of fights and encounters, but little progress is made by anyone, in achieving their primary goal.

There is a lot to take in, as the action divided between various characters spread out throughout the prison.  Cross and Manning are the primary focus, but there is strong support from secondary characters, and the prisoners Charlotte (Aliyah O'Brien) and Samantha (Steph Song) also get involved.  Intended to be flashy, the fights and gunbattles are executed fairly well by director Waxman.

Initially engaged in the repair of a garbage truck, things don't start very well for Austin's character.  Some of his fights are more comic than combative, as more than once Manning scurries away, and passes up the opportunity to arm himself.  Operating mostly on his own, Cross attempts to lead the women prisoners to safety, but he soon becomes separated from them.  After wandering extensively through the prison, the combatants all finally come together, for a decisive showdown.

The Bluray features an entertaining commentary by director Keoni Waxman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hunt-to-Kill/dp/B003Z94WBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hunt to Kill</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Keeper/dp/B002G1WPIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Keeper</a>, True Justice) and co-executive producer Binh Dang, which provides some keen insights into what Waxman characterizes as a ""small movie"", where he was forced to change shooting locations.  The establishing shots of a prison enclosed by a high perimeter wall, do not match up at all, with the facility that appears in the film.  Interestingly, parts of the movie were shot with a Canon 5D DSLR.

Like a fishing net, the plot has a lot of holes, but there's still enough substance to take you along for a fairly fun ride, if you don't concern yourself with logic.  Austin and Seagal seem to have good chemistry, but unfortunately spend little time together.  Waxman, who has previous experience working with both men, puts the pieces together

Maximum Conviction isn't a classic in the genre, but with the two Steve's aboard, it does deliver action, suspense, and a few laughs, which may be sufficient to satisfy fans of either action star.  The Bluray/DVD is often less expensive than the DVD, if that is the case, then getting the high def combo would seem to be the way to go.",1367971200,3,3302,5.47534516765286

5200590,3,B0090EDE1Y,"Cross (Steven Seagal) & Manning (Steve Austin) are former special forces agents who are assigned to close down a secret high security prison still filled with hostile prisoners while at the same time taking in two new female prisoners for the night named Samantha Mendez (Steph Song) & Charlotte Walker (Aliyah O'Brien) who have a mysterious past.  When Cross goes to spends some time with other members of his team at the bar, Manning runs into Max (Teach Grant) who's having some issues with the trash compressor causing them to be delayed overnight while a Marshall Prisoner Transfer Unit lead by Chris Blake (Michael Pare) arrives to take the women only to no avail causing them to become hostile & take Warden Samuels (Ian Robinson) while also invading throughout the prison revealing themselves to be actually mercenaries who want the girls by any means necessary before Cross returns to not only see everything going on causing him to go retrieve the girls, who he doesn't know if he can trust, but also see that the hostile inmates have also been released.

This was the movie you would expect from these two names with their reputation in that it had all sorts of action from fist fighting to heavy gun play (the DVD cover alone shows that) with everyone playing their part well with Austin still doing his ""dry humor"" from time to time to keep it entertaining as well so it's definitely worth checking out if you want pretty much just an old school action movie.",1366675200,,1472,4.74609375

Steven Seagal is so practiced at beating up bad guys I don't think he bleeds at all. It's action with special ops backup who are a step ahead and don't make a habit of making wrong moves. Of course for the bad guys it's all about money, which they lose out on, Steven winds up with, shares with his partner and the good-guy female prisoner after all she's been through.

Austin, on the other hand, shows a lot of guts and stamina, something Seagal lacks sadly in his later movies. If you're a Seagal fan and plan on buying the movie for this reason, don't bother.

5200612,3,B0090EDE1Y,"If you are a Seagal fan, especially his Direct-to-Video efforts over the last decade or so, you shouldn't be too disappointed with this one. Considering how bad some of his recent efforts were, this one stands out as being much improved. There is some noticeable stunt double work and the usual mumbling and fake southern accent, but overall the action scenes are pretty well done for a B-movie. This one is about on par with Born to Raise Hell I think in terms of action and fight sequences though the storyline in this one is perhaps a bit more simple and since it all takes place inside of a prison you don't have any great cinematic scenes or car chases to speak of. I generally am not a fan of prison movies on virtually any level and I absolutely hated Half Past Dead, but this one I thought was done pretty well as most of the ""bad guys"" aren't prisoners but mercenaries. There are some decent shoot-out & fight scenes but nothing overly impressive about them. And as with the usual Seagal film you get some eye candy in the film, but no nudes this time (damn!?). Steve Austin was an interesting addition - he kind of reminds me of Larry The Cable Guy, but with muscles and a shinier head. He has a couple of predictable ""funny lines"" that has Junior High students laughing hysterically, but only produced a mild smirk from me. The ending leads you to believe that there might be a sequel of some sort with Seagal and Austin again. They both have name recognition, but unfortunately no real chemistry as partners as far as I could see. But Seagal's been paired with worse partners in the past (hashtag *Ja Rule*/*roundhouse to the face.*)

I probably have most of his movies and like a lot of his fans, we keep waiting for the great one to have a five star movie....oh well.",1358121600,,397,4.012658227848101

Most of the movie takes place inside of a prison where the most wicked of inmates has been set free. The fight scenes are great. The special effects are excellent. Seagal and Austin get about equal time in front of the camera. And Seagal saves the day at the end of the movie in glorious fashion.

5200637,1,B0090EDE1Y,"Words can not begin to express the feelings I have for this poorly made direct to DVD movie. With the exception of some decent photography involved there is little to like about it. Its movies like these that give direct to DVD movies a bad name and that's saying a lot.

The plot is simple and ridiculous. A secret maximum security prison is being closed down. In charge of seeing to it that things run smooth is an ex-Black Ops operative named Tom Steel (Steven Seagal). His right hand man is Manning (Steve Austin). The two banter back and forth every now and then sounding like they're reading the lines for the first time with no emotion whatsoever.

The night before closing two special prisoners were admitted under Steel's orders. One is a woman who claims she works for the CIA and has special information she needs to pass on. Of course her request is ignored by the prison warden. The transport for the prisoners arrives and things just don't seem quite kosher. Surprise! The group is actually a mercenary group sent in to capture this CIA agent and retrieve information from her. To do this they not only pose as the transport but a squad also sneaks in via the garbage truck. Oh how clever, the truck is called Trojan waste control. Get it? Like a Trojan horse? With men inside? That's the high end of wit in this movie.

When the warden is taken prisoner and the guards are being gunned down left and right only Austin can help keep the prisoners safe. Of course Seagal is on his way as well and has no problem getting into the building or calling on back up from the rest of his crew. Carnage follows in the forms of hand to hand combat and numerous gun battles and explosives toss in now and then.

I guess what truly disappoints me about this movie is that at one time I thought Seagal would be the best action star there could be. His early movies still hold a place on my shelf where I pull them out from time to time to watch. But something happened and suddenly his movies began to really stink. My only guess is that the fame went to his head and suddenly he thought he could do no wrong, taking control of most aspects of his films. Please Steven, let the guys who know what they are doing take control.

In the extras there is a part where Seagal says that he is the master of improv when it comes to movies and he inserts his own dialogue in the way that HE thinks the character would speak. I just don't imagine a high level black ops operative saying hey man every few sentences. Bill and Ted? Yes. Black ops operative? No. There is a reason the people who write scripts are paid to, well, write scripts. He should allow them to do so.

Austin doesn't fare much better. His role is nothing more than being a hard ass and kicking butt. He does that part well. It's amazing the things that happen to him that rarely cause him more than discomfort and a few minutes of unconsciousness only to rise up tougher than before in a few minutes. On occasion they give him some Schwarzenegger style one liners to say but his acting ability isn't enough that he can pull it off. I've seen some Austin films that I enjoyed as well but this isn't one of them.

One would think that two top notch action stars could make a good movie. But with the choices both have made in the past few years perhaps calling them top notch is stretching it a bit. Both have potential though I'm beginning to think Seagal's time has come and gone. Perhaps it's time to pass the torch on to someone else before he gets burned.",1352764800,2,3520,4.348554033485541

review)...liked it.

Genre: 6 Movie: 4.5

Take a look at ""The Lowedown"" on Facebook

What's it about?
When former black ops operative Cross (Seagal) and his partner
Manning (Austin) are assigned to decommission an old prison, they
must oversee the arrival of two mysterious female prisoners.

What did I think?
This movie was like a diesel engine...it took a while to warm up,
but then it ran pretty well.  I fell asleep with all the dialogue in
the beginning...it was like neither of them could talk very well.
Once the action started, it got pretty good.  With those two in an
action movie...the last thing you want is character development.",1352678400,2,702,4.857142857142857

5200640,2,B0090EDE1Y,"Steve, please don't do it! Don't go back to 2006. That was the worst and darkest days for Seagal fans. Since then, Seagal has been trending upwards....until now. The action in Maximum Conviction is too brief and doesn't carry the intensity of, say, Above the Law. I could not help but feel that 75% of the movie was just men sneaking around a poor excuse for a black ops prison playing hide and seek. When members of the two opposing groups meet, yeah, there is some quick action. Still, too many stand in shots for the aging Seagal. The acting was drab. Seagal and Austin seemed pensive and unsure of the lines. I felt sick for Steve again. Like I did in 2006. Firearm sequences were pitiful as full grown, ostensibly ultra-trained men fire automatic weapons at each other from a few feet away and miss. The reality of Seagal combat, armed and unarmed, has left the building again. Listen, I am a staunch Seagal fan. My Sicilian ancestry makes me a blood-brother to my favorite action star. I ain't trippin' -I hate to see my brother slippin'!",1352419200,,1044,4.558510638297872
5200641,3,B0090EDE1Y,"I was always a huge Seagal fan.  I have all his older stuff and some of the newer.  I stopped buying his movies when I was embarrased for him to be watching them.  He's old.  He's out of shape.  He just needs to stop.

The only reason I bought this was Steve Austin.  He's fantastic and I had high hopes he would inspire Seagal to rise to the challenge of acting with him.  It didn't happen.  There was plenty of action in the movie which is why I gave it an ""OK"" rating.

Austin looked good, what little we got to see of him.

Seagal and Pare did not.  Both look like they are dyeing their hair.  It's dead looking.  While Pare is in better physical shape than Seagal, he kind of did the role sleepwalking and that's a shame.  Seagal has finally dumped that duster coat he always wore in an attempt to hide his bulk and he has slimmed down a little, but he needs to take a lesson from the Expendables stars who are in as good as, if not better, shape than when they were in their prime.

For some reason, at the end of the film when Seagal was talking to Austin, he affected this very weird mixed up kind of ""street"" dialect and accent that you didn't hear (thank heavens!) during the rest of the movie.  Don't know what that was about unless it was his failed attempt to show he was still cool and tough.

Please, Mr. Seagal, either retire or improve.  It's sad to watch you now.

Mr. Austin, good job, keep it up, and I'll look forward to your next.",1352419200,2,1452,4.136200716845878
