8468595,4,B005ELVCWU,"History gives its audience a nice overview of some famous journeys, explorations, and discoveries from the time of the Vikings in the late 8th century to the contemporary exploration of Antarctica.  Great explorers such as Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan, Henry Hudson, David Livingston, and Roald Amundsen come back to life through a well-paced narrative, superb photography, expert comments, appropriate computer animation, and, last but not least, well-done reenactments.  In summary, this DVD set will fall in the good graces of any history buff eager to know ever more about humanity's past.",1324944000,8,617,5.623655913978495
