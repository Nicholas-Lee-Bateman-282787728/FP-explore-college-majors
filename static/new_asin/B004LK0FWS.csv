8434452,3,B004LK0FWS,"The story is old. The treatment older. The tale of the innocent Indian girl who is packaged off to phoren grooms, pigging it out in downtown London or New York, doesn't really have anything new to offer, now that there have been umpteen films on the NRI dream turned sour. So you hope A Distant Mirage might have a fresh treatment to draw your attention to the issue all over again. But all you experience is a sense of deja vu.

Sadly, there isn't enough -- neither story, nor performances -- to sustain a decent run for A Distant Mirage. But worth watching for the beautiful cinematography and a few new actors.",1300665600,,613,4.473214285714286
