4255472,5,B0043E8YAM,"While I have seen parts of this included in other documentaries, there were still bits I had not seen. If you are a true fan of the Bee Gees you will want to add this to your collection. As always, parts about Andy and Mo's passing always bring a tear.  I also enjoyed very much the bit with Celine Dion in the studio recording ""Immortality"", a song so beautiful it really does make you reach for a box of tissues.  The Bee Gees have and always will be one of the very most phenominal groups in all of music history.  Sad thing is that often times, talent such as this is not appreciated until they are gone.  I have always been a fan and will continue to be until the end of time.  Bee Gees Forever!",1292198400,4,700,4.117647058823529
4255473,5,B0043E8YAM,"I loved every minute of this Blu-ray DVD. I love everything about the Bee Gees. Was sad watching the interviews with Maurice.
I hope that Barry and Robin will sing together again.",1290816000,2,179,4.625
4255474,3,B0043E8YAM,"Good blu ray, but too much of a documentary. It should have included at least part of a complete concert, not just bits and pieces!",1290556800,,131,4.28
4255475,4,B0043E8YAM,"It is very difficult to gauge this latest release of Bee Gees history.  Probably 2/3 or more has been seen or heard before.  All the clips of the late Maurice Gibb are deftly placed at the appropriate spots, and Barry and Robin have plenty of space to share their feelings.  The DVD begins with a good amount of history of the early years in Australia and how they became famous in England.  The DVD is full of new and old musical clips from shows and concerts that add resonance and feeling to the progress of this renowned group of brothers.  However, it seems less than complete.

More than most of the concert footage, whether new or old is fuzzy or out-of-focus.  Even the more recent concerts (in the last fifteen years) seem old.  Maurice's clips are fair quality while Barry and Robin are crystal clear.  The time difference is obvious.  The story-line of First Fame in the sixties to the doldrums of the early seventies is portrayed.  The excess and success of the later seventies is also fairly discussed in equal time, but nothing is truly new.  The eighties are glossed over with very little of the brothers individuals works being mentioned other than what they produced for other artists.  There is some new and fascinating stories about `You Win Again"" from Maurice and the nineties being a new period, accompanied by some new rare clips on television concert appearances.  Still, something is missing.  The sound mixing can be chosen in DTS Digital Surround Sound, Dolby Surround 5.1 or Dolby Stereo.  However, the two surround choices are uneven.  Some clips are clearer than others while many are dulled or inadequate for true surround experience.  In most cases the only difference is the lack of vocals in the rear speakers, even with the concert clips.

The other DVD's covering their history, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Where-I-Came-In-The-Official-Story-of-the-Bee-Gees/dp/B00005KJ0V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Where I Came In - The Official Story of the Bee Gees</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bee-Gees-One-Night-Only-The-Official-Story/dp/B0000EMYC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bee Gees - One Night Only / The Official Story</a>&nbsp;are almost better in quality and excitement with many artist contributing their opinions and inspirational learning's.  The only true new information is when the modern Barry and Robin appear to discuss their family's history.  This is one of the first times that one gets a real sense of acceptance and personal growth.  The discussion of Andy's passing is heartfelt and the loss of Maurice is heartbreaking.  Closing the show, Barry and Robin join for a closed session of, ""To Love Somebody"" and ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart"", two of the most appropriates songs for this show.  The final conversation between Barry and Robin is a real eye-opener.  Robin unabashedly praises Barry for his achievements and expresses his honor in being his brother.  Barry responds as a real gentleman.  The viewer gets the feeling that maybe, finally something new will happen.  But then again, this show seems like another chapter not yet quite finished.  It satisfies the viewer and makes one wonder, what can possibly be next?",1290211200,31,3304,5.461538461538462

There are so many Bee Gees DVDs and CDs to get before this...the greatest hits with bonus DVD of all  the clips and on and on. The ONLY thing this has in my Bee Gee loving opinion is the recent clips of Barry and Robin , although at this point Blu Ray does neither of them any favors nor do the production values.

As a lifelong fan I'm always glad for more but boy were my expectations crushed upon viewing...this is nowhere near the great documentary that has already been done and the clips shown are not just poor quality but constantly interrupted so there is another frustration.",1290038400,107,2129,6.5053003533568905

4255478,5,B0043E8YAM,"""In Our Own Time"" is the latest in a series of documentaries chronicling the career of the Gibb brothers. So much has been written about The Bee Gees over the years, yet this film shows the group through the eyes of its remaining members, Barry and Robin. It covers every stage of their careers from their international breakthrough in 1967, through the disco era and up to the death of Maurice in 2003, which heralded the end of The Bee Gees. Other highlights include a section devoted to younger brother Andy, the songwriting success with other artists and Barry & Robin performing in the present. The film ends with Barry & Robin's admiration for each and a vow to continue working together which may signal a project together.

Many clips of The Bee Gees performances are shown from live TV shows, promotional films & videos and live in concert, though some of the video quality of the promos such as ""Jive Talkin"" and ""Night Fever"" is rather fuzzy as if the transfers were done from third generation videotape. The film is 2 hours long and covers 50 years of music, yet many things were not mentioned such as their unreleased album from 1973 or songs such as ""Emotion"" or ""Grease"" which were part of the Gibb dominance of the charts in 1978. The Bee Gees greatest period of '77 through '79 was touched on, but in a way that doesn't dwell on the whole era, which is a period that is most associated with the group. The ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band/dp/B00009APB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt.

A clip was shown of the Bee Gees singing ""Living Eyes"" , the title track from their 1981 album ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-Eyes/dp/B00004THIL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living Eyes</a>"", though the album is never mentioned nor are any solo performances from the '80s, other than a brief mention of Robin's 1982 album ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-Old-Are-You/dp/B000006YYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How Old Are You</a>"".

4255495,5,B0043E8YAM,"The Bee Gees were mistaken for the Beatles in the late 60s by many listeners.  I was lucky enough to be one of those people back in the 60s to mistake this awesome trio for the other awesome foursome.  Been a BIG fan of these fine musicians since ""Horizontal"" (ATCO - containing probably the best Bee Gees single ""Massachusetts"") although they have been singing and writing music since the 1950's.  I found that there are really 2 sets of Bee Gee fans.  Those who loved their ballads and those who loved their disco.  I was the former.  The DVD shows their process for song writing and as much as I like to hear about their personal lives I much prefer to understand the former.  IMO they are the most talented songwriters to ever put pen to paper.  Their ability to write music for a myriad of performers is legendary.  It is interesting to finally figure out who wrote what songs on their early albums.  To my surprise Robin wrote a lot of the hits including ""Got to get a Message to You"", ""Lamplight"", ""I started a Joke"" and my personal favorite ""Massachusetts"".  However that doesn't even scratch the surface of their body of work.",1496966400,,1135,4.514705882352941
4255496,5,B0043E8YAM,"As I watched ""In Our Own Time"" I originally thought that, if you were going to own only one dvd about the Bee Gees' life story, it would be better to buy ""This Is Where I Came In,"" issued in 2001.  I've changed my mind: you should own both.  The latter, shown in abbreviated form on A&E TV's former ""Biography"" series in 2000, delves deeper into their childhood and their familial relationships.

""In Our Own Time,"" however, gives a bit more insight into the art and process of their songwriting, and acknowledges the somewhat ""other-worldly"" quality of their inspired collaboration.  A major omission  is the fact that none of them could read or write music nor ever had music lessons of any kind.  That's an important part of their incredible story and wouldn't have been too difficult to include.

Even though there is overlap of both facts and music between the two biographies, I ended up feeling as though they are good companion pieces.  If I could, I would give ""In Our Own Time"" 4.5 stars because of the slightly diminished visual quality, but if you are attached to the Bee Gees, you won't mind.",1494806400,8,1105,4.630769230769231

4255502,4,B0043E8YAM,"I have been a fan of the Bee Gees since 1967. As a singer in a band about that time I sang a version of To Love Somebody and convinced them to do several other Bee Gees' songs. We did a decent medley combining the Beatles' Taxman with the Bee Gees' In My Own Time. However, I followed the Bee Gees' career through the several decades since, including their producing and background singing for several other artists. I have nearly every album they did, including the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band soundtrack. I also have the Barry Gibb solo albums and a few of Robin's solo albums. I think they were one of the best music acts ever. This film is a nice addition to my collection.",1484784000,2,687,4.375

4255505,5,B0043E8YAM,ive been reading some reviews here which having a negative slant bout picture quality and so on. While theres truth in that i feel they are missing the point. That being the story is being by the Bee Gees themselves and not by everyone who has spent time with them. While Maurices segments are older they blend in nicely. Barry and Robins segments are interesting and insightful. You can still feel the hurt over the loss of their two brothers. Been a fan since the beginning saw them once live during their lul in the 70s. Great show. Hardest part for was knowing that Robin would be gone in the not too distant future. Highly recommended,1482451200,6,639,4.517241379310345

4255564,4,B0043E8YAM,"From its very opening ultra-decibel, fire 'n' flashpot-festooned montage of ""You Should Be Dancing"" footage spanning '76 clear through '96 - which then cleverly cuts far back to a '56-vintage Elvis and his similarly dance-crazed ""Blue Suede Shoes"" - it's clear this is going to be one of those far too rare roc doc's which actually has a wise and sharpened sense of socio-historical pop perspective. I mean, who was Tony Manero after all than simply Vince Everett in polyester white as opposed to jailhouse black?

Our ride duly launches out of post-war Manchester, England as Barry, Robin and (via interview footage culled from David Leaf and John Scheinfeld's equally adept&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Where-I-Came-In/dp/B00005KJ0V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Where I Came In</a>&nbsp;documentary) Maurice describe years spent as pre-teen Everly wannabe's who eventually emigrate all the way to Australia, where they form a singing act to perform for spare change at a local race car track. But such is this young trio's charm and already obvious talent that they soon blossom into bonafide Down-Under Beatles:  the televised performance herein of a circa-'64 Bee Gee ""Please Please Me"" alone makes ""In Our Own Time"" nothing short of Required Viewing. Yet the fully airborne promotional footage we're treated to next for their first Number One hit, 1966's still-buoyant ""Spicks and Specks,"" displays a far more Monkee as opposed to Beatle-like mastery of the lip-sync'd absurd.

Returning to their homeland and soon after magically hooking up with none other than Fab sub-manager Robert Stigwood, a recording contract and string of (self-written and purposefully ""melodramatic,"" it is revealed) classics appear in typically Sixties warp-speed. Colourful ""New York Mining Disaster,"" ""I Can't See Nobody,"" ""To Love Somebody,"" ""Massachusetts,"" ""Idea"" and ""Words"" clips follow, and even a glancing view towards each should erase all doubts that The Bee Gees were one of that genius-packed decade's surely most accomplished by far. Case closed.

Caution: What shoots way, way up must of course fall down. So as Sixties become Seventies our heroes found themselves struggling beneath the weight of red velvet-ensconced rock operas, mutinous solo projects, meddling better halves and even their very own ill-fated television spectacular,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cucumber-Castle/dp/B00124LFX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cucumber Castle</a>&nbsp;(which may indeed be much more fun than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magical-Mystery-Tour/dp/B008RTE066/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magical Mystery Tour</a>, though it's certainly no Monkees'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head/dp/6305038694/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head</a>). Once the audio-visual wreckage cleared however, the brothers found themselves chastened enough to not only fully reform, but come up with two unashamedly allegorical gems, ""Lonely Days"" and ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,"" which appeared to all concerned to be their career swansongs.

But! We're less than half-way through our show! And so what exactly did spare The Bee Gees at this critical point from a fate worse than Oldie Goldie residencies near Clacton-on-Sea?

Two words: Arif Mardin.

Luring them to the decidedly more sympathetic climes of Miami's Criteria Recording Studios, then cleverly steering the brothers towards their previously unexplored r'n'b leanings (via Barry's falsetto most pointedly), the result was a slow but steady climb both back onto their feet and then extremely high back up the international sales charts. No further explanation is really needed by me here: At least 100 million of you out there bought the ensuing records.

The backlash, of course, was instant and fierce. ""Bee Gee-Free Weekends"" on radio stations the world over. ""Bee Gee Bonfires"" of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Fever-soundtracks/dp/B000U30IN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Fever soundtracks</a>&nbsp;in Chicago baseball stadiums.

""The enigma with a stigma,"" as Barry still brands The Bee Gees to this very day.

And I'm sure he doesn't just mean the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band-movie/dp/B005EYFP3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band movie</a>&nbsp;either.

Yet for anyone who tuned away from the tale right about here, ""In Our Own Time"" continues on through subsequent years of Gibbs stubbornly continuing to craft monster hits ...only for other singers (Streisand, Celine, The Divine Miss Ross and Kenny and Dolly, for example: why, there's an additional twenty-or-so million in sales right there). Unfortunately, this otherwise platinum period also saw the loss of a severely over-self-medicated Andy Gibb, and the frightful near-exit of a similarly lost ""Brother Mo"" to boot. Most thankfully indeed though, Maurice eventually bounced completely back to help create what, tragically, would be his final Bee Gee masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Where-I-Came-In/dp/B00124MCGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""This Is Where I Came In""</a>&nbsp;before his death on January 12, 2003.

4255576,4,B0043E8YAM,"A great watch with some more extensive footage of old performances than shown in the This Is Where I Came In documentary done some 10 years earlier.  It was a nice change just having the Bee Gees interviewed rather than third parties.  Included are modern interviews with Barry and Robin Gibb circa 2010 (Robin passed on two years later in 2012) and interview clips with Maurice Gibb before his death in 2003 (the interviews were either re-used or deleted clips from the This Is Where I Came In documentary - thankfully, they stripped enough interview clips from that documentary that there was enough original material for this one).

Things I learned from this DVD (WARNING: not necessarily accurate - just what I gathered from the biography):

1) Barry Gibb should not wear a cowboy hat.

2) Each brother is very different.  Barry Gibb is the Alpha Lion of the Bee Gees - an extremely talented writer, calm, but dominating and very protective; Robin Gibb is the smart one with a bullheaded personality and a voice of an angel - he's also often the quiet one, especially when Barry is around (it's hard to compete with those teeth and that hairy chest); Maurice Gibb is the ""nice and funny one"" and obviously the secret weapon behind the technical aspects of the music - i.e. the expert harmonist, multi-instrumentalist, arranger, composer and underrated glue that kept Barry and Robin from punching each other for over 50 years.

3) Andy Gibb liked cocaine and alcohol... a lot.

4) Maurice Gibb liked alcohol even more than Andy. But, it's okay, Mo, I forgive you - I'd start using drink as a crutch too if I was sandwiched in between two dominating brothers with more hair than me for my whole life.

5) Barry Gibb stole the good genes, but Robin fought back with awesome flowing hair.

6) Robin Gibb was the most hilarious looking child I have ever seen.

7) Barry Gibb has very distracting teeth.

8) I feel bad for Maurice Gibb - one gets the sense he suppressed a lot of himself for his brothers and hid a troubled past behind his trademark smile.

9) I feel bad for Robin Gibb for having to compete with the Barry Alpha Lion Gibb.  Physically speaking, it's just not fair - Barry could drop-kick Robin any day of the week.  But, judging from this biography, Maurice would probably sacrifice himself to be drop-kicked in place of Robin so he could get his brothers to go back to writing music.

10) I don't feel bad for Barry Gibb, strangely.

11) Lonely Days is still my favorite Bee Gees song.  Thank you, Mo, for those melody lines and your obsession with the piano.",1362960000,,2578,4.616228070175438

But, No...they wanted to hurry up and get on with the discussion about the ""Saturday Night Fever"" concept which is probably the highlight of their career.  My wife enjoyed the late seventies era of the seventies.  But, even that came up short of their output of that era.

They mentioned nothing about the film ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and all them other artists involved with the movie and soundtrack.  An album soundtrack that charted up to #5, and even included a hit single from Robin Gibb singing ""Oh Darling"". Nothing was mentioned of the whole concept.  I wouldn't watch the movie ever again, but I still wish it was discussed on this documentary.

And yes, there was a lot of grainy film footage of their past, but I expected that.  You can only improve poor film quality, only so much.  So this, I will not complain about because this was expected.

But, like I said: Things that are of interest to me about the Bee Gees were vaguely discussed or were totally ""not there"" at all.

But I think what I hated wasn't their music so much as that whole Studio 54 mentality. They, themselves, are pretty normal--not like some groups whose names I won't mention-- the ones that care little if nothing for the music, it's all about the chicks, drugs, partying, etc. that they're after, and it shows. But I sat down the other night and watched a two-hour program on Biography called ""In Our Own Time"" and, little by little, I became fascinated with them, as composers and muscians and people. Barry Gibb is like ""The Miraculous Pitcher""-- he never runs out of songs. He's got to be one of the most prolific rock composers. (Robin too, of course!) That and their sometimes-haunting, sometimes dance-til-you-drop melodies really bowl me over. They're gifted and truly, deeply creative. What a kick to see them all when they were just little boys. I am drawn to the clarity of their voices and the really amazing way they have of effortlessly slipping into harmonies as if it were the most natural thing. All my favorite groups use harmony and I think it's such a beautiful sound-- it gives a resonance nothing else can. The Bee Gees, apart from having five songs in America's Top Ten at once, actually had five number One singles in 50 years of music-- once for each decade.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Where-I-Came-In-The-Official-Story-of-the-Bee-Gees/dp/B00005KJ0V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Where I Came In - The Official Story of the Bee Gees</a>

4255596,5,B0043E8YAM,"The DVD begins with a montage of the Bee Gees performing You Should Be Dancing over the decades - not a chronological montage, but one that moves back and forth through time.  This really captures many aspects of the brothers:  talent, showmanship, professionalism, timelessness...  It was a great way to begin a DVD with this theme, ""In Our Own Time"" - something that is more autobiography than history, actually.

Prior biographies came from someone else's perspective; this one focuses on the brothers' perspective.  Thus, ""our own"" time.  It is written while events are still unfolding, and two of the brothers are still alive and active.  Thus, ""in our... time"".  Years from now, there will be a time to look back historically; this is the time to hear and preserve their thoughts and feelings in their own words and from their own perspective and while they are still active.

True, there are many clips that can be seen in other biographies.  How could it be otherwise when the subject is a very famous singing group?  But there are clips that are unique.  I especially enjoyed seeing them in the recording studio, coming up with the ""explosion"" sound in Tragedy:  the entire moment was shown from  idea to perfection of it.

Each segment has its own revelations and/or special moments.  However, I was most moved by the final one about the loss of Maurice onward.  The special scene of Mo and Yvonne together, looking out over the water, reminds us of the deep personal loss of the husband, father, and brother.  The two brothers discussing the loss itself and how they dealt with it differently (etc) was very moving.  This ends with Barry and Robin singing How Can You Mend a Broken Heart (first verse and chorus).  It brought tears, for phrases like ""I was never told about the sorrows"" have such gut-wrenching meaning when sung by someone who has lost his TWIN brother, and you've just heard him and Barry share about that loss.  Yes, they did indeed struggle with ""how do you mend a broken heart"" and they eventually have come out of that dark time and are closer to each other than ever before.  One can't put into words what one sees as one watches this segment, but it is the most heartfelt and deep segment in any biography about them that I have seen.

My copy has none of the problems some have mentioned (regarding quality).  Some computer programs in digital players of varying types and sources may be more compatible with specific media.  All I know is the quality as I viewed this DVD was excellent.",1293667200,5,2523,4.69248291571754
