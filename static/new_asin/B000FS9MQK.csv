8126118,5,B000FS9MQK,"This DVD teaches about oriental rhythms. It's amazing for bellydancer learners.
And include a bonus CD to practice. Perfect for all people interested in oriental rhythms.",1361491200,,170,5.576923076923077
8126119,4,B000FS9MQK,"Sincerly, I was searching for explainations about the relationship between drummer and dancer. I studied two years bellydance as dancer and I'm a beginner at darbuka, my goal is not the show but more sharing good time with friends playing together. I was looking for an exchange about their experiences which gives you clues and philosiphy.
I don't know how to rate this dvd, because it's the best dvd I have seen to give to anyone who wants to discover bellydance world.
So, in a ""passiv"" use, to have a good time, I felt it really good and educational.
But in a ""activ"" goal, to improve my skills. This dvd had been, not 100%, but 90% unusefull.
Maybe more advanced dancers or drummers than me are able to catch by themself good tips in this dvd. But me not.
The aesthetics is really impressiv and the making of is a great part of the dvd. I learned good tips watching it.
In conclusion, I'm happy to have it even it was not what I have expected.",1212796800,,948,4.392045454545454
8126120,4,B000FS9MQK,"This is a very useful and entertaining guide to Oriental Dance (bellydance) rhythms. The focus is on Egyptian rhythms, so it does not include some of the popular Turkish rhythms found on other Bellydance Rhythm dvds. The package includes a dvd, 31 page booklet, and audio cd. The audio, video and written segments all work well together and are nicely packaged.

During the dvd demonstration segment, Nesma and Egyptian drummer Khamis Henkesh share a friendly banter about the Egyptian rhythms. They have a friendly rapport which is entertaining as well as educational. They discus  what is special about each rhythm, some variations and the drummer shares some of his technique for playing the rhythm. The dancer than dances to the rhythm showing examples of how different moves can fit the music.

The demonstration/discussion segment concludes with a performance that offers an inspirational demonstration of how a drummer and dancer can collaborate.  The dvd also features a rhythm Karaoke that can be used for drum, dance or finger cymbal practice.

Some things to consider before purchasing this set: 1--the dialog is primarily in Arabic, so if like me you don't speak Arabic, you will need to read subtitles. That actually helped me focus on what they were saying as I had to make a special effort to follow along. 2--The dancer does not break down the moves so this is not a good introductory dance/rhythm dvd for a newer dancer. If you are looking for something more basic,  Jenna's ""Heartbeat of Bellydance"" dvd might be a better place to start.

This dvd will be best for intermediate to advanced dancers and percussionists--especially those interested in Egyptian styles of Oriental Dance and music.",1183334400,10,1711,5.067615658362989
8126121,4,B000FS9MQK,"Nesma, a Spanish Oriental dancer with years of professional experience dancing in Egypt, hosts Egyptian master percussionist Khamis Henkesh for a discussion and demonstration of fundamental Arabic rhythms. Together they discuss the background and performance of each rhythm, Henkesh demonstrates them, and Nesma dances to them. Then there is an instructional segment in which Henkesh teaches each rhythm step by step for the Darbuka. There is also a ""karaoke"" section designed for playing and/or dancing along. And finally there is an extended performance improvisation by Henkesh and Nesma. The CD contains percussion only rhythm tracks again suitable for playing and/or dancing along, and the detailed booklet (in Spanish, French, and English) guides you through the whole package with detailed notation of the rhythms. The DVD is 135 minutes long, the CD 45. Nicely packaged.",1159056000,17,878,5.559701492537314
