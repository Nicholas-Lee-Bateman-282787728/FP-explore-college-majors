6424193,1,B00KFNF2DM,"If they had spent as much time fact-checking this six-hour series as promoting it, it may have been a classic.  Instead, it's a six-hour series of mistakes, anachronisms, and superficial repetition.

Numerous mistakes, falsehoods and drunk history. Churchill visited bombed out areas of London every night during the Blitz? Really? The German air raids came at night.

6424225,5,B00KFNF2DM,"This series is riveting. I especially liked the way they juxtaposed the characters and events so that you knew which things were happening simultaneously. This gives a bird's eye perspective that is very hard sometimes to distinguish when reading historical events. Also, I appreciate the way they showed the connection between the two world wars, the way in which the ""peace"" of the first inevitably set in place the second ""war.""",1493942400,6,431,5.084507042253521

6424231,4,B00KFNF2DM,"It is an entertaing docu-drama and A good way to engage students. However, there are some inacurracies. One that stands out is the scene where Hitler was spared bythe British soldier, Henry Tandey. There is no mention of the fact that historians are almost certain that Hitler mistook Tandey for the soldier who didn't kill him.",1488672000,2,328,4.875
6424232,5,B00KFNF2DM,"This was an excellent introduction for students beginning to study the World Wars. It truly helps them understand the ""how did we get to that point"" question. I especially liked that none of the men were made out to be perfect, just exceptional-in a good or a bad way. I appreciate the effort to tell the story of these men in the conflicts as fully as possible while still making it a truly entertaining series. My students loved it. If I don't have time to go further in depth with the subject (they'll get more of that in later years), this was a lovely intro, and best of all, it piqued their interest in cause and effect of historical events.",1486598400,,647,4.4

I actually watching the series on the History channel a few years ago, and decided I had to buy the set.  Very informative, and a good mix of information and acting.

6424256,2,B00KFNF2DM,"Just started watching this production, and I must say I'm pretty disappointed.  I've been studying the world wars for decades now, and the lapses in continuity displayed in this mini series are pretty glaring.  The first portion dealing with WW1 is pretty well done.  Using M3 Stuart light tanks for Patton's tank battle is forgivable given the difficulties, no doubt, in finding FT17s for the scenes.  Moving on to the portrayal of the attacks on Poland and England, however, things go south.  While there is ample archival film of Junkers, Dorniers, and Heinkels over Britain during the Blitzkrieg and Battle of Britain, the producers use footage of B17s.  B17s?  I'm sorry to say I'm a little insulted by that.  Who ever made that call has no business In the history business.  I'll finish watching the series, but I may never pick it up again.  I wonder how botched the rest of it is.  NOT recommended!",1468540800,2,906,4.780645161290322

6424265,3,B00KFNF2DM,"There are some historically things that are inaccurate. For example, Hitler's uniform was wrong for ALL WWII parts.  His jacket during the war was a feldgrau, not Nazi party brown. Further, his 'Sam Brown' belt as portrayed in this is completely wrong. It is portrayed here as a dark brown, almost black; where historically it was BEFORE THE WAR a russet brown. Also, during the segment portraying Patton and MacArthur getting shown during WWI, there is a gross inaccuracy as to and the rank worn by Patton and how he is addressed, AND there is also a portrayal of a WWI tank battle featuring Patton which shows in the WWI setting a tank that DID NOT exist in that period: A Stuart Tank. Aside from these historic fails, the series is well executed, and by and large, well done.",1465862400,2,778,4.597122302158273

6424276,5,B00KFNF2DM,Delivered on time and works perfectly. I love this new style of creating a documentary with actors and showing the changes of big historical figures and the countries through the wars.,1460937600,,184,4.967741935483871
6424277,5,B00KFNF2DM,"This was a great quick and dirty doc., I thought they integrated WWI and WWII and its leaders pretty well considering they were talking about 2 wars, how they started, and about Churchill, FDR, Stalin, Patton, Tojo, McArthur, Mussolini, and Hitler in one doc. All other docs are about only the war and we forget about the people that had to make the decisions. Great dramatizations too, but they kind of just insert some battle scenes over and over throughout the doc and it kinda looks lazy.
I really wish they had described Eisenhower but they totally left him out of this. They did a mini featurette about him and it had some basic info. but it wasn't a lot. Still, the featurettes are pretty quick and give a nice basic history lesson in about 5 minutes. If you need to do a presentation on some of those topics you could probably use the featurettes to BS your way through a presentation.
Great overall, loved it. Perfect for any WWI or WWII or history buff.",1459641600,,963,4.508571428571429

6424280,5,B00KFNF2DM,Great series that teaches a lot about WW2. I let my U.S. History teacher borrow it and he said that it was detailed enough about the curriculum to show the class. Best thing History Channel has put on for a long time and would highly recommend.,1458518400,,244,4.326086956521739
6424281,5,B00KFNF2DM,"This video attempts to provide context for WW2. This is done with personal biographies, not with national history. I think this gives insight to decisions and what motivated these leaders. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that there are broader and deeper forces at work. For example, the rise of Marxism, nationalism, Darwinism, capitalism, militarism, etc., etc..

Video focuses just a few prominent leaders. MacArthur the military genius; Patton the soldier with lust for battle; Churchill the statesman determined to save western (British) civilization; Stalin the tyrant planning to succeed where Hitler failed; Roosevelt the one with the most influence; Hitler the ex-corporal commanding the entire German military; Mussolini the one who taught Hitler how to take control; Rommel the skeptical genius; Tojo the imperialist; Bradley the humble general; all these are well done!

One theme is the deep trauma WW1 inflicted on the men discussed. Churchill haunted by the massacre at Gallipoli, Hilter enraged because Germany surrendered 'without being defeated', MacArthur overconfident from past success, Stalin exporting communism as a new world revolution, and so on. This method connects ideas, experiences and decisions that gives more than isolated facts, but understanding.

For example, covers the reasons why Truman dropped the bombs. This was in part to forestall Stalin from invading first, along with avoiding another Normandy invasion.

Empathizes the unique place of this war in human history. Nothing similar before. Shows Colin Powell saying 'that nothing like this (can?should? will?) happen again.' Highlights Patton discovering the camps. Appalled. He then forced German soliders and citizens to tour and experience the shame. (I had never heard this. Facinating.)

This is human history that should never be forgotten.",1458000000,7,1850,5.664259927797834

6424311,1,B00KFNF2DM,"I received The World Wars on Blu-ray as a Christmas gift from someone who knows how much I enjoy history in general and the history of  World Wars I and II in particular. When I began watching The World Wars,  I did so with great anticipation

And was immediately very disappointed by what I saw. The World Wars, a three-part historical documentary first broadcast on The History Channel in 2014,  is excellent in concept but positively dreadful in execution. It contains several egregious flaws that are, in my view, inexcusable for a program that seeks to tell the history of one of the most important eras of the 20th century.

The show uses dramatizations of historical events that bear little resemblance to what actually happened. Actors are used that do not look anything like the historical figures (Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, etc.) they are supposed to portray. Narration is overwrought, and commentary from talking head pundits (mainly historians and politicians) contains several grievous factual errors that should have been caught and corrected before these episodes were ever broadcast. On top of these serious flaws, I found both the video and audio quality of the entire series barely adequate for the Blu-ray format. .

Ive read some online reviews of The World Wars  that seem to imply that these faults are acceptable because this miniseries is primarily designed to introduce history to those who are unfamiliar with it. I respectfully disagree with this premise. I think it makes no sense and serves no purpose to broadcast any historical documentary that contains errors of historical fact. The writers and producers at the History Channel should have known better. Not recommended.",1451606400,4,1715,5.14748201438849

6424340,5,B00KFNF2DM,"First, it should be noted that this is not so much of a history of two World Wars, but a character study on the major (and some minor) players.  What first drew me to this documentary was the fact that it starts with World War I, and how that war shaped the people who would clash again some 20 years later.  This doc also points out that this was really all one war. (The 31 year war)

Some of the intriguing issues covered are:

What's with Hitler's funny little mustache?
How Hitler's supreme ego helped save the world.
Why did the Japanese switch sides from one war to another?
What was the young, and arrogant, Churchill's reality check that would make him England's savior in latter years
How George Patton became a strong proponent of mobile gun platforms
Why did we ally ourselves with Stalin, who has as bad as Hitler
Why Stalingrad was so important to the allied cause
Why the U.S. was fighting the Japanese alone after Germany surrendered
And many more...",1440460800,,966,4.5344827586206895

WWII is my absolute favorite period in history and this miniseries does it a justice, at least to my liking.

6424377,1,B00KFNF2DM,"Watching this monstrosity makes clear why Americans are ignorant of history or only have ""conventional wisdom"" implanted in their crania. The shows  (they are no more than that, the two dvd's) are poorly cast: Roosevelt looks too young and his face is too full, Stalin is far too young and Hitler's appearance also leaves much to be desired in terms of verisimilitude. The content is largely made up of interruptions with much talk by pompous academic windbags rather than showing actual footage of the wars as appeared in The World at War, which, despite a certain editorializing aspect provided by Laurence Olivier, the narrator, was far superior to this pathetic product. How many inaccuracies are to be found in it I cannot say. When I heard that at Midway all four Japanese carriers were destroyed in minutes, I knew something was wrong. At 10 AM dive bombers did set the Kaga, Akagi and Soryu on fire, but the Hiryu was not located and attacked until seven hours later.
As per the jingoistic-exclusivistic content of many American versions of the war in Europe, the central role of the Red Army in defeating Germany was downplayed, and the pivotal battles of Kursk (July, 1943) and Operation Bagration (June-July, 1944) were ignored. Kursk stopped Germany's last offensive in the East in which the Reich used up its strategic reserve and was from then on forced to go on the defensive and Bagration, aka the destruction of Army Group Center, tore the heart out of the Wehrmacht in the East and sealed Germany's fate. The former was much more significant than the invasion of Sicily and the latter a much more serious contretemps for the Germans than the landings in Normandy. There are books on both subjects out there for those who doubt the value of relying on videos for a serious understanding of history. Read them, and if desirous of flickering images to view, obtain The World at War. Above all else, forget once and for all The World Wars.",1434153600,3,1953,4.795252225519288

6424382,5,B00KFNF2DM,"This is one of the most creative and ambitious projects to come out of the HISTORY channel's endeavors.  It gives us an overview of many historical figures who participated in both World Wars:  George Patton, Douglas MacArthur, Winston Churchill, uncle Joe Stalin and Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini(among others).  It also includes FDR, although he had little to do with WWI.  Patton morphed from a fine officer into a great General.  Churchill morphed from a failed military leader into a landmark Prime Minister in British history.  Meanwhile, Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin made the transition from soldiers to mass murderers.

To be clear:  the episodes zero in on the contributions of the people entailed in the docudrama.  As such, it omits many major battles in WWII (Coral Sea, Saipan and Guadalcanal among them).  It is not an ""end-to-end"" narrative of either war.  On the upside, it does clarify as to how Italy and Japan were both incensed after WWI from their being denied any substantial gains in spite of being on the winning side.  This, of course, laid the seeds for WWII right on the heels of the treaty of Versailles.  Interesting.

The weakest part of the docudrama would be the inclusion of Dick Cheney and Donny Rumsfeld.  Both proved themselves to be invidious paragons of incompetence in their respective roles in the Bush (43) administration and neither is an ""authority"" on anything.  While it is surreal to hear Cheney extol(!) the leadership of a Democrat (FDR), he should nonetheless go back to duck hunting & leave the exegesis of history to the big boys.  Oh, wait...

In sum, this is a fine documentary  / docudrama that spans both of the biggest conflicts of the 20th century.  Indeed, the 2 biggest wars that the world has ever seen.  If you even have a passing interest in any of the major players, then this DVD is a must-have for your historical collection.",1431734400,,1895,4.859375

It brings details and little known facts about the background of the characters from their early days as soldiers or politicians in WWI to the final days of WWII. The actors chosen to portray the real subjects present the similarities in physical attributes as seen of the actual ones from old archival footage. I was very impressed by that. I won't give out any spoilers about some of the defining parts of the series, but I will say that it will hold your attention from beginning to end.

As far as the Blu-ray format I will say that is the best way to truly enjoy this feature. I saw it when it was broadcast on the History Channel HD channel and watching it again on Blu-ray format showed how much better it can be. The narration and commentary by military, historians, veterans, and other experts on the background and history of these leaders and the conflict settings, add to the detail and comprehension of the subject at hand.

6424487,1,B00KFNF2DM,"This is possibly the most disappointing documentary I have watched and I have seen quite a few that misrepresented historical facts. Visually, it is very good and while the idea of concentrating on a few key figures and how their WW I experiences formed their outlooks is a reasonable approach it suffers from the impression that these figures are the whole story. For example, the series seems to suggest that only people like Patton and Macarthur were responsible for the Allied victory. Additionally, the factual mistakes are too numerous to mention such as Patton conquering Italy in 6 weeks when he was relieved of command and did not set foot in Italy at all. In fact, German forces in Northern Italy did not surrender until May 1945. Also, the USSR entering the war with Japan in 1945 is shown as Stalin's grab for control of the Far East. This is only partially correct as he had agreed to enter the war against Japan within 3 months of Germany's surrender. I was going to give this DVD away as it is so full of errors but I did not want to pollute the minds of those who have not studied the period in detail. So, I have kept it to show others an example of misrepresenting history.",1414713600,17,1191,4.518518518518518

The first installment about the key figures, Hitler, Churchill, Stalin, Patton, Montgomery, and more,  was such an eye-opener about these men in their younger years.  I had no idea how the Treaty of Versailles basically set the stage for World War II, and that it was essentially just a continuation of World War I with a 20 year gap in the middle.

The 3 parts that stood out to me are when they were talking about the German blitzkrieg strategy but then they cut to an internal view of a building with a Russian t54 about to blow the building up? Not even the same era. Or the part they were talking about Patton in Italy and then show a convoy of m48 Patton's being ambushed? Again hardly the same era.

And the last part is when they were talking about the Japanese navy and then cut to (u guessed it) a modern Japanese missle cruiser. Other than these 3 parts the documentary was very good.

6424546,3,B00KFNF2DM,"As an overview it's okay! But the omissions are for the most part simply dumb. How can you possibly almost totally omit , Kaiser Wilhelm, Czar Nicholas, Eisenhower, Bradley, all Brits except Churchill (sorry Monty) the North African campaign and so on.

Well it's easy and they did. The truth is the show is like a more truthful National Inquirer version of the war, concentrating on the headliners over a thirty year period of time. All was sorta simplified and condensed for drama and time limitations not unlike reality TV.. I guess they thought the short video clips on the second disk would answer all pertinent questions about the war in a connect the dot type of fashion. Go figure!

So when you see Patton chasing banditos with a machine gun mounted on on a touring car in 1914 and shooting hundreds of rounds and hitting nothing you know he could not be the only one who developed motorized warfare. Not depicting Hitlers death accurately is also inexcusable . The man was a beaten empty shell, a shadow of his once self yet they portrayed his death as a warrior's sacrifice. They portrayed glory when there was non to be had.

So now if your wondering when i am going to shut up, well let me conclude.

If you consider yourself  somewhat of a historian, well this series will come off like World Wars for Dummies vol 1. If you are the average guy .looking to increase your knowledge about the bloodiest century known to man, well it will do that but i recommend you get the British series World at War which in my opinion is the best documentary out there.

The BBC produced ""World at War"" series is much more an accurate and incise view of the second world war with many explanations coming directly from the mouths of the people involved (the series was produced in the early '70's with many of the involved characters still alive, the interview with Hitler's personnel Secretary is very interesting).",1408147200,,496,5.060975609756097
6424551,3,B00KFNF2DM,"This series is very difficult to review.  I enjoyed it and found the story quite well told.  On the other hand, some of the glaring errors are very difficult to overlook.  Given that the series targets a general audience, I think we should overlook lack of detail in various events and even the omission of some major players, though the omission of Eisenhower is difficult to fathom.

I want to give The History Channel a pat on the back for making the effort to keep history alive in an increasingly lackadaisical and appallingly uninformed western world.  I think three stars is probably overly generous, however, due to information in the series which is just plain wrong.  For example, I couldn't believe it when Gen. Colin Powell ""explained"" that Churchill first encountered war in the trenches of WWI.  Amazing!  As a young officer, Churchill had seen heavy fighting in Northwest India (Pakistan today), the Sudan (in a cavalry charge) and the Boer War before WWI.  In fact, he was a POW for a time during the Boer War before escaping.  He had also been under fire as an observer in the Cuban Insurrection against the Spanish.  There is just no excuse for something that totally incorrect.

Nearly all of the infantry soldiers depicted in combat are armed with British designed Lee-Enfield rifles (Germans, Americans and Japanese). In the footage detailing The Blitz and the Battle of Britain, German combat camera footage of German fighters destroying American B-17's is supposed to represent British fighters destroying German bombers. I wonder what the WWII vets who served in those B-17's would think of being Nazi stand-ins for this documentary. It just makes me wonder why the researchers would have been so lax in the details when there is plenty of British gun camera footage depicting British pilots shooting down German planes.

6424568,3,B00KFNF2DM,"Three stars is generous but there were some parts I enjoyed.

I understand the tagline for this documentary has to do with men who became key figures in World War II and how World War I made them into the men they were but World War I was completely brushed aside.  This is not a documentary to learn about history, it's not even a good overview.

The documentary begins with Hitler and doesn't even mention Gavrilo Princip assassinating Franz Ferdinand which was the catalyst for all this in the first place.  There's no mention of the national tensions between Britain, Germany, Russia, France etc. that planted the seeds for WWI.  No mention of the Three Cousins or what each side had to lose.  The Russian Revolution was mentioned only once and inaccurately and there's hardly if any mention of the sinking of the Luisitania which sparked American calls for intervention after wanting to remain neutral.

World War II was better but not much.

One of the two bright spots of this documentary were an okay overview of the peace of 1919 and the conditions that led to World War II.  However it left out the Spanish Civil War which is seen as a precursor to World War II.  The other was the dramatizations which gave the viewer a glimpse into the time and what the key figures were dealing with.  The music was also good.

Obviously it is impossible to include everything in a 30+ year period in a less than 3 hour documentary, however more could've been done to make it more accurate and reflective of what actually happened.",1403913600,2,1527,4.614814814814815
6424569,3,B00KFNF2DM,"I liked this program, including the actors who were mostly good.  I noted that MacArthur called Patton ""lieutenant"" when he was a lieutenant colonel, which would never have happened.  I also noted that they had some exceptionally distinguished historians including and especially Sir Max Hastings, who is always excellent.  The gimmick in this presentation was to use modern day politicians including Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and John McCain to tell us what the wars meant.  McCain had an especially prominent role.  Almost all of the politicians used in this series (except Leon Panetta) were strong supporters of the Iraq war.  By presenting themselves as sages on the World Wars were they trying to imply that they made the correct calls in Iraq?  Or am I inferring this when it was never really implied?  Guess people will have to decide for themselves.",1403481600,,862,5.0638297872340425
6424570,2,B00KFNF2DM,"While ""The World Wars"" was macro-ly correct, there were so many mistakes in the presentation, even historical accuracy, this series is a marginally correct historical docudrama. The first big mistake, in my opinion, was leaving out Eisenhower. I know, Eisenhower was overshadowed by MacArthur's supposed genius, and Patton's personality, but Eisenhower was in charge of the American army from the African campaigns all the way through Italy when he left to prepare for Operation Overlord, the amphibious attack on France. Not once was he mentioned. Bradley, as well, was neglected. Bradley was the one general who reprimanded Patton for his slapping the war weary soldier, which was shown in this movie and in the movie ""Patton."" Bradley then became the second in charge after Patton was relieved of his command.

Some of the faults:

Generals MacArthur and Marshall were shown with the five-star ""General of the Army"" insignia which weren't given until after the conflict was over.

MacArthur wore a tie all of the time. He rarely wore a tie, especially during WWII.

The series showed MacArthur as a genius while leading the troops in the Pacific, in reality MacArthur was unprepared when the Japanese attacked the Phillipines and committed troops to doom to obtain minimal results, particularly in New Guinea. Also, the movie also indicated that MacArthur's planning went from the Phillipines to directly to the landings on ""mainland"" Japan, in fact, we had many more large islands to attack prior to the proposed 'operation Olympic' which was to be the actual landings on mainland Japan. Formosa and Okinawa to name two.

While Patton showed remarkable tank skills in France, when he was in charge of troops in Africa, many soldiers died unnecessarily because of his poor leadership. In the movie ""Patton,"" he did not stop Rommel in his tracks, Rommel out-foxed everyone and only had to pull out of Africa when he lost his supply chain. Rommel retreated to Italy virtually un-molested with all of his troops and equipment while the allies stood around smoking cigarettes.

The destroyers shown were of the modern type: Guided Missile Destroyers. When showing paratroopers in the air, you can see  C131's in the background, an airplane that wasn't made until the 60's.

I suggest to the reader to not waste your time renting this monstrosity. The acting is terrible, none of the actors represented their characters well; the story is lame and the facts are not complete. Instead of six hours, this story could be told in 30 minutes. I learned nothing new, it is definitely not in the same league as ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" which are by far the most realistic WWII movies available.",1403481600,3,2705,5.03579418344519

6424572,4,B00KFNF2DM,"First of all I teach US History at the Jr High and High School level so I know quite a bit on these topics, and I believe this three part series is very good and I would recommend giving it a look. Sure it leaves out many famous important characters from World War II (in particular the much mentioned Dwight David Eisenhower from comments above), but the video series was not intended to be an all inclusive account of the war. Instead this video series chooses to discuss a handful of famous individuals that had connections to the two world wars, both as simple soldiers, future generals, and world leaders. I gave this video series 4/5 stars since as many have said above, it does skip certain details that might lead one to fill in the blanks, like the tank invention, but it never says the US invented it (this is just jumping to an incorrect conclusion). The style in which the series was created tells the stories of these men and is not meant to be full of history lesson details of the entire war, for what it is designed to do it does very well and it is very interesting. I would recommend it.",1402531200,2,1105,4.368932038834951
6424573,3,B00KFNF2DM,"I enjoyed this entire series and I do feel its' worth watching. But the viewer has to go into it knowing that's its value is in the broad overview of how World War 1 shaped the people and nations involved in World War 2.

You cannot watch this for the small details and expect to learn anything because many of the small details are just flat out wrong.

General Eisenhower is almost completely left out of the entire thing. That's inexcusable. Admiral Yamamoto of Japan, teh guy who planned the Pearl Harbor attacks and adamently argued with his government that it was a bad idea is 100% left out of this 3 part series without so much as his name being mentioned once. That's just insane. He was a major figure of the war and he doesn't exist in this documentary.

Also there is no mention of how hard the US worked to hide Roosevelt's paralysis. They went to extreme efforts to make him look perfectly fine so he didn't appear weak to the Axis Powers. That's not mentioned once. They barely mention his polio and paralysis at all.

And World War 1 was sparked when Archduke Ferdinand was shot. 3 decades of warfare where hundreds of millions died all sparked by the assasination of Ferdinand. You'd think they would have mentioned his name. But nope.

Then they start taking liberties with facts. For instance Adolf Hitler had a dorky looking mustach. That's a fact. Hitler was also in a gas attack in trenched in World War 1. That's a fact. But this series connects those two facts and makes it look like Hitler's inability to get his gas mask sealed in World War 1 caused him to immediately shave the handlebars off his mustashe, giving him his goofy looking famous mustashe right there in the WWI trenches. I've never seen any suggestion that happened anywhere. It was neat in a dramatic sense, but not a historical one.

It also says that the United States was pulled into World War 1 when a plan by the Germans to fund the war with Mexico to keep the US occupied backfired due to the American people finding out about the plan. That's all well and good and is factually documented, but that was more of a broad call to war. The overt act that had Americans demanding intervetion into the war was the sinking of Lusitania by a German U-Boat. I don't think that was mentioned. If it was, the Lusitania wasn't mentioned by name. And U-Boats don't come up at all.

Where this series shines is showing the higher level look at how the events of World War 1 shaped the way World War 2 played out. It doesn't tell you much (at least not accurately) about Hitler the man. But it shows very well how the conditions in Germany allowed the Nazi party to rise to power and how similar conditions could lead to similar results again elsewhere in the world. It does the same thing for other events in the wars as well, but at that ""Concept"" level. Not the ""Detail"" level.

To some extent I understand leaving some things out. It's a 4 and a half our series (without commercials) to document what happened on 3 continents over a 30 year span. It can't possible include everything. So I get that it can't go into detail on things like how Hitler when from not being anti-semetic in his youth to redefining the very meaning of anti-semetism in his later years. That one thing is a 3 hours documentary in itself (and a VERY interesting one) But it can't be develd into in a broad overview like this one. There are a hundred things like this that are truncated from this series and I totally understand those kind of omissions.

But omitting major characters like Yamamoto and Eisenhower? And getting the details they do include about everyone else wrong? It's inexcusable. And U-Boats. Not a single mention of U-Boats. The powerhouse of the German Navy....not even mentioned.

I did think they did a great job of showing what a sniveling little coward Neville Chamberlain was. And how a policy of appeasement will always cost you more in the long run.

Overall it's worth watching. But don't put a lot of stock in the details. Watch it for the larger picture.",1402272000,5,4048,4.523939808481532
6424574,1,B00KFNF2DM,"I'm actually pretty disappointed in the mini-series. It's very superficial, as if it was lifted from Wikipedia. There are small inaccuracies, such as showing General MacArthur wearing his 5-star insignia during a 1930's meeting with FDR, when such a rank was even created until 1944. There are omissions, such as ignoring the fact that Patton was wounded on the battlefield during WWI, leaving him with a feeling that he really didn't contribute to the war effort (despite the success he had) and leaving him chomping at the bit to get another major conflict to prove himself in (read his biography by Carlo D'Este and you'll see that)....and glaring inaccuracies, such as suggesting that the Bolshevik partnership of Lenin and Stalin overthrew the Czar (This is inaccurate for two reasons... Stalin's own propaganda suggested he played much more of a key role in support Lenin than he actually did. Lenin, in fact, did not trust Stalin... but was willing to use him..... the other inaccuracy is that the Bolsheviks did not storm anything and oust the Czar... there were protests from all over Russia, leading to Czar Nicholas' ministers and military advisers recommended he abdicate... which he did, in favor of provisional government that the Bolsheviks actually DID overthrow 8 months later)...

with the way the series was promoted, I expected something much more detailed and involved. Needless to say, I'm disappointed",1402185600,17,1424,5.1645021645021645
6424585,3,B00KFNF2DM,"Way too many minutes showing Hitler trimming his moustache.  We all know how he ends up looking i.e. DORKAMUNDO as Fonzie would say.

It appears to be a weird young/old Hitler, Churchill, FDR, Patton and MacArthur exercise but the Patton and MacArthur segments really perk up the series.  It's great how they and Churchill prepped for the return of war since they were firmly convinced of Germany's ""I'll be back nature.""

Hitler is presented as if he were some grass roots DIY-er who managed to hold an entire country under his hypnotic sway but the series succeeds in communicating that he was a failure and probably afraid of holding a regular job hence his insistence on an artistic career for which he was not qualified.  What he represents is everybody else in Germany who went Nahtzee on the rest of the world and this series like everything else from History/Discovery/Military/American Hero channel hints that Hitler was just a frontman for the real power in Germany behind both world wars.

By using these individuals from different countries to tell the story, the series is able to bring up issues like the fact that America was distracted by war with Mexico and coincidentally, we were finally brought into war with the discovery of the Zimmerman telegram wherein Germany offers Mexico help in taking back territory such as ... Texas.

Bearing in mind that in 1915, Germany was mentoring the Ottoman Turks re the Armenian Genocide and that Turkey with Germany formed the Central Powers.

So maybe getting caught redhanded assassinating their own Habsburg royal to start WW1 spurred the real masterminds to use an actor who found himself after WW1 directed by government to infiltrate the Workers Party.  It all looks like a huge set up to get out of the Versailles Treaty and rearm and rewage war after the ceasefire of WW1.",1402185600,3,1837,4.881028938906752
6424586,5,B00KFNF2DM,"I think most of the negative reviews on here have missed the entire point of this series.  Much like how Fox's ""Cosmos"" series is introducing science concepts to the non-science general public, this show is introducing history to the non-history general public.  Granted ""Cosmos"" does not play nearly as loose with details and facts, it is also 13 episodes long, compared to 3 parts for this series.

In any event, all of the negative reviews have legitimate points about things that this series missed, or things that it got wrong.  I am a big-time military history buff, and so I am not trying to argue that this series was accurate.  But what these shows were able to accomplish is that they were able to bring this time period to life in a way that other documentaries cannot.  They make you feel as if you are living through the history as it happens; at times it plays like a Hollywood blockbuster.

To me, that is the greatest success of a series like this.  As a history buff, I know how riveting history can be; in my opinion, human history is the greatest story ever told, and the World Wars (combined with the Cold War) were that story's climax.  This series has successfully conveyed this sense of intensity and drama to millions of people who otherwise would never have been able to experience it.  While documentaries like ""The World at War"" are unbelievably better with the facts and details, how many non-history people can sit through that kind of show?  Not many, in my opinion.  Why I liked this series is that it was able to convey the sense of drama and intensity that people like me already know exists in history to people who never thought of history in this way before; it conveys it better than I could ever hope to convey it.  Additionally, Americans are so incredibly ignorant of the First World War, that however inaccurate this series may be at times, this series adequately demonstrates just how important the First World War was; it illustrates how the World Wars were intimately connected and really were just one gigantic war.

If you have friends and family who have told you that they generally do not like history, or that it bores them to death, I couldn't recommend this series enough.  It is the perfect way to introduce to people a new way of looking at history.  I completely understand that every factual error it has is a legitimate knock against it.  But I think it more than makes up for that with each and every person that formerly disliked history, and now decides that maybe they do want to check out a documentary series like ""The World at War"".

6424587,4,B00KFNF2DM,"The History Channel presents a miniseries of six hours on three nights as an overview of the concept that the beginnings of WW I and the events that occurred in that first World War were played out by the same set of characters and in doing so the series presents the backgrounds of each of the major world players in a manner that allows us to see them as individuals rather than historical tropes. Until Amazon makes this available this review is pictured by another series made two years ago with a bit of a different approach. But for those who may be deciding whether or not to catch the current series, hopefully this brief overview will assist.

As the description for the series state, `The World Wars tells the story of three decades of war told through the eyes of various men who were its key players: Roosevelt, Hitler, Patton, Mussolini, Churchill, Tojo, DeGaulle and MacArthur. The series examines the two wars as one contiguous timeline starting in 1914 and concluding in 1945 with these unique individuals coming of age in World War I before ultimately calling the shots in World War II.

Narrated by Jeremy Renner and with comments throughout the series from Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Leon Panetta, John McCain, John Major, Mario Monti and many historians and correspondents form the US and Britain, the series is a collage of battle scenes (some repetitive, but war is repetitive), but adding the young and old versions of Stalin (Jacopo Rampini /not listed), Mussolini (Nabil Vinas/Jonathan Hartman), MacArthur (Prescott Hathaway/not listed), DeGaulle (Michael Perrie. Jr./Don Meehan), Churchill (Tom Vickers/Ian Beyts), Hitler (Maximillian Klas/not listed ), Lenin (C Conrad Cady), Patton (Matt Dearman/Don Hartman), FDR (Kevin McKillip/not listed), and Tojo (not listed).

The series is directed by John Ealer and written by Chelsea Coates, Zachary Hartmann, Claire Lawton, Alec Michod, Jordan Rosenblum, and David White. No, it isn't all the information about he wars but it is a psychological study of the men who were at the helm of each country involved. It is disturbing but the series does provide insights we should appreciate. Grady Harp, June 14",1402012800,3,2176,5.072625698324022

6424590,1,B00KFNF2DM,"I could complain about all the technical foul-ups with the dramatizations, but that has been around long before History Channel came into existence, Hollywood budgets being what they are. What I WILL complain about is a documentary that re-writes history. I'm not sure if the producers simply didn't have any historians available to consult, or if the truth was simply not the story they wanted to tell. Some of the information is simply distortion caused by the timing of the information. But, this documentary also provides information that is simply NOT TRUE, and not all of it is minor details either. For instance:

Patton did NOT conquer Italy in six weeks. In fact, Patton did not conquer Italy. And, the Italian Campaign lasted almost 2 years. Slapping a soldier in Italy got Patton sidelined from the Italian campaign entirely. (The Sicilian campaign was separate from the Italian campaign and was treated separately by most historians and by this documentary.)

To watch this show, you would think the US invented the tank, and Patton personally introduced armored warfare to the world. In fact, Britain invented the tank, and the US had no tanks in World War 1 other than those lent them by the French (and perhaps some from the British).

To watch this show, the breaking of the Japanese codes was done by FDR's Washington code breakers and FDR warned the fleet of the impending Midway attack. Also, the ambush of the Japanese fleet was credited as FDR's ""bold plan"". The HYPO code-breakers that discovered the Japanese plans were in Hawaii and reported to Admiral Nimitz. Nimitz, Fletcher, and Spruance came up with the plans. Also, the documentary's description of the battle is incorrect, misleading, and contains false statements like that four of the carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor were destroyed in under 6 minutes.

To watch this show, you would think that MacArthur was in charge of the entire Pacific campaign, except for FDR's apparent almost direct control at Midway.

To watch this show, you would think that Patton was only put back in the field in order to save US forces at the Bulge. He was put back in the field right after the D-Day landings, months before the Battle of the Bulge, as soon as his part in the deception plans was over.

The show makes a point of claiming that the only reason Hitler attacked Stalingrad was because it was named after Stalin, and that the only reason Stalin defended it was for the same reason. While, no doubt the name of the town was an incentive to both parties, it was a minor one. Hitler's drive to the south was to gain the Caucuses oil fields, and he had to take Stalingrad or leave a huge Russian army on his flanks.

The idea of this series was a good one. Take several key figures in World War 2, and show how their experiences in World War 1 and the intervening depression shaped their lives and through them the World War 2. And, it might even be understandable if they omitted important events that didn't involve the figures they chose. But, it is not understandable when they choose to re-write history in order that the chosen figures are more prominent (Patton and FDR above), or come up with crack-pot un-substantiated ideas and present them as fact (Stalingrad above), or just plain get the history wrong. Dramatic license may be acceptable in a movie, but it does not belong in a documentary, even one containing dramatizations. I hope no students use this entertaining bunch of misinformation as the basis of a report. They'll likely get a failing grade.",1401667200,25,3542,4.787234042553192
6424591,2,B00KFNF2DM,The idea of documenting the connections between the two world wars is good. It was interesting to see WW2 leaders as they were in WW1. However there were so many inaccuracies in the WW2 episode that I have trouble buying anything it says it all. MacArthur was not a 5 star in WW2. Patton was not brought back to the front for the Battle of the Bulge. He did not win the Italy campaign - in fact he wasn't even in it. That was Clark.

Doubtless some will gain a better knowledge and/or understanding of these events in the context of this presentation.  And it's not as bad as an Oliver Stone recasting of reality.  On the other hand, is it too much to expect the History Channel to provide an accurate presentation - or at least some acknowledgement that certain events/flow have been presented with a certain ""latitude"" with respect to the actual reality?

6424595,1,B00KFNF2DM,"Although some of this series is very interesting and worth viewing, telling the story of WWI and WWII in such a short amount of time is totally ridiculous and impossible. Many important facts are left out. Additionally the technical errors are so drastic that one cannot believe anything. Nothing is mentioned as to the fact that the Japanese at the end of World War I were awarded German island possessions in the Pacific such as the Marshall's and the Mariana's, on which thousands of Americans would die in World War II. The Japanese only joined the Allies in World War I to get these territories on their way to controlling the Pacific.

Take the part concerning the Battle of Britain. There are gunsight camera views from British planes shooting down German four-engined bombers but the only German four-engined bomber, the Focke-Wulf Condor was hardly ever used over England. So this footage shows U.S. B-17's being attacked by German planes, which has nothing to do with the Battle of Britain. Then there is a view from a German plane bombing England, but it is actually a Japanese plane bombing Pearl Harbor. Finally as the German bombers retreat they are actually American B-17 four-engined Flying Fortresses. All of the Japanese ships I viewed were modern present-day Japanese warships complete with helicopter hangers and radar domes, which at least should have been made black instead of glaring white. And on and on -- a really disgusting portrayal of what was.

And what of General Eisenhower and Bradley and Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Halsey and the U.S. Submarine Service. Amongst the other important not covered at all is the Home Front and production of weapons in the United States, the Battle of the Atlantic, the Resistance movements in occupied countries. Not a mention, not a view. This series should have been, at a minimum have been one week on WWI and the origin of WWII, and then two weeks on WWII.",1401494400,14,1925,4.883792048929664
6424596,3,B00KFNF2DM,"I was quite disappointed in this 3 pt series. Some of the battle re-enactments were done pretty good, but some of the facts they presented were totally ridiculous. Like in the pt 1, the disaster at Gallipoli. Narrator Jeremy Renner, said that the Germans stopped the British at Gallipoli. Wrong. It was the Turks, not the Germans. True, they were German allies, but still Turks. There were many other wrong facts, but in pt 3,there were key ones. FDR did not direct the Battle of Midway from the White House. He probably received hourly reports, but it was Naval HQ in Hawaii that directed the action. And when Patton slapped that soldier, it was not FDR who suspended him. It was Eisenhower, probably on orders from Chief Of Staff, Gen George Marshall. I'm quite sure, Pres. Roosevelt was quite aware of the incident, but I'm also positive that he allowed his military commanders to run their commands as they saw fit. Instead, they made it look like FDR personally ran the American war effort much like Hitler and Stalin ran theirs. And speaking of Eisenhower, hardly any mention of him at all. He was commander in chief of the European theater. Also said repeatedly how Tojo was loyal to Emperor Hirohito. Right. Only when it suited him. Tojo was only loyal to one thing and that was running Japans war effort. He and the rest of the Japanese military only told the Emperor what they wanted him to know and kept him in the dark on many things. In fact the military was ready to overthrow him near the end when they thought he was considering surrendering to the Allies. History Channel dropped the ball on this one. They had something good and spoiled it with their silly version of history.",1401494400,21,1694,4.631229235880399
6424597,3,B00KFNF2DM,"After watching the History Channels much anticipated three-night miniseries The World Wars and array of thoughts emerge.  For the span of time in which the two world wars occurred, the show emphasizes that the Great War and Second World War in Europe and the Pacific from 1914 to 1945, roughly ran 30 years; includes the interwar activities and the build up of the conflicts that would arise by 1939 as a part of the stretch of time.  The show contained much attraction and material for any viewer to be enticed to watch.  And for history buffs, learners, readers, and teachers of the events of the past, especially particular areas of the Second World War, one major and interesting observation of the unique format of the program, a blend of documentary, recreation, and re-enactment, the show displayed the key leaders of the two wars as larger than life and iconic in stature - Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, General George Patton, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt; each in physical appearance in every segment and scene of the show displayed these individuals much like the recent movies recreating superheroes and villains, i.e. G.I. Joe, Captain America, and the Avengers.

However, there appeared an imbalance of the representation or mention of other essential leaders from each of the two theatres of the war, western or eastern, Generals Douglas MacArthur, Emperor Hirohito, Hideki Tojo, Dwight D. Eisenhower, George Marshall, and Admirals Chester Nimitz and William Halsey and Isoroku Yamamoto, and how the eastern front, especially during World War I and World War II may not have been equally represented in scope as the European front; the first world war conflict did stretch across geographical boundaries and impacted colonies in Asia and the Pacific as well and participants and volunteers.  There was indeed much conflict in the Pacific Ocean and the southern most corridors of islands that took more than two years to deter the Japanese imperial military forces by way of strenuous campaigns and unwelcome weather conditions and climates overlooked in the show.  What happened after Midway and Guadalcanal and what happened in the Philippines for forces to eventually move into Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and the fateful days of August 6 and 9, 1945?

Beyond the appearance of the leaders that encountered the world on their shoulders, with many film recreations of the first and second world wars, there is bound to be something missing amidst the tremendous pieces of the puzzle of historical events.  One can discuss and debate of the would and could have been, but importantly, this part of history is once again being retold so not to be forgotten by new generations and to learn from these pivotal events.",1401494400,41,2762,5.095132743362832

The narration asserts that Roosevelt ordered the Allied invasion of Sicily from far that Stalin rather than Hitler would control Europe.  What happened to the North African campaign?  Why then was the USA supplying Stalin with equipment? Stalin in fact was pleading with the allies to open a second front. Later the narrator says that in Stalingrad the Russians had a secret weapon - the infamous Russian winter, and troops from Siberia, well acclimated to winter fighting.  True - but more so for battle of Moscow which antedated the battle of Stalingrad.  Minor errors can be seen in some of the dramatizations: Hitler's armband with two black stripes is an SS armband, not used by Hitler; an SS officer carries a cap with Wehrmacht insignia; a Kriegsmarine flag over a concentration camp, Hitler committed suicide sitting on a sofa in his quarters in the bunker, not in an office in uniform.  More irritating is the pointless babble from politicians: former Vice-president Dick Cheney, former Secretary of  Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and former Senator Joe Lieberman.  None of the commentaries, not even from noted Third Reich historian Sir Richard Evans, was necessary.  His knowledge and expertise should have been consulted in the basic planning of what topics should have been covered and to correct the inaccuracies.  It's a shame.",1401494400,7,1699,5.2555555555555555
6424599,4,B00KFNF2DM,"I disagree from the other two reviews here. This miniseries is an excellent overview - and that's the key word - OVERVIEW. I'm sure the intended audience are the general, non-expert, people. If you say it was inaccurate because there were green fields instead of dead grasses or train tracks instead of dust, then you don't have to see this show, but don't trash it because it is an exemplary piece of journalism. All the actors resembled their historical counterparts, the actual reasons for the wars were presented correctly, and the commentaries were given by an international cast of authorities - not only American, but British, German, Japanese, etc. So it clearly is not a detailed historical thesis, but it is a great, entertaining, and enjoyable way to learn about your own and the world history.",1401494400,65,805,4.926470588235294

6424601,2,B00KFNF2DM,"Like others, I was really looking forward to this, but wound up sorely disappointed.  While the narrative was mostly accurate, albeit very cursory, many of the details were not.  For instance, without explicitly saying so, it implied that Patton was brought back into the war during the Battle of the Bulge to save the day (fact is he had already marched almost to Germany when he was tasked with pulling his division out of it current position and forced marched to relieve Bastogne).  Likewise scenes purporting to show the same battle were in sunny green fields rather than the bitter cold and snow which is the reality.  Still other extremely important personalities were, for the most part, left out - Montgomery comes to mind right away.  I certainly understand that the focus of the mini-series was to give some idea of what the major players were thinking and how they reacted, but the liberties taken with the supporting facts and scenes left a whole lot to be desired.",1401494400,5,978,4.7976190476190474
6424602,1,B00KFNF2DM,"I guess I was thinking that something called ""The History Channel"" would at least make an effort to get details correct, but that seems to have been far too much to expect. From the channel that brings us such intellectual fare as ""Ancient Aliens"" and ""Ice Road Truckers"" comes an over-ambitious and under-researched summary of the most important decades of the 20th century filled with mistakes and omissions. They run the gamut from little things like Gen. MacArthur having 5 stars on his collar in the 30's and German soldiers using English rifles, and showing B-17s and P-51s when discussing the Battle of Britain, to setting the Beer Hall Putsch & march through the streets in what appears to be an unused railway station and implying that it was FDR who planned the battle of Midway. Omissions include not even mentioning such minor characters as Generals Eisenhower, Montgomery and Rommel and Admirals Nimitz and Halsey as well as things like the Soviet invasion of Finland, and pretty much the bulk of the Pacific theater aside from the Philippines.

There are a plethora of others, far too many to recount, but they simply show that the producers were far more concerned with the ""look"" than the ""facts"". The problem is almost all of these could have been corrected with a modicum of effort, but that was, apparently, not in the budget after paying someone like Donald Rumsfeld to give his ""expert"" opinion on Hitler. I am also sure the ghost of FDR will rest easier knowing that Dick Cheney spoke glowingly of his leadership during the crisis.",1401494400,17,1553,4.838345864661654
6424603,1,B00KFNF2DM,"I approached this highly promoted series with eager anticipation but ended watching it with disappointment and even disgust. If what's told here is all you know about WWII, you'd think that Gen. Patton single- handedly won the war in Europe and Gen. MacArthur did the same in the Pacific. Most astonishing, and shameful is the fact that Gen. Dwight Eisenhower is never mentioned! This is distorted, superficial history with all the depth of a comic book. There is a need for a concise, popularized visual history of these wars that shaped the world we live in, but this is not it.",1401494400,31,580,4.752475247524752

8658192,2,B00KFNF2DM,"I found the documentary to be fair, not good. The Cliff Notes variety of History - describing a period of 30+ years in only 3 parts on 2 discs. It doesn't go into detail of any particular point. To me the last one felt rushed to wrap it all up from about the middle on. It does give a visual representation of the leaders of this period and what the wars were about, along with commentary from various contemporary leaders, historians, & authors. Had they done this in say, a six or seven part series, and therefore had more time I would have gotten more actual history from it. I cant give it 3 stars, 2.4",1530921600,,606,4.232758620689655

8658198,2,B00KFNF2DM,"Pros - This is well acted and well produced.
Cons - This is a quick and dirty explanation of the war. VERY Quick and VERY Dirty.  You would have to be Completely Ignorant about WWII to enjoy this. It is a waste of money...any amount of money.
This production company have, simply, cashed in on the current Interest/Infatuation with WWII that was caused (in part) by Private Ryan and Band Of Brothers.
This is a  (Yellow and Black book)  WII for Dummies.
If you want to learn about the war, start with The World At War series from the 1970's. Then watch whatever videos are free on Youtube.
If you still have interest, follow some of the WWII Geeks on the internet that live and breath the war. Most have a decent Youtube channel as well.

I never have heads drop, the kids always look forward to watching hit. The first two episodes have some really good hooks at the beginning that really get their attention. The filmography and narration are excellent. My students want History Channel to do a similar series for the Cold War. I have had other teachers ask to borrow my set to show their students, and some students come in at lunch just to watch it again.",1522454400,3,573,4.364485981308412
