5860232,5,B00DW5IKNO,"Very good movie, real it was a bit over the top but makes you think about these mega churches. It appear that Greenleaf (the new series on OWN) might be a spin off to this movie.",1468540800,,178,3.9722222222222223

5860237,5,B00DW5IKNO,One of the best films on what goes on behind the scenes in some churches. Only recommended for the spiritually mature.,1462233600,,118,4.666666666666667
5860238,1,B00DW5IKNO,IT WOULD NOT PLAY!!!,1462060800,,20,4.25
5860239,5,B00DW5IKNO,"I have not received the movie yet, but I did see it on television.  This movie hit home for many.  I grew up in the church as many of us did.  We were the 60's kids......when there was a time when life was much more civil back then, than it is today.  Many things have changed, people, holidays, events.........we are now in a world based on $$$.  Back then, morals and values reigned supreme, money was secondary, as we all looked out for each other.  Today all we look out for is #1....ourselves. .  This movie shows exactly what has happened with quite a few churches over the course of time.  Corruption, greed, adultery, blackmail, phoniness..........not what God is about.  When actors make movies like this, it doesn't always set well with the public because the truth hurts.  This is not just happening in black churches, it is happening all over, in one way or another.....it just so happens to be done by a stellar black cast, which to America, depicts the downfall of black churches.  Isiah Washington gave the performance of his career as an arrogant, obnoxious greedy, pompous Minister.  I didn't even recognize Lou Gosset Jr...........that's how much they put into their characters.  Elise Neal, as always was on the money.  My man, Clifton Powell never seems to get the credit he deserves as an actor, also put in a phenomenal performance as a Minister on the brink of losing his Christianity due to attacks on his person.  Malinda, Vanessa Bell, Lawman,  the undisputed Keith David, and Bill Cobbs were just great. I was stunned at this movie, but also smiled that the truth made itself known.  A must see for everybody..You will be rivited to your seat ........if the phone rings during viewing, let it ring.  You can't afford to miss a second of this 5 star movie.",1459900800,4,1782,4.67524115755627
5860240,5,B00DW5IKNO,This can happen in any church. The love of money (and power) is the root of all evil.,1459728000,,85,3.7777777777777777
5860251,5,B00DW5IKNO,"Well written and great actors, what's funny is that everything in this film has happened and is still happening in the church and not just black churches. I would have liked to see the church move past the tragic demise of the Pastor but well written overall.",1458777600,,259,4.531914893617022

5860285,5,B00DW5IKNO,"Great account of what can happen to Pastors, leaders and their wives.  Families are being destroyed by these acts of infidelity and greed.  Much prayer is needed.

5860307,5,B00DW5IKNO,"Great movie!! Isaiah Washington deserves an award for his performance (though you will, at minimum, thoroughly dislike his character). WARNING:  you will want to hit/punch/slap/choke ""Pastor LC'. as he completely destroys the holiness of the position he holds. Very thankful that my own Pastor (and First Lady) are POLAR OPPOSITES of ""Pastor LC"". Isaiah's character is the epitome of pride, selfishness, greed and hypocrisy.",1439510400,,424,5.625

5860311,3,B00DW5IKNO,"I have been in churches many years and though these things can happen, because Pastors are human just like the congregation under them is, I thought it was a bit extreme in regards to the Pastor that was cheating and verbally abusive.  But I guess a more moderate depiction of the human error of pastors would not sell the movie.",1436832000,,329,4.483333333333333

5860337,5,B00DW5IKNO,"WOW, honest take on how Christians sometimes they really need more conversion in their hearts, than just singing in church and praising God.

Unfortunately, most churches in America are very corrupt, and it doesn't matter if it is a black churches, a white churches, or an interracial churches.  This movie shows a realistic view of what going behind the pulpit only to gain money, power, sometimes fame.  In addition, most Christians go to church to get spoon-fed by their pastors.  In other words, they don't take the time to study the bible for themselves to test if what the pastors say is in-line w/ the Word of God.  So sad!!!",1404432000,,622,4.526785714285714

5860472,5,B00DW5IKNO,"This is an extraordinary film. Isaiah Washington is truly, and unequivocally, brilliant. The entire cast was amazing: that I ceased looking at them as 'Actor X from Y show' and became sucked into their Undershepherd performance & character speaks volumes. The story is amazing and was perfectly executed. I was absolutely glued to the screen and in shock at some of the scenes! Isaiah played the devil so well and the supporting cast did a great job of attempting to dodge, and later, bring down the devil. It is a travesty that this film was not more widely distributed -- smart film, timely subject matter, great cast and soooo entertaining!",1397347200,,643,4.8545454545454545

5860478,4,B00DW5IKNO,"I'm big into the black American movie genre. I hesitated on this one as the whole church theme kinda threw me off. This movie was one of the best I've seen. Isaiah Washington did his thing. Kinda like Eddie Kane on the pulpit. This movie wasn't churchy (inspirational) it was edgy and did a good job keeping you involved. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I have to hold on to something, don't I.",1395878400,,411,4.282051282051282

5860480,5,B00DW5IKNO,"The truth be told in some churches abuse does occur.  The story needs to be told because God's People are being wounded.  There are those who have left church but not God because of that hurt and pain.  Russ Parr has exposed the evil of church abuse in Undershepherd and I applaud him for his boldness.  Abuse in the church does not need to be swept under the rug.  Abuse can trigger violence so we need to pray for the victims and abusers.

God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time (appointed) for every matter and purpose and for every work.  Ecclesiastes 3:17 (Amplified Bible)",1395792000,3,604,4.4363636363636365

5860482,5,B00DW5IKNO,Love this movie. Purchased it as a gift for a friend. Makes one take a second look at just how the modern day  church can really be corrupt with those professing to be prophets/ spiritual leaders being extremely deceptive.,1395619200,,222,4.6923076923076925
5860503,5,B00DW5IKNO,"A good movie with an ungodly desire that should not be in or allowed in the church things that are known and are not yet known, But will some day come to the light sooner or later. This move sheds light on few things but when ungodliness get its way. Woe",1395532800,,254,4.0
5860504,5,B00DW5IKNO,"This is a very good movie, Isaiah Washington played his character well.  I hope there is no church like that, it was a bit extreme for a church. But it is a movie and it told a story. I caught myself talking to the character of Isaiah Washington. So it got it's point across. I watched  this movie 3 times.",1395273600,,306,4.083333333333333

5860506,4,B00DW5IKNO,"First of all, I understand this is a low budget movie and some of the characters are over the top. Nevertheless, I didn't take my eyes off the screen from beginning to end. What makes this so engrossing is not only the story, but that the movie is filled with known actors that worked with enough talent to really draw you in.

Two young Baptist ministers have been waiting over 15 years to ""move up"" in the church, and the current aged and ailing pastor isn't going anywhere. One decides to part ways, and he and his wife open a little storefront church. They are struggling, but truly do love God and each other. The other young minister leads a ""coup"" against the church leadership and over a period of time pretty much just slides his way into the pastor's chair. Isiah Washington in this role is just plain scary, ruthless and charming at the same time. His beautiful wife is a complete wreck, but gallantly hangs in there as ""first lady,"" to this nut, as least until she loses it completely.

This is not a stage play, or musical. If you are even mildly into ""gospel movies"" and even if you're not, this is a must see.",1394928000,,1124,4.399038461538462
5860507,5,B00DW5IKNO,it was very good movie and that do realy happens in real life and the pastor was a HOT MESS,1394582400,,91,3.6
5860508,3,B00DW5IKNO,Good Movie about the human part of the Black Church. A preacher wanted to sound good without applying what he preached.,1394236800,,119,4.714285714285714
5860509,3,B00DW5IKNO,There is some truth to the movie and some that to me was off on how they potrayed the church,1393977600,,92,3.65

However I expected more emphasis on how the church went on , how the body regained trust etc.",1393891200,,271,4.230769230769231
5860511,5,B00DW5IKNO,"Chocked full of drama!! Although some scenes were just totally unrealistic, but i guess this is what keeps you watching. It shows how anyone can fall into the clutches of power, lust and money even a pastor. This pastor was totally a out of control and so abusive.",1393804800,,264,4.520833333333333

5860534,5,B00DW5IKNO,It's been a long time since I've seen a good movie.  This movie was amazing.  I was angry and screaming at the screen.  Isaiah Washington was great and I hated his character.  I wanted him to pay in another way other than jail but the story line was great and so were the actors/actresses.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  It's a must see and I am recommending this movie to friends and family and I will be purchasing it.,1393027200,,423,4.097560975609756

5860578,4,B00DW5IKNO,"Great story, good story line.  There is a lot to be said in control and manipulation, of which you can see in the church; ego and pride are the opposite of Godly attributes and the preacher in this story was anything but godly.

5860581,5,B00DW5IKNO,"Because the monster was the pastor.  Isaiah Washington was off the charts as one of two pastors vieing to take over a chuch, now that the current pastor is retiring.  Isaiah is pulling out all stop and stooping to whatever level he need to drop to, just to obtain that position.  Berating his wife and sleeping with his mistress....well, everybody needs some filler time.  Ruthless, unrelenting and just plain nasty, Isaiah pulls out all the ratchet tricks to get what he wants. This is a movie that gives the black churches a black eye, while looking at your pastor closely.  I saw this movie on T.V. some time ago, and, I'm sure, I will never forget it.  To all involved...BRAVO!!!!",1389657600,,684,4.658333333333333

5860603,4,B00DW5IKNO,I was wondering when someone would make a movie about what really happens in some ofour Black churches.  Notice I did say some. Many people are hurt and lost today because of shenanigans like this that happen every week in the black church.  I felt Isaiah Washington's character could have been more knowledgeable of the word.  When the wolf comes in sheep clothing he knows the word.,1388880000,5,384,4.701492537313433

This is one of the few Non-mass released in theaters church movies that I enjoyed, besides the movie WOLF that dealt with Clergy Sexual Abuse in the black church.

She and her church going sisters loved it too! Isaiah Washington and the cast of this movie did a phenomenal job making this movie believable. I loaned it to a co-worker to watch and she thought it was based on a true story. I don't believe so and think it was the ""fake"" documentary style of the movie's opening and closing. If you like church drama, this movie does not disappoint. The things that happen in this movie happen in real life in some churches today!",1387584000,,599,4.172413793103448
5860637,3,B00DW5IKNO,Before renting this movie I read the reviews and watched the trailer. I knew it was very controversial and being a victim of church hurt myself I was very conflicted on whether I should actually watch this movie. Yet I was still very intrigued by the movie because of my a ability to somewhat relate to parts of the story having been a member an Arican American church. I preceded to rent it  also because of my great fondness for the actor's that are in this movie. Upon completion I can honestly say I have sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. We all know that there is corruption in the Church but I can not say that God got the glory out of this project. I don't feel we needed to see foul acts that supposedly depict an Afircan American Church played out on film. Yes the moral of the  story is what you do in m the dark will come out in the light. But my fear is that those who don't understand or know how to interrupt the message will be pushed away from the Church for fear of encountering a similar experience. It is my wish and prayer that if you do proceed to watch the film you will keep in mind this is strictly for entertainment value only.,1387411200,4,1157,4.160714285714286

In These days and perilous times you're better off not having a pastor but still study Gods word for yourself daily. I would not sit under a false prophet as my leader. Preachers should have love and compassion for people, not arrogance and control. Some preachers today do not have the ""fruits of the spirit"".

5860669,4,B00DW5IKNO,"This movie details the negative aspects of church life. Focusing on the top deadly sins that man can commit the movie pours with evil intent for power and acceptance.

Make sure to have some popcorn available because it's going to be one hell of a story line.",1385683200,,259,4.51063829787234

5860672,5,B00DW5IKNO,"this is ripped from the headlines, must see tv.  Anyone who has been truly involved in the church knows this story on some level.  The  acting was stellar. It was a the level that things that I may have noticed in a similarly budgeted movie.  I know that many will say this movie takes light away from the Kingdom but I say we live in the last days and we need to be mindful.",1385078400,,375,4.027027027027027

5860700,3,B00DW5IKNO,For the effort put forth and the great cast of talent. I'm still wondering if this was based on a true story because of the narration before and after.,1384387200,,151,4.241379310344827
5860701,5,B00DW5IKNO,"This was a great movie, full of action and unbelief about how some churches are being used as a business instead of a place for help, healing and a house of worship.",1384300800,7,165,4.1875

5860704,5,B00DW5IKNO,This movie is superb.  Highly recommend Pastors to share this with their members.  This movie actually covers events that happens in the church today!,1384300800,,150,5.208333333333333
5860705,4,B00DW5IKNO,"This was a good movie. The direction, acting and story were good. I liked the look behind the curtain of the church and it's leaders. It shows the corruption of church leaders as well as the sincerity of the pastors who are genuine. Isaiah Washington was superb. He made the movie. The entire cast had to match his intensity. Recommended for fans of African American films. This would be rated PG-13 for mature themes.",1384214400,,418,4.662162162162162
5860706,4,B00DW5IKNO,"I have served as a Church administrator for many years at various churches.  This movie is quite accurate.  I have worked with ministers who straddled the fence and I have sat with board members who truly lacked integrity.  It was refreshing so see at the end that those things that the ""Pastor"" did in the dark were brought to light.  As the Bible says, ""Be careful how you stand, lest ye fall.""",1384128000,10,396,4.458333333333333

5860733,5,B00DW5IKNO,"The movie was great, there were a lot of life lessons to learn. It is also a lesson to learn that every christian do not really know the lord.",1382918400,,142,3.9310344827586206
5860734,3,B00DW5IKNO,It was sad to watch this movie.  Mixed feelings about this one.  We know that there are wolves in sheep's clothing.  Do we need to see this on film?  Does God get any glory?,1382832000,,173,4.0

5860736,4,B00DW5IKNO,"My husband was doubtful since we had never heard of this movie but we were so glad we watched. def a good movie worth watching. With good acting and enough unpredictability, it does a good job of raising some issues that we are all aware of and that are worth thinking about. Didnt think it was over dramatic at all, it is a MOVIE after all.",1382054400,,341,4.181818181818182

5860758,3,B00DW5IKNO,"I understand that movies have a limited time to develop and depict a plot or story line and the need to dramatize certain events. However, this movie was far too overweight in drama and far too little developed in the story line.  By overly dramatizing the negative depiction of the main character, much of the character development of the associate characters was neglected.  All in all, this was a story about a typical self-absorbed, egotistical, narcissistic individual that was simply transposed as a minister.",1382054400,4,515,5.119047619047619
5860759,5,B00DW5IKNO,"Saw this movie on cable and it was fantastic.  Just saw it again last week on cable and fell in love with it again.

An arrogant asst. pastor vs a humble pastor..who left a church they were with for 15 yrs, and never moved up. Sr. pastor would not let them preach until he preached himself to death and went down in pulpit. Then board voted sr. pastor and deacon out of the church, and left the two underpastors to preach. The humble one was good and members was loving him when the arrogant one jumped up and pushed him off the podium preaching by overtalking him and embarrassing him and wife. He saw himself taking over and getting rich. then head of church told him of a new church, going nationwide on tv. He got more arrogant, and it grew and he got rich, stuffing $$ in his desk drawer.

It got worse,...It is a must see.  Keep an eye on the UNDERSHEPHERD.

You won't be disappointed in buying or renting this movie.  I like to look at these kinds of movies on Sunday, because there is nothing decent on TV/cable on Sunday, it has gone to hell.

I save all these great decent christian movies and look at them on Sundays and have a really enjoyable and spiritual day.

A MUST SEE.",1381881600,,1187,4.267857142857143
