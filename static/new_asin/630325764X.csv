628684,3,630325764X,"Hammer films reached back into Greek mythology and pulled the Medusa myth into a 19th century setting.  This film is suspenceful and as visually satisfying as a Hammer film can be.  Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing  switch their normal good and evil roles for this film. Cushing's cold  manner is very good, as is Barbara Shelley's role as a distraught woman  looking to flee the small village she lives in.  The sets and the title  creature both add to mood of the film, although the close-ups of the  monster are less effective.  This is one of Hammer's best non-Dracula  films.",943401600,8,581,4.72

Actually it came across as a spooky drama and only the Medusa (aka, Megaera) head fell short.
For a 1964 horror film the rubber snakes were not as bad as some B Sci-Fi movie monsters.
There is no making featurette, but the DVD does have a movie trailer, and included in the DVD box was nice booklet about The Gorgon and Hammer Films with background info and pictures!
The DVD itself has the UK region issue and does require a multi-zone multiple region capable DVD player.

The Gorgon - Rock Solid Performance!

Directed by Terence Fisher, the same guy who directed Brides of Dracula and Curse of the Werewolf, presents Gorgon.

Interesting, if a bit convoluted plot.  The scene opens with words of caution regarding the nameless horror from ancient times, etc. ,etc., similar to the earlier films mentioned.

Then we appear at an artist's house who sketches a half-nude brunette.  So far so salacious.  The artist turns out to be Bruno, the son of a famous professor of those parts.  The girl turns out to nag him about marrying her but she's ashamed.  Bruno asks why and she admits to pregnancy.

He runs from the house through the woods (which have been found six stoned bodies (no, not drugs, actual stone statues, over the last five years) to see her father to tell him (chivalry is not dead, eh?).  She runs after him.

Wait, full moon, on cue.  Girl, through woods, alone.  Boyfriend dead.  Girl screams!!

We cut to a sanitarium, run by Professor Namaroff, expertly played by Peter Cushing, assisted by his sexy redheaded nurse/secretary.

As the story continues, they find the girl, roll her into the lab and find she's a stone statue.  Scream.

We meet the son of Bruno, who comes to the inquest to learn that they have branded his son a murderer and suicide (he was found dangling from a tree, quite bloodied).

The story moves from there:  the professor confronting Peter Cushing's character to find out more information, being stopped at every turn in his investigation, even the police won't help him as the townsfolk attempt to beat him up and burn his house.  The police want to escort him out.

Lots of twists and turns.  He writes telegrams and eventually we get to meet his other son and a third professor ""from Leipzig University"" in the form of Christopher Lee, a gray-haired, large mustached man.

Interesting, provocative scenes of the woods, the strange music, the meeting with the Gorgon who at a glance can turn one to stone.  The walk through the woods leads to a marble courtyard, made eerie by the soft blowing wind, the leaves swirling about, the darkness and the clouds over the constantly full moon.  Always seems full for some reason.

Our professor gets an eyeful of the Gorgon in the castle, runs screaming.  Oh boy. ....  As he begins his gray slide to mineral life, he writes a letter to his son as one of his last acts.  The acting here is pretty good -- though I expected a bit more regret or sorrow that this was to be his last act.

Peter Cushing's character continues to cover up the fact that the professor died from turning to stone just like he did about the girl.  He lies about their affliction for as yet no apparent reason.  The professor's son comes and confronts him but it's all the same.

Stone silence.  (Sorry, couldn't resist.)

As expected, the son (Paul Heitz) also has a run-in with the Gorgon sister and ends up on bed almost a week.  Meantime, the assistant, Carla Hoffman, makes friendly with Paul but is actually spying for Peter Cushing's character ,whom she loves.

A bit convoluted, eh?  When does Christopher Lee arrive?

Paul leaves the institution but clearly Peter Cushing's character is covering up something.  And we discover something about Carla -- she's afraid, she seems to love both guys and she has some secret that prevents her from leaving.  Oh brother.

Overall, great move, great cast.  The film plods along in certain places and seems to love to show itself off rather than move the plot along.  It's  very pretty film, but moves a bit slow for my taste.

Kudos to Lee for the fierce English professorial performance and to Cushing who, unusually, plays an intelligent but frightened man who is covering up something evil.

628761,5,630325764X,"Now this is what I'm all about.  Give me the old Hammer classics ANYtime.  This was a great tale of terror from 1964, starring Peter Cushing, and Christpher Lee.  A tiny village in turn-of-the-century Bavaria, or Germany, etc,(wasn't it always?)is terrorized by series of murders where all the victims are turned to stone! Back in those days you rarely saw the monster until the end, and I thought this always made the film more suspenseful. I love the backrounds,sets, and lighting in these old 60's British horror flicks. They always give me fond memories of being a kid, watching my favorite Saturday night horror show, under my blanket, with some popcorn, and the lights turned off. Good times, and a great movie!  I know there's other stuff that might be better out there, but to me the old greats like Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and of course, Vincent Price, will always be dearest to my heart.",1208304000,7,905,4.782051282051282

628843,5,630325764X,"Terrence Fisher has brought to the screen a story of doomed love and a schizoid protaganist that places thematic themes from Hichcock's ""Vertigo"" within a Grimm's fairy tale for adults.

Those who tiresomely belabor the inadequacy of the snakes on the Gorgon's head at the film's conclusion entirely miss the point. It is not surprising in our cretinous era that some would lament the unavailability of computer generated special effects in 1964. That they persist in doing so, however, only serves to illustrate how very far these modernists are in both sensibility and aesthetic principles from the 19th century Gothic tradition that this film so faithfully seeks to reproduce. The point isn't the snakes but the psychological force behind the baleful facial expression!

In this connection, it is appropriate to observe that Terence Fisher was absolutely right in considering this one of his best films.

And make no mistake: this film is very much in the 19th century Gothic tradition in both story and atmosphere. In that sense, it may be compared to a story by Ludwig Tieck, while its visuals hearken back to the paintings of Jacob van Ruisdael.

Visually, it is among Hammer's most accomplished productions. Michael Reed's effective photographic renderings include: a nocturnal cemetery festooned with fluttering autumnal leaves, the viscerally chilly, fog and frost bitten ravine (you can almost watch your own breath smoke in merely watching it) where a hanged man is discovered, the vast shadowed Castle Borski depicted under a full moon with scudding clouds, to name but a few. Indeed, the cinematography and particularly the lighting are amongst Hammer's best.

And Mr. Reed is ably abetted by production designer Bernard Robinson whose key piece in this film: the deserted inside of the self-same Castle Borski is a marvel of tattered armorial flags, dust laden furniture, and sinister mirrors. The musical score is also one of Hammer's best and most effectively understated.

But the film belongs to the incomparably lovely Barbara Shelley's ""Carla Hoffman""--she of the sweeping pelisse seated on a gilded throne in the deserted castle. It is to be hoped that someday this accomplished beauty will receive all the retrospective attention surely due her. For now, suffice it to say, that few actresses in the history of cinema have constructed a portrayal so wholly and precariously based on an enigma, an enigma Miss Shelley consistently reveals in every gesture, expression and nuance, without allowing her character, ""Carla"" the possibility of even understanding it herself.

It isn't merely that her Carla is fatally charming and alluring, but decent and humanitarian as well, a victim, to be sure, but not at all in the degraded, naturalistic way that Jean Seberg's portrayal is in ""Lilith"" a film to which ""The Gorgon"" is frequently compared.

Much can always be found to admire in anything Miss Shelley does. For now let us just close with a passing note on her deportment, the absolute self control she exercises in her throaty, perfectly modulated voice and carriage. Would that actresses today would study her technique !!!!!!!!!!!

Watch her in her first confrontation scene with Peter Cushing in his parlor, where she accuses him of stonewalling during the inquest, just prior to the entrance of Paul's father--Professor Heinz. Merely observing her majestically exit the room after being introduced to the Professor is worth the whole price of admission!",1147910400,26,3479,5.220430107526882
628844,4,630325764X,"Hammer's 1964 The Gorgon is crying out for a DVD widescreen release on both sides of the Atlantic. This underrated film is a mesmerizing fantasy that brings together ancient mythology and Hammer's best gothic style under the expert direction of stalwart Terence Fisher.

Production looks great, even if it is unfortunately studiobound. The film has a definite fairy-tale-like quality to it, confirming Fisher's reputation as a maker of ""fairy tales for adults"".

Lee is a tad uncomfortable in a fairly untypical role here, but Cushing excels as the ambiguous anti-hero Dr Namaroff. Michael Reed lights and photographs the production beautifully and with great atmosphere, lending Hammer some of its most poignant moments.",1099785600,10,721,5.428571428571429

This is a rather mediocre effort which is intermittently elevated by some good set construction (creepy, fogbound forests and deserted ruins never fail to provide a pleasantly spooky atmosphere) and reliable performances by Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, who have reversed their usual roles.  Here, Lee plays a hero and Cushing is a villainous doctor who tries to hide the existence of the monster and frame an innocent for the murders.

628847,4,630325764X,"Hammer reunited their big three of actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee along with director Terrence Fisher for the first time since ""The Mummy"" for the 1964 film ""The Gorgon.""  Having seen success providing their own twists on Universal's classic monster, Hammer was obviously going for something original.  Our story begins with the death of a beautiful artist's model who is found petrified, the seventh victim turned to stone in the last five years.  The local physician, Dr. Namaroff (Cushing) convinces the police to pin the murder on the girl's lover, artist Bruno Heitz, who was found hung.  When his father, Professor Heitz (Michael Goodliffe) arrives to investigate he encounters a strange crature in the shadows.  Turning to stone, the Professor manages to scrawl a note before the process is complete.  The Professor's other son Paul (Richard Pasco) now arrives upon the scene, learns of his father's death, reads the note and concludes that the killer is in fact Magera, one of the Gorgons of classical mythology (title gives it away, right?).  Namaroff sends his assistant Carla Hoffman (Barbara Steele) to spy on Paul, but the two fall in love.  When Professor Meister (Lee) arrives to help Paul, he connects the dots and figures out Magera has been possessing Carla and that Namaroff is hiding this horrible secret.  We then proceed to the unhappy ending.
Obviously the makeup job on the Gorgon (played by Prudence Hyman instead of Steele) leaves a lot to be desire, even given that we are talking about Hammer Studios in the Sixties.  One of nice things about this film constitutes something of a role reversal for Cushing and Lee (I am trying to remember another film where Christopher Lee gets to play the hero).  Both Steele and Pasco turn in what is arguably the best performances of the love interests in a Hammer film, but the love story is hampered somewhat by the script, written by John Gilling but heavily revised by Anthony Hinds.  Still, when all is said and done, I think ""The Gorgon"" is an above-average effort from Hammer.",991612800,2,2058,4.916184971098266
628848,5,630325764X,"I've read the other reviews, and I have no intention of looking for the philosophical undertones nor an homage to other directors. Fisher is famous for creating scenarios that scare the pants off his audience, and this is no different. Indeed, the haunting mood and unusual plot can really keep one on the edge of one's seat. Cushing, Lee and good looking lovers and creepy monsters all add up to a scary ball of fun that shouldn't be missed. A creepy and entertaining film; see it soon! UPDATE: Hammer Films (or someone) had the wisdom to release a Collection which includes this, ""Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"", ""Scream of Fear"" and ""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"". It's on 2 discs and the transfers are excellent. I recommend it; price is decent.",991526400,,744,4.643939393939394
628849,4,630325764X,"The crucial clue to understanding the work of director Terence Fisher is to note that his directing hero was not one of the 'usual suspects' for a horror director, like Lang or Hitchcock, but Frank Borzage, the 30's director of tender, fragile romances like 'Moonrise' and 'A Farewell To Arms'. And as he grew more confident and independent in his work for Hammer films, Fisher's most personal work smuggled Borzagian romance past his producers in horror guise. Forget the usual critical cliche about his work: that it presents rigidly defined black-and-white battles between Good and Evil. This only applies to a handful of his pictures, usually from the earlier part of his Hammer career. In Fisher's mature work, the lines between good and evil are often more ambiguous than in many of the more modernist horrors that came after him (e.g.'The Exorcist' and 'Halloween'). And his most heartfelt work - 'Curse Of The Werewolf','Phantom Of The Opera','Frankenstein Created Woman'and the film discussed here, is a sequence of tragic love stories. Which brings us to 'The Gorgon', one of the most romantic but also the bleakest of these love stories. All the key characters in the film are driven by the most desperate love: the pregnant Sascha in the opening scenes, Professor Heitz mourning and defending a lost son, Carla and Paul in their foredoomed affair, Namaroff oppressing Carla and torturing himself with the love she can never reciprocate, Ratoff(who might at first seem a token thug)worshipping Carla as devoutly as is master does, even Christopher Lee's celibate Meister has a father's anxious protectiveness towards Paul. But in the bleak world which cameraman Michael Reed depicts throughout in grim blues and greys, there is no reward for such devotion but the stony isolation of death. The film, however, is tragic rather than merely nihilistic, for the characters are haunted throughout by the thought that their love might somehow win them a place in some better world somewhere else. This makes Carla's parting from Paul in the castle scene all the more poignant: haven't we all known a moment such as she knows then, when we face the fact that the door to salvation was open to us as recently as a couple of minutes ago, but we looked away at the wrong moment and the breeze blew it shut? That's why this, like all Fisher's best films, is such a treasurable work. It's not about shock effects, but about the beauty and sadness of being alive. It stands as the bleakest of all Gorgon myths, bleaker by far than the Greek originals, for it portrays a whole world whose fate is to turn to stone.

628850,4,630325764X,"""The Gorgon"" is a curious mixture of elements, as the spirit of the sole surviving gorgon sisters of Greek legend rises again to plague a Balkan village at the dawn of the 20th century. Peter Cushing is featured prominently as the village doctor who is trying to cover up the fact that villagers are being turned to stone under every full moon for mysterious (and possibly sinister) reasons. Christopher Lee and Richard Pasco play scholars devoted to ending the Gorgon's reign of terror.
""The Gorgan"" contains a number of truly chilling moments, with lighting, camera work, and performances by all featured actors being of top quality for Hammer efforts. Yes, there are some plot threads left dangling, and the film loses a little bit of steam toward the end--when the mystery of the Gorgon is all but solved but the story STILL doesn't go to its resolution--but the final confrontation between Cushing, Pasco, Lee, and the Gorgon is one of the most dramatic endings to a Hammer film outside some of the 'Dracula' series.

7844107,3,630325764X,"British film studio Hammer made its reputation in the 1960s as a producer of better than average horror films.  The Gorgon, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, all three veteran horror film stalwarts, retells the story from Greek myth of the snake-haired woman so ugly that anyone who looks directly at her is turned to stone. The most interesting thing about the film is the mise-en-scene:  the story is reset in a supposedly Eastern European village but the environment seems like a cross between Transylvania and Sussex; the interiors and costumes are richly detailed and credible.  The acting is as good as you would expect from Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, with the latter rather atypically playing the good guy rather than a villain.

The film is good enough that it might have been a minor classic of the horror genre, except for one huge flaw.  (Possible spoiler ahead, but if you know the myth at all you will know what happens anyway.) At the end of the film, in what is supposed to be the peak of the horror, when we finally get a closeup of the Gorgon's decapitated head, it is ridiculously obvious that it is the head of a mannequin. It is about as convincing a special effect as you would expect in a movie made by high school students in their garage.

That aside, the rest of the film is good enough to be watchable and will be of interest especially to fans of the horror genre.  It's available in various DVDs; I'm rather arbitrarily attaching this review to one of the Amazon listings of this film only, though I saw it on the Icons of Horror Hammer DVD set, which is of acceptable quality.",1493164800,,1654,4.605442176870748
