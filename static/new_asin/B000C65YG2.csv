8095855,4,B000C65YG2,I thought that this was an interesting mix. I bought it mostly for MUTHERS. I love this film and Jayne Kennedy. The other movies were good too in the genre.,1353542400,2,156,4.233333333333333

8095857,1,B000C65YG2,Ok I knew these would be bad movies but they are virtually unwatchable. I like old B movies and was hoping for one gem in this collection but no such luck. Go with one of the Corman collections instead.,1324425600,,202,4.205128205128205
