7824207,3,6302316030,"Once again in the early going of the first season the writers for 'The Next Generation' revisited some of the themes from episodes of the original series.  This particular show began life as a story titled 'Love Beyond Time And Space'.  Yeah...UGH!!!  I completely agree!  Series contributing writer Tracy Torme was given the undesirable task of providing a script from the original writer's notes and outline.  In an interview Torme said that story's author ""apparently knew very little about science fiction writing and so I did the best with what I had to work with.""  That seems like a flimsy excuse for what is a rather poor outing for the first season.  Series fans will recognize story elements borrowed from 'Amok Time', 'For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched the Sky' and even to a lesser degree 'Elaan Of Troyius' - all episodes from the original series.  While imitation is often considered the highest form of flattery it did get quite monotonous during the first season of ST: TNG.  Eventually the show found its own direction in later episodes, drawing upon the strengths of it's own characters and leaving the 'old' Enterprise and its crew behind.

Coming into orbit around the planet known as Haven Picard remarks aloud about the legendary curative qualities ascribed to it.  Rumors abound that a person need only to spend a short time on the planet's surface to be cured of whatever ills you suffer from.  Their arrival there is coincided by the visit of Troi's mother, Lwaxana, and the young man, Wyatt, whom Deanna was genetically bonded to as a girl - who is accompanied by his parents.  The time has come for Deanna & Wyatt to wed which causes a flurry of ruffled emotions and tension among both sets of in-laws as well as Riker who can't bear to see Troi marry; meanwhile Deanna and Wyatt are each experiencing reluctance about their upcoming nuptials.  Into the same orbit comes a ship carrying the remaining members of the Tarellian race, an alien species that was thought to be extinct.  Centuries earlier the Tarellians had fought a biological war and members of their species died from infection. Attempting to resettle on other planets their presence there infected and killed other planet inhabitants and so the Tarellians became unwelcome in any part of the galaxy.  When contact is established with the Tarellian ship Wyatt comes face-to-face with a woman that he has experienced several visions of for years and realizes his true destiny.

It's about as interesting as it sounds too.  There are some decent comical moments that save the episode from total disaster.  To begin with there is the introduction of Deanna's unbearably gregarious and eccentric mother Lwaxana.  Her first appearance in the series isn't nearly as memorable as her later ones but she's still quite raucous here.  Picard becomes the victim of her controversial and stinging wit throughout providing a few chuckles.  The dinner gathering to celebrate the announcement of Wyatt's & Deanna's marriage provides some of the first season's better moments also.  The in-laws bicker over how the ceremony should be performed leading to up the best line Data had in any of the first handful of these episodes.  After Deanna angrily denounces the in-laws 'petty bickering' and storms out, Data quite innocently asks, ""Could you please continue the petty bickering?  It's most intriguing.""

What doesn't work with 'Haven' though is the entire setup for Wyatt to come into contact with the girl of his visions, the Tarellian Ariana.  It's quite hokey and extremely far-fetched - even for science fiction.  There is an attempt at an explanation when Wyatt says that he thought Deanna was the woman in his visions, knowing that she was a Betazoid and capable of mental telepathy.  But the proceedings are still an absurd coincidence that seems ridiculously improbable.  When Wyatt boards the Tarellian vessel and sees the drawings of him hanging as if in an art gallery it's all too much.  Ariana however (played by Danitza Kingsley) is lovely to look at and it's easy to see how Wyatt could become preoccupied by his visions!  The ""imzadi"" reference between Riker and Troi is further fleshed out here but that also wasn't the most inspiring and well thought-out premise either.  Wisely the word ""imzadi"" would be dropped entirely from the series but the Riker-Troi romance would still flourish in later episodes and the movies as well.",1101945600,,4433,4.955345060893099
7824208,3,6302316030,"When Deanna Troi receives a message from her home planet of Betazoid, she announces to her shocked crewmates that she is to be married by arrangement to a man she was betrothed to as a child. Haven provides the first appearance of the formidable Lwaxana Troi and her silent manservant Mr Homn as they arrive on the Enterprise with Troi's fiance and prospective in-laws. Wyatt Miller, although content at the idea of the marriage, expresses his surprise on meeting his bride: he has been dreaming of a woman he assumed to be Deanna for years. Preparations for the wedding ceremony (which will be performed with all guests totally nude) are under way, when an unknown ship approaches the Enterprise. By a strange twist of fate and very lucky coincidence, the vessel is carrying Ariana, the woman from Wyatt's visions, who has been experiencing similar dreams herself. But Ariana is Tarellian: one of the last survivors of a race thought to have wiped themselves out through biological warfare. These same survivors are now dying yet the planet of Haven refuses them sanctuary, fearing that the plague may spread. Wyatt is know torn between his reluctant fiance and the women of his dreams.
I would rank 'Haven' as a three and a half star episode - a little above average, with some humorous moments courtesy of Lwaxana and the bickering between the in-laws. To be honest, I think this episode would have been better received had it aired a lot later on in TNG's run. At this point in the series, we still didn't know or care much about any of the characters and the whole Riker-Troi Imzadi thing hadn't really been explained. Of course, the relationship did take all of seven seasons and three movies to actually to become official, but it built up a huge following of Imzadi-obsessed relationshippers and became probably the most popular of all the Trek romances. 'Haven' is the first episode that focuses mainly on Troi and if you can ignore the unbelievable-to-the-point-of-stupidity coincidence (destiny maybe?), it's pretty good.",997574400,3,2032,4.927113702623907

Spoiler Alert:
Haven marks a Next Generation first.  The Auntie Mame of the Galaxy turns out to be Troi's mother.  It's unusual to me that such a sophisticated culture would have arranged marriages.  Especially one where the inhabitants have physic powers.  Troi's husband to be; Wyatt, is having visions of another love of his, who turns out to be on a plague ship.  This guy happens to be a medical doctor.  An amazing sci-fi coincidence.
As Data mentioned the ""petty bickering""; between the families make this an entertaining episode. The Wyatt family have nothing in common with Lwaxana Troi, who does a lot of scenery chewing throughout this very humorous episode.",977184000,,696,5.06140350877193
