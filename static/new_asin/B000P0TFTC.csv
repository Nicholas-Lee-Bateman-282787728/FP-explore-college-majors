8188108,3,B000P0TFTC,"This documentary from Coral Ridge Ministries is hosted by D. James Kennedy and Dean Jones. Kennedy's discussion set forth the accepted position of classical Christianity with other church scholars and theologians who supported his position.
While I think it is important to dialog with others; I was personally disappointed with the format of this documentary. The repetitious nature of the objections presented became an irritant in the context of the Coral Ridge position.
The redeeming quality of the project was the positive testimonies of faith in a living Christ.",1318809600,,569,5.404494382022472
