3514622,5,B001CO428O,"A LOT OF GOOD, BASIC INFORMATION, CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE DVD'S INCLUDED IN THE WEIDER SYSTEM. DETAILED INFO ON HOW TO PERFORM THE BASIC MUSCLE EXERCISES CAN BE SEEN IN THESE DVDS (VERBALLY EXPLAINED / PHYSICALLY PERFORMED).  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE ON STEROIDS TO BENEFIT FROM THESE DVD'S.  IT BASICALLY GIVES YOU THE BASICS OF MUSCLE BUILDING.  WHICH REQUIRES HARD WORK.  COMPARED TO TODAY'S STANDARD OF FAD DIETS AND B.S. MUSCLE BUILDING ROUTINES, IT SIMPILY SHOWS THE BASIC BARBELL AND DUMBBELL EXERCISES, AND OTHER BASIC (MACHINE) EXERCISES, WHICH ARE NEEDED TO GAIN BOTH SIZE AND STRENGTH.  AFTER ALL, IT IS THE BASIC, MUSCLE BUILDING EXERCISES, WHICH WILL BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL ADDITIONAL MUSCLE BUILDING GOALS.",1305417600,10,724,5.050420168067227
3514623,1,B001CO428O,"don't buy into the hype.  the weider empire didn't ""invent"" anything except a way to rephrase what exercise and medical science have known for years. (OK, that's too strong a term. Some of their products, such as some of the benches they marketed, were and are as good as any.)  The 'Weider principles' were known and practiced for decades. They got a lot of attention once people combined them with injections of androgenic chemicals, turning themselves into hypertrophic zombies with the potential for a host of health problems from cardiomyopathy to kidney failure to prostate cancer.

Sorry, Arnold, and all the rest of you guys (and women): it's not enough to say things like  ' we didn't know back then that these things were dangerous and anyway they were legal.'  Anyone with half a brain in the health sciences knew these things were deadly. I'll bet you all did, too.

What you get with the high priced Weider system is a chance to keep feeding the beast, a mega-industry based on basic nutrient and hard work principles that you can get for free through a thousand different sources out there, from the American College for Sports Medicine to the National Strength and Conditioning Association.  The Weider stuff has had its day, thank heavens.  Let's get back to sanity, reason, and sense:  eat what you need, follow *ANY* sensible (non-chemical) strength and cardio program, and you're going to look and feel ten times better than the goons and goon-esses you're going to find in the pages (or DVDs) of the Weider 'system'.

May heaven help an industry that steered so many people to needles and pills that'll help kill them.  Before you buy this, ask:  in principle, what's the difference between this stuff and cigarette ads---except that packages of cigarettes actually have to *warn* you?",1281744000,8,1805,4.901315789473684
3514624,1,B001CO428O,"Maybe I should have known by the front cover?!? Not for me! I love to lift weights, and get a great workout, but this was wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy beyond my interest level. The reviews I read stated this was for all levels. I disagree. I was looking for a workout video similar to p90x, this is NOT something to work out with while watching. It is instructional only.",1271116800,6,360,4.46969696969697
3514625,1,B001CO428O,"Joe Weider destroyed bodybuilding. Prior the rise of the Weider empire, and the drugs and mis-information that are a huge part of it, bodybuilding was a healthy endeavor. Before the early 1960's bodybuilders actually got big and stayed big for deacdes without drugs. Training programs were sensable and healthy. A guy like Grimek or Clancy Ross could compete at a natural 220 lbs., look great for deacades and live to a ripe old age. Weider and the drug culture that he promoted ruined all that. Weider created a system where the only way to win was to get bigger and bigger year after year. Of course this means taking more and more drugs. All the while Weider is raking in the cash while guys like Andreas Munzer and Mohammed Benaziza (sp?) died horrible deaths chasing down that Sandow trophy. Their blood is on Weiders hands. To all the young guns tempted by Weider and the glossy magazines (muscle comics), realize this.....it's all an illusion. You can't have what you see is those ridiculous magazines. There is nothing in those magazines that is going to help you in any way. They exist solely to sell suppliments that you don't even need. There is a better way. Forget Weider and the fantasy he sells. Study the ways of the old timers who got big before drugs were even available. They got big and stayed big. They were as strong as they looked. They were as mentally healthy as they were physically healthy. They didn't wind up killing themselves like DeMayo, or killing others like Bertil Fox or Craig Titus. There was a Golden Age of bodybuilding that existed before you or I were even born. Ironically, this is the only time that Joe Weider, himself, ever had ANY muscle. Back then men got big by using what worked and scrapping what was nonsense. These days no one is getting big. Forget Weider and the unatainable fantasy he sells. Work towards something that you can actually achieve.",1270166400,17,1900,4.691616766467066
3514626,4,B001CO428O,"The info on these DVD's is the real deal. most of the books and DVD's made since joe weider have just copied
his work, but they mess up in one way or another.
Buying this is a lot better than throwing your money away on a personal trainer with a two day degree

8288372,4,B001CO428O,"This review is for Joe Weiders Body Building Training System MEGA DVD Edition:
 I have the same complete set (minus DVD 5) in VHS, in other words Ive had the JW Training System for a long time.  These DVDs are transferred from VHS as far as I can tell, and they are not blue ray or High Def, they VHS.  I have a 55 inch HD LCD screen and in full screen they are somewhat blurry.  In normal mode view they are acceptable.  So you should ask yourself, are you buying for the perfect Blue Ray clarity, or for the wealth of information for all levels of body weight building?  If you want the information for beginning, intermediate, and advanced heavy lifting, I believe you will find this within the DVDs  with one caveat  YOU MUST,  MUST watch them over and over and over.  I say that because there is so much information that a beginner could be overwhelmed.
Workouts are explained well in the type of exercise, the technique, number of reps, number of sets, mixing up workouts to get a more rounded symmetrical body for small, medium, and large muscle groups over 10 session workouts.  Mixing up with free weights and machines to find that balance.

I would like to add some personal observations.  I was a cop and served in law enforcement for 10 years, preceeded by a tour in the Army Special Forces (Green Beret).  I stayed in shape during that whole time.  After leaving law enforcement, I decided to increase my mass in muscle.  I use the JW knowledge in these programs with common sense on the nutrition and my mass increased to the point that my former officers couldn't believe I wasn't using steroids.  I have never used steroids.  My ability to lift heavy weights became evident with a Smith Machine squat of 500 lbs free weight, a slanted sled squat of 658 lbs, and a bench press of 300 lbs.  Before I started my bench press was 150 lbs, so I doubled my ability to press, my squat was 340, and my sled was 440lbs.  This system works if you apply to what they tell you on techniques.  Some of the lifters in the DVDs don't quite follow the prescribed technique, which can be for several reasons like an injury or a variance to work a muscle better for that individual.  As far as the nutrition portions .. use various sources outside this dvd and do what works for you.  I suggest you stay natural and not use steroids, but thats me.  I don't want to be Mr. Universe, I just want to be in shape.",1413590400,,2918,4.410207939508506
8288373,4,B001CO428O,"Actually the set is great,  the box itself has a hole in the side/top. But the dvds themselves are undamaged.  I have learned much watching them.",1391990400,,145,4.538461538461538
8288374,3,B001CO428O,What mislead me was the re-lease date of 2008. I guess that is when they took what was probably from the 80s and put it from VHS to DVD. The Quality of the picture is terrible and the awful music in the clips is a huge turn off... other than that it delivers good tips as to what to pay attention to. But the material seems to be outdated ... for this price I would have hoped for something a little more current. I guess this will tell a beginner some usefull things... But for somebody in their 20s it's probably not the best pick.,1369094400,2,533,4.085714285714285
8288375,4,B001CO428O,"This really is a great video but at times it can be very harmful. Okay so on the first DVD you have a woman who is speaking at one point verbally walking you through the correct way to perform a repetition. The way she explained it, was flawless. Then you had the way, as she is speaking of the correct way to perform each and every repetition in one screen a guy appears on the larger screen doing almost the exact opposite way! It is like, sending mixed messages much? She says, ""You have to do every repetition correctly. You want to keep constant tension on the muscle. You see if you lock them out up here at the fully contracted position, the muscles aren't stressed. What you are going to want to do is throughout the movement, keep the tension on the muscle."" She even demonstrates with her arms as when performing a correct bench press. Not once locking her elbows out. Going from her arm fully extended at the most contraction of the chest. Then she brings her hand in to the most stretched pectoral (the technical Latin term for chest)position. Then almost instantly, they cut to the guy literally doing what they had just said not to! He was going down and then locking his elbows all the way out at the top! Now this wouldn't have been so terrible if they put a superimposed big red ex across the screen. At the very least they could have pointed out, in at least subtitles, the great many times during the video where the athlete was performing the exercise incorrectly and very dangerously for the joints! You ask any self respecting exercise physiologist or physical therapist how you get tennis elbow and they will point to the video images and say,""That right there, that's how you could get it in just a few months."" So you have to have a very good base line of knowledge concerning anatomy when your watching this. That way you will be able to, as I was to be able to, point out in the movie who does and doesn't have correct exercise form. It is not just with bench press form though. They have the terrible form in almost every one of the exercises that I've seen on the video so far. From bicep curls with locked out elbows onto leg presses with locked out knees! It is like Arnold said in Pumping Iron,""It will not be that hard to give him, the wrong advices!"" I love Joe Weider and I am saddened that he recently passed away but Joe, how did you allow this man?! For those who have a very, very trusted personal trainer or a good grasp of what should and should not be done regarding exercises, it is actually very in depth. Lots of bodybuilders, from past to present give their takes on a lot of really important topics. From carbohydrate consumption onto protein intake. I have not watched the entirety of the video portion yet but literally six and a half hours of video! It even came with a workout planning CD ROM. Included in the CD-ROM are the ""Joe Weider's Bodybuilding Training System CD-ROM,"" it includes: File 1. System Program Guide File 2. Workout Progress Log and File 3. Nutrition Log. I haven't tried it out yet but as Benjamin Franklin said,""By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."" By those words alone, it is a very worthwhile investment if you are looking to get seriously into bodybuilding, speaking solely on the CD-ROM. In summary, it is not perfect but it isn't garbage either. Contains both positives and negatives in other words.",1367971200,4,3390,4.4959481361426255
