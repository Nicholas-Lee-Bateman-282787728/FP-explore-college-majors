8039295,4,B00066N9ZQ,"I've practiced martial arts for years, but am a novice at leg locks. This DVD gave me what I was looking for. Fundamental leg locks easily explained - from different angles. Vladislav makes it easy to understand and apply the locks and comes across as a good teacher.

All the key steps for each technique are explained, but some of the details aren't. I had to watch the DVD a couple of times to see the nuances. Overall, a good foundation to learn from.",1413590400,,455,4.416666666666667
8039296,3,B00066N9ZQ,"this was a pretty good dvd  koulikov has some good set ups and subs from unorthodox positions good for beginner and up not for the novice as certain things are expected to already be known,.not enough moves on the dvd for me and i would like to seen more but what he has is good stuff as for production it is very plain but clear, this was definetly a earlier in his career dvd as i have his most recent and you can see the difference, is it worth having ? yes i am glad to have this in the vault...",1392681600,,499,3.9405940594059405
8039297,5,B00066N9ZQ,The instructor (Koulikov) walks through each leg attack w/ several repeats so you can easily drill.  He sticks w/ practical locks that people w/ different body structures can execute.,1318550400,,183,5.310344827586207
8039298,5,B00066N9ZQ,This is a fantastic set! All high percentage moves and great Russian belt-grab throws and pick-ups. The throwing dvds are worth the entire set!!! Great stuff and I really love the flying armbar section. Tons of techniques plus fantastic instruction from a Sambo Master (and gentleman. Excellent production quality....a HOME RUN!,1107820800,2,328,5.450980392156863
