8318511,5,B001LLH8OS,"Sharing GOD Kid Style is an awesome funny film.  The children share God with each other in cute spiritual vignettes all based on the word of GOD.  The music or the score sets the tone for each story and the special features rock.  I have played it more than 20 times since I bought it for my children, they love the live action and want to study and learn more about God now that they have seen it.  My church will be booking their live performance troupe this year and I hear it is great comedy.  If you would like to learn more about the word of God or introduce your children, family, friends or who ever to God this is the best way to entertain them and let them learn about God, it is a must see video for all ages.  The Word of GOD is awesome",1231113600,,748,4.02027027027027
