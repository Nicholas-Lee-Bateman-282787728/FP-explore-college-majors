8242305,2,B0011TQ9BI,"Dominik is a mediterranean guy who loves sex.  This video treats us to an interview with him, scenes of him trying on various ""sexy"" clothing (jockstrap, wrestler unitard, et al), working out on a treadmill, getting a (rather uneventful) massage, and (finally!) taking a shower.  And while Dominik is a decent-looking guy with a nice body, he's hardly captivating enough for an hour-long feature.  He has little of interest to discuss during the interview.  And while he continues to ramble on while being massaged, the producers apparently decided whatever was coming out of his mouth was so uninteresting that they covered it up with some mellow music.

In short, if you're willing to spend the day (or even an hour) with Dominik, you really need to get a life.",1215302400,4,763,4.883720930232558
