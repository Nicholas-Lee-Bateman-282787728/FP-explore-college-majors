7960871,5,B000065AYK,"For being ahead of its time, this fantastic look at where an automated driving future is nearly spot-on.
Give it another decade, and we will be actually using automated cars that remove the responsibility of driving. But, what will happen when these cars malfunction? I hope the Ex-Drivers become reality.

Validation for this all-to-short series would be nice.

I, for one, will never stop driving.",1357344000,,399,5.123076923076923
7960872,4,B000065AYK,"The smart-aleck and impulsive Lisa and the more demure, classy, and beautiful Lorna are both Japanese high school students in the near future. Well, that at least qualifies as their day job. In reality they are ""Ex-Drivers"", one of a select few people that still know how to drive cars manually. You see, in their world, AI computers have taken over the driving from humans. But this doesn't mean the system is foolproof. Lisa and Lorna are called on when AI cars get out of control due to computer glitches or viruses. In addition to her love for driving, Lisa longs for a man to sweep her off her feet, but he also has to be a great driver and super intelligent. Two of her three wishes are fulfilled when she's introduced to the newest member of the Ex-Driver team, Souichi, who is perhaps a better driver than her and has skipped a few grades in school to be in her class. The only problem is that he's transferred from elementary school! These first three episodes focus on introducing the characters and the conflicts that arise between them, especially between Lisa and Souichi, who enter into a competitive antagonism to prove who is the better driver.

The animation for this title was really good and the kinetic energy of the chase sequences is underscored by authentic auto sounds and fluid motion. They are not CG cars. As the director of the show states in one of the extras, he decided to use hand drawn animation because of its cohesiveness. The characters are interesting, especially Lisa who comes off as very funny and likeable. At first I didn't really like the introduction of a kid into the show but I acclimated myself to it in a short time. Yes, it is a one trick pony anime but it is still exciting and eye catching.

The extras on the DVD include interviews with the Japanese staff and the sound recording footage of the actual car models used by the Ex-Drivers. Also a brief clip of the actors engaged in go-cart races and a clean opening.

I would also recommend Speed Racer.",1140739200,2,2003,4.573816155988858
7960873,4,B000065AYK,"The premise is a bit outragious, but what anime isn't?  If you are a fan of Kosuke Fujishima's animes (Ah! My Goddess, You're Under Arrest, etc), you won't dispointed.  The animation is top-notch and the quality is excellent.  The series is a short 6 episode ""Original Video Animation"".  There is a movie for the series however there hasn't been a North American release yet.  The story is a bit inconclusive, and the characters are not really developed at all.  However, the car chases through the city are what really caught my eye.  Excellent detail to all the cars and just seeing some current and vintage cars racing through the streets along side of futuristic AI cars is just fun! I would recommend this to anyone who's new to Japan Animation, or a fan of Fujishima's work.  The 2 volumes is very reasonably priced for North American releases these days.  However, if you consider yourself 'hardcore' anime fan, then rent the titles first.",1043107200,,946,4.790123456790123
7960874,3,B000065AYK,"What makes a great car chase? Impressive cars, cool lens effects, famous movie stars in the driver's seat? Well I sure don't think so. I feel that recently in hollywood movies we've seen car chases with overpowered cars, special effects to make look like they're accelerating REALLY fast, slow-mo effects (WAY too many) to emphasize key moments, and plently of stuff that's just plain boring. Just what am I getting at?
If you agree with me that great car chases are about realistic engine sounds, cars behaving realisticly, beautiful exotic sports cars, incredible driving skill, close misses, huge powerslides, and innocent bystanders jumping out of the way in the nick of time, you will love this anime. What can I say? I love car chases, and these are WAY better than what you see in the average american movie nowadays. More like what you'd see in one of the excellent (and highly recommended) short films BMV made as part of it's commercial series ""The Hire"". Truly great stuff.
This anime also features tight animation, and fantastic japanese voice-acting. It's also worth mentioning that the engine sounds on this show are outstanding. If you love hearing exotic engines rev, you'll love the sound on this dvd.
All in all, you only have to ask yourself one question. Do you mind the fact that these car chases are animated instead of live-action? If you answer yes, I feel sorry for you. But if you dig car chase action whatever form it may take, this is the anime for you.",1042502400,2,1481,4.766536964980545

First of all, the plot was just ridiculous. How hard is it to shoot gray globs onto an out of control vehicle, and if it was even hard, WHO REALLY CARES? The villian's motives for causing havoc on the city were just not that interesting or realistic. Once again you find two predictable female characters in anime. One that is determined to prove herself to the world (much like Osuka from Neon Genesis, Evangelion). While there is the counter female character who is sweet and innocent, who does not realize who own beauty (much like Rei from Evangelion).
The first two episodes were badly written and hard to get into. It did not get remotely interesting until Volume 2.
The only thing going for this series was decent dialogue, semi-interesting main character and nice cars. It was a complete disappointment.
If you like cars you may find this series interesting. If you like looking at women with big knockers in cars you will love it.
If you want a nice meaty anime with all the fixings, pass on this one.",1037318400,,1015,4.613259668508287
7960876,5,B000065AYK,"At first, I was having second thought of buying Ex-Driver. Boy, am I glad that I bought it because if I didn't, then I'll probably be regretting about it. After watching Ex-Driver, I would like to considered this one of my all-time favorites anime. Let me break down with the pros and the cons for this anime. Let's start with the pros first:
Pros:  It has a great story, awesome unique cars, comedy, hot babes, and a non-stop heart-pounding thrill ride!!! For any Otaku(s) that are seeking those above, then you should try to pick up a copy of Ex-Driver.
Cons:  Not much Cons here except that it only has 6 episodes total. (3 on the 1st DVD). I just wish that they would've make more episodes, because after watching one episode, you'll hunger for more.",1030233600,5,754,4.536764705882353
