4445028,5,B004Q5XBSS,"This video is the perfect length to show during a youth gathering or Awana meeting to learn about the life of missionaries. This is the third video in the trilogy - The first two were ""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" and ""End of the Spear"". One of these was a feature film while the other was a documentary style telling of the slaughter of missionaries by the tribe they were sent to minister to. In this film you are introduced to the grandson of one of the original missionaries. What makes this family's story so unique and inspiring is that those remaining went back to minister to the tribe that killed their relatives. Forgiveness and redemption are a major theme in this movie. Through the forgiveness and love and willingness to serve this tribe came to know the saving grace of God. Moreover peace and reconciliation was achieved. I have a lot of respect for these missionaries.

4445029,5,B004Q5XBSS,"In 1956 a group of young missionaries was killed by the aucas (or Waodani) tribe in the amazon jungle in Ecuador. They were speared to death by the people they came to serve. One of those missionaries was Nate Saint. His grandchild Jesse Saint, in a very personal and touching narration, tell us his own story. The movie starts with Jesse talking about his family, including his father's sister Rachel, who also lived as  missionary among the same tribe that had killed her brother. When she died, Jesse's father, Steve,  inherited her house, and the indians invited Steve to live among them. So there they went to live in the jungle. He described all the difficulties they faced, with flies in the ""bathroom"", tarantulas etc. He starts developing a friendship with Mincaye, whom after a while he starts calling grandfather. He even tells his tale of killing a deer. Students from a Washington college, participating in an anthropology course, went there to visit them. They were amazed of the reconciliation among all the people there, when they figured out that those among them had killed some of the relatives of the missionaries. The missionaries told that they were the same persons but with different hearts.

This film show us in reality what many of us learn in theory but are afraid to apply to our own lives. Making peace with our enemy. This is hard. Forgive those who hurt us so badly. This is even harder. This inspirational film has been awarded The Dove Foundation seal of approval. It completes a trilogy produced by EthnoGraphic Media (EGM) that includes ""End of the Spear"" and ""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"". Although I did not watch neither of the previous movies, it did not felt like the story was missing something. It stands by itself.

The film was directed by Jim Hanon and produced by Mart Green and B&B Media Group, Inc was kind enough to send me a copy for reviewing through their Blog Review Program. Thank you very much for this inspiring film.",1301011200,,1975,4.7492711370262395
4445030,5,B004Q5XBSS,"Brief Description from DVD Cover:
A young man searches for his identity while living among the tribe that murdered his grandfather.  The Grandfathers is a motion-graphics film by writer/director Jim Hanon and produces Mart Green.  It is the last film in the trilogy that included the documentary Beyond the Gates of Splendor and the feature film End of the Spear.  The Grandfathers is the story of Jesse Saint's quest for significance and wholeness in a world inspired by Nate Saint, the grandfather he never knew and shaped by a father he struggled to understand.  Only after living deep in the Amazon jungle and befriending the men who murdered his grandfather, does Jesse find a greater meaning and purpose for his life.

MY THOUGHTS:
This is quite a  movie!  I enjoyed how there were graphics splattered throughout the film, they tended to lighten the mood a bit!  I have not watched the first two DVD's but did not feel as though I was lost in the middle of a story, this DVD can stand on its own.

Throughout the film Jesse tells his story switching from the short graphic blips to himself and scenes from the Amazon.  As I watched I was nothing short of amazed by how this family was so incredibly forgiving that they could live in the jungle with the very people who had murdered their father/grandfather, and then invite them into their home in the United States!  Throughout the film you learn quite a bit about the Waodani people, their past, and what they are facing in the future as generational gaps become more apparent.

One of my favorite moments in the film was when the college students came for a visit and were having a conversation while sitting at the fire, I'm not going to reveal any more than that it was quite charming to see the reactions of the students as the Waodani answered their questions!

I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in missionaries, or tribes of the Amazon!  This is a Christian film and while it does speak of murder it is done so in a way that would not be disturbing to younger children.

4445031,5,B004Q5XBSS,"The Grandfathers is the third dvd in the mission trilogy that chronicles the lives of the five missionaries who gave their lives to reach the Waodani tribe.
I've had the privilege of viewing End of the Spear and Beyond the Gates of Splendor.  So was happy to review the third and final dvd in this trilogy.  All of the dvds have been inspiring and informative.  If you read the book, Through the Gates of Splendor, like me, you may have followed the lives of the five missionary families who went on to follow through in the work of reaching the Waodani tribe.
This dvd The Grandfathers was a grand conclusion.  The word, forgiveness, stands out in this dvd.  This is not a story it is a documentary given mainly by Jesse Saint the grandson of Nate Saint, the airplane pilot whom the Waodani speared to death.  Jesse is the son of Steve Saint who encouraged his family to continue to interact with the Waodani tribe.
The word grandfather is basically ""nonexistent"" in the Waodani tribe . . . in this dvd the word grandfathers is explained and the usage of 'grandfathers' is used by the Waodani tribe.  I found this explanation fascinating!
This faith lifting ""story""  gives new meaning to reaching out to people for Christ.  Jesse tells of the life of his aunt Rachel Saint and of her continued work with the Waodani peoples.
The journey, the struggle, the legacy. . . don't miss this inspiring conclusion!

4445032,5,B004Q5XBSS,"Over 50 years ago, a group of young American missionaries flew to Ecuador to share the Gospel with an indigenous tribe, the Auca Indians.  Tragically, these young men were ultimately speared to death by the very people they came to serve.  Among them was Nate Saint, father of Steve Saint and grandfather to Jesse Saint.  ""The Grandfathers"", from EthnoGraphic Media is a film that shares Jesse's experience as the grandson of Nate Saint, now somewhat of a martyred celebrity in Christian circles.

Growing up in the shadow of Nate was not the easiest thing for Jesse.  He was frequently introduced as ""Nate Saint's grandson--you know, the missionary who was killed by the Aucas?""  His father Steve had inherited his father's love for missionary work and was known for being somewhat demanding of Jesse as they took trips to serve in the jungle.  There were times when Jesse wanted nothing to do with the life that his father was leading.

""The Grandfathers"" chronicles Jesse's journey from a somewhat rebellious youth to a committed Christian family man, following in the footsteps of his heritage.  At less than an hour in length, this autobiographical documentary tells its story briskly and with flair.  Jesse and the producers of the program have done an excellent job in telling this story in an entertaining, respectful and artistic way.  The look of the film is fresh and modern; I didn't want to take my eyes off it.  The story of the Saint family and the Aucas is compelling, tragic and even sometimes humorous.  My only complaint comes in my desire for this production to be longer.

The film did not receive a ""G"" rating for its ""thematic material and violent content"".  A couple of quick shots of a spearing victim are seen, although no acts of violence are blatantly shown.  The subject matter of this murderous tribe may not be suitable for very young children, but it's handled very tastefully.  There is also a brief recounting of some girls skinny-dipping in the water, but nothing other than some discarded shirts and jeans are shown.

""The Grandfathers"" is the concluding film in the trilogy begun by Beyond the Gates of Splendor (2002) and End of the Spear (2005).  The transformative power of the Gospel is clearly seen in the lives of not only the Auca Indians, but in Jesse's life as well.  I absolutely loved this film and hope that word of mouth allows it to gain a wide audience.  Any church group preparing for a mission trip should watch this, but those struggling with forgiving others would also be touched by the movie's powerful message.  The love and grace of Christ is wide and deep, changing lives and hearts in miraculous ways.  I applaud EthnoGraphic Media and all involved in the creation of ""The Grandfathers"".  They have presented a gift that will touch lives around the world.",1300320000,,2817,4.820833333333334
4445033,5,B004Q5XBSS,"THE GRANDFATHERS is a film about a young man's struggle with his heritage. This DVD completes the triology that includes End of the Spear and Beyond the Gates of Splendor. These films tell the unforgettable and inspiring story of the killing of five missionaries by a stone-age tribe deep in the Amazon jungle. The impact of this tragic event lives on today in families of these slain men as well as among those responsible for their deaths.

Steve Saint consulted with Jim Hanon (director) and Matt Green (producer) to help bring the story of Nate to life through the feature End of the Spear and the companion documentary Beyond the Gates of Splendor. These films traced the events leading up to and including the death of these men. But even more than that, they showed the impact the events played on the lives of both their survivors and their killers.

When the widows and their children went to live among the Waodani--a tribe regarded as the most violent on earth--the became an integral part of an incredible redemptive journey.

THE GRANDFATHERS shows both the burden and benefit of the Saint family's legacy. Jesse Saint, Steve's oldest son and Nate's grandson, was not raised among the tribe. He struggles to find his place under the weight of a famous grandfather he never knew and a heroic father he doesn't understand. This changes when Jesse travels to the jungles of Ecuador with his family and forms a special bond with Micaye--one of the tribesmen who took part in the murder of his grandfather. On then does Jesse come to grips with his family's past and his own destiny.

I was raised with the story of these five missionaries. My mother and aunt knew one of the men who went down there and were murdered, and later were shocked when their wives returned there to continue the work the husbands had begun. So this story has always been a part of me. I was interested in hearing Jesse's story, and the film-making really brought this remote area of Ecuador to life. I could see the animals, plants and people  native to the area and their way of life.

If you are interested in this continuing story of the five murdered missionaries and the impact it has on the subsequent generations, then you will want to watch THE GRANDFATHERS. This is a family approved film, safe for all ages. As Hanon states: Forgiveness is an awe-inspiring virtue that seems to have been passed on by the Saint family and is shared by many among the Waodani tribe--both demonstrate a profound capacity for forgiveness and healthy self-healing."" This film has been awarded The Dove Foundation seal of approval.",1300320000,,2605,4.739514348785872
4445034,5,B004Q5XBSS,"Nate Saint was famous for something most of us would not want. He was murdered by a tribe he was living with in the jungles of the Amazon in Equador. Not only was he murdered but four others he was traveling with, leaving his widow, Rachel behind in the tribe.

What happened after that fateful day would change the Amazon tribe forever in events that are told about in the DVD documentary, The Grandfathers.

We meet the Saint family as they uproot their lives and move to the jungles of the Amazon rainforest to meet the tribe of people living there, the Waodani,that killed their grandfather but to see just how much their lives are forever changed. The saying ""same hands, yet different hearts"" is the theme throughout as we see just how different it is for both cultures to live within each others worlds and to see God's forgiveness played out in this beautiful film.

I received the DVD, The Grandfathers by EGM Films, compliments of B & B Media Group for my honest review. Both my 17 year old daughter and I watched it, often times in amazement, laughter and tears in the 54 minutes. It changed us both and made us realize how different things really are and yet there is wisdom from our grandparents that needs to be listened to and learned from. It makes us not only the people we are today, but able to learn from their ways and grow. I would easily rate this a 5 out of 5 stars for anyone looking to see what a Missionary life is like from a true perspective.

This is the third film in the series that chronicles the lives of the five missionary men who died from Mart Green and Jim Hanon, with End of The Spear and Beyond the Gates of Splendor being the first two. This film has received the Dove Foundation seal of approval. I can't wait to see the first two.",1300233600,,1774,4.366666666666666
4445035,5,B004Q5XBSS,"When Jessie was sixteen years old he was forced by his family to move to Waodani in the Amazon jungle, he was very upset that he was having to leave his home in Florida and go this far away.  Jesse begin to quarrel with his dad and was befriended by  Mincaye.  As the time passed he begin to settle in and begin to call the leader of Waodani  ""Grandfather"" only later did he learn that this elder that he now called Grandfather had been the one that had killed his real Grandfather many years ago.

As Jesse became a part of Mincaye's family, Jesse then began to see the problems the Waodani were having and the danger that they were facing in losing their culture. He really felt bad when he begin to see the young people of the tribe leaving and going to larger cities.  Jesse had by now learned what it means to respect the ways of the past and was hoping that he and Mincay could build a future together.

This film was very interested and nice to watch and listen to the music that plays during the film.  Makes you feel as though you are there.

4445038,4,B004Q5XBSS,"I don't normally watch any kind of documentaries. They are just BORING to me. But, something called out to me when I had the chance to review this DVD and so I took it. I was VERY pleased the results of viewing this DVD. It's very informative and VERY moving. The one thing I didn't like about the DVD, however, is that it's a 3rd in a 3 part series. I missed out on a lot without knowing what happened in the first 2 parts.

If you are looking for a DVD that is informative and filled with God's love and unending grace and mercy, then this is the DVD for you. Filled with murder, healing, redemption and forgiveness, you won't know what hit you as this documentary moves the viewer. My recommendation, though? Watch the first two. I am going to go back and watch the first 2 parts along with this one and get a better understanding about the people of the Tribe and feel more of the moving emotion that hits you. A DVD worth 4 stars, hands down!

4445039,5,B004Q5XBSS,"This movie is a documentary that had me riveted to the screen.  I grew up hearing about Jim Elliot and the missionaries that died with him by the very tribe of people they were trying to help.  It always made me sad, but this movie brought that to life.  Not so much on their actual deaths (though when those that murdered them talk about what happened afterwards I was in tears) as much as how the love of God caused family members to go minister to the very people that killed the missionaries in the first place.  Jesse Saint really opens up and reveals what it is like to live under the expectations of those that heard about his grandfather (Nick Saint, one of the missionaries) and how he became his own man while living among those that killed his own grandfather.  A moving story of God's forgiveness that I can't wait to share with my children.",1306281600,5,853,4.407643312101911
4445040,3,B004Q5XBSS,"The story of Nate Saint and Jim Elliot's martyrdom in South America at the hands of the Waodani is certainly one of the best known stories of missionary devotion amongst the North American church.  Books have been written, documentaries made, and the spiritual progress of the Waodani people closely followed.  The latest DVD in the journey of the Saint family and those they minister to is The Grandfathers and follows Jesse Saint's experiences among the Waodani as a teenager and adult both in the jungle and at home in North America.

Jesse Saint is the son of Steve Saint and the grandson of Nate Saint.  Told through his eyes, viewers are able to see the Waodani progress towards independence and the challenges they face as they begin integrating with the wider world around them.  Jesse's bonds of affection with the men who murdered his grandfather are also explored - the men he now affectionately calls his grandfathers.  It also explores Jesse's lack of direction and focus in his life and his uncertainties surrounding his personal identity (those these are never entirely resolved).

Having been captivated by the incredible grace and love presented in The End of the Spear I was eager to watch The Grandfathers.  Apart from some incidental mentions of baptism, the blood of Jesus, asking God what He thinks (once and this was Steve), a spiritual experience following the deaths of Elliot and Saint, and the influence of Christianity on the Waodani (comments made by a college student), there isn't really any direct drawing of attention to the difference Jesus has made in the lives of those portrayed in the documentary.  I have to say that I am very disappointed by this.  With such an opportunity to call attention to the life-changing faith that Jesus gives His followers.

While production quality is high, the story line is a bit choppy and jumps around without any real unifying thread.  I think the unifying element that is missing is Jesus.  How does Jesse feel about Jesus today?  How does he feel about the work that Jesus has done amongst the Waodani?  About the forgiveness that Jesus has wrought in their hearts?  It just isn't there.  Instead we are left with some teenage angst with only a smattering of forgiveness thrown in, and that a somewhat vague forgiveness, the heart of the message is missing.",1305676800,6,2332,4.878172588832487
4445041,5,B004Q5XBSS,"This film was absolutely spectacular! I had heard of the missionaries that died in Ecuador growing up in the church, but it never really hit me the far reaching effects that could come from that one event so many years ago. This riveting film allows you to follow the journey of Jesse Saint and how he came to terms with the people that killed his grandfather.
Apart from the story itself I thought the film was well done, the angles were cool, the music was amazing and it even had a bunch of extras. I really like the four video journals from the director each covering a different aspect or undercurrent of the story. These would be super helpful if you wanted to use the film as a discussion group or something like that.
Bottom line I can not say enough good stuff about this film and will be recommending it to all my friends!!! Check out the other films that EGM have done too!",1303516800,,884,4.363636363636363
4445042,3,B004Q5XBSS,"If you met the man who murdered your grandfather, would you ever call that man your ""Grandfather""?

This first-person documentary video follows the life experiences of Jesse Saint, the grandson of legendary, missionary martyr, Nate Saint.  This is Jesse's story, not Nate's, not even the Waodoni's - the tribe that massacred Nate Saint and four other missionaries in 1956 in the jungles of Ecuador.

Jesse's dad, Steve Saint, took his family to Ecuador to live for one year while Jesse was a teenager.  The lessons Jesse learned there have helped shape his life, his goals and his dreams.

One poignant moment in the video comes when the viewer realizes that the handful of older men sitting in a large circle around a campfire are the same men that perpetrated countless murders in their younger days, including the five martyred missionaries.  The transformation that Jesus Christ brought about in their lives is stark and amazing.  It is moving to see Jesse develop a close relationship with the man who murdered his grandfather.

SO WHAT?
Even though this is Jesse Saint's story, it is really God's story, a testament to His sovereignty in every situation.

The video is saturated with quality special effects, obviously targeting Jesse's ""under thirty"" generation.  Certain ""PG"" elements including a portrayal of the tribe's violent history make the video unsuitable for younger children.

One aspect of the video that totally surprised me was the disappointing lack of clear Christian content.  The revolutionary message of Jesus takes a back seat to the ""discover yourself"" message so prevalent in secular media.  A general lack of direction, and a meandering plot made we wonder at times what the point of the story was.

I think I was expecting the video to stand alone.  In its defense, it is the third in a series.  Watching the other two excellent movies first would prevent the viewer from that vague feeling of being lost without a backstory.

WHY DID I WATCH THIS DVD?
Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this DVD free from B&B Media as part of their blogger review program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: ""Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.""",1303171200,8,2354,4.994871794871795
4445043,4,B004Q5XBSS,"Of all the missionary stories, probably none is more popular than that of Jim Elliot, Nate Saint, and others who were killed on the field while trying to take the gospel to the Waodani people. Previously audiences have been treated to an in-depth documentary ""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" and a full length feature film ""End of the Spear."" Both films focused on the family of Nate Saint and their journey of faith after his death.

""The Grandfathers"" continues that journey and chronicles the story of  Jesse Saint, grandson of Nate Saint. He explains his life here in the USA and then his journey for the first time to the jungles of  Ecuador among the Waodani people where his grandfather and 4 others were killed. He confesses the struggles of dealing with the fame of his grandfather's story, coping with life in the jungle setting, and building a relationship with the very men who killed his grandfather. It reveals the struggles, griefs, and joys among the Saint family.

The production of ""The Grandfathers"" is very well done and is a great picture of a family who has been through an incredible journey. The only downside to ""The Grandfathers"" was the lack of a clear gospel presentation and Christian message. For a story based around a group of men who could be called the most well known Christian missionaries, the absence of a clear presentation of the Christian message in this video was disappointing. Still the video is a great discussion starter about missions and the power of forgiveness.

4445044,4,B004Q5XBSS,"The Grandfathers is an hour-long documentary which builds on the familiar story of Nate Saint. Nate Saint (and Jim Elliot and three other men) was a missionary who was killed by the tribe he went to minister to.

Remember the movie (which was originally a book) End of the Spear? That's about them. Anyway.

The Grandfathers is told from the perspective of Nate's grandson Jesse who has a hard time identifying with who Grandpa Nate really is - beyond all the fame of being a martyr. Jesse narrates the movie and talks about the difficulties of moving to Ecuador with his family and learning to live alongside the people who murdered his grandfather.

This would be great for kids (and grown-up kids) of most ages. It gives lots of background information about Ecuador, the Indian tribe, and the well-known story of the martyred missionaries.  Additionally (and more importantly), it highlights the relationship between Jesse and his Ecuadorian grandfathers, which gives an excellent picture of God's grace lived out in the Saint family.

At times the film is more educational than entertaining. However, it would be a great addition to anyone's video library. The film is rated PG.

4445045,5,B004Q5XBSS,"The book Through Gates of Splendor tells the story of five brave young missionaries who gave their lives to reach the Waodani people for Christ. The book also inspired a documentary, Beyond the Gates of Splendor, which shows interviews with the Waodani and the widows and children of the martyred missionaries. One of those left behind, Nate Saint's son Steve, then wrote a book called End of the Spear, which was made into a major motion picture of the same name.

The legacy of this story now continues in a documentary called The Grandfathers, featuring Steve's son, Jesse Saint. In this documentary, Jesse tells the story of his time living with the Waodani tribe and how he built relationships with the men who speared his grandfather--men who are now believers desiring to follow the one true God. They played important roles in his life as he searched for his own purpose in Christ.

I've admired the families involved in this story for years and, during my younger days, wondered what it would be like to be one of them. I assumed my spiritual journey would have been easier had I shared their powerful legacy. Jesse's story reminded me that God acts with perfect wisdom when He puts us into families and chooses the circumstances of our life journeys. As Psalm 139 says, ""All the days ordained for [us] were written in Your book before one of them came to be."" It didn't matter that Jesse Saint's grandfather and father were famous men of God, he still had to find his own place in the world--apart from the burden of expectations their legacies created.
