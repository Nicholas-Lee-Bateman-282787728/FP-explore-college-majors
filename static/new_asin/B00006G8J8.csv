1752644,5,B00006G8J8,"Now I know that a lot of people thought that The X-files went bad after season 5, but I love this season!  This was the first season of The X-Files I watched, and it's a good thing, cause I was naive and back then the early episodes would have scared the ... out of me!
This season has some of the funniest episodes, most notably ""Three of a Kind"" which features The Lone Gunmen.  I also like ""The Rain King,"" especially Scully's line: ""The blind leading the blind.""  Buy this season!
I'm not just a junkie for the new seasons though, I have all the DVDs except season 4.  That's probably in the top 3 of my favorite seasons, so why don't I have it?  I'm a lazy teenager.  I barely have a job and not enough money to buy season 4.  I'm going to have to sell some limbs and organs to buy the rest of the seasons... any takers?",1028246400,2,825,4.086956521739131
1752645,5,B00006G8J8,"In spite of what others may think, to me, this is by far, the best season. Taking new heights of entertainment, the series was, noticeably, a more mature television event. After The X Files movie, the team moved to LA, and continued with a whole new team. The predominance of humorous episodes throughout the entire season, did not turn off hardcore fans, but on the contrary. I, personally, am the owner of the previous 5 box sets and am eagearly waiting for the release of the last 2 real X Files seasons (Being 6 and 7 the ones I refer to).
Even though the mithology concludes here, the Samantha mistery gets cleared up until the next season, at the end of wich, Mulder is abducted and the series was transformed in a confusing mixup than even Chris Carter doesn`t understand.
As for mithology episodes on this season:
Watch ""The Beginning"" and the 2 part myth-arc ""Two Fathers- One Son"", wich brings the Series`mythology to an explosive conclusion.
The Stand Alone (Or Monster of the Week) eps. include highlights such as:
""Monday"" (Groundhog Day X -Files style-), ""Triangle"" and ""The Ghosts That Stole Christmas"" (The CC helmed episodes), ""Milagro"", ""Terms of Endearment"", ""Dreamland 1 and 2""
""Three of a Kind"" (Scully and The Lone Gunmen, a must see!), ""Field Trip"", ""Aqua Mala"" and David Duchovny`s brainchild: ""The Unnatural""
It`s a pity that DD got transformed into such an ambitious and egotistical person... The series would have been great up to Season 9, with Mulder in it.
Chris Carter didn`t know when to stop and the series got transformed into God knows what. It just doesn`t feel like the X Files anymore, not with Dogget and Reyes in them (I say this, even though I like their characters, it`s just that they are not THE X Files, Mulder and Scully ARE).
That`s the difference between an artist and a business man. You have to realize when`s the proper moment to go with a bang. We saw the show transformed from a sleeples hit to a hit cult TV show, to a sorry thing I don`t know what to call anymore. I hope the next movie is as good as the first one. In the meanwhile I will sit in the dark, waiting for the next 2 boxed sets to be released.
Note:
I know that the last 2 seasons sucked, at least that`s my opinion, but I`m gonna buy them... It`s hard to be a fan.
The movies are gonna pick up from the last episode of the 9th season, so, I wanna have the whole thing. Not being left on the dark forever.
Long live the X Files!!!
Long live Mulder!!!
Long live SCULLY!!!

1752646,3,B00006G8J8,"Hot on the heels of the big-budget movie, the sixth season marks the beginning of the down turn in the X-Files series.  Much of the  suspense of the first five seasons is gone here as the sci-fi (as opposed to sf) aspects of the show really come to dominate the mythology.  The fun of pondering the main mystery up to this point was the scary possibility that the government is involved in deceiving us.  This season it becomes merely annoying due to inconsistencies in the stories and the beginning of the less scary idea that it's just aliens and their human dupes, not the government, who are running the conspiracy.
Meanwhile the Monster of the Week eps vary widely.  There are a few very good stories (""Drive"", ""Monday"", ""The Unnatural"", ""Field Trip"") that successfully comment on Mulder & Scully's relationship by exploring their interactions with the one-time characters whose lives they intersect.  Several other episodes are amazingly bad, however, in terms of story, character, and/or (surprisingly) special effects.  Check out--or rather, don't--""Arcadia"" for an episode that acheives the hat trick.  Also in this latter category are ""Terms of Endearment"", ""Agua Mala"", and ""Alpha"".  Too many episodes try to be funny when they can't be suspenseful, or the when the MoW is too poorly developed:  ""The Rain King"", ""Arcadia"", ""Three of a Kind"".  The requisite two-parters are exactly that--requisite sweeps week ""movies"" that Ten-Thirteen had gotten into the habit of making.  ""Dreamland"" and ""DL II"" is a character-switch story that rehashes some of the themes of season 4's ""Small Potatoes"".  ""Two Fathers""/""One Son"" seems to have been made solely to tie up much of the mythology so that any new viewers brought in by the movie wouldn't get bored by the sheer weight of accumulated plot strands.  These longer stories do little except make fans fondly recall the great 2-part epics of seasons 2, 3 and 4.
In between are a few other decent-to-standout (opinions vary) singular episodes such as ""Triangle"" and ""How The Ghosts Stole Christmas"" and again, ""The Unnatural"" (written and directed very well by David Duchovny), and the Scully-centric episodes in this season--""Milagro"" & ""Tithonus""--are at least much better than season 5's ""Chinga"" and ""All Souls"" at exploring Scully's role apart from Mulder, and Gillian Anderson shines in both episodes.  ""S.R. 819"" gives Mitch Pileggi's A.D. Skinner a chance to get directly involved in a tantalizing aspect of the mythology, but this subplot is dropped after season 6, and literally shot down at the end of season 8, without any further exploration.
Don't know the details on the bonus material, but the last disc is usually packed with interesting mini-documentaries, deleted scenes and special effects, and lately there have been some good commentary tracks as well.

Overall, if you're a fan you've already made a decision to buy this set, and at least the ratio of good-to-bad is higher here than in season 5.  Unfortunately if you're looking for the really good episodes on DVD, there are only a few here, and this is the only (legitimate) way to go.",1027900800,19,3114,5.05078125
1752647,5,B00006G8J8,"This season was amazing. After the incredible Season 5 ending, the movie gave a vision of the mythology that was very well taken in Season 6. It opens with ""The Beginning"", where we see Gibson Praise again, as well as Agent Diane Fowley. It deals with the gestation of a new alien out from an infected person from the Black Oil.
Although the Season has its flaws like ""The Rain King"" (which started so good but had such a terrible conclusion), there are episodes like ""One Son"" and ""Biogenesis"" which make this season one of the most interesting. This is a season for answers, a lot of explanation of the conspiracy, the proyect and the syndicate in some big episodes. The tendency to leve more questions than answers is left behind. The Season Finalie ends in an amazing scene where Scully has an alien spaceship infront of her adn Mulder becomes the ultimate proof of the X Files.
Perhaps after this Season, the series mythology becomes more personal to Mulder and Scully, turning them into the foci of attention, but the truth is that this season is the point of no return for the mythology.

1752648,5,B00006G8J8,"The X-files 6th season was fun.
""Dreamland 1 & 2"" are wonderful.  Mulder switches bodies with an employee from area 51.  He finds out a lot and forgets it in the end.  At least he gets a waterbed out of the deal.
""Triangle"" is a bit ""Wizard of Oz"", a bit ""Titanic"",  & a bit X-Files (of course).  Mulder hits head while looking for a ship that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle. He travels to another world where Scully is a tough and beautiful scientist..  Cancerman is a Nazi in the flashback or alternative dimension of 1939. Skinner, Kerch and Spender make appearances as other people on the boat.  It is shot with in the same technique as Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rope"".
""Arcadia"" is about designed and anally perfect subdivisions. Mulder and Scully pretend their married.  Their undercover names are Rob & Laura Petrie, just like on the ""Dick Van Dyke Show"".
""Monday"" is the bank robbery they keep reliving daja vu style until they get it right.
On the Series Mythology Tip:  ""Two Fathers/One Son"" unfolds the Conspiracy and Biogenesis brings Mulder to the nuthouse (again).
Other Great Eps: ""The Ghosts Who Stole Christmas"",  ""Rainking"" (more Wizard of Oz references) ""Three of a Kind"" (Lone Gunman in Vegas).",1027555200,10,1213,4.788461538461538

is genuinely one of the most imaginative series I have ever seen.  It can move from
horrible creepiness to the quiet rapture of a friendship so steadfast and enduring
that it could rival Katherine and Heathcliff In Wuthering Heights.  As they navigate the
darkness of a world sometimes insane, sometimes bizarre beyond belief, and
sometimes sorrowful, we see two people who are meant for each other, soul to soul.
If all the world was full of Mulders and Scullys, it would be truly blessed!!!",1447113600,,590,4.8316831683168315

The characters are fantastic together - I love that Mulder is so open minded and willing to except the impossible, but thankfully he has Scully to bring him back to reality - lets be honest though, 9/10 times Mulder's theories are right! There is a story going on, but most of the episodes can be watched alone without ever knowing anything about the show.

1753469,5,B00006G8J8,"Season 6 is quite outstanding for so many reasons that I could write a book on each one. However, even though I like to write and opinionated, I will refrain from much of that commentary.

If you have not seen the rest of the series, or know what is/is not happening to this story line, you may not wish to read below. New fans are what will keep this alive for a long time. It is a great series and one which should continue to show future generations how remarkably well this series was produced from all aspects. Enjoy...

The episodes of this season are some of the best produced during this fantastic 9 year run of arguably one of the best shows to ever grace the small screen. I am a mythology/mytharc fan and still enjoy the stand-alones. The Unnatural is one of my favorites, as is the Dreamland pair and the Two Fathers/One Son pair. The end of the season finally sees truth reveal itself to Scully the Skeptic. Season 7 concludes this story and leaves us with little to imagine. However, Chris Carter and the gang came up with more interesting stand-alone episodes and a very logical continuation of the Scully-Mulder story. It is very interesting to watch how it unfolds and ends in Season 9.

My only regret to this great series is that Fox and 1013 and the actors never got it together to produce a timely film to continue the myth arc. They ruined their chance at a much larger audience for the first post-series film. I hope it wasn't the only one as there is a lot to tell, if one can be creative in picking it up 12-15 years after the show ended. Maybe some retrospective look at first, then all off to fight the future as ex-FBI agents. Robert Patrick is in a new series for CBS this Fall and Anabeth Gish could be busy as well. We know of Duchovny and Anderson's desires to continue the characters and story, but they will be older... and so will William. It would be the era of the Super Soldiers, so maybe something there to pique our interests would be appropriate. However, the two main actors are now busy and to take time off to consult with and film the story would take quite a long time.

So, my best guess is that we have seen the fantastic series unfold (many times for many of us, I am sure) and the two films in an attempt to align with the series and that there will no more new X-Files stories to enjoy. If they continue with another film, it will need to be produced in Canada and the US, on location and be a part of the mytharc.

Enjoy this season as it is quite well done even though it was not produced in Vancouver, which had the most enthralling ambiance due to the team assembled by Carter and 1013.",1408665600,,2641,4.305835010060362

Also, as the series went on, D.Duchovny's character was less involved to the point where he quit the show. Up until his departure, you could sense that the chemistry was ruined between him and Scully due to the different direction the show was taking.

1753561,5,B00006G8J8,"Some people like to trace the fall of ""The X-Files"" to its sixth season. Frankly, I think this is a fallacy. The roots to the series' decline are largely located in the fifth season and the ""Fight the Future Movie"" (both began to needlessly entangle the mythology, alienating viewers along the way). In fact, I'd argue that the sixth season tried very valiantly to undo any damage along the way. Let me explain.

As mentioned above, the fifth season and movie introduced a bunch of plot points that started to complicate things for our favorite FBI agents. Alien vaccines, rebel shape-shifters, et cetera. However, in the sixth season, Carter et al decided to kill off the Syndicate in a fantastic mid-season finale ""Two Fathers""/""One Son"". At the time, it made total sense; the Syndicate was just dead weight at this point, since their motivations were completely revealed and one of their most charismatic leaders (Well Manicured Man) was dead. It made much more sense for the Smoking Man to sneak away and continue his evil deeds in secret.

However, the seventh and eight seasons are where the ball gets dropped. Many of the plot points that were tidied up for a series finale in the seventh season (which was originally supposed to be the show's last) were simply dropped. The vaccine? Never heard about again. The alien rebels? Who? Alien colonization? Lol, yeah it's supposed to happen in 2012 (thanks last episode). While some plot points got resolved (like the search for Mulder's sister), the majority didn't. This is the reason the sixth season is often called either the ""last good one"" or the ""first bad one"". Frankly, it isn't the season's fault; it's the seasons that follow that fail to live up to what season 6 promise that are to blame. For instance, the season ends with a major cliff-hanger: Scully finds the wreckage of an alien spaceship in Africa! That's really cool!! But the seventh season premiere has something to do with aliens, and the Bible, and Mulder getting a headache, and lots of running, and no answers, and poor pacing, etc. etc.

Also, many fans were alienated by the ""funny"", ""romantic"", or ""experimental"" episodes. Frankly, I think they are some of the series' best. ""Triangle"" (the one wherein Mulder fights time-Nazis) is one of the series' best episodes ever, and episodes like ""Dreamland"" and ""Arcadia"" are just so ridiculous but amusing. Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny really seem energized this season, too (something that the following three seasons would lack), which makes even the stupidest episodes (Ahem, ""Agua Mala""... ahem, ""Alpha"") OK to deal with. You can tell too that the writers were having a lot of fun thinking of wacky concepts (a man's head is going to explode -- ""Drive"" -- or Mulder and Scully get caught in a time loop and die again and again and again -- ""Monday"" -- or an alien decides that he loves baseball -- ""The Unnatural""), and just ran with them, producing some really solid and memorable stand-alone episodes.

Stand-outs include (ranked from best): ""Triangle"", ""Monday"", ""The Unnatural"", ""Drive"", ""Two Fathers""/""One Son"", ""Field Trip"", ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"", and ""Dreamland I/II"". As you can see, there's a lot of good stuff here. If you're a die-hard X-Phile then I highly recommend this season. Also, even if you're just a casual fan, I'd recommend getting it since there's so much good stuff here.",1385683200,,3393,4.9162303664921465

What unfolds is an instinctive need to move west at certain speed to avoid the same fate and David D character driving the Bryan C character in an effort to avoid the inevitable. What is revealed is a govt sort of sound wave test that caused the disruptive vibration in their head and eventually his death. Oh leads are reprimanded it seems for trying investigate.

There are some fun and typically good X-files stories here. My favorite is the two part ""dreamland' where mulder switches bodies with another man.  I don't think the show was anything but at it's peak still in this season. And the next for that matter. The last two only suffer from the lack of enough muddler episodes. but they were still good. And I don't buy that this was the start of a falling show. Not at all. It looks great on dvd and this is one season that hd would really upgrade it.",1380326400,,979,4.219251336898396

Like Kolchak they never have enough physical evidence to prove the strange happenings, even though they always solve their cases.  I bought all six years of X-Files and the two movies.

According to Wikipedia, this season was the first one filmed in Los Angeles. Previous seasons were filmed in Vancouver. Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan wrote seven episodes, including Drive, which featured one Bryan Crantson, who later became Walter White.

We had to go to the next chapter, and then rewind back to the part just past the skipping. Mood killer. On the last disk, there is a smudge near the center of the DVD and also a line like a scratch or a defect. We could not get either of the last two episodes to play at all!! We tried different chapters, fast forwarding to try to get past the defect, nothing worked. SO disappointed!!! This was supposed to be a new DVD set that should work perfectly. We are careful with the disks and they are only ever in their case or in the computer. This weekend was the first time that that particular disk ever left the packaging  - I am 100% sure we did not cause the damage. Very, very unhappy.",1370908800,,856,4.125748502994012

Not to say that many of the episodes were new to the world since some episodes did take ideas from previous and older TV shows but the way it was presented to a new generation diving into the beginning of a new techological era marked the show as a cult or an iconic piece of art that will be in our memories for many years to come.

The season begins very strong  with episodes taking place right in the aftermath of the 'Fight The Future' movie. The show offers up some really nice monster-of-the-week episodes as well, many of which see Mulder and Scully acting at their best and most playful. Perhaps the only downside of the season is that it peaks too early and never quite matches the high it sets at the midpoint.

To be an actor on the X-Files was a fabulous trip: watch for Michael McKean (twice) and Brian Cranston (pre-Breaking Bad).  I wanted to revisit Season Six because I had just watched the movie again, and I remembered a certain light sexual tension in the series between Mulder and Scully following the aborted kiss in the movie.  There are some funny moments in episodes that play on this.  But in the episode ""Field Trip,"" you can see Scully's pain when she fears that Mulder is dead.  Then at the end of the episode, they hold hands while on opposite gurneys in the ambulence after almost having been eaten alive by flesh-eating dirt in a field of magic mushrooms.

I think Mark Snow's music in this episode is really what makes it. I especially love the harpsichord creepily playing the first few notes of Bing Crosby's ""I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas"" when they pry up the floorboards, a VERY subtle musical callback to the song that's playing when they pull up in their cars at the very beginning of the episode.

You get drawn in by the characters and feel part of their lives and situations.  Chris Carter, the creator of the show, changed TV viewing of what a sci-fi series could be.

I know that most X-Philes love the series for its 'alien mythology' saga, but I come from the perspective of someone who favors the stand-alone episodes, the creepier the better. That being said, Season-6 contained some of my favorite stand-alones, and not even all the silly comedy episodes they jammed into Season-6 could sway me from my views. There are enough X-Files reviews on this site to cover most of the episodes, so I'll just focus on my 3 favorite Season-6 stand-alones:

TITHONUS--features an immortal news photographer who, as we soon learn--is chasing Death. Scully works on this case with an agent other than Mulder. A lot of engaging and thoughtful conversation between Scully and the reporter, a lot of quiet, creepy moments.

MONDAY--Mulder is reliving a horrible day over and over and over. A lot of philosophical conversation about fate, destiny, and whether or not we are helpless against it. Excellent characterization with some weighty concepts.

FIELD TRIP--one of the more imaginative and fantasy-laden X-Files episodes where Mulder and Scully find themselves role-playing in a customized dreamland... Or are they? Fantastic moments of revelation and shock.

Other notable stand-alones are ALPHA, TREVOR and DRIVE-- respectively featuring a werewolf, a comicbook-type super villian, and the tragic victim of an eerie illness.

The blend of humour & horror can be a little choppy, but this season has a weight lacking in most of the earlier seasons.
One bone to pick: Scully's truculent scepticism started to grate, although, thankfully, Mulder gave her pause to rethink this in ""Field Trip"".

The shift in locale to the Western U.S. also added to the show's visual and dramatic scope: episodes such as ""Drive"", ""Dreamland"" and ""Arcadia"" were well suited to, and enhanced by, the arid settings.

1753791,4,B00006G8J8,"While I still enjoyed this season, there are some reasons why it wasn't as good as previous seasons:

1. Moving to California definitely changed the look of the series. It suddenly became so sunny and clear, the dimness and spookiness of Canada was gone! And it took a while to find good lighting for Scully, for most of the season she looked old.

2. Too many comedy episodes in the beginning of the season. At some point I started thinking it became some kind of parody of X-Files, not actual X-Files.

3. The main mytharc was totally finished off, and very quickly. I was very sad to see this story line go. So many years to build it and then 2 episodes and it's all over. Where do X-Files go from here?

4. Finally, I got really tired of all the flirting between Scully and Mulder. Like many, I wanted them to be together, but I didn't want to be teased. Either go all the way, or let their relationship be the way it used to before, I say.

That being said, it was still great season, just a little thin on really great episodes.",1239926400,2,1034,4.282051282051282
1753792,2,B00006G8J8,"A new fan of these series I fell in love with the show becoming addicted to it, talking about nothing but The X Files, etc. The movies was great. However the return to the show was very disappointing.  I really enjoyed that once in a while there would be a ""comedy"" X Files episode to have some variety, but on this season they over did it. Most of this season is comedy, and some of them very cheesy comedy. Only a few episodes are serious like the good old classic X Files episodes, and even some of those ""serious"" episodes have some moments of cheesy comedy that turn you off.

The 2nd disappointment is something on the ""Mulder/Scully"" subject (don't wanna go in detail to give any spoilers). Something unexpected is happening with their partnership in the movie. It doesn't get solved in the movie which made me think it was a very smart way to make people watch this season hoping this matter was solved or at least talked about. Wrong, I'm still waiting for that conversation between the 2 of them. This season makes it seem like that moment of the movie (my fav part) never even happened.

As most fans I used to think ""wouldn't it be nice if they did the show again?"", but it is seasons like this that make you go ""nah, just leave it the way it is"".

I would definitely try to rent this season before wasting your money, unless you are a collector and you must have all the DVDs.",1237420800,5,1389,4.351351351351352

One of my favorite episodes, Written and Directed by David Duchovny himself.

Touches on subjects like racism, friendships, sacrifice (albeit briefly).  Gives us insight into the culture/traditions of an alien race living amongst us & the lenghts one would go through to break away from them.  With a backdrop of 1940's America.

Excellent music in the background, primarily that of ""Come and Go With Me to That Land"" by Bernice Johnson Reagon.

In a nutshell, it's a touching story of how baseball brought together two unlikely friends & the freedom many of us feel on the playing field.",1224201600,,649,4.908256880733945
1753796,5,B00006G8J8,"I've rewatched a lot of these episodes in anticipation of the new movie coming out. It only confirmed my opinion that Season Six was my favorite season of this show, with more stand-alone episodes that I rewatch again and again than any of the other seasons. I love ""Triangle,"" the episode where Mulder finds himself on a World War II era ship and Scully goes into overdrive trying to get him help. ""Dreamland Parts One and Two"", a sort of body-switching episode, is also fun. ""Tithonus"" is a spooky episode about an immortal photographer who always knows when someone is about to die and waits around to take pictures. ""Arcadia"" is the episode where Mulder and Scully go under cover as husband and wife to investigate a series of deaths in an uptight planned community. Very funny. ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"" is an X-Files classic, Mulder and Scully scouting out a haunted house on Christmas Eve. ""Monday"" is The X-Files version of ""Groundhog Day,"" as Mulder lives the same crappy day over and over until he figures out how to stop a bank holdup from turning fatal. Carol Burnett's daughter, who led a somewhat troubled life and later died of cancer, does a particularly good job here as the bank robber's desperate girlfriend. It's creepy watching her, knowing her background and what happened to her a few years later. ""Milagro"" is a strange one about a writer who fixates on Scully to the point that one of his characters nearly rips her heart out. It's strongly implied here that Mulder and Scully are in love. The two that I rewatch most often are ""Rain King"" and ""The Unnatural."" ""Rain King"" is a valentine of an episode, about a guy whose unrequited love for his best friend results in unexplained weather phenomena in a small Kansas town. It's sweet and romantic and has some great comic moments as the guy and the girl (and Mulder and Scully?) make their way to each other. ""The Unnatural"" was written and directed by David Duchovny, who is quite a gifted writer. It's a great story about an alien who fell in love with the game of baseball. Duchovny also throws in some commentary about race relations, the meaning of life and love, and the dangers of obsession, all without hammering the viewers over the head with it. The episode also includes some nice scenes with Mulder showing Scully how to play baseball. I don't care for the myth-arc episodes, but those who do should find some meat in ""Two Fathers"" and ""One Son"" and ""Biogenesis.""  I thought ""Alpha"" was a bit of a dog (pun intended) and didn't particularly enjoy ""Trevor."" ""Three of a Kind"" is a Lone Gunmen-centric episode and ""Field Trip"" has its comic moments.

1753798,4,B00006G8J8,"Maybe the last ""classic"" season for some purists, this is where The X Files tried to expand their horizons after the movie, and the result was more emphasis on the comedic episodes. And while we don't have any trouble with that, the main problem this season had was in programming: they put the majority of the comedy episodes right in the beggining, one after another, and that made the season pretty uneven.  But please don't get me wrong, most of the episodes are really great as usual, and for the whole series is the turning point after the whole Conspiracy mithology is definitely exposed and given a resolution, and some of the stories are given a Twilight Zone mood (this will be fully applied in Season 9).

In my book two of the episodes don't work that well, and those will be ""The Rain King"" (good in its own, but way too light for The X Files), and ""Agua Mala"" (which starts ok, but seems that for the ending they didn't know what to do).

1753822,5,B00006G8J8,"[...] Out of all 9 seasons of The X-Files, I would have to say that season 6 was my favorite. Season 6 was the season after The X-Files movie, Fight the Future (Released Summer 1998).

While I enjoyed almost all of the episodes during season 6, I would have to say there are quite a few that stand out from the rest. These episodes include:

Triangle - Mulder goes to the Bermuda Triange when he learns that the Queen Anne, a British luxury liner which disappeared during WWII, has re-appeared in the middle of the Sargasso Sea. Mulder's boat is wrecked and after floating in the water, he is hauled aboard the ship which has just been hijacked by the Nazis searching for the man who will build the atom bomb. Mulder tries to convince the crew that they have traveled into the future but evidence further suggests that it is he, who is back in the past.

Dreamland 1&2 - While being detained near the famed ""Dreamland"" Area 51, a strange craft flies overhead and Mulder swaps bodies with an Area 51 'Man-in-Black'. While the other agent has fun in Mulder's body, Mulder himself finds it difficult to fit into someone else's life, especially a shadowy one.

How the Ghosts Stole Christmas - Mulder talks Scully into investigating a haunted house on Christmas Eve where several couples have met their fate on that very night. While there they encounter endless tricks and traps set by a ghostly couple who originally made a lovers suicide pact in the house, and they try to convince Mulder and Scully to kill each other.

Arcadia - On their first official case back on the X-Files, Mulder and Scully go undercover as a married couple at a prestigious planned community where several residents have recently disappeared after failing to comply with the rules and regulations.

Monday - A woman is forced to relive the same day over and over as she tries to prevent Mulder and Scully from being killed by her boyfriend during a bank robbery attempt; and as the events restart again and again, Mulder's sense of Deja-vu grows stronger.

Milagro - A writer living next to Mulder becomes obsessed with Scully and confesses to her that he is using her for a character in his novel. Scully finds herself strangely drawn to him even though he is now the prime suspect in the murder case that she and Mulder are investigating.

The Unnatural - Mulder meets with Agent Arthur Dales' brother (also named Arthur!) and is told a tale of a talented negro baseball player from Roswell, New Mexico in the 1940's who may have been an alien that ran away from his colony because of his love for the game.  (Written and Directed by David Duchovny).

By the end of this DVD set, you'll want to stay away from the Bermuda Triangle, stay clear of Area 51, be afraid of storms, refuse to go to the bank on Monday, and you'll be convinced that all of the greatest baseball players of all time are/were aliens.",1186099200,2,2883,4.580582524271844
1753823,5,B00006G8J8,"Remember before moving onto Season 6, you are supposed to watch X Files the movie first!

The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements since the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Season V actually has the bonus disc in with actual holder itself. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making an average of 25 episodes for most seasons. Some seasons have more or less than this figure. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame until Season 5. Season 5 is the first X-Files season to go Widescreen 1.78:1 and Season 6 retains this new widescreen setting.

X-Files: Season six has Mulder reconstructing a private X Files after the destruction of his affairs at the end of Season five. This is very much an alien invasion packed season. Mulder is back and believing that the hegemony and the alien colonization of planet Earth is not a con but a real threat and no longer sees it as just being a government propaganda vehicle. Scully's back to her critical ways. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) shows up again. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is back for more director of FBI lecturing the bizarre duo.  `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) makes a return. Special Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) has more screentime who alongside Agent Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) have been assigned the X Files which they ignore and censor. Apart from the main theme of an alien conspiracy the single episodes stand out as some of the funniest of the X Files seasons. Season six of the X-Files is mostly about - Alien hegemony, sonic death, time travel, altered states, demons, weather, ghosts, photography, poisons, astral projections, leviathans, killer dogs, fantasies, the lone gunmen, baseball playing aliens, hallucinogens and alien artefacts. The episodes are so good it is hard to pick out the best of the lot. The episode ""Rain Man"" is absolutely hilarious. ""Terms Of Endearment"" features Bruce Campbell who is excellent in everything and it is a pity they didn't keep his character on for more. ""Tithonus"", about a crime scene photographer, is quite creepy. ""SR 819"" is like the movie DOA featuring Skinner dying from a mystery illness. ""Arcadia"" is about a strict neighbourhood that hides a secret monstrosity. ""Agua Mala"" is one of the best monster hunting episodes to date. ""The Unnatural"" is the classic episode where a black baseball player is really an alien. Season 6 is worth every penny. If you thought the X Files couldn't get better then this one puts the X back in the files.",1183852800,3,5690,4.757085020242915

1753827,5,B00006G8J8,"I wanted to point out something technical about the slim set discs that I bought.  If you're looking for insight into the episodes or characters - please look elsewhere.

When I put the first disc of Season One into my DVD player, it started the ""loading"" process and gave me a disc error after about one minute.  Instead of cursing Fox (well, I did it later anyway) I turned the player off, leaving the disc inside.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my DVD player on and Viola!  I heard the X-Files theme and saw the menus (after the obligatory FBI copyright infringement warnings).

For those wondering, the DVD player in question above is a Philips Progressive Scan.  The same problem occurred on a newer Panasonic player.  No glitches materialized when I tried the discs on the Sony or AKAI players.  In all cases, I was eventually able to get to the episodes.  With the first two the screen sometimes showed up scrambled and the menus inaccessible.  On other occasions I was able to access a root menu similar to one you would see if you ""explore"" the DVD contents on a PC (Video_TS files, etc.), though the players would not load any content from these menus.  Speaking of PC viewing, I experienced no problems with any of the discs on my PC and all four programs my PC has to play DVDs functioned perfectly.

PLEASE DON'T READ INTO THIS TOO MUCH.  I don't work for Fox - I'm not trying to encourage sales of the more expensive sets.  This was just a personal experience I had, and it seemed to occur less frequently with Seasons 4 - 9.  My uneducated opinion: the equipment I have isn't top of the line, and maybe wasn't equipped to handle the way the content was compressed.  I was impressed that 4, sometimes 5 episodes were squeezed on one disc.  That's three - almost four hours of content.  I know - dual layer DVDs and blah, blah, blah.  But c'mon - even Lord of the Rings - Return of the King was issued on 2 discs!  (By the way, the content looked and sounded great.)

Another side note: Seasons 1 - 4 that I got were full frame, and 5 - 9 are widescreen.  At first I thought I had missed the option when purchasing these discs, but these are the only way I've found them at retail stores and online.  Nothing major; I just thought I was losing my mind at first.  (Which is still a possibility.)  I can't remember if they aired this way on television - I just noticed that the cinematography got revved up a bit starting with Season 5.  If this observation is incorrect, someone please feel free to correct me.

Okay.  If you have read this entire review give yourself a pat on the back, a cookie, I dunno - watch some old Doctor Who episodes or something.  A better price, better packaging, and better for you.  (They were giving out a carton of Morley's with the bigger sets, right?)  By the way - the 5 stars is based on my overall X-Files enjoyment.  Sure, there are episodes I can skip through.  But for me, it's good bang for the buck.  Enjoy!",1172361600,2,2967,4.381651376146789
1753828,4,B00006G8J8,"Season 6 follows directly after the movie.  The first episode is a miss if you ask me.  It picks up after the movie, and after the season 5 finale ""The End"".  Oddly though, the finale and the movie aren't connected very closely, so this episode combines elements from both that seem somewhat out of place and start off the season on a strange note.  From here, Mulder and Scully spend the majority of the season off the X-Files and under AD Kirsch, a jerk of a guy who has no faith at all in Mulder.  Season 6 is a slight improvement over season 5 if only for its longer length if you ask me.  The thing is, this is really the first season that shows a drastic contrast between the mythology and stand-alone episodes, the stand-alone ones showing a vast improvement over the mythology episodes.  For instance, there is a 2-parter that is a stand-alone (first for the series) called Dreamland (1 & 2).  It guest stars Michael McKean and is hilarious.  Chris Carter also steps in again with ""Triangle"", an episode that definately has his stamp on it.  Unfortunately, unlike the past, most of the mythology episodes just don't stand out with the rest of the episodes, and make this season somewhat unbalanced.  The sad thing is that the premiere, and finale (usually two of the best episodes of the series) are really somewhat of a convoluted mess in this season, and a big let-down.  Also, look for Bruce Campbell.  This DVD contains the 22 episodes from the series, but something different:  Since there are only 2 episodes on the last disc ALL THE SPECIAL FEATURES from the previous release are included here.  Documentary, deleted scenes, special effects clips, tv spots, dvd rom game, etc.  It's all here for the great price.

1753860,5,B00006G8J8,"So for about $35 compared to the earlier set price of $90, I'm getting better packaging, and I won't get the extra disc of bonus materials that the sets come packaged with. Um, I think I'll go ahead and get the new reissues.

I got lucky and purchased the original first season box set for less than $40 right here on Amazon. The packaging for these more expensive sets are downright atrocious. It's one of those fold out thingies that are annoying to unfold completely when you just want to get to one disc. I felt like I was trying to take apart complicated origami everyttime I opened the set. I think if you open the whole thing up completely, it's about the length of a pool table.

Now with these new sets, the discs come in individual slipcases, minimizing wear and tear on the box itself and making it loads easier to get the specific disc that you want to watch. Also, the bonus stuff wasn't really that in depth and I can do without it. Considering that you're getting better packaging with these new reissues, it's almost like you're paying upwards of $50 just to get some behind the scenes info on a show that is even better with the less you know about it.

At any rate, I'd suggest going with these new sets, unless you absolutely have to have the extra disc of features. The transfers are top notch and best of all, you can relive all your favorite episodes of Mulder and Scully for a much more reasonable price.",1168732800,4,1427,4.3977272727272725
1753861,3,B00006G8J8,"This review isn't for X-Files worshippers, but for casual buyers/viewers who are looking for some good thriller tv. This season of the famed conspiracy/occult tv show just isn't the place to start.

The X-Files is a direct descendant of Kolchak: The Night Stalker, with the latter's weird horror and cover-ups, its dark mood lightened by absurdity, its eccentric and alienated hero (with cranky-sympathetic supervisor), its dim view of authority, and its interest in social outcasts and techno-geeks. Stand-alone stories feature horror staples from vampires to natural mutations. Beware if you're not into law enforcement/military/government bashing, as this fuels much of the X-Files! The main 'overplot' (the ""mythology"") was a conspiracy in which a secret organization (the ""syndicate"") within world government covered up humanity's contacts with aliens since the Roswell crash. However in this season, having evidentally outlived its plot-usefulness, it is abrubtly terminated - with extreme prejudice!

Most viewers looked to the X-Files for taut, gripping horror/thrillers: stand-alones ending without easy answers and story arcs moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies. The odd black comedy had its place as well. If you're looking for THAT X-Files you'll be (mostly) disappointed with this season. It's extremely derivitive, self-parodic, and sometimes silly. There's also A LOT of coy toying with the chemistry between the agents. Although two episodes (Arcadia, Field Trip) are classics, I'd recommend any previous season (especially prior to 4) before these:

THE BEGINNING: Agent Spender gets the X files while child prodigy Gibson (Jeff Gulka) tracks a murderous ""Alien."" ***

DRIVE: Mulder has to get up to ""Speed"" to prevent hicks' heads from exploding. ***

TRIANGLE: Shipwrecked near Bermuda, Mulder finds a long-lost liner and some familiar faces in a WWII time warp. **

DREAMLAND I: Mulder and a sleazy techno-conspirator (comedian Michael McKean) swap bodies in fabled Area 51. **

DREAMLAND II: Scully notices something is amiss in the comedy's conclusion. ***

HOW THE GHOSTS STOLE CHRISTMAS: Lily Tomlin and Ed Asner costar in this mawkish haunted-house comedy. *

TERMS OF ENDEARMENT: Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell stars in this semi-comic tale of demons and dead babies. **

1753865,5,B00006G8J8,"I never got the chance to see the X Files when it aired originally. I tuned into it when it first aired in syndication on TNT around the 4th season and didn't think too much of it at first due to the silly stand alone episodes. I began watching it again a few months later and got caught up in it. Subsequently I ended up buying every season and paying top dollar for each. I was rather dismayed when the entire collection dropped dramatically in price a little more than 6 months later. That said, I don't regret having the complete X-Files collection as part of my DVD library. Everything about this series, from concept to elaborate sets and special effects was extraordinary. The conspiracy story line was done well enough to cause even a skeptic to question some things. A number of the paranormal episodes were astounding while some other episodes were absolutely hysterical. Some say it ran 2 seasons too long but the acting and scripts were even better after David Duchovny's departure. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's characters were a welcomed relief from the chronic tears of Gillian Anderson and mobid demeanor of David Duchovny for many fans of the show. The 2-part finale was a bit disappointing and it's difficult to tell if that was the fault of the writing team or David Duchovny's lack of interest in the project. Either way it's a piece of perfectly executed, mega budget, TV history and it shows in every episode.",1153440000,,1436,4.7023809523809526

1753867,5,B00006G8J8,"After the 5th season, the show moved from Vancouver, Canada to Los Angeles, effectively making their production easier. As such, you get a bit more ambitious episodes and some literal series classics as well as not really duds, just disappointing ones. The sets were originally on abnormally expensive sets and now the prices have been chopped in half considerably, making this a good buy for X-Files' fans.

The Beginning: The season premiere has another alien introduced in the film on the loose and someone from Mulder's past returns. 9/10
Drive: A pretty good episode as Mulder as to pull a ""Speed"" with a hostage who has to keep driving. 8/10
Triangle: A great episode has Mulder time travelling to be onboard the Queen Anne. Not only a great episode but a production tour-de-force as well. 9.5/10

Dreamland II: The conclusion that is just as funny as the first part. 8/10
How the Ghosts Stole Christmas: Mulder and Scully explore a haunted house. Great for the first half than it kind of loses steam. 7/10

The Rain King: Another so-so episode about a man who can seemingly control the weather. 6.5/10

S.R 819: Skinner gets infected by an old enemy. The episode is good but it doesn't have that lasting appeal to make it great. 7.5/10
Tithonus: A great episode where Scully finds a man who takes photographs of people who are just about to die. 8/10
Two Fathers: Part I finds Cassandra Spender returning and the implications that entails. Both parts are series classics. 9/10
One Son: The conclusion includes a pretty surprising end for the bad guys and a nice resolution to some of the mythology. 9/10
Aqua Mala: A decent episode where the agents get harassed by a sea creature during a hurricane. 7.5/10
Monday: A great episode where Mulder experiences a massive case of deja vu. 8.5/10
Arcadia: An absolutely great episode and funny as well. Mulder and Scully pose as a married couple in an Americana-like neighbourhood with a nasty creature around. 9/10
Alpha: For some reason, episodes centered around dogs, even nasty killer dogs don't work. (See: Smallville's cute Krypto episode too). 6.5/10

Milagro: A sharply-written but uninteresting episode centering around a writer who has a talent for really bringing his stories to life. Great performance by John Hawkes though. 7/10
Trevor: A man who can walk through walls is after something and he leaves his victims looking pretty nasty. It's alright. 7/10
The Unnatural: Quite funny episode centering around a black baseball player in Roswell.
Three of a Kind: A decent Lone Gunmen episode that's saved by Gillian Anderson's hilarious performance as a tipsy Scully. 7.5/10
Field Trip : I mean this: this is an X-Files classic with Mulder and Scully investigating skeletal remains that turns out to be pretty interesting. 9.5/10
Biogenesis: Artifacts which contain Biblical verses are found in Africa, which have an unusual effect on Mulder. 8/10

As you can see, there's some hits and misses throughout the season. While the season isn't a terrible season by any means, some of the episodes feel like they're missing that extra something to make it exceptional. Even season 3 standalones like War of the Coprophages or Pusher were great episodes that fit in with the rest of the season. Here it's as if some episodes are just slightly underwritten, excluding the aforementioned great ones.

And there is some great ones, one mention is of course Field Trip. One thing I love at the end is how Mulder actually solves it with the usual Scully rational scientific approach while Scully actually figures it out through thoughts, feelings and what she knows about people which is usually a Mulder thing. Is it beyond Clyde Brockman, Memento Mori, or One Breath? Possibly but it's certainly in the same level.

It's a hit or miss season but through it all it's a fairly solid season with very little outright stinkers and some geniune series classics. While it is best to start right from the beginning, it's still a great season overall.",1150156800,5,4219,4.926863572433192

1753889,5,B00006G8J8,"Just a technical note for those considering purchasing this reduced price set: the reissued X-Files Complete Season Six set INCLUDES NEARLY ALL THE EXTRAS FOUND IN THE MORE EXPENSIVE SET.

I'm as surprised as anyone, so I wanted to post a review making sure others knew as well.  The previous reduced-price Complete Season sets did NOT include all the extras (documentaries, TV promos, special effects shots w/commentary) though they DO contain what I consider to be the most important extras, the deleted scenes and episode commentaries.

The Season Six set, however, DOES contain all of these things, and you can find them on the sixth disc, after ""Field Trip"" and ""Biogenesis."" (Contents: ""The Truth About Season Six"" documentary, a collection of all the deleted scenes from the season w/commentary, 13 FX shots w/commentary, a character profile of CSM/C.G.B. Spender, a collection of FOX promos - very nice to have, these - and a DVD-ROM game.) I suspect it's because that disc only contains two actual episodes - there was enough room to put them all on without requiring an extra disc.  Given that this is the case, there's absolutely no reason whatsoever to waste money on the more expensive version. In fact, from an economic standpoint I kind of wonder WHY they put them here...strange business decision, though lord knows I'm not complaining.  Perhaps the more expensive set has an extra DVD not included here, but all the extras you might want are found on this cheaper edition.

Season Six was the last of the great X-Files seasons.  Though it's weaker than the Fifth Season (I personally feel the show never recovered from its move to Los Angeles), and isn't a patch on the incredible Second and Third seasons (which remain the show's peak in my opinion), it's still well worth owning.

It has an odd character, though: the writers made a bold decision, in ""Two Fathers""/""One Son,"" to wind up the main conspiracy arc that had been driving the show since the ""The Erlenmeyer Flask,"" and as a result the season is light on ""mythology"" episodes (only five, one of which, ""S.R. 819,"" is a standalone episode that always seemed peripheral to the main arc) and dangerously overloaded with comic ones. A full third of season is played either completely or mostly for laughs. Some of the comic episodes are worthy classics, like ""Triangle"" (the gimmickiness of which is saved by clever scripting, witty banter, and an irresistible World War II backdrop) and ""The Unnatural,"" David Duchovny's warm, glowingly sincere tribute to America's Pastime.  Others, however, are a bit twee: ""Dreamland"" attempts to extend its comic premise over two full hours and stretches itself thin in doing so, while ""Arcadia"" is essentially stunt casting (look, it's Mulder and Scully undercover as a married yuppie couple!) saved only by the interplay between Duchovny and Anderson.  Worst of all, some of the lighthearted episodes fall completely flat, like the excruciating ""How The Ghosts Stole Christmas"" (a cutesy mess that seems strikingly off-key for an X-File) and the dismally unfunny ""Rain King."" Moreover, the fact that almost all of these episodes were broadcast back-to-back-to-back on consecutive weeks made it seem that The X-Files was devolving into a parody of itself.

However, the season was almost fully redeemed by several truly memorable ""one-off"" episodes.  ""Drive"" is a tense, logical throwback to an earlier style of X-Files writing (most tonally reminiscent of time-is-running-out episodes like ""Darkness Falls"" and ""F. Emasculata"").  ""Tithonus"" manages the neat trick of being both frightening and moving as a meditation on the nature of death.  ""Agua Mala"" is a good old-fashioned gross-'em-out monster episode. Even better, ""Trevor"" summons the spirit of classic standalone installments from the earlier seasons, giving us a memorable villain with a neat paranormal power who acts like a credible human being.

And I really can't offer enough praise for the incredible ""Field Trip,"" one of the most inventively premised, tightly scripted, and psychologically penetrating episodes in the show's history.  It's inarguably the high point of the season, working both on its surface as an imaginative and faultlessly executed story, and on a deeper level as the finest-ever exploration of Mulder and Scully's partnership dynamic. Ultimately, this episode isn't about what Mulder and Scully discover on their 'field trip,' it's about what they believe about each other, the faith they repose in each other, and the way in which they subconsciously rely upon each other to balance out and redeem their respective weaknesses. (The wordless image that concludes the episode touchingly captures all of this.)  After six seasons and what was beginning to seem like sharply diminishing returns, ""Field Trip"" is a minor miracle, an hour that captures everything fans loved about the show: compelling sci-fi premises buttressed by the poignant, layered relationship between the two leads.  It stands alongside ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,"" ""Beyond The Sea,"" ""Pusher,"" and ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" as one of the five greatest non-mythology episodes of the entire series.

Your opinions may differ, though; with a show as consistently innovative and well-acted as The X-Files there's a lot of room for argument on these things.  I just want to make sure Amazon customers realize that they're getting full value on the money for this set, and that it's unique among the first six reduced-price seasonal sets in giving you that value.",1147478400,8,5541,5.197530864197531
1753890,5,B00006G8J8,This is a new version that just recently got released. These new boxsets don't have any of the special features that were included with the original version of the DVD boxsets; these new DVD sets only have the episodes.,1140912000,15,219,4.641025641025641
1753891,5,B00006G8J8,"The 6th year of THE X FILES ( 22 episodes airing in 1998-99 ) was the first and most consistently enjoyable of the four seasons filmed in Los Angeles. A palpable exuberance is on display throughout, which no doubt can be attributed to the excitement the cast and crew felt in working on the series in a new location. Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny give performances that are firm evidence of their commitment and in another move highlighting the change of venue, a number of familiar Hollywood character actors are featured. Far from being a gimmick, the casting is quite adept, the right people being chosen for the right roles ( just as it had been with the talented ""unknowns"" in Vancouver ). And, as in previous years, the considerable creative abilities of the directors ( especially Rob Bowman and the stalwart Kim Manners ) continued to be marshaled in service of Chris Carter's overarching aesthetic vision.

As with Season Five, the ""stand alone"" episodes shine ( only five episodes deal with the mythology ). Most of the scripts are of an inventive quality ( a number with comedic overtones ) and presented with the usual style and attention to detail that fans have come to expect of THE X FILES. One could be forgiven, however, for having a quibble with the original airing sequence in the first third of the season; far too many of the ""light"" scripts were shown consecutively, which lent an imbalance to a series that had previously distinguished itself with impeccable programming. In any case, Season 6 is the last in which ""stand alone"" episodes maintain a high level of consistency. The following year, many such scripts were noticeably derivative of earlier efforts and often failed to inspire a substantial emotional investment on the part of the actors ( especially so with regard to David Duchovny ).

Vince Gilligan continued his legacy as the most consistently creative writer on THE X FILES. As in Seasons 4 & 5, Gilligan contributed three solo efforts: ""Drive"", an exciting throwback to an earlier X FILES era ( wonderfully shot by Rob Bowman ). While ""Trevor"" is enjoyable, ""Tithonus"" is a masterpiece. Featuring dynamic performances by both Gillian Anderson and long time character actor Geoffrey Lewis, the episode ( inspired by a Greek myth ) is a bleak but ultimately redemptive musing on the ""curse"" of immortality.

Another dark script ( ""Milagro"" ) concentrates on an ""underground"" writer of Dostoevskian intensity who, in his obsession with Scully, shines with an intellectual brilliance and psychological insight that surpasses even Agent Mulder. ""Milagro"", in its spiritual magnitude, is one of the single finest episodes in X FILES history.

David Duchovny wrote and directed the superb ""The Unnatural"", a clever homage to America's favorite pastime that incorporates THE X FILES mythology in a humorous but respectful manner. The guest actor who plays the alien ballplayer is wonderful as is the well-known M. Emmett Walsh, serving double duty as actor and narrator.

Chris Carter weighs in as writer/director with the ambitious ""Triangle"", filmed ( using the unorthodox ""single take"" method ) aboard an actual ocean liner. A technical tour de force, ""Triangle"" is yet another pioneering X FILES episode that defies the usual constraints operating in television productions.

""Three of a Kind"" follows the exploits of the Lone Gunmen ""on assignment"" in Las Vegas. While not as good as ""Unusual Suspects"", this episode features a hilarious performance by Gillian Anderson as a ditzy (!) Agent Scully, temporarily deprived of her faculties by a surreptitiously administered chemical substance.

There are several old-fashioned ""monster of the week"" scripts in Season Six. In ""Agua Mala"", Chris Carter favorite Darren McGavin makes a guest appearance as retired FBI Agent Arthur Dales. Set in hurricane-drenched Florida, this episode is a fun send-up of B movies in the ""tentacled monster"" genre. Similarly, ""Arcadia"" mixes scares with light-heartedness, as Agents Scully and Mulder pose as a married couple in a gated suburban community.

A few sour notes are sounded: ""Rain Man"" is a unique idea for an X FILES story but its satire falls flat. ""Alpha"" is disappointing as is ""Terms of Endearment"" to an extent. Fortunately, even these ""lesser"" episodes are not catastrophic in their failures, a fate that would regretfully befall a number of scripts in Season Seven. The main defects in Season Six are located in the mythology storyline, its longstanding arc having reached its high point in prior years ( THE X FILES movie functioning as a grandiose large screen addendum ).

The opening episode ( ""The Beginning"" ) starts out promisingly enough, with a solid script that combines elements from the previous years cliffhanger as well as the ( then ) recently released film. The root of the problem lies in the mid season two parter ( ""Two Fathers"" / ""One Son"" ); its ""out in the open"" explanations regarding the conspiracy are strained and self defeating. Despite a good performance by Chris Owens as Agent Jeffrey Spender, this hastily prepared conclusion to the shadowy ""syndicate"" suffers from a lack of balance, improper pace and even poor editing in spots ( the jarring cut in the ""One Son"" car chase scene is egregious and very uncharacteristic of THE X FILES). Yet, in spite of these flaws, something very crucial was achieved. In essence, Chris Carter decided to ""amputate in order to save"", a calculated gamble that reinvigorated the mythology by cutting away the detritus of the old plotline. As a consequence, a reconstituted myth arc sprang forth in the excellent 6th Season cliffhanger titled ""Biogenesis"", the seed from which new storylines would grow in the years to come. Carter's bold move was especially important when one considers that, with a few notable exceptions, the new mythology arc ( intertwined with the Mulder/Scully relationship ) would turn out to be the main attraction in the three remaining seasons of THE X FILES.",1140393600,12,5993,5.069979716024341
1753892,5,B00006G8J8,"The last truly outstanding season of ""The X-Files"" the complete sixth season ties up a few loose ends but the series begins to unravel in the process. The seventh season despite some fine episodes would suffer. While the eighth season would get a jolt of much needed energy from Robert Patrick the writing still wasn't quite up to previous years. ""The X-Files: Fight the Future"" appeared during the summer between season five and six. The set, like the other reduced price sets from Fox, will include all the episodes from season six. You'll be able to access special features for respective episodes such as commentary, deleted scenes and international clips.

""The Beginning"" ties into the movie although the movie could stand independently on its own (which is just as well because despite some marvelous set pieces it basically was a rehashing of a number of alien movies). Mulder and Scully have been removed from the X Files and replaced by two new agents. One of the most interesting episodes includes ""SR 819"" where Assistant Director Skinner is black mailed into helping an old foe. Skinner has been infected with some mysterious organism that this other person can control to make Skinner do his bidding.

Bruce Campbell appears as a philandering husband in ""Terms of Endearment"". When his baby disappears and is apparently taken by a Demon Mulder and Scully are called in by local police to help with the case.  Campbell gives an excellent performance.

The two part ""Dreamland"" is terrific with a great guest performance by Michael McKean (""Spinal Tap""). A black ops agent switches bodies with Mulder freeing him from his shrewish wife and stuffy lifestyle. Suddenly Mulder becomes a wild and crazy guy.

The humorous but suspenseful ""Arcadia"" plants Mulder and Scully in suburbia playing a husband and wife in one of those ""planned communities"" ruled by an iron fist. Houses have to be a certain color, portable basketball hoops are forbidden and residents who step out of line mysterious vanish or are killed.

Duchovny's ""The Unnatural"" is a clever tale involving Arthur Dale (here played by character actor M. Emmett Walsh when Darren McGavin wasn't available in a truly X-files twist), racism and baseball loving aliens set before baseball was integrated. Dale is assigned to protect a African American baseball player who's life has been threatened as they tour the South.

""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"" is a funny and fun episode with guest appearences by Ed Asner and Lily Tomlin. Mulder decides to check out a haunted out on Christmas Eve and a reluctant Scully goes to check on him. The two get pulled into a surreal story which makes them doubt their own sanity.

For mythology fans the two episodes ""Two Fathers and ""One Son"" closes out the main conspiracy arc of the last five years. While threads remain (and show up in the fascinating ""Biogenesis"")many of the mysteries of the last five years are nicely wrapped up until we discover that there are aliens on Earth working beside us every day. To say more would spoil it and although it's unlikely you haven't seen it, I'd rather not spoil the conclusion and the set up for season seven.",1139616000,26,3166,4.904672897196262
1753893,5,B00006G8J8,"Being one of the late comers to the show, having started watching it around the 5th season, I decided to watch all the seasons in order, as I would understand it a lot more. Sitting through them all, I would have to say that season 6 is probably one of the finest, and most entertaining seasons of the lot. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson looks like they are really enjoying themselves in some of the most interesting episodes of the entire show.

The season kicks off with ""The beginning"" which is sort of a follow up to the movie. Unfortunately, the episode isn't one of my favourite openings, but it was exciting, as it showed the return of Gibson Praise, and also guest-starred one of the aliens from the movie. The next couple of episodes are some of the seasons' best. ""Drive"" is one of my personal favourites, as it is about a man who is forced to drive Mulder around the highways at high speed, or he will die. The opening scene to that episode is one of my favourites. ""Triangle"" is a very entertaining episode, in which Mulder crosses through the Bermuda triangle and gets caught up on a ship that was said to have disappeared during world war II. ""Dreamland I/Dreamland II"" is a very humorous episode, in which Mulder switces body with another man, after a UFO is seen flying over them. And ""How the ghosts stole christmas"" is an intertesting story were Mulder and Scully get locked in a house which is believed to be haunted by a married couple at Christmas eve.

Other good episodes include ""Two fathers/One son"" which basically closes of about 5 years of mythology in the show. The conclusion to the episode is breathtaking. ""Monday"" is another of my personal favourites, in which a woman has to relive the same day over and over again, until she can save Mulder and Scully from being killed by her boyfriend. ""Arcadia"" shows Mulder and Scully going undercover as a maried couple to try to investigate the disappearences of people in a small neighbourhood. It starts of very fun, but ends in a sort of disturbing way. ""The Unnatural"" is a great episode, in which a story is told about one of America's greatest baseball players being an alien. It includes a guest appearence by Brian Thompson as the alien bounty hunter. ""Field trip"" is a very unsettling and confusing episode, but very dream-like and it ranks as one of my personal favourite episodes ever.

A few episodes do let the season down: ""The rain king"" is a stupid episode which mostly revolves around a weather man trying to have the guts his long-time friend out. ""Alpha"" seemed like a good episode, about a killer dog on ther loose, but it just fell flat. ""Terms of endearment"" wasn't a bad episode, it was just average really, about a man who just wants to have a normal baby and he will do anything to make it happen. It does have a good guest-starring Bruce Campbell (The Evil dead films). ""Trevor"" was just boring, and it seemed familiar (""Sqeeze"" and ""Tooms"" from season 1).

The season-finale isn't the most exciting finale to me, as it didn't really have a good cliffhnager (the best ones would be Season 2's ""Anasazi"" and Season 4's ""Gethsamane"").

Still, this is probably one of the more experimental seasons of the show. Mixed with episodes of comedy, and some just straight-ahead horror stories.",1139184000,,3288,4.642611683848798
1753894,5,B00006G8J8,"THE X-FILES was one of the first television series to appear on DVD, but unfortunately 20th Century Fox didn't yet understand the market and as a result the sets were horribly overpriced, retailing usually for around $80 or $90 in most outlets, a price that meant that it wasn't going to be widely purchased.  Furthermore, the situation was made more complex by an influx of cheap Hong Kong pirated editions, which meant that anyone attempting to buy the series used over the Internet ran the risk of getting tacky editions that lacked special features and where the movements of the actors mouths failed to synch with the sound.  Thankfully, 20th Century Fox has finally corrected the situation by bringing out the original DVDs in a new Collector's edition.

Most serious fans of THE X-FILES, even those who believe, as I do, that the show was at least very good until the very end, that at some point the show failed to maintain the extremely high level it had been at from its beginnings in Season One.  My belief is that this happened in Season Six with the ending of the original Alien colonization mythology.  The problem was that with the cessation of the colonization arc, there was no successful rebuilding of the mythology aspect of the show to go along with the continuing excellent stand-alone episodes.  As any fan of the show knows, the first five seasons consisted of a blend of stand-alone episodes that did nothing to advance the alienation conspiracy arc with episodes that did advance that arc.  But that arc comes to an end in Season Six, and while they continued to have episodes that dealt with aliens and the governmental conspiracy to hide the truth about alien visitation, the show did not have a real arc until Season Eight with the introduction of the almost universally loathed Super Soldiers arc.  As mythology, Season Six was the last season to advance the original story.

Despite the end of the colonization arc, THE X-FILES in Season Six remains a remarkable show and contains a host of truly great episodes.  This was also the first season to be made in Hollywood rather than in Vancouver.  Some see this as featuring into the show's demise, but my own feeling is that the fault lies with the writing.  Though it never becomes anywhere close to being unwatchable, there simply aren't as many breathtaking episodes.  My own favorite pair of episodes is the delightful ""Dreamland"" parts 1 and 2.  Contacted by an anonymous Area 51 source Mulder and Scully go there only to have Mulder and his contact, played by Michael McKean, switch bodies when a spaceship causes a temporal distortion in their area.  The result is both a moving and funny pair of episodes in which the two switchees manage to completely mess up living the other's life, though it is funny when McKean's Mulder cleans out the bedroom that had been used as a storage closet (the show's fans all know that Mulder merely slept on his couch) buys a water bed, a mirror for the ceiling, and other accoutrements to turn Mulder's apartment into a bachelor pad.  ""Two Fathers"" and ""One Son"" bring the original mythology arc to a close, and while they are wonderfully satisfying and in no sense a disappointment, their cessation left the series nowhere to go.  All in all, while this was still a series of the highest quality, by X-FILES standards it is a very slight disappointment.  It was the first season in which it failed to maintain its own high standards.  The good news is that even in the weakest episodes of the season, the show continued to surpass almost everything else that was taking place on television.

Perhaps because of the end of the original mythology arc, Season Six saw the repressed romance between Scully and Mulder come a bit more to the surface.  There is no explicit romance, but their relationship becomes increasingly flirtatious and Scully, usually serious to an extreme, starts smiling a great deal more around Mulder.  The biggest tease might be in ""The Unnatural,"" where Mulder, arms around Scully, tries to give her a feel for swinging a baseball bat.

I honestly do not believe that there are any seasons of THE X-FILES that can be construed as anything short of Must See.  Although in Season Six it finally fell slightly below the astonishing standard it set in its first five seasons, it remains riveting television.  And now that it is available at a completely affordable price, there is no reason for any fan not to own their own copy of each season.",1139011200,7,4486,4.75741935483871
1753895,5,B00006G8J8,"Nominated for 12 Golden Globes and 61 Emmys, including 4 for Outstanding Drama Series, The X-Files is one of the world's most popular science-fiction drama shows. Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...

The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...

The X-Files (Season 6) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the season premiere ""The Beginning"" in which, much to Mulder's dismay, the Office of Professional Conduct has refused to put he and Scully back in charge of The X-Files project, opting to replace them with Agents Fowley and Spender instead. Nevertheless, the two continue their work off duty while their latitude within the agency shrinks... Other notable episodes from Season 6 include ""Rain King"" in which Mulder comes to believe that a weatherman's emotions are effecting the weather in a small rural town, and ""Alpha"" in which an anthropologist discovers the existence of an extinct canine species is Asia and brings it to America where it escapes and begins randomly killing people...

1753896,4,B00006G8J8,"After the success of the X-Files feature film, everyone was ready for the new season of X-Files. But from the first frame we see of the first episode of the season we realize something is different. And that something is the show moved to L.A. This had several fans disgruntled. It had them disgruntled for the same reason more people would be in season 8. There was a change. Not that that was a bad thing. I mean Vancouver was great, but after 5 seasons there it was starting to get old. I actually think that if they would've continued filming in Vancouver the show might have acutally ended after season 7. The episodes of season 6 are lighter, sillier, and have a stronger focus on the M&S relationship. Below as always is a short episode guide of some of the seasons best. SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!!!!!!!

The Beginning: Mulder and Scully return from Antarctica to discover that no one believes their story. They are put off the X-Files, and reassigned. But they realize that they still have work to do, and the reappearance of Gibson Praise confirms that.

Triangle: Mulder is stuck in a time warp on a Nazi ship in 1940.

Dreamland: Mulder swaps bodies with a MIB. Mulder tries to get his old body back, but the MIB doesn't want a thing to change.

How The Ghosts Stole Christmas: Mulder takes Scully to a house he believes is haunted. The ghosts living there try and get M&S to kill each other.

S.R. 819: Skinner is infected with a disease that is rapidly killing him, and M&S search for what happened to him, and who caused it.

Tithonus: Scully is partnered with a Alfred Fellig, a man who mysteriously shows up at a crime scene as soon as it happens.

Two Fathers: Cassandra Spender reappears, and gives Mulder startling information concerning the impending alien colonization.

Arcadia: M&S are back on the X-Files and must go undercover as husband and wife to investigate the deaths of several residents in a seemingly perfect town.

Milagro: Mulder's neighbor becomes obsessed with Scully, and Scully is drawn to him even though he is a murder suspect.

Field Trip:a couple is found on a mountainside as nothing but skin and bones, and Mulder thinks paranormal phenomena could account for it.

Biogenesis: an artifact with strange writings on it is discovered of the coast of Africa, and Mulder thinks it may hold the key to all life on Earth. However, Mulder begins going crazy, stopping him from giving out his theory.

Some great stand alone episodes throughout the season definentely help the series transition to L.A. However, even I have to admit sometimes the show did get a little to light. Never the less, a great season.",1118966400,2,2639,4.700650759219089
1753897,5,B00006G8J8,"Among X-philes, there are some who see Season 6 as the beginning of the end for THE X-FILES. On the urging of star David Duchovny, the crew relocated their base of operations from Vancouver to Los Angeles, and the move did seem to spark a different kind of spirit to subsequent X-FILES episodes. Not only was the look much bolder and brighter than the usual dark lighting of previous episodes; many of the episodes themselves started to veer into lighthearted comedy rather than the creepiness or dark humor of episodes like ""Squeeze"" or ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose.""

Some, of course, saw it as a sign that the creative minds of THE X-FILES were running out of creative juice. But, having revisited these 22 episodes recently, I believe that that is far from the case. My final impression of this great TV show's Sixth Season is of a wildly inventive series of episodes that was a step up from what I thought was a comparatively lackluster Season 5.

Sure, there are not as many of those memorably freaky monsters of seasons past: certainly, the rather tame tulpa of ""Arcadia"" is no match for, say, the frightening Flukeman of Season 2's ""The Host."" But, instead of creeping us out on a consistent basis, Season 6 delights us with its ingenuity. Would THE X-FILES of Season 2 even countenanced an episode like this season's delightful ""Triangle,"" which throws a desperate Mulder (David Duchovny) into a time warp in which he is stuck on a British luxury liner during WWII? Instead of another depressing holiday episode like Season 5's ""Christmas Carol,"" writer-director Chris Carter treats us with the heartwarming (despite the spooks) ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas,"" with Ed Asner and Lily Tomlin as a husband-and-wife pair of ghosts. And Season 6 comes up with the first comic two-parter, ""Dreamland""/""Dreamland II,"" a funny body-switching romp guest-starring Michael McKean as a loser MIB who switches bodies with Mulder by accident, and loves it.

That's just the tip of the iceberg, though, with the creative treats offered by Season 6. It may not be as creepy as some may prefer, but it is, in many ways, even wilder than anything offered in the first five seasons.

But, of course, those are just the standalone episodes. The alien mythology also sparks back into life, after the lackluster mytharcs of Season 5. The centerpiece, of course, is ""Two Fathers""/""One Son,"" a convoluted and compelling two-parter that the FOX network touted as ""Full Disclosure,"" as the answer to most of the questions posed by these mythological epiosodes. As usual with Chris Carter, it wasn't exactly that. Nevertheless, it did bring all the plot threads about alien colonization and warfare to a reasonable conclusion (or so it seemed at the time).

""Two Fathers""/""One Son"" left the door open for a new thread to emerge in the Season 6 finale, ""Biogenesis."" ""Biogenesis"" is unusual in that, instead of dabbling in confusing conspiracies or faceless aliens, it takes a more philosophical angle in exploring its new thread: the question of whether life truly originated on this planet or not. In the process, Mulder finds himself hearing things in his head and going slowly insane, and Scully (Gillian Anderson) finds herself in the midst of a biological mystery that has her stunned by the implications of her findings. Of course, most of ""Biogenesis"" is gripping and fascinating, as most of these big X-FILES mythology episodes are. At this point, though, many X-philes---myself included, started to feel that Carter and co. were running on fumes by this point, trying to stretch out a mythology that had already run its course. So, for all the solemnity of ""Biogenesis,"" the episode felt, to me, a little too much like...I guess, padding of sorts.

Still, those reservations are not enough to mar a strong season of episodes, one that almost consistently surprised and delighted, especially with its standalone episodes. There are so many strong ones in Season 6 that picking a favorite is almost impossible. Still, for my money, the most memorable standalone is not the wacky ""Triangle"" or David Duchovny's terrific writing-directing debut ""The Unnatural."" No, my personal favorite is ""Tithonus,"" a moving episode about a weary old man who is simply unable to die, despite his numerous attempts attacting the attention of Death. Written by Vince Gilligan, always one of the show's strongest writers, it has an excellent performance by Geoffrey Lewis to recommend it. Lewis vividly conveys Alfred Fellig's weariness simply through his low, lazy, unemphatic phrasing; he somehow makes the character sympathetic in spite of his cynicism. ""Tithonus"" is a thoughtful episode about death that, thankfully, never becomes overly religious or preachy; you may not agree with Fellig's assertion that ""75 years is enough,"" but you'll think about how much you value life nevertheless.

Other highlights include ""Drive,"" ""S.R. 819,"" ""Monday"" (derivative of GROUNDHOG DAY, I know, but entertaining nonetheless), ""Milagro,"" and the fascinating (if overrated) mindbender ""Field Trip."" And kudos to David Duchovny for coming up with the most delightful Mulder-and-Scully byplay in THE X-FILES since their first meeting in ""Pilot""; their priceless first scene together in ""The Unnatural"" alone is worth the price of this box set.

Thus, Season 6 of THE X-FILES, an inventive, consistently entertaining season that gives lie to those who see the beginning of the end in this set of episodes. It may not recall the creepy glories of earlier seasons; still, taken on its own terms, the Sixth Season is, overall, a terrific achievement. Highly recommended.",1116633600,5,5631,5.113043478260869
1753898,4,B00006G8J8,"Following hot on the heels of the movie, Series 6 is remarkable for the switch from Vancouver to the US.

There was quite a change in the film quality, it's noticably lighter, friendlier, and lost the familiar "" X-File Creepiness""

Despite this, the quality of the writing and casting continued throughout the season, the changes of location were quite refreshing, and on the whole the stories highly interesting.

Highlights for me included the following:

""Dreamland 1 & 2"" Hilarious in parts, this is the far fetched ( aren't they all...) story of Mulder changing places with an Area 51 employee. The story was highly interesting, exploring the UFO conspiracy from yet another angle.

"" S R 819"" was another high quality, taut thriller involving Skinner, who is infected with a mysterious disease, which keeps the viewer guessing. Excellent tension.

"" Two Fathers"" & ""One Son"" , although interesting, really ended the mythology concept for me. The mythology episodes were never the same after the syndacate was killed off in these ones. However, these episodes are very thought provoking, and left Carter room to move in another direction.

"" Monday"" Groundhogdayish, Mulder keeps waking up repeating the same day, over and over.

"" Alpha"" I loved this, although many bagged this one. Mulder & Skully investigate a wild dog that supposed attacks and kills people. Lovely creepy feeling akin to earlier seasons.

"" Trevor"" Interesting story of a man who can move through walls- great special FX

"" Three of a kind"" Excellent Lone Gunman episode set in a casino in Las Vegas. And yes, the babe IS hot!

"" The unnatural"" this had a great feel about it too- recounts the story of an African American baseball player who actually was an alien. Love the atmosphere they managed to create in this episode, especially on the bus travelling.

"" Biogenesis"" Superb cliff hanger to end the season, with Scully travelling to Africa to investigate a mysterious relic.

X-Files at it's brilliant best!

The season did contain a couple of stinkers, as was the case by this stage of the X-Files- none more so than "" Field Trip"" & "" Agua Mala"", but hey nothing's perfect.

Once again, more lightheartness is prevailing through the season, with Duchovy giving just the first small hints that he's had enough of the Mulder character.

Despite this, overall it's a show that more than worth watching, with the usual extra's that form part of this set- this is definitley an X-Files season that won't disappoint!

The Quality is still there, and worth adding to your collection

1753929,5,B00006G8J8,"Season 6 had a lot of opportunity to go wrong. Coming straight off the back of a very successful motion picture with an entirely new crew and shooting location, it was clear that people were worried that the magic formula that had made Seasons 1-5 so excellent might be lost. If you judge it by the first 6 episodes, they could have been right.. but they weren't.

""The Beginning"" attempts to link the film into the series, and more or less accomplishes this goal (but doesn't really add anything to the mythology), and ""Drive"" is acceptable despite lacking any real drama. But ""Triangle"", ""Dreamland I & II"" & ""How The Ghosts Stole Christmas"" are the worst the X-Files had been up to this point. The fact that in the DVD extras these three episodes  are not praised for being well written but for how they've been shot says a lot.

While ""Triangle"" may be very cleverly filmed, it's a completely pointless and meaningless story that doesn't even make sense within itself (why are people from Mulder's life on this ship, as other people, for example?).

""Dreamland I & II"" takes all the most annoying parts about all the previous comedy episodes, stretches them out over 2 hours and tries to attach a serious story to it, with a solution that doesn't work anyway (SPOILER: if time hasn't really been turned back and everything did occur, as would be suggested by Mulder's apartment still being redecorated, then how come NO ONE asks where they've been for the last few days and there's no repercussions to their actions?).

""How The Ghosts Stole Christmas"" is basically just a way to do an episode without spending much money (they almost come right out and say as much in the DVD extras). Badly paced, pointless.. just downright bad.

However, once we get to ""Terms Of Endearment"", the old X-Files magic seems to be back, and every episode from here to the end is excellent, sometimes the best this show has ever been. Highlights for me are ""S.R. 819"", ""Tithonus"" and ""The Unnatural"", but they're all excellent.

Of special mention has to be the two parter ""Two Fathers""/""One Son"" - these episodes are so important that they're worth the price of this set alone. The mythology that has been built over the last 6 years ends here. If you had been put off buying this show's box sets through a fear of getting into a story without a satisfying conclusion, as I had, you could end your collection here with One Son if the rest of the seasons don't interest you. Its that big.

Of course, having effectively ended the most important part of the whole series, they needed to find a new mythology, which is begun in Biogenesis and presumably carries over into the final 3 seasons - therefore it's probably best to leave discussion of that for their reviews.

Overall, despite a very bad start, the good outweighs the bad by being not just good, but superb. Buy this.",1110067200,,2861,4.649504950495049
1753930,5,B00006G8J8,"A strong sixth season as ""The X-Files"" continued to stroll along in top form. Chris Carter, Frank Spotnitz, Vince Gilligan and the rest of the writing/directing/producing crew created a number of strong memorable episodes during season six. While the mythlogy episodes are pretty terrific, the ones that stand out in my mind are the individual stand alone episodes. ""The Beginning"" manages to fit events from the movie into the series quite neatly so if you haven't seen the film, you'll be able to keep track of much of the action.

Among my favorites this season included ""Terms of Endearment (featuring Bruce Campbell as, well, kind of a devlish guy),the unusual ""Triangle"" where suddenly Mulder finds himself as a Nazi officer during World War II in a time warp where all the various characters from the series show up. The Duchovny penned ""The Unnatural"" where we discover that the best player in baseball didn't quite fit into any league at all. M. Emmett Walsh guest stars (Darren McGavin wasn't available to reprise his part). The tongue-in-cheek two parter ""Dreamland"" is charming and funny. Here Mulder switches bodies with a government agent who's in charge of black ops (and who suspiciously looks like Michael McKean from ""Spinal Tap"") The Lone Gunmen make an appearence in ""Three of a Kind"" revisitng where Byers finally meets up with the mysterious Suzanne again (by the way ""The Long Gun Men"" 13 episode first season is coming to DVD shortly as well).The Suspenseful ""Drive"" and cliff hanger ""Biogenesis"" where Mulder seems to be losing his mind and the only clue is an alien artifact uncovered along the coast of Africa. This fine episode leads into the two part conclusion of season seven.

With season six Scully moved from role of doubter to a believer of sorts. While season seven had its high notes (most notably the two part opener), season six was the last most consistent season of the series (although season seven was exceptionally good as well).

All in all, a great season that continued to keep audiences spellbound.",1105228800,,2046,4.941860465116279
1753931,5,B00006G8J8,"Season 6 was pretty good, though not as intense as the classics from seasons 1-3.  I love some of the comic episodes: Dreamland I and II, How the Ghosts Stole Christmas, Arcadia, and Three of a Kind.  ""Field Trip"" was odd.  ""The Unnatural"" was so, so.  David Duchovny does a much better job with ""Hollywood AD"" in Season 7.  The stand-alones were compelling.  It's amazing how Brian Kranston can disappear into his guest-star role in ""Drive.""  It's hard to believe it's the same Brian Kranston who plays Malcolm's father, Hal, in ""Malcolm in the Middle.""  Well, I won't comment on every single episode here.  I just think this season is another good contribution to the series, especially for those collecting X-Files episodes.  If you're just starting to collect X-Files, I highly recommend Seasons 1-4.  Those have amongst some of the best episodes of this entire series.  For X-Files regulars: get this item if you want to continue following the storyline all the way through.  Although, I'd suggest you watch the X-Files movie first because Season 6 is a continuation of that.  If you don't watch the movie, you're going to be confused about the first episode.",1104278400,,1164,4.872448979591836
1753932,5,B00006G8J8,"Up until a few months ago, I never watched a single episode of the X-Files. However, now that the DVD sets have been reduced in price, I had the opportunity to start watching the show. Right off the bat, I was hooked immediately and with each passing season the show became established in my eyes as one of the best and most addictive sci-fi shows ever created. After seeing the first five seasons, I didn't think that season five could be topped, because it did not have one bad episode. I was also somewhat skeptical about season six, because of how many fans that said the show went downhill after the show left Vancouver to be shot in Los Angeles. I just finished with the sixth season, and it feels like the move to L.A. was a blessing in disguise. The sixth season is without a doubt the best season I have seen so far.
The thing that suprised me the most about season six, was the fact that there were only three mythology episodes in ""Two Fathers"", ""One Son"", and ""Biogenesis"". Season six was the first season to be built almost solely upon stand alone episodes. However, the three episodes did such a wonderful job with the mythology of the show, that three episodes was all that season six needed. In fact, a season that was mainly comprised of  stand alone episodes was definately a nice change of pace. Season six is filled with some of the best episodes of the entire show like ""Triangle"", ""Dreamland"" pts 1&2, ""Monday"" and ""The Unnatural"". Other episodes worth mentioning are ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"" in which two ghosts try and convince Mulder and Scully to kill each other, ""Arcadia"" in which Mulder and Scully pose as a newly married couple, and ""Drive"" in which Mulder is trapped in a car with a man who forces Mulder to drive at high speeds to suppress a fatal ear condition.
Overall, season six of the X-Files managed to be even better than the fifth season and is now my favorite season. With top notch mythology episodes and fantastic stand alone episodes, this DVD set would be worth owning just for the season itself. However, the extras are also great as well. You get two featurettes, deleted scenes, commentary on ""Triangle"" and ""Milagro"", and more.

In this season, we start pretty much where the movie left off. And we also have a conclusion to the syndicate, and dive deeper into the conspiracy of Mulder's sister. We also find out more about the alien rebels. Lastly, we end the season with a great cliffhanger that takes the season in a new direction, dealing with an interesting (although highly implausible) take on the genesis of life on this planet.

1753934,5,B00006G8J8,"So many people constantly bang on about the quality of the humour and light in season seven. The fact is, is that season six is as light and funny as the X Files ever should have got.
This is an incredibly enjoyable season. I can't name one episode off the top of my head that left me miserably awaiting next weeks to top it. (Although I'm sure there were a few.)
If the X files had carried on for however many years, this is how it should have been done. The show had lost it's original strengths by now, (Which included gathering the public togethor in to an orgy of Alien fascination) but the show was just simply fun.
By season six I no longer tuned in to find out whether Mulder would find his sister or Aliens would be recovered, but I wanted to see what adventure Mulder and Scully would be on next.
There was a perfect formula to this season that I just can't put my finger on, but it's a shame that season seven came along and blew the whole thing to pieces.
There isn't really much else I can say. This season isn't really better than previous seasons (Well it's better than two in my opinion) but it is different. It took a neat little turn and every episode felt like a cool interesting movie, that quite literally anyone could have watched whether they had ever seen the X Files before or not.
It's a shame it didn't stay like this.
Now I've seen all the following seasons, I actually think that the kid who says 'I made this' over Ten Thirteen Pictures is Chris Carter. You'd either have to be very young, or a complete moron to dump the whole show down the toilet like he did.",1080000000,3,1591,4.254125412541254
1753935,4,B00006G8J8,"For five seasons, The X-Files was one of the best shows on television, and the feature film ""Fight the Future"" was similarly excellent.  With the sixth season and the show's move to LA, however, The X-Files became merely good, not great.
In my opinion, the chief problem with Season 6 (and 7, for that matter) is the prescence of some poorly executed ""humorous"" episodes.  In the early seasons, there would every so often be an episode that was funny and tongue-in-cheek, without losing that X-Files feel.  With Season 6, however, such episodes ceased to be genuinely funny, and became simply silly and wacky, providing little laughter that isn't forced.  This season's worst offender is ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas,"" in which Mulder and Scully are trapped on Christmas Eve in a haunted mansion, whose ghostly residents wish to goad the FBI agents into a murder-suicide - by spouting pop psychology at them.  Episodes that aren't mainly spoofs are also harmed by the silliness.  ""Agua Mala,"" in which a hurricane lets a sea monster loose in an apartment building, could have been a genuinely creepy episode, except for the fact that the building's tenants are all trite stereotypes.
While there were problems, the good outweighed the bad in this season.  The mythology episodes continued to be superb, especially ""Two Fathers""/""One Son,"" a two-parter which essentially brings closure to the ""Mytharc"" running through the past five seasons.  The season's only successfully humorous episodes are also mythology-related, namely the two-part ""Dreamland,"" in which Mulder and an Area 51 operative switch bodies, and ""The Unnatural,"" which tells the story of a star baseball player who is in fact an alien.  The season finale ""Biogenesis,"" which introduces a new stage of the mythology, is an intriguing episode, but its continuation in Season 7 is sadly disappointing.
This season also featured some excellent stand-alone episodes.  Especially good are ""Drive,"" in which a mysteriously ailing man must keep driving - or his head will explode, ""Alpha,"" a werewolf story with a twist, and ""Field Trip,"" in which Mulder and Scully are trapped by a hallucinogenic giant fungus.
Casual viewers may wish to stick with the first five seasons, which constitute the best of the series.  Season 6 does, however, contain some really excellent episodes, and true fans will find plenty to enjoy.

The alien virus infects humans developing an extraterrestrial biological entity within the human organism and while in the 1st half of the season Mulder and Scully are suspende from the x-files they investigate some of the most interesting scary stories.

Clairvoyant child Gibson is brought back as well, but all this paves the way for ""Two Fathers"" and ""One Son""; episdoes which fully flesh out the mythology by revealing just about everything X-Files viewers have waited to see since the show began.  Other standout episodes include one shots ""Triangle"" which finds Mulder back in time on a Nazi infested ocean liner, ""Terms of Endearment"" which guest stars a demonic Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell, the Christmas inspired episode ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"", and the two parter ""Dreamland"" in which Mulder switches bodies with Michael McKean.  The finale ""Biogenesis"" finds Scully becoming more of a believer while Mulder begins to seemingly lose his mind.  All in all, Season 6 was the last brilliant season of the series, and the first to be shot in Hollywood since moving from Vancouver.",1064793600,5,1139,5.102150537634409
1753958,5,B00006G8J8,"With the success of The X-Files theatrical release, new fans, along with fans who had been with the show since the beginning, eagerly awaited the premiere of the sixth season of ""The X-Files."" With the new season also came a new shooting location as the show moved from rainy and picturesque Vancouver, Canada to sunny and modern Los Angeles, California. Fans who feared the new location would clash with the show's trademark atmosphere of mystery and suspense, aided greatly by the often and damp and cloudy weather conditions present in Vancouver, need not have worried. They soon discovered the supernatural is just as spine-tingling in the full light of day as it is on a dark and rainy night.

With Season 6 of The X-Files, FBI Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) return from Antarctica to find their story of the deadly virus, alien spaceship, and subsequent escape disbelieved and their positions in the X-Files taken over by Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). Although forced to work apart, the agents continue to secretly information that passes through the X-Files office or comes to them clandestinely.

With Season 6 of The X-Files there aren't many mythology episodes. Once they come along though, they are true treats for fans. The first mythology episode is called ""The Beginning,"" and is also the first episode of the season. The episode pulled in more than 20 million viewers when it premiered on the FOX Network on November 8th 1998 - amazingly, this isn't the top-rated episodes of the show's entire run, proving its phenomenal popularity. In the episode the X-Files is re-opened, but not with Mulder and Scully. Mid-season we see the amazing two-parter ""Two Fathers/One Son."" These two episodes reveal almost everything that has happened over the past five years on the show. Die-hard fans will love it. No disappointment at all.

The season ends with the fantastic episode ""Biogenesis,"" in which Mulder and Scully are affected in different ways by a rubbing taken from an apparent spacecraft that has emerged through the sea on South Africa's Ivory Coast. Said to be the word of God, Scully embarks on one of her most dangerous and challenging cases to date - all while trying to look after a deranged Mulder.

Season 6 does not feature the best mythology episodes of the show's entire run, but what it does feature (and what makes it one of the best seasons) is some absolutely amazing stand-alone episodes. I am now choosing to mention only the cream of the crop, but these that I list below are all pretty amazing in themselves. The season contains the episodes ""Dreamland/Dreamland II,"" ""Terms Of Endearment,"" ""The Rain King,"" ""S.R. 819,"" ""Tithonus,"" ""Arcadia,"" ""The Unnatural,"" ""Three Of A Kind"" and ""Field Trip."" The only real boring episodes of the season are ""Alpha"" and ""Trevor.""

In ""Drive,"" Mulder is taken hostage in a car and forced to drive across America by an aggressive man who believes his head will explode if the car slows down - just like his wife. Meanwhile, Scully tries to determine what is causing this strange event. ""Triangle"" is perhaps the best comedy episode of the show's entire run. Filmed in four separate takes, the episode sees Mulder accidentally travel back to 1939 and get trapped on a W.W.II ship after he enters the Bermuda Triangle. Split-screens and a Scully/Skinner kiss is enough to make this a fantastic episode! In ""How The Ghosts Stole Christmas,"" Mulder and Scully find themselves trapped inside a haunted house on Christmas Eve, where an old married couple play cruel tricks on them! It sounds wacky, and it is - but in a brilliant way.

""Agua Mala"" is a fantastic stand-alone episode where Mulder and Scully take a trip to Florida and are caught up in a hurricane. They must deal with a deadly sea creature that is killing off a number of hotel residents. ""Monday"" is an episode that will blow your mind with its detail. A Monday morning repeats itself over and over, which always ends in Mulder being shot and Scully being blown up in a bank. Mulder must remember all this before it happens - weird and fantastic. ""Milagro"" is a brilliant episode where a man writes horrific stories that come true - all involving the removal of a human heart. His fascination and attraction to Scully gets her into dangerous circumstances.

I don't usually mention the Special Features on The X-Files or Buffy Box Sets, as I feel it is irrelevant to the things I focus on writing about - the actual episodes. However, with the Season 6 of The X-Files, I have to make an exception! Let me first say that the artwork is awesome; a superb gold and black cover slips over the box contained within, which opens up a number of times to display all six discs. The images are wonderful, and quotes from certain decorate the design. There are too many special features contained to mention, but I'll just say that you'll be very happy with them!

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

I purchased this box set on DVD without seeing any of the episodes on TV beforehand, so I was taking a bit of a risk. I know now, however, that it was a risk worth taking as I absolutely adore Season 6 of The X-Files. Season 2 has always been my favourite season of the show, but Season 6 nearly changed all that! Not quite though. All in all, this DVD collection is definitely - like so many others have said - a must have.",1063152000,2,5401,4.755602988260406
1753959,4,B00006G8J8,"This season really showed that the writers were getting a little bored with the storylines. I don't know you said this but ""a bad season of the X-files is better than a good season of most shows on television.""",1062720000,,210,4.410256410256411
1753960,5,B00006G8J8,"This is the season where they moved to L.A. The wet, green, shadowy and cloudy environment of Vancouver was lost... One must give credit to the L.A crew because they were able to maintain the look of the series: it kept being and feeling like The X-Files. This season has many light episodes (particularly in the beginning of the season), so that is minus for me, because they were not as clever as the ones from previous seasons, and there were too many of them for my taste. In the other hand, the main mythology came to an end around episodes 11 and 12, and they were not what I expected. Mulder and Scully had not much to do in them, and the center seemed to be around Jeffrey Spender and Diana Fowley. Why not integrate the main characters more in such important episodes? even with these problems, I recognize that they are more about my own personal likes. The X-Files gave still some of the most interesting episodes in this season.
After the movie, the FBI reopens the X-Files, but in The Beginning Mulder and Scully must struggle to show that they are the right people to conduct these investigations. The first half of the season we see Mulder and Scully assigned to background checks while Spender and Fowley conduct the X-Files investigations. This half of the season includes great episodes such as Drive (if Mulder reduces the speed of the vehicle, the head of a racist could explode), Tithonus (a man is searching the Death through photographs and Scully could end up in one of his photos), Triangle (the kind-of- no cuts episode in which Mulder goes back in time) and SR 819 (Skinner is infected by someone, and while they investigate how senator Matheson and a resolution are involved in this, Skinner's hours are about to finish)... Then we have Terms of endearment (good, not much, but entertaining: a demon wants to have human babies), The rain King (too too light for me... too much, sorry), Dreamland (this comedic episode in which Mulder changes bodies with an Area 51 employee, lacks the edge of the third season comedic episodes and the clever humor from Small Potatoes and Bad Blood).
In Two Fathers and One Son, Cassandra Spender is returned in between the flames of the rebels, who have just burnt alive the doctors that were operating on her. She has become the first real human-alien hybrid, but she has come in the worst posible moment because the rebels' operations threaten to expose the syndicate's secret agenda: to produce a human hybrid inmune to the effects of the black oil. The CSM and the syndicate decide eventually to bring forth the colonization. Fowley helps CSM execute his plans while Spender finds out the truth not only about aliens, but about how his own father has tortured his mother through years and years of abductions and experiments. Finally, the syndicate meets in a hangar in order to meet the aliens and give Cassandra up... and save theirselves. This long description and no Mulder and Scully? well, that's how it is... it is a good plot, but where are the main characters? Well, Mulder keeps thinking Diana is good and Scully losing her temper (along with us) with Mulder's stubborness. In the end, Mulder and Scully are reassigned to The X-Files while CSM shoots his own son in the very same office where Mulder has worked for seven years.
The second half of the season is less light than the first, but even so, it has some very regular episodes, like Alpha (a werewolf with a twist, but nothing special), Arcadia (for shippers this is an excelent episode because Mulder and Scully infiltrate a community as a young couple, while they face a garbage monster) and Agua Mala (the agents face a creature from the deep ocean, which surfaces due to a tropical storm). But there are many noticeable episodes: Monday (can you imagine living a Monday over and over? And on top of that the day in which you are blown up in an explosion?), Trevor (a man walks through matter burning it behind him... he is looking for what is his... is it money? is it revenge? is it a second chance with what he has long lost?), Field Trip (while living hallucinations, Mulder and Scully are being devored by a giant fungus... how can you escape from what is built to seem real to you in a condescendent way... to the extent of insanity?). The unnatural is one of those strange X-Files... but I didn't like the tone at the end of the episode... it was too lighthearted. Three of a kind is another Lone gunmen centered episode, but it doesnt work as well as Unusual suspects (okay... it is always a good thing to see Scully acting weird and funny).
Finally, the two really great episodes of this season are: Milagro, one of the best of the whole series if you ask me. Events are an excuse for writer to get close to Scully... this is a mesmerizing, bewitched, haunting episode with a wonderfull score from Mark Snow. And Biogenesis: this is a great season finale. While Mulder goes mad because of the inprint of an artifact, Scully ends up going to Africa only to discover the one thing that can turn her into a believer.
The package is great, the extras, too. This is a must have item.",1058400000,5,5124,4.613362541073385
1753961,3,B00006G8J8,The first five season were much better.  While there are some good episodes they are few and far between.  But if you are a true X-files fan like I am then you will buy all the sets regardless.,1053216000,,193,4.052631578947368
1753962,4,B00006G8J8,"When I first watched the X-Files' Sixth Season episodes on their original air dates, I had developed a love hate relationship with the show.  A fellow fan and friend of mine used to call me up at the very end of each episode to commiserate and watch the coming attractions together.  We'd usually say, ""Well, that one really blew!"" and ""Why don't they just hang it all up.""  We joked that every episode should start with the Fonz from Happy Days jumping a shark tank.
But now, a few years later, watching all the episodes in Season 6 within a few days like one long strange 22 hour movie, I'm starting to like this collection of short spooky tales and tight little supernatural crime dramas.  I guess I'm just accepting them for what they are and looking at the quality of the photography, the acting, the gruesomeness of some of the crimes and the clevereness of some of the episodes.
The show's production unit had moved from Canada to Los Angeles shortly after filming the X-Files feature film ""Fight the Future"" and rumor has it that it was to accomodate David Duchovny who wanted to be close to home and his family.  You can tell that the show had moved to LA.  There is a different lighting at work.  Harsh back lights, burning sun light, more realistic desert landscapes with the sloping shadows of sundown(look at the barren terrain in ""Drive"" and compare that to the handpainted rocky cliffs of ""Anzani"" where Chris Carter literally painted the rocks red to make it look like New Mexico).  The show never looked the same again.  The cinematography changed forever.  As well as the directing.  For some reason, the X-Files last few seasons mastered the art of intense close-up and people's silhouettes in half-shadow with streaming sunlight and lots of reflection off wood panelling.  I don't quite know how I feel about this new cinematographic technique, but I also noticed it's used on a variety of LA based tv shows.
For the record, the show picks up where the feature film leaves off and makes a clean transition from one to the other.  It gives some reasonable explanation why Scully is still a skeptic after being kidnapped to a mothership and infected with an alien virus (she doesn't remember!), but it doesn't explain why Scully is still a skeptic after witnessing men who could walk through solid walls (""Trevor""), an antideluvian sea monster (""Aqua Mala""), her own death (""The Ghosts Who Stole Christmas""), a man who can change the weather (""The Rain King""), scientific proff of an alien/human hybrid (""Two Fathers"", ""One Son"") and eventually, in one of the chilling moments of the season she even uncovers a real flying saucer.  I mean, after experiencing of all this, not to mention the various aliens, monsters and mutants that she's seen with her own eyes in previous seasons, it's a miracle that Dana Scully hasn't gone insane and unbelievable that she still remains a science-based skeptic.  One would think that by this time, she'd be building a Big Foot altar and calling Mulder a skeptic by comparison.
The season makes some attempt to blow the lid off the main story arch, the conspiracy involving the Cigarette Smoking Man and his bosses in New York.  The two episodes that expose the conspiracy do indeed wrap up a lot of plot threads (largely by doing a massacre of a lot of main characters all at once -- don't want to spoil too much here), and we do learn the Smoking Man's real identity, not to mention his wife and son.  But in typical X-files fashion, Smokey's ""real"" name, as Scully points out, is still an alias.  It just happend to be the alias that he used on his marriage license.
The best episodes here are the monster of the week ones.  And although it includes some of the deadest episodes seen to date (including ""The Rain King"" and ""Terms of Endearment"" (which completely wastes the talents of Evil Dead's Bruce Campbell)), we do have a few episodes that rip off famous movies but succeed despite their lack of orginality.  These include ""Drive"" which adds a very strange twist to the movie Speed, and ""Triangle"" which employs Hitchockian techniques to tell a story of time travel in the Devil's Triangle.  These and ""Monday"" which rips off the German masterpiece ""Run Lola Run"" but, like ""Drive"", gains a unique identity apart from it's source, are worth the price of admission, so to speak.  There is also ""Field Trip"", a post-modern mind-bender that stands alone as the best episode of the season.  The finale, ""Biogenesis"", is an attempt to create a new story arch and turn Scully into the Tomb Raider's Chick (check her out in her khaki shorts, busty white tank top and weilding her jungle machete!).
The seventh season, from what I remember, really really blew.  And was the ultimate shark jumping of the entire run of the show.  But this season did indeed have more hidden gems in it that I remembered.",1052092800,7,4857,4.712765957446808
1753963,4,B00006G8J8,"Perhaps the best of the nine, ""The X-Files"" sixth season may also be the most pivotal. Peppering revelations aplenty, the series picks up where the season five finale ""The End"" and 1998 feature film left off. In the season opener, ""The Beginning"", special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) must save a young psychic boy - who may hold the key to all the X-Files - from the clutches of the insidious shadow government. Struggling to be reassigned to the now-closed X-Files, Mulder and Scully must also solve the mystery of a deadly creature lurking in the Arizona desert, all the while fighting through the flak of the FBI's new assistant director, A.D. Kersh (James Pickens Jr.).
All the elements X-Files enthusiasts have come to love return with even more vigor this time around.  The anchor of the entire series, the inimitable chemistry between Mulder and Scully, is taken to amusing new heights in ths sixth season.  The hard-nosed but likeable Walter Skinner (Mitch Pillegi) is back and bucking the Bureau, and Mulder's ever-enigmatic arch-nemesis, Cancer Man (William B. Davis), blows more smoke than ever. You can also expect the usual barrage of complex, poly-syllable sentences spewed by our protagonists, a flotilla of in-jokes, and plenty of sci-fi derivative - in this case, derivative is not a bad word.
By the sixth season, ""The X-Files"" had been firmly established as a television phenomenon, granting creator Chris Carter free reign to tinker with the series. Carter exploited this ability to the hilt, as evidenced by several lighthearted episodes, like the highly experimental ode to Hitchock's ""Rope"", ""Triangle"", the wonderfully twisted yuletide tale ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"", and the hilarious ""Dreamland"", a situation comedy in which Mulder swaps bodies with an Area 51 employee! The satirical statement on conformist suburban life, ""Arcadia"", is another standout - replete with signature Mulder and Scully moments, ""Arcadia"" finds our two favorite FBI agents posing as man and wife to investigate strange disappearances in a planned community. Although season six of ""The X-Files"" lets its hair down long enough to have fun, the focus shifts back to the primary alien/government conspiracy plot in ""Biogenesis"", completing the season with a resounding bang.
With all the gripping plot-twists and alien abduction action, there are still a few bad apples in the season (as with any television series). However, the sixth year of ""The X-Files"" serves as a stable bridge to the memorable final three seasons and compelling finale.
Remember, ""The Truth is out there.""",1045526400,,2629,5.24228028503563
1753964,5,B00006G8J8,"Producer Chris Carter, for various reasons, chief among them being Fox's probable insistence, has moved the entire production to California from Vancouver.  This is notable as some of the scenery for the show changes to scenes in various western states and more prominently in the availability of bigger named guest stars.  On the whole though, at least for this first season out west, these changes serve as an enhancement to the outstanding experience that is ""The X-Files.""  Season six is another excellent season that fluidly picks up where the movie, ""Fight the Future"" left off.
The mythology episodes:
""The Beginning"" An FBI committee decides that yes, the X-Files will be reopened, they will not however, include Agents Mulder and Scully.  Agents Spinder and Fowler will take that role, both with a huge helping of duplicity.  AD Skinner is still on their side though and leads them towards a case that involves the Alien/Syndicate conspiracy.  Gibson Praise makes a return as well.  ""SR 819"" Krycek makes a new appearance and he targets AD Skinner with alien created nanite technology.
""Two Fathers"" & ""One Son"" Long awaited truths are finally revealed about the fifty year conspiracy between the syndicate and the aliens.  The syndicate is all but destroyed by the alien rebels.  Simply stated, these are the two episodes that every fan had been waiting five years for.  No disappointment whatsoever.
""The Unnatural"" I list this as a mythology episode, as it simply does not fit as a stand alone.  This episode is singularly the best episode of the season as it contains some great humor and one of the most touching endings of the season.  We are treated to meeting Arthur Dale or actually his brother, as he tells Mulder the tale of when he met his first alien.
""Biogenesis"" As we learned in ""One Son,"" the Syndicate is gone and with it the Alien/Syndicate conspiracy.  Now we're treated to a new track on the mythology, as there still seems to be some sort of conspiracy evidenced by the discovery of an alien ship in Africa and Fox ending up in a loony bin.  The conclusion will be on the Season Seven set.
Stand alone episodes:
""Drive"" Our heroes run into a man who must continue moving west at a high rate of speed or his head will explode.  ""Triangle"" a true X-Files classic as Mulder goes on a search for a ship that's been missing from the Bermuda Triangle since prior to WWII.
""Dreamland & Dreamland II"" Mulder and Scully take a trip to Area 51, where they run into the ""Men in Black"" and they witness a UFO which literally makes Mulder switch bodies with one of the MIB's.  These are simply two of the finest and most hilarious X-Files episodes of the entire nine year run.  ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"" a beautifully well written episode guest starring Ed Asner and Lily Tomlin.
""Terms of Endearment"" another extremely well written episode as our heroes visit Roanoke, VA and run across a bedraggled demon who is in search of a normal child.  This episode has another one of those wonderfully well written ironic endings that only Chris Carter is capable of.  ""The Rain King"" Mulder and Scully take a trip to Kansas to investigate a man who can supposedly make rain at will.  This episode is replete with some of the series most hilarious lines.
""Agua Mala"" Mulder and Scully take a trip to Florida in the middle of a hurricane to investigate a family's disappearance and discover a sea creature.  ""Monday"" this is an X-Files homage to ""Ground Hog Day,"" that is superbly written and played.  ""Arcadia"" in this beautiful episode our erstwhile heroes pose undercover as husband and wife to discover why three couples have disappeared from a planned community.
""Alpha"" Mulder and Scully are summoned by an internet friend of his to find a mysterious wild animal that has been shipped to the US that has killed two merchant marines and then disappears.  ""Trevor"" is an intriguing episode in which Mulder and Scully set off to find a prison escapee who supposedly died in a tornado, yet he's on the loose and exhibiting some interesting abilities.
""Milagro"" this is an interesting yet horrifying episode in which a writer, fascinated with Scully moves in next to Mulder and begins spying on her.  Meanwhile Mulder and Scully are investigating several deaths where victims' hearts have been removed, but there is no evidence as to how.  ""Three of a Kind"" the quintessential ""Lone Gunmen"" episode that just shines with a pure brilliance that may well have been the precursor to their short lived spin off series.  ""Field Trip"" our two heroes end up in North Carolina and run into a hallucinogenic fungal mountain.  This episode definitely breeches the different barrier, even for this series!
Special features - Included, as with the other season's boxed sets, are some great special features to include my personal favorite - ""Character profile on the Cigarette Smoking Man.""  The cover art for the boxed set and DVD's is fantastic as well.  {ssintrepid}

1753965,4,B00006G8J8,"I am not going to elaborate on the technical details of the DVD collection of Season Six, since more nit-picky people have already gone in depth into that area.  My review is going to focus solely on the episode quality in terms of characters and plot.  This season really marked a turning point in the X-Files series.  Notably, the filming had been moved from Vancouver to California, which removed some of the dark grittiness that fans had come to expect and love.
Following the success of the movie and presumably an influx of new fans that had not followed the previous five seasons, the writers/producers opted to wrap up the conspiracy mythology (episodes ""Two Fathers"" and ""One Son"") and replace it with a more ambiguous plot (""Biogenesis"").  We bid farewell to the members of the Syndicate and the ""human controlled"" government subterfuge.  This sudden change of track upset many hardcore followers of the series.
As far as the recurring characters go, we see surprisingly little of the fan-favorite Cigarette Smoking Man.  The character of Mulder's informant Marita Covarrubias continues to atrophy with only one appearance this season.  We also see little development of the newly introduced FBI Agents Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who succeed Mulder and Scully at the X-Files.  Alex Krycek makes a few appearances, but little is done with his character.  The only shining point is the introduction of the character of Assistant Director Kersh, who will continue to be a thorn in the sides of Mulder, Scully, and Assistant Director Skinner until the last episodes of Season Nine.
In this season, the groundwork is being layed for the eventual departure of Fox Mulder (most notably ""Biogenesis""), that will continue to build throughout Season Seven until it culminates in Season Eight.  Scully's character is paid tribute in many episodes including ""Milagro"" and ""Tithonus"".
The weakest aspect of this season is the downturn in writing quality.  The gritty tension and suspense of former seasons seem to be almost gone in the episodes of this season.  We see the writers turning away from scary and often thought-provoking plots to the most inelaborate forms of humor.  Stemming from this comes the WORST X-FILES EPISODE EVER: ""The Rain King"".  This is the perhaps the first time that I could not wait for commercials simply because they were more entertaining than the episode itself.  The writing quality also changed in presenting stories with a modicum of credibility.  That was what made the X-Files great...just enough reality to make an otherwise preposterous story believable.  And scary things that are somewhat believable are almost always ten times more frightening.  That philosophy departs the series towards the beginning of the season with ""Dreamland I"" and ""Dreamland II"" that, although amusing, are nothing more than a rehash of a plot twist that has been used time and time again in science fiction.
Despite its shortcomings, this is still the X-Files and I love it for its good and its bad.  Well, maybe I don't love ""The Rain King"" episode.  The episode ""The Beginning"" does well transitioning from the X-Files movie and the Season Five finale.  ""S.R. 819"" builds an interesting Skinner subplot with technology that few realize exists.  ""Two Fathers"" and ""One Son"" do a tidy wrap up of the former mythology episodes with a satisfying conclusion.  Fans of the Lone Gunmen will adore ""Three of a Kind"".  And ""Biogenesis"" does an adequate job initiating the new mythology episodes and sparking the beginning of Mulder's departure.
As a fan, I believe that all the DVD box sets are a ""must own"", but bare in mind that this season definitely marks the ""passing of the threshold"".",1042675200,10,3707,5.0492610837438425

The DVD quality is solid, and the extras don't disappoint. If you're fan, of course you're going to buy this set. If you're a casual viewer, you won't be disappointed. This might be the last season worth watching as a whole.

1753999,5,B00006G8J8,"Well, I may not be considered a true X-Files fan because I am only now getting into the series.  I have not had the good fortune of watching the series in order.  I started watching it in reruns mid-season 5 on FX. I followed it through to the end of season 8, and their replay of season 1.  I am now playing catch up, having seen all of season 3 and half of 9.  In one way it's been brutal, but at the same time I am so thankful for having X-Files now, since there is nothing worthwhile on TV currently.  With that said, season 6 has been my favorite season of what I have seen.  I have more episodes on tape from that season than any other.  I am a HUGE fan of Vince Gilligan, who has written most of my favorite episodes.  I am a fan of the more humorous episodes, ""Bad Blood"", ""Jose Chung's From Outer Space"", and ""Small Potatoes"" being my all time favorite episodes.  I really enjoyed the stand-alone episodes in season 6.  ""How The Ghosts Stole Christmas"" was my favorite of the year, but ""Triangle"", ""Monday"" (The late Carrie Hamilton was awesome!!), ""Milagro"", ""Field Trip"", and ""Tithonous"" were also favorites of mine.  The other highlight of season 6 for me was ""Dreamland I & II"".  I thoroughly enjoyed those episodes.  The mythology episodes have been harder for me, since I am watching out of sequence.  I believe now that I need to watch ""One Son"" and ""Two Fathers"" again.  I remember not being too impressed with those episodes, but at that point I had not seen enough of the mythology episodes.  In fact, it was the mythology episodes that kept me from jumping into X-Files sooner.  I was worried that I would be lost.  Speaking of lost, although I enjoyed ""Biogenesis"" and the following ""Sixth Extinction I & II"" of season 7, I would love for someone to explain to me what exactly was removed from Mulder, and put into CSM.  That has been the one thing that I have not been able to process.  I have watched it many times, but my little brain has yet to figure that one out.  Still, I am so thankful for the series now.  I would have nothing to watch.  I must also say that it has raised my expectations for the upcoming Taken.  I do believe that X-Files has raised the bar for all science fiction and television for that matter.  It makes it hard to digest the ill-conceived poorly produced crap that television throws our way these days.  Back to the point, I have seen many box sets of TV shows hitting the market lately, and X-Files is the only one I have been tempted to spend the money on.  It is actually one of the few shows not only worth your time, but your money as well.",1036281600,4,2598,4.325051759834369
1754000,5,B00006G8J8,"Season 6 features a definite change in character for The X-Files. It features probably the best collection of standalone episodes in any season to date, including Triangle and How The Ghosts Stole Christmas - two of the best eps the show ever produced - along with Dreamland, Arcadia, Three of a Kind, and The Unnatural. No other season has more of my favorite episodes, or such a great collection of one-offs. On the other hand, it does also have what I consider the second-worst episode ever, Agua Mala (second only to the dreadful Home), and the whole conspiricy arc becomes somewhat incoherent post-X-Files-movie. The two new occasionally recurring characters, Spender and Fowley, never quite gel or reach us the way Dogget and Reyes eventually would. Fortunately they don't get that much screen time. It seems that the show just hit the point where we knew enough about the Syndicate that they no longer were dramatically effective - which was clearly inevitible - and  nothing stepped in to fill the hole they left behind.
After this season, the best episodes are always the stand-alone ones, non-arc episodes, while the continuing backstory eps fade into the margins. That's OK; for me, very few of my all-time favorite X-Files episodes are conspiricy-related ones. I love the Post-Modern Prometheus, Bad Blood, Jose Chung, Kill Switch, etc., and if you agree with me, there is a *lot* to like in Season 6, with some amazingly well-written, well-acted, well-directed, great-looking shows that set new standards for television; really the X-Files at its peak, stuff that makes even the best of Star Trek or Babylon 5 look amateurish. But, there is some loss in consistancy with the faltering of the backstory, so I'd judge it doesn't quite have the consistancy of Season 4 or Season 5. Still, overall Seasons 4-6 of The X-Files really are all of tremendously high quality and get the highest recommendation from me.",1036108800,,1921,5.003125
1754001,4,B00006G8J8,"I am a huge fan of the X-Files but I do agree that the move to film the X-Files in California did remove the gloomy, eerie, and downright scary look to the show. Even so, I did enjoy this season, though not nearly as much as I enjoyed the previous seasons (especially Seasons 1 - 3).
The pros: The Unnatural (Baseball player is an alien. M & S have normal conversations.  ""Hips before hands."" Written and directed by Duchovny--much better than Hollywood A.D. from Season 7. Very sweet lesson to learn with baseball.), Milagro (Serial killer (maybe or maybe not) has the hots for S. Insight into Scully. ""Scully's already in love.""), Triangle (This one might be my favorite episode of the season. M steps into a time warp on a cruise ship. Filmed with as few cuts as possible.  Great job by all the actors! Insight into Mulder: What he thinks of Scully and everyone else in his life.  Mulder is at his most exuberant and Scully is antsy.  Kiss between M & S is great but the scene was poorly lit.  Is it reality or Mulder's dream? Hmm....), Monday (""Groundhog Day"" look-alike.  M has a waterbed?  M in wet pajama bottoms!), Dreamland I & II (M & Lenny from Laverne & Shirley switch bodies. M & S interaction. Lenny's M tries to seduce S.  Episode does have some dumb moments with M & Lenny dancing in the mirror.), and How the Ghosts Stole Christmas (M tricks S into investigating a haunted house. Insight into M & S. Many funny lines--""...left cheek sneak."").
Chris Carter messed up another mythology factor, though: getting rid of the Syndicate in this season (Two Fathers/One Son). (I won't even get into how he messed up the Samantha mytharc in Season 7--the starlight people?!) I am kinda biased against the mytharc episodes. I like the stand alones better.
The cons: Field Trip (confusing episode with M & S sharing the same hallucination...right! I really do not know why this episode is so popular with fans.), The Rain King (Guy can control the weather--stupid.  Episode has one of the old Saturday Night Live Players in it.), and Three of a Kind (The Lone Gunmen episode. I do love those guys but they cannot carry an episode. But...you do get to see S act like a bimbo.).
Overall, good quality season--on par with Seasons 4 - 5. Season 7 is the problem child of the series. Season 6 is still great.  However, check with Fox about Season 6.  There is a rumor out there that a replacement disk will be sent to people who purchased this season because of the poor quality of Triangle.  I will still call Fox but Triangle looks great to me.",1034380800,3,2546,4.522875816993464
1754002,4,B00006G8J8,"This season 1013 Productions moved it's production team down to LA, and they let you know this with the first shot of the first episode of the season, where a glaring sun sits in a blue sky of heat, resting on a desert plateau.
This was the start of something slightly different for The X-Files, some think for the better, some not. There was more of a comedic element involved in many episodes, but the show didn't lose it's dramatic edge either, while still keeping the Mulder-Scully banter very much alive. There were winners and losers in season six, and middle ground to be fought over too. In hindsight, the mytharc episodes of this season accomplished the incredibly feat of not only answering almost all of the questions fans (and Mulder) have been searching for, but also started a new strand of mythology that would not be finally concluded until the show's denouement  - and all in six episodes. Other winners include ""Monday"", ""Tithonus"", ""Rain King"", ""Drive"" and of course the beautifully-constructed ""Triangle"", which earned Chris Carter some due Emmy attention. Middle ground includes such episodes as ""Arcadia"", which while a less-than-superb episode with reference to the actual story, did display amusing insights into the continuing affection between Mulder and Scully. There were losers too, of course, but when compared to some of the other ""televisual feasts"" that have shared history by being on-air the same time as X-Files, the production values of this show alone make the series the acme, not only of the science-fiction genre for the past decade, but also the epitome of that once-dead package: The one-hour drama. It was The X-Files that revived the one-hour drama and the fledling network Fox, and it is this show that endured for nine years because of the incredible amount of hard work that went into it. Season Six may not be the best season of the show, but it is certainly one of the best seasons of television. This season The X-Files was nominated for over half a dozen Emmy awards, and won two Golden Globes.",1032393600,13,2046,4.879310344827586
1754003,4,B00006G8J8,"Although season 6 of the X-files provided many laughs and entertaining episodes, it is not the series finest. The move from Vancouver to L.A. gave the X-files a sort of phony look. When the show was in Vancouver it always had a sort of creepy look to it, but in L.A. it just looked like all other shows. But it still remains to me the best shows ever created. And season 6th is definetly an excellent addition to any collection.",1029801600,8,428,4.3625
1754004,3,B00006G8J8,"I've come across many fans of The X-Files that proclaim Season Six to be the best season of the show; however, I think it continued the decline which started in Season Five and ended with the introduction of Robert Patrick as Agent Doggett.
I really enjoyed the mythology this season - The Beginning, Two Fathers, One Son and Biogenesis concluded elements of the myth arc, whilst adding new elements (which were only really taken further in Season Nine). I did find it frustrating that there were only four traditional myth episodes this season - like Season Seven, I felt that it needed more focus on the mythology to keep the story progressing. After ""One Son"", the conspiracy arc seems to go into remission until Seasons Eight and Nine.
The standalone episodes are in my opinion, a mixed bunch. There are some really great stories - my favourites being ""Drive"", ""Triangle"", ""Dreamland I/II"", ""Monday"",
""Milagro"", ""How The Ghosts Stole Christmas"" and ""The Unnatural"". But there are also plenty of stinkers - ""The Rain King"", ""Arcadia"", ""Trevor"", ""Agua Mala"", ""Aplha""......
Like Season Five, its a mixed bunch. Over the course of Seasons Five, Six, and Seven, you get some really great episodes - but unlike the first four and last two seasons, there are more rubbish episodes in each season.",1029542400,13,1293,4.935779816513762
