Few suggestions

1. In the screen they should have made the Speakers face little and should have given more room for the e.gs they are showing in writing. Currently the letters are so small to read and the speaker is occupying 85% of the screen space

2. The speaker is talking too fast

3. The various important points should be reiterated
