1394271,5,B000055XNQ,This concert video is a must see for any Eurythmics or Annie Lennox fan.  I bought mine in Europe and the quality of transfer is just superb-audio and video.,988156800,2,157,4.413793103448276
1394272,2,B000055XNQ,"Wish I could be more enthusiastic. Video a ""3"", audio a ""2"".
5.1 mix with voice not coming from center speaker (as it should) but from overhead. Extra materials just okay.",982108800,,171,4.548387096774194
1394273,4,B000055XNQ,"Annie Lennox is one of modern music's most gifted vocalists and songwriters.  Captured on this DVD live from Central Park, Annie shows the remarkable range of her career - from the cutting edge sounds of Eurythmics to the sophisticated leanings of her recent solo albums.  It's all here in one gorgeous package!
As a bonus, four promotional videos from the ""Medusa"" album are included as well as interview snippets.  Watch Annie's transformation in the interviews from feelings of insecurity about performing live after so long, to exhilaration and amazement after the actual event.  A chronicle of her psyche, so to speak.  What a prelude to the Eurythmics tour that came just a few short years later!",976752000,7,702,5.017241379310345
1394274,5,B000055XNQ,Breath taking... It's my favorite live performance of anie lennox.... a must have !!,976752000,2,84,5.071428571428571
1394275,4,B000055XNQ,"Awesome video - I felt like I was at the concert. It would be great if they issued this in DVD. I've already worn out one copy. I never listened to her  before seeing this vid. now I'm a big fan.
Buy it you won't be  disappointed!",949536000,2,230,3.872340425531915
1394276,3,B000055XNQ,"It is probably a matter of taste. As the concert starts off with slow paced songs that all sound like variations on the same song. Yet I am used to a handful of the popular songs. So while I was waiting for something recognizable I noticed the audience was enthralled. If they were so may you be.

About 40 minutes into the concert Annie finally picks up speed. At 57 minutes into it the concert is over and a documentary begins. A few of the Annie songs I am used to are sprinkled in the documentary. I guess I like planned choreography more than live.

The DVD extras are worth it. The first is just a list of the songs in order so you can go to your favorite. The one marked ""jukebox allows you to build a personal play list or shuffle all. The setup allows you to display the lyrics.",1351728000,,787,4.171052631578948
1394277,5,B000055XNQ,I JUST LOVE ANNIE LENNOX AND HAVE FOR YEARS I HAVE SEVERAL OF HER CDS BUT TO WATCH HER PERFORM LIVE IS PURE PLEASURE!!! WHAT A TALENT!! SHE HAS HER ON STYLE AND DOES NOT COMPROMISE AND THATS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HER.,1261180800,,213,3.9767441860465116
1394278,3,B000055XNQ,"I am a great fan of Annie Lennox, so this was the only way I could enjoy her live on video. Her performance was excellent and the song list satisfies. The picture quality was pretty mediocre even though it was letterboxed. The sound quality fared better...above average.",1244505600,,270,4.76595744680851
1394279,5,B000055XNQ,"No one can accuse Annie Lennox of not feeling the music she is singing. There is a raw intensity when she sings and this attribute really comes shining through in this enthralling live performance. She proves that you don't need billion dollar sets and video trickery to put on a great show. What you need is talent and sincerity.

Annie's voice is in top form and the set a good cross section of her career (including her Eurythmics days). I have seen several performances she has done of You Have Placed A Chill In My Heart but this I feel is her best (I'm sure someone will right to challenge that statement).

I didn't mind the snippets of rehearsal footage and it didn't feel like it was interfering with ""the show"".

The addition of the promotional videos at the end is really just the cherry on the cake.",1202256000,,811,4.466216216216216
1394280,4,B000055XNQ,"Obviously a must for Lennox fans. Most of the songs are from her ""Diva"" CD and very well performed. She warms up after the first few tunes and as her interview states she reacts to her audience's enthusiasm. She's a wonderful lyricist and composer. Video quality is acceptable but audio is above average. It's obvious they spent time rehearsing as the renditions are almost indistiguishable from the original recordings.

I could have done without the ears on the musicians but like Rush's tumbling washers/dryers during their ""Vapor Trails"" tour I guess it's all part of the act.",1181606400,,580,4.979381443298969
1394281,5,B000055XNQ,"is well presented in this DVD.  She is just so talented as a performer, writer and arranger.  We saw this show when it was presented on TV in 1995.  Having it on DVD is icing on the cake.",1178582400,,187,3.8684210526315788
1394282,5,B000055XNQ,"I love both Annie Lennox and Eurythmics, especially their live performances, and this Live In Central Park is simply stunning: Annie knows how to make her interpretations unforgettable. Wonderful as usual, wrapped in a daring tartan suit, she leaps on the stage catching the audience with her exclusive voice. The concert includes songs from her solo albums Diva and Medusa and also hits from her Eurythmic career. You can also view the song's lyrics as subtitles. The concert is mixed together with footages of Annie in N.Y. and studio rehearsals with the band. The DVD also contains the videoclips for No More ""I Love You's"", A Whiter Shade Of Pale, Waiting in Vain (very funny, with a multi-Annie playing Minnie Mouse) and Something So Right. Each video is presented by Annie sitting in the theatre where some clips were filmed. Maybe the DVD could appear a bit dated, but remember that it was filmed for the first time in 1995.

Here is the concert playlist:

1. Money Can't Buy It (Diva, 1992): similar to the album version. ***

2. Legend In My Living Room (Diva, 1992): similar to the album version. ***

3. Walking On Broken Glass (Diva, 1992): a very happy and inspired rendition. *****

4. No More ""I Love You's"" (Medusa, 1995): touching and intimate: Annie performs with the same hairstyle of the videoclip. *****

5. Who's That Girl? (Touch, 1983): sensuality and angst for one of the best performance of the concert. *****

6. You Have Placed A Chill In My Heart (Savage, 1987): to the verse ""I just want someone to hold"", Annie thrills the audience screaming ""I"" for nine times! Disarming. ****

7. Waiting In Vain (Medusa, 1995): a Bob Marley classic reinterpreted with guitar accompaniment. ****

8. I Love You Like A Ball And Chain (Be Yourself Tonight, 1985): a roaring performance launched by a powerful only-voice intro. ****

9. Little Bird (Medusa, 1995): smart and electronic. ****

10. Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) (from the same title album, 1983): Eurythmics' masterpiece, always magic and upsetting. *****

11. Train In Vain (Medusa, 1995): simply intriguing and exciting. Amazing. *****

12. Why (Medusa, 1995): Annie's solo masterpiece, elegant and moving. *****

Videoclips (all the videos are from Medusa, 1995)

1. No More ""I Love You's"": Male dancers dressed as ballet girls (!) introduce you to Annie, eerie mistress in front of a creepy audience. *****

2. A Whiter Shade Of Pale: Ms. Lennox, dressed as a teddy bear with a pageboy cut, goes on a swing in a circus arena, surrounded by clowns, dancers and a white horse. ****

3. Waiting In Vain: Annie ""Minnie Mouse"" does the cleaning up, waiting for her love as the seasons pass. At the end of the video there will be six Annies!!! *****

4. Something So Right: dressing a costume, Annie plays in a theatre, filmed like in an old recital. The less impressive video of the series. ***

And now... Enjoy it!",1157846400,4,2895,4.800403225806452
1394283,4,B000055XNQ,"I am an Annie Lennox fan. I enjoy her powerful alto voice and respect her vocal range. I would listen to her sing anything. Because of that, this is a very enjoyable DVD for me. If I try to be objective, it may lack in video presentation and have some audio issues. It was recorded outside and the lighting and stage setting may not impress a lot of people. I also think it takes a while for her to hit the kind of intensity that would impress the less dedicated fan. If you are a hardcore fan, it's all good, but if you want a spectacular stage show and pristine audio and video, you may want to pass on this one.",1144627200,2,614,4.082644628099174
1394284,5,B000055XNQ,"The title is how I feel about this remarkable DVD. It's a one of a kind concert, which only Annie can give you. Totally of her own, personal line of taste and performance. I not only have this DVD, but own the VHS edition too! The VHS has less stuff on it, and the sound is a bit off. That's why I had to have the DVD. All through the show, Annie loses herself in her songs, and takes on a different personality. She wowed the crowd throughout all her greatest songs and some new stuff too, never seen before, live.
I personally love ""Why"", ""Waiting in Vain"", ""Little Bird"", ""Legend in my living room"", ""I love you like a ball and chain"" and ""Train in vain"". These songs are all great performed live.
""Money can't buy it"" is almost like the original CD version, but I don't think Annie would ever think of lip synching to a song. This particular song has that groovy, laid-back feeling to it.
Kind of sexy, tough, crazy, and vulnerable all in one.
""Why"" brings back the memories of when the Diva CD was released. I was so happy to hear such a soulful, sadly beautiful song on such a beautiful album. Same with the live version. I think this is the only version live that brings me to tears.
""You have placed a chill in my heart"" shows that Annie has it all, when she sings. She loses herself in the animal called talent. This is the only song Annie has sung live, where she can really go to town vocally. What amazing adlib and moves only she can do, I appreciate this golden oldie for all it's worth.
""No more I love you's"" is one of those songs where vocals and adlib are lacking. This live version is not as good as the Medusa CD version. Not too much else I can say about this one.
""Walking on broken glass"" is not one of my favourites, but is a good song about sentimental love, and Annie & band kind of sped it up for the concert. It's slightly faster than the cd version. The sound is good though, and shows the teamwork of Annie's bandmates.
""Waiting in vain"" is a remarkable solo performance only accompanied by Paul Pesco on guitar. What a lovely performance! I didn't like this song before, like I do now. One of those live songs where you can picture the lighters flickering in the audience, with all the lights out.
""Legend in my living room"". I have three words for this one.
It Rocks Bigtime! Annie obviously sold her audience, just by writing this song. What an energetic performance.
""Who's that girl?"" and ""Here comes the rain again"" are two of my least favourite Eurythmics songs, but when Annie takes hold of them solo, they get my attention.
The promotional video clips are good. Annie introduces them well described. The behind the scenes/cd & memorabilia signing scenes are fun. We get to see Annie in a relaxed wardrobe of genuinely glamourous, but conservative clothing. I like the description of each video, as they play. Glad she included the clip of ""No more I love you's"" here. And, it's nice to see the actual place where they shot for the making of the video.
One thing not found on the VHS edtion:
The video clip of ""Something so right"". What a great song. I believe it's a Paul Simon cover tune, and Annie Lennox has brought it out of its slumber. Her costume in the clip leaves a lot to be desired, but her long-haird wig is a nice touch.
The video clip to ""Waiting in vain"" is funny, where Annie is portraying herself as Minnie Mouse the House-Maid. What an unuaual way to appear in a video! At the end of the clip, there appears to be about 6 of Annie, all dressed in different colors of her tacky, but whimsical maid outfit.

Well, it was fun reviewing the DVD of Annie Lennox Live In Central Park. I hope this review helped you.
Go buy it and see for yourself, just how much Annie Lennox rules and owns the stage, no matter where she is.",1034294400,37,4314,4.308641975308642
1394285,3,B000055XNQ,"I was thrilled to get this DVD and I was pretty much satisfied with quality of this DVD edition.

7931177,2,B000055XNQ,"Seeing this I realize that I don't especially like her early songs, although her presentation makes them more interesting than just hearing them on a CD..  Other problem was that the quality of sound was marginal, especially the interviews at the end which were poorly recorded, almost unintelligible.  I also found some of the music videos at the end pretty gross!",1501632000,,365,4.967213114754099

7931181,5,B000055XNQ,"She is so original with a big voice.  I really think she would be at her best if she did more covers.
And her latest Nostalgia is just that.
But I loved her MTV Eurythmic videos more than her live performances.
This looks almost like a VHS transfer at times.  The sound is ok on the songs.  But that's 1995 video quaity.
What a vamp she is.
Waiting in Vain by Bob Marley is a very sparsely done version in Central Park with only two guitars but she really puts herself into the lyrics.  For me it was the most transcendant moment of the concert.
If you dig into the interviews you will find a elaborately produced version MTV style of Waiting in Vains.
Another cover that is great is A Whiter Shade of Pale, which was extremely hard to find on the menu but I finally found it.
She has a David Bowie electronica thing going on in some songs too, which is great.
The weird thing about this DVD is that the list of songs doesn't agree with the list inside and outside of the box.
Also some of the songs toggle between a studio version and the stage version.  So she is in different outfits, She wears
a Scottish plaid on stage in Central Park.
She is so creative, way beyond what you can find on todays contemporary pop scene.
For example her video of No More I Love Yous is choreographed from a scene painted by Toulouse Latrec.  She explains the symbolism and the meaning of the song in one of the interviews.
She discusses her early private life too in an introspective way and with a candor not associated with pop singers today.
In fact she is a real artist, not a commercial commodity. This is unknown today in the commercialized pop music scene today.",1459036800,,1655,4.32258064516129

7931184,5,B000055XNQ,"Annie Lennox is the best, and it certainly shows in this DVD. Her band is tight, and she clearly likes to perform. The interviews provide a lot of insight, and the bonus videos are nice. The huge audience at Central Park really got into the show, with lots of folks singing along. A great DVD, and highly recommended. I purchased my copy used on Amazon Marketplace (It's out of print) for a very reasonable price, and the disc was in like-new condition.",1389484800,,453,4.536585365853658
