The goal is to get the child interacting, not to dictate what constitutes fun.  That's a fundamental violation of their relationship warmth!

gee, that's only the first five minutes of film.  I am rewatching it now.  I am sure I have a billion criticisms of this DVD because I used a better method in the long run that helped my kid with language delays..called CP, Communicating Partners, from Dr. James MacDonald (Dr. Jim)

please see my review for the Floortime DVD training Series #1 for more info, and two free recommendations that WILL help your child with language delays or autism!

8069946,5,B0009XZITQ,Am using the knowledge and the experience of this DVD to bring excitement to others about another way of working with children  who may be more of a challenge. My enthusiasm was contagious and others are interested in pursing this program and challenging oneself.,1373068800,,263,4.9772727272727275
8069947,5,B0009XZITQ,"Another reviewer seems to be looking for a quick fix which DIR/Floortime is anything but. DIR/Floortime is subtle yet very effective for many higher functioning ASD children. It takes quite a while to learn DIR/Floortime through observing professionals doing it. These DVDs help broaden training, but they are by no means a replacement for direct observation. I don't think they even intended these for a replacement. These comments come from my personal experience observing several hundred hours of Floortime and ABA instruction given to my child by instructors with an average of 20 years of experience.  If used properly, these DVDs are rather good.  The production quality is NOT good, though.  No Academy's here.",1196035200,2,718,5.280701754385965
8069948,1,B0009XZITQ,"This 'training' series did not fit my learning style at all.  Actually, Im not sure how they can even call it training.  I thought different methods/strategies would be  taught and then examples would be given so I would be knowledgeable enough to apply floortime therapy at home.  Instead, the introduction on each of the DVDs in this series is the same.  Even the books for the series are exactly the same in the beginning and end.  The only difference is the type of children used in the play examples.  Instead of being trained I feel like Im just watching different parents playing with their kids.  Every once in awhile a suggestion is made to the parents on how to interact differently.  I don't want to watch random parents playing with their children to glean from it whatever I may.  I have never received any sort of training in this manner.  It seems like they didn't want to put much effort into this training series so they just videoed a couple of sessions and copied them to DVD.  Every DVD in this series was a huge disappointment and waste of money.",1169424000,3,1067,4.557894736842106
