7837869,5,6303063683,"""No Fear No Die"" is the name of a rooster bred for cockfighting in Europe. This film is about a great friendship between No Fear No Die's two trainers, & about perfection in preparing for the fight. Although staging animals to fight to the death seems unfair, it becomes clear that contests between humans are less fair. After a tragic confrontation ending in the death of a human, we are left with a bright sky, clouds floating away and a sense of something(however unknowable)true & permanent. Note they told the woman not to touch No Fear No Die.",1119830400,2,549,4.612244897959184
