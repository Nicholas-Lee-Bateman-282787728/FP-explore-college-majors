8029943,5,B0002OOV72,"""Palms and Passion is absolutely beautiful!  The artistry of this film is amazing as is the story.  I was so enthralled, having first seen the film on Netflix, that I purchased the last three copies that were then available on Amazon.  I have given them to my Christian friends as gifts.  This one is a DVD that you will want to keep in your library forever!",1408838400,,358,4.378787878787879
8029944,2,B0002OOV72,"We ordered it because it had Damaris Carbaugh's name on it.  We thought it would have some of her music.  It does not.

If you want some relaxing music filled with video of the Holy Land, without Damaris, then you will enjoy it.",1378598400,,228,4.255813953488372
8029945,5,B0002OOV72,"This is a wonderful and moving travel documentary that traces the life of Jesus Christ by exploring a variety of locations, including Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Sea of Galilee, Nazareth, Jericho, Jordan River and the Valley of Jezreel (Armageddon). The picturesque landscape is bolstered by a soundscape that features traditional Hebrew music.

A unique pilgrimage of sight and sound makes the extraordinary history come alive in the heart and soul.",1231286400,,444,5.529411764705882
