8434123,4,B004LBA06S,"There was a terrible familiarity with this about three minutes in: haven't I seen this before? Well, I had. It is a repeat from Volume 2, British Rail Journeys, which I already own. Okay, so I am 75 and am permitted to be a bit forgetful, I guess. Anyway, this is a trip from Cambridge to Sheringham in the Southeast of England, shot in the '90s and quite scenic. Very worthwhile although, if you bought Volume 2, you would get two segments of this excellent series for what you are paying for just this one. Either way it is a worthwhile investment.",1306368000,2,550,4.401960784313726
