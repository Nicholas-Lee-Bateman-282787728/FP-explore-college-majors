7131170,5,B00WERYXIW,"Started with a kid missing - a simple family story, the movie went deeper into Chinese modern social network and business/police/legal environment. Like in a tour bus, we got to see every corners (every layers) of Chinese society with many surprises. Everyone's performance was so well - testing every senses: heartfelt sadness, despair, incomplete-joy, and natural love of all kinds. Based a real story, this tragedy tested our feelings - we have no way to describe - not to experience. What do you call the quilty feeling, when you have to desclare the death of your missing son in order to get a permit to give birth of your second child? You tell me!",1514505600,3,654,4.745614035087719
7131171,5,B00WERYXIW,"Ten Stars would NOT be enough.
How does one or how can one Rate a movie that you finish knowing that your life has somehow, in the space of 2 hours been altered forever.
Neither the Film's title nor the Amazon ""summary' even begin to hint at or suggest the overwhelming power of this unique film that cannot be assigned to any existing category of Film.

As a few other Reviewers have stated, this is a film that captures all the contradictions and ironies of Life wherein sometimes, as in a Greek Tragedy, the most well meaning and most innocent people are in the end, doomed to suffer the most Human Heartbreak - through no fault of their own.

We are all aware this has occurred throughout all of history.  But somehow in this film, DEAREST, we see how this irony of life can reach out and affect, in the most terrible ways, the most vulnerable human beings and those least able to defend themselves.

We encounter on Amazon, countless great films, beautifully acted and Directed.  But DEAREST is somehow far more than the sum of its parts.

It is Cinema raised to the level of Great Art.  We finish watching this film, based on real life events, shaken to the roots of our Souls and wondering how or even if, we personally could have ever dealt with the Heart wrenching challenges faced by the characters in this film and still maintained our Sanity.

This film could NOT be further from most of what emanates from the contemporary Hollywood film studios of today.
""DEAREST"" is what all movies should aspire to achieve- but few ever succeed in doing.

If wild car chases and unrelenting explosions are your cup of tea, this is NOT a Movie for you.  DEAREST deals with themes of far more human consequence and Philosophical import than your run of the mill films that glorify violence and death.

As stated on WIKIPEDIA:
""Dearest"" is a 2014 Chinese-language film directed by the Master Director PETER CHAN on kidnapping in China, based on a true story, starring Zhao Wei, Huang Bo, Tong Dawei, Hao Lei, Zhang Yi and Zhang Yuqi. It was screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.""

DEAREST is indeed a ""Special Presentation"".  This film represents Cinematic Film Drama at its ultimate Best.
We leave this Film, shaken, saddened and yet somehow ennobled that we have shared and Witnessed such a powerful work of Cinematic Art.

For such a Rare Achievement I would submit that EVEN TEN STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH.",1513641600,5,2458,4.686046511627907
7131172,5,B00WERYXIW,"Haven't ever posted a review about a movie but was so moved by this unexpectedly intense and emotionally moving story (and surprised by the low number of reviews). The movie addresses a real and serious issue in China, and portrays the way of life accurately. With this story you learn there's no right or wrong - you understand the intentions of the people involved and their struggles. Another surprise at the end was finding out this was a true story - the end of the moving shows the actors learning the stories of the people they will portray on film and their meeting. Great acting from well-respected actors make this a definite tear-jerker with both sad and heartwarming moments.",1511568000,2,687,4.781512605042017

7131175,4,B00WERYXIW,"Powerful film that shows both sides of a very intense issue.  I watched this in a few periods of time as it's over two hours long.  Very well done, but too long for my taste.",1477958400,,174,3.942857142857143
7131176,4,B00WERYXIW,"Seen in a movie theater. A Chinese neo-realism, describing the modern Chinese society as is rather than as should be. A divorced couple, he running a failing internet business, she re-married to a rich businessman, split custody of their 3-year old son. When she brings him for a weekend with his father, the boy runs after her disappearing Audi and is kidnapped by a stranger. Following the first frantic days, it becomes clear that the child will be very hard, if not impossible to locate. The two parents eventually join a kidnapped children support group, through which we discover that child kidnapping and trade are a daily reality in China. After three years, the parents almost miraculously discover their boy (now six) in a distant village. The woman who claims the boy (and his younger ""sister"") is hers, admits eventually that both children were brought to her by her deceased husband. The boy rejoins (reluctantly) his true parents and the girl lands in a state orphanage. But the would-be mother, after serving her 6 months sentence, continues to pine for and pursue her lost children. There are more interesting and dramatic side-lines to the main theme of this long movie.
The writer and the director of the movie (based on a real case), shows the tragedy of the parents, whose child was kidnapped, the kidnapper's wife, who loves the children as a real parent does, and the children, embroiled in a no-win situation. Great directing, acting and shooting, though slightly too long. Definitely worth seeing. A caution - you might need a stiff drink after the movie. It's not an easy movie to sit through.",1439683200,3,1618,4.887272727272728

8712965,5,B00WERYXIW,u can always count on a Huang Bo movie to surpass your expectations.  Huang Bo at his best! Great acting by all! Love the way each family and each characters were portrayed.  there wasn't a character you could hate or blame.,1530662400,,224,4.439024390243903
8712966,5,B00WERYXIW,"This movie made me reflect a lot about kinship. What accompanies when we gave birth to our children seems to be the natural ownership to them. Yet is it necessary to focus so much on ""MY child"" and ""MY baby"" when universal love does exist. To know that someone else cares for your baby as much as you do, should you be worried or happy? I think we all should be happy. Now they have double the love, double the wisdom from both pairs of parents. Why do we have to take ownership of many things in life? if we don't, we are bound to have a greater expanse of joy and miracle. I believe that.",1522022400,,590,4.094827586206897
8712967,5,B00WERYXIW,"I watched a lot of movies on Amazon, this one is the only one I wanted to rate.  This is a great film.  Words can't describe how incredible it is.  Just got to watch it.",1519516800,,169,3.7714285714285714
8712968,5,B00WERYXIW,"Movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles.  Excellent story, acting, and direction.  Based on true events in China in which a boy was abducted.  His parents are divorced, and the mother who re-married blames the ex-husband for losing the child as he was the last to care for the kid.  Many children in China go missing just like they do in the United States.  The parents join a missing children's group to find peace and comfort in their minds while still in search of their children.  What's great about this movie is that it shows you the story behind the abductor's family as well as that of the abductee's family.  One would think that we would not care much about the abductor and only sympathize with the abductee; well, in this movie, you begin to sympathize with the abductor as well.  Human emotions are so complicated as everyone has a story as to why things happen the way they happen.  At the end of the movie, they show you the real families who dealt with the traumatic event.",1516665600,,993,4.533707865168539

We can also support those non-profit organization who help the sexual and human trafficking victims.  The non-profit, ""Love146"" is the wonderful organization that I support for this cause.

8712971,4,B00WERYXIW,"Wow, I read the reviews before I watched this movie and was so disappointed. It was a good movie, but it certainly wasn't the earth shattering, out of body experience, it was said to be. I must have watched a different movie than the other reviewers...or...I must not have a soul.",1516492800,,280,4.509803921568627
