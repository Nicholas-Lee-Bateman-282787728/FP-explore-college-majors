944099,1,6304978286,"Visually beautiful, but the movie bored me. I had a hard time getting through this movie. Everything about it was cheesy. Gurgi sounded like Gollum, the horn kings green assistant was a rip off of igor, and the whole movie felt rushed. Skip it.",1522108800,,244,4.568181818181818
944100,5,6304978286,"Excellent movie one of my absolute favorites from when I was a kid, that being said, despite being an animated Disney movie it's not super kid friendly  I remember my mom would cover my eyes at times watching this when I was little and watching it now as an adult I totally see why, this movie is actually pretty dark and terrifying for a Disney movie ( probably why I grew up to be such a bother lol). But they do a really amazing job of still having that cool whimsical fantasy feel while still having darker themes. Great movie! Just maybe keep it to older kids and teens ",1521504000,,575,4.26605504587156

944102,5,6304978286,"I don't even know where to begin. I wanted this movie on some format. I usually only buy Blu-ray & wouldn't buy DVD. But this was only released on DVD. All I could find on here was the 25th Anniversary edition for way too much money. I only found this out of Print Gold Collection one via a Google search. I couldn't find this searching inside Amazon. Bought 3rd party. Was $8 something including shipping. To my surprise in came unopened. I thought I was buying used. Needless to say, I can't open it now. It's out of print. So I guess you could say I couldn't be happier. I picked up a used copy of 25th anniversary edition at a store & I personally believe the artwork is cooler & better on the Gold Collection. Also it looks like the special features are almost identical. Each one has one thing the other doesn't. So it all works out. I highly recommend the Gold or Anniversary editions.",1520553600,,892,4.347305389221557

944106,5,6304978286,"A lost Disney classic! While not as well-known as other animated films from the House of Mouse, this spin on the Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander is darker than most Disney offerings. No sing-a-long songs, but the music by Elmer Bernstein was suitable for the tone of the movie. Younger children (or Disney fans expecting singing bunnies) might not appreciate the Black Cauldron for what it is...Disney's first PG rated animated film.",1519344000,,442,5.068493150684931

944159,5,6304978286,"One of my all time favorite Disney features, unlike anything else they've done. My only question...where's the Blu-ray? Evidently, it's being held hostage in the Disney vaults of ""political correctness"" with other classics like ""Song of the South.""",1517443200,,248,5.552631578947368

944161,1,6304978286,"Go buy the books and get the real story then watch it again. You'll hate it. Every person that gave it a 5 star rating has clearly not read the books. Dallben is not fat, and oh yah, where's the main bad guy Arawn Death-Lord, and Gwydion the hero in the first book. Missing a lot of good characters and character development. There's also a huge plot twist. That means, probably the first book minus half of the plot. Overall, Disney could've made a good movie, had they really tried, but they didn't.",1515542400,,501,4.397849462365591
944162,5,6304978286,It's just as I remembered when I was a kid.  Great movie!,1515283200,,57,3.75
944163,1,6304978286,"The only reason anyone likes this movie is because of nostalgia. It's terrible, the pacing sucks, all the characters are annoying and the plot makes almost zero sense. There's a reason this originally bombed at the box office.",1513900800,,226,4.973684210526316
944164,4,6304978286,"The phrase ""Cult Classic"" gets thrown around a lot these days. Usually, when you hear it, it's usually in reference to something campy and stupid that just happens to have a couple of things going for it (like good special effects or a creative storyline) that geeks like me appreciate too much to let said ""classics"" slide away into oblivion. Think Krull, or David Lynch's Dune.

The Black Cauldron, however, is fully deserving of the title. It's both totally unique in being an edgy, sword-and-sorcery story fit for a good DnD campaign - as brought to life by Disney animation, of all things - and legitimately good enough to justify a rewatch on a lazy Saturday afternoon when the kids are at a friend's and your wife is taking a nap. God knows, I didn't see it until I was seventeen; but my acne-riddled Dungeon-Master self fell in love with the parts featuring the Horned King and his wyvern/barbarian/draugr armies hunting down the generic teenage protagonist of his motley crew of barely-fleshed-out misfits and outcasts.

Now, for all its Low-Fantasy charms, this movie is still trying to be Disney film, and that's really where it all falters. Taran, the protagonist, is bland and colorless. I guess this was to make him easy for the desired teen audience to project themselves onto (God knows I would've, if I were a few years younger) but whenever the baddies take backstage, the film drags to a rock's pace and stays there for what feels like weeks. Eilonwy, his princess friend, is introduced without any real context and is equally bland; I guess Disney just requires a princess in just about everything, and she definitely feels like a last-minute add in. I'm given to understand she appears in the book this was based on, but a little more about Taran and Eilonwy's background and motivations combined with a great deal less about the washed-up minstrel and the obnoxious, daggers-in-your-ears sheepdog-creature that comes out of nowhere might've elevated the movie to truly great, 80's fantasy that the filmmakers were apparently going for. Detours dealing with meddlesome gnomes feel more like a poor Disney imitation, and the constant moodswings of the film's tone and jarring jumps from thrilling action setpieces to long, cutesy or lifeless sections throw off the pacing badly enough that many will lose interest before the film reaches its awesome (and awesomely violent, by Disney standards) climax.

Either way, if you can skip Gurgy's parts (as I do) and just sort of go with it, the Black Cauldron offers a great deal of charms; not the least of which is an amusing trio of witches who provide all the comic relief a story like this needs, and the beautifully animated sequences where wyverns attack, black magic is cast and dead warriors rise from their graves to wreak havoc in action scenes more than worthy of Heavy Metal, or Frank Frazetta. The Horned King himself is pure nightmare fuel, John Hurt's dried-out monotone giving the undead sorcerer an air of eeriness easily fit for the likes of EC horror comics. By the way, take the time to read that again: There is an undead sorcerer trying to raise an army of zombies in this Disney movie. If that doesn't take balls, I don't know what does.

It's a shame this movie didn't do better at the box office, or that the script couldn't be put through a few more rewrites. We could've had a long line of teen-oriented fantasy flicks out of Disney's talented animators: 'Disney's Conan' might sound moronic now, but a rewatch of Black Cauldron reveals that they could've pulled it off, if only it were financially viable for them to do so.

In short, it's a great window into a failed experiment with some incredible high points that merit at least one viewing for any fantasy/animation fans out there. I can't say it's a great movie, but for a little while at least it most definitely has some very great moments.",1513036800,,3891,4.8014925373134325

I bought a digital version from Amazon digital movies and it is in HD I believe. Well, better than the dvd. It is a must see! I find the negative comments disrespectful.

944257,1,6304978286,If you're looking for a movie that goes with the book this isn't it! This is a horrible adaptation of a good book. I was so excited to watch this since I loved The Chronicles of Prydain series only to be sorely disappointed. Disney made an absolute mess of a wonderful book by trying to stuff elements from all five books into the same movie. It's a true disservice to Lloyd Alexander's wonderful series and Disney really could have done better by simply sticking to the one book instead of mushing all of them together to make one movie.,1503792000,,538,4.444444444444445

944259,5,6304978286,"This movie came out almost ten years before I was born, but when I saw it on video, I loved it, and to this day it's one of my favorite animated films, right up there with The Last Unicorn, and almost everything I've ever watched from Studio Ghibli. I loved the characters, I thought the villain was pretty cool, and the idea of a magical cauldron that could be used to conquer the world was a new and exciting idea to me when I first heard it. A very highly underrated film when it was first released, I hope it continues to work toward getting the attention and adoration that I feel it deserves.",1502236800,,598,4.254385964912281
944260,2,6304978286,I would never watch this again. Sure it was darker than most disney but that's not where it went wrong. Characters are annoying and the ending so anti-climatic. If you remember the ending... I would have taken the sword back.,1502236800,,225,4.65

944328,2,6304978286,"This movie really struggles. As much as I am a big fan of staying true to the story, when making a movie the time constraints often make it unrealistic to include every detail. It takes an editorial eye to decide what is necessary to retain in order to keep the spirit of the story. While I have only read a small portion of the book, I can definitely tell that this movie suffers from trying to include too many ideas. I am left with so many questions at the end of this: What the heck is Eilonwy doing in the dungeon and who is she? Why does she have a random ball of light that mysteriously disappears only moments after introducing it? What is the purpose of the musician and his instrument? Why is there a magic sword underneath the castle? Etc. The result is that nothing is answered satisfactorily and you are left with a bunch of extremely wooden characters telling an extremely confused story.",1498780800,,902,4.4397590361445785

944331,5,6304978286,"I will star my review by saying I do not understand how anyone can give this movie a one star rating unless the copy the received was damaged, even then it's not the movie that's at fault but the manufacturer. Also anyone who is expecting this to be light, family fare fun for the littlest of tykes isn't paying attention to the PG RATING. Again, not the movie's fault. I can maybe see a four star or even a three star review from those who are really let down by their expectations of it being exactly like the books, maybe; but this is Disney after all and they Disneyfy EVERYTHING. Now onto my actual review of this movie, of course all reviews of content are always and only the viewer's opinion. This is by without a doubt my favorite animated Disney film, period. Does it take liberties with the story? Yes, see above. Is it free of annoying and unnecessary character singing? YES! Yay! Is the story engaging and fun? I definitely thought so when I saw it in the theater when it came out (I was 13) and think so now; I still watch it a couple of times a year. Now onto the actual physical product review, the picture quality of the DVD I purchased is quite high and the audio sounds great, the mix is well done. I saw a couple of reviews talking about a lack of special features my copy had several special features: character artwork, a couple of games, deleted scenes, I must have received a different release.",1495843200,,1418,4.375

944644,4,6304978286,"The Black Cauldron has one distinction that in most of the reviews leaves out. It was the last animated feature that Walt Disney had started work on before his death in 1966. It was shelved for nearly two decades, until it was found buried among the Disney archives. Brought out and work on again in the late 70's. Using the preliminary story boards and notes. That Walt had left behind. Historically the beginning 20 minutes of the film is in the true Walt Disney style, animation wise. So that truly makes it his Last film!
Other than that, it is a very unique story. And a true departure from the usual Disney fluff. No songs or silly dance numbers. In fact this film has a darkness factor that makes Snow White look sunny by comparison! Another unique feature of it is that, it can't be categorized as a boys or girls movie. It quest element in it. Which is led by a boy, but is spurred on a sort of princess. It is never revealed weather or not Ellowy is a real princess or just pretending to be one. But she is definitely not your average Disney princess! She's more of a tomboy than fluffy frilly Disney princess. I think this where the film departs from being the typical Walt Disney movie.
Girl characters in Disney's films weren't meant to so independent as the princess in this film. Taran the pig keeper is an ambitious kid. Much like Arthur in the Sword and the Stone. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a Disney collector. It's a very enjoyable film.",1467072000,,1474,4.422794117647059

945048,5,6304978286,"Some folks left a less than stellar review regarding the lack of special features on the DVD.  Yet, they missed the point entirely, IMHO.  I first watched Black Cauldron in theaters back when it was released in the summer of 1986.  I was an 8-year-old at the time.  This was the only Disney animated feature up to that time (and, I think, since) to be given a PG rating by the MPAA instead of the goodie-goodie G rating.  Keep in mind that the MPAA was more conservative through the Reagan years than they are today.  And, it deserves it.

Anyone who ever read the ""Chronicles of Prydain"" will tell you that the story is geared more towards teenagers and beyond.  Think of this series as JRR Tolken and CS Lewis meets Edgar Allen Poe.  The film is not near as dark as the books; and, Disney did take some artistic license with the film to present it towards children and pre-teens.  (For instance, the character Gurgi is presented as a cute mammalian gopher kind of creature where in the book he was presented as a huge troll-like being whom smelled powerfully [though, Fleuder-Flam does refer to Gurgi as ""pugent""].  Obviously, Disney was going after the cuteness factor.  And it worked!  At age 8, I would identify with the Disney version before the literary one.)

It was a ballsy leap by Disney at the time to release a film with this type of plot; for, their features were rote and had a reputation for fun, feel-good, family romps.  (Think Sword in the Stone, Cinderella as well as the hybrids like Pete's Dragon.)  But, this one feature was different.  Several of the animators had worked on United Artists' ""Secret of NIMN"" back in 1982 - and it showed.  NIMN was also quite dark.  Disney hoped to target an older crowd (13-18) in an attempt to bring in that demographic.  Unfortunately, it blew-up in their face.

Back then, I remember my mother being seriously ticked-off by this movie, as she had no idea it was so dark and foreboding.  ""Here come the nightmares,"" she thought.  And, after what my parents went through with me after I watched ""Poltergeist"" on HBO that night a couple years before this, I wouldn't blame her! :-P  But, I actually liked Black Cauldron.  It would not be released on video until the turn of the Century, however.

Disney did a very good job of finding enough of a balance that both those 7-18 and adults would find it a good experience, especially members of the ""Lord of the Rings"" crowd.  The ending (no spoilers) regarding Gurgi - and Taran's reaction to it - was so not Disney.  And THAT is what made the film so special, and made me identify with the characters so deeply.  But, hang in there.  Disney will throw the kids a bone - it will be happy, soon.  Yet, it was very fast-paced and hokey.

Technically speaking, there were good and bad things regarding the production of this feature.  On the good side, this was the first Disney feature to FINALLY be presented in Dolby Surround, instead of the very dated RCA-Victor.  The theatrical version contained six tracks of audio - Front L and R, Rear L and R, and Between L and R (Similar to the THX Format).  This would set the stage for the wonderful and rich-sounding tracks of ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Lion King,"" and all those after them.  Thankfully, the DVD's (The 1999 release and then this one) artfully represent the theatrical Dolby Surround soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1.  And, it works well.

This feature was also originally shot in 60mm (similar to TODD-AO), instead of the standard 45mm.  This makes the film wider than the standard 16x9 ratio we think of, today.  This was only the second film to that time that was shot in 60 when it was released in theaters in 1986 - Fantasia being the first, I think.  And, thankfully, it was presented in Anamorphic Widescreen for the 25th Anniversary DVD Release.  (The 1999 release was presented in 60mm; however, it was Letterboxed instead of Anamorphic - would not fit the entire screen on a 16x9 television set.)

Disney mixed several special colors for this film - most notably the ""radioactive green"" used for the birth of the cauldron born.  Also, several unique reds were used when the powers of the cauldron were ultimately stopped.  The soundtrack was SUPERB, and was conducted by Elmer Berstein - the same musician who conducted the soundtrack for ""The Ten Commandments"" in 1956, as well as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and even ""Ghostbusters.""  The orchestration of ""The Black Cauldron"" is truly one of his best, most rare works.  And, being presented in Dolby Surround was the true icing on the cake!

But with the good also came the bad.  This film had some downright sloppy animation in it - especially towards the beginning during the first seen in Kal Dahlbin (the farm).  Not since the ""shimmering cape"" on the prince in Sleeping Beauty (back in the 1950's) did these errors show back up.  It could be excused when the full-color animated features appeared less than 10 years ago at that time - but certainly not in 1986!  The 25th Anniversary DVD *DID* clean that problem up successfully, however.  If you have the 1999 DVD or VHS tape, you will see what I am talking about.  Finally, the plot seemed a tad too rushed, especially towards the end.  But, it still worked.

The bottom line is if you love epic fantasy plots like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit, you will also love The Black Cauldron.  (If your kids are old enough to watch LOR or HP, they can handle TBC, as well.  After all, I did as an 8-year-old in the mid-eighties.)  The Black Cauldron holds a special place in my heart, as I am of Welsh ancestry.  (The author - Lloyd Alexander, who was also Welsh - placed the story in Wales.)  But, if you are looking for a feel-good typical ""put it in to shut the kids up"" Disney flick, this ain't it.  The Black Cauldron truly is a very unique cult classic.",1429660800,2,5848,4.5805207328833175

945266,3,6304978286,"How many writers does it take to screw up The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander?  Nine.  And a very angry Disney studio chairman (Jeffrey Katzenberg) who took matters in his own hands and tried to edit out everything he thought was offensive.  Ultimately, 12 minutes were removed from the movie involving the Fairfolk, some graphic violence, and partial nudity.  Very little of what remains has any actual bearing on Alexander's award winning series.  At the time of its release, The Black Cauldron was one of the most expensive animated films ever made.  It was a box office disaster.  Fan requests were responsible for its eventual release on VHS in 1998.  It was never considered Disney Studio's finest effort (even the animators were disappointed with the results).  The Black Cauldron was a great opportunity missed through gross incompetence and not a little manhandling by people who didn't appreciate the subject matter and thought by tampering with it they could somehow make it better.  Read the books instead.

Besides the dubious distinction of being a box office bomb, The Black Cauldron is also noted for being one of the first animated films to utilize CGI (the floating orb of light, the cauldron, bubbles, and a boat).  They also used live action footage of dry ice mist for the smoke that pours out of the cauldron.  (When the Disney people fail it's almost always a result of bad story telling, their artwork is consistently exemplary.)

I have a love/hate attitude towards this movie because I am such a fan of the Prydain books.  It's not that it's a terrible movie per se; it's just inconsistent in tone (trying to be dark and funny).  Sometimes it's a tad too cute and precious (""who's your pungent little friend?""), sometimes it's a little too grim (""I'm sure you've murdered for less."").

In a modern light, it's tough to see what all the fuss was about. A few marching skeletons? A bit of swordplay? It all seems so quaint now, with the benefit of hindsight on our side. Not that the film should be mentioned in the same breath as the studio's calling cards, of course. It's short, shallow and more than a little murky, with a distinct lack of Disney charm, but it still has a lot going for it. The animation, for instance, is superb - a great blend of photo-reference and vivid exaggeration that looks and feels like a Don Bluth classic (though Bluth himself, having departed six years prior, was uninvolved with the production). It also enjoys a much more loyal fantasy tone than many of Disney's efforts, sharing many themes (and maybe a few characters) with the then-neglected Lord of the Rings trilogy. Fascinating for many reasons, most of which occur behind the scenes, it's too narrow-sighted and streamlined to be taken all that seriously.",1414540800,2,1090,4.803191489361702

945325,2,6304978286,"Taking place in a Lord of the Rings-esque setting, Taran (Grant Bardsley) is an ""assistant pig keeper"" who dreams of being a great warrior. The owner of the farm he works at, Dallben (Freddie Jones), learns that the evil Horned King (John Hurt) is out to get the Black Cauldron and intends to use its powers for nefarious purposes. Taran realizes his chance to go on a quest and save the entire kingdom.

I have not read the books in which this movie is based on (and likely never will), so my thoughts are about just the film. I thought the film was problematic for a few reasons. The first major reason was lame characters. The protagonist, Taran, is about as bland as can be with little personality. Gurgi (John Byner) was annoying and borderline unintelligible. Fflewddur Fflam (Nigel Hawthorne) just seemed to take up space and added little to the story. The story itself was disjointed and episodic. Stuff just seemed to happen with little reason. The animation was mixed. Although there were some pretty good sequences and well-made backgrounds, other times it almost felt like one step above a Saturday morning cartoon.

In the Disney animated canon, The Black Cauldron today seems like the black sheep of the bunch and probably the most obscure major Disney film. Infamously, when the film was first released in 1985 it was met with mixed reviews and was a box office failure. For Disney enthusiasts, the film is worth checking out as a rather bizarre chapter in Disney animation history. For more casual movie goers that just like the Disney classics, you might as well pass it up.",1409270400,,1591,4.760869565217392

For those of you who say that you should not let children watch it because it is too scary, dark, etc. I would advise you to understand that children need not be coddled as they can appreciate a movie without it being, as another review put it, ""filler crap"" like most movies today. I remember seeing this movie as a young child and loved it. I think today's society really fails to realize the importance all types of emotions have on children. Thank goodness I am a 90s baby. Back then, we could still watch Gremlins, the Princess and the Goblin(another thrilling children's movie), and the Black Cauldron and still turn out emotionally stable. I would recommend this movie anytime. Not because it is the best movie, but because it is so refreshing and a break from all the current Disney movies that mesh with each other so you can't tell which movie you are actually watching anymore.

945398,4,6304978286,"""The Black Cauldron"" is like an unloved stepchild in Disney's library of animated features. Its troubled production is a well-known story to film industry fans, highlighted by studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg going on a power trip and performing amputations on the nearly-completed picture, removing some of its darker scenes. The film lost money at the box office and has since received so little promotion that casual Disney fans don't even know it exists. While it's easy to downplay its importance as a Disney animated classic, the movie remains notable as a straight-forward fantasy adventure. At the time of its release, the production values made it one of the classiest sword & sorcery films, and it stands the test of time by still being enjoyable today.

The story: an evil, magical cauldron is sought by the demonic Horned King (John Hurt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Elephant-Man/dp/B00AEFXV3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Elephant Man</a>) in his quest for world domination, and the only ones standing in his way are an odd band led by a teenaged farmhand eager for adventure (Grant Bardsley).

My initial impression of the movie was that it seemed as though Disney decided to produce a screenplay that was written without animation in mind: the lack of musical numbers, its gothic design, and the focus on horror-esque elements are about as un-Disney-ish as you can get while retaining the PG rating. Examination of the credits reveals that while the writers were all Disney regulars, there were a whopping nine of them working on the story, with an extra nine others credited for additional dialogue and ""additional story contributions."" This doesn't explain the unconventionally dark tone, but it does provide a possible reason for what I consider to be the film's only true weakness: a feeling of clutter, with a few too many characters and events going on in too short an amount of time (thanks, Katzenberg).

Stylistically, the film reminds me a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleeping-Beauty/dp/B0013ND30M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleeping Beauty</a>, another medieval fantasy with a definite dark side to it. As a matter of fact, I'm a little confused as to why the content of ""Black Cauldron"" was considered controversial when ""Sleeping Beauty"" had an equally creepy villain (more on him soon), scary dragons, impish minions, etc. It may just be the Horned King's necromancy, or the choice to score the scenes of the lumbering skeletons without adrenalizing bellicose music, creating a spookier effect. Whatever the case, the look of the movie is great. While not quite the epic scale that Disney may have been aiming for, there are enough scenes of innocent wonder and comedy to satisfy younger kids (e.g. the fairy cave) while the darker imagery makes it equally palatable to an older crowd. The scene of the dragons attacking feels as though it came right out of a Don Bluth movie, with claustrophobic backgrounds and an unsettling point-of-view shot of a dragon's claws opening towards its target.

Speaking of dragons, another reason that the film is likely to appeal to an older, more fantasy-centric crowd is the amount of action in the picture. I can't exactly call it action-packed, but it's definitely got more adrenaline scenes in it than the Disney flicks that chronologically bookend it, and would arguably be Disney's most exciting film in this regard until&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rescuers-Down-Under/dp/B00004R99O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rescuers Down Under</a>&nbsp;debuted. Equally underrated is the strength of its characters. While the main hero is rather bland, others make up for him, particularly the pro-active young princess (Susan Sheridan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mermaid-Forest/dp/B000GFLKH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mermaid Forest</a>) who's definitely more suited to the leading role, and the forest creature Gurgi (John Byner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silk-Stalkings/dp/B0007WQGVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silk Stalkings</a>) who's like a cuddly version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gollum/dp/B00HFFE8HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gollum</a>. But definitely the most memorable character is the Horned King, whose demonic design, chilling voice, and calculating demeanor make him the most directly devilish character in the Disney canon since the monster in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia</a>. He suffers from a lack of memorable lines and standout moments (SPOILER: besides having the skin sucked off of him in the end), but the sheer strength of his character design makes him unforgettable.

Supposedly, test presentations of the film in early 1985 had angry parents leaving the theater with traumatized children in tow, but from my own experience, my six- and five-year-old cousins declared the movie ""awesome"" after seeing it for the first time, so perhaps a few generations of development in pop culture have better prepared young viewers to receive the film. But, like I said, I think the ideal audience for the picture are slightly more experienced fantasy fans, who will appreciate the monomythic story structure and more mature tone. Personally, I'm grateful to the filmmakers for managing to get this one made when they did. I would love to see an entirely uncut version of the movie, but in lieu of this, its established form is still very good. Sword & sorcery fans and die-hard Disney devotees should pick it up.",1405555200,4,5805,6.083028083028083

This isn't meant to be a Disney ""princess"" movie...this is more of a boy's tale, although I'm a grown woman who loves it. The babies out there who complain and compare Gurgi to Gollum are very ignorant. The two are nothing alike. Gollum is a cowardly villain; Gurgi becomes the biggest hero in this film. I'm sure these same complainers love ""Beauty and the Beast"", a highly rated and praised Disney film, yet for me, THAT is far more dark and disturbing.

As for this movie, I never read the book this movie is based on, so I had no expectations about it. The story is about a pig keeper named Taran who has to save the world from a black cauldron after the evil Horned King gets hold of it. There is some darkness about it, but there's also an unexpected twist to make the happy ending more complete than it would've been.

This movie came out in 1985, at the height of the '80s ""satanic panic""; parents saw some of the images and didn't take their kids to see this, nor did they think it was appropriate, and as a result, this movie bombed out at the box office. I don't know what age group should see this, but I do know that the fears of witchcraft and sorcery are ridiculous; this is a film that very much encourages and demonstrates good, heroism and ""doing the right thing"" in the boy and his friends, and they emerge victorious at the end. I think kids SHOULD see this precisely because of those latter things; the dark spots in the movie are brief and weak, and not that scary at all. There are no ""blood and guts"" gross moments in this movie. Its bad reputation is very undeserved. This is a film with great moral lessons such as love, friendship, loyalty, teamwork and sacrifice. Anyone who refuses to let their kids watch this because of the perceived ""darkness"" of it or because THEY don't like it are making their kids miss out on a great film.",1404432000,,1965,4.410468319559229

I get that it is never really possible to have a movie recreate a book perfectly, but Disney TORE THE PLOT TO PIECES. A few character names and the title were all that even resembled the book. I know a Disney movie is not going to show an animated war with everyone dying or betraying each other, but then they should not even have tried to make it a cartoon in the first place. Pride, betrayal, war, sacrifice,  redemption. These were things that my 8 year old self could understand as far as literature was concerned. Why would you omit these things from a story, particularly when they are some of the key parts.

Regardless of my biased opinion, as a stand alone Disney creation, it is very quaint. Go for it. If you have read the books by Lloyd Alexander,  do not hope for quality.",1389916800,,1046,4.348717948717948

945634,4,6304978286,"Disney Studios 25th full length animated feature film. The Black Caldron is one of Disney's different efforts, for one it is not a musical. This is another decent entry in the Disney animated film cannon with great animation and dramtic use of color and wonderful backgrounds, but the films after Sleeping Beauty just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to in the early days.

While this isn't Disney's best, it is an enjoyable and pretty solid film. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new animation process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone.  The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style.

OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and the 25th anniversary DVD is far and away the best choice. The first release was released in full screen and fortunately the 25th anniversary edition is presented in 2:35:1 the correct aspect ratio. It would be nice to see this film on Blu Ray as the 25th DVD looks and sounds great. The extras are very thin with a stills gallery, lost scene and nothing more really worth mentioning. Why can't we get a making of for each of these films? Is it too much to ask to have some insight on these ""animated classic"" even if only 15-20 minutes long?

They also deleted a bunch of scenes that were too graphic like one of the undead slicing a mans neck and torso and a man being desolved by the mist which they will probably never feature under the deleted scenes. I bet a live action movie would be creepy as hell! It was based on the series chronicles of prydain but in it the horned king was just a man and not even the main bad guy at that, so disney's version of him was way coole! But it seems they couldn't  develop the characters to make them interesting enough to care about them. My favorite characters included the horned king, creeper, gurgi and Fflewddur with his mandoline. So that pretty much tells you something because Taran and Eilonwy are suppose to be the main characters especially Taran and you don't seem to care about them really.

What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

The Black Cauldron - we own the original DVD release from 2000... why they released on DVD and not Blu Ray in 2012, I'll never know - we would have upgraded in a hot second!

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
A young assistant pig-keeper, Taran, is charged with protecting a fantastically magical porker Hen Wen (and she's SOOOME PIG) by pig owner and local enchanter Dallben.  It seems the war lord known simply as the Horned King - a super spooky skeleton with a bad temper - is on the hunt for the mystical Black Cauldron, a magical pot which can return the dead to gainful employment in his evil army.  Dallben orders Taran to keep Hen Wen safe so naturally Taran loses sight of her in the first few minutes to the Horn King's minions.  Taran risks life and limb to rescue his pig meeting several new friends along the way... the adverse smelling Gurgi, the lovely and ever-perky Princess Eilonwy, the melody-changed bard Fflewddur Fflam, and the Fairy King Eidilleg.  Bad fortune and bad luck result in our band of heroes gaining a fantastic magic sword which they traded to three witches for the cauldron itself, only to discover they can't do anything with the cauldron and eventually losing control of the cauldron to the Horned King (and nearly their lives).  An unprecedented act of heroics saves the day and restores peace to the land.

Disney's 25th feature film was seriously panned by critics and became a financial disaster... what is The Black Cauldron?  It's a hole Disney threw money in.  Lacking the charm and general sense of well-being ubiquitous in their other offerings, this more serious story failed to find wide acceptance.  As for me, I loved the movie and found Disney's plunge into darker story lines a refreshing change of pace and showed the company was capable of a greater degree of art than simply popcorn flicks and musicals.  The scenes dealing with the Fairy Folk are particularly enchanting - probably the most Disney-esque of the entire flick.  Perhaps if they had stuck closer to the original book they would have found greater success?  Who knows  - what I can say is this DVD has graced our shelves for more than a decade and we pull it down fairly regular.  Little Miss Movie Dude commented that when she was younger the movie scared the ""ba-gee-bees"" out of her but now she can appreciate the seriously great animation and the weaving of Welsh mythology with pure modern fantasy.

What I loved:
~ Dark and brooding, the story was a departure from more bubble-gum fluff-bunny Disney-fare
~ Incredible animation from start to finish, this is one of the final films Disney put out pre-CGI films which sought to WOW us with the artistry of cell animation
~ Little Miss Movie Dude loves all the magic in the film, she felt totally immersed and a genuine sense of wonder at all the magical goings on and items

What I did NOT like:
~ The story feels a little rough and choppy at times, I understand it went thru some last minute editing but I felt like was missing some of the polish and shine I'd expect from Disney
~ The subject matter is very dark, and while I loved the film, I would probably caution families with small children to preview it first

That being said, it also has fairies, a cute magical pig, and a happy ending the whole family can enjoy.  It was also fun to discover that John Hurt played the voice of the main villain?  The same man that was Mr. Ollivander in Harry Potter and the lovable Narrator in the original Storyteller (another classic).  The film did have a few questionable aspects, slow points, and oddities; and we could not help but compare the character Gurgi to the Lord of the Rings Gollum in every way (voice, movement/mannerisms, and the final fall).

945721,3,6304978286,"(Done as an extensive summary review, with commentary. Spoilers follow.)

On a whim, I decided to take a look at one of Disney's more infamous endeavors, the 1985 film The Black Cauldron. I was curious about this film because it has a reputation for being one of, if not the worst animated films in the Walt Disney Animated Classics line. Granted it was the first animated Disney film to get a PG rating, so it's definitely a deviation from the norm, but that doesn't mean it's terrible ... right? Nonetheless, I went into it with an open mind. I did not come out as such.

As one of the many aspects of this film's unusual nature, is based on a series of fantasy novels rather than Disney's usual go-to gag of common fairytales. The Black Cauldron is based on the first two entries in the series of novels known as The Chronicles of Prydain, published from 1964 to 1968, the first being The Book of Three and the other being The Black Cauldron itself. That being said, I cannot in any way comment on this film on its merits or faults as an adaptation, seeing as how I have never read this particular series of books, nor had I even heard of it before researching this film. So, I will just have to take this film as it is. Still, the fact that I had never even heard of this film's basis cannot possibly be a good sign.

The overall plot of this film is as basic and unenlightened as it could possibly get. The opening narration gives us a standard back story of some ancient evil sealed away in the mystic ""MacGuffin,"" the Black Cauldron. We then moved to the Shire standard farmstead, where we see the standard young and inexperienced wannabe hero, Luke Taran. He is being looked over by Obi-Wan Kenobi Gandalf Dallben. For the record, I'll say that Dallben's voice, provided by Freddie Jones, sounds fairly strained, but perhaps maybe they were going for to give him more of a venerated feel, or possibly it just might be the limitations of the recording equipment of the mid-80s. Speaking of that, this film actually feels a lot older than it actually is, like it's contemporary with films like The Sword in the Stone and The Jungle Book, despite the fact that it's actually nearly 20 years older than those films. The animation style of this film is sketchy, like it's not fully polished, which was common in previous decades, but should have been phased out by this time. It's decent, but nowhere near impressive. Characters and moving objects stand out too much from the backgrounds; I even know which rocks they will step on. Perhaps this is a frame rate or conversion issue, but it does bear noticing. For the most part, the backgrounds do look nice and well-painted, but they're not that noteworthy.

Back to the actual plot, or what little there is. Taran's main job is to take care of Hen Wen, a magical pig that can see visions of the future when she sees her reflection in water . . . Okay. Weird, but I have heard of weirder. How or why she has this power is never explained though, something you'll find to be a recurring trope in this film, unfortunately. Taran dreams of being a great hero and is tired of his life on the farm, much like every other young hero and every other fantasy tale ever written. He gets his chance when Hen Wen sees a vision of the Horned King during one particular acid water trip. The Horned King is a mixed character, in my opinion. He can be scary looking, especially for small children, seeing as how he looks like a cross between Skeletor and a Ringwraith with deer antlers. His voice can also be intimidating, seeing as how it is provided by the legendary John Hurt, and there is a frightening error about him, especially in the way that he's talked about and how his minions fear his wrath. However, there doesn't seem to be anything particularly impressive about his actual being; he doesn't seem like a particularly strong or powerful villain, but were supposed to just believe that he is one were told so. Also, exactly who or what he is, and where he came from are never really elaborated upon. All that we do know, is that he is evil and wants to take over the world with an army of the undead (yeah, zombies in a Disney movie), and in order do that, he needs the Black Cauldron, which has been lost for centuries. At any rate, Taran now has to take Hen Wen to the safe haven of It-Doesn't-Matter-Because-They're-Obviously-Never-Going-To-Get-There.

So Taran takes Hen Wen into the nearby woods, where he spends most of his time on daydreaming about being a great hero some more. I must say that Taran seems far more full of himself and much less competent than other heroes in his position from other tales. He boasts with the ego of a professional wrestler, yet we've never actually seen him do anything. Moreover, he screws up at the first chance he gets as Hen Wen disappears while he is busy fantasizing. As if that wasn't bad enough, he then meets Gurgi, our Gollum impersonator for the evening. Gurgi is much more annoying than most fantasy companions, like almost Jar Jar level annoying. His voice and manner of speech does sound very much like Gollum's, but it's somehow much more grating and gets on your nerves very fast. They find Hen Wen, but she is quickly captured by the Horned King's dragon minions. Gurgi points Taran in the direction of the Horned King's castle, but is too scared to go with him. I must say that Taran is unusually harsh on a creature he just met in this scene, seeing as how it's mostly his fault that bad stuff happened anyway; it doesn't give the audience much sympathy for a hero that is so callous to others.

Taran gets to the castle. The animation of this scene, which you can practically play ""Cantina Jizz"" to like any other bar scene in fantasy stories, is oddly fluid and chaotic; doesn't match the rest of the picture very well. Again, Taran takes another step down in the minds of the audience, as his bravado falls at his first confrontation with the Horned King. So much for all that boasting. However, I will grant that he at least gets Hen Wen out of the castle, but by throwing her off a balcony into the moat, so he can't even do that right. He's thrown in the dungeon, but he quickly meets a young girl named Princess Eilonwy, who frees him from his cell and then explore the dungeons together, looking for an exit. Princess Eilonwy is another character that I'm not sure how I feel about. She seems a bit too unconcerned or absent-minded, and I can't put my finger on it, but she doesn't seem likable like, say, Alice was. She seems like an active sort of Princess, in that she is trying to do things for herself, but like Taran, she doesn't seem very capable. Also, she has some magic light ball Navi thing that follows her around. What it is, what it does, where it came from, also never brought up. And another thing, no mention of her royal family, or her kingdom for that matter, are ever made, so there is not much point to her being a princess other than just for the sake of being a princess in a Disney movie; she could just as easily been a laundry made in the story would be no different. Anyway, the pair also find a trapped bard, named Fflewddur Fflam (which is a stupid name), who is only mildly annoying. His voice actor, Nigel Hawthorne, would later do much better work for Disney as Professor Porter in Tarzan. Taran also comes across a magical Excalibur-like sword in a tomb, which can apparently cut through anything and they use it to escape the castle. Again, where the sword came from and why it was in the Horned King's dungeon is never addressed. This new development only serves to inflate Taran's ego to Kanye West-level proportions, but at least it Eilonwy is practical and sees that the sword did all the work. Taran is like this and lashes out verbally at her with some s very sexist remarks. Wow, Taran is a jerk. I'm rooting for him less and less as this movie goes on, if I ever was to begin with. Also, they meet up with Gurgi again. Oh, joy.

Next, they encounter these fairy/Smurf things called Fair Folk, who happen to have recovered Hen Wen. Well, that's a convenient deus ex machine, isn't it? I will point out that the young Fair Folk are actually voiced by children, which is a point for authenticity, but they clearly don't know what they're doing, and thus don't do a very good job acting; it's clear that they're reading, and not very well at that. I can't really blame them though, seeing as how they're just kids, but this is noticeable and distracting enough to bear mentioning. The Fair Folk say that they'll take Hen Wen back to the farm, and that's the last we ever see of her, so a lot of good her character did, aside from just instigate the plot. One of these Fair Folk agreed to escort the group to the location of the Black Cauldron. So where has this Black Cauldron, this incredibly dangerous evil artifact of unbelievable power, been hidden for all this time? In some cave, guarded by a monster? In a distant temple, surrounded by dozens of traps? Nope. Some witches had it in the back of their house, which is in some swamp. Kind of a letdown. These three witches (who obviously are analogs of the three witches in the opening scene of Macbeth) agreed to trade the Black Cauldron for Taran magic sword, who is obviously reluctant to part with the only thing that is given him any sort of credibility, but he eventually agrees to make the trade. Wow, it was so hard to obtain that inconceivably dangerous apocalyptic evil artifact, like bargaining at a swap meet. The witches cackle and say that the Black Cauldron will be of no use to them, because it is indestructible and the only way to stop it is to sacrifice someone who's willing to jump in. Well, that's a bit of a downer. At any rate, they still have to keep the black cauldron out of the hands of the Horned King, so obviously they try to hide it or something, right? Nope. They just sit there. They make a campfire and roast marshmallows and mope. Our heroes, everybody! So proactive! So, obviously the Horned King's goons come in and take it without much of a fuss. Seriously, what are these people good for? They've done essentially nothing for the entire film! Taran whines that he's nothing without his magic sword. Well, he's right, but for some inexplicable reason, Eilonwy says that she believes in him. Why? He has never given her, or us as the audience for that matter, any reason to believe that he's capable of anything at any point in this film. At any rate, they head back to the Horned King's castle.

Back at the castle, the horned King has activated the Black Cauldron. Green smoke flows out of it and animates his army of dead soldiers. I will say that this scene is pretty cool. There was very early CGI effects done on the cauldron and the smoke, and it looks very impressive for the time, almost photogenic. Also, I can see why this film got a PG rating; the images of the rotting undead minions, oozing blood and lava, rising up and marching would definitely frighten younger viewers, but adults would find it pretty cool. The Horned King exclaims he's moments away from victory. Why would he think that? His army hasn't done anything yet; they haven't conquered anyone or anything, and they haven't even gone a hundred yards outside of the castle. At any rate, the group gets to the Cauldron (which is completely unguarded for some stupid reason) and Taran, to his little credit, seems willing to jump in and sacrifice himself to stop it, but Gurgi rushes ahead and beats him to it. Yes! At least that annoying furball was good for something. So, the Horned King's plan is thwarted and his undead army collapses before it's barely even out of the gate. You know, for all that the Black Cauldron was built up to be, it doesn't really do anything, and moreover, it stopped unusually simply, so this thing doesn't amount to much in any respect for all its foreshadowing. I will say that in this scene, the Horned King gets angry and his eyes turn red with narrow black dots for pupils, and I must admit that he is much scarier and cooler-looking like this. His death is also disgustingly simple; he's sucked into the cauldron and melts into it, sort of like the Ark of the Covenant from Raiders of the Lost Ark, only in reverse.

As typical of evil villain lairs, as soon as the final boss is defeated, the whole place collapses/self-destructs for no reason. The three humans rush to escape the castle through the moat in the dungeon. There's a particularly bad edit in this sequence. There way is blocked by a gate, so Taran gets out of their boat to open it, but in the very next shot, the gate is closed again. When Taran opened it, it was lightly colored because he was interacting with it, but in the next shot, it's part of the painted background of the antecedent shot. It'll make you do a double-take. At any rate, they all escape unscathed, naturally. The witches from earlier suddenly reappear and offer to take the Black Cauldron off of their hands, seeing as how it is of no use to anyone anymore. Fflewddur Fflam, in literally the only useful thing he's done in this film, insists that they trade for it. The head witch reluctantly offers Taran his magic sword back in exchange for the cauldron, but all he wants is his friend Gurgi back. The witches say that such a feat is impossible, so they obviously then immediately proceed to do it. So that annoying furball is alive again, just when you thought you got rid of him, Taran and Eilonwy obligatorily kiss because the scripts demands it, and they all live happily ever after, with Dallben and Hen Wen, who have been entirely useless throughout this entire film, look on.

The DVD extras are there, and that's all I can really say about them. There are a couple of point-and-click games with trivia and very simple puzzles, which are extraordinarily easy; it might entertain a five-year-old for a few minutes but won't do anything for anybody else. There is an old Donald Duck Halloween cartoon short included, and that's pretty good, for what it's worth. There is a deleted scene, but unfortunately, it's not from any of the 12 minutes that were supposedly cut from this film postproduction personally by Jeffrey Katzenberg. Instead it's just another partially animated storyboard animatic from the Fair Folk scene, which I found to be disappointing in light of what could have very easily been an extensive deleted scenes extra.

Overall, everything about this film screams average, and the low end of average at that. The story just seems to sort of happen to the characters, rather than the characters driving the plot. Nobody seems very active. The story itself is the classic fantasy hero's journey that we've all seen a hundred times before, and it doesn't really bring anything new to the formula to justify its own existence. A lot of the characters and objects function only as plot devices, and are not very well explained or elaborated upon. The main hero isn't particularly skilled or even likable, the side characters are mostly useless and kind of annoying, and the villain is kind of good but it only serves to illuminate that he could've been much better. For a Disney film, I was very underwhelmed by this film. The animation isn't stellar or amateur, it's just average; its characters are not outright good and interesting or even bad, just average; the plot also isn't particularly innovative or negatively derivative, it's just average. And for Disney, average means ""skip it,"" and you should skip this film. The Disney studios have done much better before this film and after it. Unless you really want to have a complete Disney Animated Classics collection, you aren't really missing much if you leave this one out of it.",1373500800,,15759,4.557163020465773

Granted, The Horned King scared me to no end when I was small, but that's part of what drew me to love it so much; I grew up watching it at least once a year after I first saw it to see when I could stand to watch the parts with him without hiding behind a pillow or something for ""protection.""

The artistry is beautiful, the voices great. I adore the outfits and landscape, even the annoyance of the witches of Morva. The music is lovely, though with children nowadays it will be hard to keep them still through this movie without having them predisposed to others like it; otherwise, they'll want to the lyrics in their songs to keep the occupied and they'll be missing out on a true classic.

Despite my dislike for this being mostly based off of the second book in Lloyd Alexander's The Chronicles of Prydain, I can't stop loving it. Gurgi is adorable, Taran loveable, Princess Eilonwy feisty and still my favorite princess that's not in Disney's official ten. I wish they could have told us more about Fflewdurr like in the books instead of leaving him as comic relief, but at least there's mystery around his harp.

945863,5,6304978286,"We all know that this movie was a huge flop for Disney back in 1985. I believe it was ahead of its time. It's a Dark Fantasy movie at a time when people weren't really into Dark Fantasy (and wouldn't until things like the Lord of The Rings movie trilogy and Game of Thrones would release 20-30 years later.) It was a PG Disney Movie back when Disney was synonymous with G rated family affairs. There's no musical numbers in it back when most animated movies had at least one.

Had this movie released towards the late 90's or early 2000's it probably would have met with way more success. It's a great movie. Disney's quality animation doesn't disappoint. The voice acting is great. It is however very dark, and not appropriate for young children. But any lovers of Fantasy, or classic 2D animated Disney Movies should seriously consider this. It's a great movie. I only just saw it recently after remembering the commercials for it way back in 1985. It has held up incredibly well. Enough to warrant me buying it on DVD.

945976,3,6304978286,"Recently my husband and I were discussing the Disney movies we grew up with, so I was searching out the ones we didn't own and found The Black Cauldron for a good price ($12 with Prime). He'd never seen it, so I ordered it.

Both of us have read the Prydain series of books by Lloyd Alexander, multiple times although it's been at least a decade for both of us, so he knew going in that it was based on those, but people should be mindful that this is Disney - there are lots of liberties taken with the story. I saw this movie, I believe, in the theater, when I was pretty young. I may also have had a copy recorded off the Disney channel back in the day, although I honestly can't remember. Regardless, I knew what I was getting into, but my husband didn't beyond what the cover shows. He didn't hate the movie by any means, but it's quite different from the books, so that's something new viewers should keep in mind.

For all that, I think it's a pretty fun tale if you can ignore the differences. It's fairly typical Disney, although the princess at least rescues the 'hero' this time around. One major thing to keep in mind though is that this movie has SKELETONS in it. Lots of them, and they are reanimated by a necromancer. If you have young children who get scared by movies, DO NOT show this to them. I can imagine a lot of nightmares coming from the experience. I'd think maybe kids over eight or nine would be fine, depending on their usual viewing fare, but use your own judgement.

Again this is based on the books, so the skeletons are not really something Disney could ignore. I also noticed something during a  scene with a 'gypsy' type lady dancing on a table, in the midst of a bunch of barbarians. While it's only a split second, she flashes her panties when her skirt flies up. There's also a fair amount of sword/axe fighting and physical action.

I read online that this was actually the first movie Disney put CGI effects into, which are interesting since they're mostly 'vapor', but they are green and glowing which is kind of cool. Nothing special by modern standards, but pretty neat when you think about the older movies appearance. I also read that it was basically a box office flop, which I think is kind of a shame. I remember loving this movie as a kid. As an adult I am more critical of it, but I still enjoyed watching it again. It's kind of an oddball amongst the Disney library, but worth a look in my opinion.

The DVD version, by the way, is a pretty good transfer in my opinion. I'm not a technophile, but we do have a 55"" LED/LCD Samsung television with a bluray player, so bad transfers are pretty obvious. I thought this one was decent. The only thing I noticed was the bard's voice (I can't spell his name off the top of my head) - anyway his voice sounded a bit distant from the microphone. However, this may in fact be our television as it has occasionally glitched on audio channels until we've turned it off and back on again, which we didn't do. So don't let that dissuade you from checking this out if you can get a good deal.",1350691200,6,3077,4.324090121317158

946096,4,6304978286,"It apparently took over 12 years to make this movie, it was also left on the shelf for being too dark. It's an unusual make for Disney, coming from Lloyd Alexander's 'Chronicles of Prydain' novels. First, I have to say, I love the 'darker' animation - John Hurt voices a really sinister 'Horned King'. Taran, the pig keeper and would be hero, and Eilonwy, the princess, are somewhat different to the usual Disney heroes - wholesome, yes, but it's Taran who is stereotyped here, very much a twin to Wart in Sword in the Stone. Eilonwy escapes the fate of most Disney princesses, she is not Barbiefied and is very RP. And there is a fabulous and funny addition to the cast in the shape of Creeper (a character not in the books) voiced by Phil Fondacaro, one of my favourite actors. The other well crafted character is Gwrgi, the man-dog, cowardly comic relief, yes, but also the real hero. The movie plot doesn't particularly resemble the novels but is the usual Disney 'you can't make it without friends' spiel, which is fine. However, the pronounciation of the welsh names is absolutely cringeworthy - it took 12 years to make and they couldn't brush up on pronounciation?!! Taran (said - as 'tarran' but here Taah - ran)drove me nuts, plus King Eiddileg (pronounced Eith-eleg but here, Ide-il-eg(!) and don't get me started on Dallben!

There's a Black Lord who wants to get hold of a magic McGuffin that will make him all powerful, a Fellowship of Good Guys out to destroy it, an army of ghost soldiers, a bard who looks like Jimmy Stewart, a pet that looks like Mark Twain and speaks like Gollum, and some fairfolk that resemble the Rice Krispies Elves.

None of the characters are barely interesting, and though they try to be original, Disney fans get the feeling they've seen 'em times before in previous -and better- films. They're pale carbon copies in a pale carbon copy. To make things worse, the movie is completely devoid of any timing or suspense. The villain may be spooky but lacks menace, and the prerequisted sidekicks are all cutesy but not funny. An unanimated animated Disney movie!

Actually, I bought this DVD because it was mentioned in another Disney movie (""WAKING SLEEPING BEAUTY"") as the nadir of the studio's post-Walt era. So I expected it to be bad, but not THIS BAD.

946101,2,6304978286,"This particular Disney animated feature is from that period of slump between golden ages: after those classic features supervised by Walt himself, and before the present golden age, of which Beauty and the Beast was the first flower. Although a relatively pleasant and undemanding viewing experience, it is, to my way of thinking, a strong contender with The Jungle Book for  a Disney animated movie feature which bears only the barest and most coincidental resemblance to the source material it was based on - in this case, Lloyd Alexander's Prydain cycle. In this instance, names and characters are retained, and a few plot elements and situations from a cycle of five books are wrenched from their original settings and bolted hastily together in service to a standard-issue quest and finding yourself plot. The animation is pleasing in it's workmanship, there is a certain amount of mild humor, some rather scary bits involving the Horned King and his minions, and you certainly can't go wrong with an oracular pig. At the age of eight or so, my daughter loved it. However, this production has kind of going-through-the-motions-by-rote air about it; as if the producers at Disney realized that here was this wonderful best-selling bit of kid-lit out there, and they were in the business of doing animated movies based on popular kid-lit, so better get busy and crank it out because that was what everyone was expecting. There is pretty much the same perfunctory feeling about this release; a 25th Anniversary Logo on the cover, inclusion of the original theatrical trailer, a single deleted scene, a game, and a still-frame gallery.

Seriously, I wonder what Peter Jackson would have made from the Prydain books - at least three live-action movies with killer CGI effects and been packing them in by the million, I'm sure.",1289865600,5,1826,5.023102310231023

946103,3,6304978286,"To be honest, I didn't know what to expect when I popped The Black Cauldron: 25th Anniversary Edition into my DVD player. Sure, I've heard of it, but all I really knew is that it came from Disney's ""Dark Era"" (like The Great Mouse Detective), and that it takes place in a Tolkienesque world. And yes, The Black Cauldron is bold and different. This is not your average Disney fare.

The story revolves around a young boy named Taran, an assistant pig keeper who dreams of one day becoming a hero. Of course, his daydreaming usually ends up getting him into trouble, like losing his pig, Hen Wen, to the Horned King (who looks like Skeletor's more competent older brother). Why would your-paint-by the-numbers Evil Overlord want a pig? Well, it turns out this pig is magic, and can tell the future and where things are. And since the Horned King is looking for the Black Cauldron, a magical object that will give him an army of undead walking skeletons, he wants said pig. So Taran goes on an epic quest to save his pig and destroy the Black Cauldron. Along the way, he is joined by a minstrel named Fflewddur Fflam, a princess named Eilonwy (apparently the Disney Princesses line completely forgot about her, just like everyone else), and a thing named Gurgi that looks like an Ewok and talks like Donald Duck. Through the course of their journey they encounter witches, Fair Folk, and other mystical creatures. Eventually, they have to face the Horned King himself.

First off, I was really surprised to discover there was another Disney Princess I had never heard of, especially since this one is much closer in age to the Disney Princess line's target market. The next thing that stood out is how dark, violent and scary this movie is: its seems more like something up Ralph Bakshi's alley than Disney's. This may explain why it was a renowned flop; people have certain expectations for Disney films: It will have action and suspense, an exciting climax, and some patches of darkness, but the overall tone of the film is expected to be light. The Black Cauldron just isn't that kind of movie; it's still a children's movie, but it is definitely more geared for older kids.

Another problem is that darker doesn't automatically equal better. In this case, the movie has a definite lack of enjoyable characters. Taran himself is a boring, bland, selfish, unlikable character who still manages to remind me too much of Arthur/Wart from The Sword in the Stone. Most of the characters are bland; those that aren't are stereotypes; and many are both. The only character with any personality is Gurgi, and he's the comic relief!

Even when a Disney film suffers from bland heroes (I'm looking at you, Herc), a good villain can save the movie. They may be evil, but Gaston, Hades and Jafar are all have some sort of lightness to them, like you know you can't take them too seriously. The Horned King is nothing like that. He is dark, evil, quite, and just plain damn scary. In half of his scenes you can't even see his face. As a result you never feel a connection to him, and it leaves him feeling like just a clichd, humorless villain. Even Judge Frollo, who was played straight and shown to have his own weaknesses to overcome, was compelling! The Horned King, not so.

Its weak characters aside, The Black Cauldron does still manage to be exciting. I was expecting relatively mediocre animation, as in The Great Mouse Detective, but I was absolutely blown away by the visuals. The animation in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen, most notably a scene where Hen Wen is captured by dragons. The transfer on this particular DVD is brilliant, providing a nice full picture, surprisingly in CinemaScope (2.35:1 widescreen as opposed to most animated films that are 1.85:1 widescreen). The DVD also has both French and Spanish language tracks and subtitles and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Most of the special features are carried over from the previous release: ""Trick or Treat"" (an entertaining Donald Duck cartoon), ""The Quest for the Black Cauldron"" trivia game and a still frame gallery. The only new features on this disc are ""The Witches' Challenge"" game, which is essentially a rather dull Black Cauldron point-and-click riddle game, reminiscent of Dora the Explorer, and a deleted scene. For those hoping for the infamous ""man being dissolved by mist"" scene that was cut from the film for a better rating, prepare to be disappointed: the deleted scene in question here is an alternate, more boring version of when the gang meets the Fair Folk, and it's understandable why it was cut, as it would've definitely slowed the movie down. It's about ten minutes long and is told through storyboards and pencil tests. The rest of the DVD is filled out with previews for upcoming releases, and promos for DisneyFile Digital Copy and Disney Blu-ray (basically the Sprouse brothers explaining why Blu-ray is ""suite"". Their word, not mine).

It's really quite a shame. Here we are, given a decent movie with a good transfer and practically no special features. This seems to be the case more and more often, as of late. Considering the troubled production this movie had, we should've at least had a retrospective documentary or a commentary. If you're like me and care about special features, I'd wait until the inevitable Blu-ray release several years down the road, though seeing how poorly Disney treats this film, I wouldn't be surprised if we get no special features there as well.

Overall, The Black Cauldron is a decent fantasy movie, and an interesting experiment on the part of the Disney animation studio. Considering what a rarity it is--a dark Disney fantasy--it certainly deserves at least a rental, especially if you've never seen it before.",1287273600,31,5763,4.803427419354839
946174,4,6304978286,"In 1985, Walt Disney Pictures released their 25th animated feature in July 1985.  The animated film ""The Black Cauldron"" is based on the first two novels of Lloyd Alexander's ""Chronicles of Prydain"" books (a total of five novels were created from 1964-1968) and is based on Welsh mythology.

""The Black Cauldron"" is the first Disney film to utilize the APT process (a photographic transfer system that can transfer lines or solid blocks of colors onto cels) and as most new animated technology, the film was quite expensive to make.

It was also a Disney film in which it was an interesting risk for the company as the studio wanted to created a PG-rated animated film, especially since the original books that the animated film was adapted from, was quite dark.  Because the animated film was not a musical nor was it a happy, uplifting film that many young children would want to see, the film didn't perform quite well in the box office (the film was budgeted at $25 million and made $21 million).

But times have changed since the ""The Black Cauldron"" was shown in the theater and with films such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and television shows such as ""The Legend of the Seeker"" are more common place for today, there is no doubt that the storyline of ""The Black Cauldron"" will attract viewers and now ""The Black Cauldron"" will receive its DVD re-release in Sept. 2010 (the original ""The Black Cauldron - Gold Collection"" DVD was released in 2000) to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary.

VIDEO:

""The Black Cauldron"" is presented in widescreen 2:35:1 (enhanced for 169 televisions).  The first thing that came to my mind while watching this film is how beautiful the artistic backgrounds were.  There is a lot of painted with a lot of detail in the background.  From the look of the wood homes or buckets, to the lush scenery of grass and water or even the detail of the dark forest,  ""The Black Cauldron"" looks fantastic.  Walt Disney had done a fantastic job with the hand-drawn animation and overall look of the film. The last film before ""The Black Cauldron"" was the 1981 film ""The Fox and the Hound"", so it is no surprise to me that because the amount of detail we see in this film, this film took years to make.

The film looks great!  But because of the film's dark subject matter, it's unfortunate that the film was not appreciated when it was released in 1985 and it makes me wonder, because the film is not a box office earning classic, if it will ever receive Disney's wonderful HD restoration and remastering treatment in the future?

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Black Cauldron"" is presented in Dolby Digital (English, French and Spanish 5.1 surround).  The dialogue is clear and understandable and if anything, I found myself just laughing at the parts that featured Gurgi talking.  Love the sound effects that went into creating his voice.  I will say that Elmer Bernstein's music (""Twilight"", ""Cape Fear"", ""Bulletproof"") in the film is fantastic!

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Black Cauldron - 25th Anniversary"" comes with the following special features:

  * Deleted Scene--(9:50) The Fairfolk: Viewers join Taran, Fflewddur Fflam, Gurgi and Princess Eilonwy as they travel into the depths of the earth and meet the Fairfolk.  A combination of animation and the deleted animated and non-animated sketch of the various scenes.
  * Still Frame Gallery--A compilation of behind-the-scenes artwork and photos that you can view via using your remote control (or keyboard).
  * The Witches' Challenge Game--In order to defeat the dark powers of the Horned King, players must gain possession the magical sword from the Witches of Morva by solving their riddles.
  * Quest For the Black Cauldron--A trivia game in which players compete against the evil Horned King in a race to reach the Black Cauldron first.
  * Trick Or Treat-- (8:15) A classic Donald Duck Jack Hannah Halloween cartoon from 1952.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Black Cauldron"" probably didn't make sense to viewers in 1985 but 25-years-later, the story is quite tame and I personally didn't find the overall film to be too dark.  In fact, I watched it along with my seven-year-old and he just enjoyed the film and was quite engrossed while watching it.

I found the film to be quite entertaining but by saying this, I know that the film is based on Lloyd Alexander's ""The Prydain Chronicles"" and the fact there are five-volumes created, If the first two volumes were condensed to an 80-minute film, you can imagine a lot of story being lost, especially storylines that were meant to focus on character development.

So, having not read the original novels, I can imagine those who did enjoy them, may feel a bit disenchanted with the film and with Disney trying to fit everything into one film and also the film missing a lot of characters from the book and I've also read that Disney did change a few things to make it more Disney friendly.  But again, this was released in 1985 and that was how things were back then with Disney.

""The Black Cauldron - 25th Anniversary"" does add a little more content from its original 2000 ""Gold Collection"" DVD release.  You do get the new ""The Witches"" challenge game and you do get a full nine minute deleted scene as well.  And for those who are wondering, the animated short ""Trick or Treat"" starring Donald Duck and his 3 nephews is still included as well as the previous other special features as well.  It's also important to note that Disney did improve it's DVD authoring after 2003, so since the film was released originally on DVD in 2000, there is an improvement in picture quality on this 2010 DVD release.

As for parents, this is a PG film and I would not recommend this film to very young children. The Horned King is an evil nemesis and a villain that can be too frightening for children and although there are no sexual themes in the film, there are parts where you see a buxom witch and seeing the character Fflewddur Fflam getting his head stuck between them.  A scene which my wife did comment and was surprised to see (especially since we had our child watching along with us).

Overall, ""The Black Cauldron"" is a good film but I say this, having not read the original novels (so I don't share the same disappointment as those who have).  I do feel that the writers really did have a major challenge of trying to incorporate so much into an 80-minute film and the fact that the film only covers the first two novels, it's a shame that the other three novels will not be made into an animated format.  But I suppose if you go with this film's storyline on its own, despite having a dark storyline, in Disney fashion, you do have the happy ending.

I was very impressed by the artistic painted backgrounds and the animation was well-done.  But compared to other Disney animated classics, the storyline was good but not great and I refuse to call it an inferior film because it's not inferior at all. It's just that Disney has so many great films and ""The Black Cauldron"" is not one of them.  But I found the film to feature a good amount of fantasy and action and it looks fantastic.  It's definitely a Disney animated film worth watching.

The Walt Disney Company's 1985 release ""The Black Cauldron"" can be startingly mature.  A dark fantasy adapted from Lloyd Alexander's ""The Chronicles of Prydain"" book series, it features deep spiritual storylines and was given a PG rating for several very good reasons.

With the voice talents of Freddie Jones, Grant Bardsley and John Hurt(""The Elephant Man,"" ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone,"") it tells the story of Taran, an assistant pig attendant charged with keeping his clairvoyant pig out of the grasp of the demonic Horned King.  The Horned King is voiced with palpable malice by John Hurt in a genuinely edgy vocal performance that makes one wonder what Mr. Hurt would do in a live-action rendering of the same role.  The very name ""The Horned King"" can be seen as a satanic euphemism in an uncommonly direct association with evil for a Disney villain.

This movie is very certainly not for everyone, as its prevailing tone is of a downbeat nature.  However, for those who can stomach the darkness and appreciate the hard-won moral in the end, it is a very good movie.",1270252800,4,1101,4.887096774193548
946249,4,6304978286,"At the time this film was released, Disney was getting competition from other animators--remember the animated versions of 'Watership Down' and Bakshi's 'Lord of the Rings'. However, none of these were very successful at the box office. The real competition was from live action features using loads of what was then state-of-the-art special effects. Namely 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' films and their imitators.

This film is a lushly animated masterpiece that is interesting to compare with 'Watership Down' and 'Lord of the Rings' (Bakshi's film that is). It also, along with these other two films, helps set the precedent for making animated features that might appeal to boys and to older children more. These are all films many adults could watch and enjoy as well. So much later we see the results: films like 'Titan A.E.' and 'Atlantis'.

Still the Disney animators at the time tried to push too much storyline into too little animation--80 minutes just isn't enough to tell a story that could have been a very Lord-of-the-Rings-or-Star-Wars-like cycle about good ultimately overcoming all-powerful evil. The other compromise they make is trying to offset the darkness of the film with comic relief and cute characters that you would find in Disney's numerous G-rated efforts.

To conclude, this is a classic that should appeal to kids who enjoy films like 'Titan A.E.', 'Atlantis', and 'Treasure Planet' (although BC was done in the era before CGI). Parents might also consider getting copies of 'Watership Down' and 'Lord of the Rings' from around the same time, but please note none of these are suitable for young children, at least not without the most careful of pre-screening and parental supervision.",1254873600,2,1716,5.14336917562724
946250,4,6304978286,"If you get this product, please do not read the back of it.  First, the synopsis tells you the moral of the story and takes away the reason to watch it.  Second, it mentions the Black Cauldron is Disney's 25th animated classic.  This means that if it is a Disney animated film it is automatically a classic.  I find that thought an insult to my intelligence.

This departs from the previous films.  I don't mind the lack of music, but it is both creepier and darker than the other classics, and it has other scenes that I question its appropriateness (e.g. a voluptuous witch with a low cut outfit with a scene emphasizing that part of her anataomy).  I also found that the horned king, while evil, lacks the charm and personality of other Disney villains (e.g. Malificent of Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians' Cruella DeVille).

As art, it is visually stunning.  The animation is top notch.  The story is, while a bit occultish, very well put together.  In other words, it gets good technical marks.

946251,3,6304978286,"The Black Cauldron is one hour and twenty minutes long and was released in theaters on July 24, 1985. The movie at best is hard to follow along and jumps around a lot. The story begins with the introduction that claim that there was once was a ruler so evil that the only way to defeat him was to send his soul to the depth of the Black Cauldron where the Black Cauldron remained hidden for hundreds of years. The movie then switches to the scene of a small farm called Caer Dallben. Dallben is the guarding of Taran who is an Assistant Pigkeeper. Taran dreams of one day of being a great warrior and leaving the farm someday. Taran is feeding Hen Wen (a pig with special power) when Hen Wen acts ups and goes nuts Dallben orders Taran to bring Hen Wen inside. It is inside the Hen Wen powers are revealed. Hen Wen, when put under a spell, can see into the future and expose information. Dallben sees that the Horned King is after Hen Wen and orders Taran to take Hen Wen to the safe cottage on the other side of the woods. On the way to the cottage Taran loses Hen Wen and while looking for Hen Wen runs into Gurgi. Gurgi is a half human and half animal creature who is always hungry. Taran first think of Gurgi as annoying and useless and in the in Gurgi is loyal to Taran. Gurgi always call Taran master; the movie never explains why. Taran finds Hen Wen who is trying to escape from two flying dragons. Hen Wen is captured and is taken to the Horned King. Taran gives chase and finally reaches the castle of the Horned King only to be captured himself. Taran is forced to reveal to the Horned King the powers of Hen Wen. When Taran is in the middle of revealing to what the Horned King is seeking he grabs Hen Wen and tries to escape. Taran throws Hen Wen into the river before he is captured and thrown in the dungeon. In the dungeon he meets Princess Eilonwy who is an enchantress. Together they booth try to escape. In searching for the way out they discover the tomb of the king who used to own the castle and Taran takes the sword that was on top of his tomb. Taran claim it is of no use to him. Taran and Eilonwy find Fflewddur Fflam who is being held prisoner. Taran frees him and all three escape from the castle. While Eilonwy is sewing Fflewddur pants Gurgi emerges again and tells them he knows where the pig went. The trio follow Gurgi to a lake and all four a sucked below the lake where they arrive at the Isle of Mona. It is there that they find Hen Wen. The King tells them that they can find the Black Cauldron at Marshes of Morva. The people take Hen Wen back to Dallben while one of the King's assistant shows them where Morva is. At the home of the Three Witches, Taran trades his sword for the Black Cauldron and the witches tell them that the only why to defeat the Black Cauldron is that a life must willing give itself up and plunge into the Black Cauldron. With the bit of information the Three Witches leave. The four of them are by the campfire when the Horned King's warrior captures Taran, Eilonwy, and Fflewddur. Gurgi is able to avoid capture. At the castle of the Horned King, the king is able to bring his army of dead to life and sends them on a killing spree. Gurgi is able to sneak into the castle and free his friends. It is Gurgi whose sacrifice his life to destroy the Army of Dead. The Horned King returns to the Black Cauldron and tries to sacrifice Taran so he can bring his army back to life. Taran is able to defeat the Horned King and the Horned King dies at the mercy of the Black Cauldron. The trio makes their escape from the castle before it is destroyed. Once on land the Three Witches make their appearance again and try to reclaim the Black Cauldron. Fflewddur intervenes (the first time in the movie he has shown courage) and demands a trade for the Black Cauldron. At first they give the sword back but Taran realizes he is not a warrior but an Assistant Pig Keeper turns down the offer. In the end he bargains for the life of Gurgi. The Three Witches accept the bargain and bring Gurgi back to life and they get the Black Cauldron. In the end the four are head back to Caer Dallben. I had a very hard time trying to follow the movie. Also this movie was a first that this was not musical movie. In the past there would have been a least song, spoken or instrumental, is a Disney movie. Also not since Alice In Wonderland where there screen credits at the end of the movie. The Black Cauldron was a bust at the box office, but did manage to have a cult following in later years. The Black Cauldron gets a C-.

946316,3,6304978286,"EDIT: Although Disney has yet to announce a release date, The Black Cauldron WILL be reissued in a new Special Edition DVD. Hopefully this will include a restored transfer and some new bonuses. Already advertised have been a new game as well as deleted scenes. Whether these are the infamous deleted scenes of completed animation or not remains to be seen. This is why Disney has discontinued this inferior DVD.

I'm not going to go into detail about the movie, its plot, its troubled history, etc. You can find that just about anywhere you look online for this film. I'm strictly going to discuss the DVD. This DVD has several pros and cons that you might consider before buying.

Pros:
-The movie is presented in its original 70MM widescreen aspect ratio for the first time since its original theatrical release.
-The DVD contains an incredible Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track.
-Although not listed ANYWHERE on the packaging, the original theatrical trailer is included, very scratchy and in fullscreen
-The Quest For The Black Cauldron Game is quite a bit of fun. Not as fun as other Disney DVD set-top games, but better than your average trivia DVD game.
-A great still-frame gallery is included - our only glimpse into the making of the movie.
-The DVD includes the great Donald Duck cartoon Trick Or Treat.

Cons:
-The film is presented in a 4:3 letterboxed transfer instead of a 16:9 letterboxed transfer.
-The film obviously hasn't been given any type of restoration, cleanup, or anything of that matter. Dirt, scratches, and flickering, while not a complete nuisance, are more present than one would like.
-Apart from the photo gallery, there is NOTHING on here that gives the consumer any insight into the making of the film.
-Although the theatrical trailer is present, it would have been nice had Disney also included some TV spots and the trailer from the 1985 VHS release of Pinocchio, which is said to contain some of the deleted footage from the film.
-Speaking of the deleted footage, if not restored into the film itself, they could have at least included it as a bonus feature, with some info on why it was deleted and such. Preferably shown edited into where it'd be in the film so as to be placed into context.
-I'm not sure if this is an issue with everyone, but on my RCA DVD player, when chapter 12 ends, instead of simply going into chapter 13, it skips to chapter 14 and I have to skip back to chapter 13 in order to watch it. I wouldn't bother mentioning this, except I returned my first copy in exchange for a new one, and the new one did the same thing. It's a shame that Disney cares so little for this movie that they allowed mass quantities of the DVD to go out with a glitch like this and instead of recalling them and fixing the problem, they just let them be sold. While at least I won't MISS any of the movie, it still ruins the flow of the film to have to rewind to view the skipped chapter. Hopefully, this isn't a problem for most DVD players.

Considering that Disney is starting to reissue some of its Gold Classic Collection discs with new transfers, new bonus materials, etc., hopefully they'll give The Black Cauldron the same consideration. A new transfer shouldn't be difficult, since the film HAS been restored and made into an anamorphic widescreen transfer. (This version has currently only seen the light of day in France.) Despite the fact that The Black Cauldron was one of Disney's most troubled and financially disappointing productions in the history of the studio, it's since developed a loyal, if small, following, and a new DVD release with some additional trailers/TV ads, SOME kind of making-of material, a freshened up 16:9 enhanced widescreen transfer, and all that good stuff (Maybe even a music-only track to show off Elmer Bernstein's magnificent score.) would be a nice way to acknowledge that yes, there ARE people out there who would actually LIKE a better DVD of this film. Meanwhile, I'm not holding my breath for it anytime soon, so for now, I'll make do with this Gold Collection Edition DVD with its passable transfer, all the while being grateful that they at least bothered to present it in its original widescreen format. I guess I'll give kudos to Disney at least for that...and for the fact that it's seen the light of day on any home video format at all in the US.",1204070400,9,4344,4.674509803921569

946393,4,6304978286,"THE BLACK CAULDRON has continually been dismissed by Disney enthusiasts and moviegoers since it was originally released in 1985.  It was definitely one of the more ambitious animated projects undertaken by the studio.  Ten years in the making, it was also the most expensive project since 1940's ""Pinocchio"" and the first 70mm widescreen movie since ""Sleeping Beauty"" in 1959.  In THE BLACK CAULDRON, Disney attempted to cram Lloyd Alexander's densely-written ""Prydain Chronicles"" books into one movie, and the result was hardly a hit, but it's not a flop, either.

Taran (voiced by Grant Bardsley) is a dreamer, looking to find his place in the adventurous world beyond the cottage of his master, Dallben (Freddie Jones).  Taran spends his days tending to a mystical clairvoyant pig called Hen Wen.  The life of Hen Wen hangs in the balance when the evil Horned King (John Hurt) decides to use her powers to find the location of the Black Cauldron, where all the evil forces of the world are kept.  Hen Wen is spirited away to the Horned King's castle with Taran in hot pursuit.  Once at the castle, Taran teams with young Princess Eilonwy (Susan Sheridan), eccentric musician Fflewddur (Nigel Hawthorne), and a cute little furry creature called Gurgi (John Byner).  Their only hope lies in finding the Black Cauldron before it's evil powers fall into the wrong hands...

This is not your usual Disney fare.  It's very dark, there are no musical numbers, no real ""happily ever after"" ending, and the overall tone of the piece does not sit well with the previous Disney animated movies.  I believe the animators were trying to capture a feeling and mood that had been earlier established in other animated films of the period (Don Bluth's ""The Secret of NIMH"" and Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"" immediately spring to mind).  Elmer Bernstein's music perfectly underscores every mood.

THE BLACK CAULDRON is a thrilling medieval adventure, and will appeal to those with a taste for that.  Disney purists are sadly always going to have a problem with it, but hopefully it will be appreciated for what it is.

The DVD includes a set-top game called ""Quest for the Black Cauldron""; the vintage Donald Duck cartoon ""Trick or Treat""; still galleries, and the trailer.",1175558400,5,2264,4.949735449735449
946394,3,6304978286,"I'm a big fan of Disney movies and when I heard this one was for sale, I had to see it - the rumors of the forgotten/hidden/canned Disney film, maybe because of that infamous PG rating, were far too tempting.  It turns out, there are some scary images (the Horned King is not exactly the prettiest burning eyed skull you've ever seen), but that's cool.  Now I understand the rating.  But the story line leaves a lot to be desired.  I can't say how close the movie followed the books by Lloyd Alexander (despite being an avid reader as a kid, I somehow missed this series), but as a film, there didn't seem to be a good reason for any of the characters' actions.  The first scene was pretty dull and from there it just got weird. You never really get a good sense of the world around the characters (it's like extras were at a premium, and yes, it's animated).  When the princess appeared pretty much out of nowhere, I found her moderately annoying and pointless.  Our hero, Taran, had so many wacky sidekicks that none of them really had the chance to be developed.  And the ending is strangely unsatisfying.

Pros: the pig is really cute.  Cons: everything else.  I would recommend The Sword in the Stone over this one for a tale of a boy and his sword, but if you really want to see it, borrow it or rent it.  It's probably not one you'll want to keep.",1173312000,2,1354,4.329365079365079

They changed some of the events a bit which didn't make sense to me and the movie seemed rushed, especially when it came to finding the black cauldron. I think this film would of done better as a live action movie, such as Disney's sucsessful ""Narnia"".

Unfortunately, there are a couple specific shortcomings from this release's promises which makes me sad that I bought it:

1. The artwork listed here (and in other promotional material) implies it was released with a slip-case like other 'gold/platinum' collection releases. In fact, it's a simple keep-case.

2. The back cover implies it is shown in original theatrical wide-screen format. Unfortunately, this is true only if you are viewing it on an old standard-aspect TV. It is in fact matted to appear widescreen, but both on a widescreen TV and on my computer, the matting is part of the picture, meaning you essentially can't view it in widescreen 'mode'. Very frustrating and makes for a horrible viewing experience.

Considering that it was a bomb at the theatre, you'd think Disney would have invested in at least marketing this to completists who want a high-quality collectible, even if it wasn't their favorite movie. I hope eventually they get around to doing so. This is not the release to buy if that's what you're looking for.",1167609600,5,1259,4.869158878504673
946398,5,6304978286,"This is probably the darkest (literally) Disney cartoon made, even eclipsing Snow White for dismal castle scenes and skeletons. My daughter, then 7, simply didn't go for it and found it 'far too scary' towards the end - the Barbie and Cinderella films are more her bag. My son at the same age loved it however, and I quite enjoyed watching it with him as well. The story involves a young boy farmer (who has dreams of being a great warrior) and his magic pig, who both search for the mystical Black Cauldron. The scene with the three witches who guard the Black Cauldron is a highlight in a pretty consistent film (once the story gets going). OK, some of the characters, well one really, the Bard, are a bit wet, and occasionally the slapstick seems out of place, but the cosmic struggle between good (the farm-boy Taran) and evil (the Horned King) is well done and there a few nice touches. Personally I prefer the older 'Sword in the stone' though which has a similar feel, as it's also a medieval fantasy, although that one's relatively pig free. However do have a look at the excellent book this film was adapted from: The Black Cauldron (Chronicles of Prydain) by Lloyd Alexander, aimed squarely at preteen boys around 10 - it's part of a cult series of books first published in the 1960s.

This film is strangely reminiscent of the earlier 1982 film - Conan the Barbarian, partcularly the tomb sequence where Taran finds the enchanted sword. Although this film is a little scary for little ones, the humour lightens the film considerably and it's no more frightening than Sheer Khan's sequences in The Jungle Book really. Overall I think many preteen children (more likely a boy I suspect) would enjoy watching 'The Black Cauldron' few times (but it's not for frequent viewing). It's probably not for teenager's either, who will no doubt prefer the likes of the new 'King Kong', `Batman Begins' and Harry Potter.",1166832000,,1918,4.708333333333333

It is not as good as the book but it is a movie in its own right. One of my biggest complaints about the book to movie translation, and Im sure others agree, is that the character Gwydoin is missing. The one thing that could have been better was Tarans character. He is kinda weak and clumsey but I guess any wannabe hero is to a certain degree. The Bard and Gurgi add humour to this movie(and the book as well)

This is a good movie that any disney movie fan should own",1159056000,3,738,3.972972972972973
946421,3,6304978286,"Plot in a nutshell: Taran is an assistant pig keeper for the old wizard Dallben in the land of Prydain who dreams of being a great heroic leader of men. Then trouble starts brewing when the Evil Horned King embarks on a dark quest to unleash the power of the Black Cauldron and attempts to kidnap Taran's pig Hen Wen, who happens to be an Oracular Pig. When Taran is given the task of taking the pig to safety, he loses her to the Horned King's forces and must embark on a quest to reclaim her, which introduces him to the hyper-talkative Princess Eilonwy, the slightly untruthful bard Flewder Flam, and the goofy little man-dog creature Gurgi, and then they in turn must embark on a quest to find the Black Cauldron itself and destroy it somehow.

Well meaning if unsuccessful adaptation of the first two books in Lloyd Alexander's ""The Chronicles of Prydain"" book series, combining the plots of the first two books, #1 ""The Book of 3"" and #2 ""The Black Cauldron"", with the second book's plot taking center stage primarily. Many important characters from the books such as Prince Gwydion, Coll, Adaon, Morgant, and Elydir among others were lost in the translation from book to film. It's not un-entertaining, just uneven.

946422,5,6304978286,"This is truely an awesome...perhaps mostly forgotten movie! it's too bad that they don't show this movie more often on the Disney channel, you know I look at this WONDERFUL movie and look at what the Disney Company has created these days, and not to say that they aren't good...but I look at the Black Cauldron and compare it to today's movies and I can't help but wonder if it is truely the same people creating these newer movies that created The Black Cauldron...They just don't make movies like they used to, everything in today's newer movies are all updated with newer music and stuff that doesn't even belong in the movies,look at Cinderella II for instance, I feel like they just totally ruined Cinderella, and you know they just make it totally lame! what happened to the themes like what The Sword and the Stone or The Black Cauldron have... sure, they have happy endings, but from watching most of the movie, you can't help but wonder if alls going to be well in the end! the evil horned king dude is no dummy! he sits back and let's Taran, the assistant pig keeper boy, find the Cauldron for him, along with his pals adorable Gurgi, The Wonderful Princess Eilonwy, and Kind hearted Fluta. Together they find the Black Cauldron, but sacrifices must be made, Taran gives up the enchanted sword he picked up in the burrial chamber of the horned kings castle, with this sword, Tarans dreams would come true, it is a great sacrifice, and sure enough the Horned King finds them and takes them captive, all but the wity minded, sweet Gurgi who runs off just in the nick of time...Smart...very smart! since he ran off, he was able to save his friends that had all but given up hope to stop the horned king until he came along...there are many heros in this movie, but I think Gurgi is the biggest hero, he sacrifices himself to the black cauldron instead of Taran...even though Gurgi doesn't get the girl at the end, he is still the hero at the end, and don't get me wrong, I can't find one reason do dis on this movie... but I don't think the princess is Gurgi's type. yeah, like I said before, they just don't make them like they used to, they were far more better then then they are now!

Charector Rating in my opinion

Taran-9/10 he is a good hearted boy, but at times he is a self-rightious kid, but he never lets his friends down. awesome charector.

Gurgi-10/10 Gurgi is a sweet little hairy dude who truely has a heart of gold, no matter what he gets his way, wrather he chomps on an apple or jumps on Fluta to get his hat...funny little thief.

Princess Eilonwy 10/10 She's a wonderful girl, whom you could say saves Taran, who would have probably remained in the dungeon for a while... a long while, she has a heart of Gold as well, but, when you piss her off, watch out she's a fiesty little thing! but she remains loyal to her friends throughout the movie, she's a sweet heart.

Fluta-10/10 This movie just wouldn't be the same without Fluta, he is totally awesome! I just get a kick out of him and the witch sister, she is like totally in love with Fluta and he realizes it, he doesn't care for the situation, it's quite humorous.

The Horned king-10/10 He is what I would imagine from the dark medevil ages, he's got the looks, the castle, the attitude, the warrior dudes, man, he is ruthless! totally medevilness! he pisses me off bad in this movie at one point, he calls the wonderful princess a scullery maid....THAT'S NOT NICE! WHAT IS UP WITH THAT! that doesn't even come close to describing her! jerk! yeah, so like the princess alot, I think she is beautiliciously cute! I admit it!

most everyone's a tree-hugger nowadays! how does it go now... oh my child is gonna have nightmares about the horned king, oh, you mean there is killing and skeloten dudes that kill people, oh my god, my child is gonna watch this movie and turn to the bad side ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh nnnnnnnnooooooooooooo, good grief how paranoid can one tree-hugger get they usually ruin everything for everyone! I think watching this stuff and seeing the results helps them stay away from turning bad. So this movie doesn't exactly go along with the book, movies don't usually do that you know, but that is no reason to dis on this movie. you know what happens in the books, don't expect everything to be in the movie, remember it is BASED on the books, it doesn't say animated book, things have to be different in the movie, that's just the way it is! I haven't read the book yet, but usually movie's do a good job at scimming parts of the books to where you realize that's the part where this happens in the book. This is my VERY FAVORITE movie of Walt Disney's, the charectors are excellent, the princess is beautiful, the bad guys look like bad guys, the good guys look like good guys, the story is awesome, things go extraordinarily bad, then it all turns great, things just all slide together excellently, it's not your everyday, extraordinarily boring, happily ever after movie, it is one of those movie's that is great for the entire family... (if your not a tree-hugger) it is one of those movies that keeps you at the edge of your seat wondering, what's gonna happen next? is he gonna die? are they gonna win? what happen's to him? it's a wonderfully great movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a great family movie that is sick and tired of the corney everything is too perfect sort of movie! we are poisoned by the newer fairytale movies, the things that happen in those movies are too good to be true, don't listen to them, you will be scared for life! soon you will think that everything in your everyday life is supposed to go like that for you, and it won't. all throughout this movie I give it a strong 10/10 there is no weak spots in it for me! give it a try, you won't be sorry!",1153353600,3,5822,4.466165413533835

I hope someone who knows what they are doing will make a movie worthy of the book.  I almost wrote Disney and demanded my money back for this god awful DVD. If I was Disney I would put this movie back in the vault and leave it there. In fact they should destroy all of the copies and try to erase it from their history.,1137369600,2,461,4.054945054945055

946425,5,6304978286,"I only recently watched this movie for the first time and found it to be a wonderful tale, although a different departure for Disney. I have read the books, The Chronicles of Prydain, and count them as being one of the best fantasy series' ever written. This movie is called The Black Cauldron but is really a combination of that book and The Book of Three. However I'm not going to sit here and compare the movie to the books. That would be a travesty.

To begin, the animation of this film is simpley breathtaking. This was the most expensive animated film of its era and it is definitely noticeable. The juxtaposition of color and darkness bring an eerie feeling of happiness mixed with foreboding and dread.

Also, the Horned King is one of the greatest Disney villians of all time and definitely one of the more memorable. Although it is true that we should see more of him to get a sense of who he is, he is one scary dude. I wouldn't want to venture into his castle either, thank you very much.

Taran as a hero is mediocre at best. However the heart of the film lies with Gurgi as a faithful friend who riskes it all for his buddies and ""crunchings and munchings."" Flewdurr Flam is a good character as well. Princess Eilonwy is somewhat forgettable.

I feel that this film should deserve more credit than it has received, although parents should be cautious before letting their young children view it. I'm hoping a new generation of Disney lovers will rediscover this lost gem.",1131321600,8,1486,4.5335820895522385

946469,5,6304978286,"Of all of Disney's animated classics, 'The Black Cauldron' was one of the last that I saw, not counting the package features and some of Disney's latest releases which I have no interest in seeing whatsoever.  I didn't have any clue of what The Black Cauldron was about, I had seen a few pictures of it and heard very little about it, at one point, I even thought this film was some kind of Mickey Mouse short.  Well, I finally got to watch ""The Black Cauldron"" and after repeated viewings, I don't know why I waited so long to see it, it is truly amazing and one of Disney's greatest adventure tales.

Inspired by the first two titles in The Chronicles of Prydain, 'The Black Cauldron' is the story of assistant pig-keeper Taran, a careless young boy who dreams of one day becoming Prydain's finest warriors.  His chance comes when his master, Dallben discovers that the terrifying Horned King has discovered the powers of one of the pigs the boy takes care of.  You see, Hen Wen the pig can create visions of what's to come and Dallben fears the Horned King will want to use Hen Wen's power for evil.  For this, Dallben sends unprotected Taran alone with Hen Wen and asks him to take care of the pig and hide until its safe.  However, Hen Wen runs away and Taran's adventure begins, meeting such memorable characters as the wild, furry Gurgi, the sweet, sassy Princess Eilonwy and the fun minstrel, Fflewddur Fflam.  Taran and his friends begin a fantastic and magical journey through the lands of Prydain, learning more about the Horned King and his evil intentions, now they must race against him to find the wicked Black Cauldron and destroy it, before the evil King gets his hands on it.

This beautiful film offers just about everything that makes a great Disney film, the best of Disney animation and a delightful cast of characters is brought to life with great vocal acting.  Comic relief is brought by such fun characters as Fflewddur Fflam, Gurgi, Creeper and Doli, the grumpy fairy.  The film doesn't have any real songs, but that is made up with a breathtaking soundtrack, very complete and probably knocking out other musicals like even ""The Lion King.""  'The Black Cauldron' is very different from other classic Disney animated features, for one, it doesn't feature a complete happy ending, for Taran never really sees his dream come true, the film ends more realistically having Taran learn that everyone must be happy with whom they are, but you also know that after this adventure, good Taran has gotten yet one big step closer.

After reading several reviews, I've seen many people call this the worst of Disney features or a simply forgettable feature.  However, just by comparing it to trashy newer films like ""Home on the Range"" or ""Atlantis - The Lost Empire"" you know ""The Black Cauldron"" is high, high above such films.  'The Black Cauldron' has been poorly released to DVD under the Gold Classic Collection line, which automatically states that the DVD brings little bonus features, which although few, are pretty decent.  What I mind most is such a poor presentation of the film, a restoration such as the ones given to older Disney flicks is definitely needed here, for the film is presented, flashy, shaky and not very sharp.  However, the DVD is still highly recommended and so is the movie.  If you haven't read Lloyd Alexander's books, I recommend watching this before reading the books so you can avoid disappointments, since as others have stated, the film isn't the finest re-telling of the chronicles.",1119225600,6,3538,4.753267973856209
946470,1,6304978286,"I watched this film through my fingers, too upset and horrified by what I was seeing to take in the whole view. How could the wonderful, humorous, epic Lloyd Alexander books be reduced to this? Why couldn't a respectable movie studio have picked up the license, and made a worthy film with talented actors? The entire spectacle just made me sick.

The very least Disney could have done would be to make a five-part series that covered all the books, but no. This is the only film there is, and it's not even based on The Black Cauldron. It's a muddled mix of that book (which was the second in the series) and The Book of Three (the first in the series). Blech.

And then--I can barely type this--Gwydion (forgive me if I mispelled it...) isn't in it. At all. He's one of the best characters in the entire series, and he doesn't even get a supporting role!? And that's only the beginning of the heinous omissions. There's nothing about the race to find the Cauldron, the sad trading of the magical brooch, or Taran's swallowing his pride for the good of Prydain, and that's only mentioning a few. Instead, we have some half-baked trash where Taran slashes through hoards with the magic sword Dyrnwyn for a while (when in reality he can't even draw it until he's earned the right), then giving it to the witches so he can destroy the Cauldron. Then Gurgi jumps in the cauldron at the end, but is somehow brought back. By this time, I was trying to find a way to retch and watch the movie simultaneously.

In all, this might be a decent movie to keep the kiddies occupied while you get the housework done, but why? Read them the books instead. Don't waste time and money on pointless trash.",1117324800,11,1688,4.474025974025974
946471,4,6304978286,"In 1985, Disney attempted to do a PG-rated swords-and-sorcery animated tale based on a good source material--Lloyd Alexander's CHRONICLES OF PRYDAIN.  The resulting movie had a lot of winning things going for it--for one, the animation was impressive for its time, showcasing an early mixture of CG effects.  A massive underscore by Elmer Bernstein (which remains one of the best for a Disney movie) substitutes singing characters here.  In addtion, there are at least some well-defined (and created) characters, notably the young, inexperienced ""pig-boy"" Taran, the terrifying Horned King (voiced superbly by John Hurt) and of course the two ""comic"" characters, Gurgi (a Gollum-like character with a childlike innocence and more loyalty--and an equally cuddly voice) and Creeper (a great baddie sidekick for a villain).

And yet the movie is considered Disney's greatest failure. It is understandable to see why: for one, the movie flopped at the box office (in fact, it took more than 10 years after its theatrical debut to finally arrive on home video). Second, in trying to compress the five-volume ""Chronicles of Prydain"" into one movie, the story comes across as a little too overplotted and frustratingly leaves questions one is likely to have about its characters (and magic rules) unanswered. The third reason is that aside from the aforementioned quartet of Taran, the Horned King, Gurgi, and Creeper, the characters aren't as well defined or memorable as they could be. In particular, Princess Eilonwy (whose bitchiness from the novels has been noticeably toned down for the film) comes across as an underdeveloped heroine--her abrupt shift from berating Taran's boasting about who got them out of trouble to a quasi-romantic love interest felt jarring to me. The same, frustratingly, feels true for many of the other characters, even if some of them (Fflewdurr Flamm, an elderly minstrel whose harpstrings happen to snap every time he lies) are actually quite likeable and/or interesting (a trio of batty witches who hold the titular object).

But even with its flaws, THE BLACK CAULDRON is by no means Disney's worst animated feature (that prestigious title belongs to HERCULES and probably HOME ON THE RANGE). True, it is problematic, but I nonetheless enjoyed the movie and applaud the animators for painting a grim, gothic fantasy setting through art. If only the plotting and characters were better developed, it would've been a classic. I would definitely recommend reading the books to get a full experience on the universe Disney was struggling to portray but by all means try out the movie as well. It has a lot of high points and there are some great animation effects (notably when an army of skeleton warriors comes alive), even though it probably isn't one of Disney's best.

A word of caution to parents: this is probably not a good film for children to watch. THE BLACK CAULDRON was clearly rated PG for a reason--not anything in the way of graphic violence or profanity, but there are lots of scenes which do come across as nightmarish, especially those involving the Horned King.

As far as the DVD release goes, it's a bit sparse on the extras, but the slide-show feature on its production origins and spin-offs warrants the purchase alone. The visual transfer is well done (aside from a few film scratches and one period of dirt filter) and it sure beats watching a pan-and-scan version. The real star of the DVD, though is the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound mix. THE BLACK CAULDRON was originally mixed for six-track Dolby Surround, and the music by Elmer Bernstein comes across as brilliant and the dialogue separation is impeccable.

So there you have it, my impressions of this flawed yet grossly undervalued entry to the Disney animation cannon. True, it's far from perfect, but as long as you don't compare it to the books (and acknowledge that it was created at a time when the studio was in something of a slump), THE BLACK CAULDRON is enjoyable and leaps and bounds above the weakest animated films ever made.",1113523200,15,4042,5.022388059701493
946472,2,6304978286,"I work in animation and I have been scouring the video stores lately in search of anything that I may have missed earlier my entertainment is also my research. I picked this up, remembering that there had been great hype about it at one time, and having heard that the books were very good. My significant sweetie always refers to them whenever we discuss mythic structure for storytelling, she thinks they are a prime example.

Well I was disappointed. The drawings are good, the characters seem to have potential, but the quality just isn't there. The movie particularly falls short on settings. The backgrounds seem to have all been done cheaply and so do most of character sequences. The story is bland, and my sweetie frequently pointed out how the characters and major plot turns had been thinned or rushed in order to fit the story into the duration of the movie.

I wondered why, when I picked up the box and read that it had been a Disney movie they had not promoted it as they consistently do with their other old films. For instance I recently saw a poster with several princesses from Disney movies, Jasmine, Belle, Cinderella, Snow White, but Princess Eilonwy, from this movie is not in it. Well after having watched it, it seems apparent that they want to distance themselves from it. Rightly so.

If all you want to do is sit your child down for an hour and a half to keep them quiet then this will probably fill the void as well as anything. In much the same way children will often take Kool Aid as readily as grape juice. But if you want to give them quality then I Suggest you keep looking.

946473,1,6304978286,"Sorry, I hate to offend those of you who are 12 or under, but this movie is a piece of ridiculous plagiarism.  It's a very bad, formulaic movie based on the classic Disney principles: see something good, make a movie, slap the title of the good thing on the movie and make the characters have vaguely the same dialogue in the movie as in the book/other movie/classic fairytale.  Those of you who are already fellow admirers of Lloyd Alexander's five-part series will note that the movie takes the name of the second book.  I suppose it was the easiest to rip off.  For some reason the plot is centered on the black cauldron, which issue was brought up AND RESOLVED in only one of FIVE books.  Gurgi is about the size of a terrier, while The Book of Three clearly describes him as about five feet tall.  Gurgi plays out taking Taran's apple, but neglects choking him from behind first.  Taran somehow comes upon that magic sword (the name of which I forget; it's been years since I've had access to the books) out of nowhere and doesn't try to get rid of it.  The cauldron warriors appear in droves out of nowhere, rather than requiring actual people to go into the cauldron to become the deathless, soulless killing machines of the series.  In case you haven't noticed, I'm describing something close to a Final Fantasy sequel, with Gurgi representing the Moogles.  For those of you unfamiliar with the Final Fantasy series, that means the two things are almost wholly unrelated.  Disney's production team of hacks wrote up their own sub-par script, drew up silly and ridiculous approximations of the original characters, and slapped a random book name on the whole thing.  By adding occasional ""authentic settings"" (the quotes indicate sarcasm, rather than an actual quotation) in random places, like for instance the scene from the end of the third book, The Castle of Llyr, at the end of the movie, Disney somehow hoped to make this movie stand apart from the millions of dollars' worth of useless trash they churn out every year.  They did not succeed.  This movie is plagiarized crap and deserves to have every VHS, DVD, video CD, or hard drive carrying even the slightest scene from it in anything other than a tone of ridicule and disgust burnt.

946474,4,6304978286,"Based on ""The Black Cauldron"" by Lloyd Alexander, Disney's first PGrated film starts out well but loses steam about halfway through, when the action becomes bogged down and we lose interest in the characters. This is the story of taran, a pig keeper who is charged with keeping a clairvoyant pig safe from an evil-doer. Along the way taran meets friends and enemies, and learns more about life. The animation is interesting but the content is darker, and the film doesn't really do justice to a fine novel. This will be of interest if you like the book or want to see every Disney film, but it isn't particularly appropriate for young children or for those with a more casual interest.

A mixture of visual styles are used in the film, hand-drawn animation, CGI (Disney's first attempt) and even live action smoke.  This mixture gives the film a very distinctive look.  One that is strikingly different from other Disney animated films.
The Horned King is Disney's most terrifying looking villain ever but he's got the personality of a dead fish.  We never connect or understand him like we did say Lady Tremaine or Maleficent.  When one character sacrifices himself for the good of the others it should be an act filled with great drama and emotion but it didn't even choke me up much less bring a tear to my eye.
What the film really needs is character development and a clearly thought out plot.  About a third of the way through we learn that the film is not about what we were lead to believe (the thwarting of evil) but Tarran's need to accept his position in life.  This is a drastic change and the film never really recovers it's footing afterwards.

The animation is too different and it detatches itself from the other Disney films.  The villain is too strong and powerful for a child audience and a little too mediocre for an older crowd.

The first book, The Book of Three, introduces all these characters as they unite to find Hen Wen and keep her from the Horned King. The Disney producers seems to have slammed these first two books together with little regard for Alexander's work except its popularity.
Though in the books, these characters are complex, funny, and interesting, I found myself yawning five minutes into this film, because the screenplay strips away character in an attempt to graft in gags and evil castles. In the Book of Three, Taran's sword is taken away by the Princess, a sorcesses, because he hasn't the right to use it. Here, Taran is forced to become a swashbuckler instantly, without any development whatsoever. That was the point of the four books, to develop Taran into the character he becomes.
I remember when this film came out, it tanked, hammering one more nail in the Disney coffin until the new regime came in and revived the animated feature.  It's hard to believe that the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast come only a few years after this clunking, over-serious, archaic feature.
That said, the artwork - the backgrounds mainly - is detail and often superb.  It's too bad that who ever transfered this over to DVD didn't care to clean up the negative. When this film shines, it can really shine. Also, don't watch TBC along with the Peter Jackson Fellowship of the Ring; too many shots are similar for comfort.

Like the Rankin-Bass Return of the King, crucial motivations and important relationships are poorly established or not explained at all, long journeys are reduced to a two-second transition shot, and the exposition manages to be both half-hearted and desperate.  Unlike The Return of the King, the bad comic relief is rampant.  Several characters seem to have been rewritten entirely as tiresome jokes (can the minstrel really have been that useless and goofy?  Could the witches have been such feeble caricatures?)
In a movie in which nearly everything is handled poorly,  the villain fares perhaps worst of all, because he has such tremendous potential.  A death's-headed sorcerer who uses the eponymous cauldron to raise an army of the undead, he ought to be monstrous and terrifying.  And while he looks nasty enough, and delivers a lot of speeches about ""the cauldron-born"" that in theory should send chills down the spines of small children, he seems to inspire little fear in the inhabitants of the movie.  They all talk about his dread majesty, of course, but scene after scene shows him striding into a room full of boisterous henchmen who, far from being in awe of their evil master,  barely seem to notice him at all, and do not even stop eating when he speaks.  His second-in-command or Generic Comic Sidekick is terrified of him, but only because he is constantly bashing him over the head.  Even the hero, an untested young boy, barely balks in his presence.  The man has no menace about him.  He might as well settle down and start reading romance novels, because he's exactly as scary as the Elephant Man. He probably needs an army of the undead just to maintain order in the Castle of Evil.
 Also abominable is the film's treatment of Gurgi, the fluffy nothing who begins as odious comic relief and stays odious comic relief until precisely the moment he is needed for a heroic self-sacrifice.  It turns out that for obscure EVIL reasons of its own, the Cauldron (which has to be destroyed so that the dead can stop walking and the Horned King can get back to whatever it is he does when not covering all the lands in darkness) needs someone's life given willingly.  Gurgi, a useless bit of window dressing not unlike that annoying hummingbird in Pocahontas (only with the added inconvenience of speech) has been rejected by the heroes of the movie as cumbersome and silly and for contributing absolutely nothing to the plot.  So he's feeling a little sad and lonely, and so just when you think that one of the heroes is going to sacrifice himself to the Cauldron for the salvation of the world, the little Ewok comes panting out in front of everybody, announces, ""Gurgi has no friends.  Gurgi will die,"" or some such thing, and cannonballs into the Cauldron, just like that-- thus granting cinema perhaps the least thoughtful suicide in its history.  Well, all right.  But if you thought just because The Black Cauldron was rated PG that it would let its odious comic relief stay dead, think again.  No sooner has the undead army been swirled back into the earth than Gurgi is found, coughing and wheezing but very much alive.  What, did the Cauldron have pity on him or something?  Pretty sentimental for an EVIL artifact, especially considering that nobody else really liked Gurgi to begin with.  The entire sequence-- the seeming arbitrariness of Gurgi's sacrifice and his subsequent (and equally arbitrary) resurrection, would have sunk a much better movie.  Here, it's just one more in a long string of bad decisions.
 The overall failure of the movie, however, is a consistent and difficult to explain failure of tone.  Technically, all the elements are there for a competent Disney movie-- except that the adventure isn't exciting, the humor isn't funny, the heroes are colorless and seem to act almost at random, and the villain is peculiarly unimpressive.  In fact, the entire movie appears to have been written, directed, and edited by an early experiment in artificial intelligence.  The computer was given a few books and the Disney formula and instructed to make a hit movie.  The result is a novelty, but not a success.  The Black Cauldron is soulless.",1074038400,25,4380,4.862533692722372

But don't let that deter you from getting this movie and showing it to just about any age group.  Although =some= younger children might get upset about the sheer evil of the ""Horned King"" and his army, he is still one of the best Disney villains ever.
The basic plot is simple.  Taran, an assistant pig keeper, finally realizes that the pig he is keeping watch over is a magical animal, capable of foretelling the future.  He, along with a few friends, must protect this pig.  The evil wizard captures the pig and finds out the location of the Black Cauldron, a very powerful magical device capable of summoning an army of undead warriors.  Taran and his friends must somehow prevent the wizard from coming to the full fruition of his plans.
My favorite character was Fflewddur Fflam, the travelling minstrel that is drawn into this quest of Taran's.  Every time he tells a lie, a string breaks on his magical instrument.  This funny bit reappears several times during the movie, and it is wonderful to see him change what he is going to say in mid-sentence in order to keep his strings from breaking.
Strangely, this movie is based on the =second= book in Lloyd Alexander's ""Chronicles of Prydain"".  I would have liked it much more had they done the other books in the series, but the fantastic bomb this was in the theaters probably prevented that.

Viewers who are familiar with the Prydain Chronicles and are militant about the rendering of a written story to film will probably react otherwise.  The movie is more of a parrallel of the entire Prydain series than the second book in the series, the eponymous Black Cauldron, with characters and events appearing anachronistically.

I was very disappointed by The Sword in the Stone, mosly because many of the sequences not essetial to the telling of the story was too long and tiring for my taste.

The picture and especially colors on this transfer to DVD are top notch. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because (if your very picky about your total picture quality) you can BARLEY notice (only if you look very close) the film element transfer with a very slight grain flicker. I am very picky about my DVD quality and I would suggest anybody that is a fan of the film to go ahead and buy it and overlook this very slight problem because you have to look very close to notice it. Otherwise I will say this is the best yet transfer to DVD that Disney has done. The colors are brillant and picture perfect in every way. SOUND QUALITY - TOP NOTCH!

The animation and artistry were superb, particularly anything having to do with the Horned King's Castle! The animators really managed to capture the dark, wicked, Gothic element that most ""evil"" lands of fantasy have. Hats off to you guys! The plot jumps along a bit fast, but this isn't so much of a problem, particularly if you're like me and want to get straight into the quest. My only real concern is that this film -- being a Disney one and all -- tends to have several ""mature"" scenes and that Horned King is really scary...a little too scary, I guess, because the movie was slapped with a  PG rating (unheard of for a Disney cartoon!)

After all, I saw this movie when I was a child and have fond memories of it - and that came BEFORE I took it upon myself to read the novels. Needless to say, my opinion was altered, for ""The Black Cauldron"" is not at all like the book from which it draws its name. Instead, it's kind of a combination of ""The Book of Three,"" ""The Black Cauldron,"" and, to a lesser extent, ""The High King"" (which translates into Prydain books 1, 2, and 5). Most of Alexander's best stuff has been removed, and Disney has inserted some pretty bad fluff in its place. The books are so wonderful that it's hard to believe anyone would want to butcher them so, but here it is nonetheless - and were it not for the fantastic animation, the good voice-acting, and the dark atmosphere (for a PG-rated Disney movie, anyway), it would be hard to recommend to anyone over the age of 10. At the same time, it's the only visual adaptation of the series you're likely to get, so that's saying something... perhaps. I just wish somebody would buy the rights and do something better with them - a couple of films or a miniseries, maybe.

It was one of the few Disney cartoons not based on any classic fairy tail. It was original. It was not formulaic like just about everything else produced by Disney before and since. Dark, dingy, and scary - oh yeah! Fearsome creatures, villain, and ghouls, oh my! Finally Disney began showing some guts, to go beyond the usual sugar coated fluff, kind of like Disney meets Dungeons and Dragons. The cutesy kid stuff was kept at a minimum (though not eliminated completely) and there was none of the usual song and dance numbers. Unfortunately it didn't pay off, and Disney went back to doing what it always had been doing. Sigh...

 If you're going to watch it, though, please DON'T read the books first. Read the books, by all means, but if you read them before watching the movie, you'll find the flick unbearable. Disney changed so much, and with no fathomable reason behind most of the changes. The changes to the character of Fflewddur Fflam hit me especially hard, since he's my favorite from the books -- apart from the name and harp, he's unrecognizable. Basically, everything's been simplified and, well, Disneyfied. All of the PG rating comes from visuals, and any bad things happening to the good guys are fleeting, unlike the books, which carry the more difficult -- but true -- lesson that life can be unfair sometimes.
 Anyway, in closing, the movie isn't bad, but as has been said, the books are far better. If you're thinking of buying it for your kids, especially, I'd highly recommend getting the books instead and sharing them. If they like Harry Potter, they're almost sure to like these.

Snow White, Cinderella, Sword in the Stone, to mention just a few, but the absolute worst was Pocahonas since that was history they were messing with!  Back to The Black Cauldron. They have totally changed so many things that if you know the story you may very well be sickened by what they have done to the story and it's characters.

My children have read the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander and although they immediately noted many discrepancies, they still thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

Please, please if you are the sort who loves outstanding children's fantasy literature, go buy the Prydain chronicles in Amazon's book section (there are some very nice sets) before allowing this to turn you off to the books.  I normally have friends who take my recommendations automatically, but who won't give these books a chance because they saw this movie first and hate it so much.  O.k., here's why.  The character's are flat and lack any of the wit of the characters in the books, let alone other Disney characters.  I especially hate Disney's take on good old Doli.  And while all movie adaptations must make some adjustments or liberties to translate a book to film, the drastic differences between the characters  in the books and in the movie are both unnecessary and render the characters dull and uninteresting.  By the end of the Prydain chronicles, you care so much about these characters that, if you are an avid reader, you will end up revisiting Prydain for years to come.  I can honestly say that after one viewing The Black Cauldron on videotape, it has sat on a shelf collecting dust, which is far better treatment than the incinerator it so richly deserves.  P.S. If you can find some good in this movie (and I understand some might, and that's o.k.), I still strongly recommend that you read the books.  With  authors such as Tolkien, C.S. Lewis (Narnia), Susan Cooper (Dark is Rising) and Ursula LeGuin (Earthsea), Lloyd Alexander was one of the outstanding authors who wrote fantasy literature accessable to both children and adults long before Harry Potter led to the current boom.

I am aware that Disney always changes classic stories (and sometimes history) to make their movies, and I'm usually quite willing to forgive them for it. After all, fairy tales and folk stories are passed on through word of mouth and change a little everytime someone new tells the story. Disney is just one of those voices. But when you take a relatively new work whose author is still alive and claim to be retelling the story, it needs to be somewhat similar. Honestly, the only thing accurate in the whole movie are the names of the main characters. They even got the color of Hen Wen's eyes wrong after such a big deal is made out of that point in the books. You'd think that would be a simple thing! But even this would be forgivable if Disney had produced a decent movie. But, in my opinion, this was not good at all. The plot was rushed and the characters shallow (except maybe Taran). I had seen this movie before I read the books and didn't like it at all. I watched it again after I read the books thinking that I would appreciate it more after knowing some background information, but it was even worse! Disney could have made a really good fantasy film if they had had the confidence to write their own story. Instead they were constrained by their ties to a highly regarded series of books that couldn't possibly be boiled down into an 80 minute movie with any success.

I honestly do not understand why so many people who have reviewed this movie have called it bad.  Sure, it's different, and yes, it did recieve a PG rating, but those are not nessesarily bad things.  And, yes, appearently it IS different from the book, but, putting all of that aside, it is a WONDERFUL movie, and, unlike some reviewers, I'm very glad that they let it out of the vaults.
Taran, dreams of being an incridible warrior, but soon finds himself reduced to searching for Hen Wen, a young pig he tends to that has run away.  This eventually leads to his embarking on a quest to find the mythical Black Cauldron, which gives the one who bears it ultumate power, before the evil Horned King.  Aside from the adventurous, dark mood, the movie carries other strengths, too.  First off, the characters are amazing and can be related to.  I too have dreams and fears just like Taran (in fact quite simmilar in one perspective), and he is like a welcome friend to me.  Gurgi is cute and funny and is this movie's classic Disney sidekick; there's one in every classic, you know.  Second, there's the annimation - it's amazingly mood-setting and obviously helped the animators learn a great viriaty of skills they would use in later films. Finally, there's the film's tear-jerking (yes, I did say ""tear-jerking"" in regard to Disney's ""The Black Cauldron,"" folks) ending and the timeless moral that is illustrated within it -- I won't say what it is; you have to go rent (or better yet buy) this too-often-ignored Disney gem to find that part out.  To top it all off, the original 1998 release has a very cool-looking cover, supposedly ""FX packaging"" according to some old TV spots; the Gold reissue has a wonderful (different) logo and cover image too.

Does it stack up to (...) films as Return To Oz and The Dark Crystal? Well, although not as complex as the aformentioned, this film is not without its charm.
The story of Taran, the pig-keeper's journey from gawky boy to gawky boy-hero apparently works better as told through the course of five books, and indeed it is the plot that feels put together, with a lot cut out of it for it's slim 1:20 running time. Also suffering becuase of the short time is any character development, or a reason why the charcter of Dallben (an old minstrel) are in the film at all. However, this film still has a lot going for it.
The film has a wonderful pacing to it with some fantastic action scenes. It is adventurous and fun. An engaing film for any fantasy fan. What really makes the film though is it's terrifying and dastardly villain, The Horned King. He is basically a Skeletor knock off with absolutely no sense of humor. He looks like he stepped right out of an Iron Maden album cover, and that is a monumental good thing. The true threat felt by the presence of this decidedly un-Disney character keeps the tension of the film high.
It is this contrast, between the unconventionally ghoulish villans (definatly enspirered by Bakshi's animated adaptation of Lord of the Rings ) and the stock Disney characters makes the audience care more-so for the cutesy characters than usual. This is especially true for the cutsey character of Gurgi, who is much more tollerable than almost all other Disney sidekicks and especially more tollerable than a certain J*r J*r B*nks that we have all been over exposed to lately.

Not one song is in this film, and that gives it a major benifit becuase it kept the film very serious and dark. A lot of the past reviewers have said that the animation is not very good. Aside from one scene, I strongly disagree with this. The animation is not extraordinary, but it does succeed in making the atmospheric mood a very dark one.
Besides, animation is not what carries this film, it's it's characters. Starting foremost, with the Horned King, a villian that goes beyond any bad guy before him using the Cauldron's magic to resurrect his army of skeletons. This provides one of the movie's most intense and dramatic sequences. The comedic relief in this film belong to Creeper, the king's goblin creature and Gurgi, a cowardly creature who redeems himself later in the film. Both do well in making us laugh, but not going too far to avoid taking the film's dark feel. Taran is the main character, but aside from knowing that he wants to be a hero, not much is known of him.
This film is greatly underappreciated, mostly becuase it was a severe economical failure. What Disney lost in $, they gained in creative expansion, beginning to be able to tackle many different subject matters for different audiences.

946643,4,6304978286,"Disney finally returns to the days of good vs. evil with very little compromise with their production of THE BLACK CAULDRON. This is a tale of swords and sorcery, evil, revenge and magic. It is the story of a search for a magic cauldron that if it falls into the hands of the evil Horned King, will be used as an abyss of endless evil. This Disney animated film is in the old tradition of SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO and BAMBI where some frightening moments and moments of real loss bring reality to the tale. THE BLACK CAULDRON had to follow this same mold to bring it credibility. If it looked too cute it would not work. You can see this same balance in SLEEPING BEAUTY. Good characterizations are the backbone of this film. The Horned King (coldly voiced by John Hurt), and a wooly little creature named Gurgi (voiced by John Byner) are the best. Gurgi is a great character who slurps and gurgles his way through this tale giving it that little bit of required levity. In fact the cauldron-born scenes were toned down before the release of this film. Taran the main character keeps the tale moving in a prerequisite and obligatory role. Creeper is one of the more memorable and noteworthy henchmen. ALL in all I think this is one of Disney's better films of the last two decades. I love the score by Elmer Bernstein that is lush yet whimsical.

I have read the novel to this and when watching the movie; noticed Disney has CUT/CHANGED it.  This movie is VERY LOOSELY based on the novel (if at all).  The novel is by far MUCH MORE darker, scarier and bloodier.
The characters are rather shallow and not well developed in the movie.  At least the plot's essence seems to be there, however alot less grimmer.
Disney also gave this its usual ""Disney (happy) ending"" (as expected), when the novel ended on a much more dismal/darker note.
I do not understand why Disney is afraid to do any ""teen/adult animations"".  I guess they have a reputation to be ""family"" entertainment.
Although the animation was good, it was the CHANGES they made that had me VERY DISAPPOINTED.
If an animated feature could be redone, I would prefer it to be done by Japan.  Since it seems they do animations in all different age groups (from children to adults only).  In fact if this could be redone, have another company do it, NOT Disney.",995068800,2,1079,4.652631578947369

But be very, very sure you understand that this is NOT a typical Disney film.  Audieces were very surprised this December with The Emperor's New Groove.  I loved the movie because it owed more to the Road Runner and Tom & Jerry cartoons than the usual Disney fare.
But an awful lot of Disney fans felt cheated.  They could not stand the movie.  I know you were there, because you were complaining behind me all the way back to the car.
If you were one of those people, avoid The Black Cauldron, too.
You'll just upset yourself.  And Disney has lots of other great films you'll like better.
For the rest of you:  It's a little darker than the standard Disney fare. No hummable music.  No singing man-beasts.
And not much humor.
For the adults out there, I think this is an important movie animation-wise. Bakshi worked on the film.  Fans of Bakshi's Lord of the Rings and Wizards willrecognize and appreciate the style.  Bakshi's shadowy, haunting world of the dead captures the feeling of helpless souls lost in the fog.  Of course, for your eight year old, there are still cartoony zombies, monsters, et al. so necessary for the plot. :)

Well I haven't read the books but that might make me more objective cause I DO love this movie.  I love dark stories and this is indeed a dark story. I mean in what other disneymovie do we get to see Undead.
Personally this is my favorite Disneymovie. It has magic, dragons, rather creepy villains(they could be straight out of a horror movie) and faeries. Also very noteworthy is Eilonwy. She's my favorite princess from all the Disney movies.  It's funny to see how clumsy she and Taran act around eachother. Speaking of him. I think he's believable. He shares my wish to be great someday. Too bad I don't live in a magic kingdom tho... o well :)
Sure this movie looks a little dated compared to more recent Disneymovies but I mean we're talking the 80's here. When they didn't use 3D modeling to make 90% of the movie.
All I can say is that this is a charming movie which is way underrated. And that it's more likely to appeal to people with a darker taste(people who like Tim Burton's work for example) than to the typical Disney fan.

946699,2,6304978286,"This is Lloyd Alexander's ""Black Cauldron"" on video. Sure, Dallben wears a skirt, Arawn and the Horned King are a single character, Fflewdur Fflam is a cowardly old man, the Fair Folk are flying, glowing gnomes, gwythaints are dragons, Arawn seeks the Black Cauldron instead of owning it, his armies consist of stupid barbarians instead of the deathless cauldron-born, Henwen doesn't run away, Orwen, Orddu, and Orgoch are standard Halloween witches, Taran trades Dyrnwyn for the Crochan (which isn't referred to as such), and Coll, Gwydeon, Ellydyr, King Smoit, and Arwen are absent altogether, but, really, do you care? I certainly do!
This video's title is very misleading; rather than following the book it shares its title with, ""The Black Cauldron"" is a mish-mash of that book and ""The Book of Three"", with some Disney cartoon formulas thrown in for good measure (such as a cute sidekick). There's some good dialog with fairly authentic English accents, but all characters' mannerisms from the books were dropped, resulting in some boring word exchanges.

946700,4,6304978286,"Taran is a young pig-keeper growing up in the mystical, medieval land of Prydain. Actually, he's just an assistant pig-keeper, but he dreams of being a great warrior one day. When he discovers that the pig he keeps has magical powers to see the future, he is sent on a journey to hide little Henwyn from the terrifying and brutal Horned King. The evil, zombie-esque monarch has plans to use the pig's abilities to locate the Black Cauldron, a demonic, enchanted cauldron with the power to create an army of undead and unstoppable warriors. Not long after he embarks on his quest and encounters a mischievous and adorable woodland creature called Gurgi, Taran quickly loses Henwyn to the Horned King's flying beasts.  He then must venture into the castle of the Horned King himself to get Henwyn back. After a daring escape with the aid of a magic sword and a beautiful young princess held captive, Taran and his new friends, which also include an elderly minstrel they rescued from the dungeon, set forth in search of the Cauldron with plans to destroy it. Their travels lead them into an underground fairy world, to the home of the delightful and dangerous witches of Morva, and right back into the castle of the Horned King, where their worst fears become reality and only the most loving and unselfish act can save all!

""The Black Cauldron,"" based on the Prydain books by Lloyd Alexander, is a must see film for the Disney and animation aficionado, despite how you feel about it afterwards. It comes from a very important transitional period at the Disney Studios, when most of the animators on staff were new to Disney filmmaking. The result is more of a technical accomplishment than anything else; an attempt by ambitious new animators to show off the extents of their talents and skills that... sorta blew up in their faces. In short, it's a good animated film, better than most non-Disney, American-made animated films, but one that is not quite up to the Disney standard in the storytelling department (like some of the very new stuff) and that was a huge disappointment to the Walt Disney Company in general.  ""The Black Cauldron"" was released in 1985, meaning this film came after ""The Fox and the Hound"" but before all that great Disney stuff from the late 80s and early 90s. Ever since the loss of Walt, the Disney Studios had been trying to get its groove back, and it took a while. In ""The Black Cauldron,"" we get a visually stunning film for its time, though the ""amazing visual effects"" are actually pretty dated by today's standards, and, though it's quite appropriate, the entire film has that same `80's fantasy film look and sound that so many others of the time had. It's a difficult thing to describe, but obviously there is a cult-like following for that style. And, there's a cult-like following for this film. It's been considered the black sheep of the Disney animated feature canon since its disappointing release, and this is actually pretty sad, because it deserves better than that. While it lacks a certain quality that can usually be found in Disney storytelling (perhaps it's just that shiny, happy, G-rated aspect that the film intentionally avoided which is missing), it is still an entertaining film (surprisingly similar to the Lord of the Rings saga in certain ways) that seems to get better with repeat viewings. Perhaps the character of Taran could have been more likeable, but Cauldron does, in my opinion, have the most charming Disney princess to date, the beautiful Princess Eilonwy. True, my favorite Disney girls are Ariel and Tink, but Eilonwy is right on that second tier with Belle and Kim Possible, and she truly is the most charming. It's a true crime that she isn't on all those posters and sleeping bags with the other princesses. In addition to the evil Horned King, voiced well by John Hurt, there's one other highly memorable character in the film: the creature known as Gurgi. This furry little critter, voiced by comedian John Byner (Transylvania 6-5000), is easily the star of the film. This is probably a major problem with the storytelling. He really shouldn't be the star. He's comic relief. Still, he's a loveable animal you won't soon forget, and at least he wasn't just comic relief for comic relief's sake. That is sometimes just flat-out annoying. I even have an old plush toy of him from the film's release, which is pretty cool to be able to say (I've got Henwyn too).

Probably even more significant to this film's legendary status in Disney history than being a black sheep or claiming the first use of computer technology in a Disney animated film, is Disney's first straying from the usual formula, going for a much darker mood overall; going for that PG rating. This film is violent, occasionally vulgar, and surprisingly horrific at times. No singing dogs and cats here. In fact, I hear the producers actually cut some completed scenes they felt were TOO adult. I'd love to see that stuff on a future DVD release, but I don't expect to. This is probably the trouble with the Black Cauldron. It's not saccharine enough for little kiddies, but it may still be too cute  for most adults. It's an anomaly in that respect. It's like two completely different types of films: ""The Sword in the Stone"" meets ""Heavy Metal,"" without the rock `n' roll. It takes a real animation lover to enjoy it, I suppose. Oddly enough, despite the studio's desire to forget ""The Black Cauldron"" after it flopped in theaters, a very popular animated television series premiered from Disney a short time later with some far too clear similarities to the ""cute aspects"" of Cauldron. That show was ""Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears,"" and it truly was a great show, but it really is pretty much the Black Cauldron without the Cauldron, without the Horned King, and without any of the other dark, frightening stuff. They had characters VERY similar to Taran and Eilonwy (Princess Calla is another charming, beautiful, and overlooked Disney princess), multiplied Gurgi by 6 in the form of bouncy little bears (and added more later), put them in another medieval setting, and simply replaced the Horned King with a mustache twirling buffoon of a renegade knight who even had a little, green sidekick (as did the Horned King). Hey, the cutesey, G-rated formula worked. Here in the U.S., the idea that cartoons are just for kids is taking a LONG time to get over, even with some of the stuff we have today. Still, I loved the ""Adventures of the Gummi Bears.""

Having ""The Black Cauldron"" on DVD is a real treat to watch again and again. It is not without its cool factor. There are some fantastically animated scenes that one is not used to seeing in a Disney film. I can't rave enough about sweet Eilonwy, and even if you don't like to experience it in excess, that `80's fantasy style is a real trip now and then. The film is presented in its original and glorious widescreen format, and the disc comes with a few great extras. You get a theatrical trailer, a trivia game, the Donald Duck CLASSIC short (and a Halloween season MUST WATCH) ""Trick or Treat,"" and some really cool galleries that include bits of a Tokyo Disneyland park attraction and even some development art by Tim Burton! Including the ""Trick or Treat"" cartoon was wonderful for the Disney animation fan! This is an old Donald Duck short where Huey, Louie, and Dewey are granted help from a kindly old Halloween witch to get their prank-playing uncle to part with some Halloween candy. It's a real fave! There's plenty to see in the galleries, but this is clearly not the whole enchilada. One keeps a glimmer of hope that ""The Black Cauldron"" will get a 2-disc release someday featuring even longer galleries (I especially like character development stuff), just as one holds out hope that Disney feature animation will once again find its lost ""groove"" for the current and future generations. In the meantime, if you are open-minded to animation that is a little more adult in theme, but not entirely, and if you like the fantasy genre, pick this fine edition up, but do it for yourself first, not for your kids.

THE BLACK CAULDRON may be the most ambitious  film in Disney's history (at least of that era), but yet is one of its  least memorable endeavours.  It's not the worst film Disney has ever made,  but it just doesn't rank up with the ""classic"" characters and  stories it is famous for.  The only truly memorable character in THE BLACK  CAULDRON is the comical little Gurgi, who ironically is nowhere to be found  in Lloyd Alexander's series.

The most spectacular moments are when  Taran and his friends are confronted by the Emperor King in his dark,  creepy castle.

On the way, our hero  meets several companions who help him on his journey. The animation was  good in this film, but no animated movie can fully capture the essence of  Lloyd Alexander's book series.

946756,4,6304978286,"Not too many remember when this movie was released... it BOMBED in theatres.
Why?
 For starters, no one was ready for a PG rated Disney cartoon... especially one that IS NOT a musical.  I think it lasted about two weeks in the theaters, then Disney pulled it.

(Something else people might not realize is that, while a failure in theaters, The Black Cauldron was modified and ported over into TV. It became one of Disney's most successful animated  TV series: The Gummy Bears.  While Taran, Eilonwy, and Creeper are renamed and not the main characters, they are in there!)

Left in the Disney vaults until 1998, this now restored full-length animated feature is a gem, if not a bit rough around the edges.  Without your standard ""filler"" material of songs and silly dancing, The Black Cauldron uses dialog, stunning animation, and action to keep it moving.

The movie is dark, foreboding, and just plain creepy. It is rated PG, and I DO NOT recommend letting your kids sit in front of this  one alone!

But for all its good points, The Black Cauldron strays far from Lloyd Alexander's books, too much is left unexplained, and you never get the chance to really care for any of the characters.  Compared to other Disney movies, this is a major change as we're always drawn in and quickly bond with the lead characters.

Okay, it is true that the characters could be developed a bit  more, but does anybody really concentrate on development while watching a  Disney movie?

I saw a boring, lifeless movie with  little or no heart and too much emphasis on being a dark, spooky fantasy  adventure.  The animators must've forgotten to breathe life into the  characters, because almost all of them are unmemorable and shallow.  Gurgi  steals the spotlight and also proves to be the most heroic, but at first he  comes off as just a silly creature and a thief.  The villain will frighten  young kids, and the movie tries to be scary just for the sake of being  scary.  There is no real drama here, only eerie effects and lots of living  skeletons.  Almost all of the conflict is external, and even then it's  cheap.  Equate The Black Cauldron to the stereotypical villain who laughs  cheesily at the captured heroes and reveals his plans to them before trying  to kill them, and you're not too far off.  Besides the fairy tales, Disney  must not have done a fantasy story before because in an attempt to make a  dark fantasy tale, they forgot to throw in the things important to all  tales.  With that said, it's certainly not the worst Disney movie.  I think  Hercules takes that honor.  A lot of people like The Black Cauldron, too,  so I'll take my chances and say rent it first.

946804,1,6304978286,"The Black Cauldron is a conflation of the first two Prydain novels, and to get them together, they drop most of the interesting characters. The books were never about just Taran and Eilonwy (sp?), but also Adaon, Annlaw  Clay-Shaper, and the other dozen-or-so memorable characters who drift in  and out of the narrative. On top of it all, the ending is turned 180  degrees around from the original meaning -- unforgivable. At least with  ""Hunchback"", there were precedents in earlier versions...",931910400,2,495,5.074074074074074
946805,4,6304978286,"This movie is sure not one of Disney's best, but is a quite interesting move from the ""Disney-style"". I loved its dark atmosphere and the animation was really good. The only problem I see with The Black Cauldron  is in the script. It all happens too fast and there are pointless  situations that just interfere with the main plot. I think with a better  script it would have been a great movie worth 5 stars (despite its PG  rating).",923961600,,433,4.443037974683544
946806,1,6304978286,"Lloyd Alexander wrote the PRYDAIN CHRONICLES,a well written collection of adventures containing many characters based on Celtic mythology.  Alexander's work retains the original mystical flavor and morality of its  mythological model. The Disney version telescopes the saga into a trivial  adventure featuring two children, a nice pig,and a cute little animal  mostly being chased by horrifying villains for reasons mostly unclear.

7880081,1,6304978286,"So...in the credits there are 9 people listed as having written the story, based on L. Alexander's books...it would be better to say ""loosely inspired by"" and I'm shocked that this is the best 9 people could come up with.

If you have never heard of L. Alexander's Prydain, this movie will just be really weird. I agree with others who said it's not great for little kids - there's a little animal torture, hyper sexuality by Orwen, and dead people, oh and a suicide. So...yeah. Perhaps the only thing that might be good-ish-maybe, for someone who has never heard of Prydain, is how over-simplified this story is: bad guy, wants a bad thing; day dreaming boy goes afte rthe thing; bad guy gets stopped; everybody lives but the bad guy.

If you've heard of L. Alexander's Prydain...well, this isn't it. It's a weirdly sanitized-patronizing-to-children-voice adaptation that seems influenced by Scooby Doo, Masters of the Universe, and cutsey Disney simple-minded characters.

Eilonwy exists only in name - she's sort of there to be won by the boy - her lineage and purpose is never shown, and she's just candy - which makes me angry. Eilonwy is a hero in her own right int he books.

Oh, and most characters are just removed - it's only Taran, Eilonwy, Gurgi, Fflewddur, Dallben, and Doli. None of them are remotely close to anything in the Prydain universe. And Hen Hen is a cuddly baby-like pig.

It's just a weird ride. I guess if you have a 10 - 12 year old who has never heard of Prydain, this might be something to keep him or her occupied.

But do them the favor and the gift of getting the books series - it's far far more complex and inspiring and funny across five short books than this film was. And that's the real shame - The Chronicles of Prydain are really fantastic, funny, and inspiring, even as an adult. I've read them, beginning in Jr. High, more times than I can count, and am pushing 50 now. I still find things in them, they still resonate and move me. This film could have done at least some of that, but failed miserably...and even as a non-Prydain fan, it won't be worth the time and will leave you feeling just ...weird.

Disney purportedly has the rights to and is considering a live=action adaptation of the books. I hope they don't screw it up like they did with this animated feature.",1525392000,,2314,4.56144578313253
