I enjoyed watching it myself.  Now my grandaughter will pat the seat next to her and says ""come and watch Mommy Bear and Daddy Bear with me.""  It has multiple stories about the bear family.

Little Bear and the gang are a good way of learning sharing, caring and thinking of others.  Come to think of it, I love watching it too!  I would definately recommend any Little Bear eposide to anyone.

7961508,4,B000065KC7,"If you are looking for good cartoons for very young children to watch, the ""Little Bear"" series is an excellent choice. These videos are nonviolent, reasonably engaging and intelligent, and they generally teach good values and problem solving. It's not great art, but it is entertaining and won't insult your child's intelligence. Based on a series of books written by Else Homelund Minarik in the 1960s, this is good family fare -- you can park your kid in front of these films and not have to worry about disturbing or inappropriate content. Whew! Thank goodness. The episodes are short and each disc has quite a lot of content on them... a lot of bang for your buck. These have been big hits around our household. (ReadThatAgain)

NOTE: this disc is made up of previously released material taken from other ""Little Bear"" videos, organized around a new theme, so there may be overlap  between this and other discs you might already have,",1187913600,9,939,4.826086956521739
