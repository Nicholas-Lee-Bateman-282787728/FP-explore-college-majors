5361073,3,B009R1LPKC,Seeing I ordered and paid for Sons of Anarchy Complete Season 1-4 and received Complete Season 1-3 it's very disappointing! Plus a rip off!!!,1363651200,2,141,4.916666666666667

5361075,5,B009R1LPKC,"My husband loves Sons and he's been watching this show for years. However, he was told about the show from a friend so he hadn't seen it from the beginning. This DVD set has made it possible for him to see the beginning and plug the holes on what he missed. ie...how Smiley got his name. He also loved all the behind the scene material. I enjoyed being able to clear the 38 hours of space on our DVR. A DEFINITE gain for our household! Love it!",1359158400,,444,4.114942528735632

5361106,5,B009R1LPKC,I am so in love with this show.  Sons of Anarchy.  I did not know about this show until they were considering Charlie Hunnan to be Christian Grey.  I turned it on.  And what can I say.  I wanted more.  I am so damn happy that I got 1 to 4 I love this show. I think of it and the Godfather but on motorcycles.  Awesome show.,1385942400,3,323,3.7313432835820897
5361107,4,B009R1LPKC,I Love the set! I'd give it 4.3 stars if I could. Best TV action/drama series since 24! Go sons....,1382832000,,99,4.0
5361108,4,B009R1LPKC,"My order was processed and received quickly in perfect condition. My only disappointment thus the 4 star instead of 5 star rating is that the copy I received doesn't allow the selection in the set up menu for 5.1 surround sound. It is listed but when I try to move the cursor to select it, it backs out of audio set up. Seems to be a DVD authoring glitch. Typically BlueRay DVD auto starts in 5.1. My Bose system displayed 2.0 all the way through on all 3 discs. I was still able to view and enjoy the season but the discs should perform the way they are expected especially at full price plus shipping.",1381190400,,603,4.252173913043478

5361112,5,B009R1LPKC,"I am glad this one is running on FX channel.
I could not stop watching the series.
I was hooked.
Love Katie Segal and Ron Perlman.
The cast was believable and it takes a nod from the Sorprano's.
Just go for the ride - it's fantasy on a California level.
Biked, sex, stripers, cons, drug dealers, tattoo, sadism, horror, and lots of violence.
I love just watching the bikes fire up and roar down the road.
not my lifestyle, but worth watching again and again, so buy it !
I did and shared it.",1374969600,,491,4.23404255319149

5361114,4,B009R1LPKC,The product got here very quickly. The only reason there is not a 5 rating is the quality. The picture comes out fairly grainy most of the time. It may be just the first few episodes I have watched. But SOA is still a great show!,1373846400,,229,4.0
