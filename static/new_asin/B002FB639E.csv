8368899,5,B002FB639E,"Di Passaggio is a special film. It chronicles the journey of a diverse
set of individuals as they spend time studying in Italy, and end up
learning about themselves at the same time. Even though it is a
documentary, and was shot on location in Italy, the film vividly
renders each character. The narrative is incredibly strong, and the
film is one of the most interesting and engaging documentaries I've
seen. The title, Italian for ""Of Passage,"" is very appropriate; by the
end of the film you feel as though you have been on a journey along
with the students.

Perhaps the film's most valuable element, however, is its serious
introspective examination of the tragic events in Director James
Kicklighter's past, and the ultimately very constructive ways he moved
forward (including making this film). The film's handling of these
issues is moving and gracefully done. The dramatic tension which arises
from the juxtaposition of the study abroad experience and the
life-changing experiences of the director is wonderfully maintained
throughout, and moves the film beyond the ordinary into a truly
exceptional experience. I highly recommend it as a remarkable cinematic
adventure. Director James Kicklighter's reputation as a rising star is
well deserved, and I look forward to seeing more of his films to come.",1270857600,5,1311,5.154929577464789
