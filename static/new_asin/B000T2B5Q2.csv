8388021,4,B000T2B5Q2,"This DVD is composed of several pieces taken out of old films that dealt with studying basic concepts in Economics. The films are from 1940's and 1950's. So they are black and white, and also very poor quality. At the same time I got a kick out of it. It's funny to realize (again) how far we came on filming movies and TV shows.

On the content side: I purchased the DVD thinking I would learn a lot from it and hear some history. But it was way too basic. I found the DVD interesting since it repeated basic level concepts and I found out many small pieces of information that I didn't know before but like I said, too basic.
I think my 10 year old would get a kick out of the DVD, seeing the old black and white, low resolution films, and maybe also learn something about Economics.",1190764800,2,785,4.198675496688741
