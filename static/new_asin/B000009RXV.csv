7905753,1,B000009RXV,"i purchased this Video online and was very excited to receive it as me and my friend who ordered it are big time ski bums. the video arrived and we threw it in the VCR and it was rejected right away, we tried again same thing. We soon realized that the tape inside was not connected between the spools. so we had to find a mini screwdriver take the thing apart connect the tape between the spools and put this delicate and ancient video back together. the bill was $80 canadian by the time it reached my home and for that price you should not have to put your VHS together yourself. You would expect it to come this way. In the end it worked after an hour or more of messing around with it, still disappointed!",1328918400,,710,4.189781021897811
7905754,5,B000009RXV,"The video is great and the VHS adds to the old school feel and approach of the crazy stunts and ski fashion seen in the video. As the owner of two early Burton snowboards and 2 old school Monoskis, this is a gem!

I need to find the other two episodes now so I can stop watching clips on the tube of you.",1322438400,,304,3.8253968253968256
7905755,5,B000009RXV,"This is the best French monoski I have ever seen fried off my a55 in a garage apartment in southern Vermont.  It was so great I would trade my Bole glacier glasses for a DVD copy.  If I could find more than one other person who monoskiis, I would love to show it to them.  I liked it better than Star Wars, and I like THAT movie so much I decorated an entire guest room in Star Wars dcor.",1135123200,,388,3.8860759493670884
7905756,5,B000009RXV,"Only one thing : I'm French and used to ski in the Arcs resort (miles and miles of track, one of them is so steep you need a 6 feet jump below just to get ON the track), and I have just one thing to say :
[...] PLEEEAAASE FIND US THIS MOVIES !![...]
I have seen Apocalypse Snow I, II and III back in France 15 years ago and am looking for them, either in France or here. I just want to see again this tandem-mono-ski jump, the catamaran, the snow-rafting, the so funny ""ski-chair"" race, the stunts, and of course this early snowboarding... I wanna see everything :) Pleeease!
Amis de la glisse, it is worth every video you've ever seen on this subject...",1012435200,,654,4.198412698412699
7905757,5,B000009RXV,"IF YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND THE OTHER TWO APOCALYPSE SNOW MOVIES, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THEM FOR YEARS.
Apocalypse snow features some of best mono-skiing I've ever seen. In this movie, you'll see a snowboarder and mono skiers outrunning avalanches and straight-shooting 2000 foot vertical without carving a turn, struggling to keep their boards from flying away. It's got a James Bond style plot with the snowboarder trying to outrun the monoskiers. One fellow is even inserted into a giant beachball and rolled down a chute. The skiing isn't cheesy, like many Warren Miller movies, these guys are good.",971395200,3,626,4.9714285714285715
