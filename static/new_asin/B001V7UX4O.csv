Since I watch PM over and over, in my humble opinion, this is money well spent because it keeps on giving enjoyment.",1238025600,26,293,4.444444444444445
3819219,5,B001V7UX4O,No doubt the price for this half season release is high and raises the eyebrows of potential buyers.  I think we must assume that this price increase is the result of low sales volumes on previous releases.  I don't like the price but I would rather have the DVD's at the higher price than no release at all.  Please don't let the Perry Mason series follow the lead of Ironside where the studio released two season and then quit!,1237939200,50,429,4.405063291139241

3819270,5,B001V7UX4O,"Perry Mason Season 4 Volume 1

These sixteen TV films from 1960 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The original books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is unknown to most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the Court of Last Resort which sought to free the innocent convicted. Gardner, and others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone. Note the vacationing Bill Tallman here.

Often the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with firearms. Smoking was very common [a tobacco sponsor]. The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings (no need for a jury). The cars tell of product placement. A story adapted from a novel has the year.

However, on this volume, none of them are based on a Gardener novel. But they are very good none the less!

William Tallman doesn't appear very (if at all!) as Perry's chief legal adversary, Hamilton Burger, but the other actors who serve as the prosecutors do an adequate job as fill-ins. There is one notable actor who was a defendant in a season one episode that could have made a good replacement for Tallman had the powers that be not come to their senses and rehired Tallman.

Ray Collins appears sporadically in both volumes as Lt Tragg, but is always listed as one of the main actors. He's always missed when not on screen, but occasionally there is an actor who does an adequate job as a fill-in for him.

Quality-wise the DVDs are very good. The episodes for the first disk froze when first played, but did not on a second viewing. Did not have any problems on any of the other disks on either volume.

I almost passed up these two volumes, based on what other reviewers had said about them; I'm glad I didn't!",1387152000,,1140,4.333333333333333

it's hard to recommend a show this old to the people who weren't born before bell bottoms and platform shoes, but if you like noir and beautiful old cars and settings (long before southern california became the morass it is today), then this show is something you'd probably enjoy.  although, it is very sad to see how some of the plots are about people who are greedy and just want to sell ""worthless"" land so more malls and apartment buildings can be built.

3819516,5,B001V7UX4O,"He warned us about Godzilla, he was the bad guy of choice for over a decade and he beat the crap out of the district attorney Ham Burger for years and years. Raymond Burr was never quite leading man material, despite scores of movie roles from Bride of the Gorilla to Hitchcock's Rear Window, San Quentin, Raw Deal, Fort Laramie, Blue Dahlia and A Place in the Sun. Burr remained in the shadow land of featured players, working constantly but never quite hitting the mainstream of recognizable faces, until Perry Mason. And, after filming 271 episodes of Mason, he went on to the TV series Ironsides, then returned, at the end of his career, to 26 two-hour TV movies, again playing Mason. Burr filmed the final installment only a few weeks before his death. From 1957 until his death some 36 years later, he worked constantly.
  Burr was born in British Columbia in 1917, and spent his younger years traveling with his mother, a single parent, who was an itinerant piano and organ player for movie houses and churches. He then worked as a ranch hand, a forest service fire guard, and a variety of other odd jobs until he settled on becoming an entertainer. After a brief period as a nightclub singer in Paris, he returned to America and worked at the Pasadena Playhouse. After stage work on the west coast and in New York, he made his film debut (unbilled) in 1946 as Claudette Colbert's dancing partner in Without Reservations.
  And now, for his ""private"" life . . .
  Raymond Burr met Arnette Southerland while touring with an English Rep Company in the early forties. She died in the same plane crash that killed Leslie Howard in 1943. They had a son, Michael Evan Burr, who died of leukemia in 1953. A brief marriage to Isabella Ward ended in annulment in 1947. His third wife, Laura Morgan, died of cancer in 1955.
  This tragic tale of love and loss is made even more tragic by the fact that most of it is a complete fabrication. There is no record of Arnette being in the plain that crashed with Leslie Howard, and there is no record of Michael Evan Burr ever existing. Further, there is no record of Burr ever marrying Laura Morgan. There is a record of the annulment of the Ward marriage.
  The closet is large in Hollywood. It's thought being gay could ruin your career, even today. That debate is open and ongoing, but there can be no doubt that being gay was a severe handicap in the pre-Stonewall era of gay liberation. It's easy to say today that people don't care about anyone's sexuality, and that may be true. But in the time of Rock Hudson, George Nader, Tab Hunter and Raymond Burr, there can be no doubt that any hint of sexual peculiarity would mean instant dismissal from Hollywood-no money, no career, no friends, nothing. And this can be a pretty horrifying place to be.
  So gay men, and women, married, dated, were seen around the town with members of the opposite sex, and remained in the closet. Lavender marriages, or marriages of public convenience, were commonplace. Two very popular ladies, just close friends, one an international stage star, the other ditto movies, took adjoining farms in Brazil with their respective husbands, a manager and a costume designer. That is one deep closet, stretching from Broadway, and Hollywood to the forests of Brazil.
  Raymond Burr had a very interesting attack to keep the door tightly locked on his closet. By creating a fiction in the past, in many way it allowed him to live more comfortably in the present. Certainly a double widower who had lost a child would not be subject to scrutiny about his sexuality. And if this seems extreme and faintly heartless today, just think of the atmosphere that made it necessary. You couldn't love who you chose openly, you'd be fired in a minute. When L.B. Mayer told William Haines, the highest paid star in Hollywood some 25 years before Burr arrived, to give up his boyfriend, Haines told Mayer that he would . . . right after Mayer gave up his wife. In that instant, William Haines, movie star, became William Haines, interior designer. But at that point, Haines' career was behind him. And, most importantly, damned few other performers had the guts or the ability to stand up for their own sexuality. And consider how much worse it would be to pretend not to be gay and marry a real person who loved you, rather than making up a couple of fictitious wives. Cruel circumstances produce cruel solutions.
  Since his death in 1993, rumors have abounded about Burr, that he supported a stable of hustlers in Hollywood in the '50s, that he had a bachelor pad in Palm Springs with Rock Hudson, and any number of equally seamy stories. One interesting thing about Burr is the absence of any such innuendo during his lifetime. The '50s, '60s and '70s were not all as innocent and devoid of the sleazy rumor mill as we might recall, given Hedda, Louella, Confidential magazine, and snitches everywhere looking for a leg up in tinsel town, willing to trade gossip for position and status.
  Yet, Raymond Burr remained untouched. No contemporary gossip about his sexuality seems to exist. Some years ago in a film festival in Palm Springs, Raw Deal was shown, and Marsha Hunt, the film's star, was present. Burr played a particularly menacing villain in the film who was a pyromaniac---at one point he throws a flaming pot of cherries jubilee into a woman's face. After the screening, there was a question and answer session with Hunt, who is indeed a very classy dame. She was asked if she was aware the Burr was homosexual, and she took a pause, smiled graciously, and said, ""Ray was one of the nicest men I've ever worked with, but this was a low budget film that had to be made very quickly, so we really had no time to discuss his......er....gaiety.""
  Burr was a tremendously kind and generous man who in the course of his life sponsored well over twenty foster children and gave large sums to charities. He paid for his own trips to Korea and Vietnam to visit American soldiers caught in a foreign war. After his televison career took off, he was known to be extraordinarily generous to performers whose careers had fallen on hard times. He was fiercely protective of co-workers, threatening to walk off the set if any were treated in a manner less than what he considered professional. In 1965, he purchased an island in Fiji, where he vastly improved the quality of life while pursuing his passion for the cultivation of orchids.
  This is one of the few Hollywood tales with a happy ending. Burr met his life partner in 1958, former actor Robert Benevides, and they lived together for 35 years, until Burr's death in 1993. The two moved to a ranch in Sonoma Valley, and decided one day to plant some grapes. Today, Benevides is still overseeing the Raymond Burr Vineyards.
  Burr spent his final days in Sonoma Valley, where the two men had been regarded as a couple for many years. In his final weeks, Burr refused to see anyone but his closest friends, and threw a series of ""farewell"" parties to keep up everyone's spirits. Forty eight hours before his death, he told Benevides, ""If I lie down, I'll die."" Benevides told TV Guide, ""He finally accepted death. Up until then, he had been fighting like an army of men to keep from dying. But in the end, a sweet death.""
Burr had a favorite quote, one, he said, that had brought him a great deal of comfort over the years. ""Try and live your life the way you wish other people would live theirs.""
  There may have been necessary compromises, but Raymond Burr's life and legacy continue to enrich us all.",1302134400,5,7572,4.63629574309186

3819522,5,B001V7UX4O,"This is a series of programs based a character in the writings of Erle Stanley Gardner. The CBS TV series stretched from 1957 through 1966.

Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) is a defense lawyer who is always thought of after it is too late for him to save the defendant from being accused of murder.  Supporting Perry is his trusty more than friendly but professional secretary Della Street (Barbara Hale). And their trusty and sneaky private investigator Paul Drake (William DeWolf Hopper, Son of the actress-turned-gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper). On the other side of the courtroom is the district attorney Hamilton Burger (William Talman) assisted by the not so neutral Homicide Lt. Arthur Tragg (Ray Collins).

You wonder how they get away with manufacturing evidence and the defendant usually has foot in mouth. Then there are the signature courtroom demonstrations.

Be sure to re-watch these programs as you can then see at even in TV programs they can sprinkle in subtle clues.

The was a mad magazine mock that had a boy scout immediately confess from the back of the courtroom upon seeing Perry mason.

Many of the subsequent programs allowed many TV actors of the time to become different characters and even replace the Burger and Tragg characters. You find yourself not only trying to outguess Mason but also saying ""Hey I saw that actor in...""

Even though the characters are from Erle Stanley Gardner the actual programs are written by many different TV writers of the day.

I have on occasion read some of the Erle Stanly Gardner Mason's and they are closely related. The TV version has a few less characters and has to write in some of our favorites.

The DVD's themselves usually have four episodes with a glaring lack of the extras that are so popular nowadays. The plus is that there are no advertisements.",1287100800,,1820,4.883116883116883

And it's usually not anyone with a WASPy name---never a Williams or a Holmes or a Johnson, always someone named Guido or Rothstein or something---so think ethnic character here, and voila, I find the perp before the jury does! Yep, Perry Mason is the single greatest booster of self-esteem since the date rape drug.

Over the decades, Perry Mason has become as much a part of American culture as apple pie and mom. You'd have difficulty finding anyone who doesn't at least recognize the name. Erle Stanley Gardner's books have millions of devoted fans. Beginning in more pulp style fashion, they gradually grew more to resemble the Perry of network television. Warren William had starred as Mason in a couple of nifty films during the early 1930's, but left after four films, Ricardo Cortez and Donald Woods following in his footsteps as it became a ""B"" entry. All those were actually based on Erle Stanley Gardner's original novels. The television show it spawned was fabulous entertainment, however, and today is widely regarded as one of the best shows television ever produced. Perry was the attorney you wanted on your side in a jam.

It was Gardner himself who picked Raymond Burr, even though the studio only agreed to let him test for Perry if he would test for Burger too! Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry. And we liked it that way. Warren William did, in fact, propose to Claire Dodd (Della) in the films, and had a honeymoon interrupted by mystery in his final entry as Mason.

A great cast for the other side made the television series sparkle as well. William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger would almost be ready to gloat, Lt. Tragg (Ray Collins) not far behind, when Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer on the witness stand. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable central cast of characters, made for terrific viewing. Those who haven't picked up any of the prior offerings, can catch up in this set of seasons 1-4!

For those of you who want to know where Hamilton Burger is during Season 4, Part 1 (he only appears in one episode) - here is an excerpt from Wikipedia.....

""William Talman was fired from Perry Mason for a short period. Sheriff's deputies suspicious of marijuana use raided a party in a private home in Beverly Hills, at which Talman was a guest, on March 13, 1960. The deputies reported finding Talman and other defendants in the nude. Even though a morals charge was made against Talman (and vagrancy charges and lewd conduct against others at the party), municipal judge Adolph Alexander dismissed the charge against Talman on June 18. ""I don't approve of their conduct,"" the judge ruled, ""but there has been no violation of the law established."" Despite this, Talman was fired when a ""morals"" clause was invoked in his contract--producers were afraid this incident would damage the show's image. However, Raymond Burr and the rest of the cast demanded the CBS network rehire Talman, and there was a deluge of fan mail demanding his reinstatement. CBS ultimately did bring him back on the set in December, 1960. But the incident (and possibly his typecasting as the never-ending loser Hamilton Burger) somewhat damaged Talman's career--other than Perry Mason he worked very infrequently as an actor from then on.""

So when the fourth season opens with an episode with Talman in the DA's chair I had to wonder. The answer was clear as soon as my wife started screaming, ""That's Robert Redford"". Sure enough it was Redford six  years younger than he was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barefoot-in-the-Park/dp/6305537356/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barefoot in the Park</a>&nbsp;in one of his first roles. And Redford was good  even if I won't say if he did it or not.

But the inclusion of the Redford episode tells the viewer that this compilation is not exactly a chronological recreation of the fourth season. The tryouts for the new DA have a few assistant district attorneys with some fire and personality but for the most part they were reading lines writen for Talman. His absence clearly detracts from the series.

The many superb character actors that appeared on the series is one of primary strengths of the show. These actors never walked the red carpet at the Oscars but they worked year in and year out in Westerns, B-movies and sitcoms. A face like Dabbs Greer's could never bring a leading role, but he appeared on screen and on television in 288 roles (some of them continuing characters) during his career. Greer is one of many just like him that inhabited the Perry Mason set.

3. Edited episodes.

4. Stopped production half or near the end of a show's run to offer the complete series therebuy shafting those who have already bought first, second, third, etc.,  seasons.
