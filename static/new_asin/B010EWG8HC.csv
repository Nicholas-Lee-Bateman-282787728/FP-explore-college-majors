8722279,5,B010EWG8HC,"The Origin episode 2 has been released! This time we see Casval and Artesia living in the Texas colony and some cameos from future Mobile Suit Gundam characters! The continued pursuit by the Zabis brings Casval to encounter someone who would change his life forever; Char Aznable!

This release is just like the first one. It's a single-disc Bluray that comes in a nice slipcase and contains the episode in Japanese as well as a fantastic English dub! A great release of you can find it for the right price! And yes, it will play on your Bluray player even though it's a Japanese release!",1468972800,2,588,4.6
