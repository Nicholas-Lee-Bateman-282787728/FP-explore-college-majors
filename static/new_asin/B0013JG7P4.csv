3112798,5,B0013JG7P4,"I am sure Alfred Hitchcock must have known about this 1946 RKO film when he was making his 1969 film of ""Topaz.""  Like the film before that, ""Marnie,"" in which Hitchcock told the psychological mystery through Freudian symbols, in his spy thriller ""Topaz"" he told the story less successfully through angles and colors like a topaz.  ""The Locket"" is also a visual piece of jewelry told via flashback within a flashback within a flashback manner in a neat beginning and end through doorways.  It too tells the devastating effects of a little child kept from having a possession, a locket, which is rightfully hers and the consequences of her actions on the men in her life.  Loraine Day, Robert Mitchum and Brian Aherne star effectively in  this unusual and original film directed by John Brahm.  This is an otherwise overlooked film noir gem that Warner Archive finally brings to DVD for American audiences.",1313798400,9,905,4.882352941176471
3112799,5,B0013JG7P4,I had seen this movie quite some time ago and I was pleasantly surprised that it was just as exciting this time around as it was the first time I saw it.  I think the acting is excellant and I just like black and white movies.  They add much more suspense to the story.  I will enjoy this movie time and time again.,1310947200,3,315,3.9682539682539684
3112800,4,B0013JG7P4,"RKO Radio Pictures presents ""THE LOCKET"" (20 December 1946) (86 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- The plot itself is relatively simple: Nancy (Laraine Day) is a kleptomaniac, driven to steal anything that strikes her fancy (the original title of the film was ""What Nancy Wanted"") --- Nancy's compulsion springs from a childhood incident, in which she was given a locket as birthday gift, which was then taken away from her by the cruel Mrs. Willis (Katherine Emery), her mother's employer --- But when the locket goes missing, Nancy is suspected of having stolen it to recover the trinket for herself --- Although it is later discovered that the locket simply fell in the hem of a garment, Nancy is never truly exonerated.

The world of The Locket is the domestic sphere in peril, in collapse, existing outside the normative values of postwar society, values that are themselves constantly in a state of flux --- The family unit is constantly celebrated in the dominant media as the ideal state of social existence, but is it, when so much is at risk, and so much is unexplained? --- For Nancy in The Locket, the answer is a resounding no.

Outstanding cast inclusive with top-notch performances, as Laraine Day gets prettier in every scene, this was her years of natural beauty.

3112801,4,B0013JG7P4,"This flashback laden melodrama has a fine cast and enough atmospheric noir touches to overcome a few unconvincing actions by the principals involved and keep classic film fans glued to the screen, waiting to see how it all finally plays out. The uneven moments of Sheridan Gibney's screenplay are smoothed over by Brian Aherne, Robert Mitchum and Laraine Day as a girl as messed up as she is pretty. Roy Webb gave another RKO mid-budget effort a solid score that fit every scene while director John Braham makes a film which could have been so hard to follow the audience lost interest into an entertaining entry in the noir cycle.

The film begins as Nancy (Laraine Day) is about to walk down the aisle. But psychiatrist Brian Aherne wants to keep another man from falling for the sweet demeanor of a woman he knows all too well. As he begins telling his tale to the groom, the viewer gets layer after layer of flashbacks, Aherne relating not only how he was in love with her, but how he too did not believe Norman (Robert Mitchum) when the artist came to him in much the same way. It is the flashback of Mitchum's twisted tale of woe within Aherne's that rivets the viewer, making this film seem better than it does on paper.

We see Nancy as charming, manipulative and, ultimately, so traumatized by an unfair accusation regarding a locket as a child that her entire life was changed in that moment. Yet the man who loves her can no more reconcile the sweet girl walking down the aisle with the mentally twisted picture of Nancy painted so vividly by Aherne than Aherne could the even darker depiction Mitchum's Norman gave him so long ago, before it was too late. Theft, murder and manipulation all play a part in this story within a story within a story.

While it doesn't have enough bite to leave marks like many of the great noire, and is somewhat of a disappointment considering the cast, it has some atmospheric scenes and nice performances from Day, Mitchum and Aherne which make up for the former. It is a film entertaining enough to be worth watching for fans of classic films, this particular genre, or any of the stars. Not one of the great noirs, but entertaining, and impossible to go wrong with this cast.",1262390400,15,2223,4.580402010050252
3112802,5,B0013JG7P4,"""The Locket"" is similar to ""Memento"" in that the format of the movie is as important as the plot. ""Locket"" is a flashback-within a flashback-within a flashback. You have to stay to the end to see how it all comes back to the present, and even then you get a surprise, like a cherry on top!

Now, if we can only get it in AMERICAN format!!! Whassamatter wichoo, Amazon???

3347339,5,B0013JG7P4,"Director John Braham  gave Laraine Day the role-of-a-lifetime when he uses 4 flashbacks to understand why Day is a combination kleptomaniac, liar and perhaps even a murderer. To get to know ""Nancy,"" she uses men like artist Robert Mitchum, psychiatrist Brian Aherme and is about to marry millionaire Gene Raymond when all of Nancy's past sins catch up with her and she has a total meltdown because of a ""locket"" she once coveted as a child.

And an excellent score by Roy Webb and one of the best of RKO's film noirs.",1359590400,4,517,4.608695652173913
