1467413,5,B00005JLFT,"ER is one of the best shows I've ever seen. I've been watching it from the airing of the Pilot and I've been hooked ever since. If you are looking for an emotional high this is the show to watch. The writers and actors are amazing. Each episode makes me laugh, cry, and gets my adrenaline pumping. This show confronts extremely controversial, contemporary issues and even though I'm not in the medical profession I believe that it is very realistic. Anyone who works with a lot of people day in and day out can relate to what it is like to be pulled in several different directions at once and still try to maintain a professional facade, which I think this show pulls off beautifully.",1033603200,30,685,4.488
1467414,5,B00005JLFT,"I've been watching ER since the first season.  When my youngest child went off to school this year, I went back to Nursing school.
Last year, my husband started watching with me.  He's just as addicted as I am.
This DVD needs to be made.  One day, when the show is over, I want my kids to be able to watch it.  My father taped M*A*S*H for years and I grew up on it.  ER is quality programming that I'd be proud to show to my kids.",1033084800,8,430,3.896551724137931
1467415,5,B00005JLFT,"As an avid ER watcher I have unfortunately missed a few due to soccer ball and tee-ball games, I would like to catch up. My husband just recently (within the last year) started watching ER and I would like for him to see the first year or twos episodes so he would understand how all of today came to fruition. Please encourage any ER lover to push for this series on DVD. As a nurse, this is show is the closest to real life in a drama series I have come across thus far.

1467523,5,B00005JLFT,"It's been many years since I watched an episode of ER and I had forgotten how good it was. It's streaming on Hulu right now and I picked it up from the premiere and binged all of season one. Some of the tech has not aged we, of course, but the character development and chemistry between the actors is still outstanding.

1467580,5,B00005JLFT,"I loved this show when it premiered all those years ago and love it now.  It was a pioneer in medical storytelling, nothing else has come close.  The rapid pace, chest-thumping in the elevators, all the drama of Cook County Hospital in Chicago; it's gritty, nasty, raw and real.  I had the pleasure of working with an addictions counselor who had been a nurse at Cook County, she said the scenes were extemely realistic and made your BP spike just watching.  Yeah, it's a show, but Thursday at 9 pm became a dedicated time.  My kids had instructions not to bother me unless I could see the blood from 40 feet.  What would Dr. Green say about that?",1510876800,,647,4.440677966101695

I was drawn to it after binge watching ""  The Good Wife ""( another show I never watched ) and became truly impressed with Julianna Margulies' acting chops. BTW-I had no idea her hair is naturally curly... Stunning. The entire ensemble in Season One are superlative... The writing exceptional. One caveat: Amazon is charging big bucks to watch via Amazon Video. Taking advantage of this series in accessibility are we, Amazon? Solution for future seasons: buy individual episodes that have been lauded in fan websites. $2.99 per is a little easier on the wallet than $33.00 bucks.

1468344,5,B00005JLFT,"I remember as a child getting to stay up late on Thursday nights in the 90s to watch ER with my mom, who is an ER and trauma nurse of some 30 years' experience. She would tell me what had been done right or wrong on the show (they got quite a bit right!). I dreamed of knowing what she knew and being in the world depicted on the show. Now, I am grown and a nurse myself, specializing in pediatric home care. One day I would like to work in the PICU.

However, the relationships, atmosphere, dilemmas, triumphs and tribulations of the ER staff are in some senses universal to all healthcare professionals: The desire for perfection while never being able to achieve it, power struggles among those who are supposed to be a team, work vs. family/personal life, being unable to help some patients, ethical dilemmas, finding your place as a new clinician, and the sometimes simply odd experiences of caring for the health and well-being of your fellow human. No other medical drama I've seen comes even close to showing it how it really is than ER, and I've taken a look at Gray's Anatomy, House, and others. All of them require a large suspension of disbelief on my part (first of all: Where the hell is their nursing staff?). With ER, I can simply turn it on and get lost in the story, even if medicine has taken leaps and bounds forward since the first season aired back when I was a kid.

The show is all the more satisfying for me now that the medical jargon is familiar to my ears and the experiences personal instead of second-hand. ER continues its excellence even well into the new millennium.",1461110400,8,1599,4.453924914675768

1468346,5,B00005JLFT,"I  grew up with ER. It was mandatory viewing in our house during its entire run. At least for my mom, I was not allowed to watch it until the later seasons, as I was very young when it started in 1994. Believe it or not, I'd never seen the pilot until I sat down to watch the show a few weeks ago. This is a great show, with a great cast.

Really, that's bad business considering I'm a loyal customer and bought the entire first season. I should at least be forewarned about this detail. I give five stars for the show itself. I figure this averages out to three stars. However, the character personalities are highly stereotypical. You have the likable guy getting a divorce ( a plot which is way overdone), the playboy ( who has some depth-which I like it when they focus on this), the rising med student (who everyone is rooting for-since he embodies the American dream), the egocentric surgeon, etc. The most unique character is Bob, and I am rooting for her and hope they don't write her out. Though they probably will. I think she's absolutely awesome. If you are looking for a show whose writers really took risks and wrote unique characters I highly recommend Northern Exposure (though the latter seasons greatly deteriorated).",1426291200,2,996,4.934523809523809

1469136,5,B00005JLFT,"""Love's Labor Lost"" served as my introduction to ER. At that point, it had been on for a number of weeks, but this was the first time my wife and I had a chance to watch it. Needless to say, we were both stunned. Heck, even today I get chills when I think about that episode, it was that good. Five minutes or so after the episode's airing came to a close I offered up the thought to my wife that if ER was this good every week, it may go down as the greatest series ever.

Of course, there was very little chance that ANY series could reach that level of greatness a second time, much less sustain it, but that didn't keep ER from trying, and it made for an excellent show that became the epitome of Must-See-TV.

That first season was most distinguished by the intensity; those take-your-breath-away moments of action that kept you on the edge of your seat as all you-know-what seemed to be breaking loose. Whether it be a shooting victim being brought in, or an already admitted patient needing a miracle to live, it was so well choreographed that you had no choice but to watch.

At the same time, the show was balanced with quieter moments that allowed you to not only catch your breath, but gaze into the lives of the doctors and nurses on the show.

Ultimately, it was the tremendous writing and the excellent ensemble acting on ER that made it work. All the action would have been pointless and the quieter moments hollow if it weren't for the writing and acting talent.

This first season was wonderful. Unlike just about every other show ever made, ER found its footing early. There didn't seem to be any point in that first season in which it appeared that any of the characters were just stumbling around while the writing and acting talent were figuring out what to do with them. Of course, there was some fine-tuning, but overall, I could watch this first season today and track how each character gradually changed (for better of worse) in subsequent seasons.

I ended up watching ER for another six years or so before other concerns ate up the time that I devoted to television, especially those shows featuring story-arcs that depended on me being familiar with the events of the previous few weeks.

When I was a regular ER watcher, there was no season during which I thought the show had lost it, and the first season, in my opinion, was the best of all.",1412553600,,2373,4.466512702078522

1469403,5,B00005JLFT,"My beginning to watch the show ER on DVD is just a tad less rewarding than Sir Walter Raleigh's  finding the Lost City of Gold, since in spite of its running as a highly rewarded and well received series for 15 seasons, I watched but one episode, the final one in 2009. Somehow, it never fit into my life on Thursday evenings. And, by the time I watched that one episode, it was long past being a very tired cast, crew, and format.

But, seeing it as it premiered in 1984, with a cast that was probably surpassed only by ""The West Wing"", it was crackling with life and excitement and humanity. Compared to it, the 2012 series ""Monday Mornings"" was a highly mannered, pretentious shadow of the real thing which was ""ER"". I could not keep my eyes off the screen, and I ordered Seasons 2 and 3 almost immediately. I can now look forward to several weeks of viewing the entire series at the rate of three to four episodes per night.

The main cast is quite good, but it goes to new heights when the show is peppered with some outstanding guest appearances such as ER chiefs played by William H. Macy and Michael ironside, and cardiac surgeon, CCH Pounder, plus brother in law Ving Rhames. At first, I'm surprised at the brusque treatment and ""guidance"" 3rd year medical student Noah Wyle gets from his 2nd year surgical resident, Eriq La Salle. This is about as close as ""ER"" ever gets to the prima donna characterization of a doctor on ""House"". In all other ways, it is the demonstration that ""House"" is a surreal abstraction of hospital behavior, far removed from reality.

One almost senses that the level of activity in the average day in the ""ER"" is exaggerated. I've been in very few Emergency Rooms in my life, and they tend to be relatively quiet. But then again, this is in downtown Chicago, and a teaching hospital, which probably has the mandate to turn down no one. In one episode, at night, during a heavy snow storm, we see for a small part of one episode, what the ER looks like when it is not busy. That didn't last long.

I have not yet seen any following seasons, but like ""The West Wing"" (same producer, John Wells), this show takes off from the opening scenes of the first episode, and never once drops the ball.",1383868800,8,2228,4.4376528117359415
1469404,5,B00005JLFT,"was very fast shipping, package came exactly as described, works great... overall we had no problems with anything and very pleased. will use again and recommend",1383609600,,161,5.230769230769231
1469405,4,B00005JLFT,"Want to see blood?  People with insane medical conditions?  Nurses and doctors rushing about in a frenzy trying to help everyone who comes in through the doors?  Go to the ER.  Oh wait, you can't do that just to observe?  Well then watch this show!

ER takes place in a busy Chicago hospital, in the Emergency Room of course!  Following a particular cast of doctors and nurses, each day brings new types of trauma to the ER.  But all these doctors and nurses have complicated personal lives as well and between that and the patients, sometimes the stress can get a little much.  But there are always lives to be saved.

Characters:
Anthony Edwards: Dr. Mark Greene
George Clooney: Dr. Doug Ross
Sherry Stringfield: Dr. Susan Lewis
Noah Wyle: John Carter
Julianna Margulies: Carol Hathaway
Eriq La Salle: Dr. Peter Benton

I could try to list all of the cast in this show, but it would take forever.  But there are a lot, and they all play varied and important roles.  The above named have the most screentime though.  Anthony Edwards is one of my favorites.  He plays a kindly doctor with an overbearing wife (at least in my opinion) and he's often the voice of reason.  Clooney, on the other hand, is the wild child of the ER, frequently playing cowboy and getting himself into intense, but short romantic encounters.  Stringfield is Susan Lewis, who is likable but has a bit of a temper even though she is supposed to be sweet.  Margulies took some getting used to for me, but eventually I came around and enjoy seeing her on the show.  Since she's the Head Nurse she has a pretty important role.  And then there's La Salle, who does a great job playing the some-what jerk of a surgical resident.

A tv show in a hospital is nothing new.  Which it is really why the actors drive this show.  Otherwise it would just be procedures, gore, and lots of sick people.  But with the cast and their different personalities and different lives, it makes it a little something different.  I do find the medical terminology intriguing, although I don't know enough to say whether or not it is accurate.  I'm going to assume that it's at least fairly accurate, or there would have been tons of outrage from the medical community when it aired.  Regardless, it makes for good viewing, and while not classified as educational, still better than some of the mindless cartoons out there!

I do want to warn viewers that there is blood and violence and lots of things that may disturb viewers.  It also deals with a lot of different social issues like suicide and abortion.  So if you're not prepared to watch things like that, don't watch the show.

I really enjoy this show and am looking forward to watching all the seasons I can get my hands on.

1469517,5,B00005JLFT,"""ER"" may have become more soapy and bombastic in its final seasons, but after watching a few episodes from the first season, it's easy to see how ""ER"" became such a phenomenon in the 1990s. The writing was often gripping, wel-paced, and well-acted. And while some of the situations were undoubtedly heightened for entertainment purposes, it contained a certain level of realism that is sadly missing from most scripted shows today.

The original ""ER"" cast also embodied the meaning of 'ensemble' better than most TV shows, past or present. Of course ""ER"" gets a lot of credit for sending George Clooney into super-stardom, but he wasn't necessarily the star of the show. No one really overshadowed others in the first few seasons, but rather supported them.  Anthony Edwards' brilliant portrayal of Dr. Greene did, however, provide the show with a sort of anchor that was sorely missed in later seasons.

There are many standout episodes of season one (""Love's Labor Lost"" with guest star Bradley Whitford [Josh Lyman, ""The West Wing""] in particular), but my favorite is ""Chicago Heat."" This episode doesn't have any big special effects or any big storylines. What it does showcase, however, is Dr. Greene's struggle balancing fatherhood and work...a kind of precursor to the struggle that will stay with him until his last appearance on the show many years later.",1366156800,3,1364,5.053333333333334

I ordered it late Sunday night and it was in my mailbox Wednesday.  I will be buying several more seasons except for about the last 3.

Recently, I bought the whole series and stated watching. Since then, I have stopped watching other hospital/medical dramas since I started watching ER. They just don't compare IMHO.

1469566,5,B00005JLFT,"E.R. ever since it's original debut has been one of the all time greats. Getting into the lives of the characters every week was amazing. Anyone who is into the whole medical genre loves this. By each episodes end you were anxiously waiting until the following week to find out what would happen next in Cook County's E.R. Doctor's Greene, Lewis, Ross, Benton, Medical student John Carter, and the others are always fun to watch. I still have a huge crush on Carol! I am alittle new to the idea of actually purchasing a season of something that resides on the amazon servers that you can see anytime you want but that you don't actually have physical possession of which take's alittle getting used to. I look forward to purchasing and watching more seasons of this exciting show that entertains as much now as it did way back in 1994 when it first aired on NBC.

They say that the original is always the best and in some cases that may be but to me all the ER seasons or at least up to season 9 are great.  The actors are all wonderful but who could not like George Clooney, his character in the first season is so heart warming and likeable I enjoy him a lot.  Anthony Edwards does a great job as Dr. Mark Greene, he never seems to let me down in any episode as far as his acting goes.  I recieved this series as a gift and have loved it ever since, with all of it's drama, comedy, action, and even some romance on top.  If you like medical dramas you will love ER season 1 cause it delivers a knock out performance.  During some episodes in the series when it was still on television I found myself hungary for more medical excitement when one episode would end and not come back on for another week.  I give this TV series DVD 5 stars based on the great acting, excitement, drama, directing, and overall writing.  For those of you wanting to know about shipping cost and the overall cost of the DVD, believe me it was well worth what i paid in the end, and the shipping was fast.

1469885,4,B00005JLFT,"It's probably unfair to compare this with other hospital TV series, but it's inevitable--at least, it is for me.  For the most part this is an excellent series, but not quite as good as ""Grey's Anatomy,"" because I didn't identify as closely with the characters.  Anthony Edwards is fine in the lead, and George Clooney is surprisingly good.  The one character I found distasteful was the one played by Eriq La Salle.  I don't think it was the actor's fault.  He didn't write the lines, nor was he the director.  It's just that his character is always negative and makes all sorts of contorted, smirking faces to show his displeasure at everything, and with everyone.

The story lines are quite good, and most of the characters feel exactly right.  The sets couldn't be better.  As an aside, however,I can't imagine why anyone would want to work in the emergency room of a hospital.  I have, alas, gone through emergency rooms as a patient, and it's amazing that doctors and nurses there can keep some semblance of sanity.

I did feel tense in watching the chapters of this dvd set.  It's bloody sometimes.  There are tragedies and very little happiness.  Will I watch subsequent years?  Probably not.  It's just a bit more graphic than I find entertaining.",1256688000,2,1256,4.74537037037037

And as the show is winding down its run I started getting a bit sentimental (for lack of a better term) and about the show and began thinking back how I was immediately captivated by it.  So I went and got the first season.

The first season recaptivated me again, and is a standout one among all these years.  Having not seen many of these episodes in quite along while they were fresh and powerful again.  If you are a newer ER fan and did not ctach these episodes you should get this because you will love them.  And if you have been a fan since the beginning, these are some of the biggest standout episodes and writing of the series.  Over time some seasons had some ups and downs, this one is solid.

1469893,5,B00005JLFT,"Some TV shows have a structure such that you can tell almost from the beginning how long the show has to live. As much as I love ""Scrubs"", that show is built around a few core characters, and once their stories are played out, that will pretty much be the end of that show. ""Cheers"" basically had a double length of life due to the fact it was actually two shows instead of one - the first 5 seasons with Diane and the last 6 seasons with Rebecca as the female lead. ""ER"" is different. It has a large cast of constantly revolving characters, and the storylines will always be there as long as there is controversy in medicine to merge with the personal drama. Early in ER's history, things were different. George Clooney's character, Doug Ross, was really the star of the show, although they did spread the stories around so that there was quite a bit of focus on the other characters too. This was a successful formula, but once Clooney became a star and a heartthrob he quickly tired of television and longed for the big screen. Thus, starting in season four, he is absent more and more as he goes off to make action films and the show began to look like it was going to suffer from ""Welcome Back Kotter"" syndrome, where John Travolta's success on the silver screen killed that show. After Clooney actually did formally exit stage left, the show changed the formula to its current one of spreading the action around with nobody in particular having the spotlight. I guess my point with all of this is, with ER already in its thirteenth season, this show could easily go on for years. The bundles of ER seasons are overpriced, so collecting this show season by season is probably your best bet. It's interesting to look at how season one was set up and look at the show today and see how it still holds up over time. At least, that is my humble opinion.",1174521600,4,1854,4.423976608187134

1469959,5,B00005JLFT,"Throughout most of the late 80s and early 90s, drama was essentially dead on television.  Most of the line-ups were sitcoms.  Popular shows were Cheers, Cosby Show, and Seinfeld.  Many of the popular dramas of the early 80s were all but gone or nearing their end.

In 1993, NYPD Blue came a long and cracked things open, but in 1994, ER exploded on the scene.  I still recall seeing the pilot episode for the first time.  Somehow I knew right away that I was watching television history in the making: this show was going to not only be around for a long time, but I knew it was also going to have a large audience.

Those of you, like me, who have grown a bit complacent and tired of ER in recent years may have forgotten the original cast, the stories, and excitement that started it.  I had forgotten just how good this show was.  I hadn't seen the first season since it aired, with the exception of one episode that I'd taped (Love's Labor Lost).

Another medical drama, Chicago Hope, made its debut the same year that ER did.  There's a big reason that ER won out.  While Chicago Hope had interesting stories, it was still using the old stationary motion from the dramas of yester-year.  ER revolutionized dramatic television.  In fact, many dramas today credit ER with its almost constant movement.  Rather than have its characters standing still, they moved.  They walked corridors at the brisk pace that ER doctors might.  Cameras whirled around a trauma patient as four or five doctors and nurses worked on the patient.  The camera movement alone created excitement and the good kind of tension that made you wonder what kind of emergency would come through those ER doors next.  Watch these earlier episodes, and you'll notice quickly that whenever there is a trauma, the music kicks in and cameras speed up their pace and movement.  For audiences were grew tired of the dull stationary cameras, this was new, fresh, and a whole lot of fun!

ER's original cast simply can't be topped.  Many actors and actresses have walked and continue to walk the halls of ER, but there's only one Dr. Mark Greene, played superbly by Anthony Edwards.  He plays Greene with a reserve and confidence of someone who makes everything look easy.  As the Chief Resident, he runs the ER, and he does it both smoothly and proficiently.  He's also a man conflicted between his job which he loves and his family.  Season one sees him trying to find a resolution between leaving the job he loves or risk losing his family.

Then there's womanizer, Dr. Doug Ross.  George Clooney plays Ross with all the charm and boyishness that seems to win women over with a look.  He's unable to commit, and he leaves a trail of emotional baggage a mile long.  Perhaps his former girlfriend nurse Carol Hathaway describes him best with the line, ""Doug is a little boy who wants what he can't have.""

Sherry Stringfield has wonderful as Dr. Susan Lewis.  She's cute and vivacious, and gives these elements to Lewis.  Lewis also has a problem standing up for herself.  She's generally a pleaser who is afraid of losing the affection and faith of those closest to her.  Perhaps her biggest nemesis is her own sister who is all but inept.  She and Greene are close friends, and one had to wonder if anything might come of it.

Eriq La Salle was a perfect choice to play the arrogant, driven, and extremely talented Dr. Peter Benton who is a second-year surgical resident.  Benton is devoted to his job and little else.  Someone can lose count of the number of times we hear him yell at the nurses, ""Come on, let's move people!""  La Salle makes Benton move at light speed.  He's always in motion, and even when he's stationary, you can see the energy that La Salle gives to Benton, that standing around is his least favorite thing.

Who has forgotten the great charm and clumsy character of the first year for Dr. John Carter played by Noah Wyle?  Before he became the proficient doctor we see in later seasons, we forget that Carter was a young medical student trying to survive his first year under Dr. Benton's instruction.  Carter was a slightly nerdish, always wearing suspenders and expensive shirts, and yet he's always at the center when a laugh is needed to break the tension.  Everything seems to happen to him.  He's peed on, vomited on, and another med student hands him the cardio paddles with the wrong end, thus sending three hundred volts of electricity into the unsuspecting Carter and sending him unconscious to the floor.

The stories are crisp and strong in this first season.  Quite possibly one of the best single episodes of ANY series I've ever watched is here.  Love's Labor Lost was an Emmy Award winning episode.  It's an incredible episode featuring Dr. Greene attempting to deliver a baby until things go horribly wrong.  Anthony Edwards was nothing short of perfect in this episode.  Try watching this one without feeling the stress and tension that Greene feels.  It's nearly impossible.

So, if you're anxious to recapture some fond memories with the original cast of ER and remember why this show started off so well, then you can't go wrong with the first season of ER.",1168300800,5,5168,4.664451827242525
1469960,5,B00005JLFT,"This is a wonderful medical drama.

I just ordered this show from Amazon, and want to say one thing regarding the double sided DVDs. It's true that they don't say side A or B. However, it's fairly easy to determine which is which. Side A, which is facing up when you open the case, has a green ring around the inside edge. It also says ""additional content on the opposite side of disc"" in small letters. The reverse side has no writing or coloring on it. So, that should clear up the double sided disc confusion.",1167609600,,512,4.333333333333333

1469962,5,B00005JLFT,I got into ER by renting the first disc of season one off of Netflix.  After that I was hooked and bought it immediately.  It quickly became my favorite TV show and quite a bit of obsession.  To me the first season is the best by far.  The current episodes lack the amazing characters of the earlier ones.  Every episode on these discs is great and so far none of mine have gotten scratched.,1149292800,6,391,4.22972972972973
1470082,5,B00005JLFT,"Okay, I remember in the early 90's when NBC was beating the other networks with hits like Seinfeld, Friends, and this bigtime drama.  Well, this was probably the really big hit drama during the early 90's that no one will forget.  Now, I don't recognize today's ER cast and the people seem more Hollywood than struggling TV actors.  So, this first season really defines the heart of drama on TV which is giving a chance to those struggling TV actors to really shine.  Well, I guess George Clooney is the only one to break out of ER with big success.  The others managed to get out when the scripts ran out of steam after the 4th or 5th season.

Well, the DVD treatment of this season is pretty standard.  Although I would have prefered a nicer box set with individual cases.  Anyways, the DVD package is a fold-away stack of double-sided DVDs.  Yeah, this probably was done to save cost so that the price would be affordable.  It's annoying to be super careful but hey, fewer discs in the end.  The menus are pretty much simple to use and some discs have extras.  My favorite was looking at the bloopers on the final disc.  Also, interviews with the cast was nice to see how the actors remember fondly on their times on ER.

The picture quality of the episodes are first rate and seems almost perfect as it was on TV.  I don't have any complaints on the transfer since everything looks crisp.  So, there are no overly dark scenes which are difficult to see.  Plus, the audio is well done but I wished there were English subtitles.  Sometimes, the doctors, interns, and nurses speak too fast in the action that you want to catch part of their dialogue.  This was a major letdown for me since this should be the standard for all US released DVD in general (TV, movies, etc).

Overall, this is a keeper and I would recommend this to watch again.  You really get to heart of disciple-pupil relationship between Carter and Benton as well as some funny fiascos of Deb Chen with trying to please Benton.  Plus, Dr. Ross and Nurse Hathaway plot is full of complications which is the more soapy stuff for daytime.  But, the writers balanced it off on the operating table and I think this season is probably the best in my humble opinion.  It makes me think that if doctors watched ER on a regular basis, then they would realize that the humanizing part of being doctors about understanding the patient is what we really appreciate.  Well, I just hope that my doctor turns out to be like Susan Lewis rather than Peter Benton.",1147392000,10,2515,4.486784140969163

1470085,5,B00005JLFT,"In the history of television, first seasons are rarely that impressive. I mean, a lot of times you'll hear people saying how remarkable the first season was, but when you compare to later seasons, it will pale.  Such is not the case with ""ER.""  ""ER"" got off and running with an incredible first season any show would be lucky to compare to.

It all started with a wonderful pilot.  Any other show would be lucky to have a pilot like the pilot of ""ER,"" as well.  Running two hours with commercials and an hour and a half withouht, it's simply spellbinding, launching off the series splendidly, introducing the characters and the style of the show that continues to this day.  The characters we meet in the pilot are:

Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards): Mark is basically the head guy of the hospital, and in the pilot, we become familiar with his hectic lifestyle and how he juggles his work and his family, not always successfully.  He has an annoying little brat daughter and a terrible wife, but this doesn't stop him from being perhaps the best character of not just the original cast, but the entire series.  Anthony Edwards makes Mark such a loveable character.

Doug Ross (George Clooney): This was the role that basically shot George Clooney off to superstardom, and he plays it well.  Doug is a tough but a irresponsible man and in the pilot we become familiar with his previous love affair with Nurse Carol Hathaway.

Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield): By far my favorite character from the original cast, Dr. Lewis is a tough and wonderful character (not to mention freakishly sexy).  Sherry Stringfield really lights up this role.  Unfortunately, when she returned to the show after several years of absence, it just wasn't quite the same, but fortunately we have the first two and a half seasons to treasure her wonderful character and the wonderful acting that Sherry Stringfield gave us.

John Carter (Noah Wyle): Carter is just a fresh faced, eager to learn young 20-something med student in the pilot, and he quickyl gets thrown into the exciting world of ER medicine and surgery when he has to deliver a baby just as the mother arrives through the hospital doors.

Carol Hathaway (Jullianna Margullies): The thing you'll probably notice in the pilot is that Jullianna Margullies is listed as a guest star, and not put with the main cast.  The plan was to have her die in the first episode, but fortunately she got to stay for six wonderful seasons.  This character represents a lot about classic ""ER"" and it definately one of the most interesting people to work at County General.  In the pilot, we learn a whole lot about her character when she attempts suicide and is saved by her friends at the ER.  The following episodes revolve very much around her and her returning to a normal life.

Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle): Benton is an arrogant little prick, but you have to love him.  It's funny to note that he does seem slightly different in the pilot, more eager and cheerful (not much, but whatever).  He gets some great moments in the first episode, but most noticeably when he performs an emergency surgery without assistance and ends up saving a life.

This is the cast.  Although the show as it is now (in its twelfth season) has a nice enough cast, it's just not the same as the original six, who stand together as a true television ensemble.

The first season is just wonderful.  The show rolls along smoothly, churning out storylines compelling, dramatic, heartbreaking, and often funny.  It's a perfect combination.  The first season also brings us plenty of classic episodes, including the famous ""Love's Labor Loss,"" which may have the saddest ending of any ""ER"" episode ever, as Dr. Greene cries quietly over the knowledge that he may have caused the death of a new mother.  The first season won multiple Emmys, and it deserved all of them and more.

Warner Brothers did a real nice job with this DVD set.  The episodes are presented in widescreen, which has caused some controversy, since the first six seasons of the show were filmed and broadcast in fullscreen format, but the bottomline is that the episodes look great matted and it makes them match with later seasons nicely, so I have no complaints.

1470088,5,B00005JLFT,"Nominated for 25 Golden Globes and 110 Emmys, including 7 for Outstanding Drama Series, ER has long been one of the best prime-time shows on television. Premiering in September 1994 on NBC, the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across America. Brought into being by Michael Crichton - famous Hollywood insider, novelist, and brains behind such films as Jurassic Park, Twister, and Timeline - ER fulfills its creator's ultimate vision (it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the ER. Since its inception, many cast members have passed through the halls of ER, many of them having gone on to become big stars in Hollywood...

ER follows the exploits of a group of emergency room staff who work in a busy Chicago hospital. The show attempts to examine every detail of the ER experience. From the exhilaration of saving a life to the tedium caused by mountains of paperwork, all the highs and lows are covered. In the show's first year, a number of regular faces staffed the ER. Doctors Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), Douglas Ross (George Clooney), and Susan Lewis (Sherri Stringfield) were regulars in the ER along with Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) and Benton's medical student understudy (and later ER doctor), John Carter (Noah Wyle)... Any given episode tends to run multiple plot lines throughout the show, interweaving scenes in short snippets intended to heighten audience emotion and create the aura of a stress-laden atmosphere. The show's high drama, coupled with subplots of the staffers' personal lives and the display of cutting edge medical technology, combine to make ER one of most adrenaline-inducing programs in television history...

The ER (Season 1) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the series premiere ""24 Hours"" in which a long day in the ER is made longer when multiple casualties pour through the doors following the collapse of a building and medical students report for training (marking the first appearance for John Carter's character). Meanwhile, Dr. Benton performs a heart surgery normally reserved only for senior staff members while the staff is struck with a personal tragedy when Head Nurse Carol Hathaway is brought in following a suicide attempt... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Blizzard"" in which a major snowstorm first leads to an empty ER and then (following a 40-car pileup) one with overflowing capacity, and ""House of Cards"" in which, while trying to keep up with Carter, Deb nearly causes a patient's death...

1470089,4,B00005JLFT,"There is a huge oversight in the manufacturing of these discs.  The discs are double sided and they failed to identify which side is Side A and which side is Side B.  When they come new, Side A is facing up.  But if you don't put them back in the same way, you'll need to actually put the disc into the player and pull up the episode index before you'll know whether you have the correct side or need to remove the disc and turn it over.  I have looked very carefully and there is NO indication of Side A or B on any of my discs.  Perhaps they corrected the problem part way through manufacturing, but I can assure you there is nothing on my discs to tell.

Anyway, that is my only beef.  The ER series is top notch and I think most of us are familiar with it or we wouldn't be considering buying this.  I give it four stars only because of the manufacturing issue.",1119312000,19,865,4.076923076923077
1470090,3,B00005JLFT,"Although I'm SUPER-grounded because of my CRAZY weekend, my dad really gets along with my friend Lyle (he works at the same car-company as Lyle's dad and THEY are friends), so he lets him come over, which is cool, because I'm on total lock-down now.

Lyle came over Tuesday night, happier than I've seen him in a while. He's been quite down since Hockey died (it used to be his favorite show, as it was for all Canadians). Well, he's been going on about this show called ""ER"" for a while now, saying it's the best show on TV, and it finally came out for DVD. I never watched it when it was on, because, well to be short, it was a comedy/drama. When you have ""Digital"" cable there is always a good action-movie on. A few weeks ago, I was flippin' through the channels, and Rumble in the Bronx was on. I believe that was it's name, well I ended up watching that for a while but ended up turning it off because the voice-dubbing was messed up and started to drive me crazy, and also the lead actor could not act at all (you kind of need to act in order to be an actor, buddy). Now THAT was a frustrating situation. I'll tell you about it someday.

Anyways, we watched about five episodes of ER before dad kicked us out of the living room to watch the Pistons game, but that was enough for me to get the gist of the show. It follows a young ""intern"", I guess he's not a real doctor yet, so he's probably on the same level as Dr. Bertrand. Anywho, the show starts off with his first day, and follows him as he adjusts to the new atmosphere, learns new techniques, practices said techniques, and things of that nature. To be honest, the show actually gave me a new respect for doctors. I always just knew the whole save-people's-lives aspect, I never knew that they played dress-up or surfed on the wheeled bed things.

The greatest thing about this show is that it inspired me that when Morris (my dog) dies, I'm going to have him stuffed and keep him in my room, forever. That way I will always have a wrestling buddy. So as far as the star-count goes, starting at five (5) stars, I will deduct four (4) stars, for it not having any action in the show what-so-ever, but I will give two (2) stars for inspiring me to stuff Morris. In conclusion, don't believe what you see in the emergency-room, a little known fact is that all doctors are, are very educated and over-paid clowns. Later.

1470091,5,B00005JLFT,"But a really good show!

I can't say it was the gore, the drama, or the fact that I too was working in an ""ER"" but I started watching the show religiously during its airings from 9 to 11 on TNT. I used to work up at a level 1 trauma center in Chicago as an ED technician. I would work at night and thus have the mornings free to vegetate. I have been able to follow the show from the first season to what I believe is the sixth season (TNT cycles the episodes after it ends).

I'll give you what I believe is the main reason why I am hooked to the show and then go on to bash what I think the show misportrays but what it ultimately inspires. Main reason- The show is about real characters. Drama, medical technical details aside, you get to heart of what makes ER a compelling medidrama- people with real issues, real flaws that work so tirelessly to help others. You feel for Nurse Hathaway or Dr. Greene. They aren't as one dimensional or as stereotypical as a sitcom character. You can identify with them as a protoganist but at the same time, dwell and anguish over their decisions and choices on the show.

Some of the problems I have with the show are that of what makes the show compelling. A lot of medicine is not as engaging or as clear-cut as ER may make it seem. You see Doug, Carol, Mark, Benton work so tirelessy to help others. They're committed, dedicated, and passionate about their work. As a tech, working in a real ED, I found this lacking with a lot of residents and attendings. The reality is medicine at times has very few rewards, very few emotional peaks and ebs as ER would make you seem. There are very few thank yous, very few heart-agonizing moments. Sometimes, towards the end of a 12 hour shift, you feel numb to the work you've done.

This is all to say I don't love what I do and what I'm going to get into (going to start med school this July). It's just ER is to medicine like Apprentice is to corporate business. The show's way too idealistic, overdramatic. But the point of a good show is not for it to be realistic which brings me in full circle to the main reason.

A good show allows you to identify with its main characters, like Carol, Doug, Jeanie because they embody such heroic characteristics that you would want in yourself. The main characters are what you want out of doctors, PAs, nurses working in an ER. I wished doctors could all be a little more like Dr. Benton or Dr. Greene. I wish I too could work in a place like County Hospital, maybe starting as a lowly tech, working my way up the ladders. But that would be too unrealistic, idealistic of me.",1116201600,8,2604,4.273833671399594

1470193,5,B00005JLFT,"""E.R."" follows the personal and professional lives of the emergency room staff of a large Chicago hospital.  Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) is the compassionate chief intern whose marriage is just barely holding together.  Doug Ross (George Clooney) is a womanizing, self-loathing pediatrician whose on-again-off-again relationship with nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) was a long-standing source of sexual tension.  Peter Benton (Eriq Lasalle) is a brilliant surgeon, though arrogant and impatient.  Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) is a good doctor who is burdened with a psychotic family.  John Carter (Noah Wyle) is a medical student in the first year of his residency, and one of the pleasures of this season is watching him develop from barely being able to stitch a wound to showing clear promise of becoming an excellent doctor.  The combination of strong ensemble acting and fine writing makes for superior TV drama that has proven to be both enduring and adaptable.  Eleven years after its debut, it's still going strong even though virtually none of the original cast remains.  There are many strong episodes here, but the Emmy-winning ""Love's Labor Lost,"" in which Dr. Greene fights to save a pregnancy gone horribly wrong, deserves special mention./",1107648000,2,1270,5.411167512690355

No mention of quality of transfer, sound quality, etc, just negativities concerning the double sided discs.  I'm literally in disbelief that people are that inept, or they blame the disc b/c they own a silly DVD jukebox player incapable of flipping discs.  Hmmm...which one was the incorrect purchase I wonder.
  Nobody seems to mention that although original shown on TV in 4:3 full screen, this first season has been released in true 16x9 format.  Later seasons were/are shown in letterboxed format for all you analog TV watchers, but for those in the know, we watch ER in breathtaking HDTV 16x9 now with no black bars.  I greatly appreciate that the first season, originally shown for everyone in full screen format, have been released for us in widescreen format, the same as later seasons.
  In this respect, they really got it right.  4.5 stars only b/c more extras could always be added.  As for those upset b/c they need to, gasp, use their legs and fingers to flip the disc, shame on you.  Next time, for full lazy effect, buy a DVD player that flips your DVDs for you and stop complaining.  I mean, it's not like you have to flip the disc in the middle of an episode or anything.
 Oh and by the way, no they didn't just put black bars on the top and bottom of the picture like someone suggested cutting off the picture.  The widescreen anamorphic is the original way it was shot, they cut off the sides for the original tv presentation.  In other words, you are seeing parts of these episodes never before seen.  In fact, no black bars at all.  Anamorphic means they squeeze the widescreen down so all the content in viewable on a 4:3 tv.  On a widescreen tv, the picture doesnt look squeezed, but the content if the same for both 4:3 tvs and 16:9 tvs.  Obviously it doesn't really look right on the 4:3 tvs though.

1470197,5,B00005JLFT,"This show is not intended to satisfy everybody. It is designed more for intellectual people, especially for those interested in Health Sciences. It is defenetely NOT designed for the average human who only wants to see blood, blasphemy, gore, violence and others as such, in order to escape the brutal reality in which we all live in. Before you put a comment in which you criticise the fact that they show so much death, sadness and ""disfunctionality"" you should stop a little to think about the society we live in; there are wars and traumas and human suffering everywhere and so often we come across a case in which someone was killed or commited suicide that we often become so tuned out and when a TV show like ER presents us the reality it bothers us..

  Some reviews say that it is very unrealistic because there is too much work, there is too much suffering and too many problems in the doctors' lives. Well whether one accepts it or not, that is the real truth; first, doctors are all human beings and as every human being on this planet they are not perfect. Second, it is extremely hard to become a doctor in the first place. I spoke to med students: they sleep at most 4 hours per night and you have to learn an enormous amount of material each week. You don't become a doctor just for the sake of it, you become a doctor because you want to, because you want to dedicate your life to the people around you, especially in these times when there is so much chaos going on in every corner of this planet. I was told by doctors the same thing and this tv show puts it more clearly than anybody else: you can become a great doctor only if you want to sacrifice your life to the others, only if helping people is your deepest and strongest desire you have. And the fact that the lives of the doctors are so troubled, shows even more what i've just said: in order to achieve this goal you have to put aside your personal life when you are in the hospital and this creates big problems in one's personal life.

  This tv show is dedicated to the doctors and their efforts they put in order to save our lives. The characters are great and every one plays a very realistic role. Note that there are a lot of medical terms involved, since this is what happens in a real hospital; you don't hear ""Put this stuff into this guy's vein, and then crack his chest open 'cause you have to apply some drugs directly ito his heart.."", that would be very silly and it would very much degrade the high degree of realism this tv series offers us. Welcome to the world of medicine folks!

  I highly recommend this tv series (every season actually) to everybody interested in seeing what is going on in a real emergency hospital. If you are interested in working as a doctor or a nurse in such an emergency hospital and wonder what degree of stress you would face each day, ER is the best place to start looking for answers. It might even make you even more interested in becoming a doctor! Again, this is the best TV series of this kind out there.",1098144000,,3038,4.353356890459364

All of these personalities mixed into one show makes watching ER: The Complete First Season a very enjoyable experience.
  My Favorite episode from season one would have to be The Pilot. Even though it isn't taken as an ""episode"" I really enjoyed it because, again, the characters are introduced and they're personalities are introduced.

All of the characters in this program are extremely likeable and a pleasure to watch on screen in each and every frantically-paced scene.  The acting is truly inspiring. Just fabulous. By ALL of them.
I'm glad these shows are presented in the Widescreen format on this DVD set. Widescreen suits this series nicely (IMO).  And the video quality is very good.  As is the sound.  I had a minor ""glitch""/""freeze-up"" problem with one episode on Disc #2, which caused me to skip over a chapter. But other than that snafu (which has been reported by others as well), these discs have performed their duties admirably.
The Special Features are fun here as well.  There's an ample amount of stuff to delve into here, including multiple featurettes and audio commentaries, plus additional (unaired) scenes.  There's also a very funny outtakes/blooper reel (10 minutes) included. Anthony Edwards' ""That explains the hat"" ad-libbed remark after blowing a line is a standout from the blooper reel. :-)
Be prepared to become totally immersed in the ""ER"" experience when you sit down to watch these DVDs.  As I watch this group of actors doing their thing in their familiar environs of the Emergency Room, they truly ""become"" an ""ER team"" for those 45 minutes. They don't seem like actors at all. They are *really* saving lives in the ER. It's *that* realistic.

This show started in 94 and was not filmed in widescreen (Not as far as I know anyway) so the only thing that that can mean is some idiots just gone and stuck two black lines on the top and bottom of the screen, covering up a percentage of the picture and calling it widescreen. I don't see any other way of doing it.
Anyway aside from that it's still e.r, and when its e.r it doesn't matter if some idiots cut off half the sound and the picture. You still watch it, and if you cant, then you buy it instead.

While I will give kudos for the Special Features I have been disturbed by the presentation of the shows. Many of the episodes show very distinct signs of wear and tear. Many scratches and such which should of been taken care of before committing them to disc.
I know a lot of people won't notice this (my girlfriend didn't until I pointed it out to her) for those of us who expect their DVD presentations to be immaculate, this series is a big let down. A lot of people have complained about the fact that the discs are flippers (a few episodes on each side of the disc). This doesn't really bother me as I'm always careful when handling discs and no episode is interupted to turn the disc over, as was the case with early flipper DVD's of movies.
So overall I would say if you love E.R and scratchy presentation doesn't bother you, this set is a must buy.

I find the pace of the show exhilirating and I'm impressed with the close attention to detail of the clinical cases.  They are a medical students dream for learning medicine.",1065916800,10,584,5.247311827956989

1470331,5,B00005JLFT,"I have to admit the first 2 episodes didn't do anything for me.  The third I recognized what makes me love this fictional, fast paced drama! George Clooney,Anthony Edwards, Eriq LaSalle,Julianna Marguilles, Sherry Stringfield, Noah Wylie all make this show so watchable. I do realize that the show has made a lot of changes since it's beginnings but it is still great! I think this show is a definate best buy of 2003. The episodes are all interesting and have there own magic to them and and strong and realistic stories as well that can almost make you think the people are perhaps someone you know or might have known in your life at some point. A Great! buy and definetly worth your time! I do hope the rest of the series comes along on dvd as well SOON!",1065312000,,758,4.453237410071942
1470332,5,B00005JLFT,"I already have every episode of  ""E.R."" on video, taped from television ( Channel Four, England ), but imagine my glee when it was announced that the first season was going to be released on DVD?! For my money, along with ""Hill Street Blues"", this show for the past nine years has produced some of the most exhilirating, thought-provoking, scary, funny and heart-warming moments seen on television. Who can forget ""Love's Labour Lost"", ""The Healers"", ""Random Acts"" and more recently ""Lockdown"", ""Chaos Theory"" ( I won't be looking at helicopters in the same way again! ) and the 200th episode ""When Night Meets Day"" ( at one point using split-screens as an exciting storytelling device ).
It's always a worry when production / distribution companies don't give ground-breaking cinema and television due care and attention when assembling DVD sets such as these, so I was glad when I saw a fairly extensive, but quality-rich, extras list to be included alongside the episodes themselves. The documentaries are very good, showing the origins of ""E.R."", from it's inception as a 70's film script to it's development as a T.V. series in the mid-90's ( One can only imagine how heart-stopping ""E.R."" would have been if directed by as a film by Steven Spielberg. Instead he went on to direct ""Jurassic Park"" ). The commentaries are good as well, although I felt that ""Love's Labour Lost"" was slightly sidetracked by a bit too much self-congratulatory, back-slapping ( deserved by the eventual quality of the end product, but I know how good the episode was - tell me more of how and why you did it! ).
My biggest gripe with the set appears to be the quality of the transfers of the episodes. For me it's a bit distracting to be watching a `pristine' digital presentation of a film or T.V. series, only to see what appears to be `print damage' on screen. As this could, in some quarters, be seen as a potential archive of this show, it would have been nice if the obvious care for ""E.R."" had been extended to this aspect.
Overall, a five-star presentation for a five-star series. It bodes well for the ( assumed! ) release of the next eight series of what  for me ( along with ""24"" ) is `must see' television.",1063929600,4,2202,4.68733850129199
1470422,3,B00005JLFT,"Two things:
a) ER is an excellent show, and the Season 1 set catches it at its earliest and (perhaps) most brilliant. The ensemble cast gels immediately, the writing is impeccable, the storylines compelling. You really can't do much better.
b) Some of the extras are stupendous. The behind-the-scenes documentaries, while presented in the interrupt-speech-with-video-clip-that-vaguely-relates-to-what-the-person-is-saying format I'm not too fond of, are very, very enlightening. I always wondered how much the instant success of the series impacted how easy it was to film on location, and I got my answer. The blooper reel is an expanded version of what we've seen before, and is very nice.
That said:
ER's first season has, believe it or not, actually been available for quite some time. The caveat: it was only available as an expensive Japanese set, and as our Benevolent Guardians the MPAA would have it, you of course needed an all-region player to play these discs if not in Japan. That said, having seen the first few seasons in that format a few times, I was blown away. The colors were vivid, and while the extras were bare to nonexistent, I was quite pleased with the presentation.
I am not similarly pleased with this domestic set. Firstly, the set is matted into widescreen. We've heard proponents of letterboxing whine (quite justifiably, of course) for absolute years about how pan-and-scan versions of feature films are an absolute abomination. I'd like someone to explain, then, why it's suddenly an acceptable practice to chop the top and bottom off of a TV program to make it look better on widescreen TVs? ERs first few seasons presumably weren't filmed in widescreen, as we're definitely getting less information in certain shots. I'd at least have liked a choice.
Additionally, the picture quality isn't quite up to snuff. In particular, there's TONS of visual garbage in certain scenes (and no, it isn't just my set...I've seen it on other people's). Check ""Blizzard"" right when Carol is taking the emergency phone in...there's a shot of Haleh which has a hilarious amount of white splotches flickering across it. Other scenes in other episodes are similarly plagued with what could either be dirt on the print or digital glitches, and several scenes seem oddly washed-out. This would be acceptable on a feature film from 30 years ago, but why here? Especially when the Japanese sets generally didn't have these problems? (needless to say, I hope these weren't caused during the matting transfer).
If you've never seen ER before, run run run and get this set. It's far cheaper than most equivalent sets, and well worth the $45 price. If, however, you either own the Japanese set or suspect that better things might come to those who wait...well, you might be better off waiting. I love the episodes, and love the extras, but the suspect picture quality and forced-widescreening (we don't see this being done to the freakin' Simpsons!) take a few points off this set.",1063238400,6,2989,5.040404040404041
1470423,5,B00005JLFT,"I heard a lot of good things about ER, but I haven't had any chance to watch it.  After renting the first Disc. from NetFlix and watching the pilot, I couldn't stop watching the whole DVD.  I will not rent the second DVD, but I surely will buy the complete seasons.",1063238400,2,265,4.176470588235294
1470424,5,B00005JLFT,"Finally, Season One has arrived on DVD!  If you are familiar with ER you know all the adjectives used to describe this unique show; Gripping, Stunning, Amazing, etc.
So what does this DVD offer?  Well, as the title states, the complete first season.  It also includes the 1 1/2 hour pilot.  In addition there are behind the scenes, bloopers, the making of, commentaries on three episodes, and more.
As a real fan of ER I have waited for this DVD for some time now.  The shows are wonderful to revisit.  I am reminded of 'old friends' who have long since left the ER.
I gave up on TV a number of years ago and do not have cable or watch any TV.  A family member records the current ER episodes for me and I devour them each time.  It is simply outstanding entertainment.  The actors, story, music, editing, camera work and sooo much more combine to bring out the very best in entertainment.
The only downside to this DVD comes with the packaging.  The DVDs are double sided so you cannot set the DVD down without possibly scratching it.  Also, because there is no label on each DVD you need to read the very fine print near the center hole to identify which DVD is # 1, 2, 3, or 4.  And the print is even smaller to figure out which side is A/B.
My 5 star rating is based on the quality of the episodes.  The extras included with the DVD deserve 4 stars, and the packaging would be only 1 star.",1062892800,61,1393,4.250950570342205
1470425,5,B00005JLFT,"Great show, Great first season and worth buying.  The only downside is that it comes with 4 ""flip disc"" which makes it hard to keep from scratching or damaging(especially with the packaging).  I would've been willing to pay a little extra if they just put all the episodes on 1 side of I would assume 6 disc(instead of 4 flip disc).  To make it more annoying, each disc does NOT tell you which side is ""A"" and which side is ""B"" that would helped a little.  I hope they fix these annoyances on future ER DVDs.",1062720000,6,508,4.260416666666667

There are other various commentaries throughout the set.  I would recommend this set as a gift or as a gift to yourself.  The discs are double-sided and the packaging is pretty amazing.

As an avid reader, and more recently a nursing student, I've always understood the jargon, which made the show a lot easier to follow than it otherwise would have been, but this past year working as a nurse's aide on a cancer ward drove home just how realistic this show truly is.  Posted on a bulletin board at work one day was a list titled ""You know you're a nurse when..."" that included ""...you can't watch ER because it's too much like real life.""  And that's the simple truth.  Every emergency room in every hospital obviously isn't always as hectic and dramatic as this show, but many are, and all are at one time or another.  And, taken collectively, true-to-life stories hospital-wide are accurately portrayed, but in the context of an ER so that they can easily be told in the short period of a one hour drama.  Being an evening worker on and off over the years, I've missed far too many episodes of this incredible, heartrending, heartwarming show. I welcome this opportunity to buy the entire first season, and I look forward to more seasons being made available.

1470524,5,B00005JLFT,Wow incredible the first season of ER is finally coming to DVD with all of the special features that will be incredible to see.  The episode entitled Love Labors Lost is a very heartfelt episode. To me the fact that you have a great episode just focusing on one doctor trying his best to deliver a baby and is unsuccessful delivering and doing the surgery and saving the baby.  Then losing the mother in the end that was the saddest part of the episode.  Another episode is The Gift that ended the first half of the season is really good but is also sad in the fact that they had a patient coming in with brain damage and is brain dead.  They came in to harvest his organs and she did not want to have them harvest his organs.  But anyways the first season of ER was awesome because the fact that they won over Chicago Hope the first season was very good and they have been on ever since.  Chicago Hope was the only hospital show to get cancelled and not be shown again because the fact it kind of stunk were as ER every week they had a new and exciting episode and they brought in new cast member.  This year they brought back and original cast member Sherry Stringfield to reprise her role as Doctor Susan Lewis.  That was a very good move for NBC to bring her back because she and Anthony Edwards were the only two cast members to be on their for a while till Anthony Edwards character of Doctor Mark Greene was killed off in 2002 of brain cancer.  This is a must have collecters edition DVD for anyone go buy it because they will be flying off the shelves in the ladder part of August.,1059609600,5,1589,4.217821782178218

Anthony Edwards, George Clooney, Julianna Margulies, Noah Wyle, Sherry Stringfield, and Eriq La Salle starred in season one.  It explores many issues besides medicine: depression, suicide, sexual obsession, anxiety, etc.  The intensity the writers present keeps the audience's eyes wide open waiting to discover what happens next.

1470630,5,B00005JLFT,"Good things really do come to those who wait! Rejoice as the release of ER: The Complete First Season DVD launches what no doubt will be the first of a string of additional season boxed sets. For almost ten years now, critics and audiences have debated over what hooks them to the show more - the realistic trama cases and procedures or the drama surrounding the personal lives of the staff of County General? Thankfully and wisely, the producers devote equal screen time on both the tramas and the drama making each that much richer.
With all episodes in original running order and commercial-free (always an appeal to buy boxed sets) prepare to sit back and let tv's ""top docs"" (as TV Guide declared them back in the day) pull you into the Emergency Room (or Emergency Department, as medical professionals have stated would be more accurate). Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), the heart and soul of the ER; Dr. Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield), good-hearted colleague of Greene's whom could be, should be more than a friend; Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney), a complex womanizer, yet THE doc you'd want working on your child's case; Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies), a suicidal nurse who quickly becomes an integral character; Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), emotionally devoid, yet gifted surgeon; Med student John Carter, Benton's eager-beaver intern always angling for the best route to becoming a good doctor. And let's not exclude the many supporting actors portraying the nurses, who really keep the hospital running as they remind the docs and us throughout the episodes.
They're all here on DVD to remind us how the monster hit series began...with PLENTY of extras to satisfy every fan and critic of the show. We might even get to see how the principals learn all that medical jargon or even better, see the actors flubbing the difficult diction.
 It's always wild to go back in time and watch a currently running show during it's early years. Comparing the look and characterizations of the cast from then to now as you notice how most characters weren't quite fleshed out. Compare Dr. Benton in the pilot to Benton from the episodes then on, and you'll see exactly what I mean.

1470701,5,B00005JLFT,"Other than the news, I have never really been interested in television shows of any kind.  However, one evening while sick in bed, I turned on the television and ER was on.  I watched an episode called ""All In The Family"", and anyone who has seen that episode knows of the tragedy that took place. It was so well presented and acted, that I soon found myself in tears.  I have not missed another episode since.  It is an excellent show which accurately depicts what can happen in any emergency room and I am very anxious to add every episode of ER to my DVD collection.",1046649600,,569,4.339622641509434
1470702,5,B00005JLFT,"ER is such a technically accurate show that when it first came out my medical school sponsored ""ER"" parties at the school lounge every Thursday night.  Whenever Carter the medical student was pimped a question by his resident or attending students would yell out the answer to see who would get it right.  It was great review especially before exam week.  Although it's gotten more dramatic & less technical in recent seasons, there's still a few rare ""classic cases"" with ""classic signs & symptoms"" that students don't get to see much on the real floors (Wilson's Disease & Trisomy 18 were recent examples on the show).  They should make an ER DVD with a quiz or game component, where they play a scene in the episode where a patient presents w/ signs & symptoms & just before the doctor says what they have & how it should be treated, a multiple choice screen pops up asking ""what's the diagnosis"" or ""what's the next step in management doc?""  Then, have the scene play out after they give their answer with information on the disease in closed caption at the bottom.  It would be fun for doctors & educate the public.",1045872000,33,1120,4.603015075376884
1470703,5,B00005JLFT,"Well I have to admit that I haven't watched this show all nine years.  I started in the sixth year being a casual watcher, but two years ago I got Mono and last year I got my Sinius Scraped.  Each time I missed a Semester of school.  What got me back on my feet, and what made me go on was watching The reruns of this show on TNT and the Buffy reruns.  It is such a downright shame that this show isn't on DVD, Its one of the best things that ever aired.  Please release this on DVD, you would please so many people.  Anyway, with most shows the first isn't the best but it's key to the plot.  The best season is the Third and Fourth.  We can all hope they will come out in due time.",1042329600,9,683,3.8633093525179856
1470704,5,B00005JLFT,"In my opinion, this is one of the best shows on tv. The excitement, drama and non-stop pace make it the greatest.  I missed the first season, thinking it was just another ""guts and gore"" show.  After seeing one episode in season 2, I was interested and after 2 more, I was hooked.  I would love for it to be put on DVD.  Not just 1 or 2 episodes, but the full season.  It would be worth it.  ER is excellant.",1042329600,16,408,3.9753086419753085

7939543,5,B00005JLFT,The series is based on Cook County Hospital in Chicago where I spent 7 years training. I didn't watch it until recently and was shocked how true to life they portrayed the hospital. Not candy coated like other doctor shows. It was before its time in the topics they tackled,1522368000,,273,4.48
