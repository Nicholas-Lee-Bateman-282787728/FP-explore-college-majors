886294,4,630446648X,It was a pleasure to once to see an old favourite after a gap of many years. It was the age of clean cut comedy for all ages and with a lesson built in.,1320969600,3,152,3.5

886296,4,630446648X,"Jonathan Winters, Bob Hope, Jill St. John, Phyllis Diller, and Shirley Eaton, not to mention a couple of brief appearances by well known character actors of the Sixties, all rolled into one amusing romp!  This may not be the funniest movie Bob Hope ever made, but if you love the above actors as I do, you will still enjoy it.  Having never seen or heard of this one, I took a chance on the MGM ""DVD-R"" and found the quality better than I expected.  The aspect ratio seems correct (I had just finished watching two Blu ray movies which were definitely correct ratio, and this appeared correct without excess stretching or compression), the colors are fairly vivid, and resolution is good.  There are no extras, and sadly no subtitles, but I would recommend this title anyway, because the actors' expressions are nearly good enough to see without language!  Given the lack of extras or subtitles I think the price should be under $15.  If you can find it near this price I would recommend a purchase, otherwise I would recommend a rental.",1275436800,20,1037,4.670329670329671
886297,4,630446648X,"A classic comedy starring Bob Hope, Phyllis Diller, and Johathan Winters. This movie runs 1hr 47 mins and originally came out in 1967. This videocassette was released in 1997 by MGM/UA. The story is about a single-dad bank teller who happens to find $10,000 in a supermarket parking lot. He then gets accused of embezzling $50,000 from his bank.

All manner of zaniness erupts as this dad goes on the lam with his 7 kids. I really enjoyed seeing real scenes of areas around Los Angeles and various neighborhoods in the late 60's. The bright colors, clothing style, furnitures, cars, etc, really capture a flavor of the times. Some of the humor is mildly suggestive, which I like. Overall the movie is very silly in a late 60's kinda way but charming at the same time.",1254182400,6,767,4.639705882352941
886461,4,630446648X,A lot of funny one liners. You need to be familiar with Bob Hope in order to understand many of the jokes.,1474761600,,106,3.8636363636363638

886468,5,630446648X,"For a silly '60s movie, this is very enjoyable.  The plot revolves around a widowed father of seven (Bob Hope) on the run with his clan after he is accused of embezzlement.  What makes this title stand out is the guest stars - the great Jonathan Winters and Phyllis Diller in particular.  Diller plays her typical messy character and Winters is a hoot as a dumb policeman (and, briefly, as his Maude Frickert character).  Jill St. John, Shirley Eaton, and character actor Charles Lane are also featured.  While I'm happy that this is on DVD at all, it is a completely bare-bones release.  There are no menus or extras at all and even the synopsis on the back is minimal.",1457654400,,670,4.541666666666667

886685,5,630446648X,"Clean enough for the kids to watch.  By today's standards this is down right wholesome.  Yet is still contains that 1960s high brow spice.

We are Bob Hope fans so this is just another movie in our collection.  We will watch it once a year or so.",1400198400,2,246,4.170212765957447
886686,5,630446648X,This is a funny Bob Hope movie that is very entertaining to watch.  This kind of movie (true G rating) will never be made again.  Beware that is issued on a DVD-R that makes me darn discussed.  All movies should be issued on a regular DVD.,1396396800,,239,4.1521739130434785

886788,5,630446648X,"You will not be disappointed in this farce !  What a classic movie to own !  Watch for a mistake in the chase scene.  Here is the set-up:  Jonathan Winters  are in a blue car chasing Bob Hope.  Phyllis Diller sticks her head out the window to attempt shooting tires out on the car that Hope is driving.  Instead,  a  freak thing happens and the bullet ricochets;  and blows out the tire of the blue car which they are driving instead.  After they pull over,  watch the people walking on the sidewalk in the background.  The are walking by,  and turn to walk around the side of the building.  A  few seconds later,  they walk around it again.  The continuity person goofed up !  These old comedys  will lift your spirit do a time when things were a little less stressful in life !",1388448000,,779,4.277777777777778
886789,5,630446648X,"Eight On The Lam is a lot of laughs. Luckily I got to see this in the theatre. Phyllis Diller makes the show as the wild housekeeper. Once again Bob Hope offers good support. This is almost a sequel to Boy Did I Get A Wrong number, which was their hit a year before. You can watch this with anybody.",1386633600,,299,4.0

886792,5,630446648X,"Here's another Bob Hope/Phyllis Diller collaboration from the Sixties that still bodes well for 21st century Bob Hope completists.  Now if they would get ""Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number"" back in DVD circulation, that would complete the collections of many Bob Hope collectors.  ""Eight On The Lam"" also features the late Jonathan Winters in another funny role.",1369872000,,358,5.0508474576271185
886793,5,630446648X,Can't beat the classics like this. Includes a great lineup of hilarious cast. A must see for the fan of good ol' clean humor.,1364169600,2,125,4.25
886794,5,630446648X,"This is a light and fun film that feels refreshing, rather than dated.  It's like a communication from a simpler world, when entertainment was less frantically paced and humor was gentler.  This was the first Bob Hope film I ever saw, and it made me go and explore more of his comedies.  If you enjoy this, I'd recommend ""Boy Did I Get A Wrong Number"" and ""I'll Take Sweden"", which have a similar comedic tone.",1360972800,4,410,4.44

I don't know what to say except people would have to watch it on their own and see what they think!! It was good though!",1349308800,2,360,3.8783783783783785

7872491,3,630446648X,Corny and not particularly logical comedy. Jonathan Winters and Phyllis Diller (Who looks to be dressed in her pajamas during most scenes) save the film because the parts with Hope and his family fall flat for the most part. The slapstick chase finale- a staple of film comedies for a long time- is way too long but it does give new meaning to the golf term buried in the sand.,1512432000,,377,4.4
