4854395,3,B005ORVN00,"The DVD under review introduces viewers to the adventures of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  The documentary ""Quest for King Arthur"" of 2004 is by far the best in this series.  Viewers will realize that defining Arthur and his life is particularly challenging due to the sparse historical information that exists about him.  Furthermore, Arthurian authors such as Geoffrey of Monmouth, Chrtien de Troyes, and Thomas Malory each have their respective version of the characters, events, and themes of the Arthurian legend.  Therefore, historians still struggle to separate fact from fiction on this subject.  In summary, this DVD set does a good job of debating the historicity of King Arthur and his Knights.",1328486400,34,724,5.153846153846154

Almost all of us know at least part of the story of King Arthur.
The legendary British leader is said to have made a major impact on history around 500 a.d. It's said the knight never lost a battle unless you count Sir Lancelot stealing his bride, Guinevere. It's said that infedelity led to the fall of the Round Table and Camelot.
The History Channel has released King Arthur and Medieval Britain explores the controversay of if King Arthur was a real person, or if the story is based more on myth than fact.
After all, it's known the Round Table  was first described in 1155 by Wace, who got his information from past legends.
The castle (Camelot) is mentioned for the first time in Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes' poem Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, dating to the 1170s, though it does not appear in all the manuscripts.
In fact, Geoffrey of Monmouth's list of kings of the Britons, published around the 12th century, is one of the first time's we find the name -- King Arthur.
The problem is plenty of British royals have used King Arthur as an ideal, a ""person"" for all Brits to trace their brave and historic beginnings to.
Many historians suggest that Arthur has no historical basis. That the stories are pure myth. Others think that there might not have been a King Arthur, but that the character has basis in fact.
Yet, there is little doubt that many Britains chose the name Arthur when naming a male baby.
We may never know the answer but King Arthur is definitely worth a watch and a lot of fun.",1327449600,24,1563,4.519434628975265

4854398,5,B005ORVN00,I love history and this piece of history is an addition to my library that I am glad to have.  It is easy to follow and full of details that I was not aware.,1401408000,,157,3.6176470588235294

4854400,5,B005ORVN00,Interesting story line and perspective of who King Arthur could be...entertaining to watch. Enjoyed great actors in this movie. The extra's are also worth watching.,1390608000,,164,5.6
4854401,1,B005ORVN00,"I checked this out for my kids who are reading Howard Pyle's King Arthur (for kids).  I assumed, based on the title of the DVD set, that maybe we would learn something about, oh, say, King Arthur.  Maybe something about Medieval Britain.  What we learned about was Lancelot and Guinevere.  The historians who were interviewed were trying to prove their intense passion as fact.  So I thought maybe we'll sit this sex stuff out and get to some more facts about Celts, Medieval Britain, who was Arthur, etc, but no, just more Lancelot and Guinevere.

I skipped to different episodes and was shocked that they could work this love affair into the main focus of every episode.  Finally, skipping to the episode about the Holy Grail, I thought maybe we could be free of the sex talk... Guinevere didn't search for the Holy Grail, after all.  Oh, but the sexiest was yet to come!  The grail, after all, was not the cup Jesus drank from at the last supper.  No, forget about the fact that Medieval people were very interested in relics from the time of Jesus.  Forget that they believed such relics had miraculous powers.  History Channel went and found some new historians who are bored with these facts and have become intrigued with Dan Brown and the Knights Templar, oooh much more sexy than an old broken cup.

My kids learned nothing about history.  They learned that our modern culture can find nothing more glorious than sex.  A good lesson for a couple of preteens, surely.",1380499200,6,1475,4.662790697674419
4854402,4,B005ORVN00,"Five different shows (on two DVDs) made independently from each other give a good look at this subject.  If you have any interest, this is a good collection.",1358294400,,157,4.607142857142857
4854403,5,B005ORVN00,"I originally ordered this collection of videos because I was searching for a program which I had ""surfed through"" some time back.  It was a program about the Arthurian legends narrated by Leonard Nimoy.  Well, that program is on in this collection along with two other even better programs.  The best and most recent (2004) is narrated by Patrick Stewart and runs over an hour.  Additionally, there are two more programs; one about knights, their armor and weapons (approx. 90 minutes) which is excellent and also a program about the Holy Grail legends, also excellent.
I'm very happy with this collection with a total run time of about 5 and a half hours.  For sure, there is more to the Arthurian legends, but these videos will get anyone well up on the learning curve regarding all the basics and more.",1354492800,10,805,4.7214285714285715
4854404,1,B005ORVN00,"The historical speculation and complete disregard for truth make this fantasy dangerous to youthful viewers.

4854405,5,B005ORVN00,"I was going to list the titles on the DVD but they are already listed in the above description.  There are many questions about the real King Arthur (or whether there ever was one).  This DVD- or any of the Arthur DVDs -will have whatever information is available to us at the present.  Historians are continually trying to sift through the facts for a better handle on the subject, but  what is known still leaves us uncertain as to his origin or the actual origins of the stories.  Later tales added more facts and characters but this DVD tries to fill us in on what is known from the 6th century onward and also gives a little background on the writers of the stories.  The disc also contains a section on Arms and Armor and visits the collection in Graz, Austria.",1339113600,14,767,4.404255319148936

8481742,4,B005ORVN00,"There are 3 separate shows on this DVD. There is a lot of interesting information regarding the King Arthur legend, and the possible locations of Camelot. Of course the debate goes on, on whether King Arthur is true; a myth; or a composite of several people who lived at that time.
There are NO subtitles on this DVD set - hence the 4 stars - (I don't know about closed captioned - I don't have that capability on my TV). And you can pick different chapters on each show or play all.  Because there are no subtitles, I know I missed information. Some of the people interviewed are from England & I have a little trouble with the accents sometimes. Obviously I will watch these again, as there is also a lot of information to absorb. I think this is a better set since there are 3 shows on the one DVD.",1421798400,,801,4.269736842105263
