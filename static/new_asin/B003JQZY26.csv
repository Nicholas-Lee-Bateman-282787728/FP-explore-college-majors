8398420,5,B003JQZY26,"I saw this originally when it first premiered on LMN & really liked it.  Several years later I stumbled upon it on Amazon & bought it.  I think it has been edited & shortened since the original, but not so much that it hurt the story.  It is such an unusual story, particularly for network TV.  But  that is why I like it. Good special effects too.",1484611200,,348,4.134328358208955
