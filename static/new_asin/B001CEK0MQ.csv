3511849,5,B001CEK0MQ,My 2 yr grandson really loves this show. He sits in the chair and watches it all the way through. He knows all the characters and story lines. This week his mom spelled out to his dad 'go put T-e-c on in the b-e-d-r-o-o-m' and my grandson immediately got up and said he would watch Tec in the bedroom! I am amazed by how little ones respond to this show! Please give us more!!,1318464000,,376,4.094594594594595
3511850,4,B001CEK0MQ,"TEC gets FIVE stars, but unfortunately the meager number of episodes forces me to a final assessment of less than five stars.

TEC is a gentle, quiet, but extremely attention-grabbing and educational program.  My children LOVE it, and it doesn't hype them up or make them grouchy like some PBS kids shows do.  I even enjoy it!

The only reason I didn't give the product itself 5 stars is because for the price you should really get about 6 episodes at least, as each episode is really quite brief.",1295049600,6,497,4.550561797752809
3511851,5,B001CEK0MQ,"Tec is my son's favorite show. My husband and I like it almost as well as he does! This is a wonderful learning show, especially for children who love animals. I wish I could find more Tec accessories since my son loves him so much.",1285891200,6,232,4.177777777777778
3511852,3,B001CEK0MQ,I love Tec the Tractor. I hope my son will grow up to love it too. I give the show itself 5 stars. but the DVD I only give three becuase there are only three episodes. Way too short for the money.,1285113600,15,196,3.6904761904761907
3511853,5,B001CEK0MQ,"Tec the tractor is a wonderful little show.  The setting in a rural area makes for beautiful scenery and a realistic glimpse into farm life.  The narration is simple yet not condescending to children (or the adults watching with them).  We all really love watching Tec together, especially right before bedtime as it is not raucous; the music is quite soothing and the content does not inspire excitement.  There is always something new to learn about behavior, cause and effect, working diligently, telling the truth, respecting others and their property, problem solving, etc.  It is money well spent.  We had the BabyFirst channel for a while and enjoyed watching Tec on it, but there is no specific schedule to tune in on that channel, so the dvd has been great!  We hope more Tec on dvd will be released soon!",1280793600,8,814,4.771428571428571

She likes to name the different animals and make the animal sounds.  I have to admit, I even enjoy watching the show.  It's very entertaining.",1243900800,7,284,4.30188679245283
3511856,5,B001CEK0MQ,"Tec the Tractor is perfect! Beautiful country setting with real people and animals (no animation). The people do everyday farm chores. Teaches kindness to animals and people. I love this show and can't say enough good things abount it. Your children will love it too. My little girl is not afraid of the dentist because she saw ""Katie"" go to the denist. The grammer is corrrect on this show. This farm is clean and I am always amazed how clean the animals are. PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER DVD. PLEASE MAKE MORE SHOWS. YOU SHOULD GET 10 GOLD STARS. Tec himself is just to cute our little girl loves all the characters and knows them by name.",1235692800,22,632,4.504347826086956
3511857,5,B001CEK0MQ,"My little one just loves Baby TV and Tec the tractor is one of his favorites.  He has learned so many words, he will soon be counting.
