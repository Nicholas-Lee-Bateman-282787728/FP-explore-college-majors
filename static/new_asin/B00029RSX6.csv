8024841,2,B00029RSX6,"First, the low rating is for Dr Bloods Coffin. The print seems to be one captured off a television channel, it even has the station bug in the lower corner. It also cuts stalls numerous times in the move.

The other two movies seem to be ok but I haven't watched them all the way through yet.

I've been looking for a good quality print of DBC for some time, and it's not here.",1491868800,,377,4.081081081081081

8024843,5,B00029RSX6,"You can't go wrong with 3 Retro-Era Classic Horror Films! And you can play all 3 back to back without stopping! ""DR.BLOOD'S COFFIN"" leads you down the Mad Scientist's madness road to terror...Then you enter the ""BRAINIAC"" and watch this Monster suck your brains out (though it looks more like licking)...Finally, the Spanish Classic ""FURY OF THE WOLFMAN"" with everything to end your night chilled and thrilled~dungeons,mad doctors,werewolf on the loose,detectives desperate for the answers,and plenty of gothic fog amidst full moon.",1353715200,4,532,5.5
8024844,3,B00029RSX6,"OK. Quick rating rundown: ""Dr. Blood's Coffin"" gets 2 stars, ""The Brainiac"" 1 star, and ""The Fury of the Wolfman"" gets 3 Stars. The Packaging and Quality of the DVDs gets 4 stars.

Now, a little background. ""The Brainiac"" and ""The Fury of the Wolfman"" were part of the massive wave of Spanish-language horror films released from the mid-1960's to the early 70's. ""Wolfman"" is FAR superior for two reasons: one, Paul Naschy wrote and starred in no less than ELEVEN of these werewolf movies, all starring the same character, so he pretty much has this ""wolfman"" thing down! Secondly, this film plays like a blueprint for ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" what with the whips & chains scientist-dominatrix antagonist who ""calls out the dogs"" and is constantly trying to break up every couple who wanders into her country castle of bizarre mind experiments, where she's trying to master complete control of her ex-boyfriend with decreasing success! What a HOOT!

The first film,  ""Dr. Blood's Coffin,"" is really SLOW. But, does have one of the most chilling monolgues by a deranged doctor I have ever heard. Fast forward to the scene where Dr. Blood tries to explain his fascination with death and reinacarnation to his girlfriend, while they are deep underground in an abandoned mine! C-R-E-E-P-Y.

So throw on these three movies and have a saturday night fright fest of your own!",1106524800,8,1376,4.918103448275862
