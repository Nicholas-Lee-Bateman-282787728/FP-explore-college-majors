8222288,5,B000WC4AY8,"This is a great DVD collection of Dannii videos. You get all 20 official videos, 9 bonus videos, 4 behind the scenes, and intros by Dannii herself on each album. You get over 2 and half hours worth of Dannii material all in one DVD. I'm a big fan of her older sister, Kylie, so this DVD was a must for me to finally see little sister perform, my first time to ever view any Dannii videos. I just recently purchased my multi-regional DVD player and this DVD was ordered along with it. The videos are in chronoligical order so you get to see Dannii mature and grow on each video. My favorite videos are Baby Blue, This Is It, All I Wanna Do, Disremembrance, Who Do You Love Now, Put The Needle On It, and I Begin To Wonder.
