8138530,3,B000HCRDLU,"this dvd had some really good concert footage(the black my heart footage is amazing)it's just the sound quality is really bad.  sound quality aside you get to see job for a cowboy when thier bassist still looked 15, winds of plage tear it up, and the warrior make everyone kill eachother.  but i'd only recomend if you were a big fan of some of the bands on the disc.",1174003200,,367,4.304347826086956
