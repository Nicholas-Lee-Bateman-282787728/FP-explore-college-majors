3129576,5,B0014D5GWY,I had only known Renee O'Connor previously from her work on Xena Warrior Princess and was pleasantly surprised by her comic timing and wonderful acting in this movie. To also find out that she co-directed the movie even makes me appreciate her performance more. Diamonds and Guns is a light hearted comedy that was a joy to watch that I would highly recommend.,1206576000,,360,4.73015873015873

8255166,4,B0014D5GWY,"Watched this because Renee O'Connor was all over this one.  Her production company, ROC, released it.  She also was an executive producer for it.

While the story lagged a tiny bit, it was a very funny storyline so that made up for it.

The cast were funny as hell and, of course, Renee was the best.  :)

Saw some other faces I knew in this movie, so that was a surprise.  The INS agent I've seen in NCIS several times as well as Francis's dad.

All around good movie.  Not too long and it was great to see an indie film that one of my favorite actors had produced.

Good on ya, Ren!",1515196800,,584,4.088495575221239

8255170,5,B0014D5GWY,I feel bad for anyone who really wants to see this film and cannot due to the unavailability of the item. Diamonds and Guns is one of the funniest movies i've seen! Renee and Helena have the best comedic timing..the script and dialogue is brilliant! Everyone who wants to see this should be able to! Absolutely love this film!,1394841600,,326,4.5423728813559325

8255172,5,B0014D5GWY,"This movie is worth watching...funny the first time, funnier the second.  All the actors gave it their all. For me, standouts icnluded Renee O'Connor in a small supporting role did a great job and Cynthia Szigeti in an even smaller supporting role was fabulous.  Watch this small gem of a movie.",1233705600,,295,4.764705882352941
8255173,5,B0014D5GWY,"This movie was a joy to watch although it was a low budget film. The cast & crew did a wonderful job, and Renee O'Connor just shines. I was curious to see how it ended, and wasn't dissapointed. This movie may never see an award, but I think people will watch it over & over.",1223856000,,274,4.0
8255174,5,B0014D5GWY,"This is a very low budget, independent film.....but it is also a very fun movie.  It stars Renee O'Connor, who many of you may remember as Gabrielle from the show Xena: Warrior Princess, and Helena Beaven.  It's the story of these 2 friends traveling to Vegas to find Helena's character(a kiwi) a husband to prevent her from being deported.  What follows is a farcical comedy of errors.

This is a must have for any Renee fan, especially given that she not only starred in, but also went on to become producer of the film and took it upon herself to make sure this film saw the light of day.  Again, it's not a fancy big budget film; but it is a fun and entertaining film....and in the end that's all that counts.",1209600000,,713,4.371212121212121
8255175,5,B0014D5GWY,"Helena and Renee are a couple of girls who just wanna have fun but find love...and danger in a veritable Comedy of Eros. This gently-paced RomCom appeals to the heart and the funny-bone in equal measure and is a MUST for all Renee O'Connor fans, who undoubtedly already know the story behind the making of the movie. The supporting cast is excellent, the leads are perfect...Lights...Camera...and...ACTION!!",1206835200,,407,5.181818181818182
