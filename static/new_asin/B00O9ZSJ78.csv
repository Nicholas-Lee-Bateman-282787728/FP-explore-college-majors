8682759,5,B00O9ZSJ78,"The American Experience episode entitled COLD WAR ROADSHOW includes much well-preserved color footage. It tells the story of Nikita Khrushchev's two-week Sept. 1959 stay in the U.S., the first visit here by a Soviet premier. Partly as introduction we see Vice President Richard Nixon butting heads in Moscow with NK at the so-called ""kitchen debate,"" which was captured on tape by American color TV technology.

A meeting in the U.S. with Khrushchev was the result of President Eisenhower's sincere attempt to understand his Soviet counterpart. Nikita's concern was that the USSR be recognized by Ike as our equal, politically and economically if not just militarily. Yet from the beginning this heavily scripted tour hit snags.

Footage of a post-arrival open limo parade has Americans watching quietly from curbs, not knowing whether to cheer or boo. Video of NK's stop at D.C.'s National Press Club shows this charming man was warmly received.

His Day 3 NYC time can be characterized by too much police presence, as there was much concern for Khrushchev's safety. A conciliatory U.N. speech, carefully laced with pro-Soviet propaganda couched in disarmament terms, was also a success.

A Sept. 19th Day 5 celebrity-filled Hollywood banquet almost became a good-natured roast of the often laughing premier. He did get miffed however when told that a Disneyland stop wasn't possible as NK's safety could not be guaranteed. At FOX studios, Khrushchev observed the filming of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CAN-CAN/dp/B000ND91YU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CAN-CAN</a>&nbsp;(1960) dance sequence. Any bonhomie gained was however completely squelched at L.A.'s Ambassador Hotel, where Mayor Norris Poulson gruffly took Nikita to task for a previous statement that ""we (the USSR) will bury you."" Throughout his U.S. stay, the premier had been pummeled with this prosecutorial-like accusation and he was fed up. An angry response where Khrushchev threatened to cut short his visit made headline news.

While on the train to San Francisco, Nikita convinced host Henry Cabot Lodge to let him mingle with the common folks. A round of friendly handshaking resulted, reassurance of our general goodwill and proof in his mind that only the cronies surrounding Pres. Eisenhower were enemies. Despite as many as 340 reporters mobbing the premier at times, his mood brightened considerably by simply touching the masses.

From the outset, a Day 8 visit to the Iowa farmer who created hybrid corn was high on NK's agenda. It was during this leg of the trip that he ate and enjoyed his first hotdog.

On Day 12, all tourism ended, Ike and Nikita went to Camp David for serious talks on major issues. They also agreed to meet again in Paris. But the sides were too far apart to come to any compromises, and a troubled Eisenhower excused himself for a ""power nap."" After this he invited Khrushchev to visit his own family farm. It was a pleasant coda to an often stormy two weeks.

After the visit, a roundtable of American newscasters voiced favorable opinions about recent events.

Seven months later the Soviet downing of a U2 spy plane derailed the upcoming Ike/Nikita Paris summit, this after Eisenhower admitted responsibility for the flight.

In hindsight, the end result of his two week American trip may only have been a vacation from the pressures of Soviet leadership, yet while here Nikita was subjected to other significant irritations. He did however return home with small ideas to improve daily life, such as self-service cafeterias.",1418860800,4,3578,5.3168141592920355
