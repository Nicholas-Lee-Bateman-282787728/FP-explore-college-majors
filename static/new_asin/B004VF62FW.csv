4482517,5,B004VF62FW,"Tornado footage at close range! Views of the tornado range from the poetically beautiful in its slim, beginning funnel stage to the intensely menacing as it forms into a massive, two-mile wide wedge. This was a beautiful storm of blue, gray and black! Debris can be clearly seen swirling around the tornado. At one point, Jeff's vehicle gets so close he has to back it up to avoid being blown away--at which point you see telephone poles near the vehicle being pulled down by the winds, and the tornado just beyond-- UNFORGETABLE FOOTAGE. Film of Tinker Air Force Base just after the tornado left its buildings lying in a mangled mess. You will love this video.",1310342400,,661,4.706896551724138
4482518,5,B004VF62FW,"I've watched a lot of chaser video in my days, but this is simply the greatest I've ever seen! Most chasers make their videos more about the chaser rather than the tornado. This video actually puts the tornado in the starring role! Arguably, one of the most incredible twisters to scar the earth, you are glued to your seat holding your breath, waiting to see what it's going to do next! And then there is the chasing itself. Nearly a lost art form, Jeff works the camera like the seasoned pro he his while working the radio delivering reports to officials like a man possessed, almost as if Mother Nature is challenging Jeff with her deadliest weapon, a battle of the titans. This is how you chase tornadoes! A must see for every person that considers themselves a chaser. Get it now and get one for your friend!

8443272,5,B004VF62FW,"this movie is very cool ;).  the tornado chasers that goes after these f5 tornados, can kill 100s of people in there homes.  the good thing is that some of them did have tornado shelters, and they were ok though.  it's just like the tornados that happened in oklahoma that killed so many people :(.  this movie was sort of sad, because some people didn't have any warnings at all.  i recommend this movie to everyone, and it's good for people to learn about these tornados of what goes on in tornado alley.",1384646400,,506,4.397849462365591
8443273,5,B004VF62FW,"To be able to watch the DVD, this beast of nature from its birth to the aftermath, having a front seat view of it all with Jeff, has enabled me to feel the adrenaline pumping while sitting safely in my home. AMAZING footage and production!! We all remember watching it live on TV that day, snippets of it's onslaught on OKC, but being on the ground like this through all of it, watching that raw power, well...this took me to a whole different level. Thank you!",1380499200,,461,4.372093023255814

8443275,5,B004VF62FW,"One of the better I've seen and was a good education in progressive filming of this huge F5 while it formed and developed and i really credit the filmer with staying with this thing - he got pretty close at times -- so gave it a 5 for fun to watch and very educational to me on formation process just by visually seeing it take shape -- I catch myself now, sort of diagnosing clould shelf formations in bad weather LOL",1377043200,,418,4.172839506172839

We both enjoyed it. Has a lot of tornado action!
