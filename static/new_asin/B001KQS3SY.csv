8315862,4,B001KQS3SY,"I've always liked the F-18, and this company's series of DVD documentaries does it justice. The narrator is monotone, but that's par for the course. Definitely good for military fans.",1359072000,,183,5.133333333333334
8315863,4,B001KQS3SY,"A fairly basic documentary, For someone new to military jets this is a good video for them, but to
those jet enthusiasts looking for more than the basics,
forget it. The footage is mostly grainy and dated however there is a little section on the Blue Angels that shows good footage of flying in the diamond and the picture is much clearer.",1311465600,2,339,4.483870967741935
8315864,4,B001KQS3SY,"I give this DVD an 85 out of 100.  Very informative but it has a few minor errors, the most notable being the mention that the US Marines fly the FA18E/F Super Hornet, which they don't (USMC is waiting for the F35B Lighting 2).  Still, for $9.99 it is a good bargain.",1277078400,2,267,4.115384615384615
