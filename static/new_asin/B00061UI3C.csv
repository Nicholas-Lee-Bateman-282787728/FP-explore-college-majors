2158813,5,B00061UI3C,Sad subject & so little available resources. I strongly recommend. If cost bothers you check with local library. I bought this copy as a gift but my library had this.,1423785600,3,166,4.566666666666666
2158814,4,B00061UI3C,This has helped us in the process of recovery after our son completed suicide. This was used in our Surviivors of Suicide sessions so we bought it to view again and try to help others who are having to deal with the unexpected fierce goodbye.,1362700800,2,242,4.4
2158815,5,B00061UI3C,"I purchased this shortly after a woman I had come to care for deeply completed suicide.  This DVD helped me to understand that I was not losing my mind and that all of the crazy feelings and emotions I was dealing with were in fact normal.

It tells the stories of a number of families who have suffered the loss of a loved one to suicide and their attempts to deal with it.  Faith is a main theme throughout, coming from the perspective of primarily Christianity but also a couple of Jewish clergy as well.

After having viewed this DVD about a half dozen times already, I can tell you that it has been very healing for me.  When I feel a jag of grief or pain or feel a crying spell come on I put the DVD on, and I just find that it helps me to hear the stories that these people have to say.  I actually like these people in this DVD.  It would be good to sit down with them in person and discuss it further.

Judy Collins is the host of this documentary, and she does an excellent job of doing her part in communicating the need to educate the public about suicide and the taboos associated with it.

This DVD, ""Fierce Goodbye,"" has been a lifeline for me and my very personal attempt to understand and heal from this tragedy in my life.",1230508800,12,1240,4.154811715481172
2158816,5,B00061UI3C,"I bought this for a friend who lost her mother to suicide.  I was very pleased with it and thought it was well done.  I particularly liked that different families and situations were portrayed.  This is the only DVD I found on suicide that wasn't directed specifically toward teens, and it is very good, thankfully.",1214179200,5,315,4.6909090909090905
2158817,5,B00061UI3C,"Excellent for all who have been touched by suicide.  Helps them to realize they are not ""going crazy"" when experiencing this special grief.",1207612800,2,139,5.043478260869565
8036875,2,B00061UI3C,"My sister committed suicide 2 months ago.  I have done much research on-line and purchased books on sibling loss and suicide in general.  Therefore, this short movie didn't really provide any new information--other than that we have a Suicide epidemic.  One thing on-line I have found of comfort is the ""5 Myths of Suicide.""",1525392000,,324,4.962962962962963

8036884,4,B00061UI3C,"I lost my beautiful 24 year old son to suicide, and have read books on the subject, but not seen any videos.  I felt it barely touched the subject matter though, as it couldn't possibly based on the very short duration of it. I hadn't noted this at the time I made the instant video purchase, so make sure you are aware.

One thing...the movie couldn't have been given a more appropriate title. The moment I saw it? I knew it was about suicide. I hope none of you reading this EVER has to know...how *I* knew what it meant. If you do, I am so so very sorry for your loss.

I was torn, as while it can provide some comfort in the sense I am *not* alone in all these feelings I have had, and continue to have? It rips my heart open anew to know how very many others have gone through what I have, and that there are so many out there YET to go through what I have. I am now 53 years old, and was not touched by suicide in any way until these last five years, in which I was touched by it FIVE times. It is a runaway epidemic of absolutely devastating loss, and yet is barely spoken of. How can this be? I do thank Judy Collins, and the other loved ones who shared their very personal stories, as well as the makers of the film for at least doing that...for putting it out there. So many of us have no avenue to talk about this, so just the fact this could open dialogues is a very good thing.",1440892800,4,1390,3.9928057553956835
