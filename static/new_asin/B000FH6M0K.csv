It is very informal and enjoyable.

I have already had one of  DVD's by Suzanne COX but this one is in CD form and with today's technology very useful.

Thank you.",1355184000,,263,3.9056603773584904
8122514,2,B000FH6M0K,"I, too, bought this dvd at Walmart for $1 and thought, what the heck, it's only $1.  Don't get me wrong, it's a decent workout that will leave you sweating, as long as you keep up with the poor cueing.

For one, it's very misleading.  The dvd isn't 60 minutes as stated on the back of the cover, but only 50 minutes.  35 of those minutes are the ""dance"" part while the last 15 minutes is toning with upper and lower body and stretching.  The dance portion is broken up into 3 segments if I remember correctly: salsa, funk, and disco.  It made me laugh because to me, the exercises she does, isn't really a dance.  For example, I hardly classify doing the ""sashay"" a salsa routine, nor would the ""grapevine"" be considered disco.  She also makes the comment about doing these routines out on the dance floor.  Unless you want to be laughed at or made to look like a complete idiot, save these ""moves"" for the privacy of your own home.",1163548800,4,932,4.341040462427745
8122515,3,B000FH6M0K,"I recently bought this DVD at Wal-Mart for $1 and just thought I'd give it a try for a change in my routine.  I'm an intermediate level fitness video enthusiast, so I appreciated the fact that they give low impact and high impact demonstrations during each routine. Some of the moves were a little dancy for my taste and their cueing isn't the best, but I think I should be able to master the moves within a few viewings.  Occasionally the language difference (they're from the U.K.) popped up, but it wasn't a big deal.  The strength training routine does not involve weights, but you could easily add some small hand weights to increase your intensity.  There is really no ab work in this workout.  They spend a bit of time on stretching out the lower body at the end, but really no time on the upper body.  I liked the fact that during each 5-minute segment, they would occasionally flash a timer at the bottom of the screen, so you would know how much time was left in that section.  The label of the DVD says that it's approximately 60 minutes, but if you only include the warmup, workout and stretching, it's really about 46 minutes.  The label copyright says 2006, but I believe the video was originally released on VHS in 1997.  The camera angles (which can be confusing) and wardrobe lead me to believe this is true.  Overall, a nice change of pace, and I look forward to doing it again.",1152835200,3,1396,4.460629921259843
