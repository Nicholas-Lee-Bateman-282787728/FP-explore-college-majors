228135,3,6300214133,"I LOVE watching the collection of clips from so-bad-they're-good movies, and the narration is OK to pretty good (Dan Ackroyd's narration is hilarious), but the filmed segments with Ackroyd, Gilda Radner, John Candy and Cheech and Chong are worthless, add nothing to the movie, and should never have been attempted. For serious bad film aficionados, I recommend this thing, but be sure to fast forward through those dumb live action scenes to get to the good (I mean bad) stuff.",1095638400,2,477,4.975
228136,3,6300214133,"That's what you will ask yourself while you watch the worst collection of films ever made for audiences ever! You'll get a kick out of seeing how cheesy the sets and costumes were, and of course, they give a big HATS OFF! to Ed Wood, ""King of the D Movie."" Only for those who think today's movies are lousy -- think you have it bad now? Watch what audiences during the 50s-71 had to deal with!!",1053388800,,394,4.197368421052632
228137,5,6300214133,"When I Was 8 years old my dad rented this film. I remember all the in-side jokes, SNL cast and of course Cheech& Chong. It became a staple of my pop culture world, I lost track over the years and now 20 years later I now go back the the place in my head. Most kids my age never saw or heard of this film, well I love Star Wars too, but I went beyond that. In 1982 Bill Paxton's Fish Heads video and It Came From Hollywood were my cult favorets at 8 years old, amazing how some things never change.",1030924800,,497,3.8823529411764706

At a mere 81 minutes this beer swillin', politically incorrect video manages to pack an in an incredible ammount of stuff. I've watched the video several times and I still pick up stuff I've forgotten or missed on previous viewings. Having sat (and yawned) through a few of the films from which this video is compiled (""The Hypnotic Eye"" for example) I can say with confidance that excising the most ridiculous bits does no disservice to the originals. This is the best way to see 100 Z-movies in the shortest time. As to the commentary: the red-herring jokes meld perfectly with the red-herring dialog of the clips. Forget nay-sayers, this video is worth it.",1019779200,12,1156,4.873096446700508
228139,4,6300214133,"This movie is full of snippets from partly hard-to-find movies like ""Prince of Space"", ""Fire Maidens from Outer Space"", ""I married a Monster from Outer Space"", ""From Hell it came"" or ""Battle in Outer Space"" e.g. So far I can only recommend it. But you have to get through the very lame jokes from Aykroyd, Candy and Co who want to be funny in between. But on the other hand there is always the possibility to press the fast forward button on your video recorder :-)",998179200,3,465,4.4186046511627906
228140,4,6300214133,"The commentary is real histerical, and the openingsfor eachsegment are real funny also. The comedians really are funny when youhear them against the cheesy movie segments.",947462400,,171,5.615384615384615
7805256,5,6300214133,"This film is a masterpiece of irreverent comedy, the cream of B-rated sci-if and horror clips, and one of the best party, laugh-out-loud assembly's of mad-cap mayhem I've ever seen. I'm not sure if this VERY UN-politically correct movie will ever venture into the DVD world , partially because of all the rights they would need to secure, as well as all the fuss it would raise with the politically correct crowds. It still floats out there in various video sharing formats as well as on Out-Of-Print (OOP) VHS copies. Bootlegs are out there too and whatever way you search out to see it will be worth the work. Those Who are fans of old science fiction and horror movies will be especially happy. Those clips from the plan nine from outer space and all of the rubber suited monsters are precious Gems just waiting to be seen. Relax and stop taking life so seriously for an evening and take this oddly warped and comedic jog down some of the less travelled cinematic memories.",1453420800,,976,4.614942528735632
7805257,5,6300214133,"First things first: I'm not telling you to rush out and buy a VHS machine to watch this, nor to pay a king's ransom for it on VHS even if you have a VCR.  What I'm hoping for is that if we check this website enough, or contact the studio, we might just get the film out on DVD...
As to the film itself, it was a brilliant spoof of the film business.  Now remember, in yesteryear, the studios put out a lot of 'filler' movies, B films or worse, to fill up the omnipresent theatres, etc.  People had no TV and only radio, so movies were the only visual medium.  It's inevitable that some of it would be weak, or worse, and this film dredges up some real (fill in the blank) which is absolutely hilarious.
The stars are the film clips, but we have hosts such as Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Gilda Radner and Cheech&Chong, adding their smarmy comments in just the right tone of mock political correctness.
There are so many great scenes that we can't describe them all.  However, the mad scientists, the 'science fiction' with gorilla or bear suits used in place of space suits(because they rented cheaper), the 'special effects' of the giant flying chicken, the synchronized swimming/dancing/singing...well, you get the picture...
If enough people want this out on DVD, it has a chance.  If no one cares, then all we will have of it are a handful of expensive VHS collector tapes.  We can hope...",1419638400,,1389,4.488095238095238
7805258,4,6300214133,"A funny collection of clips from shlock/camp/grade-z films, linked by some entertaining segments from SNL performers. In the days before the internet, this was a more valuable collection for fans of bad movies. Fortunately today, nearly all of these films can be seen in their entirety on YouTube. You can also see IT CAME FROM HOLLYWOOD there, which is sadly not available on DVD.",1395532800,,381,4.96875

7805261,5,6300214133,I saw this on TV in the 1980's.  I remembered it because the commentary the celebrities provided was so funny.  My how films have changed over the years and realize how bad some were.,1277769600,,183,4.352941176470588
7805262,4,6300214133,I loved this movie when I was a kid.  I was so glad to find a copy of it.  It is entertaining in a very light hearted way.  Anyone who loves old movies will enjoy this film.  It highlights some of the best-of-the-worst in film.  Gotta love it!,1254787200,,243,3.9791666666666665
7805263,5,6300214133,"When you consider that both John & Gilda are now gone, this makes this compilation even that more precious.  This is a wonderful and hilarious collection of vintage clips interspered with filmed clips of these wonderful comedians to create an excellent comedic scrapbook featuring some of our most treasured humorists.

It is indeed a shame this has not been reissued on DVD because it is certainly worth it.  Those of us needing to have this on DVD will just have to purchase the VHS and re-record it at home on DVD for better preservation.

But the gems are the classic bits from a stalwart comedic ensemble - of course all of the skits don't hit the mark - but this is because one is unable to see the forest for the trees.

Besides, the very last clip with the guys getting in the car says it al...comedy classic to be sure!!!

I hiiiiiiiiiiiiiighly recommend!!!!!!!!!",1197331200,3,872,4.62987012987013

7805265,5,6300214133,"This really is a fun little movie.  If you love those great 50s sci-fi gems this is a must for you.  Done in a tongue-in-cheek style ""It Came from Hollywood"" is a compellation of some of the funniest (unintentionally) scenes from some of the cheesiest movies ever made.  Absolutely hysterical, especially for fans of the genre.  Highly recommended.

Sadly this was never released on DVD.  Various DVD websites have indicated that it was cancelled before it was released. Martin Blythe of Paramount confirmed it in a post at DVD Talk. Paramount took this off of their July 2002 schedule because of those dreaded ""clearance problems.""

On a down note, through recent correspondence with Paramount I asked if they were planning on revisiting a release of this title sometime in the future and was told ""no plans - clearances would be impossible"". C'MON PARAMOUNT - NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!",1095897600,26,951,5.378378378378378
