8130436,5,B000GBI3IY,"I saw this movie on my flight back home from Spain in 1998.  Although I was exhausted, I watched the film, laughed, cried and couldn't wait for it to come out in the US. Unfortunately, it never played around here and even worse, I couldn't remember the name of the film until recently.  This was the first Spanish Civil War film I had seen and it was compelling. Especially since the Civil War was a tabboo subject (el olvido) after the death of Franco so that Spain could give itself time to forget and move past the horrors of civil war, dictatorship and develop its democracy.  This film portrays the heroic sacrifices Manuel makes to protect ""Paco"" Goya's self-portrait and the struggles the people had to endure to protect themselves from the greedy and harsh reign of Facism.",1185235200,,781,4.644927536231884
