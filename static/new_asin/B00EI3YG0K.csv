5915210,1,B00EI3YG0K,do not waste your time watching this horrible thing. It seemed like I was watching a 1/2 hour music video before we could not take it any longer and started fast-forwarding to see if it was possible there might actually be a story somewhere. We could not find it and neither will you. We are disputing the charge because the quality of this product was crap.,1385251200,2,358,4.4393939393939394
5915211,1,B00EI3YG0K,WOW.  Quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I kept watching through the end in a state of disbelief.  Its got to get better-it cant possibly be this stupid I kept thinking.  I was wrong.,1384905600,2,206,4.205128205128205

I enjoyed Red Riding Hood and I also enjoyed Twilight. She makes fun, light and fluffy fantasy movies. This movie was really kinda boring. Cam Gigandet was  mechanical and pathetic in his performance. Xavier Samuels wasn't very good either( and I really like him as an actor). I always wonder what draws  an actor to a role and this one really left me wondering.",1383091200,,498,4.584269662921348
5915213,4,B00EI3YG0K,"I enjoyed the movie.  It isn't going to win any academy awards nor did it bring anything new to the genre but it was enjoyable and held my interest.  A singer has an affair and things start going wrong for her.  It reminds me of Fatal Attraction meets Fear.  I thought the acting and pacing was nice.  You get a chance to get to know Hayle and see how she struggles with the death of her brother, her insecurities and how it reflects in her music.  I also enjoyed the music featured in the film. That being said I was a bit disappointed that the movie dropped the suit/tie wearing fan stalker aspect.  It would have been nice to have him be tied into her tormenter much like the other deaths that surround her.  I don't want to say too much and ruin the movie but it is worth a watch.",1382140800,2,784,4.145695364238411
5915214,4,B00EI3YG0K,"""Plush"" (2013 release; 99 min.) is the name of a rock band fronted by singer Hayley (think of her as Amy Lee of Evanescence-meets-Hayley Williams of Paramore) and her brother Jack who plays the electric guitar. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, Jack dies of a drug overdose, and Hayley must plow on with the band. Jack's replacement in the band, Enzo, is openly gay but nevertheless has his eyes on Hayley, who is married (to Carter) with 2 young kids. Being on the road and insecure, Hayley finally gives in to Enzo's advances and they start a blazing hot affair. While all this is happening, a creepy guy who claims to be a mega-fan of Hayley keeps following her around. At the end of the tour when Hayley returns hom, Enzo manages to befriend her kids and Carter. At this point we are not even halfway into the movie. Will Hayley and Enzo continue their affair? Does Enzo have his eyes also on Carter? Can Hayley and Carter save their marriage? And what are the real motives of that creepy fan stalking Hayley? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience of this plot-heavy movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is directed, co-written and co-produced by Catherine Hardwicke, who brought us the first of the ""Twilight"" movies, and more recently ""Red Riding Hood"", just to name those. This movie displays very much the same touch as ""Twilight"", even if the subject matter is quite different. Second, the music plays a HUGE role in this movie, and comes from uber-producer Nick Launay (Nick Cave, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Grinderman, and many others). The music itself is definitely along the Evanescence-meets-Paramore lines. Third, the acting performances were not quite as good or as believable as I had hoped. When you see Emily Browning on the screen as Hayley, I simply wasn't convinced that this was a real, troubled rock star on the screen (which of course she isn't--but her job is to have me believe that she is). Last but certainly not least, there are some 'erotic' scenes (including some hints of S&M) in the movie, which I frankly found anything but that. But if these things are objectionable to you, save yourself the trouble and watch a different movie.

""Plush"" opened without any pre-release fanfare or advertizing whatsoever on a single screen here in Greater Cincinnati last weekend, and when I noticed it would already be gone tomorrow, I went ahead to see this today on the last day it's in the theatre here. Not surprisingly, the screening was not well attended (3 people to be exact, including myself). That aside, ""Plush"" turns out to be okay and superficially enjoyable.",1379548800,8,2689,4.743589743589744
5915215,4,B00EI3YG0K,"This review contains spoilers. Read at your own risk, though I will asterisk the lines that have the big ones next to them and I tried not to spoil any big reveals.

Hayley (the amazing Emily Browning) is a struggling rockstar. After the death of her band-mate and brother (played by Thomas Dekker), she sets out to write 'emotional' music that she hopes people will understand after her brother's tragic and sudden *overdose. Enzo (Xavier Samuel) joins the band, and despite the fact that Hayley is married to a journalist (Cam Gigandet - whose acting admittedly falls very flat and almost dulls the story completely each time he is on screen, the main reason for my 4 and not 5 star rating) with a family... she submits to the 'gay', but supposedly bi-sexual Enzo and they begin an affair that she claims will just last them on tour. It does; until he starts showing up with gifts and trying to interact with her children. Hayley discovers he's much more than just a part of the band or an on tour lover. *Eventually - though it becomes quite clear early on - it's revealed he's been obsessed with Plush since the very beginning. Enzo is a mad-man that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He reveals a very troubled and abused childhood, and ultimately another side to him completely. His mother (Frances Fisher) is just as dark and twisted and plays a key role at the end of the film.

There are scenes of a highly sexual nature (some veering toward non-consent) and violence so it isn't for the faint of heart or people who are disturbed by that sort of thing. The director (Catherine Hardwicke) made references to '50 Shades of Grey' when describing her decision to go 'all the way' while filming if I remember correctly. Samuel's performance is just brilliant and he deserves attention for this role. Browning is good, but she shines the most during the songs - she has a GREAT voice and was asked to release her own music after her songs for the Sucker Punch soundtrack. You can really see why in this movie. All of the songs within the film are original and I liked every one of them. My favorite was the slowest one written about the demise of Hayley's brother, it's a haunting melody that nearly everyone was captivated by in the theater at my showing.

Definitely worth a watch, a buy and a soundtrack purchase!",1379203200,14,2329,4.5669856459330145

Enzo (Xavier Samuel) who is obsessed with their music, replaces Jack in the band. It isn't long before the formulaic infidelity and with Enzo becoming too dark for Hayley...and oh, they tie back into the beginning in a most boring way.

The lack of originality made this thriller, lacking for real thrills. Okay rental.

8605564,1,B00EI3YG0K,"A absolute catastrophe, a non-nucleoside polymerase slide of pure horribly clichd e-bola virus. A miserable copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a pseudo wanna be thriller slash horror almost straight to video piece of garbage. I kept waiting for Emily Browning to break out and finally show off some of her amazing acting chops as well as that dynamic screen prescence that I'm used too but it's as if she was sleeping throughout the entire shoot of this thing, I'm sorry but I can't even call this a film, whatever it was trying to mock. More then likely it was simply Catherine's childlike direction. There was no believing that she was some troubled drink and drugged out rock star,  she simply came across as another reviewer said, 'The sorry I got caught and I'm pregnant by a sociopath slutty housewife' that I believed.  Cam Ciganet wasn't much better,  neither may be true  A - listers but I've come to not only enjoy and respect both of them onscreen but hoped beyond hope that their spirit of greatness combined could save this thing. Emily seemed to feel disdain, hate and treated him as her husband in this whatever it was (cheap carnival sideshow attraction maybe) as if he was exactly like his performance in this lackluster farce, 'INVISIBLE '!! Xavier Samuel must have thought this was,' Mayberry RFD's Halloween community theatre but forget to bring Andy, Otis and Barney along for spiritual and acting support. He and his accomplise were so bad at being bad guys that their attempts to try to make this carnival sideshow work was so silly that it made me want to slit my own throat. How could Arty Nelson and Catherine Hardwick ever think that whatever this was could ever be any more solid then her fake Hollywood name, it's almost as if they sat down with 1000 scripts from the world's worst of the worst lost found footage movies made or never made and took a line from this one then a paragraph from this other one maybe a whole scene from another and then decided that they had a screenplay. Catherine what's up with that stupid told in a gazillion better ways ending? Was that suppose to be a cosmetic inhancement of your room temperature IQ'd imagination? What were you thinking? That in some way it was a great artistic twisted thriller for an ending?  Well it wasn't,  it was as disappointing as silly and has been shown and directed better in every bad movie currently known to mankind. Catherine go put your head in the sand and don't come out until your told. I spent too many years in the same business to see you bastar__ize an art form that isn't important first and foremost because of its intellectual, fervent or visceral beauty but because it's archival and is a perfect recording of our history but you just showed archeologists 200 years from now how unintelligent and beguiled by small things and desperatration their 21st century ancestors were. Ed Wood made better movies, at least, 'Plan 9 from outer space' was funny! Now put your head back in the sand and think about the black eye you gave this business. That's your pennance! On a positive note it's a decent soundtrack Emily has a wonderful voice and there was one single wonderful performance in this thing. My love and respect goes out to Dawn Olivieri who played Anne,  Emily's manager. Her performance was wonderfull, believable, funny, sexy, intelligent and did I say sexy? But this thing was so heavily clichd that I couldn't feel bad for her when (yes a spoiler) she died because I knew 15 minutes into the thing that she would be one of the first to go. She did a stand up job and is a delight to watch onscreen. Well I'm going to go and watch something that will make me feel better like Charlotte Gainsbourg in Von Triers, 'AntiChrist' it's always fun to watch one of the most beautiful and great actresses standing on this planet, play a kinda confused witch. If you really want to see a well done deeply disturbing  movie watch this one. It's usually a hard to find movie but I am fairly sure amazon sells it now for a reasonable price. I had to pay 75 dollars for a used copy. Catherine go put your head back in the sand.",1452384000,,4154,4.536715620827771
8605565,4,B00EI3YG0K,"this is a telling movie about the life and antics of a rock star, male or female. the temptations and pitfalls apply to both sexes. the gist of this story is that these people are so wrapped up in themselves and so in love with the fame and all it brings them, that they think that they  can separate their professional life from their personal and family life. in other words what takes place on the road is totally acceptable  and as long as the family back home doesnt know, well then, life is just great. but there are consequences and our heroine will find that out the hard way.  the following is a spoiler alert, so if you don't want to know how it ends, click off.
