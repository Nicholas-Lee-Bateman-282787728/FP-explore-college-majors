After 42 minutes I couldn't take it anymore. It looks like one camera recorded the entire movie.",1521417600,,270,4.0
8066502,1,B0009U5FTW,"This movie starts off with a statement: ""Warning: Please don't take this film seriously.""  If they have to apologize from jump, then you KNOW it was downhill from there!

Near the beginning, a man says to his female partner ""Let's go to Africa"" and she rolls her eyes at that idea.  Okay, that was a funny zinger on ""Belly.""  However, this movie actually steals from ""Belly"" in several other places.  At one point, a man is talking to another man with a fake West Indian accent.  This was clearly meant to imitate Ox from ""Belly.""  Then, the main character is in an SUV and says to his friends ""Let's do something more positive than this"" and his friends poo-poo it.  That same thing happened between Nas and DMX in ""Belly.""  Talk about a ripoff!

Then too, the production values were sooooo low.  Characters are supposed to be hanging out at night and you can clearly tell there's just a black curtain in the background, no stars, no streetlights, nothing real.  The film eats time by showing bruthas rapping and sistas changing clothes.  This points to the paper-thin plot.  In the Spanish subtitles, a rapper says ""lyrics"" and it gets translated as the Spanish word for ""liver.""

Only see this is you have masochistic tendencies.",1292544000,,1232,4.691588785046729
