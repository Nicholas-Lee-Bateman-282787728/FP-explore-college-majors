This video is quite old now and Mr. Worden has progressed a great deal since the time it was made. However, it lays out his methods well. Training in his garage converted dojo, he shows you how to completely dismantle your opponent. He employs a no-nonsense, down and dirty, in your face approach. His material is geared for real-life situations wherever they may occur, in the street, bar, your home, anywhere. I highly recommend this video to everyone. Look him up on the net for many more excellent videos.",1253232000,4,674,4.625
