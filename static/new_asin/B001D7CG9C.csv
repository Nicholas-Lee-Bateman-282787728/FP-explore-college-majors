8574496,3,B001D7CG9C,"Dvds are fine. Macgyver is great and full of action!
The only bad thing about this particular set is that all the dvds come in super cheap plastic sleeves and are difficult to remove.
I would definitly recommend MacGyver to anyone, the shows are action packed but not gory as some shows are today on this order.
I would not recommend this exact set, paying a little more for the individual seasons is definitly a better deal!",1283126400,4,425,4.532467532467533
