8385614,5,B0030BYWM8,"As a Muse fan, this documentary gives you a good chronology of Muse's evolution and influences.

8385619,1,B0030BYWM8,"If you are interested in what the music press has to say about MUSE, knock yourself out.  This is not a documentary of the band, nor does it contain interviews or insight into their impressive history.  If I wanted the opinion of the music press, I would read the NME.  A complete waste of time and money.",1269993600,37,305,4.315789473684211
