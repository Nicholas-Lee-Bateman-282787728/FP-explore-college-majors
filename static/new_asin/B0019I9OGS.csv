8274118,3,B0019I9OGS,"I found this video of only marginal help in improving my game. Bollettieri is too hyper and dogmatic, and all too often the videos don't back up the point being made. For example, he tells you a strategy to win a point. Then the players in the video who are supposed to illustrate what he wants them to do, end the point by hitting the ball out.

I expected better from Bollettieri, one of the best in the business.",1343520000,,526,4.3232323232323235
