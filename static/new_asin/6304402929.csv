868355,5,6304402929,A movie that brings many memories in the early sixties. Goog price and good packaging,1466208000,,85,4.733333333333333
868356,4,6304402929,"What is there about this 1965 Elvis film?  It's certainly not his best movie or even close to it. But it's a fun ""guilty pleasure"" movie, sort of like those Charlie Chan Monogram films of the late 1940's - low quality, but pleasant entertainment. Don't expect much from this movie, but it somehow manages to continue to have an appeal and be fun to watch more than 50 years after it was made.

Elvis plays a rodeo star who we never actually see on horseback (the rodeo scenes aren't him) and looks immaculate from the moment he steps off the bus. His clothes never seem to hold any dirt, and the jeeps and cars in the movie are always sparkling clean and shiny, even after driving through the desert. Elvis's hair is shiny. What's the likelihood of finding a restored historic hotel ready for guests, sitting open and empty in a ghost town?  This movie was great for teens and pre-teens in 1965. And those of us older fans now, who just go along and ignore a lot of the stuff that doesn't make sense.

Elvis's co-stars are all good. Jack Mullaney as  ""Stanley""  has a good supportive role in the movie and adds a lot of laughs, and there are many other actresses and actors who filter in and out of the scenes. Julie Adams's role is never developed and she seems virtually lost in the film (and by the way, notice amazon's incredible mistake in their description of this film: ""Elvis Presley stars with Julie ANDREWS (The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins) as a singing rodeo rider who...."").  I didn't care that much for Jocelyn Lane's role in the film as his lady interest, as her character is more of an antagonist than friend, with an attitude toward Elvis of ""I don't like or trust you, keep away from me, but save me!""  until the end of the movie. And then they get married. And notice Elvis pal and bodyguard Red West in the early part of the film, who goes up and fights Elvis after he sings. Elvis gets into a lot of fights in this movie.

The title of the film, ""Tickle Me"", is a mystery.  There's no title song, and no songs were written specifically for this movie, which is unusual. No soundtrack LP was issued either. The 9 songs in the movie were quite old at the time (some even 5 years old) taken mostly from the old 1960 and 1962 albums ""Elvis Is Back"" and ""Potluck"". The songs are pretty good but some seem a little out of place, like ""Night Rider"".  To me the best songs in the film are ""Put the Blame on Me"", ""Slowly But Surely"", and the opening song ""Long Lonely Highway"". Notice that a lot of the songs were overdubbed with extra singers and strings for the movie, and I don't think these overdubbed version have ever been issued on record/CD (if so, could another Elvis fan direct me where to find them on CD).  Evidently a lot of other songs were considered, such as ""Gonna Get Back Home Somehow"", ""Make Me Know It"" and ""There's Always Me"". If they had been, it would have made a very strong soundtrack album.

I bought this DVD from a store in August 2007, and at that time it came with five 5x7 bonus stills from the movie. I find myself pulling this out a couple times each year and watching it. It's always going to be a minor film, but it's always going to be fun.",1457222400,,3189,4.330536912751678

868443,3,6304402929,"Tickle Me is not a great Elvis movie.  And maybe not a very good one.  But I can't help but like it anyway.  By the time Elvis made this film, his films for the most part were on a downward trend with the plots being almost interchangeable.  Insert some mostly forgettable songs, one jealous love interest, and then surround Elvis with a large group of adoring female fans ready to swoon over each and every one of his muscle twitches.

But this film has just enough for me to give it a recommendation.  First and foremost it has Jocelyn Lane as his co-star.  And she is a knock-out.  I thought so the first time I saw this movie in the sixties and still do. Who cares if she isn't given a lot to do?  Believe me, it isn't important.  But Pam (Jocelyn Lane) does have a secret involving some lost gold coins and there are some bad guys hanging around the weight loss dude ranch for pampered females where she works and Elvis as Lonnie Beal mostly plays while he figures out a way to break down the iceberg known as Pam.  It doesn't hurt that Lonnie always happens to be nearby whenever the bad guys try to do Pam in.

Jack Mullaney is on hand as the goofy second banana, something he was pretty good at in these types of film.  Julie Adams is the owner of the ranch, Vera Radford, who hires Lonnie and not because of his rodeo skills and later throws cold water on the Lonnie/Pam duet when Pam walks in on Vera's seduction of a pretty willing Lonnie.  Well, Elvis relationships in these films were never easy.

The songs are forgettable for the most part, although I did enjoy a couple of them particularly the catchy song Elvis croons in the jeep to Pam at the end, Slowly But Surely.

There's a pretty decent slapstick sequence that takes place in a restored hotel that may or may not be haunted. The mystery of who is after Pam's treasure (the gold coins, not the other one) may or may not keep you guessing.  Norman Taurog directs, and his Elvis films always seem a little bit better than some others probably because I don't think anybody takes this stuff seriously and they weren't kidding themselves that it was high art. It looks like they all had a good time doing that and it shows up on the screen even if the production values aren't there. It's all done on the studio lot.  Watch closely every time that jeep drives out of the ranch.  The film is obviously speeded up to make it appear it's driving out faster than it is and it's kind of funny.

The digital Amazon HD presentation is okay but I have nothing to compare it to as far as a DVD.  I do know the HD presentation on Warner Archive Subscription Streaming was better (I sampled both), but they stream in 1080 P and Amazon in 720 P so obviously Warner had the edge and it shows.  Maybe it's time for Amazon to up their game.

Anyway, if you're an Elvis fan I'm sure you'll watch regardless.  Everybody else might find something here to be amused with.  And failing all that, well there's always Jocelyn Lane. Nobody has ever filled out a pair of white gym shorts and a T-shirt any better.  And you can take that to the bank.",1435363200,,3094,4.318890814558059

868800,5,6304402929,"This little picture, which saved Allied Artists from bankruptcy in 1965, the same year Elvis starred in ""Girl Happy"" and ""Harum Scarum"" for bigger studios saves Elvis from a lot of embarrassment about his career in films.  The Colonel knew he was packaging a ""B"" film for Elvis as Elvis in his films recorded the soundtracks first, so integral were they to his esteem, but with ""Tickle Me"" to save on the time allotted to the picture (which is rumored to be about a two week shooting schedule), no new songs were recorded, the nine songs in the picture taken from Elvis albums released in the several years that had transpired since his release from the Army.  The script was by the team of Elwood Ullman and Edward Bernds, the team responsible for some Three Stooges comedies.  It never took itself seriously and Elvis even parodied himself which added to its charm.  His co-star was the stunningly beautiful Jocelyn Lane as ""Pam"" who gets the least credit in the Elvis Film Encyclopedia and even marries him in the film.  Directed by Norman Taurog, a veteran movie director who had won an Oscar for directing Jackie Cooper in ""Skippy"" in 1931 and directed ten Elvis outings in all was considered an ""entertainer's director"" and once again he pulls off a rather satisfying movie.  Taurog believed in Elvis obviously and thought that with better quality scripts, Elvis could really be quite an actor.  But with a carnival huckster for a manager like the Colonel, Elvis as a freak in a freak show was wearing thin.  The more the Colonel tried to stabilize Elvis's career like having him do travelogues to bossa nova numbers and putting him in the Army, the less we could see the true potential of his star attraction.  Elvis plays ""Lonnie Beale"" a rodeo star who earns extra money working on a dude ranch... for girls!  Also in the cast are the Norman Taurog staple Jack Mullaney as Elvis's sidekick, ""Stanley,"" Julie Adams as his boss, ""Vera Radford"" and Merry Anders delightful to see again (of TV's ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" TV series) as one of the clientele.  ""Pam Merritt"" is a co-worker of Elvis's at the ranch looking in a nearby ghost town for her grandfather's hidden gold.  The trio are challenged by some unscrupulous locals after the hidden money.  Warner Bros. who now owns the film have provided a great transfer.  Each time the film comes up with new packaging, I understand it makes its cost back yet once again.  It's a crying shame Elvis never got to know really how well he was doing, despite the coming decline of his film career.

868898,4,6304402929,"I ENJOY ELVIS MOVIES. I THINK THE ONLY OTHER CATEGORY OF MOVIES I HAVE MORE OF OTHER THAN ELVIS PRESLEY MOVIES ARE MUSICALS AND BEACH MOVIES, FROM THE ""50's AND 60's"" OF COURSE. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHY WAS THE MOVIE TITLED: ""TICKLE ME""? THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF HIS FILMS, BEING ONE OF THE FIRST I ENJOY WATCHING WHEN I WANT TO HAVE AN ""ELVIS MOVIES DAY"". I FIRST SAW THIS ONE BACK IN THE ""90's"" WHEN ONE OF THE CABLE STATIONS WAS HAVING AN ""ELVIS WEEK"" TO CELEBRATE HIS BIRTHDAY. I RECORDED IT, AND EVENTUALLY I BOUGHT IT ON VHS. I GUESS FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER TITLE, ""TICKLE ME"" WAS IT. THE MOVIE OPENS WITH ""LONNIE BEALE"" (ELVIS) ON A BUS HEADING TO A FICTITIOUS TOWN CALLED ""ZUNI WELLS"". HE WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET A FRIEND HE NAMED AS ""PETE BULLMAN"" WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO GET HIM A JOB, WORKING ON A RANCH. HE WAS THEN INFORMED THAT ""PETE"" HAD GOTTEN INTO A FIGHT AND QUIT. THEN BEING STRANDED WITHOUT A JOB HE LITERALLY HAD TO SING FOR HIS SUPPER. DO YOU THINK THIS IS WHERE THE TERM ""SING FOR YOUR SUPPER"" CAME FROM! ANYWAY, WHILE HE IS IN A LOCAL CLUB, SINGING, HE IS SPOTTED BY ""VERA RADFORD"", (JULIE ADAMS) SITTING WITH HER ESCORT & SWIMMING INSTRUCTOR AT HER RANCH, ""BRAD BENTLEY"", (EDWARD FAULKNER). ""VERA"" OFFERS HIM A JOB AFTER HE GETS INTO A FIGHT WITH ONE OF THE CUSTOMER'S WHOSE GIRL WAS COMING ONTO HIM, ON HER RANCH. HE ACCEPTS THE JOB, NOT KNOWING THE RANCH IS FOR THE ""RECONDITIONING"" OF CAREER WOMEN: ACTRESSES, BUSINESS WOMEN, AND MODELS. WHILE HE'S THERE HE GETS INVOLVED WITH ""PAMELA MERITT"" WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR HER GRANDFATHER'S HIDDEN MONEY. SHE ONLY HAVE AN OLD LETTER THAT GIVES HER LITTLE OR NO DETAILS, EXCEPT THAT IT IS HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN AN OLD GHOST TOWN. APPARENTLY, SOMEONE ELSE IS ALSO INTERESTED IN PAM'S TALE OF HER GRANDFATHER'S TREASURE BECAUSE SHE IS ATTACKED TWICE AND RESCUED BOTH TIMES BY ""LONNIE"". ""LONNIE"" ALSO GETS HIMSELF INTO HOT WATER WHEN HE IS CONSTANTLY BREAKING INTO SONG EVERYTIME THE ""RANCH GUESTS"" ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING, SUCH AS A MASSAGE, OR A SWIMMING LESSON. ALL OF THE PERSONEL BEGAN COMPLAINING, BUT ""PAM"" SMOOTHS IT OUT FOR HIM TO ""VERA"" BUT THE OTHER PERSONEL STILL COMES DOWN HARD UNTIL ""VERA"" AGREES TO SPEAK WITH HIM ABOUT THE SITUATION. ""BRAD"" IS A BIT JEALOUS BECAUSE ALL OF THE LADIES ARE SMITTEN WITH ""LONNIE"", INCLUDING ""PAM"" WHOM HE SEEMS TO WANT HIMSELF. WHEN ""LONNIE"" GETS CAUGHT KISSING ""VERA RADFORD"", BY ""PAM"", SHE REFUSES TO SEE HIM ANYMORE. RODEO SEASON BEGINS AND ""LONNIE"" LEAVES THE RANCH TO CONTINUE ON WITH HIS PROFESSION, THAT OF A ""CHAMPION RODEO RIDER"". BUT HE CAN'T MAKE A DIME, BECAUSE HIS MIND IS ON ""PAM"". ""STANLEY"" SHOWS UP AT ONE OF THE RODEO LOCATIONS WHERE ""LONNIE"" WAS AND INFORMS HIM THAT ""PAM"" IS MISERABLE WITHOUT HIM, AND WHY HASN'T HE GOTTEN IN TOUCH WITH HER. ""LONNIE"" PULLS A LETTER OUT OF HIS POCKET AND SHOWS IT TO HIM INFORMING HIM THAT HE'S BEEN WRITING AND CALLING BUT ""PAM"" KEEPS HANGING UP ON HIM AND SENDING HIS LETTERS BACK. ""STANLEY"" THEN SUGGEST TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD JUST TELL HER OFF AND ""LONNIE"" AGREES AND RETURNS WITH ""STANLEY"" TO THE RANCH, ONLY TO CATCH ""PAM"" TRYING TO GET AWAY IN HER JEEP. THEY BOTH THEN PURSUE HER TO THE GHOST TOWN WHERE SHE HAD BEEN SNEAKING OFF TO, LOOKING FOR HER GRANDFATHER'S FORTUNE. (DOES ANYONE CATCH ""LONNIE"" LOOKING RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA, AS HE AND ""STANLEY CHARGES OFF IN HOT PURSUIT AFTER ""PAM""?)THEY ALL GET CAUGHT IN A FLASH FLOOD AND WIND UP HAVING TO SPEND THE NIGHT AT A RESTORED HOTEL. THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THE MEN WHO HAD TRIED TO KIDNAP ""PAM"" TO GET THE LETTER, LEADING TO HER GRANDFATHER'S FORTUNE, HAD FOLLOWED THEM TO THE GHOST TOWN TOO. A STRING OF COMEDIES THEN BEGIN TO HAPPEN. FIRST ""STANLEY"" ENCOUNTERS A ""GHOST"" IN A ROCKING CHAIR, WHO IN AN EERIE VOICE TELLS HIM TO GET OUT OF HIS ROOM, A SLIDING PANEL WHERE A FIST COMES OUT AND SOCKS HIM IN THE NOSE, AND GHOSTS AT HIS ROOM'S DOOR AND AT THE WINDOWS. ""LONNIE"" THEN GETS BUSY ANSWERING MANIACAL SCREAMS FROM BOTH ""PAM"" AND ""STANLEY"". ""PAM"" IS ONCE AGAIN ASSAULTED BY SOMEONE IN A GHOSTLEY MASK AND THE CONTENTS OF HER PURSE IS STOLEN. IT'S ""LONNIE"" TO THE RESCUE AGAIN, AS HE SHOWS HOW SKILLFUL OF A FIGHTER HE IS AND KNOCKS THE GUY OUT. IT TURNS OUT TO BE ""ADOLF"" THE CHEF AT ""VERA RADFORD'S"" RANCH. THEN PUTS AN END TO THE REST OF THE GHOSTLEY CLAN BY TRICKING THEM INTO FALLING INTO A MUD BATH, OBVIOUSLY AN UNFINISHED PART OF THE HOTEL. WHEN ""STANLEY"" ACCIDENTALLY FALLS THRU THE CEILING OF THE CELLAR, VIA STEPPING OUT OF THE SAME DOOR THAT LANDED THE ""GHOSTS"" INTO THE MUD BATH, LITTLE DID HE KNOW HE HAD FALLEN INTO WHERE THE ""TREASURE"" WAS. ""LONNIE"" AND ""PAM"" HURRIES TO HIS RESCUE, WHEN THEY SPOT A TRUNK WITH THE INITIALS ""MW"" ON IT. ""STANLEY"" PULLS A CROWBAR FROM THE WALL TO PRY OPEN THE TRUNK, PULLING A PIECE OF WALL AWAY, RELEASING THE MONEY FROM IT'S HIDING PLACE. THE SHERIFF THEN ARRIVES, DEMANDS THEY HAND OVER THE MONEY TO HIM. HE IS DISARMED WHEN ""PAM"" HITS HIM OVER THE HEAD, AND THE MOVIE ENDS WITH THEM GETTING MARRIED. ""STANLEY"" ACCIDENTALLY WINDS UP IN TOW, RIDING IN A BIG WASH TUB THAT WAS CONNECTED TO THE CAR, THAT HE HAD FALLEN INTO. ""LONNIE"" AND ""PAM"" ARE ENDS THE MOVIE WITH ONE OF HIS SONGS AND HE AND ""PAM"" RIDES OFF INTO THE SUNSET TO THEIR HONEYMOON. I GAVE THIS MOVE FOUR STARS BECAUSE IN MY OPINION IT IS ONE OF ELVIS BETTER ONE'S. I NOTICED ON THE LINER NOTES, IT CLAIMS THERE ARE TEN SONGS ON THE SOUNDTRACK. I HAVE ONLY COUNTED NINE.

On arrival he is pleasantly surprised to discover that it's a fat farm/retreat for a bevy of beautiful women. As I'm sure you guessed, he immediately becomes the most sought after commodity within a hundred mile radius.

Critique: The '65 release `Tickle Me' is your typical Elvis movie famous for there predictable storyline, atrocious acting, inane dialogue, schlock humor and extremely attractive women. See Elvis win the heart of many a fair maiden with his classic good looks, charming personality, manly fighting skills and incredible singing voice. However what sets this particular film apart from the rest of the herd of Elvis cinematic exploits is the presence of one of the most stunning beauties of the `60's, or any decade for that matter, the alluring, rarely seen Jocelyn Lane.

869043,3,6304402929,"First...and foremost...I'm an Elvis fan, and I mark his 30-year passing with fond memories and deep regret that he couldn't have lived a happier and more fulfilled life.

This is my favorite Elvis movie. I'm a big fan of Julia ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" Adams, and the concept of Elvis as a ranch hand on a dude ranch where there are only a couple of other dudes and a whole lot of Elvis-loving women is pretty hard to resist.

That said, I can't think of a single moment in this movie in which ""reality"" is reflected. Not One.

Even casual Elvis fans know that Col. Tom Parker (NOT a Colonel, NOT a Tom, NOT a Parker...REAL NAME Andreas Cornelis Dries van Kuijk...got FIFTY PERCENT of EVERYTHING Elvis made. From DAY ONE, Elvis was a CASH COW to the Colonel. The movies allowed him to ""double dip""...the price of a movie ticket, the price of a soundtrack album...and pay off his gambling debts (the extended engagements at the International Hotel in Vegas during the seventies were also orchestrated by ""Colonel Tom"" for the same reason).

Like it or not, even though Colonel Tom made bucketfuls of cash for The King, Elvis was a ""cash cow"" from DAY 1.

Elvis wanted to be an actor, but...as in EVERY OTHER PROFESSION...any move other than a LATERAL move must be earned. A gifted singer is not automatically a gifted actor. A gifted actor is not automatically a gifted singer. And so on...

I guess the dividing line between ""Elvis Fan"" and ""Elvis Fanatic"" lies between those who can call him a man who wanted to act and those who consider him a ""gifted actor."" I fall into the first category.

""Tickle Me"" is rife with pre-adolescent tomfoolery and just...plain...BAD...acting. Elvis, Elvis songs, gorgeous women, and ridiculous tripe that makes the worst Frankie Avalon & Annette Funicello movie look like KING---FREAKING---LEAR.

Elvis rips a couple of bluesy numbers...better than the average for an ""Elvis Movie""...but if I had to choose between this and the 1968 comeback special, my reaction is ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

Colonel Tom told Elvis to make movies, so he made movies. The purity and carnality and immediacy of the 1968 comeback special was the DIRECT result of Elvis challenging the Colonel...he wanted Elvis to sing ""Silent Night"" or some such treacle and look into the camera and say ""MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE""...and instead we got a black leather Elvis howling ""ONE NIGHT WITH YOU...""

And after that he went to Vegas and resumed following ""The Colonel's"" orders.

You all know that Robert Plant and Jimmy Page offered the services of Led Zeppelin as a backing band to Elvis for a ROCK ALBUM, right? If so, HOW can you watch ""Clambake"" and ""Tickle Me"" and ""Blue Hawaii"" and NOT feel a deep, deep sense of loss?

You all know that Bruce Springsteen got caught trying to jump the gates at Graceland, right? Can you...even for a moment...imagine a rock album from Elvis Presley and the E STREET BAND? CAN YOU???

Songs better than normal as they were not written specifically for the movie, and had been recorded in the ealy sixties.  Some of the sets a bit below par, but that was because the movie company was virtually bankrupt, (hence the reason for using previously recorded songs). The box office revenue saved the company for a few more years.  The last 20 minutes is a real hoot and in places will make you jump as people move around the creepy deserted hotel. The partnership between Elvis and his sidekick is very amusing in places.

869051,5,6304402929,"""Tickle Me"" might be underrated by movie censors, but it's funny, full of good songs, beautiful women, and some good fight scenes. Elvis is singing rodeo rider Lonnie Beale who, until the next rodeo season starts, is hired by Vera Radford (Julie Adams) who owns a spa/dude ranch called ""Circle 'Z'"". Lonnie takes an interest in the aerobics instructor Pam (Jocelyn Lane). Pam has a will that thugs are looking for because it is linked to $100,000 in gold left to her by her grandfather that is stored in a nearby ghost town. Lonnie is caught kissing the boss which upsets Pam. The next rodeo season begins. Lonnie can't keep it straight. After a long rodeo season, she still isn't speaking to him. Lonnie, Stanley (Jack Mullaney), and Pam end up at the ghost town and have to spen the night in the hotel. All night guys in goon masks, beast masks, a ghost in a rocker try to frighten away the hapless trio. They soon take down these thugs and learn they were from the ranch and were the suspicious ones. They find the money, and take down the sheriff who was behind it all. Lonnie and Pam marry in the end...with Stanley accidentally getting a free ride in the back of the jeep in the washtub.

869096,4,6304402929,"One of my guiltiest guilty pleasures, a flick with everything a perpetual adolescent craves: chicks in short shorts, hokey monsters, fisticuffs and more chicks in short shorts. As Lonnie Beale, a rodeo star turned  fat farm wrangler, Elvis gets wrapped up in a ""Scooby-Doo""-ish mystery involving a chilly exercise instructor (hubba-hubba Jocelyn Lane) and a lost fortune in gold. You know a movie's so bad it's good when the comic relief is provided by Jerry Lewis wannabe Jack Mullaney (a fave of mine from the forgotten TV sitcom ""It's About Time"").
Elvis sleepwalks through the flick, even when he's romancing Lane, one of the most delectable of his leading ladies, or being romanced by his somewhat older boss, Julie Adams, looking every bit as good as she did in ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" a decade earlier. The King doesn't even get all shook up by the bad guys in groovy monster masks and only seems to perk up in the obligatory fight scenes, where he gets to show off his manly-man karate moves.
The soundtrack is actually pretty good, featuring a couple of decent ballads (""I Feel that I've Known You Forever,"" ""Slowly but Surely"") and likeable rockers (""Nightrider,"" ""Dirty, Dirty Feeling""). And did I mention, there's lots of girls in short shorts?

Lonnie Beale (Elvis Presley) is a rodeo cowboy. He hits a town and gets a job at a dude ranch. He was disovered by a woman named Vera Radford (Julie Adams). She puts him in with a man named Stanley Potter (Jack Mullaney). Lonnie falls for another worker named Pam Merritt (Jocelyn Lane).
The staff complains to Vera when Lonnie starts singing and takes away the girls away from working with them. But when Pam catchs Lonnie kissing his boss, she gets mad with him. Turning the rodeo season, Lonnie calls Pam and hangs up on him. When Stanley shows up, he asks Lonnie why he hasn't been writing her, and Lonnie says ""What is this a ham sandwich?"" The letter got marked Return to Sender. But when Lonnie and Stanley find Pam they check into a hotel.

Elvis plays a hired hand at an all-girl dude ranch. Of course, he falls for one of the employees (the gorgeous Jocelyn Lane), and somehow the plot shifts over to  that of a buried treasure.
It's embarrassing to watch Elvis break into  song in the most redundant situations. The dialogue is SO bad, and the  acting leaves a lot to be desired.
The music is actually GOOD in this  picture. But, that's because the studio couldn't afford new songs to  record. The result: songs from Elvis' albums from 1960 to 1963. But, their  use in this picture is not done to their advantage.

Well, a few years back I gave it a second  chance and found it to be a well-put together, genuine slapstick comedy for  the whole family - not really: despite the middle-aged actors in ghost  getups and the many silly sight gags, it remains in the ""adult""  category (even though my Warner Home Video does not include the shocking  line I recall from earlier viewings). Anyway, the ladies-only health  spa/dude ranch setting leads to some fairly salty dialogue (one scene  involves an embrace with his boss Julie Adams, whose good performance also  has been overlooked, leading to an unusual Elvis audience aside, or camera  look, which is very interesting). The writers also give Elvis a chance to  kind of poke fun at his screen character: in an early scene he relates to a  bar owner that his job fell through and he's out of work. The guy reaches  for a GEEtar, hands it to Elvis, who says ""...I know"". It's  brilliant! Later in the film, in a nice dream sequence with Elvis and  Jocelyn Lane in old time Western gear, he AGAIN satirizes the proceedings.  These bits and pieces need to be noticed more. Yes, Elvis' comedic  abilities are well projected in this formula flick - it's his best comedy  acting since ""Follow That Dream"".",959126400,15,1626,4.698581560283688
869103,3,6304402929,"""Tickle Me"" remains one of the few Elvis pictures from the mid-60s which looks and sounds okay. Nothing great or startling here, just plenty of female flesh, a story of sorts about lost gold, complete with a  haunted house, and some good, if recycled, songs.
Elvis looks good as a  rodeo rider trying to impress Jocelyn Lane, while getting into romantic  trouble with an older woman. The setting for ""I'm Yours"" is  nicely choreographed. A good film for the kids on a wet Saturday afternoon.",939600000,4,491,4.741176470588235

7870553,4,6304402929,"I actually purchased this DVD as a gift, but remember seeing the movie when it played in the theatre. It was the only Elvis Presley movie I liked. Good cast with Elvis - Jack Mullaney (It's About Time), Julie Adams (Creature From the Black Lagoon), Bill Williams (Kit Carson), Ed Faulkner (McClintock). It will be more fun for me to watch this movie now as I have met Ed Faulkner several times at Western Legends Roundup in Kanab Utah (held every August).",1508284800,,455,4.560975609756097
