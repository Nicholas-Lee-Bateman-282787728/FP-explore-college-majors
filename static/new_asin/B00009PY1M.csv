7992678,5,B00009PY1M,"""Yoga for Urban living is designed to work around your schedule."" ~Hemalaya Behl

Hemalaya Behl's Yoga workouts allow you to create your very own yoga sanctuary. Her workouts embody the spirit of yoga. The blue walls speak of emotional stability and the wood floors and plants place an emphasis on natural materials.

While this workout is for mornings, I find it is perfect any time of the day when you have 40 minutes to enjoy a yoga escape.

I first did this workout when I was cooking Indian food and the entire experience was very authentic. I would also recommend the use of a rose oil to balance the mood and encourage beauty.

The exercises start with ""OM"" and as the word vibrates through your entire being, you will quickly abandon all worry and fear and sink into a state of serenity. There are a few gentle neck stretches and then you breathe away your tension and stress.

I think you can enjoy this workout even more if you place a blanket on the floor and then put your yoga mat on top of the blanket. Then, fold a towel in half and place it in the middle of your mat. This gives you more ""comfort"" during your workout. I find it is easy to move the towel, but I really enjoy the feeling of a soft towel under my feet instead of always feeling the cold ""plastic"" feel of the yoga mat.

Hemalaya Behl has a very casual approach. In fact, she is talking you through the entire workout ""from a distance."" She doesn't actually speak during the workout, but her calming voice drifts in and out of the soundtrack. There is an interesting ""rotation"" segment and a ""sun salutation series"" in which she is rather good about telling you what you will do next. If you are finely tuned and ready to move as soon as an instructor tells you what you will be doing next, relax into this calming series of exercises. There is no rush, no place to go, just breathe.

While doing the spine twists, I suddenly realized I was going much deeper into the poses than I had on other yoga workouts. I think you relax so much, that you can go deeper. You will recognize positions like triangle, plow, down dog and cobra. Hemalaya also includes a variety of authentic moves and creative poses. I find her instruction style to be very calming and she has a beautiful spirit.

The pace is just slow enough to relax and just fast enough so you don't get bored. If you are intermediate or advanced, you can always add in a few of your own poses here and there. ""Morning Quickie"" will encourage joint flexibility and will heat and energize the body. I can't wait to try ""Evening Bath.""

I really hope she is intending to make more yoga for urban living workouts. How about ""Laying out in the Sun,"" ""Waking up to Yoga in Bed,"" ""A Walk Next to the Ocean,"" ""Island Escape,"" ""Sunrise/Sunset,"" ""Sunny Mood - in which she could actually wear that orange outfit,"" ""Winter Escape,"" and ""Sailing into Peace."" I could think up more, but I think I've made my point. I really would like to see more Hemalaya Behl workouts. They are unique, authentic yoga escapes.

7992679,4,B00009PY1M,"This video delivers what it promises:  it provides an energizing yoga practice to wake you up in the morning or to refresh you at any time of the day.  The workout begins with gentle, non-yoga stretches focused on increasing the blood flow to various parts of the body.  Instructor Hemalaya also incorporates a few exercises not generally found on other yoga tapes:  she engages in both brief chanting and ""energized breathing.""  The main section of this practice consists of a series of sun salutations; each series becomes a bit more challenging, eventually incorporating standing poses.  The practice ends with a relaxation which includes a few additional ""omm"" chants.
The music on this video is quiet and pleasant with sort of a tribal theme (similar to Minna Lessig's ""Strength and Grace""), and the studio setting is designed to look like a comfy loft apartment.  Hemalaya has a pleasant voice and offers good general instruction, but there are two main problems with her cuing:  1) her voice over instructions are often out of sync with her camera performance of the poses, and 2) when she cues right and left, she is inconsistent about using mirrored instructions.  Despite these flaws, this is an enjoyable yoga practice which provides a nice change from some of the other available videos.",1062979200,3,1299,5.004651162790697
