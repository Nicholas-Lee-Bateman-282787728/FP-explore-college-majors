Together with George Cooper, Buck Jones is clowning his way through this picture and it is actually very funny. I didn't know Jones had this talent too. He can really look like a shameful child when he has said or done something stupid. Frank Rice delivers a loveable old sheriff of the town. And in spite of all the comedy we are not in lack of fast riding and shooting. Can't be better!",1363564800,,518,4.295918367346939
