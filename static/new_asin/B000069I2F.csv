1732557,5,B000069I2F,"We were hooked on the ups and downs of each of the characters in this old BBC Series. Some people moved on to be replaced by others, to keep the story interesting.

For Americans, turn on the American/English subtitles. The original audience was Scottish, not American.

I felt a little heart sick when we watched the last episode of season 7.",1354924800,3,343,4.60655737704918
1732558,5,B000069I2F,I loved this program when it was on TV and disappointed when it was taken off the air.  I was very glad to find this whole series at a reasonable price.  Quality of service was excellent and package was received within time frame specified.,1329091200,,240,4.431818181818182
1732559,5,B000069I2F,"What a delightful series set in Scotland, a country I love to tour.  I'm sure others will enjoy the series as I have.",1265587200,,117,4.086956521739131
1732560,5,B000069I2F,"Having watched this wonderful series from the BBC here on PBS, I can tell you that this is a terrific show - with a great mix of character development, comedy, and romance . . . all with the beautiful backdrop of the Scottish Highlands scenery !  GREAT family -oriented entertainment.",1083024000,7,284,4.68
1732561,5,B000069I2F,"With Vol. 1 & 2 in my video library, I have become a true fan of this series.  The beautiful landscape of Scotland has arrested my heart.  We are invited into the lives of modern day Scottish royalty, with all of the current life challenges, showing a wounded son who returns to his family home to rescue them out of financial problems; the development of his relationships with the people of the community in which he has become Laird (much like being an English Lord), a role he had not planned to play; the separation from his newly opened restaurant business in London and his prior love relationship; restoration of the father-son dynamic; and his search to find ways to restoring financial solvency; and the development of feelings for another, are challenges that have become grist for the success of this series.
I am currently on the waiting list for Vol. 3 to come out in 2003, and I can hardly wait until that anticipated day when the postman arrives with the package.  If you like stunning scenery; the terseness of the human dynamic; and the sense of a new horizen, I strongly suggest that you begin to add Monarch of the Glen to your video library.",1042761600,8,1162,4.603864734299517
7965628,5,B000069I2F,Absolutely loved the series. Had a chance to go to Scotland this month and every time I saw a manor house/ inhabited castle I had to smile. The characters are well developed and the balance between humor and pathos is well maintained. Definitely could be a bright spot in your day if you decide to watch. A genuinely gifted cast. Give it a try!,1492214400,,344,4.390625

7965632,3,B000069I2F,"Comes out of the gate well but, as quite often is the case, it falters mid-course. I still can't bring myself to watch the last three seasons so that must tell you something.",1439337600,,174,4.303030303030303

7965634,1,B000069I2F,Can't watch on regular DVD player.  Spent a bunch of money for nothing.,1413763200,,71,4.461538461538462
7965635,3,B000069I2F,"Well the dvd's read as bad disk for any of our more advanced tv's forget about it playing on a lap top. Didn't play for an old Mac and didn't play for a Aries or a toshiba laptop, will not work in a blue ray disk player which can usually play anything.  Love the monarch of the glen the scripts truffles were fruatraition. But the characters were awesome. Wish it didn't have to end.  So the movie is 5 stars the company is two so I give it a 3",1412467200,,444,3.922222222222222
7965636,4,B000069I2F,"Actually, I'd give the first four seasons a 5, and the last two a three. The series falls off rapidly after Archie and Lexie depart, most with a line or two of dialogue and no convincing reasons for their departure. You can only assume the actors got tired. I missed the whimsey of Julian Fellowes when he left, too - especially after his inspiring tango with Susan Hampshire. But Fellowes developed another gig to keep him happy: Downton Abbey. One could only wish for a new series with all the principals of this lovely if uneven series, and the spectacular Scottish highlands for a background. It's certainly worth spending an hour or two escaping into their world. If you think they exaggerate the difficulty of keeping an estate going, look around your local farming area, and count the corn mazes and petting zoos.",1412208000,,820,4.741258741258742
7965637,2,B000069I2F,"When we received the product and tried to play it we could not. It was a format that can only be viewed in the PAL format which is okay if you live in Britain. Fortunately, the seller allowed us to return the product and we received a credit.",1368057600,,242,4.0625
