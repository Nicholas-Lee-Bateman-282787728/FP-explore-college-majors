I don't think the attitudes in the movie are really very healthy for young people.

8064755,4,B0009PLMB2,"It has been over a decade since I have watched the original three OAV's (originally released by US Manga Corps in the early 90's; based on clips compiled from the original television series) of the anime ""AREA 88"".

  The story of ""AREA 88"" revolves around Shin Kazama.  A pilot with a great future with Yamato Air Lines.  He's engaged to marry with his boss's daughter, Ryoko.

  Everything looks good for Shin until his friend Satoru Kanzaki gets him drunk and signs his life away to enlist with the Aslam Foreign Legion (AFL).

  Now Shin Kazama is a pilot that is on daily missions to kill other pilots and destroy enemy headquarters to live.

  Shin is now living a life where the only way to get out of the AFL is to get enough kills to buy your way out (US $1.5 million), survive until your term is up or escape (which usually leads to death).

  Over 15 years later, a new television series featuring the adventures of Shin Kazama is now available on DVD courtesy of ADV Films.

  The first volume features three episodes with a new storyline slightly different from the manga and original anime series.

  With more characters introduced in the new anime series, one is Makoto Shinjou.  A photographer who is on a mission to take a photo of the face of a dead Shin Kazama.  A mission that was given to him none other than by Shin's nemesis Kanzaki.

  Of course, Shinjou doesn't know the history between Shin and Kanazaki but nevertheless, the storyline now incorporates this character to show how the toll of war and destruction are affecting the pilots and those who live at the Aslam Foreign Legion headquarters.

  The first episode introduces several characters from the new television series as well as reacquaints us with Shin and friends.

  The second episode features a storyline of AFL pilot Boris, the Angel of Death.

  The third episode features Shin and the young pilot Kim as they go on a mission where Shin nearly dies and how it almost affects him.
  The DVD features the video in anamorphic widescreen and the English dub is in 5.1 and Japanese dialogue in 2.0.

  DVD special features include production sketches, character and aircraft specs, clean opening/closing animation and a feature not listed on the DVD but is included is an interview with the director Isamu Imakake and screenwriter Hiroshi Ohnogi.

  ""Area 88"" is an action anime.  Following the aerial action scenes of popular films such as ""Top Gun"", ""Area 88"" incorporates that action by showing battles between Shin and friends versus the enemy.

  But the storyline that wins me over is the perspective as seen by photographer Makoto Shinjou.

  Shinjou comes off as a pompous photographer but you get to see him change from episode-to-episode as he starts to learn about the pilots and most notably, as he starts to slowly learn about the man he is to photograph dead.

  ""Area 88"" has always been a series that I have always loved.  From reading the original Japanese manga to playing the video game available on the old SNES console, the anime has a storyline that will hook you in.

  Most of all, you watch because the TV series show you with each episode of how Shin Kazama goes through Hell and back as a pilot of the Aslam Foreign Legion and living for his Ryoko and to get revenge on Kanzaki.  I can't wait to see that happen!",1218585600,2,3330,4.649395509499136
8064756,2,B0009PLMB2,"Makoto Shinjo is a war photographer that shows no fear when it comes to capturing the essence of his subject, even if his life is on the line. He's come to the desert of Aslan to document the lives and battles of the mercenary pilots fighting against anti-government forces. It's pretty easy to sign up as a mercenary but very hard to get out after you agree to a 3 year tour of duty. You can break the contract early IF you pay the sum of 1.5 million dollars. Even though the pilots are paid very well for every enemy they shoot down and various missions they fly, they are also required to pay for room and board, food, weapons, and maintenence of their aircraft. So it's very hard for them to save up any amount of money. And that's just how the government forces like it. To have the mercenaries underfoot and in debt. Even if they allow them to break the contract they still get a million dollars to hire another one. Makoto is focused on one pilot in particular, Shin Kazama, the only Japanese pilot on the base, and one of the most enigmatic. He doesn't have much to say but he is possibly the best flyer of the whole group. The only things we know about him is that he is utterly miserable working for Aslan and is desperate to get back to a woman in Japan.

As is the problem for most first volume anime dvds that only contain 3 episodes, there is a shortage of material to truly judge the merit of the series. If you enjoyed movies like Top Gun or Stealth or the anime Yukikaze, you'll most likely enjoy Area 88. If dogfighting jets are not your cup of tea, then you would do best to avoid Area 88. The jets are all CG and look quite nice, if a little cold and flimsy, but they make you feel at times as if you are watching a promo video for the latest Ace Combat videogame. The main characters are not given enough space in these episodes to breath and show much individuality. That was Volume 1's main weakness. We don't learn enough about the characters to care about their dreams or hopes for the future or the extreme dangers they find themselves in. I will wait till I watch the other volumes before making an overall judgement about the series.",1206748800,,2161,4.296568627450981
8064757,4,B0009PLMB2,"So I've been a big fan of Area 88 ever since the original anime came out in the 80's. It had a gripping plotline, superb character development, and great combat scenes. Too bad they made only one of the three volumes into a DVD.

I was extremely elated at the news that ADV films was going to remake Area 88. After I watched the entire series, I must admit that I was a little disappointed, but found it still very entertaining to watch, and that's the reason why I still give it a 4.

There were a couple of things about the new series that I did not like. First of all, the original series was rated MA, meaning it was meant for the mature viewers. The blood, violence, nudity, and language all added to the dark, desperate tone of the original series. However, with the new Area 88 series, the rating was a TVPG. Not even a TV PG-13. Wow, this change took a lot out from what I believe the original creator had intended. I felt like it was a watered-down version of the original series.

Secondly, the new series had new characters and left out some of the old characters from the original series. I actually liked the new characters a lot. They added a lot to the plot and discreetly revealed some key elements about the main character, Shin Kazama. However, the mere fact that some of the original characters were taken out infuriated me. They had contributed so much in terms of character development and unfolding of some of the mysteries in the story.

Having said that, I do not want to judge this series in comparison to the original series. Instead, I rate it on its own at 4.

I still recommend watching this anime. It's a great series.",1150934400,,1648,4.390163934426229
