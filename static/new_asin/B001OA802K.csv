Some people might be deterred by the subject material but if you can get past it you will find a very well produced and directed film with fine performances by everybody. I was especially struck by the looks and acting prowess of Chitrangada Singh.  I wonder why we don't see more of her.  Kudos everyone.  I want to see more of such bold efforts in Bollywood.",1348704000,,464,4.411764705882353
8330018,4,B001OA802K,"Sharman Joshi is someone who I have come to look upon as a talented actor. His uncanny ability to deliver comedy effortlessly both impresses and surprises me. Boman Irani and Shabana have real chemistry. They are not just bystanding, intervening, stereotypical Hindi-film parents. They are integral to the storyline. Chitrangada Singh has not had to try hard to look gorgeous. No crazy mind-numbing sets or bolly-typical dresses to insult one's taste and intelligence. No boorish loud mouths filling the gaps in creativity, or tear jerking long drawn out funerals and death scenes. These folks looked like real people with real lives that people identify and connect with. Songs are well chosen and well blended and do not stick out like a sore thumb breaking the continuity of narrative. I wanted to listen to more of its music after the film was over. I attribute a large part of the success of its music to KK's Mere Khuda. Joyful experience. Would like to see more of Hindi films along the same lines.",1301961600,,1005,4.883040935672515
8330019,4,B001OA802K,"This is more a Western style movie. No dances (unless you count some movement accompanying the final credits) and music used as soundtrack rather than sung (or mimed). The music is jazz-based early in the movie (not my style) but moves to something more of romantic hindi- type. I did find the music unmemorable.
This movie is about a young man who is marrying his girlfriend of 5 years in Mauritius. He hasn't been home to India during that time. His younger brother and parents come to meet the girl for the first time and be there for the wedding.
It turns out that the guy getting married has become more focused on his work and getting ahead and is constantly leaving his fiancee in the company of his family before the wedding. His brother and the fiancee fall in love and the movie is about how this is resolved.
Mauritius looks beautiful and the cinematography is slick. The acting and scripting are well executed, and there is generally good connection between the actors (particularly those playing the parents).
This was all well done and I would have preferred to give it a 3 1/2.
I must say that for all the positives that I found it a bit unengaging and almost ordinary.
There was also a small problem in that the younger brother preferred to the fiancee looks too young for the girl and they accentuate this by her talking of him as being a bit of a big kid and how she may have to play Mum to him.  So this couple didn't quite make sense emotionally to either of us two viewers at the time (and in fact my adult daughter got bored and abandoned the movie half way through)
So it's a romance, a sort of (not too serious drama) and not a musical. It is recent and modern looking and more Western in style. It's not really arty- though the art house set would probably prefer this to more fantasy and sentimental Bollywood offerings (which I like myself).
All of this is to say that how you'll find it depends what you are into. The most common ratings on Bollywood sites tend to range between 3 and 4 (out of 5).
This is well done and I thought it a reasonable way to spend time but I won't bother revisiting it.",1234224000,,2126,4.3686868686868685
