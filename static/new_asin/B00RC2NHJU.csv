8694804,4,B00RC2NHJU,"Crux is a well-done reflective movie featuring scenes in and around Milwaukee Wisconsin.  The narrator, who is Bishop Hying, encourages us to reflect on the fact that without God, our life is meaningless--what we have here is all there is, and once it is over, there is nothing more.  Bishop Hying also points out that without God, we have to be God in our lives, always right, always strong.  The main thing that struck me was when Bishop Hying said that most of the time if we are worried or regretful, it is because we are trying to live in the past or the future; most of the time the present is good, and we should appreciate that.

This film is the first in a series.  They are all short; this one is about twelve minutes long and I think they would be good to use  with an adult or young adult prayer group.  The material (at least in Crux) is more reflective than instructional and is followed with the discussion questions listed above in italics.

I'd like to thank Catholic Word for providing a complimentary review copy.  Grade:  B+",1421452800,,1044,4.447368421052632
