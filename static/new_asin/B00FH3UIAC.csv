8615751,5,B00FH3UIAC,"I always wonder when I see one star reviews. When it comes to Christian movies many complain about the acting, but this one featured Charlene Tilton, a seasoned and very talented actress. It seems many of the negatives are from men, and coincidentally this movie portrays at least a couple of them in a very negative light. You have to pay close attention to this movie about the filming of a documentary, as its filmed somewhat in the style of American Graffiti. I thought it was excellent, and I'm glad I watched it.",1514073600,2,518,4.580645161290323
8615752,5,B00FH3UIAC,"It tries to be a serious movie but the acting, writing, and plot are so terrible that I could not stop laughing throughout the movie.

It's sort-of like how Batman & Robin was hilarious.

 Amazingly low budget.",1497398400,,210,4.621621621621622
8615753,2,B00FH3UIAC,"Tried sitting through this for an hour, but it was poorly written and dragged on and on. The acting was horrible.",1485388800,,113,4.428571428571429
8615754,1,B00FH3UIAC,"I found this ""documentary"" confusing.  Actors played the family roles and much of the acting was inept.  I thought this ""documentary"" was going to feature real people and situations, as documentaries do.  No, this is a poorly staged fictional script.  Cannot recommend it to anyone.",1485129600,,282,5.2
