7932166,3,B000056AVI,"Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace was originally filmed in Germany. Actually, I would have been happier if they just kept the original German accents and used captions throughout the entire movie. Instead you have these horrible American voice overs who don't in the least bit try and sound British. It just gives the movie this really weird ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" feeling to it. The bright spot that makes this movie worth getting is seeing Christopher Lee in the role of Sherlock Holmes. Previously appearing as Sir Henry Baskerville in Hammer's version of ""The Hound of the Baskerville"" alongside Peter Cushing who played Sherlock Holmes in that film. After seeing Christopher Lee as Dracula, it was kind of hard to imagine him as Sherlock Holmes. But he really seems right in the role. Only a few times has an actor seemed unfit for the role of Sherlock Holmes. Matt Fewer comes to mind. The plot of the movie itself is very loosely based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story ""The Valley of Fear"". For those who are looking for something spectacular, I would advise you to steer clear. But for those of you who are curious about this somewhat forgotten Sherlock Holmes movie, I would recommend you buy a copy.",1006041600,4,1220,4.759433962264151
