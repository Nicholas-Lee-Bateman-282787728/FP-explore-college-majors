8757374,2,B01DYZ6QO6,"I purchased this video to show to patients on a psychiatric unit at a hospital. What I was hoping for was a video detailing how mental illness affects the brain both from a medical standpoint and a psychological one. Instead the beginning halve of the video focuses heavily on neurotransmitters and brain function there was not information that would really help someone with mental illness. The second half of the video is old, really old I believe the 1950's it shows a man being place in a psych hospital and the treatment he receives but considering how dated the setting was it would also not be much help to modern day individuals I am probably going to return this video do not buy it the brief length is not excuse for the lack of substantive content",1465516800,,758,4.580882352941177
