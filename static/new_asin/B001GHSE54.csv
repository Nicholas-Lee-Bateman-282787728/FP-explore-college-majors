The core cast does a good job of keeping things moving and the addition of scream queens like Linnea Quigley and Debbie Rochon are more than welcome. Tiffany Shepis' sex/death scene definitely steals the show but there are a few other scenes that come close. It has a similar story of a wild vacation gone wrong along the lines of Hostel and Hatchet but doesn't quite hit the gore level of those films. The Louisiana backdrop really sets an appropriate tone, with everything from swamps to the French Quarter, giving it the vibe of a true southern horror film. Lloyd Kaufman's cameo seems unnecessary but the goth guy in the cemetery...now that's class! ""Whatever, slut of darkness""",1484092800,,796,4.77536231884058
