615218,5,6303284183,"Finally, page and plant reunite to do an MTV unledded...I would not have missed this for the world. Led Zeppelin was gone before I every had a chance to see them, this allowed me that oppertunity.  Like everyone else,  I too was waiting. The egyptian players are fantastic, and page and plate  are great. Gallow Pole is a rocker, and you will find that the part you  never heard in Thank You is original, it is on  BBC release.  I am excited  to add info to one of the greatest rock bands ever.  I too wish JPJ and  Jason could have been there. scott Humphrey",926812800,,559,4.247619047619048
615219,5,6303284183,"Let's put it this way; We never thought it would happen. And sure it would of been nice to see John Paul Jones in there, but nonetheless, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant are not only back, they are back in style. From the  Morracan ensemble to the new bassist and drummer, Unledded is what any Zep  fan has been waiting 15 years for. If you haven't seen this tape, GET IT!",925689600,4,368,4.169014084507042
615220,5,6303284183,"A must have for any Led Zeppelin fan, No Quarter displays the long-awaited reunion of guitarist Jimmy Page and vocalist Robert Plant, members of arguably the greatest rock and roll band ever.  Backed by an Egyptian  orchestra on several tracks and talents Michael Lee, on drums, and Charlie  Jones, on bass, the two legends revisit and revise such classics as  Kashmir, The Rain Song, and Thank You, and also introduce new material,  including standouts like Wonderful One and City Don't Cry.  Both nostalgic  and ground breaking, it is no wonder this performance broke rating records  with it's MTV debut.",912470400,,606,5.05050505050505

615371,5,6303284183,I purchased the No Quarter DVD and also the CD (separately). Good stuff. I was disapointed that the CD did not have the Rain Song as it is one of the best versions of this classic that was featured on the DVD. I hope the CD and DVD at some point are reissued with double box sets that contain more from these No Quarter concerts.,1497744000,,329,4.076923076923077

615610,4,6303284183,"There's a lot to like, even love, in this DVD.  Some great old Led Zep music mostly, and Jimmy Page never sounding better.  Plus a whole lot of various ingenious arrangements and additions of a multitude of different instrumentation.  The main thing lacking here is the driving vocals of Robert Plant.  He was in his mid-forties when this concert movie, so to speak, was originally filmed, and his voice had lost a lot of its power, intensity, virtuosity and range.  He's a kinder, gentler Robert Plant.  On some songs his driving vocals are less missed.  Kashmir and Since I've Been Loving You are two good examples.

After I watched it, I had to put on the Led Zeppelin double DVD of Led Zep in their prime.  That's what I really wanted.",1448064000,,739,4.580152671755725

615612,5,6303284183,"In the early 70's, my first boyfriend quickly whisked me away from mainstream radio to everything BUT what was on the radio and, for that, I thank him (Zappa, et al) but as I spin into my 50's, I finally am back with my early 70's roots (sparked by my new husband, who I claim is the marriage of Plant/Clapton as far as guitar goes) and once I re-watched ""The Song Remains the Same"" (as awful as that is compared to todays video technology), something 'happened' and I have been enthralled since.

This album/CD is about the closest to perfection as it gets as far as getting the 'best' of Zeppelin but with that soul-inspiring Indian-esque spice.

I can't tell you how many times I've played this in the last 3 months but it comes into my dreams...perhaps the influence of my early 70's love telling me that 'commercial radio' was 's***'.  I don't know.  I only know that since I have been re-visiting Led Zeppelin,and found THIS gem, that I will never be the same.  I only wish my brain had been functioning on this level when the 'No Quarter' tour was circling.... one of my deepest life regrets.",1446768000,,1099,4.475

615825,5,6303284183,"Thank God Jimmy and Robert cataloged their work for antiquity in such a moving, beautifully spiritual manner.  To see such great musicians working their craft with some of the most accomplished musicians in the world, with the N. African influence shines a light into the musical souls of these gifted individuals.  Loved by fans worldwide, but never given the due credit in media circles, this performance deserves a fresh look at the band that changed rock and roll music and once again moves the bar with this stirring performance.  A must have for the true Led Zeppelin fan and collector.

I would be remiss if I didn't also mention and give credit to the quality of this production, musically as well as the video production, playlist and locales in which it took place.  All brought together with skillful editing and musical mastering, creating fresh texture and color to the music of these artists that makes their music timeless.  Talk about Swan Song!!!  Bravo and ""Thank You"" Jimmy and Robert from all your fans worldwide for this meaningful performance.",1410566400,,1065,4.949438202247191

I can not remember ever being so blown away as I was when I first heard this work, as the tunes get literally burned into your head. You end up laying in bed pleading for the songs to leave your brains so you can sleep. The blending of these two musical legends with brilliant foreign musicians brings a totally new dimension to the songs most people have known and loved.  If you sit back relaxed and turn up the video, you will be carried away on a musical journey second to none.",1409961600,,639,4.195121951219512

If you are expecting the old Led Zeppelin, forget it. This performance, with the addition of the orchestra and middle eastern musicians, blew me away. The old songs evolving, changing into something different but just the same. My hats off to Plant and Page.",1398297600,,584,4.416666666666667

Add  a quartet of Moroccan players, a full complement of strings from the London Metropolitan Orchestra and a host of Egyptian percussion and strings.

For my money ""Rain Song"" with a full orchestra was the way god intended this song to be performed and worth the price of the DVD by itself.  With all of the bonus material, this DVD is a great buy for the Led Zeppelin fan!",1383868800,7,679,4.540983606557377

It doesn't seem to pick up until the halfway point with The Rain Song and That's the Way. If your a fan, then definitely worth a look and listen, but I wasn't as impressed as others with the Mid-East flavor.

616024,5,6303284183,"Jimmy Page and Robert Plant met in 1968 and hit it off when they discovered they shared unorthodox and wide-ranging musical interests. Despite Led Zeppelin's reputation as the founding fathers of heavy metal, real fans know that what made Zep unique was the variety of musical styles deployed in their compositions. Ideas from North African and Indian music (check out Page's frequently unconventional guitar tunings) as well as Mississippi Delta blues, Appalachian mountain music and the folk traditions of the British Isles all fed into the Zeppelin song book.

The 1994 reunion between Page and Plant was sparked by an invitation to perform together on MTV's `Unplugged' series, and by music producer Bill Curbishley talking Robert Plant around to the idea (Page needed no persuasion).

The resulting concert at the studios of London Weekend Television (LWT) forms the centrepiece of this DVD which captures and celebrates the `Unledded' project. `No Quarter' contains 17 musical pieces performed either at the LWT concert, or outside in the open air in North Wales, or under the hot sun in Morocco with a group of Arab musicians. Four of the pieces - `City Don't Cry', `The Truth Explodes', `Wah Wah' and `Wonderful One' - are non-Zeppelin compositions, the rest imaginative re-works of songs written jointly by Page and Plant and originally recorded by Zeppelin in the 1970s.

The new arrangements are backed by 7 musicians playing banjo, mandolin, bodhran and hurdy-gurdy as well as bass and percussion. To add further spice to the mix a traditional Egyptian 11-piece musical ensemble is deployed on many of the tracks and on those recorded in Marrakech, a group of Moroccan musicians. To top it all off, the entire string section from The London Metropolitan Orchestra (violins, violas and cellos) guest on `Since I've been loving you' and a brand new extended interpretation of the Zep classic `Kashmir' which is the DVD's crowning moment and closes the show.

Most buyers interested in this collection will be Zeppelin fans and very familiar with all the originals from Zep's back catalogue. The reworks of for example `Nobody's fault but mine', `Four Sticks' and `Friends' are transformed into exotic rhythmic excursions so radically different to the Zeppelin originals as to be barely recognisable. Other numbers enjoy less radical reworks but are improved nevertheless.

The inclusion of so many other fine musicians with no previous connection to the world of western rock music offers an unexpectedly rich musical experience, more complex and varied than any one of Zeppelin's glorious albums to which this collection will inevitably be compared. This is a mature and interesting piece of work which will appeal to any Zeppelin fan and to any open-minded listener with wider musical horizons. Production values are exemplary, giving a rich and satisfying sound where no instrument or voice dominates the action, but where everything is in fine balance.

The extras include an interview with Page and Plant filmed in monochrome on a busy London Street (odd idea, but it somehow works even with people walking in front of the cameras and buses going past); a version of `Black Dog' radically changed from the original with an underlying `Whole Lotta Love' riff performed for the ABC American Music Awards; and an arty music video called `Most High'. Subtitles are offered in all major languages.",1369526400,,3407,5.174228675136116

Throw in a bunch of unique instruments and musicians, exotic settings and the amazing talent of Page and Plant you've got yourself one very special viewing experience.

As the title indicates, this is a mostly acoustic performance, featuring a string ensemble and a variety of Middle Eastern influences perfectly woven into the classics.  Plant's voice is in excellent form, Page is on fire and the late drummer Michael Lee is flawless.

The performance of ""Kashmir"" at the end is mesmerizing and epic (seriously, prepare for chills) but all of the songs are performed in such a way to almost make it feel like you're hearing that song again for the first time.  Battle of Evermore gets an impressive spin with the Hurdy Gurdy intro and sublime vocals by Najma Akhtar, When The Levee Breaks gets a facelift and The Rain Song and That's The Way are goosebump-inducing.  Being that this is not on Blu-Ray, it's not necessary to have the best flat screen around to enjoy this performance but having a home audio system with a soundbar and/or subwoofer and decent speakers will allow you to experience the music properly.",1365033600,,1059,4.899441340782123

A couple of their songs are recorded in Wales one of which is ""Nobodys Fault But Mine."" Just plane fun, fun, fun. The rest of the DVD is in a venue backed by London Metropolitan Orchestra. Fabulous combination I would have never thought would happen. The best part is ""Four Sticks"" and ""Kashmir"" with the Egyptian Ensemble.

616230,5,6303284183,"No point in saying I agree with most of the reviewers who found this DVD excellent, but the first time I listened to it, I picked the Dolby Stereo and put it on the big audio-rig and speakers -- the heck with five-channel sound when the stereo is this good. I then sat back and closed my eyes to focus on the music at its best. I have been a LZ fan for years, and I own many of their albums in original LP form, but this is amazing. The ""Rain Song"" has always been my favorite number . . . along with Kashmir, and I can say I never really heard them until this DVD.

After listening to CDs, this was sheer ear-ecstasy. The DVD audio quality is simply superb -- the best live recording I have ever seen/heard on DVD . . . and at last the medium lives up to its promise. The combination of watching the picture and listening to the gorgeous music is informing -- I figured out some things. Stereo imaging was highly synchronized with what your eyes see on the picture of the stage. EDIT -- the one glaring exception is ""Black Dog"", which is like listening to a ""boom box"" in a 55 gallong drum cranked up to unintelligible and frighening gains. I checked it out on a waveform analysis. There are no peaks; there are no valleys. This is a disappointment to a great song -- what you can credibly hear of the performance ""in the drum"" sounds as if it could have been a fine performance.

Sure, Robert Plant has lost some of the top end of his vocal range, but his unique phrasings and modulations are excellent, emotive and uniformly on key. He certainly is not shy of showing off that he is still quite a showman. And as for Jimmy Page, for the first time to me he shows he was not only a great innovator of the past, but he is still a consumate guitarist.

The imagination and reach of the arrangements left me awestruck at the extension of the creativity of Plant and Page. The choice of instrumentation and the superb blending of the various elements is among the most amazing recordings of a live performance I've ever heard. This is the audio fulfilment of my years of fandom of LZ. Sure, I think it's a tragedy that Bonham is no longer with us, and it's a disappointment if they slighted Jones, BUT this is a DVD I will use to demonstrate what great sound can be.

I thought the soundstage was beautiful and effective. The alternative recording sites and landscape interludes were pleasant and soothing, and they did not repeat the self-indulgence that mars ""The Song Remains the Same"" DVD.

EDIT: To rehash, I'd like to see whoever engineered that recording of ""Black Dog"" shot -- the gain and compression are so high that the average loudness is universally at the clipping point. It sounds horrible, and the better your sound system, the worse it sounds. Plant's vocals are muddied and some interesting Moroccan or Egyptian accompanyment is totally buried. It is the worst version of an LZ song I have ever heard by a member of the band, and is guaranteed to really iritate anyone quickly, if you can stand it that long.",1249776000,5,3024,4.402504472271914
616231,5,6303284183,"Robert Plant and Jimmy Page take the songs of Led Zeppelin and play them acoustically for the most part but also in a different thrust than the original. It's hard to find the words to describe what they did really... it's just so different than what you'd expect... and yet so tasty!

Much of the playing is set in India and they use Indian musicians and instruments behind them. It creates a very listenable quality to what you are seeing and hearing. When you relax into it a bit, the songs begin to get to you at a different level. I've done quite a bit of foreground listening in my life where I'm really immersed in the music and this one sort of gets in your mental kitchen and rearranges the furniture.

Also some great art direction and cinematography help create a visual atmosphere that matches the audio feel nicely.

And then there's those Zeppelin tunes....

If you liked them as originally done, you'll very much enjoy this slightly different take on their studio nature. What I particularly liked was that they didn't change the songs so much that you lose what you loved about them in the first place... and, as Martha Stewart would say, ""That's a good thing.""",1241395200,,1177,4.59047619047619
616232,5,6303284183,"From the offset, this is probably the least impressive Led Zeppelin product that I own.  Opening scenes are of scenery and nature, eagles crying, rivers; then, at the top of a waterfall, there appear Robert Plant and Jimmy Page performing ""No Quarter.""  Robert looks okay - a little old, perhaps - but Jimmy is sprawled out in a suit that looks an acre wide, and were it not for the trademark hair he would seems more like the ghost of Peter Grant than Jimmy Page.  But despite all of the mock enchantment, the song seems a bit naked without the monster drums and riffs.  I'm disappointed, of course - it's one of Led Zeppelin's best songs and probably the most drastically underestimated composition in their playbook, and they lost the opportunity to make an impact; on top of all this, it's also a song that John Paul Jones had a large part in (so much so that it becomes the track in The Song Remains The Same that was incorporated with Jones' fantasy sequence), which makes his non-inclusion in a project named after one of his main songs a bit of a tacky decision on the part of Robert and Jimmy.

From this slow start, the video switches to a live stage setting and the band goes into a great version of ""Thank You"" and the painful ""What Is And What Should Never Be.""  Seeing Robert and Jimmy onstage with a drummer who is not John Bonham (and who is the bass player who is NOT John Paul Jones?) is a bit odd, but you get over it soon when you hear the cornucopia of North African musicians who are playing along with them.  Great, great, great.  The drummer does a fine job, playing ""Four Sticks"" with four drumsticks (two in each hand), and other drum jams bare-handed.  Besides Robert and Jimmy, the band has  Charlie Jones (Robert Plant's son-in-law) on bass, and Porl Thomson, formerly of the Cure, on guitar. One of the surprises of the set was when the band played ""The Battle of Evermore"" with Najma Akhtar, an Indian singer, doing the part sung by the late Sandy Denny of Fairport Convention - it works, partially because you can't be sure if she's singing in English or another language. A few of the songs are performed on a hill with Welsh musicians, giving ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"" an amazing Celtic feeling (probably the reworked number that turns out the best). Present at the filming is an actual black dog.

Jimmy played a couple of shiny new Les Pauls, but also a double-neck Ovation as well as a weird custom-made three-neck object (6-string, 12-string, mandolin). With these heavy instruments, he's often seated. This adds to the appearance that he is in poor health, although for some songs when he does get up and swing the Ovation around it looks pretty awkward - maybe it's better that he stay seated. Like The Song Remains The Same, the camera lingers perhaps a bit too long on Robert Plant... but since he is by far the most dynamic person onstage, I guess it doesn't make sense to complain too much about this point.

One interesting thing about the DVD is that it contains songs that don't appear on other Led Zeppelin DVDs, songs such as ""Thank You"", ""The Battle of Evermore,"" ""Gallows Pole,"" ""When the Levee Breaks,"" ""The Rain Song"", ""Four Sticks"", and ""Friends"".  There are also some cool new songs. ""City Don't Cry"" features Robert and Jimmy jamming with four Moroccan musicians in a courtyard; ""The Truth Explodes"" is done MTV-style (""Where The Streets Have No Name"" perhaps?) in a Moroccan parking lot with some amps, and lots of local people of all ages having a great time.  ""Wah Wah"" is more courtyard folk drone, the Moroccan musicians sing along too.  ""Wonderful One"" is probably the best of the new songs, it's very soulful and beautiful.

Besides the disappointing ""No Quarter"", another song that disappointed was ""When the Levee Breaks"", which was remarkably tuneless.  Others were much better: ""Since I've Been Loving You"" was so good that Jimmy cheered up and gave a big baby-faced grin (finally - it was only 58 minutes into the 93-minute video); ""Rain Song"" with Jimmy's acoustic guitar and a full orchestra was lush and beautiful; and ""Four Sticks"" with the Moroccan orchestra and the snake charmer flute was great, the song is truly amenable to Eastern rhythms and the musicians don't feel tacked on here the way they do on some songs. ""Kashmir"" was... all right, nothing special.  They messed around with it a bit, giving it a quiet intro before getting into the two monster riffs that dominate the song.  Nice Moroccan rock 'n' roll reprise at the end, which included a bit of ""Rock 'n' Roll"".

The DVD has four extras, including an interview with Robert and Jimmy on a traffic island in London that mirrors a bit the interview between Robert and Peter Grant in The Song Remains The Same extras. Porl Thompson seems to be the interviewer (which would mean it was quite scripted), but I may be wrong.  Robert is expressive, but Jimmy stutters a bit and doesn't seem confident.  They point out that ""Since I've Been Loving You"" is their best live song, and the evidence on Unledded seems to back this up (the song appears on all three of their DVD releases). ""Moroccan Montage"" is just that, a delightful series of video scenes from Morocco of the guys hanging out with people. ""Black Dog"" was performed at the ABC American Music Awards, it's energetic but a bit cheezy as well - check out Robert's ""captain"" jacket.  They also tack on the video for ""Most High"" from Robert and Jimmy's poorly-received ""Walking into Clarksdale"" (1998), a song which wasn't performed on Unledded. The video is a by-the-numbers spooky freak show that is sort of a blend of Heironymous Bosch (see also Metallica's ""Until It Sleeps"" video of 1994) and the Sadako scenes in Nakata Hideo's 1998 Ring movie. Not something you'd expect two music legends to be happy to have their names associated with.",1234483200,,5833,4.66374269005848

I like the way they retooled a lot of their songs on this DVD, the Rain Song, Kashmir, Hang Man, Friends, all sound terrific.  Combining the two different orchestras with their rock sound added a nice mix to their music.  By the way, Jimmy Page was a sharp as ever.

If you are a Led Zeppelin fan (at least 1/2 of the group) then this DVD is a nice addition to your music library.  I just hope they come out with a DVD of their recent '07 concert.  We can only hope it leads to a reunion tour someday.",1198540800,,567,4.063063063063063

They've taken the lesser known Led Zep songs and reinvented them as world music classics. I love the locations, the slate mine in Snowdonia, the Moroccan Casbah - what a laugh to see the little kid there covering his ears when Jimmy goes to town on the feedback machine - and the studio stuff of course. Jimmy is still a genius on guitar and deserves his place as one of the 5 best rock guitarists of the 20th century.

I grew up with Zep and these guys are personal heros of mine. Great they didn't stick to the same old thing. Reinvention and change is the key to longevity in music and in life...",1196985600,2,722,4.231884057971015
616266,5,6303284183,"This DVD would be worth the purchase even if The Rain Song was the only song you ever watched. This acoustic version of Zeppelin's most beautiful song (in my opinion) is at least the equal of the studio version. The strings are awesome, and Plant's performance is great, even though his voice is not what it was. It may seem odd to see Jimmy Page sitting and playing acoustic guitar, but nevertheless you will be awed for 7.5 minutes by his mastery. Plant was as well, to judge by his reaction at the end of the song.

The rest of the DVD is of varying quality, although I definitely enjoy more of the songs than not. Jimmy Page is stellar throughout. The second half (from Wonderful One on) is better than the first. Highlights besides The Rain Song include excellent renditions of Since I've Been Loving You and Kashmir. The version of Kashmir is amazing (with a snippet from Black Dog at the end), and the number of musicians required to pull it off showcases the complexity and achievement of the song. The integration of the string section with the blues of Since I've Been Loving You is also well done, and again you will be amazed by Page's guitar prowess, although Plant's performance is not quite as good.

The other songs from Zeppelin III (Gallows Pole, That's the Way, Friends) are all nice, especially That's the Way. Thank You and the new creation Wonderful One are also very enjoyable, featuring some of Plants best vocal work on the DVD.

The rendition of No Quarter is only ok - I enjoy the studio version much more. That song in particular just doesn't work without John Paul Jones. I also don't like What is and What Should Never Be or The Battle of Evermore (the backup singer is too shrill) very much, although the studio versions are wonderful songs.

All in all, it's a great DVD, with only a few songs not up to my (admittedly high) standards. And please buy it for The Rain Song.",1190678400,2,1904,4.510144927536232

616268,2,6303284183,"I am 51 and my musical tastes growing up and since were founded on Led Zeppelin. They were Gods to me and influenced every other musical genre that has appealed to me since from blues to opera. I say this only to show I am pro-zeppelin in the light of this review. I also want to assure people that I am in no way a purist, wanting to oreserve originals from re-interpretation or re-working, as I welcome new versions of classics.
Firstly this is not a concert as such. About a third of the songs are presented in pseudo-MTV style ""on location"" videos which are less than convincing visually and pretty bad musically, utterly destroying as they do some great LZ songs such as No Quarter, Nobody's Fault But Mine and When The Levee Breaks.
The Moroccan excerpts are actually pretty good musically, but are shot in outdoor locations like pop videos.
Of the rest there are pretty good versions of acoustic-style classics like Gallows Pole, What Is and What Should never Be, Battle of Evermore and Rain Song.
My all time ever favorite LZ song is Since I've Been Loving You and the version here is awful, as is Kashmir, the other major live studio offering. There a couple of other passably good acoustic renditions - Friends, That's the Way, but all in all this is a very disappointing DVD, especially as Robert Plant seems in good voice and Jimmy Page is rarely anything but good.
I think the interview with JP and RP is held in the middle of a traffic island in a London street, presumably they think that's ""cool"".
I like Led Zep more than anyone else I've ever known so when I say this is not to be recommeded please believe me. On the other hand the 2003 live collection is as good as anything you are ever likely to see:- Buy that and really see a great band at work. :)",1186704000,8,1772,4.422018348623853

616323,1,6303284183,"Just because it is Paige and Plant, you cannot give it 5 stars. This DVD is horrible. Until around the last few songs, where thanks to the orchestra and semi decent drummer, they pull off a few good numbers. Kashmir is the highlight of the dvd, nice and long, orchestra meshes really well with the song, and plant is least annoying in it.

The dvd starts off in the wrong track. What the hell are Paige and Plant doin with a guitar and mic in the middle of a forest? Is this some kind of a joke? Then there is an absolutely ear bleeding, annoying version of Battle of Evermore with one of the worst backup singers I have ever heard. Someone should just staple her mouth before any more ppl go deaf.

And whats with the tempo of when the levee breaks, they play it like a punk rock song instead of a classic rock n roll song.  And all of a sudden, they are sitting with some dudes in the middle of some middle eastern city, playing with local instruments, its just not there...theres no life, its just lame to see plant acting like he is all into their music n stuff.

I don't know what they were trying to pull with this DVD, I had a completely different picture in mind when I bought it. Kashmir kinda comforted me a bit, but it is still just worthy of a rental and no more.",1158710400,3,1275,4.170731707317073

616325,5,6303284183,"JIMMY PAGE and ROBERT PLANT have once again, put together a musical MASTERPIECE.

I am watching this DVD ""NO QUARTER - JIMMY PAGE & ROBERT PLANT UNLEADED"" absolutely THRILLED with the talent, unique versions of classics, and how  genuinely EXCEPTIONAL this DVD truly is.

This was recorded in 1994 and if you loved Page and Plant back in the 70's you are going to LOVE this DVD. I'm actually AMAZED at how EXCEPTIONAL the music is! Their performances, along with the addition of extremely talented people filmed on location from Morocco and Snowdonia are such a gift to watch,
*****THIS DVD IS AWESOME***** The rich cultural musicians and added scenery truly make THIS DVD the most unique I have EVER seen.

*****I LOVE IT***** I'm watching this with the biggest smile on my face. There is not one boring moment - every song is phenomenal - it's the quality of the music, ALL of the additional elements - watching it all takes my breath away.

One thing is certain, the incomparable talent of Page and Plant has only GROWN richer, deeper, more unique and passionate over time - they are TRULY TIMELESS AND LEGENDARY GIFTS.

I'm loving every nanosecond of this DVD. NO QUARTER - JIMMY PAGE & ROBERT PLANT UNLEADED IS A MUST BUY, MUST OWN, MUST ENJOY AND TREASURE GIFT you will be giving yourself.

The orchestra back-up in ""The Rain Song"" is superior, but it's not fair to single out one song - they are ALL so touching, each in their own unique way, which is what makes THIS DVD so special.

The digitally mastered sound and video quality is amazing.

I only gave this DVD 5 stars because I couldn't give it 5 Million Stars.
It IS TRULY PHENOMENAL, and I mean this with all of my heart.

Fans of Led Zeppelin will both like this and also wish that there had been an electric set from their reunion tour included as well . I saw the guys in Birmingham in 1994 and it was a great gig .

What with the great package of the Led Zeppelin DVD live material being available , I only wish they'd gone that extra yard and offered a little bit more .

I think those people who are interested in a different side to music will enjoy this , as it shows some folky influences , though the rock and blues is always there in the groove .

There is even a country feeling to some of the material .

These guys are still good at the dynamics of live performance and they took time to present the music in the right setting visually .

The sound options have been updated and the extra features are worthwhile .

616331,5,6303284183,"JIMMY PAGE AND ROBERT PLANT HAD EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO CALL JPJ AND JASON BONHAM. IT'S A KNOWN FACT THAT NO BAND WITH THE OBIVIOUS EXCEPTION OF THE SURVIVING BEATLES HAS BEEN OFFERED SO MUCH MONEY TO REFORM. INCLUDING JPJ WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT BUT THE SUBSEQUENT CALL FOR JASON BONHAM AND THEN THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF STAIRWAY STADIUM TOUR WAS SOMETHING ROBERT PLANT NEVER WANTED TO HAPPEN. THIS TOUR WASN'T ABOUT MONEY. IF THAT WAS THE CASE THEY COULD HAVE DONE THE OBIVIOUS AND MADE THREE TIMES MORE MONEY. FRANKLY, I AM GLAD WE DIDN'T GET A REUNION WHICH SIMPLY GAVE THE FAN A BLAST FROM THE PAST FOR OLD TIMES SAKE WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN NICE TO SEE BUT FAR AWAY FROM THE MAGIC OF LED ZEPPELIN'S GLORY DAYS. LED ZEPELIN WAS A BAND THAT NEVER MADE THE SAME ALBUM TWICE. THEY PUSHED THE BOUNDERIES IN THE STUDIO AND ONSTAGE AND THOUGH THEY COULD BE VERY SLOPPY WHEN THEY WERE ON FEW BANDS THEN OR TODAY COULD MATCH THEM FOR SHEER EXCITEMENT AND CONVICTION.

NO QUARTER GIVES US A NEW LOOK AT CLASSIC SONGS WHICH ARE GIVEN A BREATH OF FRESH AIR WITH EGYPTIAN MUSCIANS, SHIMMERING ORCHESTRATION, AND GREAT MUSCIANS WHO GIVE BONHAM AND JONES'S PARTS THE LOVE THEY DESERVE. THE RESULTS ARE A DVD THAT IS LEAPS AND BOUNDS AHEAD OF THE OTHER REUNION OFFERINGS FROM BANDS SUCH AS FLEETWOOD MAC, THE EAGLES, AND PINK FLOYD. HIGHLIGHTS ARE GREAT VERSIONS OF FRIENDS, NOBODY'S FAULT BUT MINE, RAIN SONG, AND KASHMIR.

SOUND QUALITY IS SUPERB AND THIS OVERALL PRESENTATION IS ONE THAT IS BOTH FRESH AND FOREVER MEMORABLE. ROBERT MAY NOT HAVE THE PITCH HE USE TO HAVE BUT HIS LOWER AND MID RANGE TONES ARE IN MANY WAYS BETTER AND MORE CONTROLED AND JIMMY PAGE'S ACOUSTIC WORK IS SIMPLY OUTSTANDING AND RIVALED ONLY BY A FEW GUITAR PLAYERS. WHAT SIMPLY BLEW ME AWAY WAS NIGEL EATON'S HURDY GURDY WHICH LOOKS SO WEIRD BUT PRODUCES SUCH AN ERIE FANTASTIC SOUND. HE ALMOST STOLE THE SHOW AND HIS SOLO DURING THE SUBSEQUENT TOUR WAS REALLY AMAZING. THANKS JIMMY AND EVEN MORE SO TO ROBERT FOR GIVING LED ZEPPELIN'S MEMORY A REUNION WE MAY NOT ALL HAVE LIKED BUT GOT SO MUCH MORE THAN COULD HAVE BEEEN EXPECTED.

616352,5,6303284183,"First off, this is a must have for fans of Zepp as this DVD includes near perfect renditions of all of the classics that were not included on the recent 2 DVD set. Great acoustic stuff here. Not to be missed...

Secondly, Page and Plant should be ashamed of themselves for not inviting John Paul Jones' participation.  It goes against everything that Zeppelin stands for.  Not only did he contribute his solid bass and keyboard skills he was also the single entity that kept the band together in their later years. Explainable for no other reason but sheer Greed.

Shortly after this was filmed, Zepp was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Page, Plant and Jones all accepted the award together along with Bonhams son.  Jones approached the mike and made the public comment when accepting ""I'd like to thank my mates(looking at Page/Plant) for remembering my phone number this time.""  Page and Plant immediately look at each other with embarrassment and shame.  Plant then glances back at Jones while mimmicking that he was searching his jacket and trouser pockets for a pen.

For someone like me, they are almost like mythical gods, because I can only see them via video.  I bought this dvd for both my mom, and my aunt and uncle (who were all at the Zeppelin riot show in '77 at Tampa Stadium).  While Plant's voice unfortunately can't handle the strain of the chorus of ""What is and What Should Never Be"" or ""Black Dog"", he is amazing on ""Thank You"" and ""The Battle of Evermore.""  Also, one song on this dvd made the purchase price well worth it- ""Gallow's Pole""- this live version blows the studio recording out of the water.  Would have liked to see some ""Going to California"" on here.",1108252800,5,895,4.241176470588235
616354,5,6303284183,"Some days ago I was working at home and listening to the radio when they began to comment this DVD. When they began to play the Kashmir version I paralized and could not move till the end of the song while my heart beated harder and harder. I wanted to run away to buy the DVD to listen and view it all in the middle of that night. Finally, I bought this DVD about 7 days ago and I have viewed it about 15 or 20 times since then, and that, considering that I work and study and usually have no free time other than my radio in the background.

This DVD is amazing. Its a combination of the old hard rock of the good Zeppelins, a folk music, middle eastern culture and music, a string classical orchestra and two monsters in the middle of all that. Unfortunatelly, Plants voice is not the same as in the old time and if you pay close attention, those highest notes of his cries are substituted by an electronic echo. But the experiment mixing hard rock, arab music and a string orchestra is amazing with a climax in Kashmir, the final song, where you can see most of the musicians smile proudly while they play their music, stop and start all together in a wonderful performance. The classical celo players look happy and applaud, the egiptian violinist feels so proud during his solo, one egiptian player cant avoid walk ahead and smile while playing. All they know they are making what will always be remembered as a masterpiece of art.

Other nice versions as ""Nobodys fault but mine"" and ""The Battle of Evermore"" are really to stand up and take the hat off. The unplugged versions, the noisy electronic ones (i laught as hell during that maroccan market guitar solo), the scenes with the Maroccan musicians, the go back and forward from one concert to the other, from the mountain to the patio, and from the market to the stage, make the exact combination for a masterpiece of art. If you want to know what good music is about you should buy this DVD. It is a most have for every zeppelin fan, for every rocker, for every good music lover, for every serious musician and of course, for you. Go out and buy it.",1104537600,2,2112,4.385204081632653

616361,5,6303284183,"Ex-Led Zeppelin vocalist and lyricist Robert Plant always said that the true spirit of Led Zeppelin as represented within a single song was more evident in ""Kashmir"" than it was in AOR standby classic tracks like ""Rock & Roll"" and ""Black Dog""; the notion that a hard rock blues-based band of English white boys who practically invented the heavy metal music genre could in fact be considered the godfathers of ""World Beat"" music a full generation before Peter Gabriel came along is conveniently overlooked by Western rock music fans, as is the notion that the principles of Eastern music (in terms of Indian and Arabic theories and applications) were far more prevalent within Led Zeppelin's work than that of the Beatles, typically more associated with Indian music thanks to George Harrison's association with Ravi Shankar.

This outstanding live performance recorded 10 years ago as of this writing is a fantastic example of Plant's opinion and the Led Zeppelin vision of musical exploration gloriously realized.  As detailed within the interview included with this DVD's bonus features, Plant and guitarist/co-songwriter Jimmy Page chose a set that lent itself well to a broad interpretation and that reflected less the brute force of the riff-driven heavy metal classic tracks that permeate albums such as ""Led Zeppelin II"" and their self-titled 4th album (although ""Four Sticks"" and a wild reinterpretation of ""When The Levee Breaks"" are included) and more of the songs crafted as introspective compostions from ""Led Zeppelin III"" and ""Houses Of The Holy"".

This is not Led Zeppelin in their prime; that would be ""How The West Was Won"".  And in truth John Paul Jones' absence is much lamented by this listener as he may well have been the best musician in the band and was the unifying force keeping them together during their last years...but the musicians filling in for him and the late John Bonham are certainly competant and their absence tugs at the sentiment of the heart rather than the sensitivity of the ear.

But for me the accompanying musicians are what really makes this set go.  This is not a case of adding an extra guitarist (i.e., Pat Smear from the ""Nirvana: MTV Unplugged"" concert); the musicians added to this performance play every thing from banjo to hurdy-gurdy to native Arabic lutes, in addition to both Western and Eatern string sections as well as Arabic percussion specialists.  The culmination of the meshing of musical talents and the melding of musical sensibilities is no better realized than in the epic performance of ""Kashmir"", my personal favorite Led Zeppelin song (and perhaps my favorite song by any performer).  The song is hardly recognizable as the 8-plus minute classic rock radio staple; it has instead become the living embodiment of the spirit of the band and with its new energy surpasses the original studio recording whose orchestral sounds were generated from an early synthesizer (by John Paul Jones); the energy and the determination exhibited by the lead and supporting musicians during its performance is thoroughly inspiring and worthy of one of the finest performances in contemporary rock history.

This is a tremendous sampling of a band broken down to its most musical elements.  Not specifically rock, folk, or even acoustic.  Just evidence of the work of one of the finest bands to ever record.  All the elements are there; you owe it to yourself to partake of them.",1100563200,156,3434,5.0477031802120145
616432,3,6303284183,"The Page Plant Unledded session was a big event and kicked off a great reunion tour in the 90s, but those who dearly love Zep are better off with their retrospective DVD set and How The West Was Won.

The Unledded session is generally well made and the lush arrangements by the Egyptian musicians are a nice touch.

But the fact is: the real excitement of watching either man live - ie. rocking out - just isn't there.

Plant's voice sounds hoarse.  And rather cool.  (Once Page/ Plant hit the road later, he would warm up a lot more.)

Highlights are What is and What Should Never Be and Kashmir and When the Levee Breaks.  But generally this is a polite set - not one that sets the world on fire.

I got this for the extras which are pretty good.  22 minutes worth.  I can't comment on the sound quality since I don't have 5.1 surround",1100131200,12,837,4.273885350318471
616433,3,6303284183,"I awaited this release ever since good old 1999 when I bought my first DVD player. The whole Unledded project that Page and Plant undertook was a very ambitious effort and it yielded some powerful results.

The original release of this recording, both on VHS and on CD had a very well-balanced audio mix; a commendable effort considering the vast number of musicians on many of the tracks.

Now onto this DVD release and its remixing.

It has been engineered for both DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, and it also has a standard 2 channel digital audio track. So what's the problem?

Well, the problem is that a good deal of the surround mixing tinkers too much with the original recording and greatly removes the feel of the live performances. Often the engineer took it upon himself to play with different changes in channels and effects right in the middle of songs, creating a rather annoying and unrealistic sound.

I found myself switching from one setting to another in order to bring out one instrument here and another one there. For example in the performances recorded on the hillside in Wales (Nobody's Fault But Mine, When The Levee Breaks) the DTS and Dolby D tracks allow one to really experience the seperation of sound between the instruments and you can really hear each one clearly...except the drums. They fade out into almost non-existence and lose all of their presence and power.

Four Sticks and Kashmir when played in the two channel mix sound entirely different from the old CD, with the Egyptian drums virtually disappearing. But then when you put it into DTS or Dolby D, the Egyptian drums are the only thing in the rear channels, which considering the fact that you're watching a live performance...well, it just sounds entirely unnatural.

All gripes aside, it's great to have this video on DVD format to be able to get the fidelity of sound and image clarity that only DVD can deliver. But it comes with a hefty price.",1100044800,20,1951,4.737463126843658
616434,5,6303284183,"I actually see the point a previous reviewer had about the sound being horrible. The first one I bought from Best Buy sounded horrible as well. It literally sounded like listening to it with blown speakers. I exchanged it for another one, and sure enough my theory about the first one being defective was dead-on. The second one sounds amazing. It truly rocks on a surround sound system. This is a must-have for any Zeppelin fan.",1099612800,2,429,4.657894736842105
616435,5,6303284183,"Face it children, there is no one better. This is pure bliss.  Even just having half of the legendary Led Zeppelin (Robert Plant and Jimmy Page) this is better than virtually any concert DVD you will ever view.  The two rework virtually all of the 13 Zeppelin classics into stirring orchestral versions that sometimes are entirely different from the original (take a look at the bonus video of Black Dog from the American Music Awards where the only thing similar to the original is the lyrics).  Some songs work extremely well such as the Rain Song which, if you never gave the song a chance, this version with its powerful string arangements coupled with Jimmy's soft acoustic strummings and the drummer Michael Lee (who plays his balls off to help himself remotely compare to John Bonham which I respect him for) plays lightly with jazz brushes and strongly in the heavier parts of the song.  The Battle of Evermore has Jimmy playing mandolin and some Indian lady singing with Robert.  The song is superior to the studio version.  Gallows Pole rocks it out acoustically with the orchestral arrangements.

The reworked version of No Quarter that intros the DVD is a stirring new version of Jonesy's old keyboard based classic except there's no keys this time.  You get to watch Jimmy and Robert in the woods as Jimmy strums away on an acoustic 12-string and Robert doing effects on his voice LIVE!  Look at his lap and you'll notice.  Thank You, What Is And What Should Never Be, and Since I've Been Loving You all stay faithful to the originals except for Jimmy's new shredding solos that he's tacked onto Thank You and of course his always visionary work on Since I've Been Loving You.

Now onto the stuff in foreign lands and the boys themselves.  Robert, for his age, blew my mind.  At age 50 he can still sing better than most people half his age which is a real tribute to his blatant vocal talent.  Jimmy seems to really enjoy himself inspite of looking much older.  He still plays amazingly it's just he just looks so freakin old its shocking.  It doesn't matter though because he rocks that much.  The new songs, City Don't Cry, The Truth Explodes, and Wah Wah are all recorded outdoors in Morocco with local musicians and really show the ability of Jimmy and Robert to be extremely eclectic.  Wonderful One is taken from the show itself and is also a new song.  It is a stirring acoustic song with some great acoustic work by Jimmy.  Nobody's Fault But Mine really didn't do it for me maybe because it just doesn't work acoustically but that's a small gripe.  When The Levee Breaks is also rerecorded on a Misty Mountain Top just like Nobody's Fault But Mine and actually works quite well acoustically.

That's The Way stays true to its roots aside from the kongas and bongos and whatnot as well as the drums which are nonexistent on the original.  Four Sticks is loaded with lotsa crazy percussion from a Moroccan Orchestra.  Friends is filled with violins and is a generally good moving song.  Then comes the grand finale.  The best 10 minutes of the show.  Kashmir.  This version surpasses all.  The orchestra melds beautifully with the band and fits like a hand in a glove.  Just having the live strings as compared to just having Jonesy do it all through keyboards back in the day give it a step up.  The song starts slowly and at various times stops for a violin solo as well as some crazy bongos stuff.  Jimmy Page plays this $50,000 guitar that is more like a computer for this song.  He makes millions of sounds somehow throughout this song and towards the end gives everyone a teaser of Black Dog.  The song and show ends with everyone jamming around Black Dog for about two minutes and then everyone leaves as the orchestra finishes out.

The bonuses rock.  The interview is cool.  Most High is a good Kashmir like song off of Walking Into Clarksdale the collaboration between Plant and Page.  The song is cool but the middle eastern-esque keyboard breaks get annoying when we all know that Jimmy Page could be soloing.  Black Dog is great as explained above.

Overall, buy this piece of history.  I know, I know you'r unsure but trust me it rules.  Sure it's mostly acoustic and that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to buy it but still it's amazing.  You're mind will be blown.",1099353600,7,4307,4.597112860892389
616436,5,6303284183,"Being a LZ fan, I bought this long-awaited DVD when it first came out and I'm very pleased with it.  The remastered sound and picture are a vast improvement over the video and the audio CD. The vocal singing of Plant and the guitar of Page are much clearer and resonant. In the video and original CD, Page's guitar sounded muddled at times but here it comes out very clearly, especially in the acoustic guitar numbers (""Rain Song,"" ""Wonderful One,"" ""That's the Way,"" ""Friends"", etc.).  This performance of Page and Plant is much better than their reunion in 1988 during the Atlantic Records Anniversary.  Here, Page and Plant seem to be enjoying themselves, they work well together, and are supported by outstanding musicians and sound crew.

Charlie Jones and Michael Lee do a great job of filling in on bass and drums (even though no one can fully sub for John Bonham but Lee does the best that he can).  They are backed up by an excellent orchestra (London Metropolitan) and the full orchestra sound resonates in numbers such as ""Friends"" and ""Kashmir.""

There are 2 numbers that come off especially well. The ""Battle of Evermore"" features an outstanding performance by Najma Akhtar singing alongside Plant. She sings way better than Sandy Denny in the studio version. The ""Rain Song"" (featuring Page on acoustic guitar) is beautifully done and the orchestral back-up is a nice touch.

Besides the vastly improved sound and picture quality, I was delighted to see the inclusion of several special features: an interview with Plant and Page, a stirring new version of ""Blackdog"" performed during the ABC American Music Awards, and the MTV music video of ""Most High.""

If you're a Zep fan, you'll love this DVD.  Highly recommended!",1099267200,,1733,4.887372013651877
616437,5,6303284183,"I can't disagree more with the guy who said the DVD was distorted - their system must be set up very incorrectly or they blew some cones. In fact I'd agree with the review that said it should be a sonic reference disc (eg. like The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over... but a lot cooler)- eg. the surround mix is used to great effect on What Is & What Should Never Be.

It's a great package. You get;

A surreal vid of No Quarter, intimate concert footage including with Egyptian ensembles, & classical light orchestra. It is definately not all unplugged - Page cranks the Les Paul quite a lot & the drums are loud at times. Then if you were bored by all this  - the middle section transports you to exotic Morocco for a few live songs - then back again to the original concert. You have lots of classic Zep (OK no Stairway - but you don't need it) & new songs like Wonderful One which is er, wonderful. Not to mention the extras of Black Dog, weird vid for Most High & a street interview.

You couldn't make a better DVD of this type. Thank You Page/Plant & all those other musicians & staff involved.",1099180800,8,1094,4.220095693779904

Im only 19 but have been listening to Zeppelin for a while now because of Jimmy Page I have my own Gibson Les Paul.  When I was watching the dvd I was cracking up because it was kind of funny watching Robert hit some of his trademark notes because of his age but none the less he was doing it.  Some people thing Jimmy has lost his touch.  Those people must be mentally retarded or something like that.  His guitar playing is amazing.  The sound quality is amazing on the dvd. I also purchased the cd too and the quality is good on that too.  Nobody's Fault But Mine is amazing, No Quarter is Amazing, Since I've Been Loving You sounds like it was just recorded, Four Sticks is off the hook and I cant forget Kashmir; it sounded amazing with all the middle eastern influences in it.  You guys have to remember that this was meant for MTV Unplugged.  Thats why all the songs are toned down, nothing heavy here.  It would be great if Robert and Jimmy came together and wrote some new material...I would be the first to buy it.",1098921600,3,1118,4.30622009569378
616439,5,6303284183,"Well, Sir Robert and James Page have done it again!

This time, in a re-release of MTV's 1994 Special UnLedded Page and Plant video, the full beauty of Robert's voice, and Jimmy Page and his mastery of guitar legend abound.

It is replete with wonderful moments, such as Gallows Pole, featuring Jimmy playing one of his own BlackMountainside Brand custom acoustic guitars, Friends, a fabulous, exotic song from Zep III, and a heavy version of THE song, Kashmir, replete with cello phenom Caroline Dale, her entire ensemble of British cellists, Giles, Milne, et al, an Egyptian string ensemble, (with monstrously talented Egyptian violin soloist Wael Abu Bakr) doing lead violin solo, and Jimmy playing the 50,000$, multi computerized GIbson Les Paul Transperformance guitar - capable of instantaneously moving and retuning to nearly 100 different modal tunings real time- with relish. Jimmy has that device down to a science. Kashmir is simply still astonishing and brings tears to the eyes delivered like this. Power and glory abound here.

There is EVEN Page/Plant/Jones and Lee, doing a parody of Dred Zeppelins' (Nobody's Fault) doing a parody of Led Zep. How about that for turnabout? All in good fun of course. It's even dumbed down to Dreds level for extra gusto.

The other piec de resistanc' is No Quarter, the beginning song, filmed outdoors, in the woods, in Wales, with Jimmy doing a totally re-worked No quarter in modal 12 string, acoustic, and Robert handling his own array of black boxes (on his lap) through which he does misty mountain hopping special FX for his voice, in real time. THIS is priceless.

There are a few (very few) weak spots here and there, but after all, these guys are middle aged fellows, like many of us, here, and none of us are what we were when we were 25. And Bonham's presence is noticable at times. Thank You could have been a better take.

But on the whole, this is thrilling music, with enormous scope, big time arrangements, TOP talent doing backup roles. The hurdy gurdy, rich mandolins, and violas and Bodhran add especially flavorful ethnic mixes to the final product. It is exciting, fresh, and full of new twists. I loved the jam with the musicians in Morrocco. And in Marrackech, that anthem, with Pagey doing the moonwalk, is just plain loud fun.

Where Pagey gets these special effects is anyones' guess. He never runs out of new ideas, or new gear. No one, save perhaps Gilmour, knows more about the technical end of guitar, electronics, FX, cutting edge tech, and the like. These two fellows have pushed the state of the guitar ahead 100 years... if only there were people behind them picking up where they left off. As long as that is not the case, WE need JP showing us the way..

SIBLY is again, great. If you liked Led Zep, I dare say you will probably love this video. It is worth watching and keeping. You won't find another live rock band like this for another hundred years or more. And with this high calibre of musicians backing them up, you won't see a show like this again. That much is assured. Guaranteed.",1098835200,39,3077,4.749063670411985
616440,4,6303284183,"I am just back from seeing this DVD on the big screen and enjoyed it quite a bit. Though most of the tracks are the same as in No Quarter cd, there is one important difference -- Plant's voice has been fixed. It had sounded quite horrible on the cd (apparently he had a cold during the MTV performance) but here, the tracks sounds as they were meant to. And every one of them is a little gem in its own right. I was particularly pleased to hear ""the rain song"", my favourite led zeppelin track, which was left out on the CD.

 The downside is that there is not a whole lot in the DVD on the visual front. They try to intersperse tracks from different concerts & settings to avoid the visual monotony but the last four or five tracks are all from the same concert and it shows. What would have made real sense is if the tracks on this DVD had been released as the original cd, then there would have been no need for this DVD.

From the the quietest accoustic moments of Rain Song to the thunder of Kashmir, everything is crystal clear.

This release corrects that & follows through on the possibilities with a great DTS mix!  The audio is sharp & clear & I found that after watching this for the first time in quite awhile that I enjoyed it even more than before.  That's probably because of the upgrade in quality.

Whoever mixed this disaster should be thrown up againt the wall and horsewhipped - and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant should get first dibs with the whips of their choice.  The mix is loud to the point of distortion.  That might be acceptable if this was 1967, but this is 2004 and Atlantic should be ashamed of itself putting out such a sonic disaster in this day and age.

It also includes the video for ""Most High"", from the Walking Into Clarksdale album from '98.

The MTV Unledded performance from Page & Plant is truly magical. The reworking of Led Zep classics such as Nobody's Fault But Mine, No Quarter, When The Levee Breaks and Kashmir, add a whole new dimension to these classic songs. It shows an admirable willingness to roll the dice on the part of Page & Plant. Songs like Thank You, What Is And What Should Never Be stay pretty much true to the original arrangements. Plant's voice is incredible, although he's not able to reach the high notes like he used to, and Page's guitar playing is also fantastic. Witness the solo on Since I've Been Loving You - he's lost none of his magic!

The new tracks that came from the Unledded project are also well worth their place in the set. Page & Plant really seem to enjoy the challence of playing with the local Morroccan musicians. Wonderful One and The Truth Explodes are both fantastic tracks.

I can't say how much of an impact this made on me the first time I saw it.  My dad bought it on VHS and we watched it when I was about 16.  That was it for me.  I discovered real music.  I'm 21 now, and Led Zepplin still remains on of my favorite bands including Talking Heads and Jethro Tull.  I always wondered why this concert never went on DVD, so to finnally find it was great.  This music started it all for me.  It's deep, powerful, fun and emotional music.  Note -  People who like ""The Backstreet Boys"" will, more then likely, not like this music.  It's not pop, just great music.",1049587200,39,1352,4.426829268292683
616547,5,6303284183,"I had the chance to see this broadcast on MTV when it was originally showed. Since that day I curse myself daily for not having prepared a tape to record it.
My brother purchased the VHS edition recently, and it looks really neat. Video and audio quality are really good. But not as good as a DVD...
Will this be ever released on DVD with 5.1 audio? I certainly hope so (not like Marillion's first video-compilation DVD which was recorded on regular stereo only).
As one of the other reviews mentions: if there is a concert worth to be transferred to DVD, it is this one!",1037145600,2,571,4.39622641509434
