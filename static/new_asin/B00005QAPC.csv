7949881,5,B00005QAPC,"This DVD is a compilation of two videos: Clifford's Fluffiest Friend Cleo and Clifford Saves the Day.  Each has 4 episodes from the television show.  The stories are fun and all have an underlying message about how to be better people.  They are:
CLIFFORD'S FLUFFIEST FRIEND CLEO
Cleo's Fair Share - Cleo gets a new toy but is afraid to share it.
Fluffed Up Cleo - Cleo wins an award for fluffiest and learns that bragging is not fun.
Two's Company - K.C. returns to the island and Cleo wants him all to herself.
Friend's Morning, Noon, and Night - Cleo moves in with Clifford and becomes a nuisance.
CLIFFORD SAVES THE DAY
Stormy Weather - Clifford annoys people with his digging but manages to save the library from a huge storm.
Islander of the Year - People nominated for Islander of the Year have all been helped by Clifford.
Circus Stars - Clifford's hero, Gordo the Great, is sick and asks him to help out with the circus.
Clifford on Parade - Emily and Charlie argue about floats for the big parade and Clifford tries to help them out.
Extras:  I was a little disappointed in these.  Doggie Fun Facts and Big Ideas were just what I expected, but I was hoping for more from Learn the Clifford Dance.  this is actually a commercial for the show made up of tiny clips.  First you spin all around and jump up and down, and then you bark, that's the Clifford dance.",1058313600,5,1368,4.426294820717131

7949883,5,B00005QAPC,"My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and enjoys the clifford series on PBS.  I gave this to her as a Christmas gift, and she was very excited to see it.  There are 8 episodes on this DVD, which is an excellent value for the price.  The DVD is divided into two ""chapters"" with four episodes per chapter.  The episodes play continuously.  Once you finish one set of four episodes you have to start the next chapter manualy.  There are several features including play all episodes, choose your episode, real doggy friends, and cliffords ""big idea"".  Every episode has a different lesson to learn.  These chapters focus on being friends and helping others.
Bottom line:  If you want your child to watch good, old fashioned educational cartoons, then this is for you.",1011657600,8,756,4.666666666666667
