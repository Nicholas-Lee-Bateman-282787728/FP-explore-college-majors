8424490,3,B004CZZZ2M,"Johnny Allegro, 1949 film

We see Los Angeles and the florist shop of Johnny Allegro. Men wear suits and hats. A woman talks to Johnny, they walk away. A man watches them. Glenda Chapman wants to get away alone, she is being watched by a detective. Allegro returns her fur coat. Later a man visits him to talk about his background and then ask for a favor. Later Glenda asks Johnny for help in getting away. Johnny shoots the man who stopped him! We learn more about this event. Johnny wants to leave with Glenda. [Lockheed Hudson?] They arrive in Florida. Next is a boat trip at night to a large mansion. Morgan greets his wife, then shows his archery skills. Johnny crumples newspapers to warn of any intruder. [The Maltese Falcon?] A heavy candlestick is at hand. Goodnight Johnny.

The next morning two men arrive at the island. Johnny is told to make a telephone call, he does. Next its a restaurant. But Johnny has a malaria flare-up and goes to the VA hospital. Morgans racket is counterfeit money, it is easily distributed at the racetrack. It was created during WW II by the enemy to wreck he economy. [Does inflating the currency have the same effect?] Morgan distrusts everybody. Competition is healthy. [Would this big mansion be built on a small island?] A man follows Johnny but is ditched so he can board the boat and use its radio. Morgan meets with his business associates, there is a conflict that is resolved. Johnny doesnt want to leave without the money. Morgan discovers the blanks in Johnnys gun! Johnny fights with that Captain in the cave and wins. Morgan shoots arrows at Johnny! Will Morgan miscalculate? Yes, he falls down. Johnny tells the score to Glenda. The T-men arrive to wrap things up.

This is an about average story that is interesting. It concentrates on personalities rather than events, a psychological drama. [I remember once seeing a dollar bill stamped Valid for Hawaii Only, a scheme to prevent its use elsewhere should these islands be captured in WW II.] Counterfeit currency was used by the British during the American Revolution to devalue the Continental paper dollar. That is why many people chose silver over paper dollars (it rang true).",1399593600,2,2190,4.757894736842105
8424491,4,B004CZZZ2M,"George Raft plays JOHNNY ALLEGRO in his usual suave style, romancing a very young and blonde Nina Foch who is married to crime lord George Macready.  Helping Foch out of a jam, Raft is taken to a mysterious island off the Florida coast and meets Macready, whose hobby is to hunt game (and humans) with a bow and arrow.

Raft is working undercover for the FBI and communicates with them by radio on a yacht anchored on Macready's dock.  Raft is very good in his dancing scenes with Foch and almost succeeds in uncovering Macready's crime operation. Question is, as an ex-gangster himself, will he win Foch from Macready before or after the ""hunt"" after Raft begins?

Film is beautifully shot in black and white and is quite entertaining if you like Raft as a dancer and lover.  Remember him in SCARFACE?

Thanks to Warner Archives and Amazon, I was able to resurrect this very entertaining film from the forties for my noir collection.",1370736000,2,934,4.664634146341464
8424492,4,B004CZZZ2M,"Columbia Pictures presents ""JOHNNY ALLEGRO"" (1949) (81 min/B&W) -- Starring: George Raft, Nina Foch, George Macready & Will Geer

Directed by Ted Tetzlaff

A reformed gangster, accustomed to a life of danger, finds himself dealing with a new and different threat in this adventure thriller. Johnny Allegro (George Raft) is a former mobster who has gone over to the other side and now works for the U.S. Treasury Department as an undercover agent. Allegro is asked to help get the goods on Morgan Vallin (George Macready), a polished counterfeiter who is involved in a right-wing plot to bring down the American government by flooding the U.S. economy with bogus currency. Allegro makes his way to the island that's Vallin's base of operations, with Glenda Chapman (Nina Foch) in tow, and he convinces Vallin that he's a fugitive from American justice. Vallin takes Allegro and Glenda in, but he soon discovers Johnny's true identity, and Allegro learns that Vallin has a bizarre hobby he likes to hunt, but he feels that humans are a more interesting quarry than animals.

A fabulous Raft film and totally love George Macready with his sinister whispering voice.
