I was going into this expecting a movie about moses but what I got was braveheart mixed with gladiator and 300. since when was moses I fighter and a general to an army he was a peace loving man. this movie is garbage to me and laughable I was hoping that Christian bale did a good job but he tried his best to turn s*** into gold. and how can you say the epic story of moses when it isn't. oh well they tried something new and it flopped. the story sucked, the acting was ok and the special effects were ok. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you don't",1476057600,,596,3.975
