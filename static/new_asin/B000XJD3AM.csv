8228424,5,B000XJD3AM,This movie I saw back in the late 70's or early 80's. I just loved it. Its about a young couple. They are so cute in  this movie that I just laughed from beginning to end. I'm so happy that I found. This will be one for my collection.,1387411200,,234,3.7755102040816326
8228425,3,B000XJD3AM,"This is not an Oscar-winning flick.  Although the plot is alittle thin,the film is a light, funny, make you laugh and feel good vehicle, with a recognizable cast including Burgess Meredith, Jack Alberston and two of the most versatile characters actors to ever grace the ""big"" and ""little"" screens, Claude Akins and Neville Brand (initially known for their ""heavies"" portrayals, but also well known for their ability to adapt well to any genre they appeared in). A good family flick.",1387238400,,483,5.0375
8228426,5,B000XJD3AM,"I had a friend who loved all of Tim Matheson's movies. I like him too, especially ""Buried Alive"", so I found this movie enjoyable... perhaps not as suspenseful as ""Buried Alive"", but still engaging. It kept my interest. This movie was about two young people who want to do what's right, get married and start a family together, but they end up having to run from the girl's father and her brothers... a Romeo and Juliet theme set in the west in the 1880's. I especially liked the wagon crossing over the impossible road in the mountains.",1369008000,,537,4.546391752577319
8228427,4,B000XJD3AM,"A typical 70s made for t.v. western. More comedy than action. Moves along a little slow,but an overall good story. The supporting actors are great,with plenty of star power filling these roles. Akins and Brand steal the show. The transfer is a 4.5 out of 5, 99 minutes long,& in color. This was a good/fun western.",1369008000,,314,4.625
8228428,5,B000XJD3AM,"Another top quality release from TMG. Always great prints of rare Universal TV Movies from the now 'classic' period.  Tim  Matheson and Belinda Montgomery make a likeable duo who travel the west of 1880.
Along the way we meet Robert Emhardt, Neville Brand, Claude Akins, Jack Albertson, John Beck, Felicia Farr, Mills Waston, Charles Dierkop and Burgess Meredith.
