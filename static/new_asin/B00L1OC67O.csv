8663105,5,B00L1OC67O,"A fantastic way to enhance your memory. I am over 70 years old and I have problems with short term memory loss. I forget where I put my glasses and keys to my car. I think these are pretty common for people our age. I have difficulty remembering names, like when I meet people at a party or at other social functions. I forget to take medications and I think that also is common for my age. I was hoping to get out of this video ways to improve on the things I just mentioned. This is the first time I ever saw a video like this with ways to help me cope with my memory issues. Watching the video I learned ways to associate ideas and formulate memory strategies so that there will be no next time I forget where I left my keys and glasses and to take my medication. A great video that was easy to understand memory techniques. I would recommend this video for anyone - not just senior citizens - and for people of all ages actually. It made sense.",1404172800,2,948,4.129729729729729
