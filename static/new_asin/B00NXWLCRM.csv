8681013,3,B00NXWLCRM,Dated.  Wooden acting.  Russ Tamblyn should have stuck to dancing.  Even his hat in this movie is silly.,1437350400,,104,4.666666666666667
8681014,3,B00NXWLCRM,"A more mature looking Russ Tamblyn, who had done The Young Guns back in 1956, returns the western genre in this 1965 tale of a gunfighter who blames his outlaw father for leaving them and his mothers eventual death.  The father, James Philbrook, has fled to Mexico with his gang.  Traveling south Johnny Ketchum is wounded helping Don Pedro Fortuna and stays at the hacienda to heal and a love affair develops between Johnny and Pilar (Don Pedro's daughter).  Now Johnny must decide whether he can overcome his hatred of his father for the love of Pilar.  Add in a rival Mexican outlaw gang and you have a interesting tale.  Well done western and worth a watch to western fans.  A trivia note for fans - Russ Tamblyn also appeared in the 2012 Django Unchained as Son Of The Gunfighter and his daughter Amber Tamblyn appeared as the daughter of Son Of A Gunfighter.  Son Of A Gunfighter is a entertaining watch.",1427500800,,910,4.580246913580247
