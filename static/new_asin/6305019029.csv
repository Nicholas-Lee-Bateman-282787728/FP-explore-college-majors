7883345,2,6305019029,"This is a rather uneven story about members of the crew ""skyjacking"" a spaceship filled with millionaires in what is clearly an ill conceived plan, even under the best circumstances. The film includes androids, self centered passengers and Dawn (Amanda Pays) an executive secretary who is also a spaceship buff.

I couldn't wait for the film to end. It started out fair, in spite of the low budget aspect, but the big scenes weren't big and the acting and dialogue were a bust.

7883346,4,6305019029,"i liked the previews of it. about a second mate who kills the captain to get the bank accounts, of the wealthy passengers, or he will blow up the ship. kids should not watch this it has nudity in it.",1365724800,,199,4.0
7883347,1,6305019029,"First the good things:  It is available on DVD.  It is in color.  It only lasts 89 minutes -- a very LONG 89 minutes.  The cast members have, in other works, demonstrated varying degrees of acting talent.  The concept of the story is something that COULD have  been developed into a mediocre story line.

Then the bad things:  Act I, Act II, & Act III.  I believe this may have been a very early project for the director.  At least I hope it was.",1365465600,,446,4.2023809523809526
7883348,3,6305019029,"&#65279;&#65279;The luxury liner Star Princess equipped with everything a wealthy hedonistic space passenger

would desire including gambling, virtual reality, etc. is on her maiden voyage.  Alex Barnes

(Corbin Bernsen), the second mate, kills the captain and highjacks the ship. He and his associates

demand password access to the bank accounts of all the  passengers or he will blow up

the huge liner after escaping with a confederate headed in their direction of space.  Things go

awry for them as Ryan Taylor (Steve Bond), first mate, and a young passenger name Dawn

(Amanda Pays), bravely put their own lives at risk to save the ship and its passengers.  Barnes

attempts to thwart Taylor and Dawn at saving the ship reminds me somewhat of Wil E Coyote.

There was quite a bit of action and special effects.  Overall the movie was average, not

exceptional.  This review was of a previewed VHS copy purchased from Blockbuster.",1106870400,,936,5.026143790849673
