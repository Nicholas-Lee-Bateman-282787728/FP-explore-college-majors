7295458,5,B00ZVJ97BS,"I have been a fan of Lindsey Stirling ever since someone shared with me the ""Mission Impossible Theme"" video she did with the Piano Guys.  After falling in love with her album ""Shatter Me,"" I had the pleasure of seeing her live at the Hard Rock in Orlando in July 2014.  It was the best concert I've ever attended!  This DVD, though filmed in London, captured perfectly what I remembered from her Orlando show.  The music, energy, and staging of this concert is outstanding.  When the DVD arrived, I watched it twice back-to-back and still wanted more!  Whether you are a Stirlingite already, new to her music, or unaware of what an outstanding musician and performer Lindsey Stirling is, you will be blown away by this DVD.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1439164800,19,762,4.684210526315789
7295459,5,B00ZVJ97BS,"Awesome! Think if you are reading this you are likely already a fan, so I won't go into how totally awesome her performances are. But if you just happened to stumble across Lindsey Stirling do yourself a huge favor and check out her Youtube video's. Show is excellent as you would expect from her and her friends. Only disappointment I have is, while it was released on bluray in Europe, it was only released on dvd here. Can't imagine why. Still I absolutely recommend it. I hope more Lindsey Stirling concerts are released in the future.",1438992000,13,539,4.625
7295460,5,B00ZVJ97BS,"Absolutely a must buy for stirlingites. Watching this made me feel like I was in the audience just as energetic as anyone else. As with anything Lindsey Stirling releases, this was well worth the money!

7295461,5,B00ZVJ97BS,"**Added comments regarding Blu-Ray and CD release in comments below!**

Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of Lindsey, Gavi, and Drew - together they create a live atmosphere that is one-of-a-kind and leaves you smiling long after they leave the stage. Having just seen the Music Box tour in St. Louis, I eagerly awaited the release of Live From London, though it's important to note that this was the previous tour with a slightly different song and set lineup.

Overall, this London show was an excellent show musically-speaking and with regard to energy and crowd excitement. Speaking as a photographer/videographer/editor, the capture and editing of this disc/transfer is fast-paced and a bit jumpy at times (not in a bad way - those that have seen Lindsey know how high-energy she is across the stage, etc). However, this gives you angles that you'd have no way of seeing (examples: behind Drew playing drums, and Gavi on the keys) elsewhere. There are a few odd edits here and there that are a bit rough (most likely only noticeable to sound editors), but they don't take anything away from the enjoyment of the concert - there are dead spots in every concert for costume changes, etc. that are handled via hard cuts here. For the Music Box tour, Lindsey used quite a bit of visual filler (in a really enjoyable way) to minimize these lulls and tie each song into one large story. So, if you've seen the Music Box tour, this one was a little different - you can still expect is amazing performances from Lindsey, Gavi, and Drew along with plenty of visual flair. The disc opens with a monologue introduction from Lindsey that is sweet, and very true to who she is, before leading into an excellent rendition of Beyond the Veil (my personal favorite, which was changed to the stage/dancer introduction song in the Shatter Me/Music Box tour) - I enjoyed that song being used as an opener as opposed to a closer. Do note, however, that Chapter 1 actually does contain the beginning of the song - she is speaking over the first minute or so. I would expect this to most likely be only on the DVD as opposed to the CD (which I have not yet received or reviewed).

Overall, her performance during this concert was nothing short of excellent - having been 10 feet away from her in other venues while watching her play (and hearing stage music versus house sound), I still don't understand how some people think the sound is pre-recorded. Without going off on a tangent there, this is most certainly authentic playing (as an example, she loses tune on the E string midway through Roundtable Rival), and she nails these songs. Obviously the sound for this release was taken from the soundboard mix, but there is a bit of audience and house sound mixed in. Would also like to mention that the videographer off of her right shoulder behind the stage was either doing a fantastic job, or a lot of editing time was put in on that shot angle. That angle of video on Shatter Me is absolutely intense and energetic. It's hard to capture the energy of her shows without 60p, but we're not there in the mainstream just yet. ;)

It is important to note that there are also unlisted bonus features on this disc - the original Everdream copies of Beyond The Veil, Shatter Me, and Roundtable Rival are included, along with a 7-minute 'Backstage Interview' snippet with Lindsey and company/crew. A nice little bonus!

The obvious letdown here is that there seems to be a licensing or rights issue with what can be released in the US/UK versus the rest of the EU. The MPEG2 artifacts of a 5000kbps 480p stream are difficult to overcome on a 4K display, even using madVR or similar. Even the AutoRip and MP3 purchases of the album can not be made outside of Germany or Switzerland, which is a heads-up to anyone out there thinking that's an easy way to get the audio. And, as any fan knows by now, this is nowhere to be found on Spotify, iTunes, Tidal, and so forth... However, I was able to import both the Blu-Ray and CD versions of this concert from Amazon.de, so keep that in mind for anyone here who needs the better video (and perhaps audio, but we'll get to that in a moment) source.

Since I've been posting in the thread regarding the Blu-Ray version of this, I wanted to also post some relevant data here for fans that are more on the technical side. The great news is this: WE GET 24/48 LPCM! That makes me happy in so many ways (especially since they didn't have to include anything but the lossy surround streams). I'm not really impressed by either the AC3/DD or DTS streams, but I will hold out hope for lossless TrueHD or DTS-MA for the BD release.

For the fan that doesn't want to read any further technical jargon - rest assured that this is a great concert, and a great composition. If you can deal with the DVD resolution, the audio is fantastic. If you're in the mood to import the Blu-Ray, I would (for the moment) recommend doing so. Perhaps licensing conflicts on this will change down the road, but I thought I'd share the info I have for now.

For the tech-minded, here's a quick rundown:

Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (16:9) 29.97fps 5000kbps [V: mpeg2 main, yuv420p, 720x480, 5000 kb/s]

...Standard 480p 4:2:0 16:9 that we were expecting - 5000kbps is more than enough for 720x480.

Lossless Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 2304kbps [A: pcm_dvd, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s24, 2304 kb/s]

Lossy Audio: DTS 48000Hz 6ch 768kbps [A: dts, 48000 Hz, 5.1, 768 kb/s]
Lossy Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6ch 384kbps [A: ac3, 48000 Hz, 5.1, 384 kb/s]

So, hooray! We have 24-bit 48kHz LPCM 2ch, which is even better than I had hoped for.

The Blu-Ray version I ordered of this will be in (most likely) next week, and I will add the information regarding that disc as soon as it arrives. Here's hoping for a multi-channel LPCM 24/48 track!

7295538,5,B00ZVJ97BS,"I discovered this lovely and talented young woman during my forays online.  I am so glad that she didn't listen to the so-called judges on America's Got Talent and followed her own path.  Not many performers combine violin and dance so admirably.  Perhaps she isn't a mainstream performer but she has a beautiful performance.  As for the product, itself, it arrived as described and on time.",1456185600,,391,4.878787878787879

Lindsey Stirling is genuine and confident, which is why she is so appealing to her audience. I feel connected to her through her enthusiasm for her fans and the purpose of her music. We watch performances she has choreographed and music she has written, all fantastic and motivating us to get out on the floor ourselves, dancing to the catchy, upbeat songs that inspire confidence and energize us.",1455926400,,493,4.67816091954023

Otherwise I would have given a 5 star rating.
I really don't think replacing the disc will fix it.
Seems to be a production error that wasn't fixed.",1451606400,2,216,4.2926829268292686

7295558,1,B00ZVJ97BS,"I first saw Lindsey a few years ago on a video and thought she was cute and played beautiful music as she stood there playing her fiddle. So I ordered this video and wow! what a difference! She no longer stands and plays her music- she jumps around and dances and never stands still. And part of the time there are two guys dancing beside her (why?). There are distracting graphics and kaleidoscope effects flashing in the background, a continuous light show, and strobes flashing at irregular intervals. She and her music are pretty much buried by the visuals,drums and keyboards. In fact, her music seems to be a non-relevant part of the production. I'm an old guy and all I wanted was to see a pretty young woman stand there playing pretty music on  her fiddle. I tried watching for about ten minutes, switching tracks trying to find something I could watch and then gave up and wrote it off as a bad entertainment investment. This video is now in my Goodwill donation box.",1448150400,6,976,4.577142857142857

7295563,3,B00ZVJ97BS,"Two songs into this DVD I couldn't help but wonder if the violin parts were not being played live.  It seems impossible to me that a person can dance around like Lindsey does and still play the violin as well as she does.  The three star rating is for the interludes between the songs. Like someone else said, this would be a better DVD if the talking segments were deleted.",1444176000,2,374,4.328571428571428

7295566,3,B00ZVJ97BS,"The music and musicianship are great but she comes across as insincere and annoying in her stage presence - calling herself sexy? OK, not to me - that's something a woman confident in her sexuality doesn't need to say, it simply exudes from her - so I wish they left her stage banter out and just showed the music performances which are really good.",1443139200,2,349,4.46875

7295569,5,B00ZVJ97BS,"I became a fan of Lindsey Stirling pretty recently, so I decided to order this DVD, hoping it would be good. I wasn't disappointed! From the beginning I was drawn in. She gives her all in each performance, her routines are fantastic, the interaction with the ""band"" and with the audience is outstanding. Before every performance she'll talk about how each certain piece was created and why, then she'll say what she is about to perform. This was helpful because before I even knew this DVD existed, I had only seen her website plus only had her second album, ""Shatter Me"" which is great. I just recently bought her first album, thanks to watching this concert. This is a pretty good introduction to Lindsey Stirling for those who are more recent fans like myself. She is just amazing and her beautiful personality shines throughout. I highly recommend this and her two albums for those looking for something different and unique to enjoy outside of mainstream music.",1442361600,8,966,4.825301204819277

7295577,4,B00ZVJ97BS,My wife and I went to a show of hers.  We missed a lot of her foot steps due to us being so close to the stage but yet far enough back to see heads not feet.  This would have received five stars if it where HD quality.  There are sections where it gets a little grainy at times.
