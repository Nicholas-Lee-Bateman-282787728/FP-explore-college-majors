2231000,5,B0007QC956,"I just celebrated my 56th birthday and this was my gift
to me.  It's the best gift I could have gotten---the gift of healthy bones and stress relief all wrapped up in one.
Finally a workout for a person in their 50's!  I found this workout to be just right for my needs.  I have been disappointed in the past by videos that were more for people in their 80's and 90's even though the description said 50+.  As a teacher I need something like this to work into my busy schedule and still give me the benefits of a stress-relieving, bone-building program.",1312156800,7,553,4.339805825242719
2231001,4,B0007QC956,"This is a good workout. Thorough and considerate of its intended audience which appears to be older adults. There are three practices on the DVD, each starts from a sitting position. If you are looking for a true yoga approach with meditative pacing, then this is for you. It integrates the weights with slow, gentle movements. i could see it being useful for people with arthritis, an injury or simply new to exercise, or someone who feels uncomfortable in a crowded class, or someone homebound.

If on the other hand, you are of the generation that likes a bit more excitement, then you should look elsewhere.",1302393600,5,611,4.764150943396227
2231002,5,B0007QC956,"i really enjoy this dvd.  it is set up in three 20 minute sessions or do the entire workout in a one hour session.  this was recommended to me by my yoga instructor and i highly recommend it to others.  it teaches you to be flexible, not a pretzel!!!  this is for the normal everyday person using light weights, and a mat. easy and simple steps to strengthen yourself; physically and mentally.",1246492800,12,393,4.416666666666667
2231003,5,B0007QC956,"This yoga dvd gives you basic adaptive yoga asunas using weights to develop stronger bones through extra strength training. Very easy to follow, perfect pacing, with different adaptations for special needs. I highly recommend this for anyone that enjoys yoga and would also like to build stronger bones.",1212105600,5,303,5.333333333333333
2231004,3,B0007QC956,"This workout has value for bonebuilding, flexibility and strength.  However, for those who already have osteoporosis/osteopenia forward bends of which there are many in this workout, are not recommended.  Therefore I would recommend this workout for people who want to build bone strength and flexibility but I would make it clear that it is NOT for those who have osteopenia/osteoporosis.",1189555200,68,389,5.466666666666667
2231005,5,B0007QC956,"The combination of Yoga and weight training demonstrated on this video is great for the prevention of osteoporosis! Strengthening and increasing flexibility!

This video is great. I have been doing yoga for years and this is a good way for me to have a practice that I can either lengthen or strengthen for myself. I also sent a copy of it to my Mom who has never done yoga but expressed an interest in it. The unique way that they demonstrate three different levels of the practice simultaneously makes this great for all levels of experience.",1113436800,11,544,4.666666666666667
2231006,5,B0007QC956,"This video is great.  Twenty minutes is very do-able, but nice to have the option to combine all three.",1110153600,5,103,4.421052631578948
8050449,2,B0007QC956,"After using Susie Hathaways safe strength training and Bone smart pilates, this video  strong bones yoga uses alot of forward bending which is not safe for osteoporosis. I was dissapointed in the video for that reason. But as a yoga video for people without osteoporosis it is fine.",1491436800,6,282,4.875
8050450,5,B0007QC956,"Good advice, I think the reasoning behind holding poses for extended periods makes sense. Looking forward to my next dexa scan.",1484092800,,127,5.095238095238095

8050453,5,B0007QC956,Very helpful as I was having back pain.  The stretching and strength building built on what my pt had me do.  If I did this everyday- my abs and core would be great and I would have no pain.  The difficult thing is of course - the self discipline.  I did it for a month and it was life changing.  Very easy to follow and at first I thought - geez- this is for older people - but it sooo works.  I now finally know how to do yoga breathing.  Please try if you are having back pain or need to build your core- I really think it is amazing.,1440892800,2,537,3.827272727272727
8050454,4,B0007QC956,"I've never seen yoga with weights. It's quite hard at first, but then you are craving more. I'm not sure if she holds the weights long enough to show real definition in the body.",1416787200,,178,4.264705882352941
8050455,5,B0007QC956,"I found this DVD very good for someone who has broken bones, like me, and want to strengthen your bones. Easy to follow, and I think all ages would benefit from it.",1411430400,2,164,4.15625
8050456,5,B0007QC956,"This is my favorite yoga DVD.  I have used it MANY times over the last few years. I love the sequence of movements. I am 60 years old and in good shape, and this is the right level for me.  It is not too, strenuous, but still feels like it is beneficial.  I always feel better after using it.",1385942400,4,292,3.9152542372881354
8050457,5,B0007QC956,"This is a great video.  I previously had it on VHS and had a good, productive workout then as I do now with the DVD.
I know this helps my back and shoulders and overall body immensely.",1384214400,2,184,3.972972972972973
8050458,5,B0007QC956,"I didn't know what to expect from this.  I've never loved Yoga in the past, but I can see and feel that these positions and exercises are working specific bones, especially hips and spine.  I love this program.  If this doesn't help my bones, I don't know what will. Plus, the hour just whizzes by, and I look forward to it every day.",1362787200,3,334,4.26984126984127
