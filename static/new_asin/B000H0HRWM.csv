8135503,4,B000H0HRWM,"The point is that people in the film industry think NOIR was (is) an important contribution to world cinema, that it flourished between 1945 and 1960 and has been of enormous influence to film makers around the world.  Many disagree whether it is a genre or a style or haven't even tried to define it.  By studying the disc I came to the conclusion NOIR is a style that influences lighting designers and cinemaphotographers and directors and commonly has a female character that gets the lead male -a social outsider in a tense relationship with the law - into terminal trouble.",1397433600,2,578,4.712871287128713
8135504,4,B000H0HRWM,"Unfortunately this analysis keeps mainly to Warner films; when the actual genre
is so much wider and deeper and more culturally extensive than any one studio.  Yes?
(Like what about MGM & Universal?) But I know of no other
analytical documentary of ""noir"" that does such an intelligent job covering
this kind of movie -- at least to date.",1391904000,3,338,4.728813559322034
8135505,5,B000H0HRWM,"If you are a fan at all of the noir genre, you will like this.  It is brief segments from several old black/white movies and their stars (Robert Mitchum, i.e.).  Interesting, educational, and, as I said, great fun.",1388793600,3,214,4.605263157894737
8135506,5,B000H0HRWM,Notable experts on the style bring brief commentaries to a collection of outtakes from film noirs which in themslves are worth buying this DVD.,1362873600,,143,5.0
8135507,5,B000H0HRWM,"I highly suggest picking up this documentary on Film Noir because not only does it give you insight on what noir is by many famous directors in the genre, (Including a couple of my favorite Frank Miller and Christopher Nolan) but it also shares with you different movies that show what they were talking about. It was great to learn clear cut what Film Noir was and found many different movies I would like to view now.",1332892800,5,419,4.454545454545454
8135508,5,B000H0HRWM,"This is the best review of the noir genre I've seen. It's selection of scenes and films is right on with excellent commentaries from key directors, authors, and critics. Very insightful.",1327968000,,186,5.032258064516129
8135509,5,B000H0HRWM,"This DVD is an overall winner. The makers of the documentary gathered a terrific group of interviews which are well edited making the entire film very entertaining. (Filmmakers, authors, actors, critics) The variety of commentators provides a broad perspective on the history, context (historical and cultural), influence, and legacy of Film Noir. The filmmakers include opposing opinions from different commentators about the first film noir movie and whether film noir is a genre or a style. This adds to the seemingly unbiased approach. That the participants interviewed all seem to be genuinely interested and excited about Film Noir is infectious to the viewer, regardless of whether the viewer is familiar with the themes or is seeing this film as an introduction. The cover of the DVD looks a bit cheesy but the contents are well done.",1318032000,11,842,5.198529411764706
