7797598,4,1572524324,"While this is not ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Man of the Year"" stands out as one of the strongest films, and very first, of the emerging gay cinema scene in the early 90s.  Intended as a genuine ""mockumentary"", the film follows Schaefffer playing himself as a Playgirl centerfold fairly deep in the closet. Can he, should he, come out? How will his fans react? While this might sound like Vanity exercised while standing in front of mirror, Schaeffer manages to broaden the issue and give it some dimension. Even though he certainly looks the part, Schaeffer avoids the obvious narcissistic traps by and large. The characters are all wonderfully drawn, especially those of his legions of female fans, my favorite being Lady la Flame.  Yes, that is her name.

While a bit uneven in tone, the throughline is credible, the photography/direction skilled, and the acting only unsteady at times. The show is put together well enough that, the first time I saw the film, I couldn't tell if they were serious or not until about 30 minutes in. Except I spent those 30 minutes laughing my butt off.  Many reviewers are disappointed that there is no skin on display to speak of here.  I have to wonder if the more snarky reviews come from those thusly disappointed. Schaeffer's aims were more widely pitched, and he often succeeds. This is a film that demonstrates the problems and pitfalls of living in the closet without pandering or superficiality, in a way accessible even to people completely unfamiliar with the condition.

Most ""gay"" films even today are so dreadful that even gay people don't want to watch them. They are often juvenile film school exercises in navel-gazing, invariably peopled with actors who suffer from a genuine inability to read lines, let alone act. I'm happy to say that this film is in a different league and will certainly amuse and possibly enlighten.",1506988800,,1870,4.846394984326019

7797600,5,1572524324,"It looks like I'm the only person who loved this movie; I enjoyed it more than any I've seen in a very long time, and it's entirely because of writer-director-star Dirk Shafer. It's a reconstructed and partially fictionalized account of his actual experience as Playgirl magazine's 1992 Man of the Year, filmed a couple of years later.

Shafer is amazingly charismatic, intelligent, funny and unpretentious. If it's all an act, he deserves an Oscar. The fact that he's gorgeous is almost irrelevant, because he's so thoroughly appealing in so very many ways. He's one of the few people I've ever seen in a movie whom I'd really love to know, and it has nothing to do with his looks. He's a sweet, smart, articulate, fantastically likeable person, and when he's on screen the movie is always delightful.

I had only two problems with it. I almost quit watching after a few minutes, because I'd expected something like Spinal Tap or Waiting for Guffman, a totally convincing ""documentary"" - which Man of the Year is not. It's painfully obvious from the first words that this is a scripted work of fiction, using some pretty bad (and some pretty good) actors to tell the story. (I got used to the different style pretty fast, though, and it never bothered me again.)

I can't think of any other movie like it, in which a person tells his own story - nearly all of which is almost certainly true - playing himself but using a script and actors to play the other people in his life (there are a very few real people playing themselves, but even their lines are scripted).

That's the other problem for me: I never knew what to believe, what was true and what wasn't. I'm not talking about the facts of his life, the Playgirl stuff - as I said, that's almost certainly all true. I mean his relationships, in particular his relationship with his boyfriend, called Mike in the movie and played beautifully by Michael Marisi Ornstein - the best actor in it, and no less charming and attractive than Shafer is.

Is he real? Those two guys are so amazing that I'd love to think they're really a couple. So I loved the movie, but it left me a little unsettled, almost as if I'd watched a movie about my own life and left wondering how much of it was true. Odd, but wonderful.",1365638400,,2263,4.5503685503685505
7797601,3,1572524324,"Uneven mockumentary from Dirk Shafer that can never quite decide what it wants to be.  It goes on way too long (although it clocks in at less than an hour and a half) and is very repetitive.  Worst of all it makes the mistake of veering away from comedy in the last half hour or so into the realm of pathos and preachiness, as it tackles issues like outing, homophobia and AIDS.  Preachiness is bad enough in a drama, but fatal in a comedy.

Still there funny parts and funny characters, especially Lady La Flame (Rhonda Dotson), exotic dancer and Dirk's self-professed number one fan.  Shafer is sweet and appealing as he struggles to extricate himself from the quagmire of his own making.

Not a bad movie, but not a terribly good one either.",1320192000,,744,4.514925373134329
7797602,1,1572524324,"A tasteless and offensive film that ultimately proves to be a cynical joke played by writer-director-star Dirk Shafer against his audience.  Shafer was the 1992 ""Playgirl"" Man of the Year centerfold who (supposedly) represented the ultimate object of desirability for the magazine's (supposedly) heterosexual readership, but is in reality a gay man.  Having played the role of a straight man in life, Shafer went on to make this film, a fictional documentary about his secret life during the year of his ""reign"".  He's a gay man who pretended to be a straight man who is pretending to unmask himself as a gay man ... get it?  Ha, ha.  Ha.
Very (yawn) funny, except that during the course of the film Shafer keeps touching on some very unfunny subjects: a best friend dying of AIDS; homophobia; gay self-hatred; celebrity stalking; etc.  The big punch line comes at the end of the movie when Shafer confides that his overall objective in making the movie was not to reveal himself, but merely ""to direct""; i.e., to con the viewer into paying to see yet another false presentation of himself.  What an ego!  The film might have had some redeeming quality if only Shafer had been graceful enough to laugh at himself, but he doesn't.  Trust me, there's less to him than meets the eye.  Not even worth a look for Bill Bochtrup (""NYPD Blue"") as the friend dying of AIDS or Mindy Sterling (the Austin Powers movies) in a brief bit as fictional talk show host Cindee.
The DVD includes the theatrical trailer which is presented in widescreen.  The film itself is not presented in widescreen.  Not that you should care one way or the other.",1029110400,6,1630,4.720848056537102
7797603,2,1572524324,"This mock-""documentary"" is clever in that, I'm assuming, it does tell what could be a somewhat 'truthful' story overall.  The problem with this video is that is doesn't know whether it should be funny or serious and this is definately a huge mistake for this kind of project/subject matter.  I personally LOVE dark humor......but this aint it!!!
  Best is the scene in which the mother talks about accepting herself as a fit and caring parent while she was dealing with the homophobic father of a dying AIDS patient on the phone.
  The worst part of this whole video (and frankly I almost stopped watching quite a few times just due to this), are the ""date scenes"", in which Dirk is set up by Playgirl to go on a contest winning date with some supposedly hick gal (bad actress..bad!) who won it.  The scenes never feel real and it's obvious that everyone is over-acting during the whole mess.
  One thing I noticed is that while it's never a great movie and really not good either, overall Dirk isn't a horrible actor and I think he's actually pretty attractive, where as before I just thought he was a pretty boy.  Also NYPD Blue fans will recognize the wonderful actor, Bill Bochtrup, in the role of AIDS patient and ""discoverer"" of Dirk the centerfold.
  I was somewhat entertained or I wouldn't bother to write about it.  BUT, buy at your own risk.  Try to get it used if possible and save yourself a lot of money.  Do Not buy it if you think it's a sex film or you're hoping for nudity all over the place, there's no full frontal nudity at all....sorry.  Peace Out.",1024617600,3,1570,4.51418439716312
7797604,2,1572524324,"While viewing this, you quickly realize that this should have been a ""short"" (10-15 minutes MAX!).  Instead, you end up with a one dimensional joke that's stretched well over 80 minutes.  There are some moments of brilliance and cleverness, but they are few and far between.  It's more of a shameless Dirk Shafer promo piece than anything else, probably because his glory days are over and he has to get a real job.  From the opening shot, you quickly realize that Dirk is getting old, like the rest of us, and that he looks NOTHING like he does on the cover of the DVD box or in the multitude of Playgirl pictures that are shown throughout the film.  His choice of characterizations is quite irritating: the gay activists are shown as bitter queens whose lives won't be complete until they ""out"" him; and for being so in love with his own boyfriend, there are very few moments of genuine caring between them.  As one reviewer mentioned, the AIDS sideplot is pathetic and really doesn't belong in this story.  Must every gay-themed movie have someone dying of AIDS?  Don't people die from car crashes anymore?  Or gunshot wounds?
The DVD itself is sorely lacking.  There are NO extras whatsoever except for a trailer of the film and a scene access feature (they call it ""interactive menus""...ha!).  No commentary, no interviews, not even subtitles for the hearing-impared!  The picture is full-frame; no widescreen is available.  This is obviously another rush job on the part of Fox-Lorber.  Avoid it.",979430400,14,1502,4.81640625
7797605,2,1572524324,"The premise of this movie looked mildly interesting, but in fact what could have been a decent film was botched by it's attempts to bring a touch of seriousness to an otherwise humorous ""mockumentary"".  I have  seen well done films of this type, and this was anything but.  The more the  characters in this film portray the protagonist as a ""likeable,  non-egotistical"" person the less the viewer believes he is, especially  in light of the fact that Dirk Shafer wrote and directed this film.  The  movie leaves the viewer confused, bored and uninterested.  It was not worth  my attention, and is not even entertaining as a bad movie.",958694400,2,634,4.787037037037037
7797606,2,1572524324,"This movie is dunderheaded, offensive, and hot in about equal measure.  Shafer is obviously a dazzling physical specimen, and no doubt that accounts for a lot of the interest in this film, as well as the intrigue of  his sham heterosexual heartthrob status.  However, an intrinsic drawback of  this mockumentary genre is that the joke wears thin pretty fast, and we  soon feel compelled to groan at the same stale, straightfaced antics.  And  when Shafer makes the egregious error of using a friend's illness from AIDS  (in a particularly lame performance by the actor in the movie here) to lend  some poignancy to his slender theme, one may feel compelled to throw  something at the screen.  The obvious self-satisfaction of these laidback,  self-consciously hip types, laughing down their noses at the rubes who  bought Shafer's ruse, grates.  Shafer seems unaware what a sick joke his  feeble movie has become.  His obvious self-absorption and lack of acting  ability doesn't help things either.  One performance does transcend the  generally flaccid narcissism and cheap theatrics:  the woman who portrays  Shafer's mother has a scene where she gets to suggest some of the pain of a  mother who realizes what her gay son has had to go through.  For a moment,  we are lifted out of the sleaze of vanity and lame satire and elevated to  the poignance of true human suffering.",953078400,6,1377,4.934210526315789
7797607,4,1572524324,"This documentary-like movie is about Playgirl centrefold Dirk Shafer and him being gay. Through interviews with poeple around him( frineds, parents, Playgirl editors...etc), we are shown about how he became the *Man of the  Year* and how he got fired because of his sexual orientation. To be honest,  I didn't expect too much from the film. I thought this was just some cheap  low-budget film. But I was wrong!  It turned out to be rather well made,  very heart touching and funny at times. The only complaint I have is the  DVD disc. The transfer is not all that good, and there is no extra  materials. In conclusion, this IS a good film, but not a good DVD disc  though.",944352000,24,672,4.541666666666667
