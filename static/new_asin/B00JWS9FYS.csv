6395378,2,B00JWS9FYS,"I regret buying this DVD.  The acting was dreadful.  The constant wearing of the Sherlock Holmes deerstalker hat looked just silly.  I don't think they meant this to be a spoof, but they ended up doing it anyway.  Some of the overacting was like what we saw prior to the ""talkies""
Save your money.  In my efforts to have a complete Sherlock Holmes DVD collection I proved P. T. Barnum was right.",1410393600,50,395,4.430555555555555

You know what,This was a pleasant diversion to our viewing needs.

Anthony as Holmes is no Robert Downey Jr,But Ironman has claimed Roberts public image and Anthony seems more like Sherlock should be !

The bad guys The Shadow Watchers reminds us of another fringe  flick of genre fare,DARK WATCHERS : Women In Black  A kind of homage to Men in Black films. Both groups are cunning and cool.

6395380,1,B00JWS9FYS,"(Huge sigh) Im not sure where to begin. I do not like to be unkind. Saying that, I cannot find much positive about this movie. I love all things Sherlock Holmes, even the older versions, black and white. From the American version Elementary, to the British BBCs Sherlock. From books, to movies, to documentaries; I like diversity in my Holmes universe. Im afraid, however, I could not find anything likable about this version.

Their idea had promise, but it was not carried out properly. The lighting was terrible, the volume of voices were inconsistent. First, it was so low that it was not audible, then louder. It looked as if they filmed 90% of the film in the same room. Holmes, although he did not look like Holmes, did an all right job acting. It, however, was still amateurish. Also, I am afraid that most of the other actors were not up to par.

Although too late for me, I hope I can help someone save their money. I wish the actors and directors the best of luck in the future, however, in good conscience, I cannot say anything positive about this film, except that it had a deceptively nice cover for the DVD.",1409529600,80,1123,4.5

6395382,1,B00JWS9FYS,I have awarded this film one star because there was nothing lower.  It stands out as the worst Holmesian movie ever. It is an offense against the Canon.  The acting is wooden and the story line foolish.,1497571200,,202,4.4324324324324325
6395383,2,B00JWS9FYS,"Well. I just had to see for myself after reading such terrible reviews--kind of like driving past an accident on the highway and not being able to resist having a look.  If a viewer actually believes this film was meant to be a serious addition to the Sherlock Holmes repertoire, I suggest not making any investments without an attorney present.  My husband and I laughed through the whole thing.  (Yes, we watched it to the end.)  Among the more ridiculous scenes were those featuring Holmes' violin playing, which mainly consisted of him sawing away on the violin's open strings and calling it ""Paganini"".  At one point, Lestrade refers to Pavarotti, which had to be intentional, further leading me to believe that the intent was comedic.

The cast list features a lot of names in common, suggesting a sort of home movie project for a bunch of folks who couldn't make it in the film industry but wanted something to do (perhaps while collecting unemployment?)  Or maybe they were just trying to fill out their resumes.

In summary, I cannot honestly believe it is possible to act so poorly, write so badly, record sound so inconsistently, etc. accidentally.  Therefore, I consider this film to be a comedy spoof.  If I am mistaken, and it was meant to be a serious Holmes tale, then God help these delusional people.  (Perhaps the D. P. In Anthony Mann's name?)",1497139200,3,1363,4.757446808510639

6395385,1,B00JWS9FYS,"After barely being able to get through the first few minutes, I checked the other reviews.  Apparently the rest of the movie is just as bad.

6395386,1,B00JWS9FYS,"The entire production of this feels like a bad film school project. I stopped watching after the first ~10 minutes because it was clear that it wouldn't improve and it is a disgrace to a great character. The editing was off and had poorly timed cuts where they didn't trim enough from the beginning of a take which exacerbated the poor acting. The acting was terrible and the first conversation with Holmes, Lestrade, and Watson was unbearable. Very much overacted and the entire cadence of the conversation was unnatural. Beyond the amateur acting, directing, and editing this also suffered from a lack of technical skill. The lighting and white balance changed from shot to shot. The audio wasn't balanced and changed from shot to shot. I am actually amazed this made it through production.

Overall this was a very poorly executed production that ruined any chance of the story being worthwhile. Its as if they spent most of their considerably low budget on the cover art and left nothing for the actual production of the film. Don't waste your time with this and certainly don't spend any money on it. If anything, watch this as a lesson in how to not make a film.",1492905600,2,1168,4.7254901960784315

6395390,2,B00JWS9FYS,"I take it that this is an amateur production of some sort?  If so, it must be judged accordingly.  Firstly, script problems.  The Church of the Immaculate Trinity?  Not only was the scriptwriter apparently not Catholic, he or she apparently wasn't even raised Christian and didn't bother to do much in the way of research.  Likewise, his or her knowledge of history seems somewhat lacking.  This is supposed to happen in 1890 yet a priest who looks no more than forty served as a missionary in America and suffered at the hands of the Iroquois in his youth?  Really.

The concept is intriguing, the reporter with an apparent foreknowledge of the murder (though not very foresightful himself, apparently, for it not to have occurred to him that this might raise, erquestions), and hooked my interest early on.  The following execution wasn't too bad.  The climax reminded me somewhat of an inverted The Seven Dials Mystery by Agatha Christie.  Like most amateur films (if that is what this is), the production quality is poor but not terrible, especially for a period piece.

Many have knocked the acting.  Part of that, I think,  is that the production made no effort to cast the lead in the image of most actors who have played  the venerable Holmes.  Nevertheless, he wasn't bad.  His casting reminded me of that of a woman with a pronounced contemoprary NYC accent portraying a Star Fleet captain in a fan fiction film, seemingly an odd choice but somehow effective. The actor who played Lestarde grew on me after awhile, another unorthodox choice for the part with his Yorkshire or Scottish accent and somewhat scampy  manner.

One gets what one pays for.  For this sort of production, about average.",1489363200,,1704,4.83044982698962

6395551,1,B00JWS9FYS,"This was so incredibly awful that I couldn't watch more than about 7 minutes.  The opening ""grabber"" was dreadful and boring.  The opening credits indicated that this movie was actually created with the licensing from the Estate of Conan Doyle, but Arthur must be rolling in his grave.  (Perhaps we should have a sance, to ask him?).

In any event, RUN, do not walk, from this movie.  It's worse than most of the ""made for sci-fi"" student film experiments that are run on that cable channel.  It makes most made-for Lifetime movies look positively like cinematic blockbusters.  The music sounds as though it was cobbled together from free music sites on the web--by someone who can't hear AND is tone-deaf.  The staging and the acting couldn't be worse.  At the very first scene featuring the protagonists, when Watson finds Holmes lying on the floor, you're waiting for the ubiquitous ""As you know, Bob..."" scene, in which one character tells the others facts that they already know, that the scriptwriter is trying to tell YOU, the audience.  As soon as (the AWFUL) Holmes started to say ""as you know, Watson, you don't have the medicine that I want.."" I hit the KILL KILL KILL button on the remote.  Okay, well, not KILL--I simply turned it off.

Actually, that's not a bad idea. If we had remote buttons that would administer electrical shocks to filmmakers that inflict this type of dreck upon us, I suspect that the quality of filmmaking would rise to new and vastly improved heights.  Perhaps we should start up a IndieGoGo account, to raise money for that very invention. Want to see a project REALLY take off and get funded?  That one would soar.

So--you've been warned. This isn't even that ""so bad it's fun""  type of movie.  (Like The Queen's Guard, or whatever that movie was, with Jason Lewis, Eric Roberts and...Ron Perlman, I believe?).  Run, run away, and save your brain cells for another day.  You'll thank me.  Your brain cells will thank you.  Your eyeballs will get down and kiss your toes, for not scorching them with a film of this caliber of awfulness.",1472256000,,2077,4.729805013927576

6395589,1,B00JWS9FYS,"It's so bad that it isn't even campy!  I watched parts of it because it's offered for free as part of Amazon Prime. For some bizarre reason, Amazon lists Ian Brannan and Rick Cairns as the stars. Mr. Brannan had 1 line as the morgue attendant (rather badly delivered) and Rick Cairns played the role of Cardinal Alverston, who, as one of the bad guys, commits suicide.  Actually, I'm not sure if he commits suicide because he's a bad guy or because he's so embarrassed at how bad the script is and his own lack of acting ability!

Holmes is portrayed by Anthony D. P. Mann; a Google search provided this information: [...] Anthony D.P. Mann is an actor and director, known for Canucula! (Dracula in Canada) (2008), Terror of Dracula (2012) and Phantom of the Opera (2014).  The ""Phantom"" is a ""modern"" interpretation with a group of paranormal investigators hunting ghosts......[you can Google this and see a short video of the movie, which doesn't look any better than this one! Yuck!]  Mr. Mann's acting range runs all the way from A to - at a stretch - B.

Watson is played by Terry Wade who also has a limited bio: ""Terry Wade is an actor, known for Snuff Box (2006), Terror of Dracula (2012) and Sherlock Holmes and the Shadow Watchers (2011).""  And somehow, I don't imagine he'll be getting any Oscar nominations any time soon.

Now for Richard W. Kerr who portrayed Lestrad.  Where did they find this guy?? He was even worse than Mann and Wade! I kid you not! You can tell he was really trying, it's just that this fellow is NOT - repeat: NOT - an actor! Maybe the guy that they'd originally planned to play the part got smart and didn't show up so they grabbed one of the camera men or crew and said, ""Wanna be a star?"" and threw him in front of the cameras.

And while I'm not trying to beat a dead horse, even the sound wasn't good -- the fellow who Lestrad arrested speaks so softly that you have to crank up your speakers to hear him only to be blasted by the other actors when they speak. It's more like a homemade movie - really amateurish.

Overall, if I could have given zero Stars, I would have.  And for all of those 5 Star reviews? I think they  had to be friends and family of the actors. There's no way anyone over the age of 6 could honestly think the acting was anything other than miserable. BTW, the bio on Ian Brannan says that he's back in college studying journalism. That's a clue that this guy is probably the smartest of the group! He's moving on and getting away from anything Anthony D. P Mann is involved in!",1468627200,11,2542,4.371549893842888

I read some of the reviews prior to watching and cannot agree with the reviews that unfortunately compare this to community play house theatres.

This Sherlock doesn't have the usual arrogance of the Sherlock breed, so I found it interesting to consider how different a feel it gave. In fact, ALL the characters were portrayed different to form. But, what was most interesting, and which however cinematically dark other Sherlock movies try at showing the depravity of certain villians, this humble little skit and the message contained within it, will be the Sherlock Holmes story that I will most remember as showing the layers of hidden evil within our societies. It did not exploit ""victimization"" as so much does these days to try to gain authenticity nor make evil doers any more monstrous than they are.  Take it as the play that it is. Expect 1930's black & white film and method acting.  And, then be surprised with the story.",1446854400,,964,4.7604790419161676

The fellow who played Holmes seriously did not have one idea of how to approach the character.  He seemed to be trying to look thoughtful and introspective but it just did not work.  The budget for this Canadian production must have been whopping $5000 pounds and the rest of the production team and film staff must have been family and friends.  The Holmes actor, Anthony D.P.  Mann directed the movie.  What type of direction he gave that fellow playing Lestrade must have been quite fascinating as Lestrade was the most bland policeman with a ""oh well I need to catch the bad guys I guess "" attitude.

6396066,1,B00JWS9FYS,"What a terrible 'movie' this is. I highlight the word 'movie' not because it's so awful, which it is, but because it's only an hour long. I suppose you can call that a movie, but it's more like a television episode in regards to length.

The movie is actually available on You Tube in its entirety. If Amazon will allow it, I have pasted the link below. Warning! This movie sucks on ice!! As others have pointed out, the actor portraying Holmes looks nothing like the Holmes we fans know and love. Short, pudgy, very un-Holmes like, and that's the sort of bad casting that seems prevalent throughout the flick. If they can't cast Holmes properly, they certainly can't (and don't) cast the other regulars with any degree of integrity or competency.

The actor playing Inspector Lestrade is so unlike everything we've seen and read about him that he's almost unrecognizable. Even worse, his acting is atrocious. The Lestrade of the books and movies is at least authoritative, if not a bungler, but THIS Lestrade is just dopey and has a whiny, Scottish accent. The actor playing Watson isn't that bad, he just doesn't look the part and, when taken in conjunction with the Holmes and Lestrade characters, doesn't resonate as Dr. Watson at all to me. The entire 'movie' seems as though it was cast by Saturday Night Live as an intentional parody of the Holmes movies.

That all being said, the actor portraying Holmes isn't a horrible actor, but he's not great either and doesn't resemble the Holmes we've come to know in the least.

Here's the link to the 'movie', if Amazon will allow it. If you can get past the constant commercials, the lousy casting, the less-than-mediocre acting and the amateurish production values, more power to you!

Peace.

In spite of an intriguing, if somewhat melodramatic (and thoroughly uncharacteristic) beginning, I can't get past the first ten minutes, firstly because my mind refuses to believe that the character purporting to be Holmes is the same character in Conan Doyle's novels, but mainly because Lestrade's portrayal is bad on a level that English has no words to describe. Beginning with the scene depicting Watson's return to 221B, there is absolutely nothing that makes this feel like a Sherlock Holmes story, in spite of the fact that the film time is overflowing with rapid references to Holmes details. There is no way this movie can be called one of the worst ever, indeed, if the production wasn't claiming to be related to the great body of canon and pastiche work that has sprung up around Sherlock Holmes, I think I'd probably go ahead and watch it all the way through, but because it presumes to associate itself with Sherlock Holmes, I find it utterly unwatchable.",1429488000,6,1374,4.681818181818182

Fun if you're watching a play; a bit jarring on the big (or small) screen. As for the actors; the one playing Sherlock was completely wrong for the role on so many levels... besides looks and build; ham comes to mind.  Watson and LeStrade were also badly miscast.
