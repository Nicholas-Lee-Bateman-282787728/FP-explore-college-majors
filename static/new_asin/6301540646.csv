A quick Google search of ""exercise video with Javier and Becky"" provided the name of it and Amazon provided the source.  The routine is just over 30 minutes which is perfect for my busy schedule and the leader, Stacey Benson, is great.  Her cues are perfect and her routine is well balanced.  I had the tape converted to digital format so now I can watch it on my computer.",1499990400,,547,4.323529411764706

7812872,5,6301540646,"I bought this around 1990, got rid of it when clearing out VHS and recently purchased it on VHS again.  It is a bit dated but it is one of my favorite workouts. It is about 40 minutes and has a brief standing toning session (plies, stationary lunges) and a fantastic floor leg/glute (lots of leg raises and lifts) and ab section.  No matter how many times I did this, I always felt the burn in my legs and abs.",1195171200,3,410,4.1125
