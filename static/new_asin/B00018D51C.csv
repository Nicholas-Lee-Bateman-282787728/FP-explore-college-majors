More comments are paltry. Buy this DVD and all of the DVDs with her performing. You will feel the majesty of art in dance like an apparition.",1422921600,,275,4.729166666666667

8007690,5,B00018D51C,Maya Plisetskaya sets her own standard for a beautiful ballet performance.  We are so fortunate to have so many of her performances on DVD.,1388793600,,139,4.791666666666667
8007691,5,B00018D51C,"An excellent documentary on the life and career of this great dancer
in which we are also treated to some rare footage of her childhood,
early career, family life and  performances in roles that made her a
ballet legend.
Monochrome filming only enhances the dramatic power of Plisetskaya's
incredible life and - even more - incredible dancing.
Interesting for those who like Ballet but a MUST for the collector.",1376611200,3,411,4.956521739130435
8007692,4,B00018D51C,"As usual the Bolshoi fails to come to terms with the personality of individual Russian dancers. Plisetskaya is an impenetrable and remote goddess. And remains so, thanks to the Bolshoi managers.",1375315200,,194,5.290322580645161
8007693,5,B00018D51C,"THIS IS A HISTORY OF BALLET AND BOLSHOI THEATHER.  I GIVE IT 10 OUT OF 10.  EXCELLENT, YOU HAVE A TICKET TO THE BOLSHOI.",1349049600,,120,3.9583333333333335
8007694,5,B00018D51C,Be prepared to be amazed!  In this video Ms. Plistetskaya shows rare footage of some of her finest performances.,1264291200,6,112,4.894736842105263
8007695,5,B00018D51C,"I saw Plisetskaya dance Carmen in Moscow in the 70s - she was much more than just a prima ballerina, she was a force of nature, a tornado, an earthquake. She was also a very smart and intelligent professional - she knew better than anybody else that lyrical roles were not her forte and she never tried to be anything else than her volcanic explosive self.

This DVD contains several fragments of her theater roles, a whole performance of her famous ""Dying Swan"" and several rather long interview moments. Translation from Russian is quite good and the additional ""bonus"" is that you can still hear her precise controled voice and see how that tight control is mirrored in her incredible poise. The final fragments from Don Quijote - the only ones that are in existence - still make me gasp and shiver when she literally explodes onto the scene and makes it impossible to see anything else except her capricious, proud, bitty Kitty. It is impossible to compare her to anyone, it is as if she curves the space around herself into a vortex and becomes a whirling pulsing center of everything on the scene.

My eternal regret is that Soviet Union never thought to make several full length TV or movie recordings of her best roles, it is such a waste. Ballet lovers might wait at least another century to see another chance of such a combination of nuclear temperament and fantastic skill.

It is a sad irony that this documentary can be purchased at Amazon but is totally impossible to buy in Russia. I suspect that there are hundreds or even thousands of such treasures from the 60s and 70s slowly desintegrating somewhere in the archives of the State Fund of Cinematography...what a waste...",1254182400,22,1690,4.702702702702703
8007696,5,B00018D51C,"The only problem with seeing dancing like this is that it may intimidate others from even trying.  How ironic are the subtle ways of the makers of this documentary trying to enhance what was already magnificent--whether by altered film speeds, edits, or particular lighting, as if the truth did not speak for itself.  Produced as a piece of Soviet propaganda, touting Russian accomplishments during the Cold War, the makers of this documentary simply couldn't chance that you would not see what you, dear viewer, no doubt can--an extraordinary dancer.  As it is, today these defects are merely amusing. May future dancers simply be inspired.",1203292800,18,641,5.144230769230769
8007697,5,B00018D51C,Her Kitri in the Don Quixote excerpts is absolutely amazing.  Why is there no DVD of the full-length production available?,1177459200,13,122,5.1
