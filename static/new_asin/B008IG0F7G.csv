5167206,5,B008IG0F7G,"It is about time this excellent series was finally released on DVD. What a gem! Now, I remember this series growing up, but when it aired, I was only 10 years old. I always enjoyed the action (always a fist fight), and some of the more subtle things might have gone over my head. But, seeing it again made me realize that this show more then stands the test of time. The characters are timeless and really do stand up. Many posthumous kudos to John Vivyan and Ross Martin as Lucky and Andamo and to creator Blake Edwards.  In fact, in my opinion, much better then PETER GUNN and I think that series is still good and was also created by the talented Mr. Edwards. MR LUCKY is better overall. You gotta LOVE the cars alone !!! Another great thing is that each episode is a tight half hour episode telling the story and accenting it with action at the end. I've heard some say that the plots were a little shopworn, but I disagree. It was just the nature of the character of Mr Lucky to have friends AND enemies always knocking on his door. It added to the somewhat mysterious past of Lucky who's real name we never learned and whose past was never really revealed. Perhaps more would have come out if there was a second season. Now, in this day and age, it's hard to imagine that this show was a bona fide hit and not renewed. But,in those early days, networks really did care about what people thought. In the South Bible belt, there were complaints that the series glorified gambling and so much pressure was applied that the sole advertiser, Lever Bros, demanded that gambling been taken out in favor of a dinner club. The series complied, but at the end of the first season, Lever Bros pulled out and, incredibly,CBS could not find another sponsor for the show to continue. It was a top twenty show for the year !! That would never happen today and as such, the show went WAY too soon. But,nonetheless,it's really good to finally have this vastly overlooked program in as pristine as you're going to get it. This IS the best collection I have seen of this show, having stupidly bought a couple over the years which all sucked compared to this. The picture is really very good throughout with just a couple a little dark,but considering the nature of the series,it doesn't really work against your viewing pleasure. The sound is also very good, with only the episode, ""BUGSY"", where the voices sound a little tinny and strange. But, basically, the audio is excellent, loud and clear. That's a real plus because the musical soundtrack is a classic!! The music was a standout by the great Henry Mancini and the show also produced not one, but TWO, hit LPs, MR LUCKY and MR LUCKY GOES LATIN. And they STILL canceled it !!! However, with this wonderful set released by Timeless Media,they added a bonus disc,the LP MR LUCKY for your listening pleasure. This is a fabulous buy no matter how you look at it.",1350950400,39,2902,4.496212121212121
5167207,4,B008IG0F7G,"I enjoyed Mr. Lucky while it was on, but as someone else said it wasn't the greatest.  However, I still enjoy Mancini's wonderful music from the series so that is definitely worth 4 stars just because it was there.",1350950400,2,214,4.487179487179487
5167208,4,B008IG0F7G,"I recently ordered this set from Barnes & Noble. As you know, some of Timeless
Media Group's series, have been less than good. This one however, makes it.
The picture quality is very good, and the audio is even better. The only reason
I didn't give it a better grade is because some of the episodes are a little
darker than others. But the picture is crisp, no jumps, no dirt. A worthwhile
purchase.",1350864000,41,399,4.405405405405405

5167210,5,B008IG0F7G,"What a gem of a series and what a shame it only lasted one season because of ""sponsorship issues"". John Vivyan is just fantastic in the title role and what a shame that his career nosedived after this to the point that he wound down in Hollywood as a largely forgotten bit part actor in the campy Batman series. Ross Martin plays off Vivyan perfectly and the chemistry between the two is a huge plus. The great Mancini theme song is just icing on the cake for this great nostalgic ride back to the days of great, quality television. The picture and sound quality on the dvds is very acceptable considering the show dates back 55 years. Those complaining about the prints should keep that in mind and not expect HD quality after all of this time.",1447459200,3,745,4.445255474452555

It is so very refreshing to find a quality collection for this all-too-short-lived TV series. The show itself was well scripted and acted with many surprise guests who we all grew to know over the years. The quality in audio and video is excellent and the extra soundtrack is a terrific 'present' included for us to enjoy.

5167248,5,B008IG0F7G,"This is a great half hour show from 1959. John Vivyan and Ross Martin make a great pair in this Noir type tv show. I like this just as much a Peter Gunn. The plots and stories are done very well. The action is always top notch and the transer to dvd is well done. I didn't know about this show until I saw an episode on MeTv then I was hooked. Funny how a lot of great shows from the late fifties and sixties only lasted one season. This show wasn't cancelled due to low ratings but rather certain groups of people objected to the  gambling casino on board the ship three miles off the U.S. coast as part of the story line so the show was dropped because the sponsers backed out. Mmmm,,,I wonder if this was the same group that said married couples on tv in the fifties could only sleep in single beds with a lamp in between them during any bedroom scenes.

There was, however, a caveat to that effect, so I was not expecting a high quality item.  Still, it was very reminiscent of the days of 30+ episode seasons plus summer re-runs, so unlike today's TV programming.

5167255,4,B008IG0F7G,"Seeing this show as a kid about the only thing I remembered was the animated cat before a commercial was shown so it was almost like seeing the show for the first time. Four stars may be to high for this show because many episodes pass and there are unanswered questions. Is Mr. Lucky a secret agent?criminal?former criminal?Playboy? someone that is just a good gambler?  Let's just consider the subject of his being a playboy...suave,cultured,rich women interested in him,has $100,000 on his boat during an era when a blue collar worker didn't make $5,000 a year but for some reason in several episodes he seems to have a girlfriend that is so-so looking and not too bright,doesn't figure.....Other flaws in the writing are trying to mix comedy with murderous gangsters to the point of having fight scenes  with music that sounds more fitting for a circus clown act. This is terrible stuff for someone that likes the untouchables,highway patrol and Coronado 9.....The show did settle down after about 15 episodes .Mancini music is great,like the animation at the program start,guest stars like Jack Elam were in top form. All in all difficult show to score. A regular character on the show is Lt. Rovacs, at first he was annoying but I got over that because only a pair of glasses are needed and you have Louie Andersons father.",1380844800,,1329,4.824561403508772
5167256,5,B008IG0F7G,"This series finally got the re-do it deserved for being one of the most infectious, late-50s, series that sadly, was short-lived. The picture for the most part (exception in the opening pilot episode with Nehamiah Persoff and the next one)is well-contrasted with good sound. Why would you want to botch the incredible soundtrack of Henry Mancini, so exceptionally cool and swinging as a martini on a hot night? The series was well controlled by Blake Edwards throughout, with scripts so sharp and dead-on you feel in just 25 minutes that you experienced an hour. When I first saw this series, I thought it had run over 3 years. The camaraderie between Mr. Lucky (John Vivyan) and his compadre (Ross Martin) is unequalled and much imitated throughout the following decades. In fact when Ross Martin was in ""Wild, Wild West"" 6 years later, on occasion, he lampooned what he did so smoothly in ""Mr. Lucky."" You will see the likes of Jack Nicholson, Richard Chamberlain and Barbara Bain (pre-Mission Impossible)and Gavin Macleod if you are so observant. In fact, the resemblance of John Vivyan to Cary Grant was so obvious, cleft chin, tall and handsome, so comedic that I thought he was Grant. Unlike Grant, who disdained violence as a last resort, both Vivyan and Martin get very physical in every episode in cuffed tuxedoes most of the time, almost Bond-like. (another imitator: The Saint)The other signature mark restored in this collection is Lucky's pulled stopwatch that signaled the call of Lucky in each episode. All in all it is a supreme joy to see and hear this stylish series that stands apart from the many series to come (Starsky & Hutch, Miami Vice) that never quite reached the flair and sophistication of this Blake Edwards charmer. Action, adventure, danger, gun play, gun molls, gamblers, grifters they all make their parade in the action aboard the Fortuna II, for awhile a gambling casino, then later, a bona fide restaurant-at-sea.

5167266,3,B008IG0F7G,"The Mr. Lucky series suffered a problem midway when producer Blake Edwards  was forced to change the lead's floating casino  to a floating restaurant. Edwards had created one very successful series, Peter Gunn, with a lead who resembled the actor Cary Grant in dress, haircut, voice pattern -- bottom line, every way legally possible. Mr. Lucky was based on the Cary Grant film of the same name. In it Grant operated a gambling ship. The actor portraying the TV Lucky, John Vivyan, isn't quite as successful as Gunn's Craig Stevens at aping Grant, but he is properly droll and rugged, and he has the added advantage of Ross Martin's comedic backup as his nearly omnipresent assistant Andamo. That works well until the powers that be knuckle under to the anti-gambling  complaints and take the edge off the series by converting the boat to a night club-restaurant. Still, it's fun seeing youthful actors (like Jack Nicholson) pop up on their way to stardom. And those early shows are worth a look.",1361750400,13,996,4.847058823529411

5167272,4,B008IG0F7G,"This series I purchased without ever seeing one solitary episode for a few reasons. It's another Blake Edwards creation who created one of my other favorite series Peter Gunn.  The music again like Peter Gunn is done by Henry Mancini. The styling of Blake Edwards for this show is the same stylish quality although different from Peter Gunn. Also the costar is Ross Martin who played Artemus in The Wild Wild West. I never new Ross Martin did any other tv series besides West and he was a great actor. The star John Vivyan as Mr. Lucky is a good actor too  and these episodes are complete. This show ran for one season. I have not seen all episodes yet but I have liked each one I have seen. This show aired 1959 to 1960 black and white half hour shows. The stories move quickly and there is action a plenty in the ones I have seen. If you really like the old crime shows of the 1950's to 1960's era, and if you are definitely a Peter Gunn fan, you won't be dissapointed, you can't beat the price for this set and I believe you will appreciate this show as a short addition set to go along with Peter Gunn.",1359504000,17,1106,4.23696682464455

5167274,5,B008IG0F7G,"Several television series have stayed close to my heart through the years, going all the way back to my earliest days. Two in the sophisticated crime caper vein that dominated my life during late grade school were Peter Gunn and Mr. Lucky. (Later, T.H.E. Cat would  form with them a personal holy trio.) Fortune has now smiled and made Mr. Lucky available in a full run. The quality of the transfers is uneven and not what I'd call excellent, with occasional distortion and cuts in picture and audio, but it's all good enough for me. Although the stories often hinge on coincidence and improbabilities, I always found the story telling to be excellent, with engaging and memorable characters experiencing frequent reversals of fortune that occurred in delicious ways. The combination of drama with an overall tone of light-hearted joy was and is irresistible in its somewhat Damon Runyonesque tone. My main complaint is with respect to packaging: The four discs are arranged in two pairs, each pair socketed to one side of the interior with one overlapping the other. Thus, if you want play the disc that's underneath, you have to first pull out the one one top, keep it safe and take out the desired one, then keep it safe while you put back the first. Oh, and to top it off there is a compact disc of music from the series which is loose in a paper and plastic sleeve. But all this aside, I heartily recommend this set, technical and packaging shortcomings and all.",1358640000,4,1467,4.708171206225681

I bought a Sony bravia last summer and I have motionflow problems on a few things that I didn't have before, so I am unsure as to the source. Timeless Media product is always dicey, with ""Arrest and Trial"" and ""Restless Gun"" suffering the worst fate, and ""Johnny Staccato"" representing their best efforts. I'm holding off on purchasing the complete ""Peter Gunn"" set until more customer reviews come in. There is no print at all in the box, no info as regards order of release of the episodes.

5167283,4,B008IG0F7G,"I give Mr. Lucky four stars, because the single season series never really found a consistent stride. As an actor John Vivyan as Lucky demonstrates far less charisma than Ross Martin as Andamo - a character with a single name created for this series. Martin was an excellent character actor convincing no matter what type character he performed. Again Blake Edwards is the guiding hand with a credit as supervising the entire production of every episode. It is loosely based on an RKO movie of the late 40s that starred Cary Grant - the film based on a short story titled ""Bundles for Freedom"" set during WW 2. It may have been that he was testing his humorous side before branching out into The Pink Panther movies because the humor - for my tastes - diluted the more serious plots. In the beginning Mr. Lucky operated a gambling ship beyond the 3-mile limit. These episodes offered the more dramatic plots. Then suddenly - whether through network interference or whatever - Mr. Lucky soon became owner of a high class restaurant now located in the harbor of yet another unnamed city. A number of era character actors graced the 34 episodes, including future mega-star Jack Nicholson. In the same episode is Richard Chamberlain. Henry Mancini provides the soundtrack music with the theme the most memorable of the score. Timeless Video Group produced and released the series using the best archive material available, but with a caveat some sound & picture quality may be off. I found a single early episode in which the sound was a bit tinny. Otherwise the black and white image and sound are fine.",1355011200,2,1600,4.7797833935018055
5167284,5,B008IG0F7G,"The release of Mr. Lucky continues the welcome trend of releasing shows from the early 1960s that only lasted 1 single season.  Others include Wide Country, 87th. Precinct, The Gallant Men and The Lieutenant, all recently released.  I remember watching Mr. Lucky when I was 10 or 11 years old.  I read that it was broadcast on Saturdays, but, for some reason, I seem to recall watching it on Friday nights.
The show is based on the old Cary Grant film about a gambler and his casino, located on a yacht that he won.  The star of the show John Vivyan, looked good in a tuxedo and resembled Grant even down to the cleft in his chin.  (He also resembles George Lazenby, who played Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.)  His buddy Andamo is played by a young Ross Martin.  The show was produced by Blake Edwards, the noted director who directed Breakfast at Tiffanys and The Pink Panther among many other films.
The show is most remembered for the great music of Henry Mancini, who also scored Edwards' other, more successful, tv series Peter Gunn.  I actually prefer the music of Mr. Lucky.  The theme music always makes me think of a nightclub or casino, about one or two in the morning, during the 1950s or early '60s.  Which I guess is appropriate considering the plot and time of the tv series. I think Edwards also used Mancini's music in just about every one of his films.
Anyway, for whatever reason, Mr. Lucky only lasted one year.  The only other thing of note that I remember Vivyan doing is starring in a grade B western with one of the most ridiculous titles I can ever remember: Rider on a Dead Horse.  Edwards must have liked Ross Martin since he cast him as psychotic killer Red Lynch in his classic suspense thriller Experiment in Terror.  He also used him in his epic comedy The Great Race.  In 1965, Martin gained lasting fame co-starring, as Artemus Gordon, with Robert Conrad in the classic tv series The Wild Wild West.  Sadly, he died prematurely of a heart attack.
I've watched the first three episodes of Mr. Lucky and they've all been very good.  Considering Timeless Video's checkered history, the picture quality has been very good.
In conclusion, Mr. Lucky is a solid and enjoyable half-hour adventure series with nice guest stars and great music.  If you remember and love that period of tv the way I do, I highly recommend it.",1354924800,6,2357,4.5738095238095235

5167287,5,B008IG0F7G,"The cool, suave John Vivyan is superbly cast in the title role of this late 50s classic.

He is the man without a first name, known simply as Lucky or more formerly as Mr Lucky.

Ross Martin plays his sidekick Andamo, the man without a surname.

He is the Pancho to Vivyan's Cisco; the pair is on a continual rollercoaster ride that takes them from one adventure to another.

The scenario is simple; Lucky runs a casino on board a ship anchored just outside the state's jurisdiction.

For reasons that are never explained Lucky turns his floating gambling palace into a restaurant about half way through the series.

The passing parade of goodies and baddies features a host of guest actors highly familiar to viewers of programs from this era; Peter Gun, the Twilight Zone and Have Gun Will Travel.

One episode even features from an ultra-young Jack Nicholson.

Jack Arnold's direction is deft and in keeping with the artistic values of the era and Blake Edwards, who is credited as ""overseeing the entire production"" keeping each episode running smoothly and logically.

The great Henry Mancini's music is a treat to behold; this must be one of the first series to feature an all jazz soundtrack.

The picture and sound quality are in the very good range save the first episode which is a bit iffy.

Mr Lucky, the complete series is a must have for aficionados of the genre.

Sample a few episodes and you will become beguiled by its naivety and charm.

You'll wonder why they only ever made the one series.

8528486,5,B008IG0F7G,"Peter Gunn was pretty cool back in 1958, but then I was 12 years old. Watching the series today is entertaining, the theme music still cool, but sure bears a lot of questions I didn't ask when I was 12.  Is Lt. Jacoby the laziest cop in the world or what? He sits in his office, which doesn't resemble anything connected to a police squadroom, and reads a paper waiting for Gunn to come along and solve all his cases for him. How does Mother's nightclub make any money when it is smaller than my livingroom (and I live in a 1,580 sq ft house with 3 bedrooms and two baths) and she supports a trio and a singer in addition to her bartender? Lola Albright is nice to look at, but as far as a singer goes, her doing McArthur's Park would sound just the same as her singing the Stones' Satisfaction or Presley's Heartbreak Hotel. Her voice sounds like it's the same tone no matter what note she sings. Gunn, the police, the bad guys, they all drive the same make of automobile. Where the heck was GM and Ford? I still like Craig Stevens as Gunn, and the fact that the actor was married to the same woman for 49 years until her death gives him five stars in my book.",1491350400,,1161,4.183035714285714
