2680186,5,B000JYW65O,"this show was clean, educational, had a diverse cast, great animation, and great story-lines. It was funny, perfect for girls ages 3-10, and enjoyable to our whole family.  the music was great, the messages were wholesome, and it taught lessons such as healthy eating, sharing, caring for pets, etc.",1217548800,,299,5.1020408163265305
2680187,5,B000JYW65O,The great thing about Charlie and Lola is that we enjoy watching it as much as the kids do! Love the music and graphics. Our kids create imaginative games based on the stories and get all sorts of craft ideas too.,1217030400,,213,4.219512195121951
2680188,5,B000JYW65O,"This is a great way to get kids to see what it should be like to be siblings and how to be when your the older one. They are great shows to watch for kids it keeps them intertaind. Great shows, Grand kids love these two. Holds their attantion.",1214697600,,243,3.979591836734694
2680189,5,B000JYW65O,"I love the tv show and am totally happy with this dvd. My kids adore it and watch it without interruption. The lessons that are given in the story line are wonderfully done with a childs perspective, much easier for little ones to make out what it right and what is wrong. Thankyou Charlie and Lola!!!! You can do everything thats anything all on your own!!",1210636800,,357,4.424242424242424
2680190,5,B000JYW65O,"My son watches Charlie and Lola on Playhouse Disney, and he's always enthralled with Lola's silly, innocent antics and their lovely British accents. We also have several Charlie and Lola books, which are equally whimsical.

Volume 3, My Little Town, does not disappoint!

Here are the six amusing stories found on this 72 minute DVD:

*I can do anything that's everything all on my own
*There is only one sun and that is me!
*I've won...No I've won...No I've won
*It wasn't me!
*Say ""Cheese""
*My Little Town

The Special Features include:

*A snap game
*Funny outtakes
*Hidden surprises

(If you win the snap game, you unlock a CD ROM for playing cards to print and make.)

This release also includes English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired (but subtitles are also great for children to learn to read!).

If you're looking for a benign cartoon series for your youngsters, you can't go wrong with Charlie and Lola. Unlike many shows geared to children, this DVD doesn't move at breakneck speed, feature dumbed-down dialogue, or include snarky characters or meanness.",1185494400,12,1077,4.911602209944752
2680191,5,B000JYW65O,My child and I really love Charlie and Lola due to its innocent and funny nature.  Its got an excellent sense of family and imagination.,1183420800,,136,4.44
2680192,5,B000JYW65O,"This is why I love Charlie and Lola. Out of the first three DVD's I've watched, this one is my favorite. Definitely worth the money. I think very highly of any cartoon that doesn't portray a bad guy or extremely bad situation and yet is far more entertaining than what is commonly seen on our American TV. It's the every day stuff that brings out the creativity in kids. Nothing spectacular happens in Charlie and Lola and that's what is so endearing about it.",1182816000,,460,4.488095238095238
2680193,5,B000JYW65O,"My daughter loves this cartoon, but before she ever started watching it, my husband and I feel in love with it.  Charlie and Lola are great examples of sibling interaction and they have so much fun together!  You will love this show, the great British accents, and so will your child!",1174953600,2,284,4.549019607843137

2680209,5,B000JYW65O,Charlie and Lola are one of those few shows where you can at the parents watch along with your child and not be bored or offended. it is smartly written and the two child voice actors do a wonderful job portraying the characters. The story lines are simple yet they have heart and address concerns children have in everyday life. My 4 year old daughter can happily watch these dvds over and over again and I can be happy knowing she won't be exposed to violence or the general hyperactive stupidity that occurs on today's kid shows.,1372032000,2,532,4.494845360824742
2680210,5,B000JYW65O,Not the crazy cartoons kids watch these days Charlie and Lola are sweet and kind... also their accents are darling.,1368748800,,115,4.8
2680211,5,B000JYW65O,I have bought several of the Charlie and Lola DVDs because my grandkids love to watch them.  There's nothing scary in them and they always (hopefully) learn a lesson.,1368489600,,166,4.724137931034483

2680213,5,B000JYW65O,"My son started watching this show about four months ago and he loves it. I love it too, it's not the typical kids show. Plus he gets to learn about their culture! I will be adding more of the videos to his collection for sure!!!",1358380800,,228,4.088888888888889
2680214,5,B000JYW65O,"Charlie and Lola has to be one of the best television series for children. It is fun, bright and colorful - captures my children's attention immediately. The show focuses on great life lessons such as sharing, helping others, learning new things like different ways to make music, eating your dinner, going to bed, etc....

My boys have learned so much from this show - they really love it - I'd recommend it for anyone with young children 7 and under - mine are 1 and 3 and they are hardcore fans!",1259280000,,498,4.472527472527473
2680215,5,B000JYW65O,"My two and a half year old sits mesmerised at Charlie & Lola, he asks for it continuously and has even started to speak with an english accent which I am sure won't last!  One thing worth mentioning is that even with it on in the background, for some unusual reason, none of it begins to be annoying to adults and it can be left on in a loop safely without fear of danger to parent's sanity.

He took it into his day-care and displayed it proudly to the other kids of similar ages (My 11 year old sits equally transfixed at this DVD and at the younger one's attention span!) and the staff there reported similar interest with all the kids there.",1242604800,,645,4.235772357723577
