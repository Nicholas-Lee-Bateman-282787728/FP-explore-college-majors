2269584,5,B00097DXFS,"I saw this old Tyler Perry story years ago, and I never stop admiring the acting, the cast, and the story line about a beautiful young woman who is devastated by her husband's callous demand for a divorce, but finds love again in her life.",1522454400,,239,4.333333333333333

2269590,4,B00097DXFS,"I liked the movie a lot.  It was more of a dra-medy than a comedy or drama.  Though, one thing that irritated me in the movie was the wife constantly saying, ""Charles...Charles...charles""  when he never said her name once.  It became so irritating.  Otherwise, it's a movie worth watching.",1521331200,,289,4.816326530612245

2269598,2,B00097DXFS,My movie is showing very bad and skipping many parts,1516233600,,52,4.3
2269599,1,B00097DXFS,"I'm pretty much in agreement with most of the other one-star reviews, so I'm not going to repeat them. However, I'll add a comment of my own. There are several instances of vengeful action in this movie, which all Christians know (or should know) is against God's will. Especially disturbing to me is the part where the wife is brutally abusive to her paraplegic husband, physically, verbally, and emotionally. To be sure, he'd been a huge jerk to her and deserved it. But she was on the edge of losing control, and could have easily murdered him. It was vicious and ugly. I don't see any value in going that far in a movie, even if you're trying to be realistic; the scene could have shown her acting in a more responsible manner. As violent as our society has become, we shouldn't be showing that kind of ugliness.",1515369600,,816,4.52027027027027

 It is realistic. The story is touching, accurate and at times nothing less than hilarious!

It shows how a woman faces and heals from abuse. It does not happen overnight, it takes time. It takes some good people around her and she has to take one day at a time. There is no quick cure from abuse. The laughter offsets the intensity of the movie, it is so well done.",1486684800,3,471,4.211111111111111

This movie makes you cry, laugh, angry, mad, renewed, and forgive.  The power of forgiveness releases you from becoming bitter and angry.  The character 'Helen' found herself during her greatest tragedy.  She didn't know she had the strength to survive until everything was taken away from her.  The whole cast was amazing.  I'm grateful for Tyler showcasing Cicely Tyson so that the younger generation of actors can experience her amazing talent. My favorite scene is the last church scene where humility, repentance, & restoration takes place and the singing always brings me to tears.  Good job Tyler!!!",1440547200,,737,5.075

2270031,4,B00097DXFS,"This was my first Tyler Perry movie that I picked up quite by accident at my local video store (when there still were video stores) and I have seen just about every one of his movies and plays since.  It introduced the public to Medea, one of the funniest characters in recent history who makes repeat performances and delivers.  It was a romantic comedy, of course, but we have just enough comic relief and dramatics in it to make it something that mass appeals.  I am not the target audience for this (I'm a white woman in my 40s who has never been married nor do I have kids), but things spoke to me in this movie.

After 18 years of marriage, Helen is shocked and horrified that her husband Charles is ending their marriage and leaving her for a woman named Brenda who he has been cheating with and fathered two children with.  Kicked out of their house with no where to go, Helen takes her U-Haul truck (which Charles had packed for her with all her stuff) to her grandmother in the city of Atlanta, Medea.  Medea, a thuggish, rough gal, takes her in because even though they have not spoken to each other in many years, are still family.  Helen starts to rebuild her life slowly but surely, getting a job as a waitress and going through her divorce in court with Tyler Perry acting as her attorney.  There are some predictable things that go on (she and the driver of the U-Haul, Orlando, are going to fall for one another and give her a second chance at love) and some subplots (her attorney Brian is dealing with his drug addicted ex wife and his kids), but we are focused of course on Helen and her dealings with Charles.  Just when she is about to give her answer to Orlando in his proposal of marriage, she sees on the news that Charles had an accident and is confined to a wheelchair and goes to him.  She is, after all, still his wife and is legally responsible for him.  Charles has been abandoned by Brenda, along with all his money, and he realizes his mistakes with Helen.  Helen does forgive him, but she knows that their marriage is over once and for all and leaves for greener pastures.

This spoke to me on many levels, especially the relationship between Helen and Charles.  He is a self centered, greedy man who does not appreciate what he has until he makes a terrible mistake.  Instead of coming clean about his own faults, he lashes out at Helen with verbal and emotional abuse, both in the end of their marriage and when they are reunited after his accident.  I have seen this happen so many times with men.  Some argue that women go for Bad Boys as well.  Well yes, that's true, but just as many men try to make it work with trash instead of a good woman.  How many guys have I seen, young and old, leave their spouse or girlfriend, a good woman who is edgy, fun, hard working and exciting, for a trashy woman?  You as a man look pretty ridiculous if you leave your wife for a twenty year old stripper, I'm just saying.  This has happened to me more times than I care to think about now.  Fortunately I have never been married to these guys, but the next one who comes along they rebound to within six months to a year and they keep it dramatic and crazy.  One married another woman barely a year after he broke it off with me (after knowing each other for six weeks) to have her take advantage of him financially (moving to another state and buying a house there and paying for her daughter's education), and then leaving him for another man she was cheating on him with.  And I hear him say all the time that he made a terrible mistake in leaving me.  Yes, he did.  But this is something that I think a lot of women have to accept which is not pretty - that men want trash instead of a good woman.  Sounds bitter of me, but I have seen this in action too many times to think otherwise.

Medea is great as the comic relief, she seems to be able to tell people exactly what she thinks and never get into trouble (save with the law).  She is the voice of reason.",1425254400,,3989,4.281333333333333

2270143,5,B00097DXFS,"Tyler Perry wrote an awesome movie, and put together a fantastic cast. This movie made me laugh, cry, and shout for joy! The chemistry between Kimberly Elise and Shemar Moore made their characters come alive. Every time he kissed her and spoke encouraging words to her, it reminded us of what love should look and sound like.  It gave us a glimpse of how God loves us and his desire is to make us happy. When he says to her, ""I can't give you what you are used to, but I will love you pass your pain"", my heart leaped. It reminded me of when Peter said to the beggar that sit by the gate, ""Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have I will give to you"".

2270182,5,B00097DXFS,"When I had originally heard of this movie, at first glance I thought it was going to be one of those movies were the acting was over-dramatic and the plot would be as if it was written by a middle schooler. As I was surfing my channels with nothing, I had saw it on t.v so I thought, why not.

The movie had definitely proved me wrong. The plot was well thought of and looked as if it took time to think of it. The acting was superb. Kimberly Elise had done a fantastic job at her role, portraying a woman who was thrown out of the house by her egotistical husband, and is trying to start over. Shemar Moore hit spot on with his role as a white collar worker Orlando who was originally hired by Helen's (kimberly) ex husband to take her away. The chemistry between the two actors really made me believe as if they really were in love.

Moore and Eilse both did a fantastic job in this movie, and they work amazingly together!!",1390780800,,926,4.196629213483146

Madea was not the ""Mad Black Woman,"" Helen was; although, a rather subdued character. Helen kept her cool and channeled her anger in positive directions. This movie was more of a drama about Helen than it was a comedy about Madea. Overall, this was a decent combination of the two genres. It does become a little ""too"" religious at one point.",1377043200,,489,4.50561797752809

Vengence belongs to GOD, that point was expressed in the movie.

2270232,4,B00097DXFS,I was expecting more parts with Madea being more of the dynamic character but she wasn't (Goes to Jail and Witness Protection are by far the best). This does however have some pretty funny moments so I'd still watch it.,1367798400,,219,4.5

2270234,5,B00097DXFS,"This is another good Madea movie.  It is not appropriate for all ages, mostly small children.  But Madea movies do have language, but they also bring church and God in them also. That's what I enjoy most about them.  I enjoy seeing a big black woman tell people off too.",1367020800,,270,4.36
2270235,5,B00097DXFS,This movie has you laughing and crying at the same time. You see a dark side then it flips to a light side. It's a womans movie for sure. A woman can see it and feel empowered afterwards.,1366761600,,187,3.9473684210526314

It used black stereotyping which I felt was inappropriate and was just plain dumb, won't watch any more of the Madea movies.  I had been told by friends that this was so funny, but I just didn't see the humor in it and the storyline in my opinion just didn't support a two hour movie.",1365811200,,341,4.074626865671642

I had seen Diary of a Mad Black Woman before, but watching it again made me realize that I did not like AT ALL the way that black men and women were portrayed in the film. I am not usually a fan of Tyler Perry's work, so maybe I am biased. While it was funny at times, I thought that some pieces of the plot were unrealistic. To someone who is unfamiliar with the structure of Black life, some of the ideas expressed may lead to racist ideals towards Black people. Again, maybe this is because I viewed the film from a critical academic lens. To someone who is watching the film solely for entertainment purposes, it might be enjoyable.",1357171200,,749,4.39568345323741

Kimberly Elise and Shemar Moore gave poor performances; Of course, Tyler Perry playing three roles simultaneously was just as bad and I despise him; Cicely Tyson, of course, gave a disgraceful performance  helping her daughter become more whorish even though she herself has been wronged; I have heard the bad and the wrost about this movie; I have heard that Madea is just another stereotypical role model that we need to get away from; let's be honest, very little of us can attest to a Madea in our family? or know a man that dresses like a woman? This was one movie that sex and profanity splashed forward and yet, the critics my people loved it; Yes, I found it a bad movie, and can all of those who supported Mr Perry opening weekend be wrong? I think so; Look forward to the day the Jesus comes down from heaven and kills any man who is dress like a woman.""Deu 22:5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so [are] abomination unto the LORD thy God."".....P.S don't watch this movie true children of God",1353542400,,1288,4.411764705882353

2270305,5,B00097DXFS,"This 2005 film version of Tyler Perry's stage play, directed by Darren Grant gives viewers a complex look at the African American demographic in modern-day Atlanta through the eyes of a woman named Helen McCarter,played with skillful range by Kimberly Elise, with Perry himself in three roles as the sassy Madea, her brother, Joe, and Helen's cousin, Brian.
  We meet Helen and her attorney husband Charles(Steve Harris) on a grand night in Atlanta society where Charles receives an honor for his work. Despite the evening of toasts, tributes, compliments, and an evening on the ballroom floor, by the time Helen's husband drops her off at their mansion to return purportedly to his office, we know, as Helen ascends the porch stair case looking like a queen, that there are serious cracks in the facade.
 In the course of this film, we see Helen's attempt to salvage her troubled 18-year marriage met with spite and contempt from her husband, who has a new woman in his life named Brenda(Lisa Marcos), whom,as it happens, has already given him two children--a fact upon which Helen literally stumbles when she tries to have lunch with Charles at his office.
 Shortly thereafter, U-Haul worker Orlando,(played with great intelligence and sensitivity by Shemar Moore) witnesses the devastating scene of Helen being thrown out of her own house by Charles after a bitter confrontation with Charles and his mistress there. The U-Haul trailer is packed with Helen's things and Orlando is instructed to drop Helen off whereever she wants to go. After driving around for sometime, a still reeling and devastated Helen is asked to decide where to go by Orlando, who must get to his second job. She decides to go to her grandmother Madea's house, and this is where the comedy and the drama of the story will combine.
 When Helen arrives, she is also reunited with her cousin Bryan's estranged wife Debrah(Tamara Taylor), an addict to whom Madea is giving some food before sending her back on the street.
 Madea is naturally outraged by what has happened to her granddaughter, and the following day, goes with her to the mansion while Charles is out, and leads Helen in ripping up the mistresses' high fashion wardrobe. Charles and Brenda confront the two of them, and there is dramatic license taken in an outrageous scene with a chain saw, which lands both Helen and Madea in the slammer until they are bailed out by Brian.
  Placed under house arrest, Madea entertains family and friends at a gathering at her home where a woman named Mildred(Carol Mitchell-Leon) joins Uncle Joe in smoking reefer during a card game, and both see rabbits in a hallucination.
 Soon this is overshadowed as the guests line-dance to music, and Helen, wondering how to get her life back together, is reunited with Orlando and taking her bitterness out on him because he knows her shameful situation.
  Helen also visits her mother(Cecily Tyson), relegated to a nursing home, especially since Charles did not want any relatives around him. The religious elderly lady gives her daughter a gentle pep talk, encouraging her to tap into her own strength in the wake of her reversal of fortune. Amid hilarious moments of antagonism from Joe and Madea's sharp and riotous retorts, Helen takes a job as a waitress, and gradually finds some personal happiness. She sees Orlando again when he is a customer at the restaraunt where she works, and they gradually begin dating.
 In the meantime, a shady deal Charles made with a client slowly comes back to haunt him. In due time, his estranged wife's observation about how ""God has the power to show you that He is God!"" will be vindicated in a way in which he will never forget.
 We also follow Brian's family situation, having to raise two kids(Tiffany Evans, Avery Knight) by himself due to their mother's substance abuse, and Madea's urging him to let his daughter join their church choir, advising him that just because his wife's singing career led her to drug abuse does not mean the same will happen to his daughter.
 A dramatic turn of events sends Helen back to Charles just as Orlando was about to propose to her, and Charles will find that within those 30 days in which their divorce is to become  final, Helen is all he really has left. But for Helen, this is the occassion where 18 years of pent-up rage come to the foreground and her own personal version of what was referred to as ""Operation Hell's Fury"" in ""The First Wives Club"" is fully enacted.
 Madea's reflections on revenge are another high point of hilarity in the story. In the finale there is some reconciliation where there needed to be. But, ironically after a church service, the once mad black woman whose journalistic recordings are the staple of this story makes a dramatic decision with her life for which no one could honestly blame her.
 While many have complained about the sterotypical characters involved, this piece is one that depicts certain realities of life that take us through the whole gamut of human emotions with humor and style.",1342224000,,5038,4.839534883720931

A young, beautiful woman who is married to a lawyer literally gets thrown out of her home as her husband has all her belongings hauled out to a moving fan. Heart-wrenching as a distraught woman, once rich thrown into the streets just before she's introduced to her husband's New Flame with children.

Woman thrown out of her home like a piece of trash-not funny. (Just for the record-she didn't clean, cook etc etc-you know all those things she felt she should be compensated for)

Drug addiction- not funny.

Blatant humiliation and physical cruelty to a paraplegic. not funny

As a love story, the movie contains no sparks. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural,
It's a cheap melodrama.

A drag act, a drug plunge, a soap opera, a sitcom revenge fantasy.

2270311,3,B00097DXFS,"I think this movie could have been so much better if it waren't for the main leads. The opening scenes of the movie are quite terrible and soap-operish. Kimberly Elise is really weak as the female protagonist. Instead of coming across as the sympathetic victim she comes across as almost inviting the ill treatment. If I were her husband, I probably would have treated her the way he did too. She's pathetic and a completely one dimensional character. I wasn't convinced by her sudden bursts of anger and rage later on in the movie either- the acting wasn't great. The same applies to the man who plays her husband. He gives a very flat and one dimensional portrayal of his character. I felt bored just watching him.

That said, the saving grace of the movie is Madea (she's a scene-stealer) and the other characters- including Shemar Moore, who unlike Kimberly Elise is convincing as his character. I LOVE the romance between these two. Tyler Perry really knows how to get into a woman's head and create a feel-good movie. The story line was also interesting and with better leads, the movie could have made a stronger statement.

After watching For Colored Girls the movie that Perry Directed. I thought I would give his other movies a shot since Kimberly Elise was in the movie her performance in For Colored Girls was so moving.

I decided to rent this movie in hopes of an interesting story and extraordinary acting performances. After watching I saw the characters  are boring and cliched. it felt like this movie is unorginal

I was not pleased with the movie overall. I did not like the main character she was to weak for me.  I did not belive her to be a mad black woman I understand her problems but I did not get anger from her character.

I kept thinking about Eddie Murphy in the Nutty Professor films as Perry does play  multiple roles in the film all I could think was Eddie Murphy did a better performance then Perry with that in mind i stopped watching the movie midway. since I watched half the movie i am giving it two stars.",1299715200,2,955,4.331460674157303

2270351,5,B00097DXFS,"Last Summer, a friend of mine recommended Diary of a Mad Black Woman. She said after watching it the first time, it immediately became her favorite movie. I can see why; her marriage of over 20 years ended very much like the character Helen's marriage.

I recently watched it again for the twentieth or so time with my family over the 4th of July weekend. When I asked my sister what she thought about the movie, she said she had trouble sleeping because of it. She said she kept having different scenes go through her mind. To me, that really says the movie was right on the mark.

I highly recommend the movie. I have to warn you. It is not for the faint of heart. It vividly displays a side of humanity some of us have unfortunately seen. It shows how cruel, heartless and self-centered some people can be when they walk out of a marriage. The truly troubling aspect of this is how horribly these people treat their spouse who in many cases has invested so much time, effort and love into their marriage. It also shows how these people eventually have to face what they have done to someone they professed to love and promised to protect.

Madea provides her wisdom and humorous take on the situation at hand. Madea is so important to this movie because without her it would get depressing and her frank take on the situation at hand earns this movie a full 5 stars well actually more if I have my say so!

2270355,4,B00097DXFS,"This is Tyler Perry's first film, which is actually directed by Darren Grant. (Perry's first movie, in which he directed, is Madea's Family Reunion). This is a solid movie which wonderfully portrays a naive black woman who is heartlessly taken advantage of by her husband of 18 years.  Suddenly a veil is lifted in a wonderfully acted scene, which plays much like a play, where the woman's naivety and innocence are brought to her own attention and she loses all control of her reality.  We watch as the woman, scarred from her ex-man, sheds her stereotypes of black men and begins to trust them (in her case a potential love interest) for who they are, not what they are ""supposed"" to be.

Perry knows woman well.  He also knows men: the good and the bad (who he is proud to write, are still worthy of forgiveness). Perry is also a wonderful character actor as both Madea and Uncle Joe are very funny.

I wasn't disappointed however. Yes it was slightly predictable and the make-up wasn't that great. You couldn't disguise Tyler Perry's lower lip and chin with all the make-up in the world but I had to admit Madea did get funnier and funnier as the film went on.

My favourite bit in the movie was the speech Helen (Kimberly Elise) gave after her husband became disabled. The passion in her voice and that feeling of sweet revenge was so convincing.

The second thing I loved was Helen's clothes. Oh the clothes! From the burgundy eveningwear that turned out to be her rival's to the cool summer halter-neck dress, made good viewing for me.

I wasn't crazy about Orlando's corn-rows or about how unrealistic some of the scenes are but then its comedy - not meant to be taken too seriously but to be enjoyed and for a laugh. Four stars from me.",1193443200,,995,4.642045454545454
2270362,4,B00097DXFS,"""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" is a flick about a couple who have been married for many years (played by Steve Harris and Kimberly Elise.)  On their wedding anniversary, the husband decides to tell his wife that he doesn't wish to be married to her any longer and that he found someone else.  In doing this, he is very curt, succinct and blatantly rude to her, even going as far as dragging her out of their home since she refused to leave.  Throughout the movie, the wife has a very difficult time copping with her husband's cruelty.  She is forced to move in with a family member, the always wild Mable ""Madea"" Simmons.  The wife pretty much remains composed, even after the breakup, but of course, with the help of Madea, she gives her husband a piece of her mind a few times, something he deserved.  She eventually finds someone else who is interested in her, but she is having a very difficult time with losing her husband.  Many of the scenes in this movie are quite emotional and heartfelt.  Some scenes aren't easy to watch.

The husband is shot in the movie and is temporarily paralyzed.  His new girlfriend no longer wants to be involved with him but his wife opts to take care of him, but she gives him quite a hard time in the process.  Near the end of the movie, she leads her husband to believe that she wants to reconcile and get back together, but in the end, she chooses the man who she was dating after her husband left her.

Kimberly Elise is a good actress but for some of the scenes in this movie, she was too reserved.  She should have been more explosive during certain scenes.  Steve Harris did a fantastic job with his role.  Shemar Moore also did well, as did Tyler Perry.

I recommend this movie for those who want to see a bittersweet movie with quite a few laughs.  It's a keeper.",1191801600,,1807,4.362275449101796

And Martin Lawrence working the fat suit too? A couple of women friends of mine saw this movie, and I ended up going to see Madea's Family Reunion in the theatre and being very pleasantly surprised. I finally got around to seeing this on DVD and I have to give props to Tyler for having enough vision to take his ""chitlin circuit"" musicals to the big screen.

The hooks draw you in. You immediately care for the black woman wronged. Madea's get mad and get even message from Tyler Perry in his fat suit. Tyler Perry as Joe cracking about Madea's ""refrigerator in her behind"". There's always a laugh around the corner.

What makes this film a little stronger than I expected was that it successfully draws on messages of black family without being aimed at a purely churchgoing audience. Sinners will smile a little bit more at some of their churched relatives. Saints will be moved by the struggles for salvation and forgiveness in the movie.

The plot is not always tight. There's a bit of heavyhanded foreshadowing at times and there's a sideplot with the lawyer's crack addict wife that probably adds some unnecessary running time. Still, I give Tyler credit. This is first time out of the box and I think that he learned a lot from this movie in making an even stronger Madea.

Tyler's an amazing entrepreneur and a caring playwright who makes a bold move in this movie. Check this one out and strongly consider buying it.

And I am a black woman whose husband has done some wrong things to me too, so I understand black women and what we do when we are hurt or angry.  That said, the play was excellent.  I loved watching her roll her incapacitated husband around the house, making him starve, spitting on him, etc.  Loved it.

When I heard this movie was going to hit the BIG SCREEN I was excited.  Tyler Perry's stage actors are always on top of their game, and I just KNEW that the people he put in this one would be beautiful and the acting would be on point.  Flat out people, it wasn't.  The plot was good, the storyline kept you interested in seeing what would happen next, but I felt like I was watching another BBM (bad black movie) half the time because the acting wasn't as good as I needed it to be.

That said, hit the no button now, lol.  But I did like the movie, because I like seeing movies about women especially learn about what they are and are not strong enough to go through, and about people learning themselves.

And of course, I love Madea.  Who doesn't?  And I loved seeing her on the big screen for the first time.",1152576000,8,1231,4.2094017094017095
2270387,4,B00097DXFS,"I quite liked this movie.  It isn't ever going to be an absolute favourite of mine, but it's very entertaining because it has a good mix in it of comedy, drama, revenge, passion and good old fun.
Kimberly Elise was OK in this (I think it would have suited either Angela Bassat or Vivica A Fox better) and her deliciously evil husband (Steve Harris - The Practice and Heist) was excellent.  He was so mean and you knew he'd get what was coming to him and he sure did.  He was just lucky that his soon-to-be-ex wife was so kind to him inspite of what he'd previously done to her.  Kimberly's character did make the right choice in the end (very predictable) and it was very An Officer And A Gentleman at the end.
To take the cake was Tyler Perry.  He's so funny - even I as a white chick can get his humour and his delivery.  I especially love the scene in the new girlfriends closet.  Hilarious.
This is a really good movie that should have wide appeal because it's got everything in it.  There is a big lesson to learn in it and it will also entertain you again and again.  I highly recommend it.",1151020800,4,1096,4.230769230769231

2270390,5,B00097DXFS,"Ok, this could be scary to some people, but hear me out. I am not black, and furthermore, I AM NOT A WOMAN!! So, was it wrong for me to watch this with my wife and love it as well? The credits rolled, we took in the special features, and we came to a stunning conclusion. That conclusion was that this movie was the best investment as far as movies go, within the last 2 years! And to be honest, I've had my eyes on it for close to six months before finally giving in and laying down the money and taking my chances.

So first and foremost, I want to express my thanks to the sister in Christ that recommended this to my wife and us. I admit that I had at least a couple of reasons NOT to take my chances with something like this. First of all, I looked at the cover, and I took a deep stare at it the way a strict grandparent might look at the cover of a ""Weird Al"" Yankovic CD! I admit, I thought it looked totally KOOKIE! But then there was my own past. When I was younger, and not too tame, my choices in movies were the likes of ""New Jack City"" or ""Boyz in Tha Hood"", along with all the Van Damme Stuff that guys like. That was simply because I was stupid and into some foul stuff, such as N.W.A., Ice Cube, Dr. Dre. Yes, I have quite the past, and nothing's going to change that. The fact of that matter is this... Christ changed me. You take the time to view this, and you'll see that only part of this is the point of this movie that had my wife and I in stitches, and close to tears at times. I saw one constipated review of this, where somebody said that this was perfect until Tyler Perry made his introduction as Madea and Joe. WHAT?!? Tyler Perry, along with some imperfection is what specifically made this more than perfect! What, you think that adding an R rating and Kimberly Elise and Shemar Moore banging away for half the film is going to make this perfect? Some people need to broaden their horizons just a little. And for those of you who STILL don't like it, I have some news for you... I LOVE IT!! Read on.

This was something special as we watch the saga of Helen unfold. She gets an unexpected surprise for her 18th anniversary, and then some from her husband, Charles! You will meet my two favorite characters in this, Madea and Joe, two of the craziest relatives you will ever want to meet, and want to love. Sometimes you have to rip things apart just to feel better, like Madea suggests. (watch the movie!) By the way, they are both played by Tyler Perry, as well as one other character, and YOU have to figure that one out for yourself. We also meet Orlando, a fellow who has been hurt in the past, and takes a special interest in Helen. You will meet a lot of people in this, and it will grip you. Let me give you a fair warning... once this has it's grip on you, don't try getting out! It won't work, ok?

This also has the powerful message of forgiveness, combined with unconditional love! Oh my goodness! As you can plainly see, I can't say enough about this. I think I'll go for a few more lines, amen? So while this have a moment or two of sadness, or the occasional ""What the hell?"", set them aside!! And when you see this at Blockbuster, or wherever you rent your movies, put aside your preconceptions about this until you actually WATCH IT! I probably should have, because I've been missing one of the best movies out there for about six months. Only get half a glass of beverage, and maybe half a bowl of popcorn, because they'll go flying when you start laughing, yet bring along some tissues, just in case. Now, quit reading this and go out and get it.",1146873600,3,3595,4.192196531791907
2270391,4,B00097DXFS,"...at times this film made me want to. Of course I found problems with this film--namely the Madea caricature. Oftentimes, I felt as if I were watching two different films at once. And while Madea was only in a few scenes it was sometimes distracting from the seriousness of the plot. Another problem I had with the film was some of the dialogue. There is a line where the character Helen (played by Kimberly Elise) talks about her new beau Orlando (played by Shemar Moore) in a diary entry and mentions that not only is he beautiful and sensitive, but he's a Christian too! Quite frankly, it just sounded somewhat childish and ridiculous to me.  Oftentimes, I felt like I was watching a soap opera because some of the dialogue and scenes were so melodramatic and over the top (especially the overblown ending church scene, which left much to be desired) that I was wondering when they were going to bring in the violins--and in fact I think they actually did.  At times I felt that parts of the film were too contrived and maybe a little unrealistic.  I found it hard to believe that a man as drop dead gorgeous as Orlando (Shemar Moore) would be lured by or even be remotely interested in Helen (Kimberly Elise), or that a man SO good looking would be celibate, thoughtful, considerate, sensitive, understanding, or as insightful as he was.

But..on the other hand...

The film's cinematography was stunning--and the acting was top notch.  Kimberly Elise is not a favorite of mine but she is very talented and always delivers.  Steve Harris (The Practice) is highly convincing and does well with what he has to work with.  He is a VERY good actor and I hope he gets more opportunities in film.  Tyler Perry's no slouch and displays his acting chops (when he's not in drag or portraying some other caricature) very effectively and with ease.  And Tamara Taylor does her best with the material. But most astonishing, was Shemar Moore of all people, who actually CAN act (a little bit anyway..though I attribute some of his effectiveness to director Darren Grant). I remember when he was on the soap opera The Young and the Restless and my roommates in college would just swoon over him.  I on the other hand, just saw him as another pretty boy with no acting ability whatsoever getting by solely on good looks.  Times change.  And while I personally still find him highly annoying, his performance as the sensitive and understanding blue collar worker who falls for Helen IS believable.  He made me want to believe in fairy tales (well...at least where he was concerned anyway). I hope in the future he (Shemar Moore) becomes more mature and chooses more challenging roles where he can rely on his talent and not on his good looks.

Overall I thought this film had some serious limitations, but when I got the film I wasn't expecting a masterpiece--if I wanted that I would have gotten Gone With the Wind.  But for better or worse, this film kind of had a magic to it and for some inexplicable reason...I like it.",1145750400,4,3013,4.645951035781544

Kimberly Elise and Shemar Moore create so much chemistry together, heightened by the story of the ex-husband, and then the movie turns into the Nutty Professor gone bad.  I can deal with the Nutty Professor, because it tells us that it is a comedy with Eddie Murphy doing all sorts of crazy things with the family.  That's funny.  But when a serious drama, and very good drama (that's why it gets two stars), tries to add in this vulgar grandmother-like character, well then the movie just becomes ridiculous.  Especially when that old, cross dressed lady starts wielding a gun and shouting obscenities and how she ""Ain't scared of no po-po.""

I cannot find Scripture that supports cross-dressing nor any such intepretation by any mainstream Christian churches.

Whether or not you can relate to the issues they face in this movie, you'll still be able to laugh until you cry and enjoy the characters.

2270415,1,B00097DXFS,"First of all, let me just say that, why is it that most black films are the only ones that can preach about ""JESUS"", without offending anyone? Anyone ever think about that? Most 'white' films about Christianity are Roman Catholic influenced. Rarely will you ever see or hear any 'white' preachers, in a 'white' film, even use the name of Jesus. But black films can get away with it. Well, i applaud the intention and motives of Mr. Tyler Perry...but i have to say, he sent the wrong message with this farce.

The film revolves around the character of Helen McCarter, and her abusive marriage to a one time drug dealer-turned lawyer. He gets a girlfriend and kicks her out of the house...after 20 years of marriage. Thru her cousin (played by Tyler Perry), she befriends a handsome young man that sweeps her off her feet. Before the film ends, her husband gets confined to a wheelchair. His girlfriend leaves him and he needs his wife to take care of him...which she does, unwillingly. She wants revenge and gets malicious on him (He's paralyzed from the neck down). She then learns from her mother and grandmother (also played by Tyler Perry), that she needs to forgive him. She does. All seems well, especially after they all attend church together, and seemingly start anew. After church they're all at the grandmother's house having a nice soul-food meal, and she get's up and tells her husband she's in love with another man, and walks out the door. The film ends with her in her new lover's arms. Now, if this is what Tyler Perry thinks is a Christian message of a movie, then I've got news for him!? The Bible says that a Christian woman that has an unbelieving husband, should stay with him and be submissive. Her Godly and Loving character may just save him. Nowhere does it say that we should leave to go find a 'better' lover. It does say a man can put away his wife, but it's not taught as the best thing to do.

I just feel that Tyler Perry is sending the wrong message with this film. Her husband cried and repented in church. She hugs him and cries with him and they worship God together. Then she runs out the door and into the arms of another man??? Excuse me, but that's just wrong.

 Not only that, but parts of this film were very vulgar and distasteful. It's not really what you'd want your children to watch. Drug usage, shooting, sexual innuendos...not really a family film. There were some very funny scenes, and much of it was entertaining ( i don't know which came first, this or the Nutty Professor films, but one of them is a rip-off of the other...at least Eddy Murphy didn't use Christianity as a crutch). Overall, i cannot recommend this one.  You'd be better off watching something else.

Unfortunately, I like Mr. Perry much more than I liked this mess of a movie. I love to laugh! Didn't laugh much in the first 40 minutes or so, which is the amount of time we waited until we just turned the thing off. You don't ""buy"" the premise from the git-go -- this beautiful rich woman being physically dragged out of her house by her rich mean husband, instead of merely being divorced by him, is a ridiculous scene that set me up to disbelieve and be confused by the entire rest of this mess.

2270422,1,B00097DXFS,"According to the review by Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, ""...this touching story is invaded by the Grandma from Hell, who takes a chainsaw to the plot, the mood, everything. A real chainsaw, not a metaphorical one. The Grandma is not merely wrong for the movie, but fatal to it -- a writing and casting disaster.""

Ebert was right about that!

However, I found the movie to be a huge disappointment for me because of the fact that the storyline didn't stay truthfull to what the movie was all about, the character's narration from the diary.  About 30 minutes to the end of the movie, we don't hear anymore about what the female lead character is thinking.  If the narration would have stayed truthful to the premise of the film (a la ""Goodfellas"" or ""Taxi Driver"" ), it would have been much better film.

Instead, this film focused on the wrong characters.  The Grandma played in drag by Tyler Perry was horribly acted.  Perry should be taken to the back and shot for micro-managing this potentially great film into a total mess.  Perry wants this film very badly to be like Richard Pryor in ""Which Way is Up?"" or ""Soul Food"".  Maybe if Perry took his creative hands out of the cookie jar, it could have worked.

The sad part about this film was it really could have been so much better.",1127606400,13,1296,4.523605150214593
2270423,5,B00097DXFS,"I feel you have to be Christian or a Good Samaritan to really get this movie.  In life, you have Realists or Romantics.  Christianity is a Romantic theme.  You need faith and imagination to even begin to understand Christ--and to love him.  In fact, the Marriage Feast of the Lamb is a very ""syrupy-sweet concept"" and complete joy, if you can persevere past the cross and such, to have the right to receive such undeserved love.

Anyway, this movie is a comedy about a cross section of African Americans and their traditional values.  I find many ""New Generation"" people who are ignorant of and/or despise the truth about blacks and just want it all to go away.  These ""realists"" believe that they can take education and make everything better with whitewash.  The truth is that privileges don't erase who or what a person is in their hearts.  Moreover, some people never could or would deny their culture or who they really are for any amount of money or prestige.  But then again, there are those who would gladly sell their souls for success.

I am African American. I was born in 1954, and I graduated from USC in Los Angeles.  I feel I have a fairly firm grasp on reality.  My father was a career soldier when I was born, and we live a Middle Class/working class lifestyle.  My neighborhoods were predominately white since I was born.  In the 60s, this was a privilege for blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities.  We were the first groups to have ""governmental protection,"" and had more choices than being Uncle Tom or Aunt Jemima.  I remember well the difference between acting black or acting white.  I guess I acted white.  To me it was just a communication tool.  But it was well accepted wherever I was.  I did not betray my race.  I was just who I was.  And I know of many African Americans (some in my parent's families) who REALLY acted black, like Madea (Tyler Perry's cross-dressing character).  And I LOVE them.  Church, aggressive behavior, strong family ties, all this is black culture, without the whitewash.  I applaud Mr. Perry for an entertaining/informative take on African-American culture that includes everyone you are likely to find in the ""black community,"" (which continually widens and deepens) and gives credibility to both old school and new school black America.

I think many of the people who hated this movie are 1) ""oreo"" blacks, who feel shame because of unsophisticated black culture, 2) pseudo-intellectual whites who are uncomfortable with cultural differences in others . . . that totally rejects white assimilation,  and 3) people uncomfortable with Christian themes that plumb the depths of human sins and prevails by Faith, Hope, and Charity. The scorned wife was only human in her abuse of the evil husband while he was disabled.  He deserved it. But she pulled out of that mire of hatred and proved that God is Love and, if you love God, you will begin (in time) to show love for even your worst enemy.  Agape is vehicular in the natural progression of Christian growth and is the power of Redemption.  You have to forgive to be forgiven.

Last of all, the love she shared with the working-class cute guy (who really loved and needed her) is realistic in the same sense of Christianity being realistic.  Think about it???  So many still find Jesus and His way ridiculous.  The love that Christ has for His people is sooooo unreal!  But people . . . it is real.  I'm still amazed that God could love the world and me so much, as to save us from damnation.  What did we do to deserve all this?  Hmmm.  Maybe, sometimes, good things just happen to people.  Just like the scorned wife in this story.  She hit bottom, but prevailed in the end.

This is such a feel good love story.  The scorned wife stood by her evil but redeemable husband.  She was fortunate to comprehend the love the cute guy held for her.  She made closure with her husband and was free to live and love the man that really wanted her, for herself.  They both deserved that love.  And the evil husband (now born again?) was able to understand his errors and forgive too.

Now, eat your hearts out all you that can't comprehend this kind of love and NEVER will deserve it.  God Bless you all!",1127520000,8,4206,4.625169147496617

Why would Orlando keep going after Helen, when she kept treating him like crap!  I guess he likes women that look like gorillas.  This movie ended up being more of a drama than a comedy.  Also why would Orlando take Helen back after she ran out on him?  He just proposed to her, she sees on TV that her husband got shot, and she runs to the hospital to him.  Doesn't see Orlando for three weeks, all of a sudden decides she wants to be back with him, and he takes her back.

It is refreshing that such a strong Christian can get his message across the way he has been doing for about a decade now.  The film is the most spiritual commecially made film we have ever seen outside of some of those made by groups like the Billy Graham Association.  The acting and music is superb.

2270451,3,B00097DXFS,"Like most men, I'm not turned on at all by melodramatic soap-operaish type stories with instant redemption at the end. Pretty much what you'd expect, though I was surprised that Perry's Medea was so foul mouthed and gangsterish, weed-smoking and gun-toting (as this is supposed to be a ""religious"" movie).

However, I'm not as hard-nosed as I used to be about such things. It's comedy, and comedy is about humorous exaggeration of reality, which much of this is. We all know women who are prototypes of such a character.

I think the film DOES however, speak to its intended audience, which is Christian-oriented African-American women. Many women can relate to the story about the ""trifling"" man, fiding love in unlikely places, and spiritual redemption at the end, etc. Most of us guys(myself included) are too cynical for this kind of stuff, but I respect the fact that it may be theraputic for its intended audience.",1122768000,2,920,4.929032258064516

2270455,4,B00097DXFS,"If u appreciate comedy, then you'll definitely get some healthy laughs from this one. Basically all the jokes came from the dynamic senior citizen duo Madea and Brian (both played by Tyler Perry). That scene with Brian playing cards (and smoking with his folks) was quite funny :).

Apart from that, all other actors played out a serious (if not controversial) storyline about overcoming failed marriages and family crisis. Helen (Kimberly Elise) was simply amazing throughout the movie. It was tough seeing Helen deal with her villianous husband Charles (Steve Harris). But seeing her file for divorce (after finally saving and winning back his heart) to marry another (Orlando played by Shemar Moore) with christian values, was even tougher. Is this what marriage has come to?

Despite the stereotyping and Christian principles utilized carelessly throughout the script, I found ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" to be one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Just forget all your burdens u had today, get some food, sit back, and relax before watching this. You will be entertained.",1122336000,,1086,5.06145251396648
2270456,3,B00097DXFS,"The Dairy of a Mad Black Woman is an excellent movie and in my opinion Tyler Perry could not have made a more timely movie then this.  Black women today are constantly faced with the decision to be alone or settle for a man who can only give them a part of their hearts desire in a man.  It was refreshing to view a movie that addressed the pain, confusion and disappointment felt by black women when we are betrayed by a man whom we have given our whole hearts to.  What Mr. Perry did with Dairy, is to remind us that there are still some good quality black men around and that when given the opportunity, most black women today will walk away from money and the ""American Dream"" for a man who is strong, sensitive, compassionate and sure of himself and who will be understanding and patient with us when we are going through the painful seasons in our lives.  I commend Tyler Perry on this movie and his plays, which lets us see ourselves as we are in hopes of encouraging and motivating us as a people to continue to strive to fix thoses things that are contributing to the destruction of the African American family.

2270458,5,B00097DXFS,"Diary of a Mad Black Woman is one of the best movies of 2005. Director Darren Grant does a wonderful job of adapting Tyler Perry's popular stage play to the screen. Don't listen to the ""professional"" movie critics; this film is worth seeing at least three or four times.

Diary is the story of Helen, a woman faithfully married to her husband Charles for 18 years. Dumped on her anniversary she's forced to return home to the family she abandoned. Moving in with her Grandmother Madea she begins her journey towards starting her life over. I'd love to get into the story but I love this movie so much I don't want to give anymore away, this movie is just TOO GOOD TO SPOIL for those who haven't seen it.

Kimberly Elise gives an incredible performance as Helen. I felt every emotion Helen had and was involved in her characters' story Watch out Halle, Angela, Gabrielle and Viveca, Kimberly Elise is an up and comer. In a couple of years she's going to be the next black female superstar.  Shemar Moore takes his acting to another level as Orlando. He shows us how much potential he truly has when given a quality script to work with. Tamara Taylor steals the scenes she's in as the drug addicted wife. I wish she had more screen time. Cicely Tyson is great as the Helen's mother. Tyler Perry does a tremendous job in his memorable three roles. Joe and Madea will have you cracking up with their one-liners!

Director Darren Grant does a wonderful job with the limited resources he has. With only $5 million dollars he makes a film that looks like it cost $100 million. The beautiful cinematography makes the city of Atlanta itself a character. I felt like I was right there in some of those locations. Looking at the extra features section on the making of, Diary of a Mad Black Woman I was surprised to find out there are special effects in this film. All the frames where Tyler Perry plays different characters blend so seamlessly all you see are the characters in the story.

A Shawn James Essential Five star video. Please, Please pick this one up for your collection. In fact pick one up to give to friends and family as a gift you will not be disappointed and they won't be disappointed.",1121644800,3,2194,4.516372795969773
2270459,5,B00097DXFS,"'Diary of a Mad Black Woman' may be the best African-American film since 'Waiting to Exhale'. You will love the script that is very well written by Tyler Perry.

You have this woman (Helen) who is abused physically and mentally by a Black Attorney of the Year in Atlanta. He is rich. You will love the mansion. What a mansion! Helen is kicked out for a white woman who he is secretly courting with his kids. In the process, the Uhaul driver is Shemar Moore's character who also works at a steel mill.

Ironically, Helen is very forgiving and lets him have his way in the divorce proceedings. But she really has not moved on. Shemar Moore loves her, woos her, and proposes to her. He like her has been left by another person in a marriage (a NFL football star). You will like how she finds out she is engaged. I can't spoil it, so you must watch and find out: Very unconventional but sweet.

And then the un-expected happens to the Attorney character. His demons catches up with him in the form of an old Afro-American male friend. And the Attorney is left in a coma.

Christine, his new love of his life, wants him to be allowed to die for obvious reasons. But Helen comes to the hospital as the wife to fight for his life, after being interrupted in the midst of a proposal by a news report of the attorney on tv. This leaves the proposal in limbo because she decides to be a good christian and help his get back on his feet. And comes a lot of anger and it is psycho-tic like, scary, but he asked for it from Helen.

In the midst, he changes his life 360 degrees and see who his real friends are and who really loves him, beyond just the marriage/affair situation. He gives his life to Christ. Repents for all the things he has done. Helen repents also for her mini-rage. So at the end you cannot really tell who Helen will marry. Trust me, unless someone has already told you the ending, you will not know who she will be with. And so I leave you with this clift hanger to watch the film!",1121644800,4,1991,4.256613756613756
2270460,5,B00097DXFS,"I didn't know what to expect by seeing this i remember seeing  Madea's family reunion a couple of years back and laughing alot but i wasn't sure if the success of the plays could transfer into film. But it's safe to say that it did and this movie was a very enjoyable film to watch and it's one of those movies you come out a little bit wiser from watching.

The Plot of ""Diary of a mad black women"" is Helen(kimberly elise) is literally thrown out her house by her egotistical husband Charles(steve harris)
because they have been married 18 years and he's sick of her and plus he has 2 kids with a estranged women. And now Helen who is homeless and no choice but to go to her grandmothers house who's name is Madea(Tyler Perry) and now she tries to pick up the pieces of her life and try to handle her problems in a christian way but it turns out that helen is a very mad black women who is very close to the edge.

Then While suffering her eviction from her house and her husband being a total jerk she meets a man that she finds very attractive and she starts to fall for him. But while this is happening her big shot lawyer husband is defending a corrupt man and if he doesnt get this corrupt man off from his charges, well let's just say it's not going to be good for him. As for Madea she is a gangsta grandma who smokes and keeps a handgun in her purse and she makes this movie a very pleasant experience.

This Movie has So many twists and so many stories from within helen's family(you also follow her brothers story as his wife is a recovering drug addict)that when the movie is finished you will feel so emotionally exhausted. At times the acting in this movie can be a bit dramatic and some parts may be a bit cliche' or tired by movie terms these days but it does not mess up this movie. I highly suggest that you atleast rent this movie to see if you like it and then purchase if you do.

Just come into this movie very clear-minded because this movie is a emotional rollercoaster.
But do not forget that its still part comedy so you will get a few good laughs in.
Overall i give 4.5 stars so i will round it up to 5!
Go now! Rent!

I have had an affinity for Kimberly Elise's acting since ""Set It Off"", and Tyler Perry playing three different roles is a tribute to his genius.  It was great to see Steve Harris in a role other than ""Eugene"" on ""The Practice"".  Cicely Tyson chose a great movie to play a supporting role in.

It was a bit hard to see Shemar Moore in a blue-collar, rugged position compared to his pretty-rich-boy character on daytime soap operas, but the message was still the same.

You have to give your situation to God and let Him handle it... if you've found true love, go after it, and if nothing else, don't give up on the ones you love. Even when it hurts like everything!

Tyler Perry combines comedy, drama, love, and an inspirational message to make a very well rounded film.  The acting is solid and it is both funny and uplifting.

The biggest flaw with DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN is the fact that you can tell that it was a play that was made into a film.  Is that a big deal? No. It becomes a non-factor because you are enthralled by the growth that is made by the near real-life characters in this production: A hateful, mean-spirited husband treats his wife of 18 years like dirt  eventually kicking her out and moving in his girlfriend and his children;  That same man nearly dies and through his illness he finds the Lord and becomes a kind, good man; A drug addict mother goes from being an addict living on the streets away from her family to going to rehab and re-entering the church and reuniting with her family; And, an angry black women forgives the man that stole her life away from her for 18 years and finds true love.  You can't help but to dig this story about ordinary people and their struggles and how they resolve their struggles.  This is a very well put together film.

2270465,5,B00097DXFS,"I rented this because I thought the previews looked somewhat funny.  I have never seen the character Medea and feared the movie may be the stereotypical hip-hop overly 'street-hangin' movie, which I do not enjoy at all.

This movie far exceeded my expectations.  The acting was good - sometimes a bit campy (what I mean is there were big switches from emotional parts to out and out fun comedy) but that really added to the charm in the Medea scenes - which I enjoyed immensely.  I laughed out loud, I cried and I think I even clapped.  Some of it was predictable, some not - and all of it was good.  I really enjoyed the talented actors.  And man, what a beautiful couple Kim and Shamar made (and the character Orlando - oh gosh, made you believe in fairy tales)!

The movie portrayed class and decency - unfortunately sometimes lacking in movies that have predominately African American casts.  The scenes were beautiful and the music was very classy - I will be getting the soundtrack. (Very impressed with 'Chandra').

Even we southern white women know grandmas and aunts like Medea - she is universal and appealingly so. I just wish I could go to her house for Sunday dinner!

I get tired of consumer reviews that try to be pseudo professional critics - I am not a reviewer at a play, I want to ENJOY a film and at best, take something away - 'Diary of a Mad Black Woman' delivers.  I don't care if Medea isn't morally perfect (are real people?) or on the other side of the coin if the movie is 'inspirational' (frankly that was part of its grandness).  What a bland world some of us must want to live in.  I will gladly enjoy Medea's charm and rejoice in the inspiration of the movie. This is a movie that your older kids could watch.  No bad cursing, no sex scenes.

I do agree with some other reveiwers that there are a few things that did not need to be in the movie - like the weed smoking scene, or the porn magazine, or really that guy's entire character.

But the positive's more than make up for it.  I don't really understand why all the reviewers keep saying that the Christians in this movie are being hypocritical - Madea and the old guy, Tom, I think, are not Christians, and never claim to be.  And the others, they are Christians, but they never claim to be perfect, and no Christian SHOULD claim that, because it's a lie.  I didn't get the vibe that they were ""holier than thou"" or that they thought they were better than other people because they were Christians.

 And what I mean by that if you notice the male race is heavily exploited in most of Tyler Perry's films (Don't get me wrong he is a genius of a playwrite) but here and there (after the male gender has been beat down) do they show a scene where a real man has the the chance to defend himself and sure the audience may clap or cheer a little but it is no retrobution for the bashing that the male gender has to take, and I know that there is yet another female that is going to read this and say "" Well you don't know what we go through "" or "" That was wrong what he did to her "" but no one (no female that is) saw the man who the man who had the crackhead wife who was raising two children on his own,Well guess what you don't know what we go through either!!  and also woman do wrong things too, So stop assuming, it can hurt both people.

 I agree with the person speaks on how Christian have been demoralized and if I had not been with my child who asked me to take her to see this waste of time and money then I would left the theater before half the the movie was over and the reason being is because even though Tyler Perry is as a very good writer he exploited his own ignorance along with everyone elses when he said in the movie "" Kunta Kinte put his foot down and he got it chopped off"" how stupid can you get (and people were in stitches when they heard that) this was a man who tried to run for his freedom and if it weren't for people like him then we would all still be slaves and would you be laughing then while the white man still does to us what he pleases? Yeah I know you wouldnt, and all you female soap opera/ drama lovers would all of you have seen or purchased the movie if it was called ""Diary of a mad black Man""? Yeah I didn't think so!!

 This movie is absolutly horrible but is is in fact good marketing on Mr Perrys part, as a matter of fact his plays should have the same name I would call the plays ""Selling the Drama Vol. 1-5 Get it:)",1120521600,14,2113,3.9344262295081966

2270471,2,B00097DXFS,"Tyler Perry, an above average playwright, found his niche in black theatrical plays. Cashing in the millions from predominately black audiences. Diary is Perry's first jump from the stage to the big-screen. I'll try to keep my review as realistic and honest as possible here.

The Positives.

1. Diary as well as the rest of Perry's plays has always preached the positives of having strength in family, community, and in self.

2. All of the ultimate messages displayed are great morals all grafted or inspired from the Holy Bible. The film is loaded with plenty of biblical/Christian undertones.

3. Shemar Moore refrains from taking off his shirt for once.

The Negatives.

Despite the positive qualities of this film. The negatives send this one spiraling down like an albatross. This film is overloaded with countless and redundant stereotypes that plague many of today's ""black"" films and television shows. At times I felt like I was watching an old Minstrel Show minus the blackface paint. The comedy unveiled in Diary is extremely poor and one dimensional. For Media to be the inspirational/spiritual grandmother, she contradicts her elegance by overly pulling out hand guns on relatives, friends, and innocent bystanders. Don't get me wrong, I chuckled at the gun scenes...but it wasn't that funny. It's just sad when you have to get a roar out of your audience by adding on gun play to a bland/unoriginal joke. The scenes with her brother smoking weed with the other relatives could have been left out as well. For this to be a Christian oriented film, the protagonists often contradict themselves and their ""holiness"". None of the actors and actresses convinced me. Kimberley Elise was gaining a lot of momentum as an upcoming black actress on the scene, and kills that momentum here. She simply doesn't add flavor to this bad exploitation movie. At times Diary makes you feel like your watching a cheesy soap opera on UPN. It saddens me that many of our people (yes I'm a brotha) buy into this mess in the 21st century. It's like these Madia plays are sending us back 30 years. You can respond with the oh so common ""it's just a film lighten up"" stuff. But how much longer are we going to keep tolerating this nonsense. Diary is supposed to be uplifting but it brings us right back down time after time. The acting was horrific. Note, if Shamar Moore is casted in a film, chances are you're watching a bad movie.

It seems as if a majority of our (black/African-American) films are illustrated on these unrealistic canvases. Always a struggle between the filthy rich and the filthy poor in unrealistic settings. And in the midst of these films the people in the middle are never highlighted. ""Black"" films need more avant-garde substance in today's cinema. The clich' black church ending pretty much did it for me, which was stolen right from the Color Purple. Remember when Shug Avery marched to the church and tore the house down with her daughter leading the choir??? Well you're about to see it again, but with a terrible lipsynching voice over. When Elise takes Madia's advice to forgive,,, she does and nurses her paraplegic low-down husband back to full strength...to where he admits his wrongs and he is ultimately saved. She dumps him at the family Sunday dinner table (Wow, you picked the right time and place to do this!!!) for Shemar Moore because she's in love! I'm sorry but this is just unbelievable. Oh yeah the final sequence rips off An Officer and a Gentleman. You're a genius Tyler!

Ultimately, I think in time... Perry's scripts, humor, intelligence, and originality will come into fruition. Perry's is an amazing entrepreneur who restored some life to the art of being a black thespian on stage. It's just unfortunate that he's always dumbing down and exploiting our culture and audience with these mama plays, while hiding the sheer ignorance of the material with a Christian cloak. The Christian cloak keeps the negative critics at bay (kind of like how we can't boo the terrible singer at the Apollo, who chooses to sing a gospel hymn). The whole Christian superiority complex exists way too much in this film also.

Perry should have taken notes from Robert Townsend, Spike Lee, and F Gary Gray to carry a much swifter point across.",1120521600,9,4270,4.854395604395604
2270472,5,B00097DXFS,"In this fabulous film, heroine Helen is physically thrown out of the house by her philandering, abusive husband.  Crying in a UHaul filled with her things, being driven by the delectable Orlando (Shemar Moore), she finds herself at the home of her grandmother Medea, who takes her in.  But Medea doesn't take kindly to her granddaughter's plight at the hands of her husband...and thinks that a little attitude adjusment may be in order......

This is a film that has something for everyone.  Medea and the other characters that Tyler Perry portrays bring that great comedic element; there's certainly drama in the love triangle created by Helen's lawyer husband, and in the touching struggle of a father whose love for his wife is overshadowed by her addiction to drugs; and then there is the birth of a great love...between Helen and Orlando.  Add to all of this a foot-tapping soundtrack, and what you have is a true recipe for success.  This movie cannot be missed.

2270477,4,B00097DXFS,"Recently, I saw Kimberly Elise' Woman Thou Art Loose, and I was so taken by her performance. Diary of a Mad Black Woman is the perfect star showcase vehicle for Elise to demonstrate her dramatic range with a performance that requires her to shed a bucket of tears, get mad and get even with her nasty husband, forgive and let go, and fall in love again. This film instantly reminded me of Angela Bassette's Waiting To Exhale, but it's funnier, because Tyler Perry was totally funny. His portrayal of Madea is the comic relief to this touching dramedy.

Kimberly Elise(Helen), a loving housewife gets humiliated and kicked out by her self-center and successful lawyer husband(Charles/Steve Harris) whom she had been married to for 18 years. He had been secretly having a relationship with a white woman who had two kids with him. Helen had been mistreated by him a great deal, and she even had two miscarriages. She was devastated and had to go and stay with her tough and fierce grandmother Madea(Tyler Perry). Madea took her back to her husband's mansion and did some serious damage to the place, and they got arrested.

Orlando(Shemar Moore), a friend of Brian(Tyler Perry), who is Helen's cousin eventually become romantically involved with her. He had been on a rebound from a bad breakup and instantly related to the pain she was going through, and they bonded intimately. She was so happy for the first time that she was gradually falling in love again. All of a sudden, Charles gets shot by his vengeful client in the courtroom, and he was bed ridden for days. His money greedy mistress took all his money and abandoned him, leaving him in the care of Helen. She came back to get even with him, and she tortured him for days before forgiving him. He then realized that he must change and redemn himself.

Tyler Perry also played Grand Daddy Joe, the least striking role out of the three that he played. Tamara Taylor gave a scene-stealing performance as Brian's drug addict wife on the road to recovery. The sexy hunk Shemar Moore had some touching and romantic moments with Elise, and he's come a long way since The Young and The Rest. The gospel singing scene was very spiritually empowering. This film really delivered the message of only through the power of God can help you forgive sometimes.",1120003200,4,2305,4.7288557213930345

2270479,5,B00097DXFS,"I saw the play and the movie - and I enjoyed both - regardless of the reviews, I admire Tyler Perry for stepping out and doing it himself without the help of Hollywood.  He put his own money in the movie and the production, thank you Loin Gate Films for trusting him and getting it out to us - he filmed it at his house - all 16,000 sq.ft., in Atlanta.  He had great stars in it - and he went back to his play ""Madea's Class Reunion"" and picked from his cast some great singers, put them in the movie too.  This shows that he appreciated their hard work in his plays and their faithfulness.  With God guilding him through this process - Tyler's territory was enlarged greatly, the real people loved it came out on February 25th - that weekend and made it the #1 movie at $22.7 million.  I think coming from sleeping in his car (homelessness) to $22.7 million in 7 years is not a bad thing, regardless what the reviews say - they don't know everything and they don't know what people will spend their money to go see.  Tyler Perry has got my vote - I will go and spend my money on every movie he makes and every play he creates and I will buy all of them the right way - not bootleg.

2270480,4,B00097DXFS,"When Helen's husband of 18 years decides he doesn't need her anymore, Helen must overcome not only her anger and rage but must learn what it is to truly love.  From this beginning, Diary of a Mad Black Woman goes on a wild tale that goes through many different sub genres of comedy.  There's some slapstick, low brow comedy, witty dialogue and even a touch of dark comedy toward the end.

Writer Tyler Perry creates a terrific vehicle to play three roles by himself.  By far the best role in here for him is Madea, Helen's semi-crazy aunt (I think?).  Madea's parts are the funniest portions of the movie, using everything from her gun to a chainsaw to prove a point.  Her over the top behaviour is perfect in setting the tone of the movie.  And considering Madea is a big character in Tyler's plays, I have a feeling we'll be seeing more of her.

Sometimes, though, Tyler's roles have an Eddie Murphy Klumps feel to them, especially Joe, an elderly man who is still infatuated with younger women.  His suggestions that he has viagra etc are directly in line with the Klumps style humor.  I wish he would have not created a character similar to those in that movie so he could stand on his own.  But, overall, it was all very funny.

Toward the end, the movie started reaching for cliches and melodrama.  The final scene in the church is a bit over the top for me.  That said, it's a great date movie.  There's enough laughs and tears for everyone that those who want to just laugh will laugh and those that like to cry at the end of a happy/sappy movie will also enjoy it.

I don't normally enjoy romantic films, I'm the first to admit it.  The genre has been filled with too many cliches and over the top moments that I can't usually get into them.  And yet I enjoyed this film for the most part.  With some of the exceptions above (especially the final church scene), I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Sure, sometimes it gets a little heavy handed and cliched but it still is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a long while.",1120003200,4,2041,4.392
2270481,1,B00097DXFS,"So, now we have a new way to proselytize, peddling the blood of the Master like a used Edsel, trying yet again to merchandise the gospel to the unsupsecting fools who paid for this tripe expecting entertainment but getting indoctrination instead!

Look, I have no problem with Christianity, but if the product is purely a propaganda tool for that particular religious point of view, it would be nice if they indicated that on the packaging. Nowhere does it mention this is a film with a direct message intended to proselytize. If it had, I would have saved my money. I feel cheated and robbed. My money has been usurped from my wallet and under false pretense as well.

If I want a religious oriented film, I would buy religious oriented films. If they sell religious oriented films, it should be made clear they are religious oriented films. They aren't making that point clear because the intent is to snooker you into watching the damn thing so as to endure the message! It should be noted that I bought ""The Passion of the Christ"" and knew fully what it was before I bought it. I bought it on purpose. I bought it knowing the subject matter. It was my free will decision to buy it with full knowledge that it was religious in nature.

What I object to is the sneaky, underhanded approach used to market this film. It does not convey that it is a religious film, sneaks the DVD into your living room under the guise of entertainment, then unfolds as a gospel message covertly packaged to conceal that fact from the buyer.

One thing this film makes abundantly clear, the right religion (in the view of the film) is that Jesus is Lord. What a treat for Jews, Muslims, Hindus or folks of other religions. The message seems to be that their religion is the right one, and somebody else's is not.

Who comes seeking to kill, steal and destroy? My money was stolen when I spent it on this malarky, which stumps for a religion that has been responsible for more wars than any other cause, more death and destruction that any other mechanism, in all of human experience.

And I am damn mad about it.

How can I redeeem my money?

It was purloined, so far as I am concerned.

I give this film one star, not because the acting isn't great, or the various performers lacking talent. I give it one star because it uses underhanded and sneaky technique to get the DVD into homes of unsuspecting folks (like me) who really do not appreciate having the free will aspect of the buying decision undermined in order to slip propaganda into my hands.

Mel Gibson was up-front and direct with his film, these people were covert and sneaky in their attempt to proselytize and market the blood of Christ. They will make their money, like the money changers in the temple. I would think Jesus would be just about as happy about it as he was with those of whom he said ""you have made my father's house a den of theives!""",1119916800,12,2900,4.485768500948766

Yet, God created man and took woman from his side that she should be with him all his days. What about this world's wealth? It perishes, right? Those who trust in wealth, will they not perish with it? Why then throw your wife out like trash for the sake of this wealth? Answer: we are deceived. We are without knowledge. It is written ""My people perish for lack of knowledge"". But the course of God's jugement on Charles results in him making a right decision in the end.

2270494,2,B00097DXFS,"Adapted from a Tyler Perry stage play, ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" is the story of Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise), a polished, pampered, too-naive-to-be-true wife that has been forced onto the road of self-discovery and spiritual awareness, after being thrown out of her home by her husband of 18 years, Charles (Steve Harris), a highly successful, ironfisted defense attorney, in order to make room for Charles' mistress/mother of his illegitimate children (Lisa Marcos). While on her journey, she receives a little help from her mother (Cicely Tyson) and not-so-polished family from the 'hood, headed up by her lewd, crude, pistol-packing grandmother, Madea (Perry in drag).

The impact of Helen's plight would have been just as strong with less than half of the melodrama-turned-wackiness that you're subjected to in the first 20 minutes of the film. Admittedly, Steve Harris is rather convincing as a rat bastard, but that's precisely the problem, because we never learn just *what* it is that Charles is so mad about, which makes his WAY over-the-top enmity towards his lovely, docile, submissive wife of 18 years, cartoonish. Charles' behavior towards Helen wouldn't be totally unbelievable without reason, and Perry has a golden opportunity to give the characters some depth and the film some body by setting the stage for Helen and Charles' breakup, but he squanders this opporunity in lieu of clearing a platform for the Antichrist that has taken on the form of a Black male.

As fate would have it, Helen and her clothes end up being carted away from her Atlanta mansion and shambles of a marriage by Orlando (Shemar Moore).  Orlando is a divorced factory worker (his wife left him for a professional athlete because he didn't make enough money) whose Christian, handsome (in a rough-around-the-edges kind of way), chiseled, kind-spirited, charming, sensitive, sympathetic, patient, understanding, forgiving, affectionate, celibate, and immovable, where winning Helen over is concerned.  The only things he's missing are wings and a halo.

Helen's a Christian woman who feels compelled to remain committed to her marriage, after extenuating circumstances render her husband paralyzed, helpless, and alone. (The twist is that vengeance creeps in and eventually becomes every bit as much a motivator for Helen as her religious convictions.)  This causes Orlando to flinch, but only because Helen completely disappears from his life without explanation, and then refuses to make a decisive choice about her future with him upon reappearing.

There are a couple of subplots regarding Charles' dark background and a cousin, Brian (played by Perry out of drag), a responsible father dealing with an estranged wife struggling with a drug addiction, that I'm guessing were thrown in to add 'balance' to the film, but they're not very well thought out and as a result, rather uninspiring.  The final scene of the movie is a blatant rip-off of the final scene in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"".  The film has it's funny moments (and I do mean moments), but overall... inflammatory, hypocritical, sappy, a smorgasboard of stereotypes, and the comedy is predictable, regardless of whether you're familiar with Perry's previous workings or not.

I will give Tyler Perry credit for this much...he knows precisely where his bread is buttered.  For those who may not be at all familiar with his work, Perry is a highly successful, wildly popular playwright with an inspiring rags-to-riches story of his own to tell and, to his credit, a list of ""Comedy/Drama/Gospel"" hybrid stage plays that have grossed probably hundreds of millions of dollars by now and are attractive to a devoted following of predominantly church-going Blacks in America, the majority of them women.  Hence all of the eyes-wide-shut heaps of praise for this *clearly* bad movie that couldn't get a dime to eat if it wasn't of Black people, by Black people and for Black people.

This isn't by any stretch of imagination a masterful piece of cinema, and (dare I say it) it isn't intended to be. It's merely something to get Perry's feet wet in the big screen arena, and to keep the flock hyped until the collection plate makes it around to their pew.  And it's intended to be precisely what it tells you it is...a battering ram ""for every Black woman that was ever done wrong by a Black man""... nothing more, nothing less.  So if you're not willing to shift your brain into neutral, or you're not a Black woman (mad or otherwise) and you're not a Tyler Perry fan.....then I suggest that you skip this one.  If you're looking for something truly ""inspirational"" and you don't already have them in your collection, I'd recommend ""Antwone Fisher"" and ""Coach Carter"".",1114041600,5,4727,5.095730918499354

You must see this movie.  I cried, I laughed, I laughed until I cried.  I remember Mr. Perry's coverstory in Ebony magazine in mid-Summer or early Fall.  They took pictures of his home.  He used his the entrance to his home, bedroom, and I guess great room, and study/home office in the movie.
