7826402,4,6302374065,"The filmmaking maestro of dark dreams created one on stage with this mesmerizing musical meditation on the layers of broken heartedness. Those who enjoy David Lynch's intuitive-level imagery will see much of it here, as an abstract theatre piece featuring a floating singer, plastic dolls and model planes suspended from above, an elk-man on stilts, a dwarf sawing a piece of log, a near naked woman slinking in and out of an antique car, and lots of smoke and pulsating amber light in a jarring industrial environment. Not a piece for the impatient or short attention span, this 40-min dream washes over the viewer like a leisurely, surreal stream of lush melody, soothing (almost non-expressive) vocals, and ebbs away like a dream into waking life.

Long out of print (and previously available only on VHS), Industrial Symphony #1 is finally, as of 2008, available on DVD as part of Lynch's massive 10-disc Lime Green Set, which includes many other re-released early films -- a decent investment if you don't already have most of them. The singer, Julee Cruise, released these songs on a CD; one could consider Industrial Symphony #1 the music video album version, with Lynch's vision the perfect complement to the recordings.",1151625600,5,1228,5.019607843137255

For the 1989 festival, the Academy approached David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti to perform two 45 minute shows on November 10, 1989.  They only had two weeks to prepare for the show, leaving little time to come up with an idea and rehearse.  Taking the title from a collection of his works produced while he was at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Lynch and Badalamenti worked Julee Cruise's music together with various imagery to produce a unique concert performance.  To open the piece, Lynch shot a new film sequence of a phone conversation between a guy and girl breaking up, featuring Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern with whom he was currently shooting Wild At Heart.  As with any live performance, there were a few problems.  The digital tape used for the soundtrack stopped during rehearsal and had to be quickly replaced.  During the first performance, the man in the deer on stilts costume started to fall over into the orchestra pit.  Lynch recalled, ""It was my first live thing and I learned that many things go wrong and many, many, many more things almost go wrong.""  Problems aside, the show made it through it's two performances, and the video proved to be a fairly good seller.  The 10 pieces featured are:

1. Up In Flames

2. I Float Alone

3. The Black Sea

4. Into The Night

5. I'm Hurt Bad

6. Pinky's Bubble Egg (The Twins Spoke)

7. The Dream Conversation

8. Rockin' Back Inside My Heart

9. The Final Battle

10. The World Spins",1094947200,11,1563,4.614545454545454
