8090790,2,B000BPZ7O8,"This could have been really beautiful. From a technical viewpoint, however, it is extremely disapointing. First, it is only 16 minutes long. Next, the transitions are quick and jerky. If the idea is to relax, at the very least the transitions should be smooth fades. A poorly executed product!",1182038400,,293,5.0
8090791,3,B000BPZ7O8,"It has nice pictures and is very relaxing. A short part at the beginning you hear bird sounds, but most of it is harp music which I found disappointing. The music over powers the words and I expected to hear bird sounds through the DVD.",1176076800,,236,4.266666666666667

Michelle & 1st Lt. Clay Bringhurst, USMC

""I bought one and 25 of us sat and watched it, we bought 4 more and gave them as gifts, one to my sister-in-law whose husband is fighting cancer and she makes everyone who comes thru her door sit down and watch it, everyone loves it""

Ann

""Your DVD is excellent! I Loved it!""

Kathi Ackerman, Executive Director, MN DARE, Inc.

""We have just spent our nicest lunch break in ages, watching and relaxing - this should be compulsory to every soul in business!""

Krystyna & Paul

""My two boys, Daniel 4 and James 2, sat and asked lots of questions about the birds, they really liked it - you are so lucky to live in a place with so many lovely things around you""

Linda & family

""Truly Spectacular! I felt like I was sitting out in nature and the birds were coming to me - my wife has Parkinson's and the nature and wildlife scenes were very soothing and comforting to her, your words of inspiration and footage are excellent""
