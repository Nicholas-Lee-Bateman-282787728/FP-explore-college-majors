3909851,4,B002D755BC,"My 2-year-old LOVES Barney. This is one of the higher quality Barney videos (some of the videos are a bunch of ""flashback"" scenes from other episodes edited together). I bought this video in early October, and by the time Halloween came, my two-year-old was a trick-or-treating machine! She went out on a mission and took the bad with the good. She was used to watching Baby Bop and BJ talk about saftey while trick-or-treating and she saw that the trick-or-treating experience is not always perfect. It seemed to give her a lot more patience. I think watching all of the costumes on the show also helped her to no be so shocked when she would come across some of the scarier costumes on Halloween. She was still a little scared, but she realized that everyone was just in a costume and that the ""monsters"" were not real. This is worth buying. ***Parent Annoyance Meter Rating: 2*** (1= not annoying whatsoever, I would watch this without my child ; 5=If I have to watch this again, someone better bring me a straitjacket)",1258243200,9,1022,4.651933701657459
