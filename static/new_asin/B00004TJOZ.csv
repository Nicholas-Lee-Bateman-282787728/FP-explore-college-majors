Are you sensing my awe and ecstatic glee of all things Oprah here, people? You should be! Whatever she touches is instant gold and this tape is no different! If this is sold out don't wait -- go and get it from your closest video retailer. If someone in front of you in line has the last copy gouge out their eyes with your thumbs and take theirs -- they won't need it anylonger and you will be happy that you did!",996192000,2,614,4.168067226890757
8072444,4,B00004TJOZ,"This video shows the real day-to-day responsibilities of taking care of a newborn.  The title, ""Begin With Love"", promotes beginning and ending with loving your baby. The parents are real, showing their real  feelings and nervous anticipation of in-the-moment challenges.  I think all  newborn parents can easily relate with these parents. It would have been  nice to see added clips of parents who had been through the ordeal offering  their real-life solutions.  Although I think 30 minutes is too short to  give all the solutions to infant care-taking, it definitely offers great  advice to new parents.  The narration is great at explaining what the  nervous parents can't articulate.  The advice of the doctors threaded  in-between the scenes of the nurture-challenged parents adds excellent  solutions on caring for newborns. And the adorable faces of these babies  tugged at my heart in watching them endure their first weeks adapting to  this world. A great visual insight to what our lives are all about!",958262400,8,1013,5.198757763975156
