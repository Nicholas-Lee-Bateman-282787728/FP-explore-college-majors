2466406,5,B000CNESJE,"""Keep Your Distance"" rocks. It is an excellent movie. It is a must see. It has all of the elements of sex, trust, betrayal, and mystery. Gil Bellows did a great job playing his character. Jennifer Westfeldt was marvelous. Kim Raver was magnificent. She had her lines down to a science. Stacy Keach, Elizabeth Pena, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job. I love the movie. I've been watching it over and over again. It has not left my DVD player.

I love the extra stuff on the DVD, too. They were great.

Stu Pollard rocks..................",1142121600,4,548,4.525252525252525
2466407,4,B000CNESJE,"Even though this has a made for tv look about it it's a very fine effort. Filled with twists and turns keep your distance win leave you satisfied with the time spent viewing. it has elements of sex,actual violence,betrayal,mistrust and realtionship troubles which leaves the players in the movie going aweful lengths in order to get their inter and intra personal selves in order.

I recommend this.",1142121600,11,399,4.955223880597015
2466408,5,B000CNESJE,"This is a rare treat. The cast did an amazing job. It's

I will watch the DVD many times in the future....way to go

2466409,1,B000CNESJE,"Gil Bellows (Tv's Ally McBeal, The Weather Man), miscast big time stars as Radio man David Dailey who's life takes some sharp turns...be it his wife Susan Dailey, played by Kim Raver (Tv's 24, and Third Watch) or this stranger who keeps ending these notes with one word on them to him. Jennifer Westfeldt (Kissing Jessica Stein, See Jane Run) plays Melody Carpenter who becomes good friends with David Dailey. She also has to put up with Sean Voight, played by a wasted Christian Kane (whos better in the Tv show ""Angel"" then this) who stalks her constantly and does stupid things to win her trust and stuff like that. Kane also plays his own music...because, well Kane is a musician and he has his own country band named ""Kane"" so...anyway. Stacy Keach (Titus, Escape from L.A.) is even wasted as well played Kane's dad Brooks Voight. Not much on the writing...pretty much a big bust here. Also starring Elizabeth Pena (Rush Hour, Across the Moon), Gary Anthony Williams (Malcolm in the Middle, The Boondocks) and Jamie Harrold (The Score, Sum of all Fears). Nothing thrilling or exciting about this....although Westeldt has a nice behind and all those jeans look good on her...I know but its true.",1141603200,6,1199,4.797101449275362
2466410,4,B000CNESJE,"Keep Your Distance was an engrossing movie dealing with a multitude of relationships.  There is the marriage of two people with very little in common.  A serious relationship between two good looking people who seem to have it all; good looks, a creative and interesting relationship, yet lack the key ingredient: trust.  Between these two relationships come some other minor connection between a notable politician, one of his main supporters, and a fellow employee.
 Sound confusing? Well, in the beginning it is just a little, but more so it is incredibly enthralling.  Our introduction to the two main characters places them in a situation that portrays them in a less than likable light, but in no time it is revealed who they really are and we can't help but root for them for the remainder of the flick.
 Through their endeavors we see David Dailey (Gil Bellows) a notable radio talk show host and Melody (Jennifer Westfeldt), a traveling saleswoman for the pharmacy industry, strike up a friendship in which they help each other through difficult times.  The attraction they have to each other is evident but is not fully explored because they are each too busy dealing with their own failing relationships to dive into something new.
 There are many funny moments to be had in the first two thirds of the film with the last third delving into some more serious situations.  Riveting from beginning to end, we see the progression of all of the relationships come full circle...and then a little more.  While the ending was a bit anti-climatic, this doesn't negate the incredible intertwining stories throughout the majority of the movie and a couple of A+ performances as well.
 The main flaw of this film is that there is so much plot that it is impossible to fit it into 90 minutes.  Another 90 minutes or so may have been sufficient but the general public probably wouldn't be to keen on a three hour movie (although I certainly would!)  Many of the important events in this are left unexplored yet the main focus, on David and Melody, is where the story begins and ends, as it should be.
 On Saturday, Oct. 29th, I had the privilege of seeing one of a very few select screenings of the movie Keep Your Distance, written and directed by Stu Pollard.  Keep Your Distance is Stu's second feature length flick, done completely independently.  The budget was between $1-2 million dollars and while this is relatively low by many standards, it doesn't show in the movie at all.  Every scene was very well polished and was complimented by a great soundtrack supplied entirely by bands from Louisville, KY (the writer/directors home town and where the entire movie was shot.)
 While the movie may not have any ""A-list"" actors, the people they got could not have fit more perfectly.  Especially Westfeldt whose attitude and unique mannerisms provide one of the most down to earth performances I have seen in a while.  Why I have not heard of her until now is beyond me.
 I highly suggest giving this film a shot.  It's independent status isn't going to get it any reviews from Roger Ebert unless it is picked up by a studio, and it likely won't be coming to a theater near you, so look for it at the video store or just do a blind buy on DVD.  The bonus features alone will be worth it to see how this film was shot for such a modest budget.  Now that I know who Stu Pollard is and know what he has to offer, I can't wait to see what he cooks up next.",1137110400,26,3454,4.606209150326797

2466553,5,B000CNESJE,"This is a great melodrama. There's suspense, action and romance. Gil Bellows plays a suave and spiritually strong role; for what in a comedy (or heavy thriller) the protagonist would act stressed-out and psychotic, he doesn't which is perfect. There are many romantic relationship that interact rather than clash. There are slight breaks in social taboos of the first person experience of the young working-class generation such as relation repair mechanism, blackmail, adultery, suicide, stalking and sexuality. Gil Bellows role is that of the rock of strength where the message is clear that tragedies and broken dreams ""are not the end of the world."" The melodrama is eased by a great musical score which glues the scenes together. This is the kind of movie to watch when you are stressed and you need something to ease you down. The ending is very climatic and full of action, but the moral will be soothing to you (great resolution and not frustrated).",1407110400,2,957,4.9875

So much media, so little time!  I know we're all unique in our tastes but I find other reviewers' input really helpful when I decide what to watch (or buy for that matter). So I like to add my two cents worth when I can.

This isn't a terrible movie; some things about it are quite pleasant. But I found it unfocused and boring.  If the endless fascination with ""he / she loves me, loves me not, etc etc."" is your thing, this might be an okay choice.  Otherwise ""keep your distance,"" ha ha.",1391990400,,672,4.2936507936507935

2466577,3,B000CNESJE,Decent Indy film. There were some things to like but not a lot to dislike. The acting was good throughout most of the cast. The script was nothing special but the relationship between the 2 leads was odd so I guess that's what got my attention.  I put the film on to watch while I was doing something else and it drew my attention to it away from what I was doing.  I'm not sure why but not a lot of films do that. The soundtrack music was catchy too. Its an interesting watch.  I would recommend it.,1352073600,9,500,4.081632653061225
2466578,4,B000CNESJE,"I'm not into the thriller genre, so I would never have watched this had it not been for Christian Kane. So I ""made the sacrifice"" and watched it to see what I knew was a great scene with Christian and his real life band (at the time, some changes since then)singing in a bar.

I was pleasantly surprised! Basically rich boy (Christian Kane), wants to marry good girl girlfriend (Jennifer Westfeldt)and she is not ready. So he pursues. Meanwhile she has casually met Gil Bellows and well... you can figure it out from here. Gil's wife has some interesting hobbies, Christian's father plays a role in the background, and in the end, it works more as a drama than a thriller. Let's say these people are all alive at the end, with all their limbs, something I don't expect from reading the box.

2466590,3,B000CNESJE,"Overall, a darn good movie, surprisingly so.
I had never heard of this movie, till I saw it on my local tv as the Saturday afternoon movie.  At first, I'll admit, I was very skeptical.  I had images in my mind of another bad low budget movie.  And while the directing was okay, the story was really good, despite being slightly corney and a little confusing in the beginning.  And some great laugh out loud dialogue.
Gil Belows (formerly of the tv series Ally McBeal) did a solid job playing a somewhat unhappy radio personality, whose marriage, it turns out, isn't as great as he had thought.  He didn't know this, until he starts receiving these anonymous notes, leaving him little bread crumbs of info.  Enter the his new friend, Melody (the actress who played her did an excellent job), who is going through her own issues with a male suitor.  They both help end up helping each other with their respective issues, and the movie ends with a climactic scene that will have you laughing and scratching your head with a smile.
Also his radio assistant, the odd Wit, was an interesting addition (played in Erin Brocovich as the man at the town local Water Board).

2466593,5,B000CNESJE,"Stu Pollard's second major release is an intricate and beautifully filmed psychological thriller. The film opens with a stunning visual presentation of the story's setting, Louisville, Ky., that makes the town look like a postcard. The bold colors of the setting match those of Pollard's characters in ""Keep Your Distance,"" which pay proper homage to the clannish and quirky nature of the people of in a modern town struggling to retain its Southern charm.

The pacing in the script was perfect...the story weaves wry humor, honest cynicism, and a disturbingly real underlying pathology and pathos, all necessary to pull off a complex psychological thriller. The emphasis is on psychology more than murder mystery, which makes the plot more interesting than that of the typical movie formula. The long pauses and intense looks that Pollard and his actors wove into the script give the audience doses of suspense, sadness, and humor in equal measure.

Particularly engrossing is the relationship between Melody and David, played by Jennifer Westfeldt and Gil Bellows. Their initial meeting is painfully awkward, but their connection is obvious from the start. Physical chemistry is there, but moreover, the characters have a bittersweet longing toward each other, and the world views they share have just enough cynicism to make their exchange edgy, and just enough idealism to make it romantic. Christian Kane is a standout as a wonderfully creepy and unpredictable jilted boyfriend. Kim Raver is notably strong as David's sexy, blatantly narcissistic wife.

The end of the movie is simple and satisfying. However, this film is more about the journey than the destination. Pollard has crafted a gripping story that relies on the fascinating trappings of human folly, whether based in conspiracy or naivete, to keeo the audience hooked.",1149811200,8,1835,5.298969072164948
2466594,4,B000CNESJE,"First, let me thank Stu Pollard for making quality movies about Louisville, Kentucky. It's a great city that's underrepresented in the movies. It's got the beauty, history, class, and sophisication of the big cities, and no reason it can't get it's moment to shine.

""Keep Your Distance"" follows the psychological torment of a beloved radio personality, David Dalley, played by Gil Bellows. ""Mr. Louisville"" has it all: great job, money, prestige, fame, and a hot wife (played by Kim Raver.) But mysterious letters arrive, and the cracks in the foundation grow. He catches his wife in bed with someone else (and it's not a guy.) He gets busted for DUI. And his assistant is after his job.

When a mysterious saleswoman arrives, David makes a relationship with her because he feels she can't betray him. But unknown to them, others are watching.

While it doesn't rise to Hitchcock levels of suspense, it's still a wild ride, and you feel for David as he plunges into madness.",1147651200,3,975,4.86144578313253

2466596,4,B000CNESJE,"Being a native Louisvillian, I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it.  It also helped that my best friend was a P.A. on the set the summer it was shot (summer of '03).  After seeing it with him on opening weekend, I said my only complaint was that it moved way too fast in the beginning... Here's David Daily, and BAM! he starts to be stalked.  My friend told me that after the opening at the Kentucky Center for the Arts, he and Stu (Pollard) got to talking about deleted footage.  Stu told him that they had to cut about a half hour from the film, and most of that ended up being character development and story building from the first part of the movie.

So, in short, if you didn't particularly like it the first time, watch it again.  The second time, when you understand why the characters are interacting the way they do, and you understand their motives, it is much easier to enjoy the story.

Again, I loved this movie and highly recommend it, but then again, I am partial (it makes me homesick every time I see it).",1146528000,2,1040,4.248730964467005
2466597,5,B000CNESJE,"I was incredibly lucky to be able to buy this film off Amazon as an Australian citizen I was not able to see it otherwise. And it was worth every cent I paid. With a compelling storyline and stylish cinematography on all levels `Keep Your Distance' is a film that will please any movie lover. As a film and television student I found this film to be a real inspiration! Not only is it an extremely well and skilfully written script but all characters have interesting and multi-layered personalities that keep the viewer enthralled in the somewhat twisted plot. Perfectly cast, this films supporting actors Christian Kane and Jamie Harrold in particular are not to be overlooked! They give not only give gripping and real performances but also bring a little extra to the film. Both are given for the first time roles which reveal the potential as actors. Director Stu pollard has managed to acquire the best of all actors' skills and has made every frame of this film a jewel.  This film will keep you guessing right up to the end. Not to be missed!",1144800000,2,1050,4.614973262032086
2466598,4,B000CNESJE,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film when it was screened at the 2006 East Lansing Film Festival, and I enjoyed it enough to purchase the DVD the very next day. The performances and direction are great, especially for an independent flick. Gil Bellows is a great actor, and keeps your interest throughout the film, but his surrounding cast is what really brings the film together. Jennifer Westfeldt most notably, gives a performance that is a keystone to this film. Christian Kane also plays his part with great intensity.

I recommend this movie, buy it, rent it; just see it.",1143763200,,580,4.742574257425742

I was especially impressed by the great casting, including Jennifer Westfeldt, Kim Raver (who is equally great in 24) and Stacy Keach from ""Prison Break"" fame.  It was a very entertaining story that kept you guessing all the way until the end about what was going to happen.  Got the DVD as a result of this viewing.  Highly recommended!",1143676800,3,431,4.558441558441558

8099498,4,B000CNESJE,"When the reviews say ""too slow,"" my ears perk up. Peoples' lives are often slow and lacking in extremes... when we're lucky. While the best movies have those dramatic highs and lows, increasingly I appreciate the little low-key pieces, like this one. It's kind of slow, sort of goofy, and meanders off when you wish it would be more to the point and focused. There were too many plot threads, and their resolution was somewhat hasty and contrived, but I enjoyed seeing a story where imperfect people found a way out of their dilemmas without ending up killing everyone in sight - it always seems easier to dwell on the dark in telling a story. This story was not without its dark strands - stalking, revenge, child sexual abuse. Could it have dug into those in a more tense, gritty, realistic way? Absolutely. What it did do, though, was dwell on the lead characters' resilience and humor in the face of disruption and disappointments in life. That's kind of hard to do, and that wins it an extra star from me.",1493424000,,1010,4.585635359116022
