5894346,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"Got this DVD because I was hitting a plateau with my regular Callanetics and yoga routines. Callanetics is great, but Callan Pinckney had only made a limited number of videos, so once you know all the exercises, your body knows them very well and kinda loses the challenge. Haven't tried Pilates yet, mainly because when it first came into vogue, I noticed more than half his movements were taken from Callan Pinckney, and the rest were yoga stretches/moves. Yet Pilates never acknowledged his sources (especially Pinckney).

This DVD is truly for beginners. You can easily follow the moves, especially if you've been doing yoga or Callanetics or other stretching exercises for a while. (If not, Ordway walks you through fewer reps and easier positions.) Ordway does mention various ways you can make the movements more advanced or challenging. I liked the way she chose Pilates moves that were adaptations of Callanetics, which meant I could use the same stretches I use with Callanetics but with more muscle and movement variation, creating a challenge for me--which was my original purpose in getting this DVD.  The exercises are good for maintaining suppleness and limberness in your muscles, and they give you a very good posture, especially if you're getting older and your body tends to curve at the spine. Pilates, like Callanetics and yoga, strengthens your core muscles (abdominals) and the lower spine, both of which are the foundation of your whole muscular and skeletal systems, respectively, making them stronger and able to carry your weight into old age. The stronger your core, the stronger your back, the flatter your tummy is, the less likely you are to shrink as you get older. Shrinking by quarters of an inch each year happens ""naturally"" as we age, but who says you have to give in to it sooner than you have to? The exercises in this DVD stretch your back all the time if you do them regularly, so you're always at your tallest and leanest. I'm already researching into the more advanced stage after this DVD. As a variation with Callanetics and yoga, this is really good!",1384732800,,2096,4.901408450704225
5894347,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"I recently started going to a Pilates reformer class and I wanted to find something that I could do at home.  While the mat practice is different, I thought that this was a very good DVD.  I think that some people might look at the ""beginners"" in the title and assume that it is too easy.  I think that it is a challenging workout (at least it leaves your muscles burning!) but it has very good instruction and cueing so that it is easier to follow if you are new to Pilates.",1384473600,,475,4.141304347826087
5894348,4,B00E8A0OZ4,So far so good.  Not my favorite Pilates DVD.  A little too slow and boring.  I like the exercises and the instructor.  I just wish she didn't take so many pauses.,1384387200,,163,4.161290322580645
5894349,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"This is my first Pilates workout as it was recommended by my chiropractor for my back issues. I didn't know what to expect but this was actually a great dvd. I love the scenerey and enjoy that fact that there are 3 20 min. workouts to choose from and not just one that was an hour long. I didn't expect to like pilates but now I look forward to doing one short workout a day to feel better. I thought it was just about stretching but it's not. It really does work the muscles so afterwards you feel it but in a good way.. not painful, just more of a strength training way, but not like a heavy weight training workout would feel. All I know is I felt better after just one workout and now after many of them I feel better than before I ever started. I plan to stick with Pilates!",1384214400,,779,4.064935064935065
5894350,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"I had never done pilates before and wasn't quite sure what to expect. Thankfully, the Element: Targeted Toning Pilates for Beginners DVD truly does start you at a beginners level. I was able to jump in and do the workouts straight away. As the host started out it felt like we were moving so slowly and I wasn't sure I would get any benefit from it. Boy was I wrong! By the end of the first workout my muscles were burning! The 3 toning workouts that are included are great!",1384214400,2,474,4.277777777777778
5894351,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that site for a more detailed version of my review.

Like all of the offerings in the Element series, TARGETED TONING PILATES FOR BEGINNERS is set in an outdoor garden with the ocean as a backdrop.  Most of the DVDs in this series feature two workouts, but this video provides three PLUS a bonus abs segment.  The practices are led by certified Pilates instructor Elizabeth Ordway, who teaches via voiceover and provides mirrored cuing.  The only prop required for these routines is a mat.  I have described the workouts in greater detail below.

TOTAL BODY LENGTHEN & STRENGTHEN (21:25 minutes)
Ordway begins in a seated position for breathing, lengthening, seated chest expansion, and seated side stretch.  Remaining seated, she also performs bicep curls, triceps turns, arm circles, and roll back (light weights could easily be added for these moves).  Ordway then transitions to the floor for bridge/single leg bridge.  Abs-focused work follows, including abs curl, hundred, face-up frog, roll-ups, single leg bicycles and circles, and scissors.  After performing back extensions, Ordway stretches with spine stretch forward and saw and then finishes with rolling like a ball.

LONG & LEAN WAISTLINE (23:10 minutes)
For this abs-focuses routine, Ordway starts with the single leg and double leg stretches to warm up, then continues with a move she calls ""barre legs.""  For the obliques, she performs an oblique crunch and criss-cross.  Seated moves include a spine twist and roll-up with rotation.  Next, Ordway moves into ""elephant"" (a.k.a. down dog), pulling in the knees to work the abs.  Coming back down to the floor, she performs single leg teaser and single leg rocker prep.  The final sequence includes tick-tock, cobra kicks, and in a side kneeling position, leg lifts and pass.  Ordway concludes with a mermaid stretch.

LOWER BODY LIFT & SCULPT (21:30 minutes)
This workout starts with a lengthy, thorough side kick series.  Ordway includes standard moves such as front/back, up/down, leg circles, and inner thigh lifts, but there are also some lesser-seen exercises, including knee dips, clamshells, and princess kicks.  For the last 5-6 minutes of this routine, Ordway performs an all-fours series that includes rear lifts, knee ins, and side karate kicks; between sides, she does a bird-dog, or alternating arm-leg balance, and this is how she concludes the workout.

CORE STRENGTHENER BONUS (10 minutes)
The section starts with a simple abdominal curl.  Ordway gradually ups the challenge, first lifting the feet to chair position and then to raised perpendicular to the ground.  Additional crunch versions include four-point crunch and targeted oblique touch.  Ordway then moves through criss-cross and single leg extension, and for her ""grand finale,"" she combines these two moves.  She finishes with a lying full-body stretch.

I enjoyed these routines.  I like adding on Pilates to my other workouts, and so the length of these sessions felt just about perfect to me:  Ordway moves along at a nice, measured pace, and the time went by quickly.  However, as someone who has been practicing Pilates for over ten years and who considers myself to be at an approximately intermediate level, I disagree with the ""for beginners"" label of this DVD.  Ordway does offer some modifications, particularly during the total body workout, when she performs fewer repetitions and other easier versions of some classic Pilates moves.  Otherwise, however, Ordway includes some much more challenging exercises (e.g., corkscrew), and she does not provide the level of instruction that would be necessary for those truly new to Pilates.  For this reason, I would take a 1/2 star off my rating and rate the DVD at about 4 1/2 stars, as I would ONLY recommend the DVD for experienced Pilates practitioners and above.",1383868800,6,3928,5.184126984126984
5894352,5,B00E8A0OZ4,I had no idea what Pilates was all about until I tried the Pilates For Beginners With Instructor Elizabeth Ordway DVD.  I have had a hip replacement and I am no spring chick.  This DVD worked out great for me as it wasn't so intense that I couldn't do it.  It is a great way to learn what Pilates is all about.  I really enjoyed it as did my Daughter and Granddaughter.,1381363200,24,369,4.083333333333333

5894376,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"I like this disk and it's a good workout, but I'm glad that I'm somewhat versed in Pilates; I decided to give this one a go because my other tape (yep my VHS tape - I'll admit it) was damaged.  The setting is gorgeous and the workout is challenging.
If you're truly a Pilates beginner. with absolutely no experience with it, I would recommend Winsor Pilates for Beginners with Ana Caban; she walks you through the language, the technique, the breathing, and helps you focus on the parts of the body you're working in her 10 minute intro.  That one also has modifications if you're not up the the instructor's level of strength yet.",1474243200,7,631,4.526315789473684

You can do one or all four of the workouts and feel great about it, I saw a difference in my body almost immediately, and when I was lazy and took time off from exercise for a few months and started doing this routine again a few days later my husband said "" you look good, have you been working out?""

5894382,5,B00E8A0OZ4,This is a great workout. I thought it was going to be another basic Pilates DVD but I'm a DVD junkie so I thought I'd try it.

5894394,3,B00E8A0OZ4,Elizabeth moves very quickly through the moves and does not explain things very well. I guess this would be better for a person more advanced in pilates.,1449619200,3,153,4.703703703703703

5894400,1,B00E8A0OZ4,"This is suppose to be for beginners  (i.e. to learn from). Firstly the speed at which she demonstrates them is too fast for a beginner.  Secondly it has the most annoying & fast background music which is too high and makes it hard to listen to what he instructor is saying.  (I bought it because of the clip on youtube). It has been filmed in a nice location, but at times the camera concentrates more on the view and the landscape rather than the moves she is doing . Basically it is a waste of money if you are a beginner and are purchasing it to learn from it.",1431820800,4,563,4.146788990825688
5894401,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"Always thought I was in decent shape until I dried Pilates with this DVD. Wow, it was a wake up call for my core! If you listen to her instructions very carefully and be consistent with this workout, you'll immediately see results with your waistline and posture. I'm in my early 40's and wish I knew about Pilates in my 20's. I was around a 32-33 waistline before and now I'm a 29-30. I have tried other videos and this is still my favorite. Just be patient and don't give up if you find this hard. The results will come!",1430870400,28,522,4.23
5894402,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"I like this work out DVD very much. It has 2 shorter segments which is good if you are short on time. Even thought the workouts are only 20-30 minutes, they are still a good work out. I like how she continually talks through the whole work out with little reminders that help you get the most out of the exercises. This method is also good for beginners who are new to pilates.",1429228800,7,377,4.178082191780822
5894413,3,B00E8A0OZ4,"It's a great workout. It got my entire body sore.  The only thing I don't like is the narrator isn't very good at narrating when to breathe.  The voice over doesn't always match up with what's happening (sometimes the commands are delayed) It's not a deal breaker, but a big part of pilates is knowing when to breathe in vs out.
Pros: good work out
great exercises for beginners
Cons: voice over commands are often delayed with the action
breathing commands aren't given consistently

Overall, due to poor walk through, I would say this cd really isn't the most appropriate for a beginner",1424217600,4,588,4.689320388349515

5894422,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"I am new to Pilates and I used to be in great shape and got out of shape. When I first tried the workouts I thought they were too difficult, but after doing them a few times they seemed much easier and now I do one workout every day. I love the soothing voice of the instructor and I am able to do all the movements. Each routine is only about 20 minutes long. The one for the lower body is excellent. The next day you will feel pleasantly sore like you worked your muscles but you won't be dying of pain. Even if you are a beginner, I would give this DVD a try and just do your best until it gets easier. I have had some flexibility issues in the past but this workout never caused me any pain. (One last thing, you need a large area of the floor to do this because at times your are on your back with your hands over your head.)",1410220800,4,830,3.9171597633136095

5894437,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"This workout looks deceptively easy. Well, it's not! I've been more that a little frustrated because my body doesn't want to do these moves...turns out I am going to have to work at this quite a bit. Baby steps...practice and more practice. The one thing I do like is it doesn't have a lot of jogging, jiggling, panting and profuse sweating. My daughter really likes this video...but she is 35 years younger and moves like the wind.",1388448000,2,432,4.623376623376624
5894438,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"Like all the Element DVDs I own, this is filmed outdoors in a lovely peaceful green outdoor setting with natural lighting.  It is cued in voiceover.  As is also common with Element, there is just one exerciser demonstrating the exercises (so there is a more intimate vibe, but you have no modifiers for more or less intensity).

This is a good strong start for a pilates practice, and it is a nice daily practice for those experience in pilates who don't feel like ""going for bear"" that day but still want a good workout.  The pace is slow (not that pilates is ever frantic, but this slower).  Beginners will not feel overwhelmed because you will have time to set up and position for each move (likewise, the moves are well sequenced and flow into one another).  There is lots of cuing, lots of explanation of what you are doing, form pointers (the downside being that those who like silence will probably feel like she never stops talking).

In spite of the slow pace, some of the moves are deeper and some are more challenging than other beginner moves.  You are encouraged to challenge but not push yourself.

Those who have a very, very significant amount of weight to lose will possibly find difficulty getting into some of the positions.  But barring that or any mobility or weight bearing issues, this would suit most any beginner.

Background music is something soft and dull but not annoying.  I'm pretty sure I've heard it in other element DVDs.",1387411200,2,1455,4.662745098039216

This has been a really good one to start with.  There are three different workouts so I don't get bored and each one gives me a full, well-rounded workout.  The production values are very high so the teacher's movements are clear and easy to see.  This is a very good pilates video.",1387065600,,509,4.270833333333333
5894440,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"This targeted Pilates DVD for Beginners was just what I was looking for.  The video is shot from angles that make all the moves very easy to follow, and the verbal instructions are also very clear.  The 20-minute sections target different areas of the body, and there is a bonus core workout.  I like having the option of picking just one or watching all of them in one long session. I was not sore the day after beginning these, but I could tell I'd worked out.

This is a great DVD for people who want to start pilates!",1387065600,5,521,4.285714285714286
5894441,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"I've tried pilates once or twice in the past, but it's never been a major part of my exercise routine.  But I've been looking for more exercise DVDs to try out in the comfort of my home, and trying to push myself beyond yoga and jogging, so when I saw that this DVD had relatively short workouts (three 20 minute programs) I thought it would be worth trying.

In each workout, I thought the instructor did a great job of explaining where the move should target and what the viewer should be experiencing - I think this is always especially important in home exercise videos since no one's around to tell you if you're doing something incorrectly.  Some of the positions were very challenging because my balance is poor, but at other times the stretches really felt great.  I think that some of the moves were a bit advanced for a mere beginner, but maybe I just felt especially self-conscious because I was struggling with something that Elizabeth Ordway did with such ease.

Not being all that familiar with traditional pilates, I didn't notice anything unusual about the stretches, but some of the moves are ""invented"" or modified by Ordway so pilates purists may not like her changes.  But then again, it might provide a nice break from the usual routine.",1386979200,,1258,4.669683257918552
5894442,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"This Pilates program is definitely meant for beginners.  None of the exercises were too difficult for someone just starting out.  In fact, if anyone has a knowledge of yoga, this is an easy switch, although it is trying.  The DVD is divided into 3 exercise videos, each about 20 minutes long, focusing on different areas.  The instructor is engaging and knowledgeable and there is nothing cheesy about it (unlike some other exercise videos).  The disc also includes a fourth exercise sequence to target specific skills and areas.  You will definitely feel these exercises in your abs!",1386806400,16,584,5.03125
5894453,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"First, I must start off by stating that I've never attended a Pilates class nor have I ever been exposed to Pilates before this DVD. I am a complete newbie. With that said I cannot comment on how authentic or good this instructional video is compared to other or other classes.

I found ""Targeted Toning Pilates for Beginners"" to be very well done. The instructions on how to do the exercises are clear and concise and very easy to understand. The exercises themselves are for supposed to be designed for beginners, but I'm wondering how much of a beginner, because some seemed a little above my abilities at this point. I am getting better, so am anxious to continue and see the results.

The three twenty minute workouts are for the following targeted areas: waistline, lower body, and total body. Also included is a shorter 10 minute focus on core strengthening. These are all done on the floor, making it pretty much necessary to have a mat for comfort. (If you don't have one, make sure to pick one up when purchasing this DVD)

The exercises are low-impact and very effective. I've found muscles I had no idea I had and certainly can feel them after working out. After only a week of doing the exercises, I noticed I was feeling feeling a bit more limber and my body felt better. This is perfect for those days when I really want to stretch and loosen up my middle-aged muscles. I am looking forward to how I'm going to be feeling after using this long-term if what I'm feeling now is a hint of what is to come.

I love how this DVD is filmed. It has a beautifully serene background, but the music seems just a little too loud and there are places I have trouble hearing the instructor. Maybe it's nothing more than my not hearing as well any more, but it is something that causes me have to go back and listen to the instructor/instructions more than once. However, once I understand the exercise, I no longer notice that and enjoy the music while exercising.",1386720000,6,1966,4.49859943977591

The instructor is Elizabeth Ordway. She is a great instructor and did a wonderful job explaining the moves and how to get different results.  She broke them down so they were very easy to follow along with the DVD. This isn't for a Pilates purist as some forms are designed by Ms. Ordway. Personally I like the newer exercises and feel they add to the work out. The production on this is wonderful, the audio is clear and the videography was great.

I think this is geared to someone who is familiar with how Pilates works and has had at least one class.  This DVD as it seems a little more advanced than some of my beginner ones.  A great DVD to add to your exercise collection",1386547200,2,1072,4.471794871794872

The instructor is all right. Teaching to an audience that cannot ask questions requires the instructor to address each stretch thoroughly. I was able to follow Ordway easily, but I'm not sure it was perfect for beginners.

This DVD is best viewed as a stepping stone for budding pilates enthusiasts. It won't necessarily give you a full workout, but certainly enough that you'd be able to go into a class with some understanding of what's going on.",1386547200,4,669,4.964285714285714

The video contains 3  20 minute workouts targeting different body areas. I began with the long lean waistline workout.  Elizabeth Ordway has been doing this for so long I am under the belief that she has forgotten what a beginner is.

This is the first time that I have tried Pilates, having previous used the yoga videos by Elements, I was hoping for a more introductory pace than what was offered.  I have gone back to this video a couple of times, but each time felt that I was way out of my league for a beginner.

Back to the yoga video where I still see results without the physical pain and frustration associated with this video.",1385856000,3,908,4.395209580838324

While I've practiced yoga, I had little knowledge of Pilates. That's where this DVD comes in, and it was an excellent choice for teaching me the basics of Pilates. It's above my level, since I'm at square one, which is good, because that means I won't grow out of it for a while. For as much as I was able to do, I felt like I really accomplished a healthful routine. It wasn't so far above my ability I couldn't get a nice rush from the experience. I'm very, very happy with what this DVD provided.",1385856000,3,670,4.5
5894458,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"Targeted Toning Pilates for Beginners with Elizabeth Ordway is a DVD with 3 20-minute workouts and 1 10-minute bonus one that combine classic Pilates moves with ones designed by the instructor herself.  The instructions are clear and the workout a perfect level of challenging and possible.

Pilates is typically done on a mat so it doesnt require standing but some balance is still necessary.  However, when you are close to the floor, losing your balance is not as worrisome.  The instructor, Elizabeth Ordway is lovely to watch as she flows through her elegant movements.  There were times I was not clear about how to sync my breath with the move because her instruction was not clear.  I think that with a few more viewings I'll get to where I know when to inhale and exhale, practice being key to getting it right.

The DVD allows you to choose one of the three 20-minute workouts or play all three.  Unfortunately, it does not allow you to mix and match so you will work through them from first to last.  Don't expect a warm-up or cool-down because Pilates has an emphasis on working the core through stretches and balancing.  Someday when I can do all three, I'll be thrilled to do so.  For now, I was happy I was able to get through the first two with little difficulty and, even when something was challenging it was never discouraging.  I really like this DVD and it's a welcome addition to my collection.

To the DVD distribution company, however, I have one very clear complaint.  I see no point in added a cardboard sleeve to the DVD case when the content on the sleeve duplicates what is on the case.  Less packaging, in this day and age, is not something to be taken lightly.  While I would not think twice to buy a DVD with this instructor, I would think twice before buying a DVD from your company for this reason.",1385856000,3,1832,4.539634146341464
5894459,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this beyond some yoga-like movements that might trim some fat and build muscle, but I really liked this DVD. I am a dancer and have a once-a-week personal trainer, so I am in pretty good shape, but I don't stretch as much as I should, and my back, glutes, and legs can sometimes get a little messed up from overworking without warming up. This DVD was perfect for me because, while the ""exercise"" component wasn't really there for me (very easy), the movements had a therapeutic quality to them.

The instructor actually did a great job explaining pilates both conceptually and in terms of how different movements could achieve different results. The demonstration of those movements was clear and easy to follow, as well, so there was no getting lost and feeling silly the way that some workout videos can do.

Don't expect some crazy cardio-burning workout with high intensity movements. This is a Beginner's DVD that shows some basic pilates movements and will help Start your muscles moving and stretching. Good stuff!",1385769600,4,1056,4.861111111111111

I also think this would be great for those that work from home and are looking to add something during the day to get their metabolism going again. A little mid day jump-start that doesn't necessarily make you sweat but targets specific areas. The pace is good. I really like that there was no bouncing on the knees. (Maybe that's what Pilates is all about, I don't know.) She spends some time explaining each exercise, which is great. Once you are familiar with the exercises, I suppose you could just add another rep in so you're not 'waiting' for her to start. Right now though, the pace is perfect for me and I can definitely feel muscles being challenged. I would recommend this for all ages.",1385510400,2,859,4.443037974683544

I would hobble around, wincing everytime I had to climb stairs.  I kinda thought Element: Targeted Toning Pilates for Beginners would be a super-easy work-out.  I was wrong.

This exercise video is not easy.  It challenged me to focus on various muscles and really think about the movements.  I have never taken a Pilates class before, this dvd was the first.

Positives:
*I like that there are three, 20 minute sessions to choose from.
*The movements aren't too difficult to execute.
*The instructor has a soothing voice.  No barking like a drill instructor (I'm looking at you Body Combat)
*Good transitions between exercies.
*I felt nicely stretched after twenty minutes.
*Short enough to keep my ADD mind from wandering.
* I felt a nice burn after.  No wincing in pain.

Negatives:
*I wish there was one or two more classes.  It gets repetitious.
*It doesn't seem like it was made for beginners.",1385510400,,1041,4.942196531791907

These are listed as beginners workouts but I've always found Pilates workouts challenging, and these are no exceptions. What's nice is that they are slow and you can pace yourself depending on your fitness level. I need to pace myself sometimes!

I liked these workouts. There are three twenty minute workouts, plus a ten minute bonus workout, just for strengthening your core, so there's lots of variety.  The teacher seems really good and the background scenery is beautiful, a green lawn and garden overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
I wish my workout space was so pretty!  Recommended!",1385424000,11,814,4.671328671328672
5894463,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"This DVD has 4 workouts.  3 are the main advertised ones and the 4th is a short core workout.
They are:
1. The Total body Workout: 21:25 minutes long
2. Long & Lean Waistline Workout: 23:10 minutes long
3. Lower body Lift & Sculpt Workout: 21:30 minutes long
4. Core Strengthener: 11:15 minutes long

Having done Pilates for a number of years, I figured these workouts would be familiar and they were.  However the author: Elizabeth Ordway has added a few unique twists which I enjoyed.  I found the following:
The total body workout, had a great arm routine that will be great for most office workers, who suffer from weak shoulders after years of slouching (guilty here). I also found this was a very accessible workout.  Most people can do this.
Long & Lean Waistline, I felt was not as basic as the total body workout. This is a pet peeve of mine.  When it says beginner, it should be doable by most people or with modifications for those that have limitations. I found the author did not do modifications, so it is  a case of do or not do.  Having done pilates for years I could do all of the routines, but they were hard. Also with a single yoga mat on a hard surface this can be a bit rough on your tail bone.
Lower body Lift & Sculpt was nicely tiring.  I felt this was accessible to the beginner.  But, they may not be able to do the number of reps or all the exercises called for in this.  That is okay, as at least they can do some and work up to the rest.
The extra core workout, might be a good one to help you prep for the Long & Lean Waistline.  This was very doable.

Overall this is a decent set of routines to get you into Pilates.

The best way to approach this is, to watch the routines though first once, so you are aware of technique and transitions.  Then the first few times you do the routines they will seem fast as you are trying to watch and do.  Finally the instructions will make sense and you can just follow by listening.  The speed then seems more appropriate.

As with prior element DVDs, I have owned however I have complained about the background music being too loud.  This one was also a bit much, but not as bad as it seemed in a Yoga routine.  Maybe I see Pilates as being more physical and Yoga being more mental.  Then the music seems like noise and inappropriate to the routine..

I will continue to do these exercises and report back on what long term use does for me. With my prior Pilates experience, I know the results should be as promised.",1385424000,2,2488,4.2601279317697225
5894464,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"These are nice focused workouts. The narration is very clear and easy to follow. Particularly if you are a beginner.

5894465,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"I liked this video more than I thought I would. After just one 20-minute session I felt taller, holding myself better, and honestly did have more energy. The instructor was pretty clear, although I'll have to go through it a few times to really 'get it.' So far I've just done the total body workout. I look forward to trying the other 2 sessions, and the bonus core program. It's a great way to get back into exercise after a looong break.",1385251200,,440,4.378048780487805
5894466,5,B00E8A0OZ4,"From the first workout session, you will definitely ""feel the burn"" so to speak.  This is a calm workout where you can safely stretch your joints and muscles and not have to worry about any impact issues.  However, I found it very challenging from the start.  The exercises she selects look simple enough to do and she explains them well, but if you don't work out all that often like me, you will quickly learn that simple doesn't mean easy.

I think this is an excellent video for someone who already knows the basics of Pilates- it might be a little challenging for someone new- but if you're willing to stick with it and just do what you can, I found that at the end of each session I felt so much stronger and stable.  My muscles (particularly in the abs area) were tight and I held my stomach in with seemingly no effort.  It's just what the muscles wanted to do.  And-even though I'm pretty short-- I felt taller when I walked around!",1385164800,2,941,4.373563218390805
5894467,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"Please don't be fooled by the for beginners tag on this DVD.  This is definitely an intermediate workout.  If you are brand new to pilates, do yourself a favour and find another video.

However, if youve had some experience with pilates, this is a great DVD to add to your collection.  It features three workouts  Total Body Workout, Long Lean Waistline, Lower Body Lift & Sculpt  each approximately 22 minutes long.  There is also a bonus 10 minute Core Strengthener workout.

Like most Element productions, this DVD has high production values.  Filmed in a garden overlooking the ocean, it has lots of different camera angles, allowing you to see the exercises from different vantage points.

5894469,1,B00E8A0OZ4,"I've never done pilates before, and only ever done the tiniest bit of yoga (and that yoga is through the Wii Fit). I've been mostly sedentary for years, with my idea of exercise being walking the three-mile loop in my neighborhood (and walking up and down the stairs carrying my one-year-old). I was interested in trying a new type of exercise to try to tone my body, so I thought I'd give this pilates DVD a try.

On Tuesday morning, I tried the first routine on the disc, Total Body Lengthen & Strengthen. During the workout, I felt the good kind of burn, though my abs complained ""hey, what's up? you know this isn't what we're meant for!"" Some of the parts of the routine were more difficult than others, and I had to orient myself so I could always be watching the screen to be sure I was doing it right, but it was hard to remember sometimes when I was supposed to be inhaling and when I was supposed to be exhaling: instructor Elizabeth Ordway would throw all the information about the move at you as you're beginning, including which parts to inhale and exhale on; sometimes as you're doing repetitions, she'd remind you when to inhale and exhale, while other times she'd remind you what you're doing, or provide information on this movement will tone; unless she was reminding us of inhales or exhales, it was easy to quickly forget (in the bulk of information provided immediately, when trying to copy what she's doing on the screen) when to breathe. If you already have a decent background in pilates and/or yoga (and are therefore not really a BEGINNER), I imagine you'd know when to breathe for these sorts of exercises, but I have no such background. There were a few parts of the routine where she offered an ""easier"" version if what you were doing hurt your back, but on others you were expected to do it exactly as Ms. Ordway did, regardless of the difficulty.

After a warm shower following completion of the 20-minute routine, I went about my normal day's routine, no complaints from my muscles. Not until I was going to bed Tuesday night, when I started to feel a bit of burn in my abs. Wednesday morning, however, my abs were in agony. Doing anything that activated those muscles hurt: a coughing fit at lunch, bending down to pick my son up out of his crib, sitting up from a recline, etc. My abs were still sore when I went to bed Wednesday night. Thursday morning, I forced myself to get up and turn on the second routine on the disc, Long & Lean Waistline. I lasted into that routine about 3 minutes before I had to give up because my abs simply could not take it.

I would hardly consider this to be a workout DVD for beginners. When you start one of the workouts, Ms. Ordway leads right into the routine, no preparatory warm-up stretching at the beginning, and there is no cool-down at the end. You need to know that you need to stretch beforehand and cool-down afterwards  and if you're a beginner, you probably (I don't) don't know what appropriate warm-ups and cool-downs are for this type of exercise. I didn't even realize that until my husband, who works out considerably more than I do, pointed it out to me.

If you have no experience with this type of exercise, I would heavily recommend that you look into a different workout routine instead of this one. I would only recommend this ""for beginners"" DVD to people who already have a beginner's level of understanding of the basics and core strength.",1384992000,12,3435,4.524959742351046
5894470,5,B00E8A0OZ4,This is a useful and usable dvd.  I am definitely a beginner again after a fifth baby and a month stuck in bed.  I have no muscle strength or tone left to speak of.  When I tried this workout I was very challenged and honestly could not do even half of it.  Many of the positions were too much for my stomach particularly.  This dvd uses core/stomach muscles almost continually and there are different levels shown and it is adaptable to the point that I think it would be useful for most skill levels.  The instructer and narration are pleasant as is the setting and music.  A great exercise dvd.,1384905600,,597,4.372727272727273
5894471,3,B00E8A0OZ4,"I have never done pilates before but wanted to try something in the privacy of my own home, especially if I am out of shape as I think I am. I am not a fan of exercising in public so this dvd was a chance to work out at home.

I just started the program and hope that I will be able to continue with it. It isn't easy like some of the other programs I have tried, but I do feel like I am getting a work out, which is what I wanted. Have I seen any results yet? No. I just started and I think I will need to complement this with walking on the days I don't use this work out.

I find it better this way than to join a class at the local Y. It is a good start for a new work out plan especially for someone who hasn't exercised in a long time.",1384905600,3,741,3.625
5894472,4,B00E8A0OZ4,"Elizabeth Ordway is so strong and flexible that she makes all the exercises on this DVD look elegant. Her voice is also very pleasant. The setting is also gorgeous with lots of greenery and flowers in a garden overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The music by Daveed also makes the whole experience relaxing for the mind all while the body is working out pretty hard. I will say this workout is more for those who are intermediate to advanced.

The exercises are divided up into three 20-minute workouts. There is also a 10-minute Core Strengthener which is mostly crunches and other exercises like criss cross with leg extensions. Some of the exercises lengthen and flatten the abs.

The three main workouts include:

Total Body Workout - This will relax you all while making you feel the burn. Some moves are advanced and require strong abs. The exercises include arm circles, frog, roll up, leg circles, swan (very modified) and rolling like a ball.

Long & Lean Waistline Workout - Even though this is for the abs you will be using your legs a lot and your legs might start shaking. The exercises include single leg stretch, double leg stretch, criss cross, single leg teaser, corkscrew, double leg lifts and mermaid. There are also some moves from yoga like cobra and downward dog that the instructor calls elephant for some reason.

Lower Body Lift & Sculpt Workout - This segment tones the butt and includes exercises that you will recognize as a leg series. Grasshopper and cat/cow are also exercises to enjoy.

If you do all three segments at one time you are going to be quite worn out and will probably feel sore the next day as I did. To be honest the music on this DVD makes everything seem easier than the exercises really are. This is challenging. I'd only recommend this for intermediates.
