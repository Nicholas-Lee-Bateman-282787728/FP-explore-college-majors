8631958,3,B00HEM9Q3E,"It was alright as far as b-movies go, but - SPOILER ALERT - there is one thing that I cannot get over. One of the girls gets her hands on a gun. When the bad guy is standing 100-200 feet away with a machete, after they've already seen him kill their friend, does she shoot the guy? of course not! She and her friends turn and run away! Later on, when the killer is under the bed and grabs her leg, she has the gun in her hands, but does she shoot him? Of course not! Once again the bimbo runs away, carrying the gun with her. If you're not going to USE a gun for self-defense, why on Earth are you carrying it!?! Aside from that, the girls couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag. I wouldn't suggest this movie unless you enjoy picking apart plot holes and idiotic script writing.",1498176000,,786,4.077419354838709

8631962,2,B00HEM9Q3E,"The film opens with Amber (Markie Collins) being at home alone in her remote California paradise home. She hangs out by the pool in her bikini and showers, clearly behaving in a manner that would invite a stalker. She is killed and later a group of girls use the home for spring break. Because of circumstances Rachel (Sharon Hinnendael) must take along her two sisters one of which is very moody (Morissa O'Mara) and anti-social. The girls hang out by the pool in their bikinis and shower expecting Shane (Robert Adamson) and two frat boys at any time. Rachel plans on doing ""things that would make my father's head explode.""

The film had everything in place, soundtrack, babes, slasher, etc. but failed to capitalize on it. There was no terror. Characters not developed. The dialogue was dry. And I am still wondering why we were shown the killer in the first scene and what that had to do with anything.

8631963,1,B00HEM9Q3E,"Jim Valdezs Machine Head is a triple threat. The acting is abysmal, the directing is bush league, and the writing is incoherent nonsense. And whats worse is the movie seems to be competing with itself to see which aspect is worse than the others. If you pass this at any store, or Netflix, avoid it at all costs.",1409356800,,312,4.396551724137931

8631965,2,B00HEM9Q3E,"When I see a movie cover like the one above, I am usually always interested.  I mean, how could I not be?  Three hot girls, covered in blood, standing on a highway while one totes an axthere are so many awesome concepts here.  And throw in the intriguing yet mysterious title, MACHINE HEAD, and youve got instant curiosity, certainly more than enough to raise this horror-lovers eyebrow.  Unfortunately, killer artwork and an ambiguous title are not enough to salvage this film.

I really wanted this movie to be so much more than it is.  And while I tried to find something in it to enjoy, I couldnt.  There are just simply too many things wrong with it.

Given the films synopsis, we are led to believe MACHINE HEAD probably deals with a mechanic or race car driver who uses his car in his killings or even kills people on the highway.  Sadly, this is not the case.  The majority of the film takes place in the vacation house, and the only ties to anything gear-head related is a muscle car that we see the killer driving in a couple of scenes.

I also have a problem with the three main characters, portrayed by Sharon Hinnendael, Nicole Zeoli, and Christina Corigliano.  We are given no reason whatsoever to care about them.  They are three snobby rich girls who have no relatable traits to the audience, therefore I felt no suspense at any point throughout the movie.  The killer could have offed them in the first 10 minutes of the film, and I could have cared less.

And speaking of the killer, what is his motive?  Who is he, and why does he look like a Tom Savini stand-in?  If hes supposed to be cold and ruthless, why does he use the doorbell to torment the girls in the house?  There are many questions I have about this guy, however my biggest one is this:  why does this slasher flick not have any real slashes in it?

All in all, I just have to give this film a thumbs-down.  Ive loved or liked 99% of the Anchor Bay titles Ive seen, however this one falls into that tiny 1% of those I wish I hadnt.  Hopefully, director Jim Valdez will learn from this film and go on to make better ones.  I would hate for MACHINE HEAD to be the pinnacle of his career.",1397088000,4,2168,4.338308457711443

Surprisingly good for a low budget thriller!",1395792000,,137,4.3076923076923075
8631967,5,B00HEM9Q3E,"The film starts sweetly with some friends going to a cool, modern house in the desert...the girls are gorgeous but they didn't figure on having to take some little sisters along.  Heading to the desert they start getting messed with by an unknown - and unseen - guy in some kind of modified drag car.  What seems like innocent flirtation becomes anything but when ""machine head"" secretly follows and wreaks havoc - and death - on what started as a hip week in the desert.
