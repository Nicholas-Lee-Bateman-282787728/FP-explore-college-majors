The story begins with a man on a wagon. He hears gunshots. Riders are shooting at the ""Rock River Advocate"" newspaper building. A man goes out on the porch to shoot at the retreating riders. Can a new marshal clean up this part of Wyoming territory? The Citizens Committee want to effect change. Marshal Luke Graham brings a letter to Editor Ross; he called in the Range Busters. A stagecoach is robbed and Davis the driver is shot. Crash and Dusty arrive to rescue Grace Ross. They will search for clues about these robbers. Editor Ross has a new printer's devil. Jim Dawson plans to bump off one of the Range Busters. Crash visits the bar, and fights against some of the men there. Elmer gives his opinions. Grace gets engaged to Jim Dawson! Alibi passes the news.

Crash sings a song; or does he? There is humor here. ""Nice day, isn't it?"" The death of Davis leads to the formation of a Vigilance Committee headed by Jim Dawson. Can they frame Crash and Dusty for the robbery and murder? Can Alibi take charge of those men in order to free Crash and Dusty? Is there a clue in that old shack? Marshal Luke returns with the story of Jim Dawson's past record. There is an unexpected meeting at that old shack. The bad guys are defeated. Can special horseshoes create a false trail? So there will be a happy ending for Grace and Luke.

This is a very low budget film with two of the ""Three Mesquiteers"". It has the usual plots: a local man of prominence who is in cahoots with the villains, heroes who are wrongly under suspicion, etc. Can anyone tie on a horseshoe? Only in this movie.",1287792000,,1618,4.441077441077441
7859556,4,6304042736,"Monogram Pictures presents ""ROCK RIVER RENEGADES"" (27 February 1942) (59 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- With the success of Republic's Three Mesquiteers, several forces came together around 1940 to develop a new 'trigger trio' for the screen --- The star was Ray 'Crash' Corrigan, a producer named George W. Weeks and Monogram Pictures --- With a character of his own name. Ray starred in 20 of the 24 films in this series between 1940 and 1943 --- The Range Busters was clearly a lower budget copy of the Mesquiteers --- Big, muscular Ray 'Crash' Corrigan was the lead, the second lead was John 'Dusty' King, a big band singer (Ben Bernie Orchestra) with a reasonably good baritone, who would vocalize a tune or two in each film --- And comic relief was in the hands of ventriloquist Max 'Alibi' Terhune (and his wise-cracking dummy Elmer --- Monogram would distribute the Range Busters but not be directly involved in the productions --- The deal gave Corrigan a substantial share of the film profits (in an interview years later, Ray said he received 50%).
