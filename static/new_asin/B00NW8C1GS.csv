8680725,5,B00NW8C1GS,"Who am I No System is Safe is a pretty good, German language (English subtitles) film revolving around Benjamin, a young social loser in the real world, but with awesome computer skills who while on community service after trying to use his skills to impress a girl went wrong, he meets a social disorder player who is way cooler in the real world than him.  Benjamin and some other society interrupters team up to form CLAY (Clowns Laughing at You) that expose and humiliate corporations doing unethical things.  They quickly become German antiheroes.  But the biggest player in the dark web Mr X has plans for them.  Benjamin is going to have to use all his computer skills as well as some real world skills the others have been teaching him, to get out of this one alive.

What's good about this is that it acknowledges that to get into company/government systems, you can't just do it from behind a computer screen with a keyboard, you've got to get into the buildings and have access to hardware at some point in a company's intraweb.  It's quite a clever and well made movie with likable characters.",1508284800,,1105,4.641025641025641

This exciting film will let you breathless due its kinetic rhtyhm. Edition, acting and unpredictable situations that will expose you what's behind our supposed welfare.
