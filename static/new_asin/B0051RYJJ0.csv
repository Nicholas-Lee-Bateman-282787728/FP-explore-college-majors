4525884,5,B0051RYJJ0,Great 60s TV.  Well written with one of the best jazz soundtracks (or of any venue) if you like acoustic jazz.  Good reproduction for its time.,1410652800,,143,4.461538461538462

4525886,5,B0051RYJJ0,"I loved watching  Peter Gunn with my father and brothers when it originally ran. It still holds up well.
And the DVD picture and sound quality is near excellent.",1378684800,,161,4.551724137931035
4525887,5,B0051RYJJ0,"This set has the second season of the fantastic Peter Gunn series. Part (but ONLY part) of the first season had previously been released in two sets here in the US years ago, but the show ran for THREE seasons so this new addition is awesome.

Production quality is fine. No extras of any kind, not even the little intros they used to have for commercial breaks.

This season is full of good episodes and you can't find them anywhere else. So go buy a PAL player that's ""Region Free"" and have at it. Such DVD players can be had for well under $100. Believe me, Peter Gunn and it's Mancini background music are worth it. With a PAL player you can also shop for the missing B&W Roger Moore ""Saint"" episodes that never aired in the US (networkdvd.net).

BTW, in the THIRD season of Peter Gunn Edie gets her own fancy restaurant and a new character (the maitre'd) is introduced. ""Mother"" is dropped. Perhaps that last season will be released someday. For now, having the second season available is a giant step in the right direction.",1344470400,3,1030,4.497326203208556
4525888,5,B0051RYJJ0,As good as it gets.  A great TV series with outstanding atmosphere.  The first season can be had by purchasing sets 1 and 2.  All we need now is for season 3 to become available.,1321920000,3,178,4.0285714285714285

8453156,5,B0051RYJJ0,"The slickest private eye series in TV history, in my opinion. The music done by Henry Mancini and produced by Blake Edwards. Also resulting in a sort of a spin off called ""Mr. Lucky"" based on a 1940s Cary Grant movie. If you like Sam Spade, and Phillip Marlow, you'll love this one.",1455062400,,282,4.339622641509434
