Unfortunately the quality of the tape is not good, so I can't watch it anymore. This is a great, smart thriller with good perfomances by Elliot Gould and especially Christopher Plummer. This is a kind of thriller that seldom get's made these days. Finally this forgotten classic can be enjoyed again.",1153612800,5,407,4.368421052631579

Needs to be put on DVD. though i have not seen it in 10+ years I still remember the suspense and that great and rare feeling you get when you know you've just seen a great movie. a movie where all the artistic pieces- writing, acting, cinematography, music etc. have come together and done their job. drawing you into the story.  just dropped by to buy the video..........",1108166400,2,460,4.275862068965517
885174,5,6304435886,"Seeing this movie when originally released, I remember the energy, the suspense, at how things were going to turn out. Christopher Plummer is the baddest of bad guys here (you'll never be able to view ""The Sound of Music"" the same way again). Elliot Gould is terrific, especially as we watch his character go from being in over his head to in control.
Note: this was penned by Curtis Hanson, who brought us ""L.A. Confidential"".
Fans should also note a small, but distinctive part played by a then almost-unknown John Candy.

885175,5,6304435886,"""The Silent Partner"" is one of those rare films I have enjoyed watching over and over again. Every clever detail adds to the suspense and enjoyment of this truly under-rated film.  Elliot Gould is excellent in his portrayal of bank teller Miles Cullen.  The viewer actually finds himself rooting for Cullen, who is not only a thief, but is stealing from his own employer! And Christopher Plummer is deliciously wicked as Cullen's twisted, off-centered ""Partner"", who will do anything to settle the score. The scene where he talks to Cullen through the mail slot is worth the price of admission alone...",998352000,6,602,4.9504950495049505
885176,5,6304435886,"The Silent Partner is a  suspenseful, well done thriller with some  interesting twists and turns. Guaranteed to hold the attention of the  viewer throughout. Very original.

885177,5,6304435886,"If you're in the mood for a classy, tense thriller, The Silent Partner is for you. Curiously, I remember reading negative reviews of this movie when it first came out so it more or less bombed, now it's considered almost a  classic and one of the better films of the seventies.  Shows you how  gullible audiences are! But I've always loved it. If you want to see  Christopher Plummer in a great heavy role, you won't be disappointed,  Susannah York is a marvelous actress and genuinely beautiful, but it's  Elliott Gould who rules in this performance.  He's so understated and  subtle (but with the Gould wit and charm intact.) He starts out as this  nerdy guy, but with the notion that money and brains are indeed a powerful  aphrodisiac, he very gradually becomes almost sexually magnetic. But it's  all played out so subtly that you can't quite put your finger on it. You're  also sure to enjoy the plot twists and the surprise ending along with some  great dialogue.",960336000,7,970,4.668639053254438
885178,4,6304435886,"I first saw this film in 1979, and it was much better than what I was expecting. This is a good example of a ""B"" movie that far surpasses so many of the heavily hyped ""A"" productions.  Elliott  Gould and Christopher Plummer are outstanding in their roles, with solid  work from Susannah York and the then virtually unknown John Candy.  The  plot is compelling all the way through, the suspense never falters, and the  logic is ""airtight"", for people like myself who are annoyed with  thrillers that don't thrill, and plots that have more holes than the  pavement in downtown Belgrade.  Only a single scene of gruesome and  gratuitous violence detracts from what is a really fine film of its kind.",932601600,6,696,4.677685950413223

It is an excellent movie but apparently a somewhat overlooked  thriller, but as it's been a long rime since I've seen it  I'm in no position to offer a detailed review other than to say, if you like crime thrillers you' probably shouldn't overlook this one.  I feel, however, compelled to offer two comments:  First, to the characters who hated the cover; a question; Are you watching the film or the cover. Do you now fell better having contributed nothing to the discussion of the film. Second: After initially seeing the film I wondered about its female lead, Celine Lomez who seems to have evaporated from the planet. I was gratified to see that at least one reviewer shared my positive opinion of her instead of reviewing the cover.

It is an awesome little thriller of a type I call ""left turn thrillers"" -- because you think it's going to work out like a standard thriller, and, for about 40 minutes or so, it does -- and then takes a sudden left turn that you never would have expected to happen, and does an excellent job in that unexplored territory.

885327,2,6304435886,"The official review is full of errors, such as saying that Gould hides the money in advance of the robbery.  What he realizes is that something is possibly going to happen, go down, and only uses the safety deposit box later to hide what he puts in his lunchbox then briefcase.  Spoiler?  The Review is a silly spoiler!  He must have read another review first.  You know how a story turns mixed up as it travels from person to person.  Go ahead and watch the movie and come back and write your own Review.  Now, Christopher Plummer does his best, but sadly, many viewers now will be unable to overcome his Eidelweiss in The Sound of Music.  He himself has admitted his unfortunate typecasting.  And crossdressing him?  Gimmie a break.  He doesn't pass, as they say now.  The trope is a loser in 2015.  Gould does much better as an aquarium and fish loving honest sweet nerd, at the beginning.  Susannah York can act well and looks gorgeous.  Celine Lomez, where is she now?  What a doll.  Revenge is another man thing, in addition to rating a movie by the looks of the actresses.  Why would anyone do a real Spoiler by mentioning Revenge?!  Even the plastic box tells most of the Plot on the back.  And it has to point out John Candy in a bit part.  Who now would not notice him?  Gimmie a break.  He looks a visible 300 pounds plus, God rest his soul.  This movie now is a passable One Timer.  The end of Lomez is not for people with weak stomachs.

THE SILENT PARTNER: The robbery fuels endless speculation among the bank employees about what theyd do if the loot were theirs. I suppose Id use the money to buy myself another chance, Miles (Gould) reveals. And this is his strength: Reikle (Plummer) might be greedy, but hes only after the cash. To Miles, however, this tiny sum represents his future. And it serves to symbolize his self-image, too, providing him with confidence and daring he never knew he had. Miles has other advantageous traits as well: levelheaded logic, a talent for improvisation, and a history of being underestimated. When hes stalked and terrorized by Reikle, he knows he cant go to the police. But he can borrow Reikles techniques and turn the tables on him.

Although the film drags a bit once the red-herring romance is introduced (a sequence which also leads to the movies one black mark: a gratuitously gory, eye-averting scene involving a fish tank), it picks up again near the end, as the mens deadly chess game leads Miles to take one final desperate gamble to outwit the killerand secure a future.",1423267200,,1339,4.693617021276595

885331,4,6304435886,"Victor Von Trapp turns out to be a real jerk in this movie. Sound of Music jokes aside. Christopher Plummer is pretty great here as a crazed strong arm robber looking to get his stash back from the sorta hero of the movie Elliott Gould. Plummer goes all out in a performance where he murders, beats people of all genders, steals, has wild costume changes, has a thing for leather, and misuses a sauna in the worst possible way. Gould isn't too bad too. He does his best to get sympathy for a really unsympathetic character. He even does a good basset hound impersonation.

These movies really live and die by their actresses though and the actresses here all do a good job. Susanna York does a good job of keeping you guessing and the other actresses too. They might be as bad as the guys here but at least they make you worry about what's gonna happen to them.

The short of it is that it's a fun B-movie with good performers and that's never ever a bad thing.",1410393600,,961,4.333333333333333

Other reviewers have detailed the plot so suffice it to say that Christopher Plummer plays a part like I've never seen him play before or since. Vicious, brutal and cunning but not particularly intelligent.  Elliot Gould also plays against type (or at least the way he was typed back then) as a low-key bank teller whose waters run unexpectedly deep.  The movie does a slow build, ratcheting up the tension, and when the payoffs come they are unexpected and shocking.

A minor quibble over the packaging: the cover features one of the most misleading and wrong-headed designs I've ever seen.  The three head-cropped figures shown have zero to do with this story. It looks like it was meant to suggest something Tarantino-esque like 'Reservoir Dogs' which this movie in no way resembles.",1331251200,3,849,4.909090909090909
885418,5,6304435886,"5 Stars = Masterpiece

""Silent Partner"" is with out a doubt in my opinion, the best suspense thriller inspired by Alfred Hitchcock ever made. You'd think this was a Brian De Palma film, as it has the same greatness of his three suspense thrillers, ""Blow Out,"" ""Dressed to Kill,"" & ""Body Double,"" but this film was released in 1978, a full two years before ""Blow Out!"" It was directed by Canadian director, Daryl Duke, whose only real claim to fame was directing the excellent mini-series, ""The Thorn Birds.""

""Silent Partner"" is set in Toronto, at a bank in a huge mall. Vault teller, Miles Cullen (Elliot Gould), reads a carbon copy of a bank deposit slip that has written on it; ""The thing in my pocket is a gun. Give me all the cash."" He puzzles over this a while, then finally learns that career criminal, Harry Reikle (Christopher Plummer), dressed as Santa Clause, is planning on robbing the bank. He learns this by how Harry prints his capital G's, with the word ""Give,"" as Harry is collecting donations as Santa & has a sign written with ""Give"" on it, & Miles puts it all together. What transpires is the perfect game of chess, cat & mouse, as Miles anticipates the robbery, & figures out how to use the robber as a patsy to steal the money himself. What Miles does not anticipate, is the criminally psychotic lunatic that Harry is, & he wants his money back! What follows is a steel tightrope, as tense as suspension bridge wire, as Miles plays a dangerous game of wits with Harry, who finds out where Miles lives.

The direction & pacing of this film is spectacular! Daryl Duke really knows how to make a white knuckled, clench your teeth suspense thriller. I'm very surprised that this relatively unknown director did not become well known like Brian De Palma, as there is so much similarities between the two's directing style.

The cast was perfect, Elliot Gould & Christopher Plummer make for a legendary antagonist & protagonist. Miles & Harry parts are perfectly written. Miles, who everyone underestimates, & no one really knows much about him. Elliot Gould makes this character come to life with a greatly intelligent performance, you really get swept along. Harry, who is one of the coldest villains in cinema history! You really got to give Christopher Plummer applause for his great maniacal performance! The supporting cast is excellent to! Susannah York, as the bank operations manager, who is Miles love interest, but is entangled in an affair with the married bank manager, & may suspect Miles has the money later in the film. Their relationship, twists & turns, & fits perfectly in the movie. A very young & much slimmer John Candy has a small part! The bedazzling beautiful Celine Lomez, as Miles other love interest, is superbly infatuating! This is the only film I can remember seeing her in, but she certainly leaves an impression!

""Silent Partner"" is just about the perfect film! Maybe the best film you've never seen? At least in the suspense thriller genre. I really can not complain about a thing in this film, & wait until you see the ending!

885419,1,6304435886,"I gave this movie one star, which is one more than it deserves.  Silent Partner was billed as a tense thriller.  The only tension I felt was wondering how much longer it would go on.  The thrill came when it finally ended.  The actors moved as if they were zombies on Prozac, and Elliot Gould delivered his lines in a flat monotone that was a good substitute for Ambien.  Interspersed with this dullness were a few scenes of graphic and shocking violence that, because they did not fit the overall ho-hum tone of the movie, were gratuitous.

In addition to a debatably-necessary Doobie Brothers farewell/reunion concert, I also caught this amazing 1978 Canadian surprisingly tough heist/thriller.  Elliot Gould plays a bit against type as Miles, a shy fish-collecting bank teller who stumbles onto a scheme to rob the bank and ends up robbing it himself during the heist, with the unwitting patsy, played by Mr. Edelweiss himself -- Christopher Plummer, getting away and plotting to collect the money from Miles.  The plot has a very twisty assured path that frequently surprises and occasionally truly shocks.  It's the kind of movie that doesn't seem to get made anymore, one with great performances, a labrynthian plot that isn't stuck on its own cleverness and a refreshingly pedestrian amount of stolen dough.  I'd've given this baby five big ol' stars were it not for the somewhat-forced love angle between Miles and coworker Julie (Susannah York,) but I truly believe that this is one of the best thrillers ever made, and as many people have pointed out, it contains a bit of graphic violence (which, incidentally was purloined by a half-dozen late 70's/early 80's slasher flicks) that makes even the most hardened gore hounds either wince or give out a wide-eyed thumbs up.  Toss in a non-comedic role by John Candy, a solid soundtrack and an inspiringly-low number of Canadian ""eh's"" (only two,) there's enough to keep you riveted to the end.",1267142400,6,1609,5.075757575757576

885468,5,6304435886,"I remember seeing this movie back in 1980 on HBO and was so surprised that I had not recalled seeing it on the theatre marquee, or in fact never even heard anything about it.

This movie is probably one of the most underrated, under publicized and best movies one could possibly stumble upon.

The Silent Partner has it all, suspense, intrigue and drama all wrapped up in a cast of well thought out players ranging from a sociopathic murderer, to a thoughtful opportunistic bank teller who turns the tables on his tormentor time after time.

Elliot Gould plays reserved bank teller Miles Cullen who turns the tables on would be bank robber Harry Reikle played by Christopher Plummer. The movie begins with Cullen finding a discarded deposit slip on which a hold-up note has been written but for some reason has not been given to the teller to complete the robbery. Cullen decides to keep the theft note for some reason and begins ponderring on it. One day at one of his breaks Cullen notices a mall Santa ringing his bell collecting donations for the poor. What grabs Cullens attention is the lettering on Santa's sign matches the stick-up note that he had previously found. Putting two and two together Cullen decides that this is the would be robber and that he is in fact casing the bank and will be back to finish the job. What follows then is a masterful job of timing on Cullens part whereby he figures out when the Santa-robber will attempt the robbery and takes a very large deposit and actually pockets it for himself. When the robbery happens Cullen gives the Santa clad Reikle only a fraction of the actual deposit and ends up blaming Reikle for boosting the entire deposit.

What then follows is a very serious cat and mouse game being played between Reikle and Cullen, with the cat and the mouse changing roles as the movie progresses. Reikle is a very dangerous man bent on revenge, but we also find out Cullen is nobody to play games with as well.

The story builds to a suspensful climax and an ending that I won't give away but will close the story with no doubts.

As much as I love this flick I cannot for the life of me wonder what in the world is going on with the cover art for the DVD. Apparently whoever did the cover artwork never saw this movie before and just slapped this together.

If you enjoy grown-up, suspensful movies that you will watch time and time again, by all means buy this cheap DVD. You won't be dissapointed.",1186617600,5,2452,4.521444695259594
885469,4,6304435886,"I totally forgot about this thriller until a friend reminded me about it.  I saw it back when it first came out and then again on tv.  It kept me on the edge of my seat then and still does today.  I just bought the DVD (nothing new was added).  This is an excellent suspense thriller.  Briefly, Plummer plays a bank robber that discovers more money was missing from the bank than he got.  He knew right away that the bank teller (Elliot Gould) had something to do with the rest of the money and he tries immediately to get it.  The plot is full of twists and turns and keeps you in suspense the whole length of the film.  There was something for every movie lover---fright, suspense, romance and slight comedy.  The comedy was courtesy of a character played by a young John Candy!  When Plummer says, ""One night when you come home you'll find me inside waiting and that will be the night you'll wish you'd never been born,"" scares the pants off of you.  The ""aquarium"" scene was a bit too much for me to bear, as I am an animal lover (yeah, I felt worse for the fish), but very, very suspenseful!",1183939200,3,1096,4.271844660194175
885470,5,6304435886,"When this movie came out, I'd seen Siskel and Ebert's ""At The Movies"" review (the first show of its kind) and both enthusiastically endorsed it. I had a limited, but definite appreciation for Elliott Gould. So I took it in. Suspenseful, clever, and well conceived plot and script with enough mental and physical terror to keep you on your toes  is performed by a very capable cast. I loved it. It made me even more a Gould fan, and Christopher Plummer is perfect as the angried, sadistic bank robber. Some of the content is very dated. The mall design reminded me of the passe architecual designs of the 70s. And the constant bubbling between bankers after the robbery about how they'd fullfill their many fantasies if they had $50 thousand like the bank robber made away with. Kind of equal to ""Austin Powers'"" Dr. Evil threatening to destroy the world unless he receives $1 million! Those minor points aside, this is a legitimate thriller that actually won Canada's best picture award that year. A great cat and mouse game of wits that is pleasing to your brain as it keeps you intrigued from start to finish. Watch for a very young Canadian actor named John Candy, right about the period of his hugely successful ""SCTV"" late night comedy series. Also, the DVD reproduction is excellent in it's remastering.

885471,4,6304435886,"And the award for most misleading DVD cover of the year goes to Lions Gate for The Silent Partner, which scales new heights of dishonesty in its attempts to sell this very smart 1978 Canadian thriller as a Reservoir Dogs heist movie with its image of three black-suited robbers, smoking gun in hand, striding across a US hundred dollar bill, while below even the still of a huge open bank vault is from a completely different movie. By contrast, the film is set in a small shopping mall branch of a Toronto bank which Christopher Plummer's very unpleasant solo bank robber knocks off disguised as Santa Claus only to find that Elliott Gould's clued-in bank teller has pulled a fast one on him and kept $48,000 of the $50,000 haul himself, cuing an increasingly nasty game of cat and mouse where it turns out that the much underestimated Gould's cunning is more than a match for Plummer's cruelty as the stakes constantly rise. Half victim, half apprentice, Gould's boringly inconspicuous everyman finds himself surprisingly adept at crime, taking his lead from Plummer's tactics and excelling at using them against him, and not showing much more concern over any victims that fall violently by the wayside than his tormenter/inadvertent teacher. The nastiness is there but never overplayed in Curtis Hanson's smart screenplay and Daryl Duke's confident direction avoids showing off at the expense of the story. Ingeniously gripping stuff, its well worth checking out - but perhaps not recommended for any tropical fish lovers.

885530,5,6304435886,"Mild-mannered Miles Cullen (Elliot Gould) gloms on to a robbery in its formative stages at the bank where he works as a teller.  He fetches his old ""Superman"" lunch box and ingeniously foils the would-be robber, who still manages to escape while Miles pockets the money for himself.

With his unexpected boldness, Miles wins a temporary celebrity status, and a newfound sex appeal to use on his love-interest, Julie (played by Susannah York.)  Unfortunately, Miles must come down to earth when he realizes that he has attracted another admirer, the psychopathic robber Harry Reikle, who is thoroughly enraged by the fact that Miles has thwarted him.

Elliot Gould is terrific as the nerdish but canny Miles, playing him with an abundance of smirks.  Susannah York sparkles as the perky professional Julie, who shares Miles' despair over a boringly repetitious existence.

But Christopher Plummer is the scene-stealer as the viciously jealous Reikle, a particularly nasty combination of derangement, sexual kinkiness, and cunning.

An added bonus is the appearance of Celine Lomez as the ravishingly beautiful Elaine, who lavishes her attentions on Miles before meeting an untimely end.  Lomez could have been a star if she had showed up a couple decades later, when Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek, and Penelope Cruz escorted ""Latino chic"" into the movies.  See if Celine Lomez doesn't make your heart flip-flop.

Altogether, ""Silent Partner"" is a first-rate chiller in the Hitchcock vein.  It's peculiar, cross-dressed kinkiness preceded Brian De Palma's ""Dressed to Kill"" by a few years, and IMHO, ""Silent Partner"" is a better film than ""Dressed to Kill"".

""Silent Partner"" was shot entirely in Toronto, Canada, and features a sweet film score by that city's native jazzman, Oscar Peterson.

Five stars.",1178064000,7,1801,5.277192982456141
885531,4,6304435886,"This odd little movie -- about a bank manager who figures out a way to profit from a robbery -- kept surprising me.

I rented it after reading a capsule review and as early as the opening credits was startled to see that it has a score by jazz pro Oscar Peterson, and it's based on a script by Curtis Hanson, who would later adapt ""L.A. Confidential.""

It's obvious Hanson had the chops early on because ""The Silent Partner"" is an extremely well done, satisfyingly complex little thriller that was years ahead of its time. It has its share of jolting shifts in tone and approach, and its low-budget Canadian roots are pretty blatant, but that works to the advantage of the film; it makes viewers underestimate the movie in much the same way that characters underestimate the protagonist.

Elliott Gould's awkward bank manager figures out that his branch is about to be held up so he stashes $48,000 beforehand for himself. The psychotic robber, played by Christopher Plummer (with a cold, preening style that reminded me of Kevin Spacey back when Kevin Spacey was Kevin Spacey), realizes he's been shafted and comes after the money. In a big way.

It's kind of disconcerting to see Gould, in the years not long after ""California Split"" and ""The Long Goodbye,"" play such an unapologetic, low-key dork -- unimpressing women with his love of tropical fish and propping chairs against his front door -- but the story basically requires it.

Plummer is great as the made-up, bad jewelry-wearing villain whose extreme methods almost (*almost*) take the movie places it shouldn't go. And Celine Lomez, who plays one of Gould's two love interests, is so smoking hot I almost couldn't believe it; she's also a solid enough actor to put across her character's complicated loyalties.

With its mix of nerdiness and unexpected complexity, ""The Silent Partner"" reminds me of some flawed-but-likeable, lesser-known films written by John Patrick Shanley (""The January Man"" specifically) and William Goldman (""No Way to Treat a Lady"") but it succeeds where those movies eventually break down: in the plotting.

I'm not sure why the DVD's distributors felt they had to market this as a ""Reservoir Dogs""-type movie (the cover art depicts armed, black-suited robbers who never actually appear in the film trodding across an American $100 Benjamin, despite that all the currency shown in the film in Canadian), but ""The Silent Partner"" does share ""Dogs""'s infectious love of cinema and its startling, twisty, relentless intelligence.",1177632000,6,2513,5.0264423076923075

I first watched this film in 1978 on a double bill.  This film received no publicity and suffered from the worst distribution of any film... EVER! Garth Drabinsky (Cineplex Odeon) produced this film with massive help from the Canadian Film Board. This film was a complete Canadian production and the major distributers bought it on the cheap for US distribution.  The problem was that this film is probably one of the top 20 films made in the glorious 1970's.  Easily on a level with ""3 Days of the Condor"".

You truly had to be ""in the know"" to see this movie... however, it is finally released in DVD. Now you can see one of the greatest ""little"" movies of all time. Tight script, well acted, and directed beautifully; however, this film was done on a small budget and it shows in the film stock used.  Don't let this stop you from seeing a true classic from the 70's.

PS... Don't read any of the reviews that tell you anything about the plot... enjoy it for the first time with fresh eyes and ""spoiler"" free.",1177027200,7,1040,4.470899470899471
885534,5,6304435886,"I saw this so-called ""B"" movie when it was released in 1978 and, prior to buying the DVD, I seemed to remember being floored at how good it was then. I puchased it, unsure if it would stand up to the somewhat towering impression it had on me some 30 years ago. I was both somewhat shocked and relieved to find it as good, or even better, than I remembered! Air-tight script with a good number of twists. Holds up well in denoument. I can only wonder how this treasure fell through the cracks - the only thing bad about this movie must have been the distribution.

Everyone here is very good and this is one of Christopher Plummer's most memorable performances.

The DVD transfer on this disc is less than stellar, but still very good. The colors and contrast are fine, but (uncharacteristically, in respect to more recent DVD re-releases), the resolutuion is a bit soft, but, not fatally so. There's only one disc in the clam-shell box, it is anamorphic 1.85 to 1, and the run time is stated as 101 minutes. Some have claimed the DVD has been cut for some of its violence, but, I'm pretty sure I can tell you (and perhaps warn you) it has not. The sound is unexceptional, but intelligible, mono. Except for a single choice of subtitles (Spanish), there are zero extras. As it is, for myself, I'm more than pleased to finally have an un-cut, properly-framed, anamorphic, DVD version of this far-too-long, unavailable movie. Beg, borrow or..uh,..'steal' this movie.

The Silent Partner is a deft mixtue of suspense and humor, with enough twists to keep one guessing until the very end. I used to own it on LaserDisc, and the film was grainy and the colors rather faded. I am pleased to report that the film has aged well, and the colors on this dvd are far richer than they were on Laser or HBO. The grain is still there, but it is not a distraction. If you like suspense films and have not seen his movie, you owe it to yourself to see it.

One last word: I wish Amazon would not allow reviews for a product prior to its release. There are a number of reviews here that were written long before the DVD release ( April 3).

This is a very good film but it doesn't have the viceral impact that it did when I was 16 years old.  Elliott Gould is quite good as the seemingly nebbishy bankteller who doublecrosses Christopher Plummer's sadistic bankrobber.  That said there are not enough scenes between these adveraries, the juiciest parts of the film.  A matter of fact there are not enough scenes with Plummer.  I'd be surprised if Plummer logs at least 10 minutes of screen time here.  The script most certainly has it's share of interesting cat-and-mouse twists but there are the occasional lulls.
