2559290,4,B000FBFYX2,"This was an excellent product, first of all; however as a long time fan and follower of the Baltimore Orioles, I have a few suggestions.  The highlights were too short, there could have been many more.  More features with the players and other tidbits (for instance, a nice feature on Earl Weaver?), are in order.  Earl was a veritable highlight reel himself, and his numerous confrontations with umpires and Jim Palmer, plus his tomato patch at Memorial Stadium make for great copy and interest for those of us who loved him.  I suggest that more of the historical context of the 1966 Series be made as well.  All in all, a fine introductory piece for the casual fan; but hardly a fulfilling project for the long-time, hard core O's lover like myself.  Perhaps an update in the future could flesh this out a bit more--and increase the price too.  Now--when do we get something to honor the BALTIMORE Colts hmm??",1211500800,2,912,4.6625
2559291,5,B000FBFYX2,"As a fan of the Baltimore Orioles, we really haven't had much to cheer about in the last ten years.

It's nice that MLB put the World Series Films from all three Orioles championships on one DVD.

Each film runs about 40 minutes long with highlights from each game.

1966 - The Orioles shock the world and beat the favored LA Dodgers behind the masterful pitching of Jim Palmer, Wally Bunker, and Dave McNally.  Homeruns from Paul Blair, and Brooks and Frank Robinson helped too.

1970 - Possibly the best team in Birds history.  McNally, Palmer, and Mike Cuellar provide the pitching.  Boog Powell and the Robinsons provide the power to beat the mighty Big Red Machine with Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, and Tony Perez.

1983 - The last hurrah.  The Birds have a brilliant mix of veterans like Rick Dempsey and Jim Palmer, and young players Eddie Murray and Cal Ripken Jr. to beat the Philadelphia Phillies in five.

Next year will be 25 long years since the last championship.

As for the MLB logo at the top of the screen mentioned by the other reviewer.  I agree, it's completely unnecessary, but after like five minutes, you really don't notice it.

Don't let that prevent you from two hours of Baltimore Orioles glory.",1197417600,13,1219,4.640186915887851
2559292,2,B000FBFYX2,"I was thrilled when I first read that MLB Productions was finally issuing a DVD version of highlights of the Baltimore Orioles' three World Series victories.  I already owned the VHS versions, one of which (the 1970 World Series) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization (watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film).  Finally, I could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 World Series.

Much to my dismay, the MLB logo is permanently, and obtrusively, displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs.  What's that all about?  Does MLB Productions think I'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills?  Thank goodness I don't own a plasma TV or I'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years!

Sound and picture quality are okay otherwise.  But....that logo is really annoying.",1162857600,12,895,4.803921568627451

2559384,4,B000FBFYX2,"It's great to see the Orioles in the games which ultimately led to their three world series titles. However keep in mind this DVD is a highlight reel for each of the series in 66, 70 and 83. So to be clear you don't get to see the complete games for each series. Also as it's been said in another review,  for each game you do have the MLB logo somewhere on the screen during each series highlight.",1415836800,3,398,4.102564102564102

8120141,5,B000FBFYX2,"This DVD set got me through the rotten years. I got this as a promotional copy about 7-8 years ago when I was a writer for the Orioles page of a sports opinion news site. I had forgotten about it until Amazon put it in the 'recommended for me' section. Then I remembered how much I needed this DVD set during those bad years to remind me that my team wasn't always the most hapless franchise in sports.

I watched this in parts at various times during the 14 year dry spell of misery to remind me what the Orioles franchise was capable of and had accomplished. It was kind of like looking at a picture of your pretty wife while serving a 14 year prison sentence. You're miserable, but you hold those memories of how good it used to be, and hold that you could feel that again when you get out.

Then the prison sentence ends and Buck Showalter takes your team to the playoffs and everything feels like it did in 66, 79, and 83 again.",1428192000,2,933,4.206703910614525
