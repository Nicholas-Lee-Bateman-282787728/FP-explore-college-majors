1205748,3,B00000FAQP,"This is a review for THE AMBASSADOR'S DAUGHTER (1956)directed and written by Norman Krasna. Olivia de Haviland in a 1956 romcom ?  Well, why not?  She was good in practically everything I've seen her in and if you've ever watched her carry the Sonny Tufts burdened wartime bomb, GOVERNMENT GIRL, you can believe that she'd do justice to herself and her character in this trifle.

The story concerns Joan Fisk, daughter of the American ambassador to France, who is bored showing Americans the well-known French sights and wants to prove to her father that no all GIs are wolves.  She accepts a date with Sgt. Danny Sullivan, played by John Forsythe, and immediately falls for him.
The rest of this movie concerns rather silly attempts to conceal the relationship from her father and possibly everyone else. With John Forsythe, Tommy Noonan, MYrna Loy, Adolph Menjou, Edward Arnold.

By the way, the picure quality on the copy that I saw was certainly okay, pretty fair, in fact.
I give THE AMBASSADOR'S DAUGHTER Three Stars.",1285027200,3,1023,4.890173410404624
1205749,5,B00000FAQP,"I have not seen this movie in years, but it is just as good as I remembered it. I really enjoyed seeing it again.",1280880000,,113,3.75
1205750,1,B00000FAQP,"I saw this movie on TV and really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the DVD recording that they used.  You would get better quality if you just recorded the movie off the TV.  It is such a shame!!!",1280448000,,240,4.409090909090909
1205751,1,B00000FAQP,Very disappointing copy of this film.  I saw it on TCM as well and it was lovely copy they ran.  There must be a way that Amazon ought to be held responsible for not rating the quality of these films when they are as bad as pirated versions.,1224460800,8,241,4.0
1205752,1,B00000FAQP,"This is the 1956 comedy with Edward Arnold, John Forsythe, Myrna Loy, Olivia De Haveland, and Tommy Noonan.  The script is embarrassingly bad.  There are no laughs.  The only highlight is the fashion designed by Dior.  An exception even to that, however, is the hat worn by Myrna Loy in the early scenes of the film.  It looks as though an arrow was stuck in it.  For entertainment on any level, this is close to zero.  Even the finest actors can't do much with writing of this sort.",1177804800,5,483,4.420454545454546
1205836,2,B00000FAQP,"I've tried four separate times to get a good copy of this wonderful movie, but each version has been awful.  The sound is scratchy and not very clear, the film is grainy, and it ""skipped"" in places.  How is it that the movie plays beautifully on TV, but the DVD version is bad?",1396569600,2,277,4.2075471698113205
1205837,4,B00000FAQP,"I have one copy of this in V H S, good cast two beautiful women Olivia de Havilland  & Mirna Loy,
 they  make the film good but, the best is the Swan Lake Ballet, this one of my favorites.",1376352000,,188,3.769230769230769
1205838,4,B00000FAQP,"Again, like many, I saw it on TCM and enjoyed it. Unlike many, I find one I like we like to buy it for our heritage collection. Already trained my kids, and ma working on my grandkids. Gotta keep the third generation in love with classics.",1370476800,2,239,4.217391304347826
1205839,1,B00000FAQP,"I can't believe Amazon is selling such a poor quality product.  I tried to watch this DVD (I really like the movie which is why I purchased the DVD) and the quality is so poor it's impossible to watch.  It's blurry, the sound is poor, there are lines in the video.  It's almost as though it was copied from a poor quality upload on the internet.  Shame on Amazon!  And, since I was unable to watch it right away, it's too late to return it.  Aw well, live and learn.",1347235200,6,466,4.122222222222222
1205840,5,B00000FAQP,"Very good cast. Who doesn't like Olivia DeHaviland or Myrna Loy? John Forsythe is a little stiff in the role, but maybe that's due to the character he plays.",1336089600,,157,4.448275862068965
1205841,3,B00000FAQP,"I had purchased a DVD of Ambasador's Daughter some months ago on DVD.  I throughly enjoyed the romantic comedy... both the acting and fashions.... BUT the movie which was filmed in wide-screen was squeezed into a tv frame.  The cars were foreshortened, and scenery somewhat wierd.  I searched and found the VHS tape with Amazon hopefully to replace the DVD.  Unfortunately the tape was no better than the DVD.  It would have been better is someone whould have taken the time and made the effort to develop a print closer to the original.",1324598400,2,537,4.731182795698925
1205842,5,B00000FAQP,"I saw this movie when it first came out and enjoyed it so much that I went to see it again a few weeks later.  Granted it is a light comedy but , for me, very entertaining.  Last night I saw it again on TCM and really enjoyed seeing it again.  Unfortunately several other reviews commented on the bad DVD so I won't be ordering it from Amazon.com.  Too bad. Adolphe Menjou mistaken for a dirty old man and his wife's attempt to explain it away are hilarious.",1307318400,,458,4.170454545454546
1205843,1,B00000FAQP,i received this movie as a gift and was excited about seeing it. i was terribly disappointed in the quality of video. this is nothing but a horribly made copy. how can Amazon sell these anyway. BUYER BEWARE!!!,1298419200,,209,4.526315789473684
1205844,3,B00000FAQP,THE MOVIE IS A GOOD COMEDY. MY ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE DVD WAS NOT SHOWING A VERY CLEAR PICTURE. SINCE I AM A COLLECTOR OF MOVIES DATING 80% 1930-1950 I WOULD HAVE LIKED A GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURE.,1289952000,,197,4.076923076923077
1205845,5,B00000FAQP,"Although I had to return the DVD, the prompt credit and service was excellent.  I would not hesitate in using them again.",1288310400,,121,4.5
7907434,1,B00000FAQP,The ending is missing and the quality is terrible for a recent movie like this. I would expect quality like this for a movie from the Silent Era.,1512172800,,145,4.214285714285714
7907435,1,B00000FAQP,"Listen to what others have said...this is a very bad copy or bootleg of a lovely movie.
Not watchable due to print quality, screen size, etc.
Wait and watch it on TCM.",1504137600,,167,4.25
7907436,3,B00000FAQP,"Cute movie, but very bad quality (picture, sound, etc.)... like someone else said, it's like it was taped off of the TV! I am glad I own it on DVD, but wish it had been transferred better.",1502496000,,188,4.108108108108108
7907437,1,B00000FAQP,"Bought this 2017 version on spec, figured it couldn't be worse than the earlier abomination. Well, it might be better but it's hard to say how. Looks in fact like the older one re-released, maybe slightly cleaned up but still full screen so half the time half the actors in a scene are off camera. And it's dirty, full of specks and scratches. TCM still has the only decent version. Fuhgeddaboudit.",1498435200,,398,4.619718309859155

7907439,1,B00000FAQP,Very poor dvd.  Picture was blurry. I have seen movie on tv and this dvd did not finish the ending.  Extremely bad dvd.  Not worth even giving away.,1453420800,,148,4.214285714285714

7907441,2,B00000FAQP,"I saw this movie recently on TCM, and decided to buy it. The copy that I received had a number of bad spots and to top it off the end of the movie was not the wedding scene, they had cut the movie early",1434585600,2,202,3.6136363636363638
7907442,1,B00000FAQP,VHS copy and a bad one at that,1422921600,,30,2.875
