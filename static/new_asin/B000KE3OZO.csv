2688536,5,B000KE3OZO,"This was one of those quirky little shows set in a law firm.  It uses its cases to set the mood for each episode but also relies on the peccadillos of its main characters to anchor the show.  We have the wattle man, the Barbie doll, the nose noise man; even the unisex bathroom almost becomes a character.

Ally had once dated one of the other lawyers who works at the firm with his current wife which sets the mood for a lot of sexual tension.  Ally is supposedly still in love with him though she manages to fall in love with most other hunky men who walk through her door.

As we move through the subsequent seasons we follow the loves and losses of most all of the Firms oddball ensemble cast.  I can understand how the feminist movement pointed to this series with disdain.  Ally was not an ""I can do"" female.  In fact she was kind of an ""I'm falling apart"" type of gal.  Sort of like me.  Maybe that's why I'm so fascinated by this series.

It's too bad the music licensing issue keep this funny show out of the market for so long.  There is a large current group of the purchasing public who will probably not buy this series because it's now just too old. I'm giving the same review to each year of the series because they're pretty much alike with interchangeable boyfriends and co-workers - but they're all good.....bg",1264636800,2,1328,4.331983805668016
2688537,4,B000KE3OZO,"the only problem i had with this dvd is that it only plays on a region free dvd play, i don't understand why an american series like this would only be recorded on a different region.  thank you",1252713600,,194,4.105263157894737
2688538,5,B000KE3OZO,"The menus and navigating is a little awkward, but its the best we've got so I can't complain:  I'm thrilled to see Ally again just as the episodes aired in good quality and with music in tact.

Don't worry if you don't have a Region 2 DVD Player:  You can Use VLC Player to watch any Region DVDs on a PC or Mac set to any region.  Google:  VLC Media Player software, its a free download.

****UPDATE 11/2011:
It seems Amazon has once again combined many reviews on various formats of this DVD into one.  The above review I did a few years ago was for the Region 2 version of Ally which was the only Ally McBeal Season 2 DVD that contained the original music.  This new version of the DVD that Amazon has put my review on is for the new Region 1 US Canada version that finally has the original music.",1218499200,3,799,4.142857142857143

2688562,5,B000KE3OZO,"I watched every episode of Ally from beginning to end when it was on TV. When it came down to actually purchasing past episodes I chose to stop with the second season for one simple reason. When it got to the third season and beyond IT GOT STUPID. This seemed to be a continuing thing with David E. Kelley as Boston Public started good and also became stupid. The second season of Ally McBeal had it's negative traits. For example this was the season that had the famous ""Ally Kissed Billy"" episode that critics and fans complained had been dragged out way too long. It did have it's crazy moments like John Cage and his High Bar dismount from the toilet stall. Probably the funnier moments was with John and his pet frog. I only wished that they had written a serious romance between John Cage and Nelle Porter into the show.",1402704000,,826,4.440789473684211
2688563,5,B000KE3OZO,this show is great. one of the best things to come from the  90's. has great romance and humor. ive looked on other sites and amazon is the only one who sales it for cheap. other sites have it for over 20 to 40 bucks. buy this dvd now now now now now!,1399420800,,251,3.7358490566037736

2688568,5,B000KE3OZO,"I gave this series five stars because it gives me great background while I do other things.  I watched the series off and on when it was originally broadcast but binge watching is definitely much better.  I play it on weekends because I am not into sports and Verizon has hundreds of channels of nil or next to nil.  Hope Amazon gets it's TV streaming setbox out soon.  I will be one of the first buyers.

This review is about season one and one half of season two but I am pretty sure it applies to the rest of the episodes also.",1389398400,,530,4.1568627450980395

2688571,4,B000KE3OZO,"I never watched the TV show when it originally aired in the late 1990's.  At the time it was considered a bit edgy in content, but compared to modern TV show's it's mild.  I have enjoyed season 1 and 2.  I am glad that Amazon has offered this as PRIME.  The show is funny and witty; and the risky content is pale in comparison from today's programming.",1388275200,,352,4.208955223880597

2688578,5,B000KE3OZO,just love to watch it.  some great laughs.  One episode has Barry White performing.  It's worth it just to see this one where he sings and they all do the famous Cage dance.,1382227200,,173,4.181818181818182

2688581,2,B000KE3OZO,"Season one was kind of cute and quirky. The characters were off-beat and charming.  Season two went ""dark"" and turned out to unlikeable.  However, the mix of 50's-60's music was well integrated into the story line. This was, in its own way, an interesting series as a musical.",1379548800,,276,4.729166666666667

2688587,5,B000KE3OZO,"Easy to see how Season 2 won the Emmy for best Outstanding Comedy Series.  Several laugh out loud episodes as well as some that will touch your heart.  (If you watched all of Season 1, ""Happy Trails"" is a winner in Season 2.)",1375660800,2,225,4.209302325581396

2688590,1,B000KE3OZO,"If you enjoy bad musicals, this may be the sitcom/dramedy for you. The loud vocals are pervasive, even during much of the characters' conversations. The only reason I can think of that this howling woman screeches throughout a wittily written series is that she is member of the cast or crew's relative. While the choice of songs is generally appropriate, for me the chosen vocalist ruins otherwise fondly remembered music and the volume of her shrieking often drowns out the clever dialogue. The ""Vonda whatever her name is"" show would be a more honest title.",1368489600,2,560,4.905263157894737

2688598,5,B000KE3OZO,"Only got 1 episode, not the whole season, largely due to Portia de Rossi (that her name?) being dressed as she calls it as a flight attendant (tight skirt, shirt and tie) which is a very hot look on someone so feminine.

The only thing I didn't like was the fact that when I saw this as a first run series, I missed this particular year of viewing and never knew what had happened to one of the major characters.  I thought one thing, but something else happened and I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who wants to watch a truly original series.  But be prepared for a shock.",1334620800,,507,4.25
2688606,4,B000KE3OZO,"Ally McBeal was a romance comedy that took on some very controversial topics, even in today's society. Every episode builds on the last storyline between characters and new subject matter from new clients. There are always funny/sad events between the main characters, with some morality questions coming to my mind, which makes me consider other points of view than just my own.

This is possibly the best season of Ally McBeal- Tracey Ullman is a gas as Dr. Tracy and Lucy Lui is awesome as Ling (Soft L). It also includes the hilarious bathroom brawl (Civil Wars) between Ally and Georgia and Nelle and Ling- I still laugh every time Elaine walks in with her video camera and Ally shrieks ""Nelle Started It! Georgia and I were have a fight by ourselves and You turned it into a Brawl!""",1469836800,,631,4.3559322033898304
