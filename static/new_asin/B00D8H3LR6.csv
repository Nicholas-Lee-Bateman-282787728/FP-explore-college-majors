5777273,5,B00D8H3LR6,"My daughter and I got hooked on this series this year by just flipping through the channels. Word of caution - this is a grown-up plot line. It deals with sex, drugs, abandonment, and relationships. The cast is great and the writing is amazing.",1388880000,9,244,4.568181818181818
5777274,5,B00D8H3LR6,I fell in love with this show after I watched 1 Episode. It reminds me a bit of an old MTV show called Undressed except its in High School instead of college.,1387324800,5,158,3.96875

5777278,4,B00D8H3LR6,"I love this show, but I wasn't as happy with the dvds. Keep in mind that the dvds are censored. All swear words deemed too racy for teens have been literally *BLEEP*ed out. I find this rather funny with the range of topics this show covers and as the ""kids"" are quite sexually active throughout the show. It seems a bit ridiculous to allow kids to watch what are essentially children having sex on screen, but then to decide that kids watching this show will be too sensitive to hear swear words. Another issue is there are no Subtitle options, nor is there Closed Captioning available. Anyway, the show is pleasantly surprising and hilarious and the characters are endearing. I recommend this show to everyone I talk to! I just love it! So as far as the show itself I give 5 stars, but the dvds lose a star for censorship.",1465689600,2,823,4.456953642384106

5777299,4,B00D8H3LR6,"Amazing show, if you like it, I recommend the MTV series, 'Faking It'. This DVD set comes in brand new, and the picture quality is perfect. However, I ordered this product from a secondary seller named, 'themediaoutlet', who claimed 2-Day shipping in their description, but I received my copy in 11 days. Way un-cool. So my advice, and the only reason this is a 4 star review instead of 5, buy it from the official, 'Amazon.com' seller. Pay a little more money and get your copy in 4 days. You're welcome.",1436140800,,505,4.56043956043956

5777302,5,B00D8H3LR6,"First of all, I love this show. Reminds me so much of my high school days, boy drama and all. From the simple being the outcast nerd to the wanting one guy that keeps you secret, dating his best friend while still wanting the guy and so on, this show hits home for me.

Second of all. I'm a prime member now so I get everything freaky fast but when I bought this I wasn't and I still got it in 3 days. :O loved it. Also watched all three seasons in two days......Hahaha. either way great show, great seller. A++",1424736000,,511,4.0594059405940595

5777326,2,B00D8H3LR6,"When I received both of the DVD's of This one and Season 3 part1, my friend video taped my reaction when I was opening the boxes and you could hear a loose object rolling around. Yuppppp you guessed it a CD was flip flopping inside and scratched all over on the sensitive side. There is parts in the show where the screen goes green and also cuts out and you are still able to hear the voices but the image goes away. ALL IN ALL I LOVE THE SHOW AWKWARD WITH A 5 STAR ALL THE WAY, I would be more then happy to send you the video image since you can clearly hear the CD inside in case not properly secured. I work at a 5 star and 5 diamond hotel and its always busy and crazy trying to get to juggle my life with work life since I am always fully committed to my job. I don't always have time to do review's or anything like that because normally I am not one to complain since, working at a place like I do really changes your perspective on things but this time I was actually DISSAPOINTED when I received these. Poor packaging of securing the product could of been corrected but I assume poor packaging procedures could of caused the problem.",1398988800,2,1144,4.134529147982063
