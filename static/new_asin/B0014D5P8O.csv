Yes, I was a fan of the orginal tv series when I was little but Nick suprised me when they came out with the spin off of it. I actually enjoy this one more the old one, but that's just my style in cartoons. It starts off with this young teen name Speed who enters a racing school. He has a mysterious past and the only thing left behind from his parents with speed racer's red bandana and a car key that has the color of the M5. He has no idea who his parents are and the only thing he has is the urge for racing like speed racer. He is constantly harassed by X (who claims to be speed racer's son) and his friends. Though he will soon prove them all wrong on the race track when he shows off some amazing moves that only speed racer was capable of. Each episode he discovers that he is no ordinary orphen.
If you're a fan of speed racer or even any action show, then give this a try. I am already a big fan of it.",1209254400,3,1002,3.892682926829268

3129594,4,B0014D5P8O,"It's clear from the get-go that this show is geared more towards younger fans than how the original show was. Still, Speed Racer the Next Generation - The Beginning is a fun romp that fans of the original will enjoy as well as those new to the series.

Speed Racer the Next Generation - The Beginning tells the story of Speed, an orphan who gets to join an elite racing academy to learn how to be a great racer. There, he meets Conor and Lucy as well as X whom he later learns is his brother. Spritle from the old tv series is headmaster of the academy in this show. But, the evil Zile Zazic is the series protagonist who is trying to get his hands on the Mach 6. Things get pretty interesting in this barely over an hour animated film.

While it probably won't appeal to original Speed Racer fans, it will appeal to the younger set. Honestly, though, I enjoyed it very much.",1236038400,6,875,4.265060240963855

3129599,5,B0014D5P8O,"""Just watch me when I get on the track,"" Speed Racer tells the headmaster on his first day at the Racing Academy, where everyone's rather amused that he shares the name of the founder and major idol of the facility. So begins the journey of the animated ""Speed Racer: The Next Generation,"" which takes Speed -- unaware that he's actually the son of the legendary Speed Racer -- on a quest to find his missing father and get to know his brother, X, who's developed quite a following of his own.

Thankfully, there are a few friendly faces at the academy: the sensible Lucy, the quirky Conor and Chim-Chim the pesky, monkeylike robot. After a little trash-talkin' with the other students at the academy, the kids hit the track (where the visuals -- lush, bright and heavy on the oranges and blues like the original until now -- turn more photographic and three-dimensional and CG). Despite a technical mishap with the clunker car he was given, Speed makes an impression. X, determined to reflect the legacy of his father, is getting a mite bit jealous.

Lionsgate launches the new Friday-night Nickelodeon animated series with this sleek pilot film. Bringing the original series, which ran for just 52 episodes in 1967 and 1968, up to speed, the movie allows its main character to discover his true identity rather quickly. He and his new friends find the ""real"" Speed Racer's car, the Mach 5, in pieces at the junkyard, and the key that was left with young Speed at the orphanage powers up the grand old machine!

As is often the case, this update of a classic TV icon requires an upgrade. Much like the new ""Knight Rider"" movie turned the 2000 KITT model into the 3000, the Mach 6 is now the engine to beat in this show, after the resurrected Mach 5 takes an unexpected spill. But the academy's wealthy (and sinister!) investor, Zile Zazic, doesn't want Speed or anyone else to take the wheel of this technologically advanced Mach 6, amazingly powered without gasoline (a timely issue!). Add in a ""virtual"" racetrack, and you've got some turbo-speed new-millennium fun.

Kurt Csolak voices Speed (above right), while Robbie Sublett is X (left). Peter Fernandez, who voiced Speed and Racer X in the original and even wrote the lyrics for the original theme song, voices Spritle, headmaster of the academy and brother of the legendary Speed Racer (Fernandez does a cameo on the live-action flick, too). Included in the movie's writing crew is Jimmy Palmiotti, the mastermind behind ""Painkiller Jane"" and the sweetie-pie that I used to love to say hello to at comic cons through the latter '90s. (Listed as ""James Palmiotti"" here -- so serious, Jimmy???)

The DVD's extras include a featurette on the making of the TV show (Fernandez and others offer their thoughts), full bios of the characters at the Racing Academy, a trailer gallery and the ""Virtual Track Racing Game"" (using the arrow keys on your DVD remote). Previews include a glimpse of Marvel's new DVD take on the Avengers (also ""the next generation"") coming in August.",1210636800,2,3027,4.802303262955854
