2521335,5,B000EHSVC8,"Like others whose reviews I have read, I was addicted to this show while in high school. Every Thursaday at 10pm you would find me in front of the television awaiting the fatest hour in television. 20 years later, I couldn't figure out why the ""Great American Hero"" had been released and ""Hill Street"" hadn't been. When I finally saw it available for purchase, I jumped. But the questions of ""Does it hold up?"" ""Will that police car still spin in the opening of the show?"" Is Veronica Hamel still as hot as I remembered her?"" ""Was Renko funny, yet?""

The answers to all of these questions were an astounding YES! While you can't help but notice how out-dated some of the show really is (no cell-phones, no computers etc...), the writing still remains engrossing and the characters are still engaging. Season 2 should provide more of the same. Re-discovering a classic and enjoying it as much as you did 20 + years ago says that either it's as good as it really is or that I haven't matured and really need a life. Hopefully it's just that good.",1146182400,,1044,4.523809523809524
2521336,5,B000EHSVC8,"Watching the first season on DVD, I was surprised at how well this great show has withstood the test of time, Belker's epithets withstanding (""Hairball"", ""Dogbreath"", and all the variations of the two the writers could come up with).  The secret to Hill Street Blues' greatness?  It's the writing!  (Okay, and the acting by a hugely talented ensemble of then-unknown actor..and the photography, shot with a film-like eye for detail...and Mike Post's music...okay, it's everything)  But the writing is outstanding, even dealing with the restrictions the network censors put in their way (thus, ""hairball"" and ""dogbreath"").  If you have seen the first season, who could forget the moment at the end of the last episode of LaRue, finally confronting his alcoholism, attending an AA meeting, and finding Furillo there.  What series in 1981 would have had its stalwart, heroic lead be a recovering alcoholic in AA?  Today, of course, but then?  Of course not.  So I'm looking foward to season two, assured that great writing and acting will still entertain, shock, and move me, even after twenty three years.",1143590400,12,1103,5.11731843575419
2521337,5,B000EHSVC8,"I recently viewed the newly released first year of Hill Street Blues on DVD. I was a big fan of this show in the 80's (back then, I even had hoped my second child would delay being born until Friday so I wouldn't have to miss Thursday night's episode!)The DVD did not disappoint. Seeing the great, perfectly cast ensemble of actors who brought these characters so vividly to life was a real treat. The bonus section was a chat among many of the series regulars, which was also fun to watch. Can't wait for Season 2 to be released in May.",1142812800,6,537,4.326732673267327
2521338,5,B000EHSVC8,"Half way through season one discs and season two will be a must have. Great characters Capt. Furillo, Sgt. Esterhaus, LaRue, Washington, Hunter, Goldblume, et al. If you're not familiar with these names buy season one and then join me in ordering number two. Entertaining story lines mixed with part grit, humor and lots of pathos. Quality TV that stands up well about an inner city police precint. One of the best TV series ever, winner of multiple Emmeys and highly recommended.",1140480000,40,480,4.865853658536586
2521339,5,B000EHSVC8,I had never seen this series before it ran on H&I and I love it.  I have moved to an area that does not carry the H&I channel so I ordered the series.  I never get tired of the programs regardless of how many times I watch them.  There is so much going on in each program that as I re-watch each one I usually pick up on some little nuance I had missed.  The cast is fantastic and the stories are pretty much true to life in the area of the city it covers.  I would not hesitate to recommend this series to anyone.  You will love it.,1484006400,,533,3.8440366972477062

2521380,4,B000EHSVC8,"Lets be careful out there.

Large ensemble casts such as this show had make demands on an audience that often result in a shorter lifespan than this ones seven years. Kudos to the network for sticking by it, such loyalties are rare these days. Its still hard to believe that Mick Belker--the Animal--had a mother. Pairing him with a simian was a stroke of pure genius. All these officers had lives that were intertwined with their service on the force. It preserved a folksiness that belied the real police work and dangers the officers faced. This show was never formulaic, if you expect a neat wrap up at the end of each episode you will be sorely disappointed. What isn't missing is real humanity and an often cutting sense of humour. These officers aren't afraid to laugh at themselves. There are the requisite chase scenes and more than enough gun play but they do not define what this series was about.

Whatever its innovations the show is a reflection of its era. The officers leather jackets would be too warm for most US Cities today and bullet-proof vests are still a point of discussion. Their hairstyles and casual clothing definitely date the show. Their patrol cars and crossbucks are from another era.  The precinct phones are touch tone but the show predates desktop computers and cell phones. Pay phones are on every street corner and reports are typed on clunky old mechanical typewriters. Reports are filed in cabinets.  What hasn't changed are the courts and justice system that favours those who can afford to buy justice. Rare is the public defender who will go to bat for the little guy. With courts over-crowded most cases are plea-bargained. The young law student for whom Joyce Davenport goes the extra mile is a refreshing change. The types of crime may have changed but human nature hasn't and in the end it is the shows humanity that makes it worth watching. The kitten in the forager hat that mews at the end of each show is priceless.",1399161600,,1966,4.7063953488372094
2521381,3,B000EHSVC8,The show itself was great but very disappointed after buying season one and two found that some episodes were missing from each disk. Sure makes me think I purchased a boot leg copy. I was not happy about that and disappointed Amazon would sell those and make it look like we are getting the full season.,1394841600,,304,4.446428571428571
2521382,5,B000EHSVC8,Bought this for my father in law as a Christmas gift. He is a huge fan of the show. Item came packaged well and was as described.,1394755200,,129,3.814814814814815
2521383,5,B000EHSVC8,"This was ground-breaking TV, and it holds up even today. We find ourselves liking the same characters, and disliking the same characters as we did when this show was introduced. The theme song is stuck in our heads, and we look forward to watching an episode almost every evening.

There's something wonderful about watching a great TV series in order.

The only gripe is that the shows are on both sides of poorly marked DVDs, so there's a lot of jumping up to get to the right place.",1392163200,,485,4.5
2521384,5,B000EHSVC8,it is a cool show and also the show is fun to watch. they should  continue the show and  dvd,1390780800,,92,3.55
2521385,5,B000EHSVC8,Start with Season 1 and go from there. Great drama that keeps you involved with many stories of cops lives on a continual thread...this is how TV should be today!,1388793600,,162,4.433333333333334
2521386,5,B000EHSVC8,"Too bad only a few seasons of this tremendous program are available!! This classic TV series is worth watching from each hour enclosed in dvd!! The realistic police moments are all too true even if they are fiction.
You will not make a mistake owning this collection!",1388448000,,267,4.702127659574468
2521387,5,B000EHSVC8,What can I say?  I was a Deputy Sheriff when this show was on TV and it and its theme song have become a part of me.  It's probably the best and most human police drama I have ever watched.,1388188800,,189,3.7
2521388,3,B000EHSVC8,"Ordered the first 3 seasons. Arrived by the estimated date, but the quality is not great. Some garbled A/V and Seasons 1 & 2 had  occasional subtitles that could not be removed via my DVD player.",1387152000,,195,4.416666666666667
2521389,5,B000EHSVC8,Good series.  Is a shame the entire series cannot be purchased.  You have to wonder about the thought process of not releasing the entire series considering all of the awards it received while running.  Doesn't make any sense.,1386806400,,226,4.894736842105263
2521390,5,B000EHSVC8,"Great show.  Well written, well cast, well acted.  A classic police drama with attitude and humor.  If only they would issue all of the seasons on DVD or make them available for download.",1385510400,,187,4.606060606060606
2521391,5,B000EHSVC8,"Hill Street Blues was the first realistic police/detective show that spawned so many others. I watched every episode during its tenure on TV. This series popped into my mind a few months ago. So I bought Season 1 and have now bought Season 2. I haven't watched #2 yet but I know that it will be better than #1. I remember that each new Season was better than the previous. The good thing is, even if you were fortunate enough to watch it on TV, it's been so long since it aired, it will be like watching it for the first time all over again!. Believe me, I will be purchasing the entire series (one at a time though). I urge everyone to start with Season 1 and then you'll be hooked too!",1385424000,,687,4.172932330827067

2521396,5,B000EHSVC8,One of the best shows of the 1980's. They don't make shows like this anymore. Can't wait for the rest of the series on DVD.,1379116800,,123,3.96

2521398,5,B000EHSVC8,"You never know whether a series that you enjoyed many years ago will have aged well.  Hill Street blues has.  The characters are still great and it still has great style.  If only they would release the rest to the series.  Hill Street was a break through when it first came out and only just survived to get a long run.  This series is the exception in american television, in that something new, fresh and different was given more than a token run.

2521401,5,B000EHSVC8,Very realistic.  It also introduces the concept that the police deal with other crimes than murder.  The show lasted about one season too long.,1376352000,,143,4.916666666666667

2521425,4,B000EHSVC8,"Never watched this show before the DVD. The first few episodes of season one, it was like they were looking to figure out if they were Barney Miller, or a serious show. By the end of season one, the show had rhythm, and it carried very well into the second season.  Too bad only these two seasons are availible on DVD, the show  had settled into something worth watching, a mixture of
social commentary,police action, and an affinity for the various personalities..",1349827200,,465,4.658536585365853
2521426,5,B000EHSVC8,Hillstreet Blues was one of the best police shows that was ever aired on television and it's awesome to be able to watch all the series without the annoying interruptions by commercials.,1348099200,,186,4.84375
2521427,5,B000EHSVC8,Loved these shows in the 80's and they are just as good as they were back then.  The quality of these DVD's is great!,1347235200,,117,3.875
2521428,5,B000EHSVC8,This may be one of the greatest series ever.  It is right up there with Mash.  Certainly it was the beginning of the police series that depended on ensemble casts.,1347062400,,163,4.4
2521429,4,B000EHSVC8,"As I said in my other review of HSB, I never watched this cop drama when it first aired. That being said this show is kind of addictive. I like to follow Renko and Hill, Larue and Washington. Belker is fun but a good bit overdone. I actually felt sorry for the black actor, the thief, who Belker keeps calling Dog Breath. To continue making this guy be a nobody into season 2 only degrades the actor. Either let the thief become a character of substance or let the guy be. I mean, we get it. Belker brings the thief into the office. Belker's mom calls with some complaint about her husband. The thief laughs and Belker chides the thief. Anyway, This show should be available on dvd. I WILL NOT be buying any Amazon.com instant video. I never have bought instant video and I surely have no plans to watch a tv series on my computer. I have a nice comfortable lazy boy chair that beckons me and serves my body well as I watch my movies and tv shows. I do NOT plan to sit her at my computer watching movies and tv.

2521430,5,B000EHSVC8,"This simply has to be the best cop drama ever. Sure there were plenty,from Dragnet to NYPD Blue,but the HSB series has the grit and realism that can you actually relate to.
There are no characters here to not like. And the opening theme song is a perfect juxtaposition to the frenzied release of the patrol cars hitting the streets after dispatch (in fact,one nearly spins out on the snowy street).
Now,if Amazon can get their hands on the subsequent episodes I would surely be glad to add them to my collection.
After all,HSB had me in the opening scene in Season 1 where Esterhaus tells all the officers to turn in their ""unauthorized""back-up weapons before hitting the streets.
Thank you Amazon.",1339459200,,698,4.729508196721311

2521433,5,B000EHSVC8,"Still one of the best old police shows.  No gore, like so many today.  The characters are all interesting and quirky.  Each has their own story going on, as well as what goes on in the precinct.  Much more interesting than the current CSI's and few others.",1306627200,,256,4.382978723404255

2521435,5,B000EHSVC8,"I loved this show when it first came out in the early 1980's.

It was the first realistic TV police drama and it was a revolutionary, trend stetting and ground breaking style of show for its time. Among other things, it was the first TV police drama to feature hand held cameras moving through the sets.

Later shows like NYPD Blue and Law & Order all owe a large debt to Hill Street Blues.

Unfortunately Hill Street Blues seems a bit dated now but it's still worth having on DVD.

Among other things, it's interesting to see some of the bit players who appeared on Hill Street Blues before going on to bigger things. For example, check out a young Micheal Caruso (who went on to become the lead in CSI Miami after a stint on NYPD Blue) as the leader of a street gang called the Shamrocks. Danny Glover also appeared briefly as a violent and sadistic gang leader who ends up being shot by his lawyer/girlfriend.

The second season of Hill Street is better than season 1 (also available on DVD). The writers seemed to have improved with time and the actors playing the main characters appear to have become noticeably more comfortable with their roles by the second season.

Nonetheless, both Season 1 and Season 2 of Hill Street are worth having on DVD.

A ground-breaking TV series.",1292889600,,1284,4.532467532467533

2521437,5,B000EHSVC8,Fans of Hill Street Blues will not be disappointed. Hill Street shows the gritty day to day life of the inner city in the early 80's. Its not a video like special effects police show like many are today. The ensemble cast creates many sub-plots which take the show in different directions and create a fast moving show. The only disappointment is the remaining seasons aren't on video and when you get to the last episodes of season 2 you feel a sense of loss.,1253318400,,460,4.423529411764706
2521438,5,B000EHSVC8,"I never watched ""Hill Street Blues"" when it originally aired.  A couple of years ago, I bought the first, and then the second season of ""Hill Street Blues"" from Amazon.com.; and I've never been more sorry that I did not watch a show during its original run.  As they used to say, ""you know from the opening musical score, that you're watching something special"".  I believe that one of the reasons ""Hill Street Blues"" was such a hit and still holds up so well, is because it was cast with real people, not caricatures.  Unlike earlier series of this genre, viewers had ample opportunity to explore the personal and often flawed lives of the characters.  The appeal of this series lies in its lack of convention.  ""Hill Street Blues"" was one of the first series to use the ""hand-held camera"" technique, enhancing the dramatic authenticity. From the filthy streets, to the dangling storylines, to the popular characters killed off, ""Hill Street Blues"" gave viewers an unpolished look at the lives and work of police in the least glamorous of settings.  The Season Two DVD set comes with a cardboard outer sleeve featuring the artwork, and series title and series synopsis.  Inside the cardboard sleeve are two of the familiar, thin, plastic, clam-like disc holders.  On the backside of the disc holders is a listing of the episode titles and synopsis. Discs 1 & 2, are in one holder, and disc three is in the other. The discs are double-sided. The menu allows you to preview episodes. Hill Street Blues was a huge critical and commercial success during its original run, particularly during the earlier seasons.  When you consider some of the marginal shows which have been released in their entirety, you have to wonder why one the best shows in television history does not merit better treatment.",1251417600,5,1796,4.82084690553746

2521475,5,B000EHSVC8,"Hill Street Blues was the first Police series that truely depicted what goes on in the station and out on the streets. It shows the personalities of several groups of officers both on and off the job and also touches on the dark side that some Police officers have.

 The writing and plots are superb, and the actors couldn't have been better. Charactor's like Renko, Belker, and Lt. Hunter, head of the SWAT Team are priceless. It shows very deep emotions both tragic and comic at the same time, and showed the vulnerabilities that Police officers do have and that they are human afterall.

  As a former Police Officer myself I cannot say enough about the quality and realism of Hill Street, and over the years only NYPD Blue has come close to equaling Hill Street.

As a nurse who was working in an Emergency Room at the time, we had cops in and out all the time and frequently they would stop late at night for a cup of coffee with us. One night I was angrily speaking about what I thought was Furillo's unfair treatment of Renko, when one of my favorite cops said, ""Mena, get a grip! You're taking this show far too seriously."" But the show was so well done all of them were so REAL.

On another night in the ER I made mention of Howard to some SWAT guys that were in our ER and they got so angry, one of them went on a rant about how UNrealistic Howard was. What made us nurses all laugh afterwards is THIS guy acted just LIKE Howard.

I have waited SO long for this show to be released and can't wait until I can sit down with my just ordered seasons 1 and 2 to immerse myself in the show once again.

If you never saw it--BUY IT!!! To this day there has never been a show to equal it. Brilliant, and totally addictive!

2521480,5,B000EHSVC8,"Hill Street Blues is not a happy show per se. Sure, it is frequently funny, but it is a MASH brand of gallows humor. The show is also tragic, violent, gritty, at times it is even emotionally overwhelming. So why do I call it feel good television? Because watching it makes me feel good. I can't describe it exactly, all I can say is that I have turned into a Hill Street Blues addict. It has reached a point where I can't sit down and watch a single episode, I have to watch two, three, even four. God help me, Hill Street Blues is wrecking my social life! But I'm loving every minute of it.

Needless to say, I consider Stephen Bochco's series to be one of the hallmarks of television. It is a brilliant, groundbreaking, highly ambitious program that isn't without its flaws, but then how many great works of art are truly flawless? Strangely enough, it reminds me of the original Star Trek, ahead of its time but also very much a product of its time. Sure, the acting isn't always the greatest, but every actor embodies his or her character so thoroughly that it is impossible to imagine these roles being played by anybody else. Sure, the show can be overly melodramatic, or didactic, or dated, or cliched, or juvenile, or even corny...again, so what? Watching Hill Street Blues is like watching the whole art form of TV undergoing an incubation process, gradually evolving into adulthood. Besides, each episode is so varied due to the ensemble cast and the multilayered style of storytelling that even if you're groaning one minute, you know that you are going to be laughing or crying or simply sitting back and admiring the incredible artistry of the whole thing the next. There may be bad moments, but no bad episodes. Even the opening credits are brilliant. Most TV shows on DVD, I fast forward through the main theme, but not Hill Street Blues, here the opening is an integral part of the rhythm of the show and losing it feels like missing out on something substantial. Hill Street Blues is endlessly entertaining, a joy to watch...feel good television.

I am eagerly looking forward to season three, and also dreading it because I know that I will once again be a slave to my house, to my television set. And loving every minute of it.",1151798400,43,2246,4.58457711442786

2521482,5,B000EHSVC8,"Watching Season Two of ""Hill Street Blues"" again for the first time in many years, I was surprised that the second season gets off to a slow start.  The first four episodes deal with the return of gang leader Jesse John Hudson (Danny Glover), and then there are a couple of episodes dealing with the violent Officer Jerry Nash (Stephen McHattie).  But neither of these plot lines are particularly engaging.  Then we get to the eighth episode of the season ""The World According to Freedom,"" and everything changes.  Not just this is because it is the first of four episodes with Dennis Dugan as Captain Freedom (""Dum dada dah!""), but became Captain Furillo (Daniel J. Travanti) becomes enraged when there is a bloody massacre at a sleazy night club.  Every gang leader on the Hill is rounded up to hear Furillo read the riot act and threaten them with a return to the old days (and worse) if the killers are not turned over to him.  The twist at the end of this episode is surprising, chilling and sobering.  After this episode we have the continuing run ins between Captain Freedom and Mick Belker (Bruce Weitz) that continues through ""Pestolozzi's Revenge"" and ""The Spy Who Came in From Delgado"" to the tragic story of ""Freedom's Last Stand.""  The story arc is celebrated by the ""Confessions of Captain Freedom"" Featurette, plus commentary by the cast and crew on both the first and last episodes in the quartet.

These episodes are followed by another strong storyline as Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamill) is devastated by the murder of her friend, Public Defender Pam Gillian.  Although she is not a member of the Hill Street precinct, Davenport is the conscience of the series and when she tells Furillo she wants the head of Pam's killer on a stake in the middle of Decker Avenue, your blood freezes.  Davenport losing her faith in her job the low point of the season, whereas the high point would be her dramatic way of letting Furillo know she agrees to having an open relationship (notice later on in the series that she is equally impulsive when it comes to getting married).  So there is a mix of very strong plotlines in these middle season stories combined with relatively weak subplots, with Furillo testifying before the grand jury and the election of Bobby Hill (Michael Warren) as vice-president of the Black Officers Coalition.  The attempts at black comedy do not always work, as the pain of the troubled relationship between Andy Renko (Charles Haid) and his dying father (Morgan Woodward) ends up being about the corpse being stolen in the season finale, ""Invasion of the Third World Body Snatchers.""  Still, in the end, I round up on the second season when ""Hill Street Blues"" won its second Emmy for Best Drama, because when this show is really good it is pretty great and also because our fond memories of the brave new world this series opened for us on television counts for something as well.

Otherwise, things stay pretty much the same on the Hill, but with a twist.  Gangs are always causing problems but that is no reason not to have a charity basketball game between the gang bangers and the cops (""Personal Foul"").  When Hill and Renko are not going at each other, you have J.D. LaRue (Kiel Martin) start drinking again, which makes Neal Washington (Taurean Blacque) cut him loose as a partner and Furillo send him to the Motor Pool.  Lucy Bates (Betty Thomas) is still putting off the advances of her partner, Joe Coffey (Ed Marinaro), and dealing with the problems of being a female cop (""The Second Oldest Profession"").  Frank's love life is getting better but his ex-wife Faye (Barbara Bosson) suffers a major blow, Howard Hunter (James B. Sikking) has a bad dating experience, and Henry Goldblum (Joe Spano) sees his marriage collapse.  Phil Esterhaus (Michael Conrad) still says ""Lets be careful out there"" at the end of the morning roll call, but suddenly he is working a lot of French into his conversation, and, yes, police widow Grace Gardner (Barbara Babcock) is still around causing problems for more than just Esterhaus.

To be official, Emmy Awards for the second season in addition to Outstanding Drama Series include awards for Lead Actor for Travanti, Supporting Actor for Conrad, ""Freedom's Last Stand"" for Writing, ""Personal Foul"" for Sound Mixing, and Film Editng for ""Of Mouse and Man.""  There were 14 other nominations for ""Hill Street Blues"" that year including acting nominations for Hamel, Blacque, Warren, Weitz, Haid, Bosson and Thomas, and writing nominations for ""The Second Oldest Profession,"" ""Presonal Foul,"" and ""The World According to Freedom.""  Yes, ""HSB"" had all five of the Outstanding Supporting Actor nominees (and nine out of twenty in the acting categories) as well as four of the five nominees for writing, all of which proves that in the 1981-82 season this was as good as television got.

In the addition to the above commentaries and special features, there are also featurettes on ""The 'Hill Street Blues' Story"" about the show's increased success in the second season and a pair of character studies with ""Belker Unleashed"" and a look at Andy Renko in ""A Cowboy on the Hill.""  It is certainly instructive to see that this cast and crew, twenty years down the road, are a lot more insightful and revealing than their current contemporaries in such special features.  It would be nice if there was more of the same, but what is here is cherce (the actors draw our attention to the fact that Travanti likes to just stand there and not move when he acts whenever possible, and from that stands out in every episode).  I also want to comment on the streamlined approach to making these episodes available on DVD.  Each volume consists of two small cases, the first with two discs and the second with one (but with the opportunity to have two in each if the show ever gets around to having more than eighteen episodes in a season).  On each disc there are four episodes on Side A and another two on Side B, along with some additional special features.  More television shows should be done this way, but the only thing I have similar is for Joss Whedon's ""Firefly.""  But they have certainly avoided bulky packaging and come up with a format that (hopefully) they will stick to as they release the other seasons of ""Hill Street Blues"" on DVD so that the full set is a matching set.",1151280000,7,6353,4.7639015496809485
2521483,5,B000EHSVC8,"I just finished watching the complete season 2.  It is shocking

just how much better this series was than anything on the major

networks in recent years.  First, and foremost, is the quality of

the writing.  The cast has a diversity of behavior that simply

would not be permitted today.  Some of the great scenes are just

too politically incorreect for today's TV.  This show is gritty,

funny, and always entertaining.",1149552000,11,424,4.830985915492958
2521484,5,B000EHSVC8,"Season 2 of Hill Street Blues out, and what a great season it is!  The characters continue to grow and evolve, the storylines get more intense (they may seem a bit over the top with age, but I still love them).  My only three gripes:

1. No meaty bonus material.

2. I really HATE the double sided disk format.

3. Season 3 is not out yet.

Pick these up, with all due haste.  And hey! Let's be careful out there.",1148515200,10,413,4.0875
2521485,5,B000EHSVC8,"I have been waiting to see this show again for nearly twenty years and after whetting my appetite with Season One, it has been a long four months waiting for Season Two.  I am thrilled that it is finally here -- with even more extras than Season One.  It also looks like the production quality of the DVD is a little better on this season.  In any case, if you haven't watched season one, buy the combo and be prepared to become addicted.  There hasn't been anything on tv to match, much less surpass, Hill Street in 20+ years.  If you like superior writing and engrossing drama and comedy, watch this DVD, and you will no longer wonder why HSB has such die hard fans.  In fact, you are sure to become one!

2521486,5,B000EHSVC8,"I waited for a long time to see HSB on DVD. Meanwhile, every other series from the past (and present) was being released. The wait was worth it; it was a joy to see these episodes again after so many years. The set and the acting hold up well. The issues are timeless and you can identify with all the characters. LaRue is a jerk, but a loveable one, and you really want to see him get over his addiction. I always liked Furillo's 'grace under pressure' performances. He rarely raised his voice; sometimes he didn't even reply at all. But when he did, it was with authority.

On to Season Two!",1146873600,6,593,4.294642857142857

8110378,5,B000EHSVC8,"Captain Freedom was a risky proposition.  Part The Greatest American Hero ripoff this choice could have been a disaster for HILL STREET BLUES SEASON 2.  It was not a disaster and was actually played perfectly by Dennis Dugan, with the ragged, wannabe superhero dressed in orange cape and green gloves and 1930's motorcycle goggles, given not one but two well written All-American speeches that has ""Animal"" Belker (Bruce Weitz) realizing Captain freedom has the right spirit -- even if he is delusional and a danger to himself.
The ending of the Captain Freedom saga is right out of a well filmed movie.  Quite memorable.

As is becoming the standard around the HILL STREET neighborhood, violence strikes a nerve close to home when Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel) approaches the end of her career rope when a lawyer colleague is murdered.
Renko (Charles Haid) is having a difficult time coming to grips with his estranged father who is stricken with cancer.
And Grace Gardener (the always ""in heat"" Barbara Babcock) continues her sexual torment of Esterhaus (Michael Conrad).  I personally almost tire of her schtick but I keep watching.  She is radiant, to put it somewhat mildly.
I mention some of the lighter fare, here, which is probably the worse part of the show for some, but the drama and police work are truly gritty and real.
I recently saw POLICE Story Season 1 and HILL STREET BLUES SEASON 2 overall is consistently better.  Like the 1st season of HILL STREET I continue to have no problem watching 3 episodes in a row.
Greatest show of the 80's -- and then some!?
By the way this is the season policeman Coffey (Ed Marinaro) eventually appears.
Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon movies) has a big part as Hudson a local product who does community work in the neighborhood.  Is he for real?

The xtras are two commentaries by actors Haid, Dugan, and Weitz as part of the Capt freedom saga with the writers also commenting on a 2nd Capt Freedom episode.  Pretty good.  The featurettes are about Belker and that Freedom dude; and there is the HILL STREET BLUES (back)STORY.
Too bad there are not more Gag Reels because one is a laugh riot with (you guessed it) Capt Freedom.",1488412800,,2179,4.7686170212765955
8110379,5,B000EHSVC8,"Great. I highly reccomend this series.
Classic and, based on 20 years experience in Law Enforcement, the day to day experiences of the officers are right on although they do take certain dramatic liberties (doesn't Hollywood always do that) with exaggerated frequency.
Still though the best of bread in what it's really like to be a cop, with all the humor, drama, tragedy and politics that go with the job.",1484092800,,407,4.828571428571428
