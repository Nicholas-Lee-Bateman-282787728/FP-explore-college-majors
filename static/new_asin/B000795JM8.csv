8046047,4,B000795JM8,My son loves barney This collection teaches him so much. From colors to emotions and numbers. This is a very educational distraction for children. It allows me to get all of my household cleaning completed and still interact with my son.,1318464000,,237,4.804878048780488
8046048,5,B000795JM8,"This dvd selection entertains my 20m daughter...she's mesmerized by Barney and friends and I like the messages it brings across.  Of course, since she is so enthralled, I limit her viewing times.",1236038400,,195,5.09375
8046049,5,B000795JM8,"Almost 3 hours of enthusiastic entertainment, my bay is only 5 months now and she loves Baby einstein, she is begining to love Barney as well, some doctors say it's not really educational, but with all the violence the is on T.V. now a days I prefer my baby watching Barney than regular tv, since we as adults are hooked up with it then I play Barney for her 2 times a day for half hour and that gives me time to wash dishes at least. We bought one for my friens 13 month old and still today she calls me to thank me, after 2 months.",1231632000,,533,3.9906542056074765
8046050,1,B000795JM8,"I know many people think this Barney character is a legitimate representation of the dinosaur species that once ruled this planet. Some scientists believe that dinosaurs were benevolent creatures, which may be true, but so far no evidence has been found that they were even known to sing, let alone repeatedly chant a tune that can only be described as a patently goofy theme celebrating universal love.

Also no representations of dinosaurs generated from fossils have ever shown them to have this dinosaur's grin. Given the teeth alignment of the common dinosaur, for this Barney to have the permanent grin that he possesses would have made him a freak of nature, and VERY unlikely to reproduce with other dinosaurs.

And for crying out loud, dinosaurs were NOT purple. Honestly, where in the world did that come from? And there's that voice, and the dancing and even the hopscotch ability. I could go on and on.

I just have a problem with this sort of evolutionary revisionism. The Barney people have taught a generation of kids that the once-prominent dinosaurs were friendly purple goofballs who sang ""I love you"" all the time. A minimal study of the dinosaur fossil records will easily show this to NOT be the case. It's time for serious scientists to gather and take a stand here.",1229644800,4,1288,4.845454545454546
