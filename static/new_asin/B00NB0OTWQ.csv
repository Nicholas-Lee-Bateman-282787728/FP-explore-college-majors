I could of been in the video SCARY.  As far as the workout, not bad like other ones better.",1414540800,6,260,3.8679245283018866
6629950,2,B00NB0OTWQ,I was very disappointed with this dvd.  I've been using Leslie Sansone dvds for years and for me  this one did not measure up to her  previous  dvds. I didn't feel like I got an effective workout and the cast of walkers did not seem to be into the walk.  I do not recommend it for intermediate or advanced walkers. It would probably be ok for beginners.,1414368000,18,353,4.208955223880597

6629953,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"**DVD Menu**

- 20 Minute Walk (Easy Burn) with or without music
- 30 Minute Walk (Big Burn)  with or without music
- 40 Minute Walk (Super Burn) with or without music

**20 Minute Walk**

I burned 122 calories through this walk (with a calorie watch). It seemed like at the beginning we were walking just a bit too long, but she was briefing in the beginning though. This is low impact, but at the same time, it really does pump up the heart rate. There is no jumping, hopping or any other intensive move. If you've known Leslie for a long time, it's just the simple moves. Toward the end, she does do a cool-down. But she kind of tricked me to believe she was done when she suddenly stopped to give attention to two moms on there. After that, she finished up with the leg stretches. It probably would have been better had she saved the moms for the very last. There are no credits after this. It will just take you back to the menu.

**30 Minute Walk**

I burned 196 calories through this walk. Like in the first one, there is no jumping or intensive moves. However, she did introduce a new move that was really confusing at first. It's the step-tap forward at first, but then she changes it into a step-knee where you kind of turn to the sides as well. I realized I had to hop a little to do it right. The cool down was better than the 20 minute walk becuase she got the arms involved and was more thorough with it.

**40 Minute Walk**

I burned 278 Calories in this walk. So, in total I could burn around 600 calories in this DVD. This one does have a boosted walk, which you'll do twice for around 60 seconds. It's nothing major because it's not an interval boost really. You'll also do side steps with punch and jab. I believe you also do side-step with a hip turn like she did in her Walk to the hits DVDs. There is also a super fast song in this one, but it's only once.

**Music**
If you bought her Mix+Match Walk Blasters DVD that came out two months ago, the music is pretty much from that DVD. There were only maybe three or four that were different. But it was somewhat of a dread to listen to some that repeated. However, there was one particular song I TRULY liked that was from her other DVD that they put in this one. It's the second song from the 30-minute and 40-minute walk. Anytime that song played it just gets me pumped. I was already very tired when I began the 40-minute walk. But when that particular song came on, I noticed I had a boost in energy. Other than that, the music is very well balanced out where you can her and the music at the same time.

**People**
I'm really glad to see Carrie back with Leslie. She was in 4 of her other DVDs about two years ago. Sweet Big Smile Nick is there, along with Nadia and Suzy from Walk to the Hits. The others I did not recognize. But the oldest lady on there (one of the moms she introduced in 20-minute walk) was actually 84 years old. I thought she was at least 50!! Good grief. She's aging well. But Carrie tends to put a smile on face as there was one time Leslie was teasing her by asking if she wanted to walk up two and back. Carrie assumed it was time to but Leslie didn't call it out yet, and they had a funny moment there.

**PROS**

  - She's really good with calling the next moves or being on key. She'll rarely surprise you.

**Cons** Nothing major though

  - Leslie does get off step just a tini bit. It's nothing major though. Sometimes there will be a scene away from her, but when you come back, she's on a different step suddenly.

  - There have been many times where it seems like the music is off key with them moving. I just learned to keep my pace becuase I know by the next scene it would correct itself anyway. But this happened all through the DVD.

**Neutral**
  - There is no time clock

Other than that, I think this is a really good workout for beginners, moms in their 50s, or those a little overweight. It's like it was just right; not too easy and not too hard. I'm around 150 pounds and this was wonderful.",1413936000,234,4015,4.189856957087126
6629954,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"What an awesome DVD!  I pre-ordered this DVD because I have used other Leslie Sansone programs in the past, and really enjoy her walking programs.  I just received my DVD today, and did the 20 minute walk this evening.  Leslie Sansone is so upbeat !  I love her attitude!  And she gives clear instructions in advance, so it is easy to follow along with.  Though I have gotten out of shape, I found that I was able to keep up and I worked up a sweat doing the walk.  The time passed so quickly, I could not believe that the workout was already done.  I am so glad that I made this purchase.  I also like that on all three walking programs, there is the option to play the workout with just the music, which I feel is something I will use in the future once I am familiar with the routines.  And at the end, she introduces one of the ladies doing the workout with her.  The woman is 80 years old, and she was able to keep up the pace of the workout.  That tells me, this is a workout I can use for many years to help me stay healthy.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to others.",1413849600,164,1081,4.0663507109004735

6629977,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I have tried a few others of Leslie's but this is my favorite! I work from home and I fit this into my schedule. As soon as I can, first thing before my classes or after I try to get in the first 20 minutes. This usually helps me get rid of the ""I am sooo lazy and do not want to work out today"". So then as soon as I can fit in the 30 minutes I do, and if I'm able after work and before the family comes home I do the 40 minute. At the very least I get my 20 minutes in per day and a good day I get to 30 minutes and a really, really good day I do all three! I usually just hit mute and play my own music to forget I'm watching the same work out over and over again! Someone mentioned that there was a separate cool down and warm up for each segment but I really liked that feature because I was streaming it and it can be so difficult without the dvd menu (yes I've tried the menu with the stream-no thank you) I highly recommend this one-no jumping (good for second floor) no overly complicated moods, and a great workout! I think the 30 day dvd is a bit of a harder workout and a bit more fun but if you're slightly out of shape (and I am) this is a little less out of breath inducing!",1525737600,,1189,3.76

She if full of energy, spunk & positive reinforcements!",1523664000,,345,4.864406779661017

6629981,2,B00NB0OTWQ,"The one mile was too easy and the two mile was way too hard. I obviously didn't even attempt the 3rd mile. You're basically doing a very fast power walk the whole time in mile two, that you're basically jogging. The 2 mile belly blasting is much better. Music was annoying. I'm a 39 yr old female. Definitely didn't enjoy it.",1523404800,,325,4.344262295081967
6629982,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I have been a huge fan of Leslie Sansone for years now and am so very grateful I found her.  With the combination of her great workouts, outside walking plus a healthy lifestyle I have lost 45 pounds.  I have tons of Sansone dvds so I can definitely vary my workouts.  This was the first one I bought and the first one I used when I was at my heaviest and easing into exercise and also miles of outside walking.  It taught me all the basics, taught me how to move my body correctly, introduced me to Leslie and her great motivation and enthusiasm as well as her great fellow walkers including my personal fave Nick.  Now years later this dvd serves a definite purpose.  Normally I do her 3, 4 or 5 mile workouts but after I have been sick or had an extended time away from exercise I need to ease back in and this dvd serves that purpose wonderfully.  I always do one day of the 30 minute or start right away with a couple of days of the 40 before going back to my regular routine.

I have just gone through a difficult period in my life and was away from exercise for 4 months and also put on 20 pounds as well.  What a loss for me these exercise routines were.  But this week I was able to return and back to the 40 minute routine I went.  I did it 2 days with a break in between and then today I was back to a 3 mile workout.  But thank you Leslie for your motivation and true joy that you provide.  Yes I put on 20 pounds but what I have been truly without has been the emotional and energetic lift I get from these workouts.  As Leslie says doing a workout is a great decision and now I am sure you will make other good decisions.  Yes the weight will come back off but more importantly my body is moving again and I feel better inside.  So I use this dvd to ease back in when I have had time away from exercise.  It is indeed gentler on the body than her other dvds and a good beginning.  I recommend this dvd highly as well as the whole Leslie Sansone set of workouts and dvds.  Finding her has changed my life all for the better.",1522800000,,2037,4.022388059701493

Also, I like the fact that there are 3 separate workouts where you can either do 20 min.,30 min., or 40 min.

I like to have a lot of her videos so I don't get bored walking with the same videos.  I'll keep this in the rotation.

Also, this has nothing to do with the rating but I wish she would bring back some of her old walkers!!

Either way, I still think she's the BEST!!!",1518307200,,515,3.894230769230769

6630016,4,B00NB0OTWQ,"I like this workout but it's different than Leslie's other videos. This is three individual workouts with their own warm ups and cool downs. The first one is 20 minutes, the 2nd is 30 minutes and the last one is 40 minutes. So if you're thinking you're going to do all 3 in the same session, it would take you 90 minutes with 3 separate warm ups/cool downs. Anyway, if I had known that I probably wouldn't have ordered it. BUT its like all her other videos. I always get my heart pumping and burn a lot of calories. It would be a good video to pop in when you know you only have 20 or 30 minutes to workout. Love Leslie.

6630151,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I have been using Leslie Sansone's walking videos to work out to for over 15 years. I have some health challenges that make it very difficult for me to do high impact workouts, so these walking DVD's have been a great alternative. They offer the option for you to choose whatever number of miles you are feeling up to, and they offer a variety of different DVD's with different intensity levels; some DVD's have easy walks for beginners or those with health challenges, some DVD's are an intermediate level, and some offer greater intensity by adding some jogging, fast pace walking, and resistance training. I LOVE the variety available.
  Several of the DVD's pretty much follow the same type of routine: walking in place, kicks, knee lifts, and stepping side to side. But this DVD offers some variety: You can do a 1,2, or 3 mile walk. And Leslie has added some new and fun moves, which makes it a nice change from the typical routine. I REALLY like this particular DVD. I have done each of the workouts: the 1, 2, & 3 mile walks and I enjoyed them all. I like that this is not a high intensity workout but more of an intermediate workout - which is what I typically do. I suffer from severe adrenal fatigue, so energy is a BIG issue for me. I never know from day to day how much energy I will have for the day, so I own a variety of these DVD's & choose a workout that fits my energy level for that day. These DVD's have been a huge blessing to me. On days when my energy is depleted I can still choose an easy 1 mile walk, just so I can keep moving.",1481328000,,1554,4.264406779661017

The thirty and the forty minute are great...the twenty minute is quick..great if you want to squeeze it in during the day. It is easy to follow and Leslie is great!!

6630319,4,B00NB0OTWQ,"I've recently become a very vocal fan about how great I think these walks are!  I call them my walk outs!  The only thing I don't like about this one is, and it maybe because I have it downloaded to my video library vs. the dvd is that there is no selection as to which work out I want to do?",1460073600,,292,3.7704918032786887

But nothing too hard core where I can't walk the next day. The second workout is 30 minutes with a few steps I found tricky but the best part about her workout is that you can always just walk in place and are still getting your workout in. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for low impact workout.",1459296000,3,429,4.180722891566265

6630355,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"This is a decent workout, that doesn't take much time and is pretty easy to follow. It comes with 3 different walks. You can choose to do the 20, 30, or 40 minute video. They all go back fairly quickly and I am sweating after. I have a bad knee from sports injuries when I was younger and running can be hard on it. These videos are very low impact and I haven't had any problems with my knee. I've lost 16 lbs so far, doing these and other Leslie sansone videos daily, as well as lifting weights 3-4 times a week, and cleaning up my eating.

As to the actual content of the videos. Listening to Leslie talk, can get annoying after awhile. I tend to tune her out and just listen to the background music to find my pace. There are also of a couple of miscues in all of the videos. For example, she say somwthing like side steps in 4 more walks, but then she miss count or she won't be ready and it really throws off your rhythm. I've done the videos enough, where I remember when they are about to come up and I can just ignore what she's saying to do versus what she's actually doing.  Even with that I'd still recommend her videos.",1456704000,,1132,4.117647058823529

6630357,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"This is perfect for me. It's not the most extreme workout or anything, but it gets me moving. I love Leslie's energy and attitude. She's silly and happy. Some people really respond well to more aggressive motivation, and that's great for them, but for me I love a woman who will joke and smile and make me feel at ease. If I can smile during a workout, I can workout harder, so this is absolutely great for me.",1456444800,7,410,4.269230769230769

The videos are easy to follow and the steps are easily done in a small space/at home. On any workout video, I usually turn down the sound and listen to my own music, and so I especially like that these routines (there are three different ones) are easy to pick up without having to listen to the recorded instructions and background music that it comes with.",1451260800,,516,4.5

Honestly I had grave doubts. It didn't seem like I would be doing enough. But 5 minutes in, I was dripping sweat. Leslie's routine is perfect. I just jump off the couch with whatever I am wearing and start working out.  I don't need a step. I don't need a jump rope. I just need me my dvr and some space.  If I am getting tired i can always return to the walking part of the work out.  The only thing I don't like is that Leslie is a little annoying... she reminds me a bit of Fran Drecher of the ""Nanny"" fame but this particular DVD had a way to mute her but keep the music on.",1450569600,2,734,3.88

6630399,5,B00NB0OTWQ,Leslie Sansone has really great walking videos (if you don't pay attention to her count which is usually off).  I personally love the 20 and 30 minute sessions because I can still take my puppy out for a daily walk without feeling exhausted.  I do the 40 minute workout when the weather is messy.  Her walks are generally very easy and fun.  You can work out with your own music or the sound provided on the DVD.  I personally do not have a problem with her music because I enjoy the fact that the rhythm matches the moves.  I am looking forward to purchasing another of Leslie's sensational workouts.,1449014400,2,601,4.467889908256881

6630402,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I am a Leslie fan for sure!  I often do not have time for a long workout, but these short  routines allow me to pop in the DVD first thing in the morning and get in a short workout before heading off for a long day at the office. You can also mix and match if you want a longer workout. I also love that I can do them in my own living room, since I am not the kind who wants to slog to the gym and put on a show.  I will admit, I am no longer a spring chicken, so the lower impact of these works well for me.  If you are looking for a high intensity, knock you on your butt type workout, these DVDs are not for you.  If you are looking for a moderate, brisk paced workout that gets you up and moving, keeps you in shape and lets you work up a light sweat, this may be your thing.",1448409600,4,779,3.6686746987951806

6630406,2,B00NB0OTWQ,"Great video, only wish her walkers would stop carrying on like a bunch of animals. There were times the walkers were doing their own thing and hooting and hollering above Leslie's instructions and music. I hope she never does another video with these people. It was the women that did all the mouthing off. Leslie's beat was off many times too. She needs to focus more. She talks toooooooooooooo much.

Leslie stop the baby talking. I can't stomach it any longer.
Doesn't Leslie ever read these reviews? I just wish she would exercise for once and get rid of all her walkers. AND where are her walkers over 40? I get so tired to see only these young babies. She needs to cater more to the mature crowd.

I will not purchase another dvd until she stops with the baby talk, chatter and goofiness. After about 3 times you just want to mute her. She is a great instructor but we do not need all the walkers that are there for attention.",1447027200,10,932,4.412790697674419

I really do put a lot into the workouts and I even bought another calorie/step/mile device and I still get the same the same results. I work up a great sweat and I'm in great shape, thanks to Leslie.

This one also adds several new moves which breaks up the monotony of doing the same routine every day. I also love the serenity of the studio in this one. It has a softer vibe then some of the darker tapes I have. I read the reviews first, took a gamble and decided to try it anyway. I'm so glad I did.

I had only tried her Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan video previous to this one and I love that disc too. Walk off Fat Fast is upbeat and fun. Carrie is the only person I recognize in these workouts. The people with Leslie are energetic and the time always seems to go by quickly when I'm working out to this disc. I really like the music and you do get the option to workout to music only.

I like Leslie's video's but I don't always want to hear her talking (especially when you repeat the videos over & over again).
That is my only complaint - I'm sure the DVD has the menu and the options for turning off her voice and doing music only.
The 20 minute walk is definitely a good way to start my morning before jumping into the shower.  Sometimes I only have 20 minutes, and I feel like it wakes up my body.  Definitely not difficult, but you will be breathing faster and need a water bottle nearby.",1442102400,,783,4.158940397350993

As with any video of this type there's a certain amount of ""cheesiness"" that's expected but this one doesn't really bother me.  Overall, I'm very please and will probably add more of Leslie's DVDs to this one later.",1441843200,3,513,4.173469387755102

6630461,4,B00NB0OTWQ,"I really enjoy this work out.  I'm a big fan of Leslie Sansone's walking work outs and I credit them to helping me stay in great shape.  I have about 20 of them and do one a day.  After five years of walking I'd say I'm an advanced walker so I'm basing this review on that.  It's not a workout that gets me in a good sweat and makes me feel that I've broken any plateau's but it's a good mid-week workout when you want an easier workout but still want to break a little sweat.  That's what this one does for you.  (If you're a beginner, however, this workout might be difficult for you).  The music on this one is really fun and keeps you motivated which I love.  I also like the fact that she introduces a couple new steps.  I think, of all my 20 or so DVD's, this is the only one where she changes the ""Step Tap"" move into a ""Step Knee"" move, which surprised me the first time I did it and it took doing this workout a couple times before I got that move down.  She does ""Skaters"" in this one as well and even incorporates them into the double side step which keeps you thinking on your feet and helps the workout go faster.  This workout is pretty much all ""low impact"" although she does have you boost a little when you're doing the ""two steps forward, two steps back move"" but it's so slight that I don't even count that.  Besides, you can stay at the walk without boosting it if you want.  There are 3 different workouts on the DVD but I'm basing this review on the 40 minute walk, which is the only one I've done, I don't bother with the other two.  I do recommend this DVD for a beginner who wants to test themselves and have a little fun or an intermediate and even advanced walker who wants a fun mid-week workout that's not exhausting but still makes you feel that you've done your duty for the day.",1441324800,3,1810,4.119658119658119

I quit smoking 3 years ago and gained a ton or so. I loathed myself for letting myself go to such a degree.

6630528,3,B00NB0OTWQ,I do love Leslie's workouts.  My favorite dvds are 5 Mega Miles and Walk It Off In 30 Days.  I bought this one as I had worked out to the above mentioned 2 ALOT.  I just did not care for this one.  I just couldn't get the hang of the step tap and added knee lift.  I kept stumbling around as that was a move I had not done before. Also the side step into a full circle I didn't really think was necessary but God Bless those who can adjust to new moves quickly.  I just kept doing a regular side step since it got old.  20 minutes is for beginners and the 30 and 40 are for a more energetic workout.  You do repeat the moves regularly in each workout and that's normal.  I just honestly wasn't feeling any of this workout entertaining wise...  Lots of hooting and all.  Different set of people except for Nick who I knew from  the other workouts.  You will get a good workout.  I prefer her shorter workouts as I don't get as bored.,1436918400,6,932,4.049450549450549
6630529,3,B00NB0OTWQ,"Leslie Sansome is my favorite at-home exercise instructor. But sometimes she just re-hashes the same routines over and over. And lately it seems she is trying too hard to bring on the youth crowd with silly dance moves. I do like that you have the option of a music only workout because Leslie can get annoying; she is obsessed with sweat and it is actually embarrassing to listen to her ""I love sweat"" ramblings (one DVD she actually ""borrows"" another exercisers sweat ... it's really gross).",1436659200,3,493,4.744186046511628

They're not high impact so if jarring aerobics isn't for you,  her videos are.
Also, if  you're just starting out, and are as out of shape as I've become,
these videos are easy to adjust your movements to slow your heart rate back down.

free weights and resistence bands for at home cross training.",1434844800,3,455,4.675

6630578,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"This is probably about my 10th Leslie Sansone DVD.  My previous and still favorites are Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan and Walk It Off In 30 Days.  I didn't think there would be another one that I liked more, but this one is coming close.  I really want to do an hour of continuous exercise/walking when I do it, but I tried the 40 minute workout and if you put yourself into it, it is quite the workout.  I like the moves, I don't hate the talking, the music is fine and the participants are fine.  I've tried all 3 workouts, in fact I have done the 40 minute workout, rested for a few minutes, then done the 20 minute workout.  This type of walking/standing exercise is perfect for me.  I will alternate this one about every 3rd day.  I do the Firm 30, 30 minute strength training portion of the Walk it Off in 30 DVD at least twice a week, shooting for 3 times a week.  I have been doing her DVD's for about 18 months and have lost 15 lbs and more than a couple of inches off waist, hips and thighs.  Can you tell I love these DVD's?  This may not be for everyone, but I really think anyone can benefit from giving it a try.  If you're not in great shape, you just walk along to the pace and keep it low until you get used to it, starting with the 20 minute workout and work up to the others.

You are walking along and they pan to her face then when they pan back out the leg is a different leg than she should be on!  She gets talking a lot and her feet get messed up.

I started with the 30 minute burn, which was an okay workout but I didn't really feel it got my heart rate up enough. So I moved up to the 40 minute and have done the workout 7-8 times now.

6630633,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"This video is great because of the options you have: 20 minute workout for the day you are REALLY tired or running short on time, 30 minutes for a good strong work out, and 40 minutes for a more intense work out when you have some extra time for your workout.

I also like that you aren't just marching in place, you move around and have different movements to help get your heart rate up and help you get stronger and fit.",1430697600,,423,4.158536585365853

Update...great videos as shown above.  I'll admit I got off track for a bit. I would vary between the videos. Start slow with the 20 minute and then work your way up to the 40 minute. I noticed after 3 weeks my legs were toning. Vary it up and you won't get bored. I recommend this DVD compared to some of the others because the pace is faster than some of the other DVD's.

6630697,3,B00NB0OTWQ,"First of all, the 30 minute and 40 minute workouts are not truly 30 and 40 minutes.  The 40 minute workout starts cooling down at 32 minutes for about 4 minutes and then stretching for for about 4 minutes.  I suppose you could count the cool down as part of the actual aerobic workout since you are moving, but it's made to seem like by Leslie that this workout is a full 30 and 40 minutes.  I don't know why she doesn't separate out the cool down and stretch from the actual aerobic part like she does in many of her dvds.  This is good if you;ve been sick and want to ease back into an aerobic routine again.  I use this sometimes when I haven't been able to workout consistently and want something relatively easy to get back into a routine.",1428624000,5,744,4.211267605633803

You can tell she enjoys her work and the people that share the workout with her.  It is nice for me at home as I feel like I'm working out with a bunch of people and don't have to leave home to  do it.  I  really think this one is her best, as you have the option of one of three different times, 20 min,  30 min,  and 40 min.  I have combined  2 at a time to get a longer workout or shorter.  At any rate this is the best one for me,  and thank you Leslie for always trying to get the best for stay at home people that don't do a gym.  Judy",1427500800,,712,3.697986577181208

6630713,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I own 35 Leslie Sansone DVD's and this is my favorite!!  There are a lot of possibilities in this DVD.  She combines a lot of moves and different moves that the 40 minute workout flies by.  It seems significantly shorter than even a 15 or 18 minute workout.  So, you will be amazed at how the time flies during this workout.  Please don't complain that the workouts are not resulting in weight loss or seem too easy.  Increase the intensity of the workout.  Exaggerate the moves, boost the walking (small jog), get your arms in the air in a full extension.  Go ahead and purchase this DVD.

I need to get my heart rate up and the 30 minute walk definitely does that.  The 40 minute walk is a challenge.  Leslie recommends that the 40 minute walk should be incorporated into one's routine twice a week.  I'm working up to that.  The 30 and 40 minute ones require some arm work out.  That is good because none of these walks include the stretchy band that I'm used to.  I would recommend this DVD to people who are not workout fanatics.  If you are looking for boot camp, this is not the DVD for you.  If you are looking for a healthy and fun workout, you should like this very much.",1426982400,2,732,4.1571428571428575

It has the basic steps walking in place, side steps, knee lifts and kickbacks in the first 20 mins.  The 30 min segment adds a new step sort of like the cha-cha.  It is a little faster paced.  I haven't really done the 40 min segment but it is much the same.  My only problem with the DVD is that Leslie stops in the middle of the stretching exercise at the end of the first segment to introduce some of her crew.  Not such a big I just do the rest of the stretches while she is chatting.  This meets my current needs,",1425600000,,783,3.9935483870967743

So far I've done t he 20 minute and the 40 minutes and enjoyed them both. I was also totally impressed with the 80 year old woman who is in the 20 minute Easy Burn - she definitely does not look her age at all!",1424217600,3,347,3.8333333333333335
6630854,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I have at least 10 of Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs and have been doing them way back when they were on VHS.  I like this one the best.  Instead of couting ""miles"" and waiting for the next mile marker like most of her other DVDs, this one is in minutes, 20, 30, 40 minutes.  It's a nice change. I have only done the 40 minute routine, but do it 3 times a week, and I really like it.  I find that with her other DVDS, the mile markers are actually somewhat distracting to me because if I'm in it for 4 miles I'm always looking for that next mile marker instead of just doing the routine.  Since this is based on minutes, it just seems to go faster. I don't think the 20 or 30 minutes would be enough for me, so I just do the 40, which is a good solid, low impact routine, and when I'm done, I feel like I've had a good workout.  I recommend this one to anyone who doesn't want to deal with DVDs that have complicated or difficult moves.  It's very easy to follow and you will get a good well rounded workout in the comfort of your home.",1424217600,9,1035,3.995145631067961
6630855,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I really like Leslie's style of presenting her workouts.  When I first heard of them, I thought, ""Are you kidding? Walking in place as a workout?"" But for me, it is absolutely perfect!  I do not like working out in public, and I cannot consistently walk outside in my area.  I am VERY pleased, and will purchase at least another of her DVDs for a variety.",1424131200,,355,4.348484848484849

6630858,3,B00NB0OTWQ,"First I want to say I enjoy Leslie and have lots of her DVDs. In this one she introduced something new or at least new to me. It was those two steps forward with the taps and the knee thing just after it. I had no clue what they were doing. So my problem is, why can't she go over all the steps in the warm up when the pace is slower. She does the four basic ones each time but no one would have an issue with them. I know she says you can just walk as long as you keep moving but I am sure most of us would prefer to do what she is doing.",1424044800,3,539,3.5762711864406778

6630860,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I have been a fan of Leslie's workout for years and this one doesn't disappoint. The main reason that I love her workouts is because I have a bad knee and find that I never have any problems with any of the moves. I enjoy the simplistic moves, no choreography to try to keep up with. Another thing I like is that with this DVD there are 3 different workout lengths, so if you don't have a lot of time you can do the 20 minute workout. Honestly, the time felt like it went by so fast that I couldn't believe it when she said it was time for the cool-down. The workouts on this DVD are simple and fun that I just can't come up with a reason not to do them. Awesome job Leslie!! Another winner!",1423958400,,691,4.0144927536231885
6630861,2,B00NB0OTWQ,"This dvd has some really fun programs. However about halfway through the disk, there was a lot of skipping and sralling which interrupted thr program.

6630862,5,B00NB0OTWQ,I have many of Leslie Sansone workout DVD's so I really don't need anymore but I like to have options.  Some days I feel like a shorter walk and some days longer.  Sometimes I play them on mute because her chatter annoys me at times.  The workouts are easy to follow but it is a very good workout.,1423785600,,297,4.086206896551724
6630863,5,B00NB0OTWQ,Great video!  Love the fact it gives you 3 different workouts geared towards whatever time you have that day.  Sometimes you only have a good 20 minutes to workout.  Who knew this type of walking keeps you motivated?,1423785600,,216,4.631578947368421
6630864,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"This video is tons of fun.  I have only done the 40 minute and it was great.

Whether I did her 30 minute Big Burn or 40 minute Super Burn, I felt that I was able to get in a productive workout. The 40 minute Super Burn incorporates more toning moves to tone the arms, core, legs and rear-end.

A lot of the moves where very hard to follow and the ""40 minute super burn"" was not even close to any  super burn of her pervious DVDs.

6630869,5,B00NB0OTWQ,I love Leslie...inspirational and fun...I wish she would separate the warm up (just one for entire DVD) from the workouts so you know exactly what pace you're going...one if her faster paced workouts and added light weights will really get your heart rate up!,1423526400,,259,4.909090909090909

No so-called intervals, no jogging here. I have not liked her recent videos that included those. Also no overbearing, over-loud music like the recent ones.
Regular-looking (fit) people. No models or beauty queens to intimidate or discourage viewers. There is one male participant so men might enjoy this workout too.
All 3 individual segments are stand-alone workouts each with a warm up and cool down.
Very enjoyable all around. My new favorite Leslie workout and one of my all time favorites. I have been using her videos for over 20 years!",1423440000,2,714,4.909090909090909

6630883,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"Finally, Leslie has gone back to doing doable and a workable routine which is conducive for me. I love this dvd so much better than the one done with all the young dancers. I love that she has included an 80 year old walker who looks like she's in her 50's. So motivating!!!! Thanks for remembering not all of us can do the previous ones made.

This is a really good one for working up a sweat, especially if you do the three mile walk. They are all pretty similar, but it can get boring if you do the same tape all the time.  I prefer the variety and after doing these tapes for over a year, I can say they work great and I am spoiled.  I love being able to just pop in a disc and jump right into it without having to go outside in the heat of summer or the cold of winter.

6630924,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I like Leslie Sansone's walk programs. They're basic and simple, and this particular one is lots of fun. I bought this only for the 40 minute workout. I am one of those people who don't care about who exercises with Leslie, or what the music is, or how much convo there is. I just go for the workout, and this one is lots of fun. There are skater moves and boxing moves that I particularly enjoyed. No, this isn't some advanced, complicated thing, but it gets you moving, and it IS enjoyable. I also like the music-only feature. I do enjoy Leslie's banter and her instruction, but after many times of doing the same thing, it's nice to have options. Recommended.",1422144000,7,662,4.479338842975206
6630925,1,B00NB0OTWQ,"I agree with reviewer Geraldine, whose post appears January 1, 2015.  I have been ""walking"" with Leslie Sansone some 15 years (since my early 30's) and have stopped buying her DVDs/CDs about 5 years ago.  Other than the noticeable absence of women of all age groups, the workouts have become redundant.  Same old, same old.  I believe Leslie is now in her early to mid-50's and has probably come to the point in her life where changing the status quo may not be a good idea, financially speaking.  If her method works for most people, why change it?

When boredom set in, I stopped buying her workouts.  Too tame for my level of fitness; I prefer high impact workouts on my cardio days and Leslie's method is just not cutting it.  I too, am approaching 50, but am healthier and much more physically fit than others 1/2 my age.

Sorry, Leslie.",1422144000,13,842,4.52317880794702

6630930,3,B00NB0OTWQ,"I am a huge Leslie fan and have done most of her walks. I would rate this as below average in comparison to some of the others (especially from 2009/2010 and any interval walks). There are 3 walks on here - 20, 30, or 40 minutes, each completely independent and each with a warm-up/cool-down, and the voice can be turned off so you hear music only. The walkers are all of the new(er) people from her recent videos and the walkers are significantly better than Leslie, and ore energetic, which makes her more of a mouthpiece than anything else. She (because of her age, I assume) is doing less strenuous walking in comparison to her group, so she spends too much time talking. You can turn off her voice and have music only, but the music is really bad :-(  It's hard to walk to, and because of her constant cue changing you need to hear her voice at least the first few times. And the girls right behind her, they look like oompa loompas, they are so orange with fake tan on their legs, it's hilarious. I didn't get the same feeling of a workout with these videos and as Leslie ages she is losing her skill and now relying on the group to make the video look fresh. It just makes her look old. I would try an earlier dvd and skip this one.",1421712000,8,1239,4.25

6630943,4,B00NB0OTWQ,"I'm a big Leslie Sansone fan.  Her videos are great for people of all walks of life.  This particular video has 3 different workouts, 20, 30, & 40 minutes.  The steps are easy to follow.  She has thrown in a few new steps since Walk Away the Pounds.  These steps are slightly more complicated, but they are only a very tiny portion (like less than a minute) of the workout and if you can't get it you can just walk in place.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is no ""mile marker"" or checkpoints.  Not everyone needs these, but I feel like they help during the longer workouts.  I just set my oven timer before I start so I know when I'm about half done.  I really like this video..I can work up a good sweat even with the 20 minute video and you don't need any extra equipment to do it.  Just pull on your sneaks and start walking!",1421625600,25,865,4.06508875739645
6630944,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I love the look and atmosphere of the new Leslie workouts.  Having a variety of shapes, sizes and ages participating is very inspiring and the banter between Leslie and her workout companions makes you feel as if you're in the class with them.  I think Leslie gives more reminders nowadays about keeping core muscles engaged, and gives more information about what the various moves are doing for you.  That helps keep me going. My all-over fitness has improved more with using walk-aerobics than by any other, fancier, workout, because I could keep it up, and didn't injure myself. I especially recommend this for those who are starting out, or have health problems which rule out high impact workouts.",1421625600,,702,4.932203389830509

I just got this DVD in today and I was very eager to try it, and so far I've only done the 40 minute walk, but I LOVED IT!!
It has a few new awesome move's, the cast is great, and so upbeat, and when they said it was time for the cool-down I was like, ""It's already been 40 minute's?"" Plus, I never sweat, but when I pop in a Leslie DVD, especially the 40 minute one on this DVD, I sweat bullet's, and I really like how it target's the whole body.

6630971,1,B00NB0OTWQ,"I decided to give Leslie another try when I saw this new DVD. I had stopped purchasing her recent DVDs after viewing two other new ones where only 20 and 30 something's were part of her walking groups. That was a big turn-off for me.

On this DVD, the first short walk (20 min.), DOES include a woman in the group who is 80 (who looks great!) and a young mom too, but other than that, it's all 20-30 something's.

After that session, no other age groups appear, all young walkers, not representational at all and IMO, rather offensive.

Isn't fitness suppose to be for everyone, at all ages? I'm in my 50's and in better shape than a lot of people in their 30's. I would hazard a guess, given how long Leslie has been at this, that she is also in her late 40's or early 50's by now. Why would she want to leave out people of all ages, from ALL her walking sessions?

I also wonder where have all her regular walker pals have gotten to, from her DVDs, made years ago?

 I love the Intensity Walk most of all (5 STARS!!!) and use that one all the time. That one is great in terms of all 3 routines AND for including people from a wide range of ages, in all of them...that is more like it!

I also found these routines in this new DVD rather boring and ho-hum. Not much new here. Too easy to really get a good workout, if you are already in shape. I also disliked the music A LOT. Just annoying.

As the saying goes, 3 strikes and you're out and this is the 3rd recent DVD I bought by her that I am now giving away or returning for a refund. Ill stick with her older DVDs in the future or try someone else's that does include participants from all age groups.",1420070400,18,1656,4.105263157894737

It's a pleasure to exercise with her and her group of walkers.  I rotate my work-out DVDs to cut out the boredom factor.

6631002,4,B00NB0OTWQ,"Of all of the Leslie Sansone workouts I own (and I own a lot) this is my favorite.  With 3 workouts on the DVD you have your choice of a quick 20 min. workout, a 30 min. one or a 40 min. one.  Each is different although they do share some of the same steps and some of the same background exercisers.

The 20 min. workout would be perfect for anyone starting out with Leslie Sansone, it's nice a short yet you'll get a decent cardio workout.  Beginners will have plenty of time to learn how Leslie does her DVDs and seasoned walking vets will get a few new moves.

The 30 min. workout builds from the 20 minute one with a few more new moves and a slightly faster pace in the middle.  This is one of those you can make as easy or as hard as you wish.  You will get a decent cardio workout and not get bored.

The 40 min. workout again builds on the 30 min. one, adding a few more new moves and gets faster in the middle.  Again, you can make this as easy or as hard as you wish.  This was my favorite of all three.

As with all of the Leslie Sansone workouts, her constant chatter can be a little annoying but if you've done enough of them you learn to tune her out.  There are enough different type of people working out in the background you can follow any of them to get the type of workout you need.",1419206400,10,1302,3.9845559845559846

As for an 80 yr old doing these exercises:  sure, why not?  Start out doing a mile, lay in a base, and begin to build.

Leslie has it more together with these workouts, with fewer miscues, and without as much of her sometimes irritating jabbering with the cast. I do this video when I want an intense sweat session with no silliness. However, as with all of Leslie's workouts, there is still an enjoyable fun factor.

I've been exercising with Leslie for over 20 years and have had dozens of her tapes and videos over the years, so I feel I'm qualified to say that this is one of her best efforts. Definitely one of my top 5 faves.

I have also tried other exercise videos over the years, but I always come right back to Leslie. Her workouts are much easier to follow and she gives the best instructions for the moves than anyone else I've ever seen. So I put up with her occasional silliness and miscues because overall I have found her to be the best and most motivating exercise instructor out of all of them.",1417219200,8,1012,4.435483870967742

Example: add the 20 min Easy Burn to the 30 min Big Burn without having the warm-up, workout, cool down and stretch on each workout or the 30 min Big Burn to the 40 min Super Burn without having the warm-up, workout, cool down and stretch on each workout or the 20 min Easy Burn to the 40 min Super Burn without the warm-up, workout, cool down and stretch on each workout. You get the idea. Leslie has several of the newer dvd's that you can create/mix and match the workout you desire without having to stop the dvd and go to the next desired workout. When you're in a hurry, trying to fit the workout in a busy schedule, you just don't have time for the cutting out of the cool down & stretch then going to the next desired workout. It actually causes you to do less rather than more and this is a great workout that gives you the incentive to do more.

6631065,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I've only done the 30 minute and the 40 minute workouts, but found myself sweating after both of them.  Leslie really keeps you moving during these workouts.  Anyone complaining about the cues, is definitely not familiar with Leslie's workouts.  Yes, she misses them from time to time, but if you know how she works, you can pretty much figure out where she's heading!  And, yes, she still talks all the way through!!",1416355200,,417,4.75

6631085,4,B00NB0OTWQ,"I have too many Leslie DVD's to count!  I always buy her new ones when they come out.  I really enjoy this one.  I am 64 and I exercise 5 days a week.  Using her DVD's and other equipment. I think I enjoy the DVD's the best.  It makes you feel like you're interacting with a group.  These workouts do make you sweat.  It was interesting to read on other reviews how many calories are burned with each one.  That's great.  The reason for only 4 stars is I miss a few things from her older DVD's.  Like where are some of the older woman, like Jo and Linda and Mary?!!  And the fact that there is no ""countdown"" clock.  I always liked that for the last 10  minutes.  I guess it's mind over matter. But anyway I would recommend this DVD.  Thanks Leslie.",1416009600,10,749,4.104166666666667
6631086,5,B00NB0OTWQ,I'm a fan of Leslie Sansone workouts. This one lives up to my expectations. Great workout!,1415923200,,90,4.6875
6631087,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"Wow. This is really easy to do. I have 2 left feet and can't dance my way out of a paper bag, but I can easily follow this exercise routine. I have only used it for one week (the 20 minute session) and have noticed that my posture is better and I am holding in my stomach without even trying. I will stick with this exercise routine. Looking forward to trying more of the exercise videos in this series.",1415923200,,403,4.113924050632911

6631090,4,B00NB0OTWQ,"This is Leslie's newest video, shot in one of the same studios she's been using for her last several videos (this is the one with the staircase on the left, not the one with the kitchen in the background). I hate the paint job (fake windows made to look as if they open on to a beach) because it reminds me of cheap restaurant frescos, but at least it doesn't make me violent like the horrible background used for the two HIIT videos.

As for the workout itself, I've done the 30 and 40 minute versions. Leslie's latest two videos seem to be aimed at people who are more concerned with exercising for a certain amount of time rather than covering a certain number of miles. The workouts are moderate and low impact- there is no fancy choreography to follow, so that's a plus as well. I  would actually like a countdown clock in one corner to let me know how much time there is left in the program, even if it's just there for the last 10 minutes.

Overall, this is a good workout video- Leslie is her usual self, and her walkers are all energetic. I still miss the old guard from her other videos (Leslie's getting older, but a lot of her walkers seem to get younger)- Mary Kay, Linda, Carol and Joanne, if you're out there, I hope you're all doing ok!",1415664000,12,1252,4.296610169491525

6631111,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"117 - 198 - 258 ... calories I burned with each workout (as per my heart rate monitor). This is comparable to riding my stationary bike at a constant moderate speed (14-15 mph or 22-24 km/ph) for the same amount of time (I'm 56 y.o. and 158 Lb / 72 Kg).  I think Leslie's DVDs are getting better and better and I love this one.  Upbeat music, good variety and even an 80 year old lady participating in the first workout.  Some reviewers are of the opinion that they did not break a sweat, but it all depends on what you put in.  The more effort, the better the result.  If I want to increase the intensity, I just make bigger arm movements or lift my knees higher and my heart rate then rises to the zone I want it to be.  Recommended!!",1414540800,89,736,4.111888111888112

8677075,5,B00NB0OTWQ,Very good workout if you really are overweight and you want something that isn't too strenuous.  The moves are easy but effective and you have the option to pick how long you want to exercise.,1533254400,,192,4.485714285714286
8677076,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"I was looking for an alternative to walking on the treadmill that would include more toning and be more fun. I have a history of carpal tunnel in my wrists and kind of a bad knee. I really wanted to like yoga and have some yoga videos and went to classes, but nearly all the moves have me putting all my weight on my wrists constantly. It's painful and I felt like it's just not the fat burning kind of work out I need. I've also done some boot camp type of work outs, but again, those tend to have nothing but squats which really hurts my knee. I heard a lot of good things about Leslie Sansone, but I was a little bit skeptical. I thought it would just be walking in place for 40 minutes. But ""walking"" is kind of a misnomer because, yes there's marching type walking but also side steps, kicks, arm movements, etc. It's basically aerobics without the complicated dance moves and annoying music. She makes it really easy to follow. I get a good, sweaty workout and move all of my muscles including arms and core. You don't need any equipment and not a lot of space is needed. I would recommend this work out for anyone with joint issues who needs low impact and not a lot of squatting or putting weight on wrists, elbows, knees.",1533168000,,1230,4.283261802575107
8677077,2,B00NB0OTWQ,"Ok, the exercise part is excellent. The DVDs are super flimsly, poor quality. Everybody I personally know which purchased any DVDs within the ""Walk Away the pounds"" series has had to replace their DVDs ... until they just give up. My self included, I bought three different WATP dvds. The dvds each started skipping after the first play. I bought them dvds again, this time with the replacement insurance. Same thing, the new dvds began randomly skipping too. Same thing happened to others & my friends. The workouts are really fun, such a shame the dvd quality is junk.",1532908800,,570,4.767676767676767

8677079,5,B00NB0OTWQ,"When it's too hot walk in our California heat waves or the smoke from forest fires make you a shut-in, these CD's walk routines will give you a sweaty work-out indoors.  The 40-minute walk can be a challenge to first time Leslie Sansone participants but you have the option of a gentler 20-, more brisk 30- or sweaty 40-minute walk.  I like to combine the 30- and 40-minute walk routines for the equivalent of my usual hour-plus power walks outdoors. The options also give me flexibility in adding a walk routine after my usual weight work-outs.  Leslie and her energetic walk partners provide good visuals on boosted moves and pacing.  If you're looking for another Leslie walk CD to add to your exercise CD collection, this might be one that works for you.",1531872000,,758,4.676691729323308
