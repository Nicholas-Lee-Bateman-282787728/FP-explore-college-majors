3121836,1,B00142RXXU,"While this movie had potential for being interesting, it definitely failed. I don't know what it is about lesbian films, but it always seems like development in romance is not enough. These films seem to always include a bunch of other characters and problems that no one really cares about. Conflicts and characters that have nothing to do with the development of the main characters or the plot.

Because of all the extra things going on I never connected to the two main characters. I could tell they they were supposed to be interesting, I could tell that they probably were starting developing, but all the other b/s going on was in the way. At the end of the video I found myself very disappointed.

*Problems in Details*

(Age 9 Too Young) They have this whole thing about illusions and people not being able to remember things when they're 9. There isn't really a limit on how young you're allowed to be for your memories to be valid. Sure if someone says they remember something at age 2, it's questionable, but still plausible. I have memories that trace back to when I was 2 (that can be backed up by other persons). Other people can remember things back to when they were 5. How is 9 too young to remember? That was just ridiculous.

(Misplaced Cop) There's this guy, a police, who has a crush on Jade. For the longest time I didn't even know he was a cop! I didn't know what he or his job was. He shouldn't have been in this movie at all. There was this weird poorly developed love triangle that was starting to form. If the movie was only about him, the tattoo artist, and Jade - then maybe the triangle would have been more interesting and further developed. However, in this situation it just added clutter to the movie's main plot.

(Annoying Younger Brother) OKAY this kid definitely looks old enough to take care of himself. He must be at least 10? I'm guessing 13. I don't recall the movie mentioning his age, but this kid acts like he's 3. He's a crybaby, needy, extremely dependent, jealous, spoiled, and irritating. Is he autistic or mentally challenged? Did I miss that part? Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't keep up with the subtitles in the part where maybe they explained that, but he's very VERY annoying. I wanted to beat this kid. He had no place in this movie because he didn't add anything to it.

The reason I gave this 1 star instead of 2 is because I did hate this film. A lot of it was simply stupid. I think it frustrated me most because I could see how it COULD be a great movie, and it killed me that they ruined every chance they had at achieving it. Seriously, don't waste your money on this.

I know how frustrating it is searching for a decent lesbian film.

3121838,4,B00142RXXU,"This movie intrigued me so much that I purchased it after renting it through Netflix.  It is a story of a young woman (Takeko) who survives a horrible earthquake because she is sleeping over at her girlfriend's house that is much better built and sturdier than her own.  Her father dies saving her younger brother from the collapse of the house.  She gets a tatoo all along her left arm identical to her father's so her brother (being traumatized by the earthquake) will recognize her as someone he can trust.  In her early teens, she meets a young girl (Jade) who develops a crush on her.  Jade at the time is nine years old.  Takeko moves away but returns to the town as a twenty-something woman.  Jade has started a career as a webcam call girl for internet sex, she entices the viewer's to watch her because she is going to get a tatoo.  She goes in search of a tatoo and discover's the girl of her childhood crush has returned and is a tatoo artist.  Jade sets out to seduce her because Jade still feels that she is in love with Takeko.  Jade wants a tatoo exactly like Takeko's but Takeko will not give it to her but draws a beautiful Jasmin flower to tatoo on Jade.  Takeko begins the tatoo and Jade completes her seduction and they make love.  Takeko forgets her brother and he wanders from his school for the mentally challenged.  Along the side of the road, he spots a spider lillie and memories come rushing back into his mind.  He falls and is in a comma.  Takeko realizes that she has forgotten her brother and hurries to the school where he spends his days.  A police officer approaches her and tells her where her brother is.  Takeko texts Jade and tell her that she can never see her again.  Takeko's brother awakes from his coma with his memory in tack.  Takeko is so happy, she sends a voices mail to Jade saying that she was sorry and would be waiting at the tatoo parlor for her.",1218499200,6,1899,4.358974358974359

3121840,2,B00142RXXU,"I'm a fan of independent cinema. I understand nuance and subtlety. There's a big difference, however, between nuance and lack of clarity. Unfortunately, this film is all about lack of clarity.

The story played here involves a tattoo artist, a ""web-girl"", a semi-catatonic brother, a stuttering and pining cop, a possibly senile grandmother and a wanna-be tattoo'd tough guy. Sounds intriguing, doesn't it? Well, it's not. Mostly, this film is disjointed and confusing, at least twice introducing unresolved plot points. The script uses non-linear storytelling and flashbacks to excess. The only problem is, since the plot is played out poorly, it's very difficult to tell exactly where you are in the storyline at times.

Our two main characters, Jade the ""web-girl"" (think online sex worker) and Takeko, the tattoo artist, seem vague with their own history, and though Jade is overwhelmed and thrilled to have discovered her first love working in the local tattoo salon, Takeko has other things on her mind and mostly comes off as detatched.

While I can appreciate the attempt made here, ultimately the film fails on a very basic storytelling level. You never become attached to, or really care about, the characters.

A Technical Note : While the subtitles are easy to read ( a big plus ), they are lacking in the actual translation. For example, ""it is mere a tattoo"". Also, the subtitles have a kind of grammatical error where every word that uses an apostrophe has an extending spacing to it. While this might not seem an issue, when you're reading subtitles, it slows you down significantly as words seem split in unfamiliar places.

This US edition is NOT-RATED but had it gone through the MPAA rating criteria, I'd say it's a PG-13 at best ( for one quick shot of a dismembered body part ).

I would suggest passing on this film. Rent it if you have interest, but think twice about making it a permanent part of your collection.",1210723200,3,1938,4.875379939209727

This movie is very boring, the main producer (which is a lesbian herself, I think) added too much storyline for the movie (from earthquake, an abnormal brother to a web-cam girl involves with polices), which helps to bring down the movie. Sometimes, I just wish the producers had written more about the relationship between the two characters rather than focus on everything else. Also, some of the characters in the movie are very annoying.
