1240124,1,B00000K32N,"This video is filled with horrible camera angles and terrible editing!  The camera angle changes every second!  This aspect alone is horribly distracting! The lighting is overpowering and you can barely see the  dancers-is it a dance performance or a light show?  Poor artistic choice  with their lighting design!  If you actually want to SEE what the  performers are doing...I suggest that you get the Riverdance video!
I  must agree that Flatley has an ego that distracts from the performance.",946598400,4,495,5.1
1240125,4,B00000K32N,"I must admit that I am a fervent fan of LOTD and Riverdance.  I have seen both shows twice and listen to the music and watch the videos almost daily as I do some cardio work after a weight workout.  I also play the music at  my office.  So am I am hooked.  Thus, it was with great anticipation that I  ordered the DVD version of LOTD.  I am glad I ordered it.  I play it on our  notebook computer as I bike or Nordictrack (and use headphones).  The  program is just as fine as it ever was.  The video is clear.  There is some  background static that can be heard when the music is low or between  scenes, but it is not too bad.  It remains an amazing show that simply  confounds the imagination.  The colors are sharp, the music is hypnotic,  and of course, the dancing is amazing.  I understand Michael Flatley is a  rather confident fellow, but I must say his talents are extraordinary, as  are his costars.  No one is a paragon of virtue, so just enjoy his show and  the DVD for what it is--spellbinding entertainment.  There is some  additional background material included on the DVD; basically an abreviated  version of the Making of LOTD.  It is a nice extra, though it would have  been nice to have some new material or interviews with the DVD.  All in  all, worth every penny.",944006400,5,1285,4.29535864978903

1240302,4,B00000K32N,I still love this original video.  All the ones that follow it focus on things other than the dance itself but this one showcased the dance beautifully. It wasn't just about the costumes or Michael Flatley's ego.  The music works perfectly with the dances.

1240311,5,B00000K32N,"I remember when Michael Flatley made his way into our home via our local PBS station. Our eldest daughter, who is autistic, was only 5 years old. As a lover of both Celtic music and dance, I was thrilled to have this electrifying gentleman enter our living room full of bravado and determination. For all my feelings concerning Lord of the Dance, it was nothing compared to my daughter. She was absolutely entranced! The only gift she wanted was anything with Mr. Flatley as the star. She would practice his movements for hours and she even crawled onto our picnic table to practice each and every move that this wonderful dancer even thought of making!  Unfortunately, we were never able to take her to see Michael Flatley but that didn't stop her love for his performances. Now she is an adult and still listens to Celtic music and watches this charismatic performer.
I believe his influence of Celtic dance made way for those who have followed. I do not believe, however, it would have been easy for the Celtic Thunder gentlemen or the ladies of Celtic Woman to be as successful if it weren't for a certain man from Chicago with an Irish soul.",1429228800,,1146,4.617647058823529

The solo 'Gypsy in Red' sequence stands out as introducing the evil part of the story and they could not have cast a better dancer.  This scence reminded me much of the Gypsy Camp dancer in 'From Russia With Love' as well as how the music was presented by the composer, John Barry.

Micheal Flatley's LORD OF THE DANCE will remain non-dated as it will not age.  His perfamance is greatly complimented by the brilliant talent that he has about him.

Well, I have to say that Lord of Dance was a disappointment for me ...what I loved about Riverdance was the evocative music and choreaography that drew the me in with its mystery and passion.  Flately's storytelling is too literal (example: The ""evil"" black-masked army of Celtic men . They looked more silly than menacing).  Also, I didn't quite understand the function/role of the gold-lame dancer girl/boy with the flute (story teller, maybe?) or the role of the red-dressed woman.  There were some genuine dance moments, a few ""wow, how did they do that"" moments but they are few.  I was also very distracted by the garish costumes and Vegas-style lighting.  The sillines of the this whole production was capped of by the six (or was it seven?) encores at the end of the show.  I had heard that Flately was very egotistical, but I thought it was just a made up rumor ...well, it isn't.  He stood there for about ten minutes at the end of the show taking his bows and pumping his fists ""yes!"" the way I have seen comedians do when they make fun of him, and it was almost too comical to watch ...I'm glad I only rented this DVD ...I would have returned this if I had actually bought it.

  One more thing ...probably the thing that bothered me the most about Lord of the Dance was the video editing.  The camera angles changed so often that it's hard to tell how a scene is supposed to flow ...all of the switching back and forth almost gave me a headache and I almost turned my DVD player off completely.  Maybe if the editing had been better, I would have liked this production a little more.",1179964800,,1783,4.415902140672783

With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots.  They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch.  You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it.  Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.

I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it.  I hope they re-make this DVD.  I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream...",1172534400,20,797,4.524475524475524

Even *if* you could get past the lighting, there's the problem with the audio being disastrously out of sync with the video (even in the first scene, when the flute player didn't even come close to keying with the notes...and on and on and on).

Even *if* you got past the editing, lighting, and sync problems, you're still left with a bizarre egomaniac throwing himself around on stage.

No matter HOW good you think he is (and I do agree he's quite talented) it's obvious that Flatley thinks he's even better.  At the expense of the story, the cohesion, and at the expense of the viewers enjoyment, he's out to show how awesome he is.

Which tells me that other than dancing, he doesn't have a lot going for him.  He kind of reminds me of Mighty Mouse... chest puffed out... ""Here I come to save the dayyyyyy!!!""

Some yoyo was obviously given a board with too many camera feeds, lenses, and angles, and a free hand to demonstrate childish fascination with them by switching from view to view to view almost as fast as the feet hitting the stage. While this might be appropriate for a 30 second commercial advertising the show, it really keeps you from enjoying the perspective of actually watching the show.

The five stars is for Michael and his brilliant group of performers, it IS worth having the disc around. The video production team should return to him double whatever they charged.

I know Riverdance was the first of it's kind (starring Michael Flatley, who else) but this is still my favorite show of all. Flatley is at his best. We get a lot of dance with a littlebit of singing and music. Riverdance just has too many other things going on instead of step dancing. Feet of Flames is more high-tech but to me this is still the one. And then there are all the new shows that keep popping up, but they all learned from Michael Flatley.

As you watch the dvd you can tell how much the dancers enjoy being on stage and you can't help but get up and start dancing yourself. It's a great show, very well put together, nice story, great musicians, great dancers and the one and only Michael Flatley. The only thing that can top this is if you get a chance to see them live.

I agree the quality of the DVD is not the best, to me the colors are too bright and blurry, and sometimes you just wish you could kick the cameraman in the butt so that he'd move his equipment a little, but it is still enjoyable.

Oh and not sure ya'll have noticed but we actually see scenes from at least two shows on this DVD. For example in the scene 'Breakout' if you watch closely you can see that one second the girls have their hair thing on their wrist, then they don't. Just thought it was interesting :)",1136592000,7,1506,4.1331058020477816
1240424,5,B00000K32N,"Michael did a superb job of putting this show together. I believe he was under a great deal of stress. You have to remember, he was just asked to leave ""Riverdance"" not that long ago. He was hurt, felt betrayed, and was left wondering what was going to happen to his career now. I have to give him credit here; because, he picked himself up and started this show, funding it with his own money he earned off of ""Riverdance"". Wow! That took some backbone!! Also, a lot of the dancers quit their jobs, taking a chance with Michael, which had to be more stress on him to succeed.

Michael is a very talented man, his 28 taps a second is mind boggling to say the least!! Now he has to go and show Ireland once again that he still has what it takes. That he wasn't beaten down by the ""Riverdance"" fiasco. ""Lord of the Dance"" was filmed at the Point Theater in Dublin Ireland, July 6, 1996. Needless to say, the show was a success.

The drawbacks are the editing, the lighting, and the cameramen. Amatuers! Also, way too much fogger!! I couldn't see the dancers very well.

So...not the best of viewing... but,  you can still enjoy the mastery that is Michael. The extraordinaire dancers, the two lovely violinist who played some great pieces, Anne Buckley songs were sung beautifully, and the little spirit was spritely and cute. It all fits somehow and was a joy to watch.",1133654400,6,1368,4.438247011952191
1240425,4,B00000K32N,"I'm not a dance expert, but I absolutely love to watch it. The most outstanding characteristic of this performance is the raw energy the dancers portray, particularly the men. The dancers show outstanding discipline and precision; often times large groups of dancers are slightly off from one another rythem wise, but I couldn't catch a flaw of that in this performance. The lighting really brought something to this show and I personally liked seeing parts of the dance from beneath the stage. It should also be noted that 2 female fiddlers give incredible performances within the show. In addition, there is a singer although I didn't particuarly care for that aspect of the performance as she wasn't vocally stunning, difficult to understand, and did little to physically express what she was singing about, but rather just walked around in her giant green cloak (underneath which was some really big red hair). Michael Flately did have the most energy and was fun to watch although I agree he boardered on cockiness occasionally. Overall, it was very interesting and I'd love to see it live.",1123891200,4,1095,4.9890710382513666
1240426,1,B00000K32N,"It's possible the content of this DVD is worth 5 stars, but I'll never know. My husband and I couldn't watch it because of the constant camera angle changes. Just as we'd start to become engrossed in a dancer's moves, they'd switch to an overhead shot or, annoyingly, one from underneath the stage. My husband and I were equally irritated by this and could not even finish watching it.

This film is like those movie montage ""previews"" that show you a snippet of dozens of films without pausing long enough for you to take in what any one of them is. For this reason, this DVD is unwatchable and a total waste of time and money.",1122336000,28,628,4.413793103448276

The constant, rapid shifting of camera angles, including up through the glass floor, combined with the switches to slow-motion video, make the effort to enjoy the tempo and flow of the show effectively impossible. Further, the VHS version alternated between poor lighting and oversaturation of color. Too bad. The performance is high-energy and creative, although without the ""heart"" of Riverdance.  It's a fair-to-poor 90-minute encouragement to see the stage show, if it is ever performed again.  That's about it.",1061942400,,643,5.484848484848484
1240435,4,B00000K32N,"Lord of the Dance is Flatley's baby. He has done for Celtic folk dancing what John Curry did for ice dancing; changed it into something bigger, better and more creative -- truly a new dance-creature. Just as Curry's ice dancing morphed into ice ballet in his genius hands, the ordinarily subdued Celtic dance has morphed into Irish Precision dancing under Flatley's creative genius. With lovely costuming, creative but understated arm movements and a jazzy touch of show biz, not a bad thing in every case, this is a treat for the eyes, ears and soul. Purists may prefer the less flashy, more reserved performances, and there is something to be said for that. But if you enjoy heart-racing passionate soaring dance and can appreciate the monumental precision training and athletic excellence involved in putting together just one dance, let alone several, you will truly enjoy this creative display of a brand new art form. With the exception of the oddball Druidic walk-ons by candle-bearing attendants, it was a cohesively dazzling performance. Say what you will about Michael Flatley's towering ego, he is nonetheless a creative genius. I could have done with fewer dizzying camera-shifts, no doubt a by-product of overzealous camera men who seem to have the notion that viewers have short attention spans. There were fewer such camera-shifts than in the motion-sick ""Feet of Flame"" but still far too many. All things considered, it is Flatley's best of the newer genre of Irish/Celtic folk dance.",1044576000,11,1500,5.1016260162601625
1240436,5,B00000K32N,"""If I would have told you the biggest selling show in world is an Irish dance show, you would have laughed.  But we're here."" (Michael Flatley)  Shattering selling records in Australia, Britain, and the US, Michael Flatley and his show have shown the world that the underdogs can become superstars.  Lord of the Dance tells a story of good vs. evil through Irish dance.  The evil Don Dorcha (Daire Nolan)is seeking to abolish love, beauty, and all that that is good, and to set himself up as Lord of the Dance.  The celts then cry to the true Lord of the Dance (Michael Flatley) who ultmately defeats Don Dorcha.
Michael and his entire troupe are superb, performing everything with precision, ease, and grace.  Filmed from multiple angles, the movie provides the viewer with many perspectives impossible to see from the audience.  This allows one to get a much better grasp of certain formations.  The DVD also contains a fantastic 'behind the scenes' bonus feature which by itself makes the DVD well worth getting.  I have watched it numerous times, and it just gets better.  There are so many little details that add up to produce the greatest show in the world, led by the greatest dancer in world: Michael Flatley.  This is his legacy.",1042070400,3,1239,4.742990654205608

The reason I give this four stars is because I found the camera work somewhat annoying on the DVD.  As other reviewers have noted, the camera angle changes quite often and there are several slow motion effects that I would prefer not be in there.  However, I have read many complaints about the sound quality of this DVD.  I found it to be rather good.  I don't have one of these super nice surround-sound systems (as I suspect most people don't...) so I can't comment on the quality of my 30th channel  ;).

LORD OF THE DANCE is Flatley's run for the brass ring --  all spectacle, little substance.  Sure, the dancing is top-notch (as it was in Riverdance), but the storyline is borderline silly and cornball.  I saw this show live from a front row seat and really fought hard to keep the performers from noticing the pained look on my face during the show's moments of forced sentimentality and cuteness.  An appropriate movie analogy for this show might be INDEPENDENCE DAY -- visually impressive but hampered by a script so lame and insulting that you'd just as soon watch it with the sound turned completely off.  That's the rub with LOTD.  Looks great, but less filling than Riverdance.  My advice?  Skip this one.",1011484800,4,846,4.6938775510204085

Note the DVD I am reviewing is the Universal version which sells for about 5 bucks cheaper than the Polygram version. I do not know if this should have made any difference in the abysmal quality of this DVD since supposedly it was digitally mastered!
First, the disc says it's cut in Dolby digital 2.0 stereo.... believe it or not it is NOT surround sound capable since it only has two, yup count em, two channels .... digitally mastered .... give me a total break .... the sound is so bad on this DVD I checked my equipment cause I thought I lost like 6 speakers including my center speaker .....
When you see the show and you hear the stacatto tapping of the dancing shoes I can not believe that they released this DVD with one of the most important elements of the dance show being basically flat flat flat ....
The video production in this disc isn't much better than the audio. Flately was the exec film producer of this DVD and someone should have told the master that you need light to be able to film ...... The lighting tech on this DVD should have been fired on the spot .. its dark .. its brooding and has none of the sparkle that I certainly expected or saw in the show itself.
The jacket says it's got up to 4 channels of encoded audio as dolby digital surround sound. I'm not a sound tech by me and my equipment don't beleive this for one minute, and, of course, it's not in wide screen format, Im surprised they spend the money for colour....
If you have a small screen TV with no surround sound and no digital dolby but only the $ 1.95 cent speakers in your set then maybe you would like this DVD ... course for the life of me I really couldn't fihure out why you'd own a DVD player with that kind of equipment ....
Well Flatley you did it this DVD ranks as the worst and I mean the WORST I have ever seen ..... save your money folks spend it on a pint down at the local Irish pub ......",1011052800,10,1928,4.171581769436997
1240450,5,B00000K32N,"Michael Flatley truly is the Lord of the Dance (hereafter referred to as LOD).  This show is much better than the original Riverdance.  LOD is strictly focused on modern Irish dance, and the show plot is basically based on old Irish folklore involving the sweet Colleen and the tempting Gypsy trying to lure in Michael Flatley's character.  There are several numbers that are performed without any music, and you will be amazed at how incredible the taps sound.  Michael Flatley is as egotistical as they come, but he has reason to be!  Once he is on stage, you won't want to focus on anyone else. His tapping is showcased in several numbers.
If you are trying to decide between LOD or Feet of Flames, here are differences.  Personally, I like Feet of Flames better.
Feet of Flames (FOF) was filmed at Hyde Park in London.  The stage and set are much bigger than shown on the LOD.  In FOF, the music has been changed slightly and is more energetic.  There are newer and more interesting looking costumes.  Michael Flatley has a few more solos, including one where he is playing an instrument.  Of course, his costumes are more flashy in FOF.  I think FOF seems to flow better as the troupe is more experienced now.
My bottom line:  you won't go wrong with either FOF or LOD, but if you had to choose one, I would pick Feet of Flames.",1010102400,33,1333,4.504166666666666

Combining the lightening fast feet of Sammy Davis, and the rapacious wit of Gerry Adams, Michael truly elevates himself to LORD of the Dance.

Many other reviewers commented that there appears to be 2 different versions.  There is, or was, a Polygram version.  I have no clue if the Polygram version of this DVD is of better quality (or if Polygram is even part of the same company), but I do know that the Universal Studio guys should have expended more resources to AT LEAST get this DVD up to par with the version that PBS has shown.
