8021799,4,B000244F32,"Sailor Moon is a great series and really introduced America to anime which i believe this series helped FUEL America's addiction to anime. After the final 13 episodes of the 2nd season finished airing on TV it seemed all hope was lost to ever see the final 3 remaining seasons hit the US shore. Lucky for the fans after a few years since Sailor Moon R (Season 2) finished airing on TV word went ram pit that the 3 Sailor Moon movies were coming to the US dubbed/sub along with the Super and SuperS series hitting US waters as well with individual volumes being released month after month back to back. During these releases a phenomenon was taking place. VHS was starting to fade away and DVD was taking control front and center at a slow pace but definitely an evolution was happening. Anyways i had seen the entire series of Super and SuperS way before the official US release but i saw only the subtitled version. Super (Season 3) was a great series and in my opinion the best out of all the 5 seasons. I was so looking forward to the dubbed version only to hear the change in the lead actress which ruined everything. Despite a few changes in the cast and the remaining Japanese soundtrack on the episodes it's still a good watch for any Sailor Moon fan. Luckily these DVDs come with both English and Japanese audio. Season 4 SuperS is the weakest of all the series but it is one of the most beautifully animated series out of all the 5 along with Sailor Stars (Season 5). After an AWESOME season 3 I was anticipating season 4 heavily only to see that the Sailor Moon magic was gone. This set introduces us to the new villains of the season (Circus like villains), a unicorn named Pegasus with a secret, and the scouts new powers and transformations. This season revolves solely on Rini (Sailor Mini Moon) so as interesting as it sounded it kinda wasn't executed properly and Rini takes up a lot of screen time. The other scouts almost seem irrelevant in season 4. The writers of the show had a good concept for this season but it didn't translate well on screen. It's apparent when the season finale hits that fans were not pleased as there really wasn't any closure. So the beginning of season 5 consists of 6 episodes to close out the Pegasus saga story arc and bring more light to why Nefelenia was doing what she was doing. Check this out, it is discontinued and heavily over priced but it's worth it for any SM fan.",1207612800,2,2425,4.439461883408072
