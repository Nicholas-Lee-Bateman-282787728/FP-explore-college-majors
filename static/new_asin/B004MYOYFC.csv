4433987,5,B004MYOYFC,Each Murdoch series is better than the last one.  I particularly liked this one as his superior is finally supportive of him.  His being handsome doesn't hurt nor does his romance with the medical examiner.,1306886400,,206,4.857142857142857
4433988,5,B004MYOYFC,"I have watched the first four episodes of Season 3.  The writers and actors consistently deliver an entertaining, interesting and engaging show.  I highly recommend Season 3 for those folks that watched either Season 1 or 2.",1306713600,,224,5.027027027027027
4433989,5,B004MYOYFC,"Season three (3) of this splendid murder mystery/detective series that is set in Victorian Canada (mainly in the city of Toronto) is still so very good.  The wonderful Yannick Bisson, as Murdock is still very great as a very forward looking solver of crimes.  He is a very dedicated, sincere and very shy police detective that is very willing to use the  ""new"" science  of psychology, finger prints (called finger marks at that time) blood analyzes, etc., which were just being discovered , at the time,  that is depicted  in the series.  Again the pathologist (wonderfully played by Helene Joy) is on hand to supply a love interest for Murdoch, to help solve the crimes with her great scientific skills and knowledge and to give some ""Morgue Humor"" that always puts a look of shock on Murdoch's face--I adore her character.

This season three (3) of ""Murdoch Mysteries""  is greatly  directed and acted with some very good mysteries that kept me wondering until the end and ""all was revealed"" who ""done it""  There is not much visible gratuitous violence just some very good mysteries that are solved with the burgeoning science  of ""crime solving"" and by delightful characters that I have come to love including Murdock's boss that has no faith in the ""new"" ways of police investigation that Murdock depends on.  I am really looking forward to Season four (4).",1305331200,6,1360,4.8354978354978355

4433991,5,B004MYOYFC,"Not a review but a big HOORAY!!!!

Finally a stand alone release for Season 3.

The review: FANTASTIC.",1301875200,17,102,4.611111111111111
4433992,5,B004MYOYFC,"More 1890s Toronto cop investigation than romance, since Det. Murdoch is so romantically bashful. Comedy, mystery, adventure and romance unite perfectly in a Victorian setting based on Maureen Jennings novels. You get Victorian crime with contemporary evidence gathering techniques. Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) is a century ahead of his forensic sleuthing counterparts. Dr. Ogden (Helene Joy) is the gorgeous pathologist in the forensics search--the morgue maiden. Victorian 'sparks' happen between Murdoch and Dr. O, at his discretionary Victorian rate. Romantic chemistry cleverly woven into murder investigations. Insp. Brackenreid (Thomas Craig) ex-army & boss, plus Crabtree (Jonny Harris) ambitious right-hand man, are back in every episode. Guest stars a-plenty.

All episodes are police investigations with interesting new technology (new to the period) or science helping find clues. Marvelously inventive in plot and beautiful to view it the realistic Victorian era. Perfection in sets, costumes, and props. It's no wonder it is award grabbing (over 2 dozen to date) and still continues on TV.
It is murder situations, with some violence and blood (especially in Dr. O's morgue clue-gathering scenes), and multiple plot episodes. Highly recommended for the mystery, crime, and even Victorian romance fans.

Bonus of film presentations ""About Murdoch Mysteries"" ""Make-Up"" ""Costume Design"" & episode 13  ""The Tesla Effect Alternate Ending"" with all including subtitles.
Episodes have SDH SUBTITLES:
_._1 The Murdoch Identity- Murdoch, minus memory, is chased by gunmen & saved by a pub owner Anna (Lisa Faulkner-`Murder in Suburbia). A cop-temp, Hamish (Patrick McKenna-`Red Green Show') helps save the day. Interesting morgue view of a large diameter bullet hole clean through the cadaver's head.
_._2 The Great Wall- Station 4's Murdoch is summoned to St. 5 for a cop killing in China Town. A China Rx shop owner is accused but there is conflicting evidence.
_._3 Victor, Victorian- A new Freemason member is poisoned. Why does Dr. Ogden say the victim's ID is wrong? A Masonic nightmare?
_._4 Rich Boy, Poor Boy- Brackenreid's son is snatched. Was a purse snatcher involved in the kidnapping? Was another kid the intended victim? Very emotional.
_._5 Me, Myself and Murdoch- 60th birthday axe murder with the daughter (Anastasia Phillips) found holding the axe. Devil possession, amnesia, or schizophrenia? Dr. Roberts (Paul Ames) will find clues via hypnosis.
_._6 This One Goes to Eleven- Rembrandt's nude painting disappears from the elevator between floors leaving the guard dead. The case explodes into a forgery conspiracy. Owners, Sally (Kate Greenhouse) & James Pendrick (Peter Stebbings) are suspect and these guest stars will reappear in 3 later episodes in new/renewed plots.
_._7 Blood and Circuses- Death by circus tiger and the whole circus do a runner. All are arrested making Station 4 a circus. Crabtree as always gets in some good one-liners. Surprising results from Ogden's autopsy of trainer and tiger. Ivy lady (Ashley Leggat) & Lady Minerva (Lally Cadeau) are two guest stars playing circus stars.
_._8 Future Imperfect- Pendrick hosts a gathering for human selective breeding, eugenicists, attended by H.G. Wells and Ruby (Sarah Gadon) Dr. O's sis. Unfortunately a dog also attends carrying a severed human arm.
_._9 Love and Human Remains- 2 bodies found in peat at a building site. Death time is puzzling but the bodies cause a family reunion, including an old couple who once lived at the location; the Hastings (Myron Natwick) & (Joan Gregson). Death by cyanide, but how? Subplot finds Crabtree's cousin in town.
_._10 The Curse of Beaton Manor- Dead but pushed or jumped? Death by a ghost? Suspicious death is a habit at Beaton Manor, members played by guest stars William Godfrey, Jonathan Goad, Jordan Pettle, and Stephanie Langton.
_._11 Hangman- After his hanging the victim leaps off the autopsy table. Fox (Hardee T. Lineham) gave himself a tracheotomy to air. Other guest stars are Eric Peterson & Peter Donaldson. Murdoch is at the end of his rope on this case.
_._12 In the Alltogether- Strangulation in the park and risqu&eacute; postcards found of the victim leading to a pornographer (Ennis Esmer) studio. Sally Pendrick photos also found, oops. A return, but different look, at this guest star. Murder and blackmail while Ogden gets impatient with a romance subplot.
_._13 The Tesla Effect- Electrocution by microwave. Guest star Peter Keleghan is back as a govt. spy looking for a new weapon and Tesla (Dmitry Chepovetsky) is a returned guest to solve the puzzle of a cooked corpse. Crabtree hopes to test a yam. The Pendricks are back too, and Ogden is largely ignored in a returning subplot as she considers a new job in Buffalo.

You will want to check the listing for Murdoch Mysteries Series 1 & 2. Both highly recommended.",1300838400,43,4878,5.274131274131274

His colleagues in Toronto have no idea what's happened to him.

4434030,5,B004MYOYFC,"As I have already said, in previous MURDOCH reviews, I love this program.
Being a Catholic myself, I especially enjoy the way Murdoch intertwines his Faith with his investigations...not ""in your face"" but as a subtle guide to his ever-inquiring mind.
I would definitely watch this show again and again ~ adding here that, (altho' I appreciate his being Catholic and not afraid to show it) I love the methods he uses to solve crimes ~ inventions, reconstructions, ""putting himself there at the scene"", etc etc...very creative, very unusual yet effective, and ALWAYS with a firm grasp on the law.
If he were a real man, not a fictional character, he would still deserve that gold detective's badge...and I doubt that anyone else would disagree!!",1479254400,,743,4.952

And of course Julia and William are just the best couple. William being the brilliant detective and Julia his perfect forensic pathologist.
And what can be said for Thomas Brackenreid?  Another great character, ""me ol mucker"".(sp)",1469404800,,517,4.931034482758621

4434083,5,B004MYOYFC,"Wonderfully entertaining crime mystery series. Murdoch Mysteries takes place in the 1890's through the turn of the century. Murdock's brilliant mind deduces mysteries with help from his inventions along with his Constable Crabtree as a capable apprentice. Constable Higgins makes quirky references to ideas for the modern age from ideas he may have as it relates to the mystery at hand or the dignitary. If you like authentic costuming, crime mysteries and quirky good humor as the team from Station House 4 meet notables of the time such as H.G. Wells, Thomas Edison, Alexander Bell and others, this is a series worth viewing.",1469318400,,627,5.097087378640777

There is always a new invention incorporated into the story and the show tackles various hot society or religious subjects in a very non biased way. And the doctor is a very strong woman who matches wits with Detective Murdock. But, when will he propose to the lovely doctor?

Well, I guess I won't find out as half way through season 3, the show is no longer prime!  This is very annoying and as a prime subscriber, I will not pay for the shows!  It is not on Netflex and only season 7 is on U Tube.

4434178,5,B004MYOYFC,"This Canadian Broadcasting Company series is excellent and is still in production (currently on a season break).
This is season three of seven seasons with the first five seasons available free on Amazon Prime; each season has thirteen episodes.
Please note: the last episode of the fifth season is particularly well done and could be a culminating episode for the whole series, however, the series does continue.
The sixth season is available to be purchased on Amazon Prime as a complete season or by the episode; it can also be purchased on DVD from Amazon.
The seventh season is not available on Amazon Prime but is available on DVD (from Amazon).
Each episode has a good plot including action, suspense, romantic interest and good character interplay.
The program has well laid out scenery, period proper costumes, superior direction and smooth production.
This results in an overall excellent program portraying the trials and tribulations of a turn of the century Toronto Constabulary Detective.
Throughout the series notable characters with recognizable names (Henry Ford, Nicola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell among others) are interspersed.
The whole series is entertaining and well worth watching.

4434189,5,B004MYOYFC,"It is now day 8 and I am still watching Murdock Mysteries.  I fear I will run out of provisions before i reach the summit of season 4 but I press on.  My guide, known only as Prime, informs me that season 6 has yet to be released, which has dampened my spirits but not my resolve.

Amongst the group, William Murdock is the most vital to our journey.  Without Murdock and the weight of his name, I fear our expedition will come to an abrupt end.  And yet, as capable as Murdock is, he is subordinate to one Charles Brakenreid.  Although I respect both he and his mustache equally, his placement as leader of the group is questionable and I fear corruption may have had a hand in his placement.  If I do not make it to season 6, please investigate this.  George Crabtree, Murdock's faithful assistant, is a puzzle.  Although able to complete complex assignments in an impressive amount of time, Crabtree's reliance on erroneous advice from familial relations continue to hamper his professional advancement.  Julia Ogden, our teams doctor, is capable and professional.  However, I have begun to suspect that she and Murdock are intimately involved.  My intuition tells me that although they display affection openly, their relationship will never fully develop. One need only be reminded of the abrupt ends to the Mork and Mindy and Louis and Clark expeditions to surmise that this relationship will keep Murdock and Dr. Ogden at a proper distance.

Thus far the journey has been amazing and I fully endorse it.  For those who wish to undertake the same journey as I have, I implore you to NOT consult Wales and Sanger's Wikipedium on the subject as the journey will be much more enjoyable.  Begin watching this series in its entirety posthaste.",1408060800,,1744,4.728476821192053

4434223,5,B004MYOYFC,"This review is for Season 1 through Season 5.  I really love this series and can't believe it never made it to the US.  Murdoch is a scientific detective in  late 19th century Toronto.  This was an era when cultural views and ideas were changing rapidly.  Women's roles were changing as they sought out roles and jobs outside the home and science was progressing so rapidly that it seemed nothing was impossible.  Juxtaposed with this are questions of faith, love and honor; as well as some of the problems facing 21st century people,such as the wealthy being treated differently than the poor, immigration, government bureaucracy, and war in Africa.  Along the way the viewer meets some of the greatest names of the times, such as Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes) as well as a few of the premenient inventors of the times.  It's a view of a time we rarely see on television and I find it quite interesting, although I know it's not completely historically accurate.  I'm currently re-watching the series beginning with Season one and hoping that Season six will soon be on Prime.",1406764800,,1084,4.78494623655914

4434226,4,B004MYOYFC,"Season 3 of this historical mystery series set in late 1800s Toronto picks up where the previous season left off. The show combines cleverly plotted mysteries with forensic methods based on the science of the time, history and social issues that resonate even today.  This season's episodes maintain the high production values and good performances of Seasons 1 and 2. The science in some of the season's episodes is often a bit more of a stretch then it has been previously, though.  But the show doesn't take itself too seriously with humor even more prevalent than last season.  The interrelationships of the main characters--earnest, cerebral Det. William Murdoch; coolly efficient medical examiner Dr. Julia Ogden; irascible old-school Insp. Brackenreid; and eager but sometimes bumbling Constable Crabtree--remain enjoyable to follow. We streamed this series in HD from Amazon Prime on an Ethernet-connected Xbox 360, and the video and audio were flawless. Fans of science, history and mystery, interspersed with plenty of humor, should enjoy Murdoch Mysteries, Season 3.",1406160000,,1077,5.437125748502994

He uses or develops state of the art technology to assist in his catching the criminal.

Yannick Bisson does a great job as a smart detective who is dedicated to finding the truth, almost to a fault.  This show has everything that makes it worth watching - great stories and wonderful relationships among the characters.

4434284,5,B004MYOYFC,"This Victorian-era mystery series features the handsome and clever Detective William Murdoch solving crimes by using cutting edge forensic methods. Cutting edge for Victorian Canada that is, but familiar methods to modern crime-drama enthusiasts. Excellent performances by the cast, mainly Yannick Bisson as Murdoch, Helene Joy as Dr. Julia Ogden (a woman ahead of her time with a medical degree and the constabulary's pathologist), and Jonny Harris as Constable Crabtree. A delightful ensemble cast with good stories and intriguing mysteries. Guest appearances by such luminaries as Sir Winston Churchill, Nikola Tesla, Houdini, and other famous names of the period offer a delightful and intriguing glimpse into a time that is long past. Highly recommended for its high caliber performances and stories. Not too much gore for a detective series, and a little more romance for the reserved Detective Murdoch in this season!",1403568000,,924,5.514084507042254
4434285,5,B004MYOYFC,Family friendly show that is both entertaining and challenges your history knowledge.  The attention to detail of the costumes is tremendous.  Each episode I am amazed at how they have acquired some of the gadgets that often prove to be either real or very well re-produced.  A lot of work goes into these shows and we much enjoy their efforts.  Can't wain for the next season to be available.  Thanks for letting it be part of the Amazon Prime package.,1403481600,,453,4.6125
4434286,5,B004MYOYFC,"If you like period pieces with innovative plots and characters, this is the series for you.  Placed in 1890s Toronto, many crime solving techniques we use today were not available.  But leave it to the creative writers of Murdoch Mysteries to work ""inventions"" into the story line.  Like ""fingermarks"", ""deep water tracking devices"", ""night vision goggles"" , ""a lie detecting device"" and the list goes on and on.  William Murdoch is not only a brilliant detective and a ""science guy"" who can imagine how things work; he uses these insights to solve crimes.  The relationships between the main characters are delightful and ever changing.  Constable George Crabtree is Murdoch's right hand man.  Without him, Murdoch's job would be very difficult.  And while Murdoch is very straight laced and formal, George adds the comedic and fanatical to most investigations.  Dr. Julia Ogden is Williams love interest and multiple situations keep getting in the way of them truly being together.  Inspector Thomas Bradenreid is the head of Station House #4.  HIs English background brings a grittiness and authority which rounds out the 4 main characters in the wonderful and smartly written program.  This is a Canadian produced series and not easy to obtain in the US.  I actually got the first 5 seasons with my Kindle Prime but had to buy seasons 6 and 7 in DVD from Amazon.  The 8th season is being filmed this summer (2014) so will probably not be available in the US until sometime in 2015.",1403308800,,1485,4.911646586345381

There's warmth and humor woven into every tale and viewers get to see characters like Arthur Conan Doyle, Nikola Tesla and Harry Houdini interacting with members of the Toronto Constabulary.

An ending that combines the best sentiments of the 'Murdock Mysteries.' I'll leave this series here rather than chance disappointment in future seasons!

Think people that became famous, incidents built on legends and myths, now include cinematography and terrific acting . . . there are enough descriptive reviews so I'll just add, ENJOY!

4434391,5,B004MYOYFC,"Murdoch Mysteries is a cool idea that became much better as the cast began to gel by the middle of Season 1.  The mutual admiration / frustration / love interest between Murdoch and Dr Ogden takes center stage by the end of that season as is played to great effect in Season 2, which also introduces two plausible reasons they shouldn't logically be together.  While Season 2 tries to introduce a number of important social issues (both in the 1890s and now), Season 3 has a great combination of lightness and genius in its plots and dialog that really work.  The lack of development in the relationship between Murdoch and Ogden - the fact that they never discuss the future in a meaningful way - is not at all surprising and it keeps with Murdoch's character.  Even the final episode, where Ogden decides to leave for ""his sake"" forcing Murdoch to finally makes a decision, is in keeping with the overall arc of the previous seasons.

Unfortunately, the producers decided that keeping Murdoch and Ogden apart ended up becoming so important that they were willing to completely ignore their respective character's motivations in Season 4.  Supposedly Murdoch, having just missed Dr Ogden's train after buying her a ring and writing out his proposal speech just goes back to work for three months without contacting her.  Not even a letter!!!

This just would not have happened.  And it makes everything else that happens between them in Season 4 seem contrived and unrealistic.  When they don't get together in season 4 I started to get the feeling I did with lost: ""they don't care where this is going ,they just want to keep making shows.""

In terms of the Dr Ogden - Murdoch relationship, season 5 is actually better than season 4.  Unfortunately the mysteries in Season 5 are less inventive, and the interplay between the minor characters, with the exception of the new doctor, are so chummy that you have to wonder how realistic that would be.  Basically in Season 1 and most of 4 and 5, the show is tepid family fair.  Only a few of those episodes are as smart or sassy as season 3 or as politically relevant as Season 2.",1397520000,,2128,4.670241286863271

The setting is enjoyable, be it the police headquarters, the homes the crimes take place in, or just the beautiful countryside.  It's interesting to watch as details of the crimes & the suspects unfold.  A woman coroner adds a nice touch...she is quite insightful along with being Murdoch's love interest.

4434470,5,B004MYOYFC,I am thoroughly enjoying this series. The character development is wonderful.  The actors and actresses create such believable characters.  The ability of all of the actors to convey the story without using words is quite extraordinary.  All of the period work makes the story even more interesting. What a great way to learn about life at the turn of the twentieth century and how the people then were dealing with the same personal struggles that we all are facing today.

Since it takes place at he turn of the 20th century, is needed to be a little romantic. However, there's a very contemporary and forward-thinking scientific approach to the forensics that should appeal to those less inclined toward the last days of he Victorian era.

4434541,5,B004MYOYFC,"The series really is a lot of fun.  The characters are very well developed and you do get to know them pretty well.  Many times historical figures are woven into the story lines - Tesla, Conan-Doyle, Alexander Graham Bell, Houdini - and often they're given the chance to develop across a few episodes.  Murdock's romance with the coroner is a nice tease to further episodes.  Finally, the cinematography is stellar.

4434567,4,B004MYOYFC,"Murdoch Mysteries has become my favorite detective series. It is the perfect show for those of us who don't want breasts and blood in our faces, yet love the CSI perspective when it comes to the most awful of crimes: murder.

The show is set in late 19th century Toronto. Detective William Murdoch is a man of genius who is highly moral. Played by Yannick Bisson, one of the most gorgeous men you will find on TV, most women who watch the series fall immediately in love. Since the plot is set before the high tech age, Murdock must use his brain to figure out how to do elementary things, like get a set of fingerprints. He also ""invents"" a lie detector and a fax machine. In addition to using his own skills, Murdock relies on Dr. Julia Ogden, an ME who also uses her brain as many of the discoveries we take for granted are not available to these characters. That is what makes the show so very entertaining. That and the undercurrent love plot between Julia and William.

The supporting characters are just that: characters. Strong characters. George Crabtree, Murdoch's number 1, delights with his observations of the crime and people. The Inspector, Thomas Brackenreid, with his scotch always in hand, is another appealing character. I confess to a fondness for Brackenreid as I am a scotch drinker myself.

The other aspect of the show you may like is that historical characters are brought in periodically. Men like Nicola Tesla and Henry Ford, have crossed paths with Murdock.

If you are looking for a show you can absolutely share with the entire family, this is for you. There really is something for everyone in it:history, technology, romance, morality and intrigue . Amazon streams the first 5 seasons, so there's plenty of fun to be had. I'm just waiting for season 6 to become available so I can continue my love affair with William Murdoch.",1389830400,,1858,4.690184049079755
4434568,5,B004MYOYFC,"Started out well and improves by the season!  Hope it goes on for a long time!

4434569,5,B004MYOYFC,"I am now watching season 4 of season 6, if that tells you anything. This is a well written show, wonderful fleshed out characters, engaging plot lines - both per show and continuing series plot line, wonderful costumes. I now have my daughter hooked on Murdoch and we look forward to watching it. I watch a show a day and will be sad when I reach the end of season 6 not now knowing if it has been cancelled or if another season is in the works.

Each season has gotten better than the last and it has been great to see the growth of each character from season to season.  We like that it infuses historical characters and events into the show too.  we have really liked to see the inventions from the past that led to a lot of the current technologies and the use of social issues that have been infused into the show too.

4434604,5,B004MYOYFC,"Thanks to Amazon Prime I've discovered one of Canada's best. The writing is superb; first rate. It is a ""Period Piece""; set in Toronto @ the turn of the last century, w/ chatacters truly developed over the seasons. It is a mystery; but is also mixed w/ a bit of humor. The main Character Murdoch, played by Yannick Bisson, is one of Canada's finest actors. He brings a very believable sense of right and wrong, tempered w/ a true morality to the series.
My only complaint is that we do not have access to seasons 6 and 7; but I highly recommand it; it is a series you can sit w/ your children or grandchildren and not have to worry about what they will be viewing.",1388707200,,664,4.277777777777778

The main characters are great and seem to have a great working chemistry! I love the subtle hints of ""future"" inventions sprinkled throughout the series.  Like one day everyone will have their own portable phone to communicate with others and other such quips!  I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys good murder mysteries!",1388534400,,505,5.121951219512195
4434606,5,B004MYOYFC,This is a very good show that holds your interest as you realize most of his inventions are an early adaptation of modern technology.

4434608,5,B004MYOYFC,"My mother recommended this to me because she said it reminded her of ""Bones"", which I watch.  After watching, this show is so much better.  Dectetive Murdoch is brilliant in investigations and technical issues yet so inept when it comes to socialization and the combination is endearing.  Dr. Ogdon was just born in the wrong time.  The ""guests"" that show up are entertaining and it's fun to watch Murdoch ""fanboy"" over Tesla and Bell and the others.
This show is a hidden jewel and it's sad that not more people in America know about it.  I am trying to convert all my frends into fans of this show.",1388275200,,600,4.518518518518518

It is slow sometimes, but Victorian slow - as if you stepped into the late 1800's and were eavesdropping on stilted social interactions and police procedurals of the time.  Good detecting fun with embellished historical factoids and excellent chemistry between the regulars. Thanks, Canada!",1387238400,,399,5.762711864406779
4434642,5,B004MYOYFC,"I discovered Murdoch Mysteries on Ovation TV (under the name ""The Artful Detective""), where I doubt it will get much promotion and it will be very difficult for the U.S. audience to discover in the ""high numbers wasteland"" of cable TV. This series is a terrific mix of slightly-steampunk Victorian costume drama, MacGyver-tech police procedural, X-Files-meets-Scooby-Doo unmasking of the supernatural, and clever mysteries and secret histories sprinkled with quirky comic moments and all the struggles of true love. Murdoch Mysteries has the addictive quality of genre TV even as it defies or transcends all categories. It crosses the intelligence of British TV with the pacing and eye candy of American TV, and produces a miraculous hybrid.

Murdoch Mysteries is set in Toronto, which for most U.S. viewers will be the equivalent of another planet, but this isn't ""alienating"" at all - the time period is familiar enough that the location could be Any City in the Victorian Era. Better yet, this series is Mom-safe: the humor doesn't go near the toilet (though it often finds its way into the morgue) and the modernizing values are cloaked in old-fashioned courtesy. In fact, I bought this series for my Mom for Christmas, and I know she's going to love it. Yet there's plenty for younger demographics to enjoy, from clockpunk gadgets to shipping favorite couples. (Though I must admit that the show occasionally teeters into rather awkward fan service on the shipping front - I'd rather see the passionate kiss than Constable Crabtree musing on when those crazy kids will get together.) Also, there is enough ""angst"" and outright depressing turns of events to enthrall the moodiest of Millennials. What more can the sick-of-reality-TV jaded American TV watcher ask?

Murdoch Mysteries is now in its 7th season in Canada, where the show is a big hit and the quality remains high. I just hope it will somehow be discovered by American viewers soon so the syndication money will pour in, and this wonderful show will continue for years to come.",1387152000,,2043,5.041420118343195

Julia Ogden is a lady doctor who does the autopsies, an unusual occurrence for the time period. The episodes give us an insight into life at the end of the 19th century. I like the inclusion of historical characters such as Alexander Graham Bell, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Houdini to name a few.  The characters are well cast. Murdoch and Julia have great chemistry.

One cannot help but to support as well as sympathize with Detective Murdoch as he lives each episode and a mental superman whose desire for love and happiness remains just beyond his grasp, mostly because of his strong moral and mental posture.

4434658,5,B004MYOYFC,"This is a great series.  The writing in cleaver and they are able to weave current pop culture references into 1800's Canada.  I also like the ""Who Done It"" story lines and the introduction of new characters from time to time.",1384128000,,226,4.487804878048781
4434659,5,B004MYOYFC,"Murdoch takes place in the late 1800's (near the turn of the century) and on the cutting edge of forensics, in Toronto, Canada. The characters are great. The show is very well written and very well done.  I look forward to the next season. This series is at the top of the list for being one of my very favorites. Very enjoyable.  (Once in a while they get a little too graphic, as in doing an autopsy but it is acceptable to me, as the show is so well done.)  I would highly recommend this show.",1383868800,,496,4.145833333333333
4434660,4,B004MYOYFC,"I really enjoyed this series.  I watched all 7 seasons, although only 6 are on Amazon.  What I like the most is the blending of all the historical figures (Tesla, HG Wells, Ford, etc) within the story lines.  And, it is very steampunky!  I enjoy all the characters, but I have to say that George is so funny!  He makes comments that are so futuristic and everyone looks at him like....what are you thinking?  And of course, he's right -- microwaving a yam...so funny!",1383696000,,467,4.5
4434661,5,B004MYOYFC,Katie -This show is so well done! My daughters and I cannot get enough of it.  We love the music too.,1383696000,,101,3.8095238095238093
4434672,5,B004MYOYFC,"I am so impressed with this series. Murdoch Mysteries is well scripted and brings the 19th century values into each episode. Well mannered gentlemen and emerging women rights is touched upon in every episode. Historic characters are included with ease i.e. Arthur Conan Doyle, Jack London, Wild Bill Hickock and Henry Ford to name a few. I never want it to end but alas I have come to the last season and am not looking forward to the final episode.",1383523200,,449,4.625
4434673,5,B004MYOYFC,i wish someone in the US would produce a quality show like this. The premis of a 1900's detective is genius.,1383523200,,108,4.190476190476191
4434674,5,B004MYOYFC,"Love it.  The sets and costuming are kind of contrived for the period and the speech is different from today's stuff, but really very true to the period and very interesting.  Wish they were on in the US.",1383436800,,204,4.342105263157895
4434675,5,B004MYOYFC,Quite honestly I thought that any show based on 1800s era would have been boring- I am hooked and have watched all 5 seasons.  Looking forward to season 6.  Excellent show,1383436800,,171,4.483870967741935
4434676,5,B004MYOYFC,Well thought-out mysteries set in an era of human culture and growth that very little is shown on TV. Bravo!!!,1383350400,,110,4.55
4434677,5,B004MYOYFC,"The series on DVD exceeded the airing by Ovation Network (US) because it included scenes omitted by the TV airing. If you like Murdoch & Julia, you'll love it. If you like Crabtree and the Inspector, you'll love it.",1383177600,,215,4.538461538461538

4434679,5,B004MYOYFC,"Set around 1900, the characters exhibit a politeness, decorum and language skills which seem to be absent today and certainly in modern TV shows. The stories are focused, with minimal clutter and complex enough to intrigue me. All the characters are likable and entertaining while the story moves with a Poirot-like feel.",1383091200,,321,5.1923076923076925

4434684,4,B004MYOYFC,"Love a good, old fashioned mystery! With this series you get that, and some real history as well. some real life figures from history make appearances, and while that is fiction, what you learn about these people is real. I would recommend that parents watch episodes before allowing children to watch, as some episodes deal with sex, contraception, and abortion.",1382140800,,363,5.066666666666666
4434685,4,B004MYOYFC,"Events take place in a police building erected in 1899 and in many cases depict what may be the first use of more modern police methods such as finger-prints, dye used to identify stolen paper money and night vision.  The location is Canada and Murdock's superior officer is anti-monarchy.  There is a five season romance that doesn;t interfere with too many episodes.  Murdoch is an acceptable alternative to the typical American ""shoot-'em-up"" and ""auto chase"" crime diet.",1382140800,,474,5.12987012987013

I find the mysteries to be cleaverly devises, and the evolution of science used in police work to be interesting. I like the use of artistic license with some historic fact and the roles of men and women. It's just a good series. Very happy I found it, and even more happy I can see it when I want thru Prime......",1379980800,,403,4.17948717948718

4434711,5,B004MYOYFC,"Any season of Murdoch Mysteries promises to be great.  Excellent writing, wonderful acting, perfect settings,  all one could ask for.  American television should take note of a show that doesn't need nasty spoiled children, lewd innuendos and anorexic women to be a hit.

His sidekick is always projecting Murdoch's ideas into the future--which, of course, have come true in many cases. Intriguing and always interesting.

4434782,5,B004MYOYFC,Very entertaining and lots of fun to watch how the forensic vocabulary we are used to today is worked into the script for that period of time.  I think the off again - on again romance between Murdoch and Ogden is wearing a little thin by the end of this season.  Maybe there will be a resolution of the relationship in Season 4.,1376092800,,329,4.2063492063492065

4434784,5,B004MYOYFC,"Oh this was a surprising start to a new season - Murdoch inexplicably in Europe with amnesia! Hmm. An unexpected swerve from the relationships that had been developing. The writers of this show are really great. Interest does not dwindle as the seasons go on (as with some shows)...they keep catching me off guard - and keep me engaged - with unexpected threads of the story. I love these characters, just the filming and costuming is a pleasure to watch and Murdoch is more endearing all of the time. (Who is this actor, and why have I not seen him in anything else!)

I came across this series by accident and once I started watching I couldn't stop for many days till I had gone thru series 1-5 completely. Watched very little tv programs except the news and weather until I completed season 5. Had to find season 5 on youtube and subcribe to acorntv. They do offer a week free for $5 a month and carry many up to date UK shows. You can cancel at anytime. Wish amazon carried Season 5 and 6 so I didn't have to search elsewhere.

The character development, in my opinion, is great.  When I watch a show, I'm usually drawn to a particular character.  However, in this case, I don't have a favorite.  All the characters are well developed.  Even though each episode can stand alone and is interesting, you have a greater appreciation for the underlying story by seeing them develop as the show progresses.  Overall, this show goes down in my book as one of my alltime favorites.",1374883200,,619,4.838095238095238

4434808,5,B004MYOYFC,Great entertainment with a new approach to standard mystery stories.  Inclusion of historical figures adds a lot to the context.,1374624000,,128,5.4
4434809,5,B004MYOYFC,"From the first episode of this show my wife and I were hooked--intriguing stories, interesting characters, top-notch acting.  What you'll really enjoy is the absolutely intriguing integration of 1890s, edge-of-modern technology into the stories.  Many episodes are edgy but not not overly dark.  This is a Canadian masterpiece featuring self-contained episodes laced with an interesting back-story.  Marvelous!",1374624000,,410,6.140350877192983
4434810,5,B004MYOYFC,"This is one of the best detective mystery shows I have seen in a long time. I have become so BORED with reality TV shows.
This is not one of those whodunits that you can not figure it out in the first five minutes. This is very well thought-out and written.
I love the setting of the late 1900's.",1374451200,,296,4.033898305084746

4434822,4,B004MYOYFC,A murder mystery with comic relief and a touch of education thrown in.  It is interesting to think of the inventions of the time and how different things were...but what remains constant through time are the motives for murder.,1374451200,,227,4.82051282051282

4434824,5,B004MYOYFC,"Love the whole Murdoch series. They don't follow the books, rather they borrow the characters and some of the plots. My wife enjoyed both the books and the series. I've only seen the video version, but unless you're someone that insists on the videos being true to the books I think you'll enjoy the Murdoch series.",1374192000,,315,4.642857142857143

4434827,5,B004MYOYFC,"Enjoyable inventive plots, characters that are engaging and all around a great detective series. Inspector Murdoch has a gift of insight but not to the degree of being able to suss out the bad guy psychically- just glimpses of what has happened. I love it's setting - maybe late 1800s? I also love it that the forensic physician is a female and there is a budding romance between she and Murdoch.",1373846400,,396,4.591549295774648
4434828,5,B004MYOYFC,We have series 1-5 and love them all and we will buy series 6 as soon as it's released. You must buy them all to follow the ups and downs of Murdoch's romance with the pretty lady Doctor.  It is a hoot the way they bring in historical figures of that era and work them into the mysteries. I really liked the episode about Jack London and I had him pegged from the start. My husband and I have 80 year old hearing so the SDH subtitles are really appreciated.,1373760000,,457,4.0777777777777775

4434859,5,B004MYOYFC,This series is a pleasure to watch.  I'm addicted.  So refreshingly uncomplicated.  I have become very familiar with the characters and find each one of them very likeable.  Detective Murdoch is not only a detective but formidable in all scientific aspects of investigation.  Dr. Ogden is not only beautiful and a scientific match for Murdoch but the apple of his eye.

I get to think a little about history (with characters like Alexander Graham Bell, etc) and how certain inventions might have come about, but it's couched in the form of a concise little mystery. I also love the characters. I'm a sucker for any series when I can feel like I ""know"" the characters, and this is one such series.",1365811200,,463,4.32183908045977

Once the full series has been watched this viewer finds he is talking to the screen telling Murdoch to tell the doctor he loves her. This series has been threatened with cancelation.

I find the details of the clothing, furniture, language, machinery, etc. remarkable. It makes you stop and wonder if that is how some of the items we take for granted were invented. The tension between Dr. Ogden and Inspector Murdoch is wonderful. I like the series so much that I intend to buy the 5th year today.

At this point, the mysteries grow in complexity, pulling from science, business, the arts.  Murdoch and Dr. Ogden are an item that is no longer a secret to the precinct although i doubt it was ever much of a secret.  Constable Crabtree moves more into the foreground as does Inspector Breckenreid.  Personally speaking, this is the season I became a fan.",1364342400,,457,4.548780487804878

4434962,2,B004MYOYFC,I have thoroughly enjoyed the Murdoch Mysteries but was disappointed in the Third season.  The stories were much more forced and seemed to have an adjenda. Doctor Ogden is an amazing character but I was glad to see her go.  The mysteries and the science was lost and not much was given to replace it.  I currently have the first two seasons and will get the Fourth season which is back up to par.  Hopefully Third season is just an aberration.,1360713600,,443,4.432098765432099
4434963,5,B004MYOYFC,"We enjoy the series a lot but had some problems with the streaming for one of the episodes. Watched one that went fine, next one would not stream to the tv but the third one did. Went to Netflix to watch the one that would not play thru Amazon and it played fine thru Netflix. Another side comment concerns Amazons episode description, so far we do not see a way to get a detailed description , there is a brief comment but no more. Netfilx has a much more detailed description. We would prefer to use Amazon. The main question here was how we liked the Murdoch series, We enjoy it and will watch all the episodes, just not sure it will always be thru Amazon.",1360713600,,659,4.238095238095238

4434966,5,B004MYOYFC,"This Canadian program is not shown in the US, at least as far as I know, so the only way to see it is by purchasing or borrowing the DVDs. It is well worth it. This mystery series is set in Toronto in the 1890s and features a detective who uses cutting edge (for the time) science to solve his cases. It has a lot of humor and romance. His forward thinking ways echo the techniques we are all used to from shows like CSI or Criminal Minds. He goes to a psychologist for a 'profile', he hooks up several telegraph offices to help catch a 'cyber stalker' etc.",1359244800,,557,4.1192660550458715

4434974,5,B004MYOYFC,"The Murdoch Mysteries came to my attention while visiting Vancouver, B.C. this August.  While packing in my hotel room, I turned on the television to view a rerun of Murdoch Mysteries; I was immediately taken in by the incredible costumes, scenery, plot, excellent acting and characters, especially Detective Murdoch.  It is very well written for TV.  An incredibly well-acted TV series, it captures the imagination of turn-of-the-century North America, with the latest, forward thinking science available, especially from Det. Murdoch, and the viewer can hardly wait for the next episode.  The history of invention is interwoven into almost every episode, e.g. finger printing, the telephone, electromagnetic energy (wireless communication), AC electricity, etc. I have seen Seasons 1 and 3 so far (and have Season 4), all on Blu-Ray, waiting for Season 2 on Blu-Ray which for some odd reason, was not released on Blu-Ray with Seasons 1, 3 & 4 (I have been assured that all future seasons will be released on Blu-Ray at the about the same time as DVD).  Season 2 is to be released on Blu-Ray in the spring, and Season 5 (last telecast in Canada in late August 2012) will also be released together, on Blu-Ray and DVD in the spring. Season 6 was picked up by Canadian TV (after being dropped by the previous studio) and is just about complete, with the first telecast in Canada scheduled for January 2013.  The series amazingly (so far) does not become stagnant, but picks up to even greater levels in acting, scenery, plot and interest of the characters in Season 3 from Season 1, and the ending is really spectacular with Detective Murdoch narrowly missing his attempt to become engaged to Doctor Ogden.  Some of the plots become incresingly complicated, and some villains carry over into several episodes before the truth about them becomes apparent.  I only wish I could watch Seasons 1, 2 & 3 in order, but am unwilling to purchase DVD when Blu-Ray makes such a viewing difference on large screen, 16:9 aspect, 1080p television screens, especially given the beautiful costumes and spectacular scenery.  Most of the episodes seem to be recorded in the late spring, summer and early fall months since I see very few scenes with snow.  Filming is in and around Tornoto.  I haven't been this addicted to a murder mystery series since Peter Falk as Columbo.  Too bad the Murdoch Mysteries is not televised in the US (one season was broadcast on PBS I think, but unfortunately the series was not renewed for some reason). Great show, entertaining, if somewhat gory at times showing pictures of the corpse, autopsies, etc. I have no seen the Murdoch Mysteries movie series which preceded the television series by the same name; it has completely different characters and is not available on Blu-Ray.",1349740800,5,2797,4.952991452991453
4434975,5,B004MYOYFC,Hope they do another season I will buy it for sure.  It was funny and interesting.  The history tht you take away from this era is delightful,1348531200,,141,4.185185185185185
4434976,4,B004MYOYFC,Love the concept of a Canadian style Mr. Monk.  Straight Laced Detective Murdoch is a genius of all things scientific and forensic.,1340841600,,131,4.954545454545454

4434978,5,B004MYOYFC,"Maybe it's their traditionally close ties to Great Britain, but the Canadians just seem to be producing better and better television series. I first became a fan of the immortal Red Green show and now Murdoch Mysteries has proven itself another jewel, ranking in my estimation with New Tricks and that's saying a lot. The Canucks are raising the bar for entertainment, maybe someday the moguls in American television will start paying attention.",1332028800,,445,5.109589041095891
4434979,5,B004MYOYFC,"Absolutely love this show!  I've only seen two seasons so far, but the writing and acting just gets better and better.  Of course, Yannick Bisson (Murdoch )is wonderful but Thomas Craig is incredible!  Ending to season 2 was terrific - Ogden and Murdoch totally in character.  Appreciate that they tackle some difficult topics - as well being educational about state-of-art forensics and pyschology.",1330646400,,399,5.285714285714286
4434980,5,B004MYOYFC,"I have to admit I have been quite taken with the British murder mysteries lately.  I started with a set of Inspector Lewis after seeing one episode on Masterpiece Theatre.  Then I went to Miss Marple, Poirot, and Midsomer Murders.  Having been so pleased with the previous selections I tried Murdoch Mysteries most recently, and was delighted with the turn of the century Victorian setting and the chemistry between Murdoch and the adorable female medical examiner.  I find it amusing that it's not uncommon in British Murder Mysteries, to have two or three murders in one episode.  They don't seem to be surprised...""It's all in a days work.""  Detective Murdoch has invented many primitive  examples of modern day criminal testing equipment.  I have enjoyed this series so much I now have Seasons One, Two and Three.  I don't think you would be disappointed.",1327708800,,859,4.951048951048951
4434981,5,B004MYOYFC,Set in Montreal near the turn of the 20th century. Lot's of interesting historical characters show up and the mysteries are well crafted. Interesting inter-play between the Victorian mores and the rapid progress in the early 1900's. I have all three seasons and can't wait for season 4.,1327190400,,286,4.979166666666667
4434992,5,B004MYOYFC,"More 1890s Toronto cop investigation than romance, since Det. Murdoch is so romantically bashful. Comedy, mystery, adventure and romance unite perfectly in a Victorian setting based on Maureen Jennings novels. You get Victorian crime with contemporary evidence gathering techniques. Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) is a century ahead of his forensic sleuthing counterparts. Dr. Ogden (Helene Joy) is the gorgeous pathologist in the forensics search--the morgue maiden. Victorian 'sparks' happen between Murdoch and Dr. O, at his discretionary Victorian rate. Romantic chemistry cleverly woven into murder investigations. Insp. Brackenreid (Thomas Craig) ex-army & boss, plus Crabtree (Jonny Harris) ambitious right-hand man, are back in every episode. Guest stars a-plenty. There will NEVER be too many episodes of this exciting/fun TV series.

All episodes are police investigations with interesting new technology (new to the period) or science helping find clues. Marvelously inventive in plot and beautiful to view it the realistic Victorian era. Perfection in sets, costumes, and props. It's no wonder it is award grabbing (over 2 dozen to date) and still continues on TV.
It is murder situations, with some violence and blood (especially in Dr. O's morgue clue-gathering scenes), and multiple plot episodes. Highly recommended for the mystery, crime, and even Victorian romance fans.

Bonus of film presentations ""About Murdoch Mysteries"" ""Make-Up"" ""Costume Design"" & episode 13 ""The Tesla Effect Alternate Ending"" with all including subtitles.
Episodes have SDH SUBTITLES:
_._1 The Murdoch Identity- Murdoch, minus memory, is chased by gunmen & saved by a pub owner Anna (Lisa Faulkner-`Murder in Suburbia). A cop-temp, Hamish (Patrick McKenna-`Red Green Show') helps save the day. Interesting morgue view of a large diameter bullet hole clean through the cadaver's head.
_._2 The Great Wall- Station 4's Murdoch is summoned to St. 5 for a cop killing in China Town. A China Rx shop owner is accused but there is conflicting evidence.
_._3 Victor, Victorian- A new Freemason member is poisoned. Why does Dr. Ogden say the victim's ID is wrong? A Masonic nightmare?
_._4 Rich Boy, Poor Boy- Brackenreid's son is snatched. Was a purse snatcher involved in the kidnapping? Was another kid the intended victim? Very emotional.
_._5 Me, Myself and Murdoch- 60th birthday axe murder with the daughter (Anastasia Phillips) found holding the axe. Devil possession, amnesia, or schizophrenia? Dr. Roberts (Paul Ames) will find clues via hypnosis.
_._6 This One Goes to Eleven- Rembrandt's nude painting disappears from the elevator between floors leaving the guard dead. The case explodes into a forgery conspiracy. Owners, Sally (Kate Greenhouse) & James Pendrick (Peter Stebbings) are suspect and these guest stars will reappear in 3 later episodes in new/renewed plots.
_._7 Blood and Circuses- Death by circus tiger and the whole circus do a runner. All are arrested making Station 4 a circus. Crabtree as always gets in some good one-liners. Surprising results from Ogden's autopsy of trainer and tiger. Ivy lady (Ashley Leggat) & Lady Minerva (Lally Cadeau) are two guest stars playing circus stars.
_._8 Future Imperfect- Pendrick hosts a gathering for human selective breeding, eugenicists, attended by H.G. Wells and Ruby (Sarah Gadon) Dr. O's sis. Unfortunately a dog also attends carrying a severed human arm.
_._9 Love and Human Remains- 2 bodies found in peat at a building site. Death time is puzzling but the bodies cause a family reunion, including an old couple who once lived at the location; the Hastings (Myron Natwick) & (Joan Gregson). Death by cyanide, but how? Subplot finds Crabtree's cousin in town.
_._10 The Curse of Beaton Manor- Dead but pushed or jumped? Death by a ghost? Suspicious death is a habit at Beaton Manor, members played by guest stars William Godfrey, Jonathan Goad, Jordan Pettle, and Stephanie Langton.
_._11 Hangman- After his hanging the victim leaps off the autopsy table. Fox (Hardee T. Lineham) gave himself a tracheotomy to air. Other guest stars are Eric Peterson & Peter Donaldson. Murdoch is at the end of his rope on this case.
_._12 In the Alltogether- Strangulation in the park and risqu postcards found of the victim leading to a pornographer (Ennis Esmer) studio. Sally Pendrick photos also found, oops. A return, but different look, at this guest star. Murder and blackmail while Ogden gets impatient with a romance subplot.
_._13 The Tesla Effect- Electrocution by microwave. Guest star Peter Keleghan is back as a govt. spy looking for a new weapon and Tesla (Dmitry Chepovetsky) is a returned guest to solve the puzzle of a cooked corpse. Crabtree hopes to test a yam. The Pendricks are back too, and Ogden is largely ignored in a returning subplot as she considers a new job in Buffalo.
