1354456,3,B00004U5RZ,"This movie was editted, but I got the jest of the director's point of view. The movie centers around Adrien Body's character who has just been dumped. He is a beginning screenplay writer who works at a restaurant to pay the bills until he is successful. All the character's work at the restaurant. They vary in races and the premise is how they get along with each other.

They movie is okay. I love Adrien Brody, so it was no big deal to watch him. He is a great actor and this role fit him. Elise Neal did a great job as a aspiring singer and his love interest. They movie was good, but not great. It lacked something, that I can' quite put my finger on. It had enough stars with Simon Baker, Lauryn Hill, Brody, and Neal, but something was missing. It is a movie I will watch again.",1175731200,,785,4.198675496688741
1354457,5,B00004U5RZ,"This heart-wrenching drama focuses on aspiring writer Chris Calloway, played soulfully by Adrien Brody. His past love with an African-American women, played by the exquisitely beautiful Lauryn Hill, haunts his present life, interfering with his artistic creativity, friendships, and current lover. Shadows of racism hinder his ability to truthfully love, truthfully write, and truthfully live.
As we watch Chris and his friends pinball between the things they want to do, and the things they need to do, we begin to relive our own painful experiences in the field of love.
Tensions rise as Chris grasps to make decisions that will forever affect his happiness, for better, and for worse.
Adrien Brody, Elise Neal, Simon Baker, & Lauryn Hill give memorable performances.",1060905600,14,769,5.363636363636363

1354459,4,B00004U5RZ,"Don't they just seem to have more flava :~).  Well in my opinion, this no different.  This well rounded cast makes for a nice ensemble in a resteraunt setting.  It is really neat to see how each of the primary characters deal with their aspirations, hidden demons and lost loves.
Adrian Brody is really good in this movie.  He plays his characters complexities very well.  I would really like to see him in more upcoming movies. Malcolm Jamal-Warner is great as well as Elise Freeman.  It is definitely worth a look-see.  Again, I am a sucker for a good independent film, so you may say I am biased ;~).  See it for yourself and you be the judge.",1005091200,,646,4.415254237288136
1354460,4,B00004U5RZ,"A terrific inner city tale with a diverse group of young adults trying to make it in the ""industry"". With their ""Restaurant"" job as the setting. Love, friendship, betrayl and racism, are all seen here  with painful reality. Adrien Brody and Malcolm Jamal-Warner are great in the  lead roles. One flaw, too may characters, not enough time. Overall good  movie.",960940800,4,359,4.95

1354463,3,B00004U5RZ,This movie was censored and I found that to be disappointing and distracting as I watched it.  The movie itself was pretty good but not great.,1389312000,,142,4.461538461538462
1354464,3,B00004U5RZ,"If you ar craving the early works of Simon Baker and want to see how The Mentalist actor got his start, then check out this flick. Story is kinda lame but you can see early flashes of brilliance from Baker and Adrien Brody.",1363478400,,223,4.209302325581396
1354465,5,B00004U5RZ,"I watch all of Adrien Brody's movies. He is always interesting to watch. I was surprised to see so many actors that I recognize for other hit movies/TV shows. I use to work in Jersey City myself, so It felt very real. A day in the life of people who work in a restaurant and eventually have to grow up to become responsible and persue their dream.",1358726400,,347,4.1940298507462686
1354466,5,B00004U5RZ,"What an amazing cast, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Adrien Brody is brilliant but that really goes without saying. One of the best movies I've seen in some time, a real must see, I know that sounds clique but it really is an great flick.",1334016000,,238,4.431818181818182
1354467,4,B00004U5RZ,"I am a great fan of Simon Baker. He is so good at seemingly actually becoming the person he portrays. So many actors just portray themselves, although they can be quite good at that. This is one of Baker's earlier films when he was still calling himself Simon Baker-Denny. It's a small part but he carries it off so well! Beyond that, the story is really interesting, with excellent performances throughout. It is kind of a shock to see the views of the New York skyline with the World Trade Center towers still intact. A sad reminder of the destruction to come. I rated this at 4 stars only because there wasn't enough of Simon Baker's character for me, although it was enough for the story. I could spend the entire time just watching Baker watch paint dry. Sheesh! he's good!",1317168000,,778,4.524822695035461
1354468,3,B00004U5RZ,"It was not horrible, but this movie was really cheesy and had no substantial plot. I was rather disappointed. It was worth seeing but only if you get it for a very low price or catch it on t.v.",1198972800,,193,3.9743589743589745
1354469,2,B00004U5RZ,This movie was very boring and I dint follow the plot at all. I love seeing white men and black women together thats the main reason I watched it.,1190678400,,146,4.068965517241379
1354470,5,B00004U5RZ,"Bought for only $1.00 at Wal-Mart.  Was expecting a poorly made independent film, but was pleasantly surprised by this film.  Part romance, mix in a little comedy, a little racial tension and a stellar cast, and you get a good story that is completely watchable and believable.  I especially like that the movie ended with the romantic leads going their separate ways, possibly to reunite later.  Added a realistic touch.

This was probably the movie before some of these actors hit the big time.  Nicely done.",1178409600,2,510,4.872093023255814

7923697,1,B00004U5RZ,"Please be forewarned, the videos for sale of this film on Amazon are needlessly and ineptly edited. (I have bought two in the hopes of finding an un-edited version) All swear words, visual and even spoken references to a major character's pregnancy as well as plot-defining utterances of the N-word have been removed. I know because I worked on this original film and once owned an unedited copy. As it is now, the film is incoherent. Clearly pirated from a television broadcast on the Family Channel or some such restrictive venue. AAARRGH!!!",1512432000,,543,4.913043478260869
7923698,4,B00004U5RZ,"""Restaurant"" is a slice of life film revolving around the joys and sorrows of employees at a restaurant. The prevalent themes include alcohol and drug abuse, love triangles, friendships, and racism. So while there is no cohesive overarching plot, you're basically catching a glimpse into the characters' everyday lives. I can't say it's an exciting movie where you're interested to see what happens next, but you do get emotionally invested in the characters and find yourself rooting for them, hoping they make up with their friends, that their romantic endeavors work out, and that they get that big promotion.

An ""R"" rating seems unwarranted because this film appears to have been edited for TV, even though this is a DVD release. I only heard one instance of cursing and the word was muted, and when one character raised his middle finger at another, his whole hand was blurred. I would say this is more of a PG-13 rating based on the depictions of drugs, alcoholism, brief violence, and prostitution; there is no nudity, sex, or swearing.

I would recommend this to people who enjoy shows like ""Felicity.""",1497916800,,1111,4.935828877005347
