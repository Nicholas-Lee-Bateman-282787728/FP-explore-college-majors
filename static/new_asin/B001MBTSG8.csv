Thank you Mr. B. (after seeing this debate, I purchased
Cherne's biography, Rescuing the World: The Life and Times of Leo Cherne).

This was an in depth, intelligent discussion re: McCarthyism.

So sad we no longer have these type of forums (or much interest in having them).",1366934400,,321,4.614035087719298
8320938,5,B001MBTSG8,"I've heard lots of things about McCarthysm.  Most notably its evils in its relentless pursuit of communists in places and people where there were none.  Here I witnessed my favorite erudite tackle what is ostensibly an all around American statesman who was relentlessly grilled and raked over the coals by the hunt for communists lead by Senator McCarthy.

Buckley defends the effort citing that the House of Un-American Activities, also known as HUAC, was founded in 1938 to pursue parties that may have had, as the name suggests, Un American aims, and specifically those supporting communism.  But the methods of inquisition were juvenile at best, reprehensible at worst.

But, Buckley, because of his anti-communist stance (one I share) and his belief in the uprightness of those who had ascended to power in the political bureaucracy, invested his heart and soul into this organization, and supported its efforts.  An act he later recanted and denounced after discovering for himself the abuses of Joe McCarthy.

It's not a pretty episode to watch.  It's one of the more energetic installments of firing line.  This was when the nation was in peril and confronted another nation, the Soviet Union, who were just as paranoid and fearful a power like the United States to challenge its own position in the world.  Hence the creation of the Eastern Bloc, and the strident efforts to expand its own influence around the world.

In this installment of Firing Line Buckley resists the urge to leap out of his chair and get in the face of his guest as he asks questions and rebuts the answers.  I've rare seen Buckley so animated, not since his time with Gore Vidal whom he threatened to physically attack live on the air after a grievous insult.

It's somewhat sad to see one of your heroes take the wrong side in a debate, but it is enlightening as it shows the time and kind of fear that gripped the nation.  Buckley, even though he sided with the wrong benefactors, is again astute in his facts and interrogation.

Definitely worth seeing.",1355356800,,2040,4.838616714697406
8320939,4,B001MBTSG8,This episode considers the reactions of McCarthyism and the false and real claims.  The overreactions of those seeking to discredit McCarthy who was proven right in his pursuit but perhaps not in his methods.,1353283200,,208,5.117647058823529
8320940,5,B001MBTSG8,A particularly good episode of a great show.  Buckley is in fine Firing Line form as is his guest.  Imagine that.  Once upon a time a talk show host actually engaged in intelligent conversation with guests with whom he disagreed.  Man oh man -- such a concept!  An intellectual feast!,1229472000,4,284,4.6
