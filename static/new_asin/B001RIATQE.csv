8338045,4,B001RIATQE,"I purchased this dvd for my 4 year old daughter, who just started gymnastics this year.  It's a really helpful dvd, and the coach is great.  Her instructions are clear, you can easily see each skill the kids are performing, and I like it how she stopped to make a point of how to work on building up the correct body shape etc for each skill, so kids at home can really understand what they need to do (and probably more importantly, so numpty parents like me can help!!).

The one drawback with this dvd is that some of the skills require a beam and bars - fine, if you have your own at home.  You probably also need a mat or two.  The other skills are really helpful, though, and my daughter really enjoyed the pace of the dvd - and learning a little bit more about each skill.

Highly recommend it - even without your own bar and beam.  There is still plenty to practice.  (Though a bar and beam would help!)",1378684800,2,911,4.195402298850575
8338046,1,B001RIATQE,"I was looking for a DVD that explained the different gymnastic positions and how to do it so my daughter could practice the positions she learnt in class the correct way at home. This isn't it. This DVD is basically a DVD of mostly preschool kids and it just goes fast through some warm ups and then rolling on inclined mat. If it explained the basic positions like straddle,pike, tuck,table,bridge etc and how to do it step by step it would have been good. Instead it assumes that the kid knows straddle, pike etc. It is hard for children to follow along as it goes fast and  can get frustrating. For the price of $30 I expected better content. This is way over priced and not presented in a way kids can follow. Also it uses gymnastic equipment like inclined mat and all and is not at all useful for a home user. There are so many exercises and positions to strengthen the arms and legs without the use of gym equipment and that is not shown in this DVD. This has been a worthless purchase for me.",1377734400,12,999,4.3138297872340425
8338047,5,B001RIATQE,"She thought the girl on front looked too babyish for her to watch this DVD.  Didn't think she would learn anything, but it's a great DVD.  Daughter surprisingly enjoys DVD and practices what she's watching.",1374883200,,206,4.857142857142857
8338048,3,B001RIATQE,"I thought this would be a little more instructional. It is mostly just a video of children doing gymnastics.
My granddaughter who is 7 liked it. The 11 year old thought it was for babies.",1357689600,,187,4.371428571428571
8338049,4,B001RIATQE,"I was looking into purchasing a video that would help me teach my daughter how to practice what she was learning in class at home.  I reviewed several of the videos before choosing this one.  It is for the beginner gymnast and do not recommend it to any gymnast in level 3 or beyond, but for my level 2 gymnast it was helpful.  She reviews many skills for preschoolers, as well as for 5 & 6 years olds.  We found the progression of skills to be very helpful, particularly for the floor exercises.  It is difficult to do many of the exercises unless you have all the equipment in your home.  We don't.  We have since purchased a mat, but used those letter cubes that were for my younger children to give my 6 year old a better surface to practice on.

Overall I think this DVD is expensive for what it offers, but am happy with the purchase and level of activities.

This would also be ideal for a gymnastic coach looking to working with young children, as it really breaks down all the skills.",1356480000,10,993,4.295698924731183
