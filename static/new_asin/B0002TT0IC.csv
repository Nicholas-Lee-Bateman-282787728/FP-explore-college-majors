8031712,5,B0002TT0IC,"Yes Will Keenan is in this, but Love Rome must be watched for the vignette which depicts a couple discussing having a child six months after September 11th, 2001.

Love Rome is comprised of four vignettes about couples grappling with their own self-centered whims and fancies, while struggling to figure out how they feel about Sept 11th.

It's six months later, and New York is cleaning up and rebuilding. The U.S. military has prematurely and inhumanely invaded Afghanistan. Rioting, confused, suffering, angry, and shocked New York citizens defiantly shout out their souls up and down the streets, refusing to be broken by what they've experienced.

Real documentary footage, impromptu acting, minimalistic, throbbing music, and the streets of New York come to life in a way that shows New York is New York, and nothing's going to change New York.

Look for a clip of Rev Al Sharpton giving a speech about Patriotism.

Lastly: Will, keep your hair long!",1128729600,3,956,5.025316455696203
