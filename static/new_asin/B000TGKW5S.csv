8209284,5,B000TGKW5S,Love this movie! It has all the elements of a surrealist South American fairy tale. Gorgeous.,1454889600,,93,4.875
8209285,1,B000TGKW5S,This just wasn't for me or for my Spanish 1 class.  It's old and even though it's on a DVD you can tell it's old.  It's also weird with strange jumps into a fantasy world with no explanation.  It might do well in a film class or in an upper level Spanish class where they can discuss themes but for a lower level class of Freshman and Sophomores this was a bust.,1388793600,,362,4.0

8209287,5,B000TGKW5S,"Some of the most powerful sounding drumming of Afro beats in the Americas come from Uruguay. So far much of it does not make its way out of South America to Northern America. This entire video of movie and special features sets out to school our ignorance. The special features are as entertaining and important as the feature film. It may make the movie more entertaining if the mini documentary feature on drumming and comparsa is viewed before. The actual movie itself is the world of Spanish murgas and Afro comparsas, and how it would be in a perfect world. The movie never leaves its own innocence behind and never fully becomes an adult even though the crises facing the central child figure are those of an adult. The movie is very educational especially for young boys moving into tweener age. The focus is the importance of education and imagination. Children want perfect worlds and getting to adulthood many times means abandoning such idealistic dreams. A Dios Momo says childhood is forever.",1246233600,2,1005,4.848837209302325
