2023652,3,B0001Q23SK,"I bought this DVD (""The Barber of Siberia"") because I am a huge fan of the director, Nikita Mikhalkov. While I love his other movies (Burnt by the Sun, Oblomov, Dark Eyes, Close to Eden, 12), I wish I had skipped ""The Barber of Siberia.""

Overall, ""The Barber of Siberia"" is very disappointing. While the cinematography in this big-budget (45 million dollar) film is absolutely stunning, the performances by the actors are among the worst I have ever seen. The performances are unnatural, exaggerated, forced, slapstick, and cartoonish. Over the three hours course of the movie, the director does not seem to know if he wants a comedy, a romance, a drama, an exploration of the ""heart of Russia."" The one good performance in this film was delivered by Aleksei Petrenko (who plays General Radlov). This is the same actor who played General Ivolgin so brilliantly in the ""Idiot"" mini-series from 2003.

Some 70 percent of this film is in English. Where subtitles are needed, the English subtitles are excellent.

A bit of historical nitpicking (just one of many anachronisms): In one of the scenes from the year 1905, an American flag with 50 stars is shown. The American flag did not have 50 stars until 1960: in 1905, I believe the American flag had only 45 stars.",1276905600,,1264,4.7889908256880735
2023653,4,B0001Q23SK,"This is a long, unevenly directed story which really wants to be an epic romance and almost, but not quite succeeds.  It is undoubtedly beautiful.  The scenery both in Moscow and also in the scenes in Siberia is a suitably breathtaking stage for a tragic story of romance set against turn of the Century Russia.  Julia Ormond is also ravishing here, and her performance underpins the success of the movie.  Her Russian counterpart, the young Russian cadet Tolstoy (no relation to the author, as he frequently has to explain) with whom she falls in love when he stumbles into her train compartment, played by Oleg Menshikov, is less successful.  His performance lurches somewhat heavy handedly from slapstick clown to would be troubled young man with deep feelings.

Richard Harris is wasted and gives an altogether over the top performance as the inventor of the titular machine - a steam driven contraption for chopping down the trees of Siberia, which he nicknames the barber of Siberia.  The would be clever part is that Tolstoy plays the barber of Seville in the officers school performance.  Robert Hrdy even crops up unexpectedly in one scene as an English language instructor.

The direction goes to lengths in certain scenes to come across as epic and is often beautifully photographed and set up - to the point where it can feel TOO staged - as in the scene on the platform where the cadets looking for their colleague search for him in such a way as their search becomes a dance for the camera.  However the overall effect is pleasing enough as long as you can swallow the stageiness, mixed as it is with some truly un-stage-like milieus of Moscow and Siberia.

The dual language here works well.  This does not feel like some euro film with too many cooks spoiling the broth - it is clearly a filmmakers vision (Nikita Mikhalkov), where English speaking actors speak English speaking roles and Russian actors the Russian roles, successfully giving the movie crossover appeal from the normal arthouse crowd.  In particular, it is a pleasure to see a movie showing this part of history showing the Russians of the time who supported the Tsar as patriots, and the officer cadre as being a chivalrous life.

In summary I would have to say this IS a beautiful movie, worth watching - Julia Ormond is terrific, the music score is suitably melancholic, the scenery fantastic, and the story interesting - if a tad futile come the end.  Worth the journey, if not the destination!",1170547200,3,2481,4.804705882352941
2023654,5,B0001Q23SK,"It seems that Russian novels and (sometimes) Russian films
make some of the best epics in history. This movie recreates the grand sweep of Romanov Russia in a story of love, honor, duty, and deception.  The plot surrounds a young cavalry officer's infatuation for the daughter of an American inventor; but the father has has other plans for her.  Oleg Menshikov - the young officer - is a dream; he is one of the most handsome heroes in cinema. (He also appears in the film East West) Yes, the film is long but with the gorgeous cinematography, you won't notice it.  A very unusual treat.",1139184000,11,588,4.580952380952381
2023655,4,B0001Q23SK,"My wife and I saw Barber of Siberia in Paris in a theater along the Champs Elysees. I thought the romantic surroundings had tainted my view of the film (I enjoyed it immensely) so I purchased it a few weeks ago and watched again. No dissapointments here --the film remains a favorite of mine.

Rather than a synopsis, let me describe the strengths of the film. First Oleg Menshikov. He is perhaps the best feature of the film, despite an excellent performance by Julia Ormond. Menshikov is charming and expressive in a way I wouldn't expect from a Russian. His charm compares to Roberto Bernini in Life Is Beautiful.

True to its Russian character, the story is as dramatic as a psych patient off their meds. Lost love, comedy, feuding friends, swordplay, passion, and imprisonment are just some of the elements in the film. It is this dramatic range that makes the film so worthwhile. Unlike western films that seem to be either a romance, or a comedy, the Barber of Siberia will entertain everyone.

Russia itself is also a supporting actor in this movie. The beautiful cinematography makes me want to plan a trip to Moscow or even Siberia. The Fair scene alone is a set piece worth the price of admission.

Does the film have its weaknesses? Certainly. It would seem their budget didn't include an editor as the length at times diminishes from the film. But among recent films (the last 10 years) this is one of the best. Also the narrative doesn't allow the major themes of the film to progress from covert to overt.

Taken as a whole, this is an excellent film. Sad that it never made it to the big screen in the U.S. Guys, watch this with your wife and get credit for a romantic film that will entertain you as well.",1105488000,5,1722,4.541935483870968
2023656,5,B0001Q23SK,"Definitely a great epic movie, the Barber of Siberia, brings to the screen the story of Jane, a beautiful cosmopolitan courtesan and Andrey, a young Cadet in the Imperial Army, during the years of Tsar Alexander III in Holy Russia.

The film combines drama, action, and adventure, making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in historical films after a long dormant period.

Needless to say, Oleg Menshikov, Julia Ormond, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

The setting, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!

History, Love, Passion, and Honor, are all about.

Nikita Mihalkov has scored his biggest hit yet with the Barber of Siberia!

You can feel that the movie was filmed especially to win the prize, not to touch the souls, and that's a pity.

I must say that of the Russian classics I've seen over the years (e.g., DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, WAR AND PEACE, etc), this one ranks at the top (I would include the film ADMIRAL in my list of top picks). Although long, it never loses interest. While the story line may seem at first view a bit fantastic, it all seems to just fit and make sense.  I was impressed with Mikhalkov's BURNT BY THE SUN, and this release confirms my view that he is Russia's greatest living director. Let me add, that the RUSCICO release is the one to acquire; it does have English subtitles, although the film (especially with Julia Ormond and Richard Harris) is about 2/3 in English to begin with.

2023712,5,B0001Q23SK,"This movie was recommended by my wife, who is Russian, and watched this when she still lived in Russia. It was so well made by a famous Russian director (Nikita Mikhalkov), who actually appears in the Movie as the Czar, that it is virtually hard to distinguish it from an American film. He also produced and wrote this film.

The scene is set in pre-Russian Revolution period at the turn of the last century. The story is of a beautiful American woman(Julia Ormond),who plays a courtesan, that was hired by an eccentric Entrepreneur (Richard Harris), to come to Russia to seduce a Russian officer into allowing him to use his invention to cut down trees in Siberia, hence the name (The Barber of Siberia). Instead, she meets and falls in love with a cadet officer(Oleg Menshikov), on a train during her travels into Russia, then the story goes on from there.

The story plays out in such a way that it is so entertaining in how it shows and compares Russian culture and tradition in almost all aspect of their comedy, to their most intimate feelings, and how the love affair that blossomed was taken very seriously for the man, but was not as much for the woman at first. It is hysterically funny most of the time, and then very sad at some points. Such a roller coaster ride of a love story!

I don't want to be a spoiler, so I will just tell you that you will NOT be disappointed. It is so colorful, beautiful locations in Russia, beautiful scenes and lighting, and the story is outstanding! The movie is about 3 hours long too, but it doesn't seem that, because you are so drawn into the story and everything in it! Brilliantly made film in all aspects!

2023715,5,B0001Q23SK,"Wonderful scenery.  An unusual plot full of strange events yet still a love story.  Odd perhaps but fun and full of unexpected events that are happy, tragic, silly, profound, musical, stupid, in other words rather human.  Rarely did I predict the plot.

A bit slapstick once in a while, quite serious as well, sad to watch a woman cause misery in people until she knows love.  Like so many women today perhaps.

Pagentry appears here and there, doing no harm, well, unless taken to excess, again a modern problem.  Even a Tsar's little daughter can show love for father by doing as he does as all kids will do.  Even a Tsar can behave like a father despite all the pompous parading.

Even a monk can be late, an actor off cue, a stern and stately General make himself a terrible fool scorned by his own sled driver.  The clever can be so stupid.  People are not perfect thankfully.

Perfect people in a perfect world may resent the characters and the plot.  I have read the reports of critics elsewhere who throw this movie into the rubbish with clever wordsmithing.  One is from a Place called New York.  His review seems to me, in my opinion, a portrait of himself as a perfect all knowing expert.  Nagging faultfinding  reviews of that type make their authors seem a very boring type who find in a movie only what they want to find.

A movie can make fun in many ways even of itself.  The greatest human behavior has the ability to be subtle while making a fool of oneself which isn't a popular common skill these days.  Being perfect is the popular effort nowadays, in my opinion, resulting in unbearable boredom.  As some English person said long ago somewhere, Yanks lack a sense of irony, perhaps that's so.

Both Russian and English are spoken.  English subtitles are there for the spoken Russian. The dvd menu seems to be in Russian only but I figured it out.  By guessing.",1325289600,,1882,4.516320474777448
8016053,5,B0001Q23SK,"The Barber of Siberia, by Nikita Mikhalkov, is not like other Russian made movies.  This movie has been criticized for being too Hollywood in its comedy/drama way.  The movie opens in Massachusetts in 1905, Jane (Julia Ormond) is writing a letter to her son, Andrew, explaining his lineage and who his real father is.  Flashback to 1885 Moscow where we meet several Russian officers, one in particular being Andrey Tolstoy (Oleg Menshikov).

The movie opens to Villa Amelia, Springfield, Massachusetts, on July 3rd, 1905.  Jane is writing a letter to her son Andrew who is away for the US military.  She says she is going to tell the story of her past with Andrews father.  We flash to a military base where cadets are getting haircuts.  The General Jane and Andrey meet on a train in first class, where Jane is riding.  Andrey mentions he played Figaro in The Marriage of Figaro and Jane took an interest.  She offered him some alcohol and kept filling his glass, inevitably leading to Tolstoy becoming drunk.  During his drunken stupor, Tolstoy shows a photograph of his mother to Jane and explains that he joined the army to make her proud.  The General finds Tolstoy in Janes compartment and hurriedly escorts the cadet out.  Jane realizes that Tolstoy left his mothers photograph behind but by the time she realizes this it is too late to return it to him.

The acting in this film differ from some other Russian films in the fact that there are frequent English scenes and a lot more humor.  When Jane is first introduced in the middle of several Russian cadets, she screams and then starts singing as the majority of the officers flee her cabin in fear of being caught in first class.  This movie has been criticized as being too Hollywood for a Russian film but I feel this would open more doors for the movie because of this fact.

The directing of this film was phenomenal.  The interchanging between the Russian and the English scenes added some extra humor during potentially more serious scenes make this an easier film to watch even though the film is quite considerable in length.  There was a scene where Jane first meets General Radlov and he asks her if she speaks Russian, German, and French before she tells him that she speaks English exclusively.  He is a little flustered at first and asks for a Russian to English dictionary so that he is able to speak to her, as she is speaking to his he is frantically trying to find the translations to reply to her. This provided some comedic relief during a serious scene.

Being that I am newer to Russian films (I am taking a Russian culture class in college) I found this movie to be the better of the films we watch this semester.  I enjoyed the plot, the acting, the mix of languages, the love twists, and the action.  This film is now one of my favorites because its not like the films I am used to in America.  There were aspects still very Russian in their portrayals while possibly having more of a Hollywood feel to them, either way, it definitely broadens this films horizons for audience capture.",1489017600,,3071,4.613259668508287

Movie Review

The film I chose to do a movie review on is The Barber of Siberia. The film is a romantic-comedy made in 1998 set in Russia. It stars Oleg Menshikov as cadet Andrei Tolstoi, Julia Ormond as Jane Callahan, and Aleksei Petrenko as general Radlov.
 The film follows cadet Tolstoi, a Russian soldier who meets a vexing young woman by the name of Jane Callahan on a train. Cadet Tolstoi is infatuated with Jane almost immediately after meeting her. Shortly after Tolstoi finds himself in competition with his fellow cadets for Janes affection. After prevailing against his fellow cadets, Tolstoi still finds himself competing for Janes affection, with his commanding officer, General Radlov. Due to his feelings for Jane, cadet Tolstoi attacks General Radlov with a violin bow while participating in a play.
 The role of cadet Tolstoi was played very well and accurately portrayed the ideology of a Russian soldier. Tolstoi was very disciplined and very respectful throughout the movie. He also had an almost blind love for the czar which is to be expected of a Russian soldier.
 Another aspect that helped authenticate the film was the wardrobe. The movie is set in the late 1800s and the characters outfits matched as such. The wardrobe ranged from Russian soldier uniforms to traditional royal clothing.
 Overall I enjoyed the movie. It had a lot of funny antics throughout the movie such as pranks and romantic rivalry. The movie also captured important aspects of Russian culture and traditions throughout the film. The movie also shows the lighter side of Russian cinema despite its ending.",1489017600,,1621,5.029850746268656
8016055,5,B0001Q23SK,"Nikita Mikhalkovs The Barber of Siberia (1998), is a drama staring Oleg Menshikov as Andrei Tolstoy, Julia Ormond as Jane Callahan, Richard Harris as Douglas McCracken, and Aleksey Petrenko as General Radlov. The film takes place at a Russian military academy. Throughout the movie, the audience observes Jane and Tolstoy meet and watches their relationship develop.
 The film starts with showing the current time  Jane Callahan as a mother. She is writing to her son to tell him all about his father. The movie flashes back many years and shows what happened during her younger years. It all starts on a train. A group of rowdy cadets are running through a train and they stumble upon Jane Callahan. The other cadets leave the room in the train, but Tolstoy stays behind and has a couple of drinks with Jane. It is not long before he is drunk and the two of them are laughing and telling one another about their lives. It is clear at this moment that Tolstoy is falling in love with Jane Callahan. The two part  Tolstoy returning to the academy and Jane going to meet with her father. We find out later in the movie that she works with her father and her job is to seek sponsorship from the Grand Duke for her fathers invention, which supposedly would make harvesting quicker, cheaper, and more efficient. Back at the academy, Tolstoy is depicted as a disruptive boy in love. The two go to a dance of some sort, but do not get to dance with one another. Though dancing with another woman, Tolstoy can not seem to keep his eyes off of Jane. General Radlov and Jane attend the Shrovetide Festival. Jane is there for business but it seems as though General Radlov believes she is there for the company. At the festival, Jane gets Radlov to drink an astonishing amount of vodka. It is amazing that he was still breathing after all that alcohol. Being drunk, he causes a scene and destroys parts of the festival. He wakes up not knowing where he is, though just a few feet away from the festival, and soon after realizes his love for Jane. Jane goes to Andreys house and the two share an intimate night. Soon after, Jane tells him about her life. She tells him her deepest, darkest secrets and she soon realizes she is falling in love with Andrey. The ending must remain a secret. Watch the movie yourself to see if this love thrives or fails.
 This movie had strong lead characters. The actors and actresses that played in this movie fit the roles perfectly and were clearly very skilled. Oleg Menshikov clearly fit the role of Tolstoy  a man in love. It was clear from the beginning that the producers casted the perfect fit for this role. The train scene clearly depicted a slightly awkward man who did not know how to perfectly act around a woman he thought was beautiful. As for Julia Ormond, she also fit perfectly into the movie. She played the role of a strong working woman who knew how to manipulate men to get the things she wanted. For example, at the festival scene, she knew just what to say and do in order to make the General do as she wished.
 The costumes in this film were also very impressive. They depicted the cast perfectly. Jane in particular had beautiful costumes. She had on old dresses and big hair. It fit perfectly into this movie. Andrey Tolstoy was also properly dressed. His uniforms were well fitting and it made him look stunning. Beautiful costumes for a beautiful couple!
 Overall, I enjoyed this film. Though very long, it was not hard to stay entertained. The dancing is breathtaking, the sets are perfect, and the story line was nothing short of flawless. I have watched a couple of other Russian films and this one is very different from the rest. As an American, I like constant entertainment throughout the movie, but that is not what is seen in many Russian films. They can often be much slower and involve more thinking. Perhaps this is why critics did not love the movie. I highly recommend taking the time to watch this movie!",1489017600,,3969,4.566011235955056
8016056,5,B0001Q23SK,"The film The Barber of Siberia, directed by Nikita Mikhalkov, was released in 1998. The film stars many prominent Russian and American actors, included the likes of Julia Ormond, Oleg Meshikov, Aleksey Petrenko, and Richard Harris. This drama is set in Russia and follows the lives of Ms. Jane Callahan and a young cadet, Andrey Tolstoy through the winter of 1885.
The film opens with an American woman, Jane Callahan, writing to her son, an American cadet, about her travels to Moscow and the truth about who his father is. We then flashback 20 years and Jane is traveling to Moscow by train to meet with her father, Mr. McCracken. Her mission is to gain the sponsorship of the Grand Duke for her fathers immaculate invention: an enormous machine that would make harvesting trees much more efficient. Paying homage to the films title, this very machine is given the name The Barber of Siberia. While on her travels, Ms. Callahan encounters a young cadet, Andrey Tolstoy, and while sharing a bottle of champagne, Andrey falls in love. Upon arrival to Moscow, Jane meets with her father and Andrey returns to military academy. As the movie progresses, we witness Andreys young-hearted, charismatic pranks at school and his pining for Janes love. We can also see Janes charm and sophistication as she struggles to distinguish her true feelings from false emotions and motives. Jane becomes close to Tolstoys superior, General Radlov, in an attempt to gain the Grand Dukes sponsorship for her father. The pair attends the Shrovetide Festival and Jane urges the General to drink copious amounts of vodka, causing a large scene and eventual destruction of the festival. From this point forward, the general is determined to marry Jane. He uses Andrey as a tool in his engagement attempt, yet is unsuccessful. During an intimate night, Jane divulges deep secrets to Andrey about her past and she begins to realize she loves him as well. When Andrey begins to feel threatened by the general he attacks and is sent off to prison in Siberia, never to be seen by Jane again.
The scenery of this film is impeccable. The grandeur is remarkable and the colors of the film bring this film to life. Nothing was spared in scenery as the director and producers sought to convey a beautiful backdrop for a truly moving and captivating movie. During the Shrovetide Festival, the audience is visually delighted with realistic structures and celebratory activities and at the cadets graduation, the scene is perfectly set at the Kremlin with intricate buildings and sprawling courtyards.i
In regard to costume design, it is evident that every detail was precisely chosen. Grand costumes were chosen for the tsar and were accurate for the period in which this film was set. Jane is a perfect example of the costume designers precise attention to detail all the way down to her veils and earrings. She was never without a corset or wig and her beauty and dress was captivating.
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Despite harsh reviews from many critics, I feel as though this film did a marvelous job of balancing slapstick comedy with a heavy and dramatic plot. Although Jane tries to convey at the beginning that she is revealing a secret to the audience, we know that the secret is that Andrey is her sons father. Still with this knowledge, I was left wondering where this story may lead. The film continued to dig deeper into Janes character and her relationship with Andrey and the general. It also depicted many beautiful scenes and traditions of Russia, something many of us are not familiar with. I would recommend this film to anyone who has a taste for historical pieces and doesnt mind a little nonsensical humor.",1488931200,,3707,4.885714285714286
8016057,5,B0001Q23SK,"The Barber of Siberia is a drama and comedy. The film takes place in the late 1800s and very early 1900s. For a majority of the movie the setting is in Moscow, and it is a flashback. The mom (Jane Callahan) is writing to her son in a military training camp in the 1900s and is telling him the story of her and his father (Andrey Tolstoy). The main stars of the film are Julia Ormond as Jane Callahan, Richard Harris as Douglas McCracken, Oleg Menshikov as Andrey Tolstoy and Aleksei Petrenko as General Radlov.

The plot of the film is very easy to follow. First, we meet Jane on a train to Moscow. This is where she meets Andrey. A military man who his in her cabin to escape his general. They form a connection over Mozart and other classical music. Andrey shows Jane a picture of his mom and then the general comes in and drags him away. Second, we see Jane going to the military academy to return the photo of Andreys mom to him. This is where Jane is formally introduced to Andreys general: General Radlov. Thirdly, we see Jane when she attended Andreys graduation from Military Academy. Fourth, Andrey is recruited to help Radlov propose to Jane, even though they barely knew each other. Andrey could not do it and left after declaring his love for Jane. Lastly, we see Jane sitting waiting for Andrey in his house for him to return from leave and she confronts him about his decree of love. Much more happens but I do not want to give too much away.

The film was filmed very well. Most critics said this is more Hollywood but I think that is what makes it a good movie. One example of this is the camera angles. There were plenty of shots that carried a lot of meaning. There were close-ups during serious scenes like many of the scenes involving Jane and Andrey. One scene in particular that stands out to me is when Jane went to confront Andrey at his house. They were sitting opposite each other at a table and when each one was talking it would go to a close up of their face to demonstrate the seriousness of the matter they were discussing.

Another example of this would be the lighting. Back to the confrontation between Jane and Andrey, the entire scene was filmed in low light. In the train where Jane first met Andrey it was bright lighting. This is demonstrating that this was a very light hearted scene where they were comfortable with each other.

I thought this film was very funny. Around 80% of it was in English, but there are subtitles if needed. I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a funny yet dramatic film with a little bit of romance. The quality of the film I also thought was very good for the late 90s and I even forgot I was watching a foreign film.",1488931200,,2699,4.370517928286852

The stars of the film include Jane Callahan, played by Julia Ormond; Andrey Tolstoy, played by Oleg Menshikov; General Radlov, played by Aleksei Petrenko and Douglas McCracken, played by Richard Harris. The story takes place in a variety of settings. It starts with Jane, who is in Massachusetts, is writing to her son who is in a military academy. The story then jumps 20 years into the past to when Jane travels to Russia in 1885. The setting jumps back and forth between Jane writing the letter, Jane in Russia and her son in the U.S. military academy.
As I stated above, Jane Callahan is a beautiful American who is writing to her son to tell him a story she has kept from him for so long. Jane flashes back to 1885 when she goes to assist engineer Douglas McCracken. McCracken is invested in getting the Grand Duke of Russias sponsorship to build a machine that will cut trees in Siberia. While she is aboard a train to reach McCracken, she meets a Russian cadet named Andrey Tolstoy. On the train, they share the same interest for champagne, food and music. When Jane arrives, she meets the powerful General Radlov. General Radlov is struck by her beauty and grace. He asks Tolstoy for his help in asking for her hand in marriage. Here, Tolstoy and Radlov learn that they are rivals for Janes love. But, she spends passionate times with Tolstoy and promises to marry him. But, in order to get the Grand Dukes audience, she lies to the General about her love for Tolstoy. Tolstoy overhears and is heartbroken. The actions that follow set the twos lives on very different paths.
An aspect of filmmaking that stuck out in this film is the scenery. I feel they did an excellent job in recreating life in 19th century Russia. The costumes were exquisite, the setting was beautiful, especially when they captured the scenery of Siberia. The scene in the ballroom was filled with color and beauty. The scene that captured the cadets graduation, was set in the square of the city. The buildings were very 19th century like. The movie revealed the true beauty of the Russian culture and landscape.
The acting was very good in the film. Im sure it was a challenge to recreate people from that time era. The actors did wonderfully in speaking both languages and revealed that language barriers were quite common. The native Russian actors did a great job when they spoke English, showing it was no easy task.
I really enjoyed the film. It was like no movie I have seen before. I highly recommend this film to anyone that has been wanting to see it. It is quite long, but you will be entertained throughout.",1488931200,,2715,4.6115702479338845
8016059,5,B0001Q23SK,"This Russian film, directed by Nikita Mikhalkov, was very well structured. It is a lovable, comedic drama and will always have an appreciative audience no matter how far into the future because it is timeless. Timeless, in the sense that people of all generations would be eventually able to enjoy it. A beautiful story with its foundations on hopeless romance in addition to unrequited love is not a clich in this movie, but more of an old, classic style with Shakespearian undertones. The main actors and actresses, Julia Ormond, Richard Harris, Oleg Menshikov, and Aleksei Petrenko do extremely well to portray an exaggeration of the people of late 1800s, early 1900s in Moscow and America.  The plot has many scenes that will fill you with all different kinds of emotions, meant in the best way possible.
 The story begins with a playful, young, American woman named Jane Callahan, played by Julia Ormond, who is on her way to Russia to help Douglas McCracken with marketing his new tree chopping machine. On the train ride to her destination, she meets a cadet named Andrei Tolstoi, played by Oleg Menshikov, who is also playful and young. Their relationship ends up creating game of flirtatious push and pull throughout the whole film. Jane continuously searches and asks about Tolstoi after she meets him. She eventually meets up with General Radlov, played by Aleksei Petrenko, and eventually tries wooing him to persuade the general in order to get to the Grand Duke for endorsement of the tree chopping machine. Tolstoi and Jane fall in love, but unfortunately so does Radlov. Tolstoi and Jane both have  other admirers, except Tolstoi is too oblivious to realize this. Jane eventually feels comfortable enough to confide in Tolstoi, but does she tell him everything? Will the rivalry between Tolstoi and Radlov along with Janes original purpose for traveling to Russia be too much pressure on these relationships? Many hilarious events will occur throughout the portrayal of these relationships such as, festivals, balls, drunks, and maybe some things that will give you cringing second-hand embarrassment. The whole story is told in the past tense as Jane writes to her son in the American army.
 One aspect that I thought was done perfectly was how the costumes were used. Janes characters costumes especially did well in portraying her character. Throughout the whole movie she is dressed extravagantly with wigs, dresses, hats, etc. In the scene where Jane and the general go to the festival together she is wearing a black hat with a black veil covering her face. This could have been done to portray in clothing that Jane is hiding her real purpose from the general. Hiding that the only reason she is spending time with him is to use him, and that he is mostly an obstacle to get to the Grand Duke. Just how much of herself is she hiding from everyone? There are other scenes where she is wearing a veil as well, covering her face. In the scene were Jane arrives at Tolstois house to get closer with him, she is very dressed down. No wig, makeup, or elaborate clothing. Nothing to hide herself. She looks more vulnerable in this scene because this is where she unveils most of herself to Tolstoi, allowing him to see past her faade. The director possibly uses the costumes for Jane as a symbol of her lifeways, personality, and struggles.
 I also thought that the direction was done very specifically. In the scene with the ball, where the cadets were dancing with the women, Tolstoi dances with an unknown hideous woman, while Jane dances with another cadet. While they are dancing they are looking and focusing on each other, even though dancing with different people. Could this be portraying the difficulties and barriers that exist between their budding relationship, something that may or may not be out of reach? Another aspect of Mikhalkovs direction that I liked was the scene where Tolstoi comes into contact with the rebel that made an attack in the beginning of the film. Tolstoi comes face to face with the rebel as he climbs down the ladder. The ladder separates them and the rebel begs Tolstoi to spare his life. Even though he is a cadet and already has his gun pointed at him, he lets the rebel escape. I feel like the ladder separating them showed the oppositions in Russia at the time. The ones who followed the rules unconditionally and those who wanted to see change in the government.  This scene opens up a lot about Tolstois character, showing his kindness and arguably, his weakness.
 Compared to other Russian films I have seen, this one is quite exaggerated, so I was very surprised. In particular it exaggerates the romantic scenes and the jokes. Some scenes show many things that you would not see happening by chance in real life. Im not sure if this is typical for Russian movies or not, but I don't think Russian films use the humor that we would find in this movie. A lot of the humor in it is about making people look very foolish and playing practical jokes on each other. Perfect for the American audience I would say, but people anywhere could enjoy this film. I thought the best actor in the film was Oleg Menshikov, since he was a very convincing drunk, young cadet, and young lover. Most of the movie is filled with light, fluffy scenes that will make the viewer smile, although it does become harsh at some points in the film. Overall I would say that this was a very enjoyable film, even though some people would say it is cheesy, but cheesy is a nice change once and a while. Id recommend that this would be a good movie to watch with friends to switch up your movie-watching routines, and a good way for many people to ease into watching foreign films. Nothing in the film is difficult to understand with everything very straight - forward, and all of your questions will be answered by the end of the film.",1488931200,,5869,4.742409402546523

The film is The Barber of Siberia, directed and written by Nikita Mikhalkov who was also a part of the cast. Also, Oleg Menshikov, Julia Ormond and many more. Music was by Eduard Artemyev and Anatoly Dokumentov. The film was 180 minutes and filmed in Russia with Russian and English communication. It was released on October 30, 1998 in Russia.

This beautiful American woman name Jane was writing to her son who was a cadet at a well renowned military academy. She wanted to tell him a long kept secret that he never knew about. She came to Russia twenty years ago to help out Douglas McCracken an engineer. The two men she met that suddenly changed her life was Cadet Andre and General Radlov and both became opponents because they both were in love with Jane. The general and the cadet wanted to marry her! She still had the big secret she wanted to tell Andre. She promises to marry him and they even made love one night after an emotional dispute, but Andre one night overhears Jane telling the general she really wasn't into Andre to win the general over. Andre during his stage performance after being emotionally hurt by overhearing what Jane said, he jumped off stage and attacked the general.

With the filmmaking, I was say it was well done, but it didn't seem like your typical Russian film. It really looked American made, even with the actors/actress, the settings and the communication. Probably because there was a lot of the English language used and not that much Russian. The most Russian in the film was the military and Russian names. There were so many laughs and love! The average American films are love, comedy which is romantic comedy, if it isn't an action film. Such as, the scene where Andre and Jane made love after having a small dispute and Andre in the beginning trying to impress her by getting drunk to win her over. The editing was normal, there wasn't anything strange or out of the ordinary. There were many moving camera shots other than cuts and transitions like all movies. Youd usually find a lot of moving camera shots in action films.

I thought the movie overall was great just because I am a big fan of romantic comedy. I would say I was expecting a big more Russian language just for my benefit. It didn't really tell me anything about the culture or give me the chance to hear a lot of the Russian language since it was a Russian film. The storyline was great and the actors did a fantastic job.",1488931200,,2456,4.549773755656108
8016061,4,B0001Q23SK,"I first watched Barber of Siberia in one of my college classes. The setting of this movie is both shown in Russia and the United States. The movie opens up in the year 1905, however it also takes place in the year 1885. The type of film this is a little of comedy, romance, drama and adventure. Some important characters in this movie are Julia Ormond who played Jane Callahan, Richard Harris who plays Douglas McCraken, Oleg Menshikov who plays Andrei Tolstoi, Aleksei Petrenko who plays General Radlov and of course the director of the movie, Nikita Michalkov.

The movie opens up showing a woman writing a letter to someone, her face is never seen and all you hear is her voice. Scenes change and were taken to a training camp with candidates fighting with there sergeant over Mozart. The candidate refuses to say he doesn't like Mozart so he is punished for it. I don't want to give away to much of the movie but some other important scenes in the movie are when Jane and Andrei first meet on the train and that is when Andrei fell in love with Jane. The scene with the Army ball and the candidates play a prank. They decided to make the floor slippery so that it was impossible for anyone to walk on. This scene also shows us that General Radlov falls for Jane. Another important scene is where both Andrei and his fellow candidate are in love with Jane, however the only way they know how to settle it is by fencing. Andrei ends up getting hurt and his friend fells horrible about it and it leads Andrei to change his mind about school. The last scene I believe is important is at the show that the candidates put on for everyone including the Zar. Andrei became jealous when he saw Jane and General Radlov together, so he jumped off stage and grabbed a violin bow and went after the General. This scene is a major part of the movie but I don't want to give away what happened next, you will just have to watch it to find out.

When watching any movie I have always been drawn to the costumes. This movie especially I like how they portrayed the Russian culture through the costumes. Whether it came to the soldiers uniforms, the women's dresses, and the Russian people through out the scenes. They captured the true assents of Russia. Even getting the minor details of each costume I really liked. Every detail matters when making a movie and I believe they did a good job at capturing Russia.

Another part of movies I enjoy is the music. This movie didn't have a lot of music but it also played a big part in the movie. They had of course the scene with the performance that the candidates put on. It was a musical but also had some comedy to it. The major part of the movie I'm referring to that has to do with music is Mozart. Mozart was such a big thing in this movie. The American candidate refused to say he did not like Mozart because he believed in he's music so much and knew how great of a composer he was. He never backed down and was punished for it but that never seemed to bother him. He stood up for something he believed in even if it's music. Music plays a big role in everyone's lives and this one candidate showed just that and even made his Sergeant change his mind on Mozart.

Overall I enjoyed this movie and I would recommend this movie to others. I have never been the one to watch foreign films but I think the reason why I liked it so much was that it was following an American woman so the film was not all in Russian. I appreciated all the Russian culture and how it portrayed the Russian community and military. Some of acting was a little off for me and was hard to follow but like I said overall I enjoyed the movie and I would watch it again.",1488931200,,3682,4.308802308802309
8016062,3,B0001Q23SK,"Written and produced by Nikita Mikhalkov, Barber of Siberia is a movie briefly based on historic events that is portrayed as a comedic drama.  The main characters of the movie are Jane Callahan (played by Julia Ormand), Douglas McCracken (played by Richard Harris), Andrey Tolstoy (played by Oleg Menshikov), and General Radlov (played by Aleksei Petrenko).  The setting of the movie takes place in Moscow in 1885 under the tsarist rule of Alexander III, when an American woman Jane Callahan travels from Massachusetts.
 Douglas McCracken is an inventor who created a large steam-engine machine that would be used for cutting down trees.  In 1885, he hires Jane Callahan to pose as his daughter in hopes that he can use her looks and charm to win over a Russian of importance so that he may sell and use his invention to cut down trees, and in turn make a large sum of money.  Keep in mind this is tsarist Russia in 1885, which was considered a very authoritative state where it could be corrupt in ways.  Because of this, McCracken knew it would be hard to sell his machine, which is why he hired Jane (pretending to be his daughter) to be a seductress to help him get a better chance at selling his product.  On Janes way to Moscow, she meets a group of cadets on a train.  One cadet that she seems very interested in is Andrey Tolstoy.  The two (Jane and Tolstoy) seem to have an instant connection with one another, and it appears Tolstoy falls in love with Jane over a bottle of champagne.  Once Jane arrives in Moscow, one of her targets, General Radlov, falls prisoner to her charm and falls in love at a Russian festival.  When Radlov feels he has gained Janes love, he plans on asking her to marry (following right along with McCrackens plan).  Radlov speaks poor English, so when asking Jane to marry, he chooses a cadet to translate his Russian proposal to ask Janes hand in marriage.  Unfortunately for Radlov, the cadet he chooses to read his proposal is Andrey Tolstoy, who we know to be in love with Jane.  When reading aloud the proposal from Radlov to Jane, Tolstoy cannot help but profess his love for Jane.  Radlov becomes enraged with fury and is very angry with Tolstoy.  Unbeknownst to the general, Jane returns Andreys love and goes to his house one day where they make love.  But, Jane has to keep her act going with General Radlov (since she was hired by McCracken).  During a play where Tolstoy is the main actor, he becomes enraged with fury at General Radlov being with Jane, and attacks the general in the middle of the play
 The acting in the movie ranged (as all movies do, from actor to actor), but overall was mediocre.  Julia Ormond (Jane) did her job as a seductress, but was hard to get a read on.  Janes flirty charm is undeniable, but a part of her character seems lackluster and on the surface.  While it is revealed that Jane has secrets during her visit with Tolstoy, her obvious deceptiveness throughout the movie gives her character a feel that she is hard to like.  Richard Harris acted well, and did his due diligence as the inventor hopeful to use Jane to get in close with an person of importance in Russia to sell his machine.  On the other hand, Aleksei Petrenko (as General Radlov) is sub-par.  While he is the general, he comes off quite goofy (especially in the festival scene), and even during the serious inquiries, does not play a convincing role.  Lastly, the man who makes the film is Oleg Menshikov (Andrey Tolstoy).  He plays a wonderful role in all aspects.  He is funny when the scenes are meant to be funny, he is serious when called for, and overall is the most likable character who you seem to be routing for the entire movie.
 One more part of the film-making which is not so appealing to many viewers is the length of the movie.  Sure, as in many good movies, a plot takes time to develop.  But, there are definitely parts of Barber in Siberia that could be taken out so that it would not have a 180 minute (3 hour) running time.  For instance, the scene where the floor is waxed so well that is is obviously slippery.  The joke is realized right away, but the scene drags on for much longer than is needed.  In addition, the scene at the festival where the general obviously becomes too drunk also seems drawn out.  Again, the first half of the movie that seems to force the slapstick humor could also be taken out in my opinion, as it does not add to the plot but steers the viewer away.  Certain parts like this that could be chipped away piece by piece to maybe dumb the movie down to 2 hours and 30 minutes would make it more plausible.  Three hours is just too long to keep the attention of an average viewer.
 Overall, I did enjoy the film.  I was very shaky in the beginning, but as the film progressed and the plot seemed to thicken and the characters fell into their roles, it turned out to be very entertaining.  The beginning confused me a bit, as it was switching back and forth between the cadet with the mask (1905) and the cadets in Russia including Tolstoy (1885).  In addition, the slapstick humor and Hollywood-like aspects were a bother to me.  The first half of the movie was this way, but the second half was much better in my opinion.  It got away from the silliness (which I am sure Mikhalkov intended), but I was just not a fan.  As it got more serious, that started to catch my attention.  In Mikhalkovs defense, the majority of movies start off strong but often end weak.  Barber of Siberia, however, did quite the opposite.  It started off slow and somewhat weak, but ended strongly, which is a very good thing.  To potential viewers- if you are in for a long movie that takes awhile to set off, but has some standout actors, I would recommend watching the drama Barber of Siberia.",1488931200,,5776,4.482296650717704
