8443826,5,B001R4SM3U,"I recently attended a workshop with David so I guess I am somewhat biased. However, I don't think this changes much regarding this (and the previous) DVDs both of which are must haves for yoga teachers.
They both help tremendously in understanding anatomy terminology and application to the practice of Yoga (David is an Ashtanga teacher but the DVD's are not specific to Ashtanga). Davids clear explanations and props help clarify a subject matter which is complex and alien to many Yoga teachers and practitioners.",1243555200,2,516,5.08235294117647
