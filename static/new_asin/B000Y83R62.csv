8422570,5,B000Y83R62,"Caught 'Pom' at the cinema while accompanying a friend who is a French student. More than quietly surprised - I was gently amazed by this film.
Beautifully shot with very good acting (esp leading man who cares for the horses) and magnificent French Ardennes horses, this movie is definitely one for all the horse lovers out there. ""Pom, Le Poulain"" has a 'real' feel to it. There is no room for Disney-ish storylines about perfect, attractive families or charicatured abusive parents. One is teased along by the storyline, not bludgeoned over the head by they style of movie that has to point out the foals loss using sad music and repeated shots of a mare galloping through the forest alone(as an example).
When the team horses are dragged backwards down the forest hill by logs that are far too heavy, I heard every person in the audience gasp. Later, the sounds of tissues being searched for and noses blown (this was for the happy bit - it IS after all a family movie) reverberated throughout the cinema.
You cannot go wrong with Pom, Le Poulain.
Personally I could even happily watch it with no sound at all. It is a truly beautiful movie.",1205020800,,1144,4.640394088669951
