2103467,2,B0002M5TRU,"There are people out there who gave this movie 5 stars. 5! And they said this was scary. This is actually one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. It is filled with tons of sexual innuendo. Everything from pedophilia to lesbianism. If that what people find scary, then perhaps it is. The person who played LEMORA looks like some dude with a mild case of acromegaly. And not surprisingly, she has never been in another movie. The people who gave this movie 4 or 5 stars are either NOT horror movie fans, or are basing there reviews soley on nostalgia. Perhaps this movie was scary some 30 yrs. ago, but today it only comes off as weird. If you are really interested in horror movies, read my other reviews for good horror movies.",1123113600,14,732,4.42962962962963
2103468,3,B0002M5TRU,"Here's an odd story: Back when I was just a young tike in the 70s, I must have caught part of ""Lemora"" on network TV. I'd long since forgotten the name of this film, but I did recall a handful of scenes: Namely a young girl trapped inside a bus while a horde of ferel zombie/vampire/werewolves (WTF are those things?) try to smash their way in, and that same girl spying on a female vampire as she feeds on a young boy. These must have been pretty chilling images for young Monkey Deathcar, because years later I couldn't for the life of me remember the name of the film (I'd come to even suspect that it was a childhood nightmare ... ), but those few images still stuck in my mind.

Lucky for me, I spent one night perusing horror films on Amazon, following the ""customers who bought this item also purchased ..."" trail, until I came across ""Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural."" The reviews sounded awfully familiar - Could it be the same movie? Well, it was, and I've got to say I feel fortunate for having stumbled upon this odd like b- genre flick.

The basic plot goes something like this: A gangster in the south of the 1930s murders his cheating wife and her love in cold blood and hits the road. He's accosted by the seductive, mysterious Lemora (Lesley Gilb) and her hooded minions. Lemora learns from a newspaper clip that this gangster has a daughter, 13-year-old Lila Lee (Cheryl Smith) - the purehearted ""angel"" of her church's congregation. Lila soon receives a letter from Lemora, claiming that her father is on his death bed in a distant town of Asteroth. Lila is urged to come alone and come at once. Of course, this is all a ruse - Lemora's real goal is to corrupt the young girl's Christian spirit ...

The rest of the picture veers into seriously odd ""Alice in Wonderland"" terrain. We follow Lila Lee (dressed in pigtails and a pink Sunday dress, and looking quite a few years older than 13), as she journeys to Lemora's Southern Gothic manor in the woods of Asteroth. Lila encounters pasty vampire children, a gypsy witch, feral zombielike creatures and of course, the seductive Lemora. Strong sexual overtones, unintention camp and loads of atmosphere ensue.

I won't lie to you: ""Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural"" isn't really a ""good"" movie by any stretch. Some of the sets are poor. Any scene that takes place in a ""moving"" vehicle was obviously shot in a stationary bus/car. The dialogue is frequently laugh-out-loud terrible. The acting is wildly uneven, ranging from ""competent"" to some of the worst performances I've ever seen on film. The bus drive's overacting would make William Shattner blush.

But, ""Lemora"" succeeds as cheesy good fun for a few reasons, not the least of which is atmosphere. Nearly the entire movie is bathed in an eerie blueish night, which does wonders for the nighttime shots of the creepy manor and surrounding marshlands. The movie also uses sound very well. Any outdoor scene is accompanied by chirping crickets, exotic birdsongs and distant grunts and creepy feral noises. The soundtrack is also solid, ranging from bible hymns to swelling orchestral music. Not bad.

""Lemora"" is also a wildly original vision. Not only do we get a vampire seductress, but the surrounding woods are teeming with these rotting, feral beasts. Imagine week-old zombies that act like werewolves and making grunting, dogpack noises and you get the idea. From what I gathered, they're sort of like vampires with rabies. It's scarier and not nearly as silly as it sounds.

And finally, the sexual overtones in ""Lemora"" are pretty racy, particularly since Lila Lee is supposedly 13. Near every adult in the picture is lusting after young Lila, especially Lemora herself. The suggestion of lesbianism and pedophilia would push buttons today - I can only imagine how censors must have reacted back in 1973.

The performances by Gilb and Smith are competent, if unspectacular. Gilb is adequately seductive and moves/speaks with grace, especially when you consider she's forced to deliver lines like ""Come with me and live for all eternity!"" Sadly, her makeup job is pretty wretched - pale skin, purple lips, purple nails ... and bright red cheeks? Either this was deliberate, or Gilb had some form of skin disease, because it's pretty silly looking.

Smith is also decent. For most of the movie, she trots around in a pink dress or runs through the woods in her cotton nightgown, which isn't nearly as erotic as it sounds. Smith doesn't have too much to say, which might be a good thing - she's not a great actress, and this adds more to the dreamlike atmosphere anyhow.

Overall, if you can tolerate poor acting and a low budget, ""Lemora"" treats you to atmosphere and imagination... from a b-horror movie filmed on a shoestring budget, you can't ask for much more. It'd make a great double-feature with ""Phantasm,"" another cheapo (but IMO significantly better) 70s horror cheesefest. Enjoy!",1111968000,5,4940,4.801176470588235
2103469,1,B0002M5TRU,"I bought this DVD, because all these good review about it an all. When I receive the DVD and watch it. What the silly stupid peace of cheesy crap this movie is, not scary at all. Can't believe this crap came to DVD, very cheap and cheesy stage, and acting was the ""WORST OF ALL"".

2103470,5,B0002M5TRU,"I give this movie 5 stars.  I have seen many vampire movies and this is may be my favorite. It is a very unique movie.  I have never seen a vampire movie before like this and Cheryl Smith is absolutely stunning as the blond teenage heroine.  What an unusual plot we have here, to have a black haired female vampire intent on possessing the innocent blond teenage girl.  Lemora is a very strong vampire and she is relentless... Lemora simply will NOT let the lovely blond girl escape!",1101772800,4,483,4.454545454545454
2103471,4,B0002M5TRU,"""Lemora"" is a 1973 cult film that had its share of rabid fans but was practically impossible to find on VHS.  Thanks to Synapse films, we can now enjoy on DVD this lost film that at the time caused quite a stir, due to hints of pedophilia, lesbianism and witchcraft.

""Lemora"" takes place during the depression-era 1920's in the deep south.  Lila Lee, a 13 year old girl, is revered around town as a singing angel, an object of virginal purity who is an upstanding member of the church singing choir.  Her father, a ruthless gangster who abandoned Lila and suddenly disappears from town, sends Lila a letter informing her he has been seriously injured and needs her help.  Lila thus packs her bags and heads deep into the swamps and bayous in search for her dad and ends up at a witch's coven.  The coven is headed by ""Lemora"", a vampire priestess who has kidnapped several children and wishes to make little Lila a piece in her collection...

The storyline is nothing spectacular rather it's the atmosphere created by director Richard Blackburn that makes this film a winner.  The pitch-black sets and the several scenes of little girl lost Lila running and hiding in the woods surrounding the witch coven lend the film a very surreal feel.  Cheryl Smith is perfect in the role of Lila, with her innocent and nave face, blond curls and white dress.  Her performance reminded me of Jennifer Connelly's in Phenomena; she's not called to say much but that actually helps to lend the film its dream-like feel.

It's easy to see how the film was seen as perverse especiallly for its time.  While on her journey to the witch's coven, everyone little Lila comes across be it the priest or the ticket agent or the bus driver salivates over the possibilities of having intercourse with her and this is a girl that looks no older than 13.  And then there are the scenes of lesbianism with middle-aged Lemora who salivates over young children.

Make no mistake about it however, Lemora is very low budget replete with buildings that appear like cardboard cutouts and car scenes that you know were not filmed in cars.  No doubt at its time of filming it was meant to be little more than drive-in fodder.  Also while I loved Cheryl Smith's performance as little Lila the actress who plays Lemora was absolutely atrocious.  It was funny witnessing a middle-aged woman getting upstaged in every scene by a little girl.

Still, anyone who likes thick atmosphere and sleazy 70's euro-horror (although this particular one is American) will probably like ""Lemora"".  I know I sure did.  How can you not like a film that mixes influences of Lovecraft, George Romero, Brothers Grimm and the sleazy vampires of Jean Rollin?",1100217600,19,2701,4.718550106609808
2103472,5,B0002M5TRU,"Lemora has always been my favorite movie of all time, bar none. So I wanted, no

I NEEDED this DVD to be done perfectly! Don May Jr., President of Synapse Films,

assured me that it was indeed top quality. And yet, I had a twinge of fear when

first putting the DVD into the player. For over a year, I had followed the

development of this release, and my expectations (based on discussions with Don)

were very high indeed. And we all know what happens when your expectations are

set too high. In this case, they weren't set high enough! I was prepared for

this release to be excellent, but I never could have dreamed how great the

experience would actually turn out to be!

First, let me review the video quality. What Synapse did with the video transfer

of Lemora can only be described as miraculous. I don't feel this is an

exaggeration. They literally resurrected this film. Up until this DVD release, a

great many background details were obscured by darkness and murkiness to the

point where entire scenes were incomprehensible. The best VHS release still

looked like a murky 4th generation dub taped off a tv with bad reception. I

can't in all honesty even say that the DVD blows away all other versions,

because that would imply that there is a comparison to be made between them. The

Synapse DVD is so far above the rest that comparing it to others would be an

insult.

Scenes that were once literally blacked out and unviewable are now absolutely

clean and totally visible. Background details that were once lost in the

darkness are now crystal clear, sharply defined, and beautifully saturated in

deep, vibrant color. I can't name another film that's had a transfer done this

spectacularly. Lemora is pretty much reference quality, and then some.

The audio is in its original 2.0 mono, but even that has been cleaned up and is

utterly free of hiss or noise even at higher levels. I heard sounds that were

once muffled beyond recognition and are now crystal clear.

The animated main menu is the best I've ever seen, and all the various menus

look fantastic. The full length commentary track with Leslie Gilb (who played

Lemora), director Richard Blackburn, and producer Robert Fern is fun and

informative, with virtually no dead space at all. I consider commentaries to be

the most important extra a DVD can have, and this one was very well done and

worth listening to more than once.

The still gallery has some fantastic, rare continuity photos. These are to be

treasured, since obscure films such as this often have little to no extra

material.

The original shooting script is a valuable extra, and it shows how different the

final release was from the original script. The original script ends quite

differently and leaves no room for interpretation, whereas the movie release

leaves room for several interpretations of the film (did it actually happen, or

was it a fantasy/daydream?).

The movie itself is incredible, and my favorite of all time. Despite its low

budget, it pulls off what most modern movies fail utterly to do...it draws you

into the film. Its creepy, atmospheric quality has the effect of making you feel

as if you're viewing a child's nightmare, with all its surreal horror and fear.",1095292800,27,3252,4.740608228980322
2103473,5,B0002M5TRU,"I never saw this film until the DVD came out. What a surprise. If this ever made the drive-in rounds it was sadly overlooked. ""Lemora"" is a very unusual and intriguing story of a young girl Lila Lee (Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith), the innocent daughter of a notorious gangster, being lured to an isolated  mansion by a mysterious woman, Lemora (Lesley Gilb), with supernatural powers. Her journey there is beset by monsters and weird happenings. Once there, she slowly discovers what her destiny is. Gothic atmosphere and vampirism is vividly depicted and the woods surrounding the estate are overrun with mutants and other victims of a strange curse or ""disease"" caused by Asteroth...the Lovecraftian name of the area. The film is low budget but this is deftly handled with beautiful photography and striking use of color. ""Lemora"" is quite unlike any horror film of the period (70's) and being set in the 30's, you wouldn't know it was from that era thanks to the wonderful sets and costumes. The film is dedicated to the late Smith (who apparently died in 2002) and she is quite beautiful and amazingly innocent looking...perfect for the role. There are good extras featured---including interviews with Gilb and others involved in the film. All in all, ""Lemora"" is highly recommended for collectors of strange horror films and others who like an interestingly spooky tale. Synapse has done a great job and are commended for bringing this truly offbeat film it's due.",1094515200,41,1465,5.004098360655738
2103474,5,B0002M5TRU,"In past reviews, I've mentioned my nostalgic reverence for the drive-in horror movies of generations past that had low budgets but plenty of imagination and ingenuity. Such a movie was, and still is, ""Lemora."" In my mind, it is probably the quintessential drive-in horror movie, the epitome of what could be achieved when talented, inspired people got together and created cinematic alchemy. Sort of a nightmarish blending of LeFanu and Stoker and Lovecraft with ""Alice In Wonderland,"" I might have missed this movie totally, as it was sort of an innocuous blip on the late-night TV radar many years ago. Luckily, I did chance upon it, and it's haunted me ever since, even though the version I saw was heavily edited and loaded with commercials. Cheryl Smith was one of the great screen beauties of the 70's and my sincere hope is that with the release of this DVD, there will be a revival of interest in her career and she can achieve the illustrious status of such horror icons as Barbara Steele (with whom she co-starred in ""Caged Heat"") and Allison Hayes. There was an enigmatic and sad magic to her performances that Quentin Tarantino compared to that of Marilyn Monroe. Equally impressive is the performance of Lesley Gilb as ""Lemora."" She is alternately seductive and terrifying; playfully spiteful and maliciously brutal. It is a testament to the power and efficacy of her performance that she was able to accomplish this difficult feat despite the encumbrance of heavy wig, make-up and clothing. Like all great artistic works, the steadily increasing eerieness and occasionally non-linear quality of the storyline begins to function as a sort of funhouse mirror in which whatever pre-conceptions the viewer brings with him to the viewing experience are reflected back in subjectively distorted imagery. As Mr. Blackburn explains in the DVD commentary, there are those who see this as a Catholic film masquerading as a Protestant film, and those who see it as a Protestant film in the guise of a Catholic film. Then there are those agnostics like myself who will ignore the religious symbolism and experience it viscerally as the spooky, dark Fairytale for adults which it bills itself as. As previous reviewers have commented, the picture quality is superb and for the true fans of this cinematic gem, the commentary by Mr. Blackburn, Ms. Gilb, and Mr. Fern is priceless. Suffice it to say, this is one of my favorite vampire/horror movies of all time and the passage of 30 plus years has not lessened its effectiveness and emotional impact. This is one of those rare movies that will continue to haunt you long after you have seen it.",1094083200,37,2644,4.930493273542601
2103475,5,B0002M5TRU,"LEMORA, A CHILD'S TALE OF THE SUPERNATURAL has been my favorite film for years - and word of an official DVD release seemed like a dream came true when I first heard discussions about it several years ago.  I never could've imagined the brilliant work that Synapse has done with this cult masterpiece!  My all-time favorite movie is now available in the form of my all-time favorite DVD!  The film has been painstakingly remastered to return numerous lost pictorial details and brilliant saturated color and contrast to the video image.  It is absolutely flawless!  The soundtrack is also an improvement over the MANY VHS transfers I've acquired over the years.  They are all visually and audio-wise NOTHING compared to this breathtaking presentation!  In addition, the consumer receives a great and informative booklet, awesome and at times poignant commentary by director Richard Blackburn, producer Robert Fern and star Lesley Gilb, and a DVDrom of the original shooting script which I've yet to access.

And now for the film itself.  It's the kind of little-known, low-budget gem that I stumbled upon as a child on late-night TV, around 1977,  in the NYC area, that I've never forgotten!  With LEMORA, the initial viewing experience is so strange and hypnotic that it's like you've entered someone else's troubled dream state.  As time passed I asked myself, ""Did I REALLY see this movie, or did I imagine that I did?""  Upon repeated viewings it's like entering that haunting and foreign dreamworld all over again.

LEMORA is a rarity in that it should've been an exploitation horror film, but instead ended up being an artistic statement, with viewpoints about the dark side of emerging sexuality, repression and Catholic guilt - all expressed through the innocent eyes of a child, and using a Southern Gothic period backdrop!  This is ambitious stuff for a low-budget crew of first-timers!

Lila Lee (the late, great, Cheryl 'Rainbeaux' Smith) is a 13 year old church choir singer who is cared for by a devout minister (played by director Blackburn) in a small, Southern town in the 1930's.  When she receives a letter from a mysterious woman named Lemora (Lesley Gilb), who informs her that her gangster father is sick and in her care, Lila embarks on a strange and horrific journey 'into the woods' to find Lemora's home and reunite with her dad.  On the way she encounters a lecherous ticket seller, a scary bus driver who seems diseased, hideous forest dwelling mutants, and 'the old woman of skin and bone,' before meeting up with Lemora herself.  Lemora, a striking figure in black Victorian velvet and mink stoles, proves friendly and helpful at first, but soon reveals herself to be a vampire with a lesbian fixation towards Lila!

The imagery is hallucinogenic and vivid, the Victorian and period settings are meticulously arranged, the music is haunting and moving, and the sound effects of the mutants and forest are unforgettable!  Scenes are bathed in rich hues of midnight blue, Victorian purple and blood red, and there's enough unearthly atmosphere to overcome the film's minor flaws (the obvious low-budget, some slightly cheesy effects, and some over-the-top acting).

The result is a horror film of supreme visual poetry and sensitivity - and extremely ambitious for its time.  It's Charles Laughton's THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER meets H.P. Lovecraft meets ""Little Red Riding Hood"" meets the forgotten Tennessee Williams horror story that he never DID write!  Actually, what am I writing...LEMORA is simply LEMORA, pure and simple! Check out this unforgettable film ASAP - the way it was always meant to be seen!!!",1093737600,11,3635,5.040133779264214

2103501,2,B0002M5TRU,"1. The only actor in the film with talent is Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith... which is a relief, since she is the protagonist. Rainbeaux later had roles in several cult films... and a long-term addiction to heroin in real life. She died at age 47.

2. Filmed circa 1973. That is 40 years ago. If you are not familiar with cinema of that era and/or were weaned on CGI, Lemora may seem jarringly bad.

3. Lemora features highly stylized set design and is rich in allegory. View it abstractly if you find yourself getting bored. That said, the pace is slow, and this film is not for everyone (understatement of the year?)

4. According to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Vampire-Film/dp/0879103957/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Vampire Film</a>, Lemora was condemned by The Catholic Legion of Decency... which in itself makes the film worth watching.

5. If like me you are a vampire completist, then Lemora is simply required viewing. This is not to say you will enjoy it.

6. In case you didn't read the product description: ""New uncut uncensored anamorphic transfer supervised and approved by the director."" While the movie itself may not be enchanting, the video transfer is indeed fantastic. No black bars: the picture fills up the entire screen on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/screen/dp/B0098Y77N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">screen</a>.

7. The old hag witch character seems to be played by a man in drag. That it might actually be a woman is perhaps the most frightening aspect of the film. The credits state that The Old Woman is played by Maxine Ballantyne (Max the cross-dresser?)

8. The actress who plays Lemora was likely chosen for her facial features, not her talent. It may not be an acceptable tradeoff, but you can't say that her face isn't memorable.

9. The film has gone by several titles over the years, starting with The Legendary Curse of Lemora.

10. The price for this DVD on Amazon doesn't seem to drop below 10 bucks (new/sealed). It'd been on my wishlist for years, and I finally got tired of waiting for a price decrease that never came. Purchased instead of rented due to extras on the disc.

My advise: if you've never seen this film before, don't buy it until you've had a chance to see to it first (yes, I realize that's a bit counter-intuitive).

2103532,4,B0002M5TRU,"Made in the same year as THE EXORCIST, the low-budget LEMORA: A CHILD'S TALE OF THE SUPERNATURAL is a much more intelligently written and better paced look at innocence corrupted by means of a supernatural allegory of adolescence. Set in the Depression, the film has its core Lila Lee (Cheryl Smith), the beautiful daughter of a notorious gangster raised apart from him by an Evangelical minister (Richard Blackburn, who also wrote and directed the film) to sing in his church. A note from her ill father's caretaker, the mysterious Lemora, summons Lila to Astaroth, a backwoods small town hidden in the salt marshes where the degraded inhabitants are notorious for the ""Astaroth look,"" and where Lila is cared for (or held prisoner?) by the beautiful and eerie Lemora (Lesley Gilb).

The film seems in a long tradition of horror stories ranging from H. P. Lovecraft ""The Dunwich Horror"" to Sheridan le Fanu's ""Carmilla""; at the same time, it seems unlike anything else from its era. The art direction, sound direction, and color photography are remarkable; swathed in violets and blues, the lighting makes spectacular advantage of day-for-night photography carefully edited with actual nighttime scenes. There are a few bad directorial decisions (like the annoying montage sequence near the film's end), and most of the actors seem to have let Blackburn down, including Gilb, who possesses the requisite strange and statuesque beauty for the title role but sometimes vocally overacts (even though she tries for an affectless tone). But the director struck gold in the casting of the great young low-budget actress Cheryl Smith as Lila. Eighteen years old when the film was made, Smith (later a member of the famous band the Runaways) beautifully passes for a younger woman at the beginning of puberty; her straightforward, intuitive performance seems in another league entirely from most of the other actors in the film. Her genuine ability to convey fear, coupled with the director's fine ability to convey movement through space (both by mise-en-scene and by clever editing) make the multiple chases Lila endures by Lemora and her minions seem quite scary. The film deserves its cult reputation as one of the most unusual and beautiful horror films of the 70s.",1314403200,3,2263,5.132791327913279
2103533,4,B0002M5TRU,"I am keen on ""older"" vampire movies, before they started being shot on videotape.  Hence, I was surprised that I never heard of ""Lemora...""  First off, even after reading the mostly rave reviews about it, all I could think about was ""hmmm, isn't a lemora some kind of eel?""; as it was, I couldn't resist all the glowing reviews of this film.  Upon seeing it, I can't help but think that the majority of these reviews were, indeed, based upon nostalgia.  Viewers with any perspective whatsoever will immediately see this as something that would have had a memorable effect on any youngster who may have seen it.  In fact, as I've learned, it has a memorable effect on ANYone who sees it.  I'll give it this much: it is u-n-i-q-u-e!  The oddest effect it had on me was sleep inducement.  And that is not necessarly a ""bad"" thing, in this case.  I find it almost impossible to remain awake throughout this whole film, but not especially because it is boring (it is not, though it isn't exactly ""exciting"").  It creates this wave of hypnotic haze over me, matched only by Dreyer's ""Vampyr""... also find it hard or impossible to stay awake during that one.  These are the only 2 films which effect me this way, so take that for whatever it means (it must mean something).  Among many others, I consider ""Vampyr"" to be a landmark of genius, due to it's unquestionably eerie imagery, certainly not for it's driving narrative.  Perhaps the same can be said of ""Lemora"", as I certainly DO enjoy most of the imagery.  For me, this film, like ""Vampyr"", is a series of (to me) beautiful, haunting paintings, with the story being only secondary.  Because the story itself is quite abstract (yet easily ""understood"") and can be taken in several ways.  It is, in the end, HOKEY.  But it is endearing to all but the most ignorant ""gol, that ain't SCARY, there ain't no BLOOD!"" horror fan, even though you may have to watch it at least twice to become enchanted by it.  I would say that it IS a must-see, though it is not a favourite of mine by any means.  If not for the oozing originality and Bava-esque cinematography, or the quite attractive (can't believe nobody has yet mentioned the ""bathtub nipple"" sequence) Cheryl Smith (who sho'nuff don't look like no 13 year old!), I'd be giving this a 3 or even 2.  But it is unforgettable and original enough to warrant at least a 4. The woman that plays Lemora herself is equal parts enigmatic and awkward, perhaps creating an actual character rather than a caricature?  One of the indelible images of the film is her red-splotched cheekbones (like that rash/disease called rosacea or something like that)...intentional, or did she really have that affliction?  I'll also go along with what others said, that it certainly doesn't REALLY look like a '70s film, exactly, being meant as the 30s (in other words, no goofy fashions, hair, or music).Another forwarning to those who are influenced by the many glowing reviews: the ""anti-religion"" and ""lesbianism"" factors are a lot more subtle than blatant, but they are there.  A flawed, low-budget film that benefits from gorgeous photography, some memorably creepy(as well as a few ludicrous)characters/scenes, and a stamp of originality that elevates it to that ""must-see"" status.  And if you really, really, really like gloppy-faced forest-dwelling malformed beast men who act like those rowdy kids who ruined your junior-high Christmas pageant, it is ESSENTIAL viewing(yes, like many other reviewers I also am perplexed as to what they are meant to be)!",1288310400,6,3534,4.812913907284768

One review alluded to a TV movie--but, if TV movies were like this I wouldn't hate them so much!  This isn't ""Something Weird"" low-budget, this is ""Halloween"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" low-budget.

2103535,5,B0002M5TRU,"What a magical story.  Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural might just be the most fascinating journey ever captured on film.  I seldom recall being drawn into a fairy tale and feeling more bewildered and nervous about the outcome.  The innocent Lila Lee pulls you in close and has your heart screaming for her safe passage.

This movie is rated PG, but was banned upon its release in 1975.  It is easy to see the disruption this film caused, as it bends the genre elements way out of shape.  It's actually hard to classify this as a vampire film.  It feels much like a dark coming of age tale.  Maybe Alice in Wonderland meets Red Riding Hood.  It is filled with startling, controversial themes that continually dominate the mood.  Such dark, dreary aspects that sensationalize every step.  Much of the developments feel so surreal, it leaves you off-balance and in need of some support.

And then there is Lemora.

A more inviting, complex, and truly evil woman I have yet to see.  Creepy and totally wicked.

Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural is quite artistic and strikes me as very metaphorical.  You can't help but silently beg that Lila maintains her innocence in this dark, cruel world.

I love this film.  Totally blew me away.  Simply put, this is one of the most underrated horror films of all time.",1265328000,4,1325,4.658008658008658
2103536,5,B0002M5TRU,"""Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural"" is one of the best vampire films I've seen in a long time.  The fact that it escaped my notice this long aggravates me to no end.  Perhaps the fact that it was banned upon release in 1975 by The Catholic League of Decency (a more fascist name I could not imagine) in spite of it's mere PG rating and was barely seen in the United States until the mid-90's has led to the obscurity of what is easily one of the best female vampire stories ever told onscreen.  It's dark, dreary, surreal, somewhat perverse, and creepy as all hell.  Fellow vampire fanatics, this is not to be missed under any circumstance.

Our tale begins with a beautiful 13 year old girl singing in her church.  Her father is a notorious gangster who murdered her mother, her reverend has taken her in but is having trouble resisting temptation, the townsfolk are talking.  One night she receives a mysterious letter promising to take her to her ill father, who has been missing for months.  So out into the world young innocent Lila goes and all she sees is perversion and violence.  She gets on the bus as instructed by the letter and is taken to a house in a forest filled with deformed bestial ghouls. Within the house is an old woman servant, a large number of creepy laughing children, and her hostess, a pale woman named Lemora.  No shortage of mysteries for our adolescent protagonist to unravel here.

The first time we glimpse Lemora, she appears as a dark hooded feminine figure with only her contemptuously smiling mouth visible.  This is how you introduce a lady vampire, people.  The overall look of this film is so dark it gives Tim Burton nightmares.  The whole world seems tinted with blue and the naive blonde girl venturing through it gives a definite Alice in Wonderland feel to the story.  Except Alice never had snarling feral humanoid beasts figting for the privilege of feasting upon her or an enamored lesbian vampire bathe her.  The whole feel of this film just screams creepy.

I feel that this film has a bit of kinship with fellow cult classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Company-of-Wolves/dp/B00006G8H3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Company of Wolves</a>.  While that film used lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty this one uses vampirsim in much the same way.  The themes of both films heavily suggest a transformation from the innocence of youth and exploring one's self to an adult predator.  Both are  dark fairytales about young women venturing out into the world, finding it harsh and ugly, and eventually making it their own.  But unlike Wolves, Lemora doesn't lose itself in inscrutable symbolistic imagery and plays very much as a straightforward literal story which makes it much more watchable for casual viewers.

The film looks amazing considering how dark it is and brings to mind some of Argento's best work.  The film is must-see material for horror fans and is absolutely one of the best vampire films to come out of the 70's, which is saying a whole lot.  The ethereal atmosphere, pedophilic overtones, and black implications of humanity make this a bold classic that I am very happy to see it return from the dead.  Like the title character, stories like this one are unkillable and eternal.  I wish I could say this was a perfect film, but sadly the third act has some substantial pacing issues that keep it from my infinitesimal gallery of 5 star vamp flicks.  But it's not far off.

2103559,4,B0002M5TRU,"First, let me say that Synapse did an amazing job in the mastering process. The film is sharp with solid blacks and minimal grain. They went all out here.

Now, as for the movie, I have to say I found the film strange, almost surreal in its presentation. I've noticed other reviewers here and elsewhere describe Lemora as offbeat and I'd have to agree. The characters seem colorful in a supernatural way and I like the fact that the director didn't feel the need for extensive character development. I think if he did, there would be something lost in the movie's presentation.

Creep factor: Lemora is one of the creepiest vampires I've ever seen next to Nosferatu. She keeps children around as company and leans a bit toward lesbianism. However, the shape of her head and the speckled cheeks that the pancake makeup tries to conceal all add to the chill factor.

I understand the girl who plays Lila Lee, Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith, died of hepatitis in 2002. May she rest in peace.

Anyway, in the end, I don't feel this movie will be tolerated by just anyone. Sometimes, the pacing is slow and the production value is on the low side giving it a B-movie status, but I at least think it's worth a rental at the minimum.",1231459200,2,1220,4.557077625570776

2103562,4,B0002M5TRU,"(3.5/5 stars) For the most part, this movie is a very pleasant surprise. It is an unusual little horror movie, in which a young girl, Lila Lee, travels to her hometown in order to see her father. He has been evading authorities since he shot and killed his wife and her lover. Young Lila does not realize that the person holding her father is actually a vampire, who kidnapped him in order to lure the virginal Lila. There are many nice touches along Lila's Red Hiding Hood-like journey that make this film well worth watching, especially for horror fans. Cult favorite Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith is absolutely captivating in her role as Lila, her stoicism subduing (and practically hypnotizing) us throughout. (At twenty years old, she is actually passable as a thirteen year old)  Her bus ride would make J.K. Rowling proud. The film takes place during the 1930's, which seems odd, given the film's obviously low budget. They do succeed for the most part, though, and deserve extra credit for trying. There are a few aspects of the film I find distracting, however. Some of the acting is truly bad and amateurish, especially Hy Pike's outlandish overacting as the Bus Driver and Maxine Ballantyne as the Old Woman. Although she does a halfway decent job, she looks far too young to play a decrepit, demented old gal in her phony gray wig. She actually fairs slightly better than most of the crazed loonies, whose make-up unfortunately is very poorly done.

This is less a horror film than a twisted fairy tale (little girl lost in the woods, kept prisoner in a strange house, with demonic children and a presiding witch figure, who is a vampire). There's a bit of anti-religious feeling to the film, which got it condemned by the Catholic church. What better recommendation is there?
