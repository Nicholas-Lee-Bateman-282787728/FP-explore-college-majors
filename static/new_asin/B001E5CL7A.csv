3545964,5,B001E5CL7A,The dvd's came quickly and we have enjoyed watching them. It's wonderful to have everything in order since we missed the first 2 seasons.,1238976000,,137,4.75
3545965,1,B001E5CL7A,"Of course, all Bones episodes are great.  This collection is disappointing because it is incomplete.  the disks do not have all the episodes listed on the jackets, missing about 30%.  the image also goes light and dark constantly, mostly dark.",1238889600,9,243,5.025
3545966,5,B001E5CL7A,"When the weather is cold, my husband and I look for things to watch, and this has been one of our favorites.",1234915200,,108,3.9545454545454546
3545967,5,B001E5CL7A,This series is fabulous! It's worth the price if only to have it available every time you want to watch it.,1233878400,,107,4.142857142857143
3545968,5,B001E5CL7A,"Bones is an exceptional show. Anyone, especially those who love science, will find this show intriguing. Everyone cannot help but love Bones/Booth relationship. However, the single season DVDs are the way to go. I rate all of them highly, once you start, you just can't stop watching. The team that Brennan has backing her and Booth are also exceptional and without the team, Brenna could not possibly accomplish everything they set out to do. You can buy all separately for at most 100 bucks. There is no need to buy all three in one set.",1231718400,,539,4.684210526315789
3545969,5,B001E5CL7A,"this is my husbands favorite show except for monk. i have been reading the books for years and love them. this tempy is yonger and no daughter or crazy sister, but a good show to watch over and over. i can conplain about one thing. we do not have surround sound and the dvds are ment to use it. the background noise is too loud and sometimes drowns out the spoken word. we just turn it up louder and enjoy.",1229731200,,406,4.0875
3545970,5,B001E5CL7A,Now I get to see season 1 and 2.  I think Bones is great,1228435200,,56,3.0
3545971,1,B001E5CL7A,"Also on sale singly for $25.49, $21.49 and $37.99, the first three seasons only total $84.79.  Why is the complete set of the three seasons marked up an additional 61%?  There are no additional materials listed in the package.  Even if the Bones Companion were added, at under $11, it wouldn't come close to making up the additional premium.  I think it would have to come in a REALLY cool case, complete with forensic anthropology tools to justify this price point.

Save your money. Buy them separately. Watch the same shows.",1228089600,31,527,4.747252747252747
3545972,1,B001E5CL7A,"I am very upset with my order from amazon.  I never received the product in the mail.  I contacted the seller and he replied that it was probably delivered to my post office.  My post office stated they delivered the product on 3/11/10, but I never received it.  I have been charged on my credit card for this.  I have ordered numerous times in the past from amazon without any problems. I would think that the seller would have this insured for times like this.  I am very disappointed with this whole matter and will NEVER order from amazon again.  I will go elsewhere to do my shopping.",1271203200,,589,4.398148148148148
3545973,5,B001E5CL7A,"I already liked the show, the DVD's were delivered on time, & well packaged, I'm really enjoying these.",1268956800,,103,4.777777777777778
3545974,5,B001E5CL7A,I started watching the show on TV and I liked it so well that I wanted to order all the seasons and catch up. Catch up I did. I LOVE this show. The items were in perfect condition and arrived when the seller said they would. Absolutely nothing but thumbs up for this series.,1268870400,,274,4.092592592592593
3545975,5,B001E5CL7A,"The episodes of ""bones"" contained in this DVD set are absolutely awesome.  Very creative, maintains interest throughout - great series!!!",1262995200,,137,5.85
3545976,2,B001E5CL7A,I enjoy the BONES series and was excited to get seasons 1-3 until I discovered that the episodes were burned on both sides of the discs and the B side of the disc consistently breaks up halfway through one or both of the episodes.  Major disappointment!,1254614400,3,253,4.5
3545977,5,B001E5CL7A,"Bones is one of the BEST shows on TV! The writing is great and the storylines are interesting. But what makes this an exceptional show, in my opinion, is the interaction between all the major characters. There is such a wonderful camraderie -- it's like looking in the windows and watching a loving family. I watch these episodes over and over and never get bored.",1252627200,,364,4.615384615384615
3545978,5,B001E5CL7A,"Awesome show, great chemistry, stories, romance, action... it's got it all. David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel are great leading actors with superb chemistry. I just love it.",1252627200,,174,5.481481481481482
3545979,5,B001E5CL7A,Bones is terrific. My Wife and I watched it new and watch the reruns on TV as background stuff while doing other things. Now we watch the dvds. Very fun.,1252195200,,153,4.133333333333334
3545980,5,B001E5CL7A,"""Bones"" is the most consistently entertaining forensics TV series ever produced, and ""Bones: Seasons 1-3"" is a wonderful way to watch a terrific show improve, and grow, over four seasons (the first four episodes of Season 4 are also included in the collection). While the decomposing corpses that open each episode aren't for the squeamish, please bear with it; once the real investigations begin, and the ""squints"" start putting the pieces together (sometimes LITERALLY!), you'll find yourself 'hooked'!

Created by Hart Hanson (based on the novels and career of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs), the series offers the irresistable pairing of brilliant scientist Dr. Temperance 'Bones' Brennan (smart, sexy Emily Deschanel) and her partner, hunky FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (""Angel's"" David Boreanaz); the chemistry between the pair is simply perfect, a mix of humor, conflicting beliefs, adolescent bickering, and thinly-veiled attraction. They could 'carry' the series by themselves, but ""Bones"" is also blessed with one of the best supporting casts on TV, as Brennan's team of ""squints""; exotic Michaela Conlin as Bones' free-spirited artist best friend; T.J. Thyne as the millionaire 'bug guy' in love with Conlin; Tamara Taylor as the lab chief (and Booth's ex-girlfriend); wonderful Eric Millegan as Bones' geeky, if genius young assistant; and John Francis Daley as the enthusiastic, youthful psychologist Bones and Booth constantly pick on. The cast is a family in the best sense of the word, and certainly improves an already superb series.

Special praise should be given to a few recurring guest stars; the legendary Ryan O'Neal, as Bones' estranged criminal father, is as likable a rogue as has ever graced the small screen, and Loren Dean, as her older brother, is nearly as good. Ty Panitz is adorable as Booth's son, Parker, and Patricia Belcher, as a smart-talking, no-nonsense D.A., has turned a small role into a welcome highlight. Jonathan Adams, who portrayed the erudite archeologist/lab chief in Season One, also deserves recognition; while he never 'fit' as well as Taylor would, in the mix, he was wonderful.

Incredible special effects (those corpses do look real!), genuinely frightening villains (especially a serial cannibal and a murderer who buried victims alive), satisfying subplots, and a healthy dose of irreverence (watch the 'Dead Santa' episode and try NOT to laugh), make ""Bones: Seasons 1-3"" a constant pleasure, and the Special Features reveal that the cast and crew are every bit as likable as the characters on-screen.

This is a 'keeper', and worth the price!",1246924800,8,2612,5.347931873479319
3545981,5,B001E5CL7A,"Great Show! Interesting characters with good chemistry especially Temperence and Booth. Once you start watching, one episode just isn't enough. I highly recommend it. I have preordered season 4 if that tells you anything.",1246147200,,221,5.529411764705882
3545982,5,B001E5CL7A,I just started watch Bones during the fourth season and wanted to catch up so I bought the first three on DVD....  I really enjoy the characters and the interactions between them.  The storylines are interesting and keep you guessing not only about the murders and mysteries surrounding the bones that are found each episode but also about what will happen with the characters you've grown to know and love.,1246060800,,407,4.8
3545983,5,B001E5CL7A,this is a great show. you will learn a lot about this show. the people that produce this show know there stuff.,1245974400,,111,4.090909090909091
3545984,4,B001E5CL7A,"Let me start off by saying that I haven't watched all of these yet. I'm about halfway through the second season (and have been enjoying every episode so far).

Overall it's a great series. It's almost a CSI, but with humor thrown in. The humor adds a nice element to what could be a depressing series. On top of that there's the unspoken love/crush connection between Bones and Booth which adds even more to the series.

The one complaint I have is about the first season DVD's. They're 2-sided DVD's with 4 episodes on one side and 2 episodes on the other. While it's great that this makes the season take up less shelf-space, I found it annoying (and oddly confusing) to have to turn the DVD's over and put them back in the player. I was glad to see they changed the format for seasons 2 and 3.",1245974400,,796,4.3355704697986575
3545985,5,B001E5CL7A,Bones is a series which involves an ensemble cast who interact to perfection.  The mysteries they solve are interesting but it really is the people and their quirks that make the show.,1245801600,,184,4.75
3545986,3,B001E5CL7A,"I purchases this series for my daughter who is a real ""Bones"" nut!  She is very happy with the product and the quick turnaround time it took to arrive.  Excellent service!",1245024000,,171,4.483870967741935
3545987,5,B001E5CL7A,"Very entertaining and well put together show.  I would highly recommend BONES.  All three seasons are very good, and the DVDs have special features and extras.  Also, unlike other shows like LOST, you can watch any one episode without having to follow some extensive, multi-layered plot line that makes no sense.  The two main characters really make the show.  If you don't like gross things, then maybe this show is not for you, but it is usually only the first 5-10 minutes that show any 'bones'.  This show doesn't get a lot of publicity, but it is much better than the CSI shows that seems to be everywhere now.",1243555200,,615,4.5963302752293576
3545988,4,B001E5CL7A,"Product arrived in great condition, exactly as advertised, at a very attractive price.  Would recommend the faster delivery for extra bucks if it matters.  It took the full 15 days for delivery at the base rate and that was just going from the east coast to Wisconsin.",1243123200,,268,4.680851063829787
3545989,5,B001E5CL7A,"First off, some of the discs in this collection are double sided, so you will need to flip the disc to view every episode (when they aren't on Side A at least).  I received the three seperate season boxes, which were shrink-wrapped together.  It is true that sometimes you will be able to buy them seperately at a better price, as well as times when you will be able to buy this bulk pack at a less expensive price.  It would have to go to your discretion on whether to buy them seperately or together, because the prices for this set, and the seperate seasons, fluctuate.

The first season I saw was mid season 2, and it's interesting to see how the series evolved from being based more on scientific information, to a mix of science and comedy.  My only complaint to this set is that season one doesn't have a ""Play-All"" option, so you are required to return to the main menu and then navigate the episode menu to play each episode.  This series is fun to watch, even when the episode is shifted towards the forensics instead of the comedy.",1243036800,5,1042,4.401041666666667
3545990,5,B001E5CL7A,"I caught an episode of Bones and got hooked.  To have 4 "" Brainiacs "" in the same room without an "" EGO "" problem and have Booth be the Salt, or the Pepper, or both, makes for very interesting viewing.  I did not see any episodes in 2005 but have since caught up and am anxiously awaiting the next episode this coming Thursday.....!!!!!",1241136000,,336,4.234375
3545991,5,B001E5CL7A,loved the series and am so happy to be caught up. my product arrived earlier than expected and my son and I were able to enjoy time together.,1240272000,,141,4.071428571428571
8296522,5,B001E5CL7A,"Season 1: Review: Bones is a really good show.

8296525,5,B001E5CL7A,"I have loved.this series since I first watched it. The gritty chemistry between the chacter Bones & Booth is fantastic. The show is a mix of gumshoe detective(Booth) & brillant forsensics/anthropoligist (Bones), their quest to solve crimes. I have also enjoyed the growth of other members of the cast. Great series. Now the quality of the DVD is better than others I've come across.",1344211200,,382,4.984375
8296526,5,B001E5CL7A,"Bones may be one of the best shows on television right now.  The premise is that Dr Brennan, a forensic anthropologist, teams up with FBI agent Booth to solve murders using only the victims bones as a clue.  Even though this sounds a bit morbid, the show is laced with humor and sexual tension between the main characters that create a well rounded story.  I highly recommend this show to everyone!",1322870400,,398,4.577464788732394

8296529,5,B001E5CL7A,They are good at surprising you. It don't always go the way you think it will. (Sometimes it does.) Great show love all the regular actors. Usually something diffrent thrown in the episodes so its not always same old thing. Its not all about the bones.,1285200000,,252,4.5

8296531,3,B001E5CL7A,"I loved the first couple of seasons as they were more science based stories and Zack was still in the series, but the seasons just seem to get stupider as they go. The later seasons are almost laughable but not in a good way.",1271289600,,225,4.136363636363637
