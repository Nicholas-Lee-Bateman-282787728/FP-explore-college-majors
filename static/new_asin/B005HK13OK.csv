4702038,4,B005HK13OK,"The Criterion folks released a Blu ray transfer of this 1939 film in November, 2011.  They used a copy of the film as the original was destroyed in WW II.  It looks very good with the 1080p transfer and the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  Here are Criterion's production notes as they provided: ""The original negative for the film was destroyed during a World War II bombing raid. In 1959, with Jean Renoir's approval, the movie was reconstructed by Jean Gaborit and Jacques Durand, resulting in today's renowned 106-minute version. In preparation for the original DVD release of The Rules of the Game, Criterion searched at length for a 35mm fine-grain master processed directly from the negative of Gaborit and Durand's reconstruction, and one was finally located at the French film lab GTC in 2003. This high-definition digital transfer of the fine-grain master was created on a Spirit Datacine. Due to the nature of the reconstruction, which is comprised of elements from various sources, there are noticeable variations in quality; nonetheless, this version is made from the best existing materials. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, and scratches, were removed using MTI's DRS both in 2003 and 2011.""

In addition Criterion provides a LPCM mono soundtrack in French and only with English subtitles.  Here are their notes regarding the very listenable audio: ""The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35mm magnetic audio track. Clicks, thumps, hiss, and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.""

There is quite a list of special features including:  A 33 page booklet filled with essays and letters by Renoir and others involved in the film.  It includes numerous tributes and accolades by filmmakers and critics.  On the disc, there is an audio commentary, numerous interviews, documentaries, video essays, a TV program and more.

If I have a complaint with the Criterion presentation it has to do with the subtitled graphics.  They are white and while there may be some consideration to not stand out against the black and white film, there are numerous scenes where they are hard to read.  In fact, the opening sequence, director Jean Renoir provides a written narrative, in French of course, to set up the scenario.  The white English subtitles blend in with the background making them nearly indecipherable.  In addition, this is a film full of characters who are often talking at the same time, so the subtitles are quick and sometimes hard to follow (yes I can read relatively fast).  Perhaps a pale yellow would have made it easier.

When this movie was released, Hitler and his thugs were about to envelop Europe.  The French audiences hated the movie.  There is some debate about why.  Too much poking fun at the upper class rich?  Concern over Nazi perception?  Against killing animals?  I don't know.  But the film was a flop and pulled from theaters.  Years later upon its resurrection, the movie seems to have reached acclaim that few had.  Many critics consider this to be the best movie ever made.  Modern filmmakers credit the film with their own career successes.  I don't fall into either camp.

Technically the film is masterful.  I appreciate the large spaces, both inside and out.  I appreciate a screen full of characters, usually interacting.  I appreciate the long sequences filmed in one shot.  The film is not choppy and flows nicely.  The story is essentially a satire of two classes of the French civilization.  One is the upper crust where every action is a formal one.  Gowns, jewelry and tuxes with tails are the usual attire for evening events.  The working class intermingles throughout the film, usually as employees.

Both sets of characters have numerous affairs and it's hard to keep who's sleeping with whom in context.  The infidelities are handled differently however.  With the rich, it appears that marriage is a matter of business or convenience.  Dalliances are common and accepted as long as they are not flaunted.  With the working class on the other hand, it can provoke armed combat.  The acting is OK but not exceptional, but for Paulette Dubost as Lisette, the married hand maid for the Marchioness (Nora Gregor, an actual princess) and Julien Carette as a new servant who pursues Lisette.  They provide some natural performances and comedic naughtiness. Renoir himself has a key role as Octave, a bit of a jester who gets in over his head.

As for the famous (infamous?) animal hunt.  Well, I'm kind of in between here too.  Certainly setting up the scene would seem to have its challenges.  As the Marquis (Marcel Dalio) assembles his guests for a casual hunt of bird and rabbit, there seems to be no concern as to whether they can handle a rifle or shotgun or how they are positioned.  Once the corralled animals are turned loose we get about a minute of shooting and get to watch the wounded animals twitch in their final seconds.  Hmm.  Obviously there was no PETA on site.  Fair to kill dozens of animals for the sake of a movie?  You decide.  As for the film, sure it has a place in history, but at the top of the heap?  I don't think so.  Film rating: 3 1/2 stars.  Criterion rating: 4 1/2 stars.",1347148800,,5260,4.888009049773756
4702039,5,B005HK13OK,"The Rules of the Game is a french ""comedy of manners"" directed by Jean Renoir.  It is about the immoral and reckless behavior of the french upper class just before the start of World War II.  As you can imagine, this sparked a lot of controversy in 1939, and one person even attempted to burn down the theater at the premiere.  This film was thought to have been destroyed in an allied bombing during WWII, but was rediscovered and reconstructed in 1959.  All I can say is that this film is a treasure to behold and is one of the greatest I have ever seen.  Neither Gone with the Wind, not The Wizard of Oz are the best films of 1939, this one is, as well as the best of the entire decade of the 1930s.",1346976000,,702,4.132352941176471
4702040,5,B005HK13OK,"So much carefully chosen detail and so many layers - to be able to craft so many aspects of the human condition in this brief weekend gathering of characters - and in so doing providing commentary on collective and individual failings and triumphs using what was at the time such a young medium really is quite amazing. Renoir's ability comes through and reminds us of the art that can result when a film maker respects his audience and is willing to consider our abilities to see, hear, feel and think, - using them as part of his instruments of production - sadly such a contrast to most films in 2012 - ""The Rules of the Game"" its worth viewing several times over the years - so refreshing.",1346976000,,693,4.464566929133858
4702041,5,B005HK13OK,"Jean Renoir's iconic Rules of the Game (La Rgle du jeu) is considered one of cinema's great films.  In fact, many critics and film periodicals and websites list this film among the 100 greatest ever produced.  The film bends genres, having comedic elements while being a drama at it's heart.  It has a hint of the absurd, though nothing as over the top as the later French New Wave films.  It is well known that Jullian Fellowes and Robert Altman took much influence from this film for the film Gosford Park.  There are several remarkable similarities, only a slight difference in the 'surprise' at the ending.  This film does feature a hunt (pheasant and rabbit though) and several scenes centered around the servants, highlighting what the British call ""Upstairs/downstairs"".

The relationships at first seem confusing.  After awhile it all becomes clearer when you realize that pretty much all of the principal characters are romantically involved with each other.  So here goes a quick summary of the romantic entanglements (to help you out).  Lord Robert Cheyniest is married to the Austrian Christine de la Cheyniest.  Christine has been having an affair with pilot Andr Jurieux.  Andr's friend is Octave (played by Jean Renoir himself) and he is having an affair with Christine's maid Lisette.  Lisette is married to Robert's gamekeeper Edouard Schumacher.  Genevive de Marras is the mistress of Lord Robert and also has had an affair with several other characters (implied rather than stated).  Phew.

Much of the story revolves around the difficulty in all of the characters keeping their affairs private from others.  Though most know about the affairs (such as Lord Robert being aware that his wife has been with Jurieux), they keep these events private to be clear of public scandal.  As events progress, several characters mention that if two of the unattached characters would just pair up, then most of the confusion would be solved.

The 'Rules' are the unstated social mores surrounding the affairs of the Bourgeoisie. When one character begins talking of running off with another, Octave tells him ""You can't do that, it's against the rules!  You can't run off with one man's wife after he welcomes you into his house and shakes your hand!"".  And it's these little rules that keep the silly affairs from getting out of hand.  When a couple of characters actually try to break the rules, there are unforeseen repercussions due to a case of mistaken identity.  You'll understand when the film had ended.  I do not want to spoil anything.

I really didn't enjoy the hunt scene, since it actually looked like real footage from a real hunt.  Nowadays there are restrictions on actually killing animals on screen, but in 1939 those rules didn't exist, especially in Europe.  So just be aware that there is quite the rabbit slaughter in the middle of the film.

The film was shot in regular 4:3 ratio.  The restoration is nothing short of spectacular.  It is based on the 106 minute restoration approved by Renoir in 1959.  Criterion has included a remarkable list of special features. Included are the following (and more):  audio commentary, comparison of the two alternate endings, selected scene analysis by a Renoir historian, excerpts from a French television program based on the film, part one of the Jean Renoir BBC documentary (1993), video essays, discussion on the restoration, interviews with Renoir's son, Renoir's set designer, actress Mila Parly (Genevive de Marras), and a 24 page booklet with writings by Renoir, Truffaut, and others.

Criterion has brought an amazing film to restored glory.  It is a film that touches on so many themes, but at it's heart is about the people.  Characterization was always a strong point of Renoir's, and this film is splendid in that regard.  Renoir himself turns in a masterful performance.  The rest of the cast is spot on and their acting nearly perfect.  It is an enjoyable film that hasn't lost a bit of it's charm in over 70 years since its release.  One of the best pre-war French films in my opinion.",1342828800,,4072,4.941089837997055
4702042,5,B005HK13OK,"One of those films that the world tells you that you need to see because it is a masterpiece, `The Rules of the Game' is actually just that; a masterpiece.  I was skeptical at first, mainly because my understanding of French politics is very little and the film itself was basically panned by French critics for being too controversial and or critical of the French socialites and so I was afraid this would sail over my head (and I'm sure much of it actually did) but by the film's third act I was completely absorbed in what I could comprehend and smitten with every frame.  I won't compare this with `Grand Illusion', which I had seen a few years ago and found slightly underwhelming (still very good but not what I had hoped for), for I feel that despite some directorial similarities the films are really different in tone and impact.

The basic premise follows a group of individuals who spend a weekend hunting at a prominent man's mansion.  Philanderers, love sick third wheels, trouble making servants and gossip hounds litter the mansion and cause a stir in more ways than one.  As the film pans over these characters (there really is no lead and thus every plot point and relationship is given air to breathe) we are given a taste of life at its most chaotic and thus most natural.  As the world around them is up in arms about political upheavals, these `cultured' men and women are wasting away in a sea of debauchery that consumes their every thought.

This satire is a beautiful balance of wit, charm and dramatic conveyance, and it works on every level.  The direction is sharp and underscores every subtle complexity perfectly, and the acting is sublime.  Jean Renoir has double duty here, directing and acting in the film, and his portrayal of Octave is easily the film's best and certainly the most memorable of the lot (the way he plays with tragic and comedic to depth perfection is astonishing).

It is easy to tell someone `this film is a masterpiece'.  The cinematically curious are often guided in their viewing endeavors by `best of lists' and Oscar references in order to carve out a nice body of films they can feel proud to have seen.  `The Rules of the Game' lands on a lot of those `best of lists' and is highly regarded as a masterpiece, now that it is viewed out of the context of the times in which it was debuted.  While I have raised Cain with regard to certain films not deserving that `masterpiece' title (1939 is also a year where I contest the `big' movie everyone loves so dearly) I must say that `The Rules of the Game' certainly deserves that mention.  It isn't my favorite film of that particular year (seriously people, did no one see `Beau Geste'?) but it is one of the best the film year had to offer, and should be seen by all attempting to broaden their cinematic horizons.",1341187200,,2822,4.562376237623762

4702048,4,B005HK13OK,"For a film that endured so many indignities such as massive cuts shortly after its release and then complete destruction during the Second World War Criterion did as good a job as possible on the best master that has been uncovered so far.  The picture quality of this restored film which comes closest to Renoir's vision isn't perfect with imperfections on many frames but it could have been a lot worse like the very poor alleged restoration by Kino of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Les-Vampires-2-Disc-Kino-Classics-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B0083Q4K68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Les Vampires: 2-Disc Kino Classics Edition [Blu-ray</a>].

In one of the excellent special feature interviews we get Renoir himself talking about how easily mankind are willing to sacrifice innocents just to keep up a belief or a way of life that is threatened in any way which is shown in the final tragic scenes as well as the hunting scene.  Also exposed are the double standards where the bourgeousie appear to get away with behaviour deemed not acceptable among the peasants.  Even today when people in order to preserve even ""religious"" beliefs feel it is justified to kill innocents or in fighting terrorism collatoral damage among the innocents is also deemed acceptable.  Compare this with the sacrifice of virgins to appease ""gods"" like solar eclipses for example throughout ancient history.  This film as a true classic appears to remain relevant today and in a way unfortunately remains timeless.  The marquis' obsession and love of inanimate toys leading to his neglect of his long-suffering wife who craves attention and an ideal of romantic love that her husband cannot provide as well as the jealous love of a gameskeeper for his wife who clearly doesn't love him in return that leads to tragic consequences run parallel among various storylines thoughout this film alternating between comedy and tragedy which is probably what led to the rejection of the film by the public upon its release who couldn't really understand just what to make of this film.  One line near the end when the marquis asks his head servant to put and end to the farce and the retort was ""which one sir?"" very aptly sums up the almost screwball nature of this comic tragedy.

Overall this is a classic film and while not perfect and certainly not the best Criterion release is still probably the best version that is out there and likely to be for some time to come.",1374537600,5,3523,5.678707224334601

4702053,4,B005HK13OK,"- five stars for the film.  This is a disappointing blu-ray release from the normally exemplary Criterion.  What we have here is the 1959 reconstruction of the film conservatively cleaned up.  But the fact is, the 1959 reconstruction is in need of some very up to date digital restoration.  This would be a major job and Criterion has not attempted it. One obvious example:  the 1959 reconstruction was assembled from multiple prints, since the original camera negative was apparently destroyed.  So there are many variations in brightness and contrast.  These could be evened out with a digital restoration.

Although this blu-ray is certainly the best version available at present for home viewing, a side by side comparison on a 42"" monitor showed barely perceptible differences from the 2004 Criterion issue.  An upgrade to the blu-ray is recommended only if you have a 60""+ HDTV or a DLP projector.

8473203,5,B005HK13OK,"My favorite film. Indescribably so. Essential movie magic. Pure joy. Contrary to popular belief, you don't get to choose your favorite film after a period of considerable debate, your favorite film chooses you within the first five minutes. The Rules Of The Game is absolute perfection. Mammoth in feel and serenely beautiful in texture. The film is so perfect that it is unreal. A film lover's dream. The Rules of The Game is a comic tragedy that transcends and blooms. A film that is destined to glow. The Rules Of The Game burns bright and blooms still. An unending magic.

It is the most remarkably photographed film of all time. This is not a matter of personal opinion, it is an irrefutable fact. The Rules Of The Game is utterly indispensable. It is the best photographed, the best choreographed, and the best written film ever made. Once again, FACT. If you have any doubts concerning the film's assembly, I must insist that have your brain checked immediately for you have obviously fallen gravely ill. Renoir's assembly is a flawless one, miraculous and magical. A slapstick tango of duality. A perfectly balanced choreography. Renoir's vision is that of the ballerina and the absurd tragedy.

Stylistically speaking, The Rules Of The Game is a lesson in Jung's synchronicity. It is a mosaic piece. One where everything is glorious, glowing, and supreme. The Rules of The Game is a film beyond perfection. It is a deep focus glance into the magical realm of a warm and cascading infinity. Renoir casts several spells and The Rules Of The Game is bound to hypnotize by way of immaculate design.

All of the performances in The Rules Of The Game are extraordinary but there is one that towers over the rest. Marcel Dalio as Marquis Robert de La Chesnaye is one of the most inspired and perfect performances of all time. Dalio is an incredibly gifted actor with a strong and viable understanding of character. He plays a man who collects mechanical toys and trinkets. Some of his toys are quite boring, some are frenzied, most are unsettling, and all of them bring him happiness and security. It is a mostly quiet pleasure derived from the inanimate, the inarticulate, and the nonsexual. His most prized possession is a manic jukebox of light and sound, dolls and noise. It is a giant music box that he showcases with great pride, almost with honor and a hint of patriarchal approval. The people he surrounds himself with are also mostly mechanical. They are robotic and Dalio takes great joy in winding them up. He is the king of the playground and everything is his toy, all a part of his collection. Dalio's performance is one of extreme care and perfection. Evenly balanced with hilarity and sincerity, Dalio glows. A perfect performance for a perfect film.

The Rules Of The Game means the world to me and is the definitive reason why I love film. It is pure magic and very special. A one of a kind movie miracle. The Rules Of The Game is the best film of all time. Easily. Indescribably so. Magically.",1410480000,7,3014,4.7352380952380955
