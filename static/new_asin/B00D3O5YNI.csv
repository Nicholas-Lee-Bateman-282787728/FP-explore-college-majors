8589100,5,B00D3O5YNI,"Although the John Dexter/James Levine rendition of ""Lulu,"" available from Amazon at roughly half the price, should probably be your 'basic' version of the opera, in part because it contains Friedrich Cerha's realization of Act III, this Vienna live telecast is a buried treasure of great value. It represents the Austrian premiere of the work, under the baton of one of Alban Berg's most loyal champions, Karl Bohm. Admittedly, both the orchestra and singers are somewhat inexact in what must have been, almost 55 years ago, very difficult music. (This has its unplanned compensations: the heavy vibrato of the saxophonist makes his contributions sound that much more louche.) Otto Schenk's production would be called ""traditionalist"" were he not helping to create the tradition from which others would later deviate. Other than the Dexter staging, this is your best chance to see ""Lulu"" as Berg wrote it ... not that some of the more interventionist productions, such as Zurich's (with the superb Laura Aiken) don't provide food for thought.

As should the case, Evelyn Lear's Lulu is first among equals, exuding fatal fascination in tones of ripest floral quality and preferable (for this viewer) to all others. Well past 60, Paul Schoeffler still makes a handsome-sounding Dr. Schon, his expertise as Wotan and Hans Sachs showing in the authoritative nuances of his rendition. Rudolf Schock is mostly associated with operetta, a poor man's Fritz Wunderlich, but rises capably to the fierce challenges of Alwa and Kurt Equiluz distinguishes himself as the Painter. Only Gisela Litz's Countess Geschwitz is a serious disappointment. Picture quality is B- but you're getting history in the making. Many thanks to Arthaus for this invaluable excavation.",1466380800,,1752,5.279569892473118
8589101,5,B00D3O5YNI,"My first recording of LULU was with Lear on DGG back in the early 70's. I always wished I could have seen her in the part. Here it is! She doesn't disappoint. The only unfortunate thing is this performance took place before the third act was completed by Cerha so it is not entirely complete by today's standards but who cares when the performance is as well sung as it is here, beautifully acted, and treating the opera as the story that Berg intended to tell, not updating it to some nonsensical directors thoughts about what the opera might be about. Highly recommended!!!!",1402099200,2,576,4.601941747572815
8589102,5,B00D3O5YNI,"Really a wonderful and historial performance!! I've always wanted to be able to see Lear's Lulu. It's truly a miracle that we can watch this historical performance today!! Thank you for releasing this on DVD!!  5 stars for the cast, director, staging and performance. Bravo!",1386288000,2,274,5.088888888888889
8589103,5,B00D3O5YNI,"I had no idea this video existed let alone was commercially available!!  Too bad the third act was not yet allowed to be completed and performed.

Lear is wonderful as I expected, but I didn't think either Schock or Schoeffler ever ventured into this musical territory.  They perform it as if they were doing it all their lives.  Too bad they weren't cast for the DGG recording.  Fischer-Dieskau is good; but Schoeffler is superior.

Bohm provides his usual insightful, clear and transparent direction.

This is a must have for all ""Lulu"" lovers out there.",1379635200,7,556,4.851063829787234
8589104,5,B00D3O5YNI,"How fortunate we are to have this performance of Berg's opera on DVD!! There is a warning about the quality of the picture due to the year in which this performance took place, but the quality is still much greater than acceptable.

We have here the magnificent Evelyn Lear singing the title role of Lulu.  What a great singer-actress she was!  Along with her we have Paul Schoeffler as Dr. Schon and Rudolf Schock as his son Alwa.  The other singers are well-known people from that period.  The conducting of Karl Boehm combined with the singing and acting makes this whole performance a wonderful listening and visual experience.

Even if you own other DVD performances of this work, it is still worth getting this one. Very highly recommended !!",1377561600,10,748,4.75968992248062
