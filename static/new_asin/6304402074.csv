862606,3,6304402074,"This is an entertaining picture, but certainly not the best. The poor budget is reflected in almost every aspect.
The first few scenes glow with colors only possible through Technicolor, but after that the picture  looks pretty standard.
The story has a crew of an experimental rocket  being sent on a journey to the Red Planet, but meteor damage causes  malfunctions that lead to a crash landing on Mars.
The crash of the  spaceship is pretty poorly done, and the Martain cityscape will be painful  to watch unless you're a very young viewer (flat cardboard cut-out travel  cars and elevators seen from the wrong angles!).
The acting? Well...  depends. I liked the two older professors in the crew, and the Martian bad  guy.
There are some interesting gender issues, most notibly the  overwhelming desire of the female crewmember to see the Martian version of  a kitchen. For brainy scientists, the two leading female cast members still  seem easily sidetracked by such things.
I think the best part of the  picture is the first half; the flight preparations, getting to know the  crew, and the interesting dialogue about Man's place in the universe that  is discussed during the flight.
The ship tangles with the Moon's  gravity, and the obligatory glowing meteor fragments, before crashing on  Mars.
Once the crew meets the Martains and enters the elevator to the  underground Martian city, the picture goes downhill too. The ending seems  tacked on, as if money ran out and they had to stop filming where they  were.
Still, the picture has some very good moments, and is enjoyable  50's sci-fi. It is much better than another picture that uses special  effects clips from this movie, the notoriously bad (but fun!)""Queen of  Outer Space"".
""Flight to Mars"" is a curious mixture of the  best of 50's rocketship sci-fi, and the worst of 50's gender stereotyping.
The movie is a wonderful diversion on a Saturday afternoon, and is  probably not as well known as other Saturday sci-fiers. As such, it may be  an undiscovered gem for those who love old sci-fi.
It would also be a  good candidate for your own MST3k party!",952214400,13,2119,4.849162011173185

862971,4,6304402074,"I have been a fan of science fiction movies and books since I was a small boy.  In fact, when this movie was at the theaters I was only about 10 years old.  It really made an impression on me at the time so when I saw this old movie was now on DVD I immediately bought it.  This movie (Flight to Mars) came out in 1951 and was the first science fiction movie made in color at the time.  It starred Cameron Mitchell, Marguerite Chapman, Virginia Huston, and Morris Ankrum.  The special effects are laughable but you have to keep in mind that this movie was made about 63 years ago.

The story centers on a group of four men and one woman flying the first space ship to Mars. They crashed their rocket ship on Mars and began exploring it. They are met by advanced beings that appear to be friendly but have devious plans of taking over Earth. The strange thing is that even though these beings have an advanced scientific civilization, they never mastered how to design and create space ships?  They volunteer to help the Earth people to rebuild their space ship but secretly plan to take the ship over when it is completed.  There are also some romantic interests shown in this film.

If you are an old space movie fan you should check out this film.

862978,4,6304402074,"This is a great science fiction film, but as other reviewers have pointed out the transfer from Image Entertainment is poor with scenes missing, jumpy scenes, missed dialogue, and constant burn holes in the screen. Which is all too bad as the story itself is a very good one. Early classic science fiction interplanetary adventure, complete with woman scientist both on the ship and another Martian woman scientist. The costumes and some of the sets remind me of the Flash Gordon serials, and I think they also took scenes and story from the silent Russian film Aelita--including the name of the Martian female scientist (Aelita). The film ends much too abruptly, rather anti-climatic. If it had been a little longer and slightly more developed characters it would have been even greater. For the sake of cheapness, they had the Martians look and behave exactly like humans, no attempt to make them more alien. Yet I really liked this film. I wish there had been a sequel.

They, either blatantly or subliminally, reflect the cold-war era that was a way of life in the 1950's.

-There is certainly a brown blob in the center of the screen for most of the first half of the movie.

863190,5,6304402074,"Flight to Mars is one of those films where you have to be ""in"" to that kind of movie to like it.  I'm a connoisseur of this genre of films.  Late 1940's to the early 1950's was an era that will never happen again.  Mankind's dream of reaching the stars was getting closer to reaching it's fulfillment in just another decade, but there were still many unknowns.  And that's the charm of these films from that time.  Was the Moon inhabited?  Maybe Mars?  Some scientist's from that time said more than likely not, but there was still that hope that they were.
  Instead of being a true science-based film, it's more like a silly soap opera in space, where the 'astronauts' don't wear any kind of space suit, just WW2 RAF sheepskin flight jackets and pants, topped off with a leather pilot's helmet and high altitude oxygen masks.  What's really amazing is when enroute to mars, nobody floats in the rocket's cabin, and one guy smokes a pipe, and another smokes cigarettes while on their journey!  Space food consists of donuts and coffee in styrofoam cups!  Cheesy, but it is a fun movie.  Would've been suitable for Mystery Science Theater 3000.

The science was actually pretty good for the early 50's; this is not saying much, but at no point did I feel insulted. (We watched this right after Cat Women of the Moon, where the science was pathetic and the acting was worse.)

The Man from Planet X, Thing From Another World, When Worlds Collide, Day the Earth Stood Still and Superman and the Mole Men.  When Worlds Collide would take the Oscar for best photographic effects.  Superman and the Mole Men would lead to TV's Adventures of Superman.

FLIGHT TO MARS premi&egrave;red November 11.  It was in color which was rare treat for aficionados of this genre.

The US Air Force secretly builds a rocket ship without the knowledge of Congress or the American people.  The name of the rocket ship is MARS.  Its intended destination is the mysterious and alluring planet Mars.  For you see, it is under the surface of Mars that its alluring nature will be revealed.

Consisting of a scientific crew of three men and one woman, Steve Abbott, a newspaper reporter, a former war correspondent, is added to the mix.  He falls for Carol, the beautiful assistant to Jim Barker.  Unfortunately, Carol is madly in love with her boss and mentor, Jim.  Jim does not have any romantic interest in Carol, but Steve and Carol hatch a plot to make Jim jealous.  Kissing below decks on a speeding rocket is as romantic as it gets in space.  Of course, Steve does not mind this new assignment in helping Carol.

As fate would have it in the human cosmological history of things, their rocket crashes on Mars.  Unfortunately, their atomic power heads are destroyed which makes a return to earth impossible.  Fortunately, for them there is an entrance to a subterranean city within walking distance.  With their B52 bomber gear and oxygen masks-sorry no space suits for these humans- they head for the entrance and are greeted by space suited Martians-funny, the Martians look like your typical humans next door except the women dress in skimpy miniskirts.  The men dressed in old European fashion with the cape ever flowing.

The Council Members led by President Ikron welcomes the visitors and offer them logging, food and new clothes.  When on Mars, do as the Martians do.

Unfortunately, even with the skimpy dress, Carol cannot divert the attention of Jim.  He is too absorbed in his work of repairing the rocket for the return to earth.  One begins to wonder if the man had any interest in the opposite sex.  Of course, this is 1951 and true to form walks in Alita, a lovely Martian scientist who is there to help Jim anyway that she can.  Jim is smitten, true love at first glance-the first interplanetary romance.  Poor Carol, she is heartbroken and cries for one hour and seventeen minutes on her cot as Steve plays solitaire at the desk and attempts to offer her words of consolation.

President Ikron isn't as saccharine as he appears.  He is malevolent in an altruistic sort of way. He wants to steal the secret of rocket making, build a fleet and attack earth.  For you see Mars is dying.  They need a new home-that's right, they want Earth.

Of course, Tillamar, a member of the Council and Alita's father are opposed to Ikron's genocidal plan for earth.  They decide to help the earth people.

A good old fashioned fist fight ensues.  No ray guns are ever seen.  Guess they could not find the ones from the old Flash Gordon films. Of course, all is well in the end.

The plot is descent.  The special effects are ok.  The characters are well written.  The acting is not so bad.

Overall, it is a descent film from 1951. For its age, picture quality is ok.  Is it worth 71 minutes of your time?  Only if you are a devotee to the genre or just want something to do.

Do I regret purchasing this DVD?  Not for a moment!  It was worth the price.  It is a nice addition to my collection.",1233964800,3,3711,4.593893129770993
863197,4,6304402074,"Flight To Mars, released in 1951, while clearly a small budget production and now considerably dated, still manages to offer some entertaining moments. At least it did for this reviewer. And for those who have not had an opportunity to visit the film, please allow me to point in the general direction of some of them.

Marguerite Chapman and Cameron Mitchell are cast as the star actors in this film, yet I found Virginia Huston to be the most exciting personality present. She plays the part of the solitary female on the rocket propelled flight to Mars and becomes very attractive to the newspaper writer played by Cameron Mitchell. She, however, is amorously attracted to one of the top scientists on the journey, Dr. Jim Barker, played by Arthur Franz. Cameron Mitchell, though, quickly deciphers the clues dropped along the way and draws his own conclusions. Aboard the rocket in flight and with the close proximity imposed upon all, he begins to lay his cards on the table. He has a penchant for Solitaire, but before resigning himself to the waiting game finds himself alone for a few moments with Virginia Huston in a secluded chamber of the ship. The first stolen kiss, and especially the second, must have fallen upon the eyes of many a 1951 viewer with robust reward and lascivious delight. It is here that Virginia Huston demonstrates to me of what material she is made and I was not disappointed. Trim, very pretty, and decidedly feminine, she looked Cameron Mitchell in the eye and hid little from him. When she closed her eyes at the moment of the second kiss, we were vouchsafed a glimpse of her special nature. Lovely.

The crash landing on Mars, a scene in which the rocket ship hits the side of a mountain at an alarming velocity, should have been the last of our cast of intrepid travelers. Remarkably, the craft did not explode, nor were its occupants splattered all over the inside shell of the control cabin. No, with oxygen masks and suits that looked as though they were ripped from a mothballed B-17 Flying Fortress, they departed the crippled ship no worse for wear and trooped out to explore a group of ""chimneys"" that suggested the presence of intelligent life. Things move pretty quickly from this point. Possibly the milk money was running out. Amazing what you can do with a few extremely short skirts and a little imagination, however. My eyes found much to maintain their participation as avid spectators even if the dialogue began to dribble and droop droningly.

If this movie were based on a true story, then it might be concluded Martian fashion did make a statement and found its way to Earth during the 1960's, a little over a decade later. Could it be that Ikron, President of the Ruling Council of Mars, made his way here too? It would certainly explain a number of things about the current political climate on our planet and suggest his place of employment and present occupation.

As others have mentioned, the transfer of the film to DVD reveals a few problems. While much of the DVD imagery is good, there are a few places where brief sequences get skipped. There is a stutter. Some small distortions also appear in some sequences. I noticed none of these things watching the version on VHS tape that is also in my possession.",1222905600,,3274,4.718531468531468
863198,3,6304402074,"Futuristic spaceflight was so much easier back in 1951.  No clumsy spacesuits and none of that weightlessness rigmarole.  You just pull up in front of the rocket and climb on board in whatever you happen to be wearing at the time, lay down and put your belt on, and before you know it, you're in space.  Sure, there's a short period of weightlessness, but that wasn't in the budget, so you don't have to worry about it.  Look out for meteor storms, but it's not like they're going to sneak up on you because they make so much darn noise in space.  Crash landing?  No problem - that's what those leather helmets are for.  You don't even have to worry about the atmosphere, temperature, etc., of the planet you crash on - just run out the door and have at it.  Best of all, you don't have to leave your pipe and tobacco at home, as it's perfectly safe to smoke onboard the spaceship.

Actually, the most difficult part of this Flight to Mars is putting up with Carol Stafford (Virginia Huston), the ""indispensable"" assistant to flight engineer Jim Barker (Arthur Franz), who shows her desperate love for Jim by being the witchiest (or something like that) woman in the Solar System.  I wouldn't want to spend a few weeks stuck in a big can with journalist Steve Abbott (Cameron Mitchell), either, especially when he starts wooing the ice woman.  Thank goodness for the two old male scientists who round out the crew of five; they are likable enough when they aren't waxing philosophical or talking about how they don't expect any of them to survive the mission.  By the way, if you think the interior of the spaceship looks familiar, it's basically the same one used in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocketship-X-M/dp/6305869367/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocketship X-M</a>&nbsp;a year earlier.

Well, they do make it to Mars, where they are greeted by friendly Martians (clad, unlike their visitors from Earth, in actual spacesuits, the same ones used in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destination-Moon/dp/6305761078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destination Moon</a>) who promise to help them in any way they can to repair their ship and return to Earth.  If anything, the Martians are a little bit too supportive.  Oddly enough, despite all of their technological advances, they can't generate a signal powerful enough to reach Earth - nor have they gotten anywhere with their own rocket program (maybe their scientists are too distracted by the skimpy dresses the young women walk around in).  Will Earth's brave space crewmen (you can't call them astronauts) ever return to Earth?  Will they sneak off and leave Carol on Mars (I certainly would)?  Will Earthlings and Martians be friends or enemies?  These are just some of the questions you might ask as this film works its way to the end.  You probably won't care very much, but you might ask the questions, anyway.

I can't comment on the picture quality of the DVD, but I do know that the print I saw was pretty grainy - so much so that I couldn't read a word of an urgent teletype message posted onscreen early in the movie.  I was impressed that the film was shot in color, though - this is a 1951 film we're talking about here (they were still making plenty of black and white science fiction films as late as the early 1960s).  It's worth noting that the model spaceship shots created for this movie were good enough to be recycled in such later films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-of-Outer-Space/dp/B000OHZJNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen of Outer Space</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-Without-End/dp/0790731215/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World Without End</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-The-Terror-from-Beyond-Space/dp/B00005K3O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It! The Terror from Beyond Space</a>.  Story-wise, though, the film is OK at best.  The first half of the film (including the space flight itself) is pretty boring, and the mini-soap opera subplots didn't do much for me, either.  Things get more interesting on Mars, but not interesting enough for me to give this film more than three stars.  Despite everything I've said, though, I did actually enjoy Flight to Mars - and so will you if you share my love for campy old science fiction classics.",1221868800,,4473,5.510980966325037
863199,3,6304402074,"Fans of B&W SciFi will enjoy watching the film at least once in a while. A bit too talkie and character based for a film of this quality, it could use more action or special effects time.",1220659200,,187,4.081081081081081

After the space travelers land, some leaders of the Martian people see an opportunity to seize the spaceship as a prototype and build a fleet of ships to invade Earth.

""Flight to Mars"" is a superior sci fi movie about an advanced civilization on resource-depleted Mars trying to save its dying race, but poorly prepared on DVD. Several strange dropouts of dialog. Color quality of the DVD provides deeper and better colors over the videotape version, but many scratches.

  now if 50's space cheese is your thing this silly but fun trip to mars is just what you want. set in the year 2000(but still very 50's)this flight finds life and air on mars. the life forms are human and of corse they want to invade earth. you don't find cheese much better than this. sit back and enjoy!!!",1151280000,,424,4.146341463414634
863252,3,6304402074,"Flight to Mars gets off to a decent start, by 50's sci-fi movie standards, as a group of guys and the token gal set off for an ambitious exploration of the Red Planet.  But once they arrive, they are greeted by very human Martians (wearing space helmets...can they not breathe their OWN air??).  While the Martians offer to help the earthlings repair their rocketship, they are actually plotting to use the ship to launch an attack on Earth.

If you're looking for low-budget but still effective interstellar thrills, you probably won't find much here (see Invaders From Mars, Forbidden Planet, etc.).  Admittedly, not much was known about real space travel in 1951, but much of the dialogue hopelessly dates Flight to Mars (Favorite bit: The Earth gal, upon seeing how the Martians live, asks a Martian female to take her to the kitchen).  Yes, there is a certain appeal to the Martian women's costumes, some of which are so short I'm surprised they got past the censors.  And there are a couple of mildly impressive sets.  But really, the overall story moves at a snail's pace and the acting is mostly just tolerable.

As someone has already stated, the print quality here leaves a bit to be desired.  Some scratches and color changes are to be expected from a film that's over 50 years old, but there are also numerous missing frames that usually result a in jarring break in the dialogue.  Most annoying is a red spot just off-center of the picture which appears to be a spot burned into the print itself.

If you're fan of these type of films, you'll probably want this in your collection, despite its many flaws.",1124496000,3,1618,4.681978798586573

863255,3,6304402074,"This is yet another great SciFi classic that I first saw as a kid way back in the mid 20th century. I've seen it since on TV and VHS and I was very excited when I heard it was to be realeased on DVD. That excitement was soon dampened when I viewed this DVD. The original image used for transfer is absolutely horrible. There is fading, graining, and many splices that make the film jump and in some spots causes choppy dialog - and those are the minor faults. Almost immediatly after the film begins there appears a very distracting brown smuge directly in the middle of the screen. A very anoying blemish that changes shape and contorts for nearly a third of the movie.
Unfortunately, this is the only DVD copy of this film available so I whole-heartedly recommend it as a buy for collectors.

No matter, a movie about a trip to Mars which is inhabited by beautiful women and coniving men cant be all bad. And watch out for those meteors.",1039392000,59,529,4.145631067961165
863257,4,6304402074,"Fans of cheesy 1950s space operas will no doubt be pleased that this is out on DVD, although unfortunately the quality of the source print leaves a bit to be desired. Flight to Mars was rushed out by Monogram to capitalize on the success of Destination Moon, and really has no grounding in serious science fiction. Not yet famous and powerful, producer Walter Mirisch (Magnificent Seven, In the Heat of the Night) was still making Bomba the Jungle Boy movies, scripter Arthur Strawn had penned Karloff's The Black Room and a handful of potboilers, while director Lesley Selander (Vampire's Ghost, Catman of Paris) and associate producer/editor Richard Heermance cranked out mostly lotsa cheap westerns before and after Flight to Mars, everyone's sole SF credit. Genre fans will appreciate the presence of Cameron Mitchell (Gorilla at Large, Nightmare in Wax) as glib ""newspaperman"" Steve Abbott, Arthur Franz (Invaders from Mars, Monster on the Campus, Atomic Submarine) as bland, pipe-smoking Dr. Barker, and John Litel (perhaps most recognizable as Henry Aldrich's perpetually exasperated father) as Dr. Lane. Ubiquitous genre icon Morris Ankrum gets probably his meatiest SF role as Martian leader Ikron (he looks quite ludicrous in his `Captain Marvel' costume and cape), while Virginia Huston and Marguerite Chapman fill out the parts of brainy lady scientist (pining for the oblivious Dr. Barker) and brainy Martian babe Alita, respectively.

Apparently they could only afford one set of space suits (for the Martians) so everyone just wears bomber jackets and aviator's caps on the takeoff and spaceflight. All the requisite elements of cheap 50s space epics are here: the threatening (animated) meteor shower; patronizing, sexist dialogue; technical inaccuracies (e.g. the Martian surface is covered with snow; no zero-G effect in-flight); quaintly obvious miniatures and model work; pseudophilosophical discussions that go nowhere; and of course the whirlwind love quadrangle of Mitchell, Huston, Franz, and Chapman. Somehow they survive a point-blank crash into a Martian mountain without injury (!), and of course [spoiler alert] the ""friendly"" Martians are really plotting against Earth and plan to use the repaired ship to attack us. Mitchell makes his play for Huston as Franz and Chapman get hot and heavy, the Earth people forge a secret plan (with Alita) to escape, and all is saved in a rather hasty and abrupt conclusion. While Flight to Mars gets a little talky at times (it's really not a hysterical knee-slapper on the order of Queen of Outer Space or Missile to the Moon) it will nonetheless appeal to any fan of campy low-budget space flicks such as Cat-Women of the Moon, Rocketship X-M, Project Moon Base (highly, highly recommended!!), Fire Maidens of Outer Space, etc. Serious SF aficionados beware.

This is another in Image's Wade Williams Collection and while probably the best print to be had suffers in comparison to most of its peers. There is light to medium speckling, spotting, and sporadic lining throughout (noticeably heavier around a couple of reel changes), although some stretches of the film are reasonably clean. There is also a very small but noticeable flickering emulsion `ding' at the lower center of the frame that comes and goes through nearly the entire movie. More annoying are a half-dozen or so jump-cuts scattered throughout the film; a couple show up at reel changes, and several are clustered in a climactic dialogue scene. Ouch! Purists who whined about the quality of Image's Destination Moon DVD will be similarly distressed by this release. That said, the brightness, contrast, and detail are fine; resolution is not razor-sharp but quite acceptable; and the bargain-basement Cinecolor looks as good as it probably ever did: heavy on the blue-greens and oranges in the palette, but well saturated, with reasonably accurate fleshtones. Not a stellar print, but a crisp, clean transfer; no doubt an improvement over any VHS version, and probably the best we'll see for the forseeable future. (Apparently Warner Bros. owns the old Monogram and Allied Artists catalogs and is sitting tight on them. And who knows if they even have a better print at this point?)

The disc also includes two approximately 25-minute episodes of an early-80s Santa Monica, CA cable TV show, hosted by Scarlet Street contributor David Del Valle, with guest Cameron Mitchell. The interview is light in tone but informative and wide-ranging, covering Flight to Mars, Gorilla at Large, Death of a Salesman, Nightmare in Wax, the six (!) films Mitchell made for Mario Bava, and numerous other topics. The only downside is that the video quality on these segments is poor, like a mid-grade videotape (apparently the hi-def masters were lost). Still a nice extra, especially for Cameron Mitchell fans. A very-good-to-excellent-quality, lightly speckled trailer (with the same fluttering emulsion ding!) for Flight to Mars and five `bonus' trailers for other Wade Williams titles are included. The photo gallery promised on the box was nowhere to be found on my copy. With the flaws in the feature source print, the unfortunately mediocre picture quality of the interview segments, and missing photo gallery, objectively would I have to give the disc three stars, but this is still an essential (four-star) buy for fans of low-budget 1950s SF or Cameron Mitchell.",1022976000,72,5393,5.246813441483198

Usually the Sci-Fi genre is just a vehicle to bring social and emotional conflicts out in a palatable format.

We see the need for a slide rule to be sure we are on course and they do not need space suits. The spacesuit thing comes full circle until we have the movie ""GATTACA"" (1997) in which once again we no longer need fancy space suits.
