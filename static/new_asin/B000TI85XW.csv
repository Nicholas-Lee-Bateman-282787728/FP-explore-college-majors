It is a shame, many people worked long and hard on this film and they'll be tared with having been involved with a fraud.

8509388,1,B000TI85XW,"The ""filmmaker,"" and I use that term very loosely, stole the idea for the movie, so why give them any of your hard earned cash?

Looks like they got caught, though.  Official site is down, and its no longer carried by the distributer.

Guess she got what was coming to her.  And i meant for the stealing, not the 2nd year film school quality of this excuse for a film.",1192665600,5,368,4.214285714285714
8509389,5,B000TI85XW,This movie is great!  Intense with lots of twists.  Awesome imagery and very artistic.  I highly recommend this movie!!!!,1192406400,,121,5.2631578947368425
8509390,1,B000TI85XW,"""Fractured"" is not only a poorly executed film, it's poorly executed theft of a brilliant book, Will Christopher Baer's ""Kiss Me, Judas"" which pre-dates this film by almost ten years. Forget about the urban legend. 95% of the dialogue in Klosowski's film is taken verbatim from Baer's novel, as well as the storyline and order of scenes. This is a blatant case of theft. Yet in spite of stealing some brilliant source material, she managed to screw it up.

Don't support this thieving hack. Read ""Kiss Me, Judas"" instead.",1191628800,5,521,4.853932584269663
8509391,1,B000TI85XW,"This movie is actually a rip off of a novel written by Will Christopher Baer.  Jut from the trailer, I could see plenty of imagery stolen directly from the book.  Not vague similarities, but very specific details.
Kiss Me, Judas is a beautiful novel.  This movie looks to be a pathetic forgery.
I look forward to hearing about some legal action.",1191110400,4,345,4.622950819672131
