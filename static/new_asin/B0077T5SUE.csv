5062888,2,B0077T5SUE,"First off let me say that im a die hard, i have owned everything  that the g1 transformers have released from beta to bluray! That said I am extremely  disappointed with this and the headmasters dvds, I know this is a japan product but how hard would  it have been to include the half decent english audio that has been on every cheap bootleg released?? I can not enjoy the animation trying to read, not to mention that the japenease music just ruins the vibe of the show competelly. Its a shame shout took a cheap way out! Save your money on this, go to ebay and buy all 3 imported transformers series for less then 40 bucks with ENGLISH!!!",1345075200,5,641,4.325
5062889,5,B0077T5SUE,I was very disappointed with the Transformers : Japanese Collection Headmasters DVD!  I felt the Shout Factory cheated the fans by editing footage that existed in Transformers : Headmasters anime series.  I am so glad this is not the problem with Transformers : Japanese Collection SuperGod Masterforce!  The DVD looks like it has all the footage from the original broadcast in Japan.  I am pleased that all the scenes and the animations of the Transformers Pretenders and PowerMasters are intact. I am very happy with the second release and I hope they do the same thing with Transformers : Japanese Collection Victory!  This is a great DVD set but know that you have to get use to the Japanese audio and English subtitles.  God Ginrai looks like PowerMaster Optimus Prime (Convoy)  but he isn't Optimus Prime (Convoy). He is a different Transformer!  I love this DVD! This is a must have for all Transformers anime series fans!  A+++++++,1341705600,13,939,4.8924050632911396
5062890,5,B0077T5SUE,I always wanted to know what happened after the transformers went off the air in the U.S. back in the late 80's. I wish it was dubbed in english tho,1339718400,5,148,3.966666666666667
5062891,5,B0077T5SUE,if you love transformers you will love this one. the only draw back is that it is only in japanese which after the first episode you get used to it and it dosent bother you,1339632000,2,172,3.942857142857143
5062892,5,B0077T5SUE,"Great addition for Transformers fans who want to know which way Japan went after replacing ""The Rebirth"" for their own Headmaster series.  Masterforce is the second installment to the Japanese collection, and it was good Shout factory waited a year to release it...They left everything in tact, including the ""bumps"".  Quality of this set is better as well.  Very Satisfied, and can't wait for Victory.",1339200000,10,402,5.153846153846154

5062894,5,B0077T5SUE,"I have waiting for a very long time for this release.  But is it really only in English?  Shout would have done a better job making this release in English and Japanese.

5062906,3,B0077T5SUE,"I bought it just to collect it, this series It's not the best series you would like to watch, I understand that this was a continuation of the series made for a Japanese audience back in the days.

5062927,5,B0077T5SUE,"A must own for any true transformer fan / collector. Been a fan since the original airing as a kid. I immediate purchased this from Amazon as soon as it went on sale. I've been wanting to find a high quility version of these series and it delivers. Only wish is that it would have been dubbed. Stub titles are ok, but I think it would be more enjoyable in English. Nonetheless, a great story arc with cool new characters.",1418428800,2,421,4.275

5062929,2,B0077T5SUE,"I shocked at the blurry video and unclear audio in Super-God Masterforce. Headmasters had a decent transfer and the video and audio looked acceptable and was clear. Super-God Masterforce looks like it was ripped from a VHS, with blurry video and muddy audio. I have to turn my volume up quite a bit to make out what the dialogue.",1393027200,,329,4.593220338983051
5062930,5,B0077T5SUE,"Following after the finale of the Headmasters series comes this new entry & also the second part of the Japanese trilogy. Super God Masterforce again re-imagines the Transformers mythos from the original Generation 1 series & just like Headmasters, there's a slew of new characters & story lines from this almost alternate universe if you will. While this Japanese series is an extension of the original cartoon it's also something that stands very much on it's own making it quite accessible to viewers not familiar with the massive space opera  that is Transformers. This second part of the Japanese trilogy centers on humans who actually connect with & wield the Transformer armor which is quite different from it's generation 1 predecessor but concepts that were introduced in  The Headmasters series. This series obviously has a very different flavor from the American show but not so different that you won't enjoy the action & deep space, cosmic conflicts. Overall, you really gotta love this stuff & this entire collection is in it's original Japanese language with English subtitles & not that it matters but for many it may be annoying & may even be a real test in endurance to sit & watch each episode if you get tired to constantly read captions. But besides that, excellent transfer & menus, & this massive five disc collection features every single episode of this eagerly anticipated fan favorite import.",1383955200,4,1419,5.008474576271187

5062932,5,B0077T5SUE,Amazon once again delivers. Nothing to bring back childhood memories. I will recommend this to anyone who loves a classic cartoon.,1378425600,,130,5.238095238095238
5062933,5,B0077T5SUE,"I bought this box set after ,I remember watching an old bootleg dvd. That I had years ago but the bootleg had only 3 episodes on it. So when I found out that Amazon, had the full series. On dvd I had to get this and eventually, I'll get Headmasters and Victory too. I also hope that Shout Factory , will release Beast Wars Second and Beast Wars Neo. On dvd here in America , this after I found out that they released both in Japan. Last year so it's inevitable that the powers that be, will release it over here. So cross your fingers folks!!!",1371600000,,543,4.132075471698113

5062946,5,B0077T5SUE,I love Transformers since the show first aired in 1984. The Transformers Super-God Masterforce series is awsome. I have on video tape or DVD every episode ever broadcast in the USA. I wish this would have had a US broadcast.,1365897600,,224,4.625
5062947,5,B0077T5SUE,a great flow up to head masters -great characters -the humans becoming transformers alone is also well done -as they are not 2 integrated beings just one it makes a lot more sense than the english mini series -also lots of fights and interesting plots a must have for collectors and fans alike,1359072000,,293,4.547169811320755

5062952,5,B0077T5SUE,"Out of all the Transformers Japanese series, Masterforce is the one I am waiting for the most on DVD and it was worth it upon viewing it. While it doesn't contain much special features such as an art gallery, the episodes themselves are crisp and in its highest-quality as it should be. It features the Powermasters, Headmaster Juniors, Pretender Shells, and the Seacons. I've always felt that if the original Transformers series continued, it would have likely lead to the Powermasters, especially Powermaster Optimus Prime aka God Ginrai. It comes with a slipcase cover and 5 discs. There are no English dubs, but only Japanese language with English subtitles. This is a high recommender for a true Transformer fan.",1353283200,,717,5.033613445378151
5062953,5,B0077T5SUE,"I am a major fan of the original Transformers, Generation one, and being that the Japanese collection continues their story, it has been an amazing addition to see. If you love Transformers, any genre, these are a must see, and the subtitles are not a problem. Great Characters, lots of epic Autobot vs Decepticon battles, and a great number of surprises along the way. It's a blast to see these for the first time, but I already know they're going to be just as great when I watch them again, and I will. They may have been made overseas, in Japan, but they're true to the heart of the Transformers story line. I highly recommend them to any anime lover, and especially to every Transformers Fan.",1351123200,,697,4.5396825396825395
5062954,5,B0077T5SUE,"Super God Masterforce is one of the more unique entries in the Transformers Universe, I say this because it focuses more on the Human race learning to defend their world themselves through the use of Transtectors rather then the Transformers themselves. It's a very interesting concept and allows you to connect more with the characters.
The style of Masterforce is much more Anime in influence then Takara's previous series Headmasters. Which is departing further from the American influence of the original Generation One series. This doesn't hurt the show at all. In fact from an Animation stand point everything feels a lot more dynamic, a lot of the Transformations are done with Stock footage which allows for more impressive animation and makes the characters seem more powerful.
Story wise, as I mentioned above Masterforce is very different then the previous series, Innitially the main cast of Cybertrons (Autobots) and Destrons (Decepticons) consist of Pretenders. Transformers who hide in an outer shell that helps them blend in with organic life on Earth. Eventually the Pretenders are phased to minor characters as the main cast of Humans who become God Masters (Power masters) and Head Masters repectively take center stage. They merge with Transtectors (lifeless Transformer bodies) to become a new form of life.

As far as the set goes, it's well put togethor the menu system is the same as Headmasters except the Masterforce theme plays in the background. I experienced a problem on Disc 4 where the subtitles got stuck during an episode for a few minutes. It was during a fight scene so most of the dialog was the usual ""I'll kill you"" ""No you won't"" stuff. Other then that the set is definately worth the $20 I paid for it.
If you don't mind reading subtitles, and you can't get enough old school Transformers then this is a great set at a great value. Shout Factory has put togethor a chance for fans to own nice high quality versions of previously (Legaly) unobtainable material. There is no Dub track on these DVD's it is Japanese only. This may deter some people, but I urge you for twenty bucks give it a chance.
In reguards to a previous reviewers comments it would have been VERY expensive to do a dub of this series for this release which would have increased the price of the set. Any fan who wants to see it in English can certainly purchase bootlegs of the very poor Star dubs where the same five voice actors play all the characters and everyone is named wrong. But if you want a high quality representation of these great shows for a very affordable price then Shout Factory has provided it.",1346976000,2,2624,4.792494481236203

8512174,5,B0077T5SUE,"Worth adding to any G1 Transformers fan's collection. They are subbed and not dubbed, but that's hardly an issue to me.",1487808000,,119,4.714285714285714
8512175,4,B0077T5SUE,"I bought this along with the other DVD sets in the Japanese collection, Headmasters and Victory. I wanted to see how the story of the Transformers proceeded after the end of Season 3 of the American version and Headmasters takes up that mantle. Super-God Masterforce goes further with it thereafter and completely changes the game on what we know about the Transformers. There are a lot of new concepts and ideas and they're all kind of shoveled in all at once then kind of stewed together in a pot, then the story archs start to take shape. Here is what I thought and some observations.

1. This one takes place some time later after the end of Headmasters. Apparently there were Transformers, calling themselves Pretenders, that came to earth during the Stone Age and since there were not vehicles or even metal creations (ahem, the Stone Age), they used their advanced technology that manipulates an energy called Masterforce to transform into human forms for the Autobots, and the Decepticons transformed into beasts to scare the cave people. Autobots fend them off and in a big battle freeze them and suspend them in a sleep like state for millions of years until they are awakened by an alien force called Devil Z who takes control of the Decepticons (names in this series are not overly clever).  The Autobots who look like functional human beings call out ""Masterforce"" or ""Pretender"" to transform into their natural states.

2. A couple of children, then later a third are recruited to become Headmaster Juniors, basically they wear bracelets that employ the Masterforce to put a metal body around them and then they transform to a head that attaches to a Transformer body, called a Transcepter, which they operate. It is much like the same concept as the Headmasters, but for humans. It's obvious the Japanese wanted to use children since that was their target base and they wanted little children to get into the characters more and empathize. Three children are employed for the Autobots, three for the Decepticons. We learn later that the transtectors were sent by Chromedome from planet Master and that is really the only tie to the previous Headmasters series that we get. Maybe an occasional mention here or there but not much more.

3. Then they introduce the GodMasters. These are a blend of human conscious and Transformer body that have evolved together and become a greater entity that is more super evolved and stronger than regular Transformers, bordering on God like status hence GodMasters.  Two Decepticon Godmasters (one of which looks like a elite version of Cobra Commander from GI Joe, no joke) show up to join the Decepticons on Earth and quickly make fun of them for not being as evolved and as strong as them but most episodes end the same way with them failing to kill off or exact their plan the way they want. Then the Autobots come to realize that there are 5 pairs of rings that will create Godmasters for the chosen humans that are worthy. The Decepticons and Autobots race off to see if they can get to the rings first before the other gets to them.

4. That leads to the rings being found by humans who don't know what the rings are for and they end up becoming Godmasters themselves. The bracelets use a different kind of energy called Godforce and that is what transforms them to Godmasters. Godforce is what creates their bodies that they can willing go from human to Godmaster Transformer and back.

5. From there, we find that four of the Godmasters become Autobots, the last one becomes a Decepticon. A man, a truck driver, name GinRai becomes the leader of the Autobots after the Pretenders (who are older, more wise, and millions of years older than the humans) decide because he is the most powerful and takes the form of a truck that looks just like Optimus Prime. GinRai then learns how to be a leader and get used to his power all at the same time while fighting.

6. After a while, a mention of the Decepticon Emperor is made that sent Black Zarak to help seal the deal and take care of the Earth.

7. Everything is thwarted in true Transformer style and in the most bizarre part I found, the Transformer side splits from the human side and the Transformers leave the earth to pursue the Decepticons yet my biggest beef with that was that the Pretenders were Transformers that were just pretending to be human, not humans that were transforming into robot beings like the Headmaster Juniors. Why the robot side split from the human side in that made zero sense but it is what it is.

Once you get all of that new stuff out of the way, you get a bunch of rehashed stuff. It's like they ran out of ideas for Transformers so they decided to just reimagine old toy lines and slap new names on them. For example, Fortress Maxiumus from Headmasters returns as Grand Maximus. Same shape and size of Fortress, but different coloring and apparently the brother of Fortress. Black Zarak is introduced and all he is is a prettier version of Scorponok from Headmasters. Sixknight is just a six-changer remake of Sixshot from Headmasters, but is a ninja like warrior with no affiliation that has never been defeated that looks to join the Decepticons until he is defeated by the leader of the Autobots then out of respect continues to help them over time. As I said before, Optimus Prime's body is just a Godmaster form for the human, GinRai, that becomes the eventual leader of the Autobots.

The main problem with the series is that they introduce these new Transformers that have loads of backstory and history and they never explore it. Before they even get close, they move on to the next. Pretenders goes to Headmaster Juniors goes to Godmasters goes to determining the leader of the Autobots goes to Mega and Giga (tripler changer leaders of the Decepticons just below Devil-Z) goes to BlackZarak/Grand Maximus. They never spend any time really allowing you to dig into what a Pretender truly is or what a Headmaster Junior can truly evolve to before they are pushed to the side for the Godmasters and the rest of the story arch. After the main story arch continues past the introductions, the Pretenders and Headmaster Juniors really become secondary characters and side notes more than deeply enthralled characters. What a waste.

All of that said, it takes itself seriously and proceeds with a sense of urgency but doesn't get too goofy or too kiddish to make an adult or teen lose interest. Because of that, I found it better than Headmasters. Animation is better, music is about the same. For some reason they have to say ""Transform"" or ""God-On"" (for the Godmasters) or ""Pretender"" or Multi-On (for the combiners) each time they actually do, same as in Headmasters but in much more quantity. All in all I liked it far more than Headmasters and think you will all enjoy as well if you're huge on Transformers.",1486166400,,6861,4.708333333333333

8512177,3,B0077T5SUE,"After a strong Headmasters series the Transformers take a dive. You'll notice immediately when the theme song starts in comparison to the Headmasters theme.

This is probably my least favorite Transformers series. The Pretenders are the worst and most confusing mess in the franchise with Headmaster Jrs coming right behind them. I always said the worst part of the transformers was the Human element and this is full of all that. It does pick up a little towards the end but I watched the entire series on my PS3 at 1.5 speed just to burn through them and get to Victory.",1478304000,,572,4.663366336633663

Still, as a rabid Transformers fan who wanted to know EVERYTHING, I gritted my teeth and prepared to endure... and was very surprised to find myself watching a fairly enjoyable anime!
Characters are likeable, the plot is a little loose but it's there, and there have actually been a couple emotional moments that caught me off guard.
Like a said a very enjoyable MECHA ANIME. Because this is where fans of Transformers need to be warned: this is HUMANS pretending to be Transformers, and it SHOWS. I personally never had the illusion the characters transformers into mechanical aliens. For me it looked more like a Transformers influenced Gundamn series. But, again, a very enjoyable one, and I personally don't regret watching it.",1456876800,,874,4.912162162162162
