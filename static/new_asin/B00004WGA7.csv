7925248,5,B00004WGA7,"Two hilarious kung fu ""classics"" from the golden age of drive-in theater kung fu movies. If you take this genre seriously and shudder at the thought of watching a movie dubbed into english, you will not like these. If you want to laugh and be entertained, and occasionally wonder ""what just happened there?"" you're going to love these movies!

The quality is about what you expect, pan and scan, slightly fuzzy image, poor sound.... in other words perfect for re-enacting the way most everyone from the western world first saw these classics!",1430870400,,542,4.891304347826087

7925250,1,B00004WGA7,Very little in this movie related to Bruce Lee. The quality of both movies on this dvd is subpar. I am glad I did not pay a lot for this product.,1364256000,,145,3.7096774193548385
7925251,1,B00004WGA7,"This is a documentary about Bruce Lee, not the movie I was expecting, poor picture quality. Also not the real Bruce Lee in fights back from the Grave.",1351209600,,150,4.392857142857143
7925252,5,B00004WGA7,"A helpful insight movie to get us to understand him more

his life more

his movies more

him in general

and just enjoy it

sure he wasn't in it

but it's still great

i'll always have this dvd to watch if I ever want to remember something memorable about him. like his role in Green Hornet which I will get on dvd someday.",1109376000,,324,4.0476190476190474
7925253,1,B00004WGA7,"Unfortunately you can't give less then one star. Bruce Lee was not in this film. It appears to be an attempt to capitalize on his fame. This is a cheap 70's 'karate movie' about a ficticious 'karate tournament' that pulls old 60's-70's low budget chinese kung foo movies and attempts to pass it off as 'bruce lee's story'. this isn't even good for laughs. too bad they don't have a pic of the cover though. Bruce Lee is written in huge letters along with his picture and uses a name close to one of his more famous movies ""fists of fury"" hoping people will buy it by accident.
Don't make the mistake!  He is not in this movie!",970617600,12,626,4.305084745762712
