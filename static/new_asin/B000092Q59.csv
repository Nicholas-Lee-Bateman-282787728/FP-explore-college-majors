1876974,1,B000092Q59,"The Blair Witch Project meets the Kennedy conspiracy. In a word - boring. Take it for what it is: a low budget movie with an interesting concept but a lame movie nonetheless. The ""surprise"" ending wasn't that great and didn't have me on the edge of my seat.",1135036800,4,257,4.375
1876975,1,B000092Q59,"First, one must decide if this film is fact or fiction.  If supposed fact, there are several glaring errors here.  The film only mentions two shots, which in my humble opinion is worse than the Warren commission.  This negates a lot of evidence which even the Warren Commission found.....and we know they are right....right?  Second, the final scene with the ""Assassin"" bears but slight relation to reality, although the blood spatter on the wall is nice, he doesn't bleed after hitting the ground.

If fiction then the film is very poorly made, even for an ""independant"" film.  A bit more research and effort would have made this film entertaining.

Personally I feel this is an effort to get the last few nuggets of gold from the Kennedy assassination mine.",1121385600,5,759,4.837209302325581
1876976,4,B000092Q59,"Rented this movie blind and loved it. Had no idea what to expect and was happily surprised both by the premise and the execution. The low-key, fly-on-the-wall direction and a sublime turn by Raymond J. Barry propel the viewer along on a paranoic humdinger of a ride. Certainly kept me guessing although I thought the ending could've been handled a little better. The documentary style factoid notes just before the end credits were a nice touch. On the whole a good movie with a fantastic first half and an ok second.",1112572800,12,517,4.6923076923076925
1876977,5,B000092Q59,"Well done, well researched, and well made.

 To the casual viewer one might be lead to believe that this was an actual documentary, that is how well this film was made.

 From beggining to end you find yourself deeply involved in the conspiracy that is unfolding and in this process you learn a few things as well such as names, places, theories, and most importantly, that the cover-up is still going on.

 If you are doing any research on JFK and the events surrounding his mysterious death you will find this film interesting and informative.",1098057600,6,545,4.684210526315789
1876978,3,B000092Q59,"Honestly, I think I'm still a bit confused after seeing this movie.  Reading the ""Extras"" helped a bit but I'm still not sure what to think of it.
Almost forty years after the John F. Kennedy assassination, an ex-Marine named Walter Ohlinger comes forward with a startling claim.  He was the shooter on the grassy knoll.  I'm really into conspiracy theories but this one seemed a bit kooky and hard to believe.  The acting by the ex-marine was superb!  It's not a movie I'd rush out to rent again, but I'm glad I did see it.",1088985600,,524,4.416666666666667
1876979,1,B000092Q59,"If you have a serious interest in the JFK assassination then DO NOT buy this movie.  If you're someone who loved Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" movie and has seen it 20X then DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.  The producer is using the JFK assassination premise to lure you in and aside from the scenes in Dealy Plaza the movie goes nowhere. This is the most BORING film that I've ever seen associated with JFK's murder.  I wouldn't have thought that could be possible.  The movie doesn't even shed any fictitous light on the case and it's very unrealistic.  Go rent or buy Executive Action for a clever, fictional depiction of what might have happened in Dallas forty years ago. I'll repeat, DO NOT get sucked in by the JFK assassination premise.  If you do, like I did, you'll be disappointed two hours later. What a waste of $22.",1069027200,7,811,4.482993197278912
1876980,1,B000092Q59,"I'm shocked by the generally glowing reviews this movie received here. From my perspective this movie is generally disinformation which only confuses people and continues the coverup. For more accurate movies/documentaries and even audio tapes about the JFK assassination are available. Jim Garrison, the District Attorney of New Orleans, who prosecuted Clay Shaw for taking part in the assassination of JFK, made a documentary and has in invaluable book, if it can be found, ""On The Trail of the Assassins: My Investigation and Prosecution of the Murder of President Kennedy"". Garrison also gave a lecture, which I found on tape on the internet, titled ""The Rise of the Fourth Reich"". For those who have seen Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" and recall the character ""X"" please read ""JFK: The CIA, Vietnam and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy"" by L. Fletcher Prouty. Prouty was the real life ""X"" who knows what went down. Do a web search on Prouty and you'll find much more information about the JFK assassination. Look up John Judge and COPA on the internet. Judge has given some very detailed lectures, on video and audio tape, which explain many of the details of the assassination and who Judge believes was involved. One video, ""The Hidden History of the United States"", by Judge, is quite helpful about understanding why JFK was assassinated.",1060560000,5,1344,5.004464285714286
1876981,4,B000092Q59,"This movie, ""Interview with the assassin"", is a very well done independant film.
  It is a story about how a man meets, by sheer coincidence, the Gunman that was on the Grassy Knoll when JFK was killed.
  If you are a JFK assassination researcher, this is a must see movie!
  In fact some scenes in this movie were actually filmed on the Grassy Knoll itself!
  This movie depicts the weirdness that seems to come when the JFK murder is discussed.
  How some people get so obsessed with the case is demonstrated perfectly in this movie also.
  Now, I won't give away the ending. But I will tell you this.......This movie is well worth adding to your collection, even if you're not an avid researcher into the Kennedy murder.
  This DVD has some great special features, such as commentary from the man who created the movie, as well as a VERY interesting
 piece of information about the many people that died mysteriously in connection with the JFK assassination conspiracy.
  I recommend it highly!",1056931200,6,997,4.703488372093023
1876982,5,B000092Q59,"Sure, this movie may be sort of ""cliche"", but it does really open up the mind about what really happened surrounding rhe assassination of JFK. Even if you believe that there was only one shooter, I highly recommend watching this movie and it may open up your eyes a little more.",1055548800,,278,4.470588235294118
1876983,3,B000092Q59,"Seems real but has anyone corroborated the story w/facts i.e. dead man,marine in hospital as having occurred, cop beat up following him w/plate#, etc. The newspaper giving a acknowlegement, even w/some proof of their knowing this.",1424908800,,230,5.416666666666667
1876984,1,B000092Q59,poorly conceived and poorly written. This was a total disappointment.,1422489600,,69,6.0
1876985,2,B000092Q59,"The conspiracy movie that mocks conspiracy theorists, basically portraying them as loons with a persecution complex. Unfair?  Likely.  Do many in that camp deserve to be mocked relentlessly?  Without a doubt.  This movie purports to tell one story, feints in another direction, swerves back in reverse and finally veers into the fever swamp of tin foil hattery.  Too clever in my opinion but I commend them for trying.  Satire is difficult if not impossible, and sometimes risky.  Just ask Sony Pictures.

And no, haha, it's not real.  It's a movie.  It's fiction. Just like every other JFK conspiracy theory that's been dreamed up over the past 50 years designed to profit off the death of a president, while masquerading as some righteous, patriotic defense of liberty or whatever b.s. excuse these people come up with.

Riddle me this:  Was John Hinckley the lone gunmen on that blustery March day in 1981 when he shot Ronald Reagan?  Who cares?  Why?  Because President Reagan lived.  If he had died, there'd be a cottage industry around his assassination too.  What's the link between the Hinckley clan and the Bush family?  Don't want to go down that rabbit hole?  Didn't think so.  Simply put, some screwballs have better aim than others. That's the lesson here.

If you can tolerate shaky ""found footage"" style film making you should be good.  If the style or content of this film is likely to make you vomit, best to skip it.  That's my advice.  Don't really think you're gaining or losing much one way or another.",1419552000,,1523,4.813953488372093

1876987,3,B000092Q59,"As another reviewer, I found this by accident looking for actual history.  This movie is  total fiction, nonsensical as far is history goes, but it IS a pretty decent thriller, despite a low budget.  Some good performances, a half-decent script, and not bad direction. All nonsense, factually, but this movie is a moderately decent thriller.",1403395200,,341,5.163636363636364
1876988,5,B000092Q59,"I've seen the movie before, and wanted to own it in hard copy (dvd) because these old somewhat obscure films are hard to come by that way, moreso than big budget flicks, in my experience, anyway.  This film seems like it's really happening as filmed, and gets scarier too, as it moves along.  I had made a mistake while waiting for dvd, and mis--sent a request-&-problem meant for a totally different seller, to Bookgrove.  They expediently resolved it with me, so they are conscientious and prompt.",1403308800,,499,4.77906976744186
1876989,1,B000092Q59,"This piece of trash seems to be modeled after ""The Blair Witch Project"". Annoying hand held camera use and a fake interview that is made into a worthless dvd. This type of junk just clouds the understanding of one of the most tragic events in world history. This dvd exploits the murder and adds nothing of value to the understanding of the event. The directors and producers should hang their heads in shame. Hack work. It's a shame Amazon censored what I really thought of this junk or that I had to give it 1 star.  There should be a sub-star rating available.

I had never heard of the movie but have been fascinated with the JFK assassination and decided to give it a try.  Sure am glad I did.  Highly recommend it.

1876994,4,B000092Q59,"The Raymond Barry character is the reason to watch this ""Blair Witch Project"" style pseudo-documentary. He is chilling as a matter-of-fact old man who claims he was the second gunman in the JFK murder and now wants his 15 minutes of fame because he has a fatal illness and is going to die anyway. The maker never lets up once in the shaky camera style of following this dude around as he tries to prove his claim. This isn't a satisfyng film in that you won't necessarily believe this could be. But it does succeed on its own terms as a film that is true to its aims. I thought it was pretty good.",1385856000,,597,4.245614035087719

1877000,3,B000092Q59,"This is a terrific little one gag thriller, the central conceit being that an out of work camerman lives next door to the real assassin who shot JFK and now wants his 15 minutes. This slight idea is milked for maximum effect by director Burger and his cast.

Raymond J Barry is the real reason to see this movie. His steely, quitely spoken malevolence makes him one seriously scary and disturbed character-your in no doubt he's capable of taking down a President.

Barry's been doing stirling work in supporting roles for years. His other memorable bad guy is in the otherwise woeful 'The Chamber'-he's truly chilling as the unrepentant white supremacist. He also made a strong impression as Robert Duvall's boss in 'Falling Down'.

Highly recommended.",1206921600,,752,4.9523809523809526

7988730,5,B000092Q59,"I have to laugh at the people writing reviews of ""Found Footage"" movies like this one and stating that they were angry to find out that the footage isn't actually real, and they are just dramatic movies. Really? That's the entire idea of of the Found Footage genre people, they're fictional movies that are supposed to look like real film footage that was found after the fact. Then they give the movies 1 star because they are just so frustrated and angry and feel like they've been tricked or decieved. Well I'd say that if a Found Footage movie is convincing enough that you actually thought it was really film that was found after the fact, and the footage was so realistic that you got wrapped up in it and actually felt like you were decieved or robbed after watching it, then it must be a pretty damn good movie.

  ""Interview With the Assassin"" is a great example of a Found Footage movie that is also a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, and that keeps you invested in the seemingly true storyline. I love this genre of films, but Found Footage movies are only effective if the actors don't act. At all. And this is best achieved by basically having no script at all, but rather by just giving the cast a general summary of the storyline from start to finish, and very general descriptions of what each separate scene is about and what the goal of each scene is, and then just letting them put themselves into that story and just ""act"" through the movie as a regular person would. And that's what this movie did, and it does it beautifully.

  Once again, any Found Footage movie that has people posting very angry, resentful reviews because they actually thought the movie was a true documentary has accomplished its goal and done it well.",1498608000,,1786,4.513931888544891
