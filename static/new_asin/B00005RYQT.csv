7952819,5,B00005RYQT,"I use this film early in a course on women in film. Students are always amazed at the range and power of women in the early film industry, and this film, focused as it is on a pioneering screenwriter with a compelling personal story, really helps them feel more connected to an otherwise foreign past. I noticed one factual error (Lewis Milestone for directing, not Frances Marion for writing, was the first repeat Oscar winner), but in general, the information is good and the visuals wonderful.",1392076800,2,496,4.77906976744186
7952820,4,B00005RYQT,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to understand Frances Marion's very impressive place in screenwriting history. The film does a decent job of presenting the highlights of her life story, focusing on her heyday as the premier writer for Mary Pickford in the early years of Hollywood's silent film era. She found success in her career, fell in love, married a handsome stunt man and had two children. (She had it all!) The personal details of her life (her beautiful Hollywood home, her travels, her husband's tragic death) are revealed in the context of her career, as commented on by current women screenwriters, though the focus is more on her celebrity than her creative process or business dealings. I was surprised to learn there were so many women writing for films in the silent era, as there are so few these days. The reasons for that are not fully explored, however, as the documentary's main concern is with Marion's life and work in Hollywood. A major theme is that her early success resulted mainly from Pickford's largesse, and how they both benefitted from the collaboration. The writer and star are shown to be good friends, though once the talkies arrive, Marion proves more adept at sustaining her career.

Marion's role in resuscitating Marie Dressler's career was most interesting, and you get the sense she was really influential in Hollywood for quite a while, writing or cowriting many scripts that became film classics, such as ""The Champ,"" ""Anna Christie,"" Camille,"" ""Dinner at Eight,"" etc. I would like to have learned more about Marion's writing for Garbo, her collaboration with other screenwriters, and her business relations with producers. The documentary touches on these things, but does not go into much depth. We learn that even after her career in Hollywood faded, she never stopped creating, and continued to write, paint, and sculpt until the end. I admire her work ethic, intelligence, talent, and creativity, and her loyalty to friends, particularly other women in the industry that she celebrated and supported. I also enjoyed the addition of the sweet and sentimental ""A Little Princess,"" though the extended section about the imagined Araby went on far too long, as most reviewers point out. Still, it was beautifully and lavishly produced, with the magic of Hollywood in full evidence.

If you're a fan of the movies and want to know more about Hollywood's early years and one of its most successful screenwriters, you'll enjoy this DVD. It is not a substantial historical documentary, with critical insights and revelations about women's role in film behind the camera, but it is an enjoyable and interesting look at one woman who deserves acclaim and recognition for rising to the top in an industry now dominated by men.",1323475200,,2768,5.015217391304348
7952821,5,B00005RYQT,I loved this documentary very much the first time that I watched it again. It moved me. It is by far one of the best. Don't miss it!,1247270400,2,132,3.75
7952822,5,B00005RYQT,"Girl Power! I did not know that many of the best script writers, when Hollywood was just starting out, were women.

These aren't things they teach at school, and I grew up around Hollywood, California. Francis Marion is amazing, one tough cookie who wrote such movies as the Scarlet Letter (Lillian Gish) and others that have won the Academy Award.

Good to know, and I just love the old pictures with Mary Pickford, oh and the story about Marion's dashing husband and their romantic love story and what happened to that is just sad-beautiful.",1207267200,2,543,4.76595744680851
7952823,4,B00005RYQT,"Since this is a DVD double feature, I will review both elements separately.
Without Lying Down:
Take the second title very seriously, this is very much about women in Hollywood. I completely agree that the powerful women who worked behind the camera in the silent era have been unjustly forgotten but I do not feel that this mini-documentary cast any more light on them. But first, Frances Marion.
As a previous reviewer pointed out, this documentary does little to explore her creative methods and instead chooses to tell her story with interviews from modern filmmakers and historians as well as narrative and quotation. Some of the narrative is quite ridiculous. After the San Francisco earthquake, we are informed that Marion was ""empowered"" to seek employment. In other words, she needed money and got a job.
Kevin Brownlow and Leonard Maltin are intelligent and enjoyable interviewees and I was quite interested in what Marion's secretary and nephew had to say but I too found the modern filmmakers to be a bit superficial in their comments. Of course, this documentary was made when most of the main players in the silent era were dead but I feel that time could have been spent more wisely and in a more balanced manner. For example, we are not informed that Pickford made two films with DeMille after he quit from ""The Poor Little Rich Girl"" nor are we told that it was Lillian Gish who had creative control in ""The Scarlet Letter"" and ""The Wind"", although she was forced to put a happy ending on the latter. Such omissions were irritating. (Gish was a woman too, give her a little credit!)
We are told what a brilliant writer Marion was but are shown comparatively few clips of her work. I would have loved to see more of it so that I could judge for myself. Show, don't tell is the cardinal rule of writing.
On the other hand, the few clips included are good and Brownlow and Maltin's expertise are always welcome.
Overall: 3 stars
A Little Princess
The real reason I bought this disc, this is a charming Pickford film made at the height of her fame and beauty. While not a masterpiece on the scale of ""Stella Maris"" or as sweetly romantic as ""My Best Girl"" it does display Pickford's considerable talent. Zasu Pitts makes a very charming Becky and Norman Kerry (mostly remembered for ""The Phantom of the Opera"") is suitably heroic as Pickford's beloved father. Marion does a fine adaptation of the children's classic
So, a worthy Pickford vehicle that deserved to be released.
Overall: 4 stars
So, in conclusion, take the documentary with a grain of salt and enjoy the silent charm!",1083369600,11,2594,4.728476821192053
7952824,5,B00005RYQT,"This documentary is interesting, but I believe I am somewhat biased as I saw it only because I knew A Little Princess was on it.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mary's co-star was Francis Marion's husband. Also, the detailed description of the struggle to release Poor Little Rich Girl to the public is familiar to any who have read Mary Pickford's autobiography. There are many scenes of Francis and Mary together and constant reminders of how close they were.

This is almost like an addition documentary for Mary Pickford because most of the footage in it was not shown in Mary Pickford: A Life on Film.

It is also interesting to hear Mary speak candidly with Doug.

There were also several bonuses for myself in this film, including seeing Kevin Brownlow, a film historian I greatly admire, for the first time. Also, as a Little Rascals fan, seeing Jackie Cooper somewhat recently was also worth my time.

Finally, A Little Princess is very interesting as it is not released on any other tape. I agree with the dozens of critics who say the Ali Baba sequences are far too long, but it is somewhat interesting. I especially like the way they filmed Mary in the barrel.

Overall, I recommend this to any Mary Pickford fan, but I'm not sure if fans of Francis Marion will think it is up to par.",1069804800,2,1314,4.594017094017094
7952825,4,B00005RYQT,"I thought the documentary could be longer than 56 minutes if they put more effort into investigating Marion's talent a lot better than they did. The real reason I purchased this DVD was because it included a Mary Pickford film, A Little Princess (with ZaSu Pitts). That film is at least worth the purchase of this DVD.",1048550400,,318,4.5964912280701755
7952826,4,B00005RYQT,"Without Lying Down tells the story of Frances Marion an important screenwriter who wrote the scenarios for some of the best silent films. In its fairly short running time of 56 minutes it includes many clips from the movies she wrote. It is while showing these clips that the documentary is at its best. These films show Marion's talent. They show her ability to write believable characters involved in meaningful relationships. It is therefore a pity that the documentary does not investigate this talent more deeply. It does not really explain what was involved in writing a screenplay for a silent picture and why Frances Marion was so good at this. It sketches her life quite well, but really falls down in its inclusion of various modern screenwriters who use Marion's story to score political points. The comments of these filmmakers do not seem to be well informed. They do not appear to have any particular knowledge of silent film, let alone silent film writing. Moreover, their commentary is predictable and clichd. The documentary would have been much improved if it had left the analysis to experts like Kevin Brownlow and Leonard Maltin who make some insightful remarks during the course of the film.
Frances Marion for a time was Mary Pickford's favourite screenwriter, writing some of her best films. This DVD includes as a bonus one of the films they made together. I must confess that it is for this bonus that I bought the DVD and it makes up for whatever faults lie in the documentary. A Little Princess is a wonderful film. Pickford plays a little girl who is sent to a boarding school in London. She is rich, but her fortunes take a turn for the worse and her cruel headmistress makes her a scullery maid. She befriends fellow drudge Zazu Pitts (famous for her later performance in Greed). The interaction between Pitts and Pickford is superb and shows the talents of both actresses in depicting a very special friendship. My only criticism of this film is that it includes an Arabian knights interlude, with a veiled Pickford courting Ali Baba and fighting the forty thieves. It is good fun and shows Pickford's ability to play both adult and child roles in the same film, but takes up too great a proportion of the film's running time without really progressing the story. The black and white print of A Little Princess is good. It has some scratches, but the image is clear and sharp and detailed. Accompanying the film is a good piano score, by Jon Mirsalis. It follows the action well and has some suitably emotional themes.",1047686400,9,2550,4.771493212669683
