The girls look great and the wardrobe malfunctions are excellent (this is why I watch them) but you miss most of it because they use split screen which then reduces the size of each picture and you cant see what is happening.
When they go full screen it seems that when any thing good happens they keep the camera away or zoom out.

So in short ,this was an excellent set of oiled up girls wrestling...shame who ever put it together missed most of the good action.",1294963200,2,576,4.275229357798165
