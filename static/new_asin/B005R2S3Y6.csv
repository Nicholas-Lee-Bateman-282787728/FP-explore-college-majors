8536370,3,B005R2S3Y6,"This is a hard-core collection, and a nasty one at that. Nasty first of all because (with the notable exception of ""The Candy Store"") the players are gross, and second of all because some of the stuff included is too extreme for normal tastes; for instance implied incest, implied forced sex and actual male homosexual acts--you have been warned.

I couldn't even make it all the way through ""Innocent Girl"" (1975) because of this, and I spent a good portion of ""The Young Nymphs"" (1973) fast forwarding. The former for extreme content, the latter mainly because it was just gross and boring. ""Nymphs"" features a psychiatrist character and bunch of pseudo-scientific nonsense, as if it's a documentary. But it also is a little bit short on actual sex, and I have a feeling that much of what you do see is intercut from other sources.

Had the collection been limited to these two releases I'd have given it one star, but ""The Candy Store,"" with the amazing busty bombshell Candy Samples, elevates the whole thing. The production is better, the quality of  print is better, the audio is better, the sex is better and hands-down the women are MUCH better than in the other two movies (all three run about an hour each).",1390176000,6,1217,4.704225352112676
