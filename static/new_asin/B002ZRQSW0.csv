8385229,1,B002ZRQSW0,"This is actually pretty awful.  The narration sounds amateur and stilted, and it's like enduring a PowerPoint presentation from your great aunt about her grand tour of Australia.

I rarely am inspired to really hate something, but this managed it.  I lasted about three minutes.

The worst part is that I was searching for insomnia relief and had to get up and turn this off.  It's not just boring, it's annoying.  Just save yourself and skip it.",1475884800,,446,4.7272727272727275
8385230,1,B002ZRQSW0,The narration is terrible. I sounds like a young lady who is reading from a script which is rather annoying while watching. The pictures are fine but worst production I have seen in sometime.,1467072000,,191,4.647058823529412

8385233,1,B002ZRQSW0,Not presented in a way that is helpful when planning a trip.  This is just a woman visiting about her travels in Australia.,1389398400,,123,4.3478260869565215
8385234,1,B002ZRQSW0,"I was very excited to watch this as my trip to Australia is going to be Sydney, Melbourne and Tasmania.  This is not a video but a bunch of pictures with a narration.  The women who narratives has a very monotone voice.  There are four different routes.  There is one picture of Melbourne and then you move on.  I don't remember seeing a picture of Sydney.  There is very little information with regards to sightseeing.  This woman apparently camped her way around this area.  There are several referrals to which state campsite to stay at, how long to stay and what wildlife you can expect to see in the area.  For the average tourist this is not the video for you.",1362441600,,666,4.43801652892562
8385235,3,B002ZRQSW0,"Exploring Southeast Australia Including Tasmania was a helpful starting guide to my travel research.  It was a bit dry and choppy, but it's definitely a worthwhile watch for those doing travel research for Australia.",1361664000,,216,5.352941176470588

The price is comparable. It is found in the same travel section on Amazon. Thanks",1303689600,,257,4.48936170212766
8385237,5,B002ZRQSW0,"I'd recommend this video for prospective travelers to OZ. There are several  helpful tips that I'm happy to know about before going. It definitely is of interest for outdoorsy, nature folks...not particularly for city hoppers.
The enthusiasm of the narrator is contagious and the pictures are good. I am
soooo looking forward to my trip this summer.",1264032000,,349,5.12280701754386
