2559991,5,B000FBUFUY,"David Attwood has made a wonderful, historic drama that is perfect for those lazy Sundays when movie viewers are seeking a good film.  A young man from an upper class family accidentally riles a hardened Captain who takes it out on a polite, bumbling preacher.  The preacher's life becomes unbearable aboard the ship, ending in a horrific event that will haunt many long after they reach land.  The story has plenty of romance, drama and action...which leaves something for everyone, and the acting is superb.

2559992,2,B000FBUFUY,"I can usually watch British productions because the actors speak clearly.
This movie has no captions and the accents were too thick.

Production appeared to be very good.

Sellers should mention whether a movie has captions.",1192838400,9,224,5.194444444444445
2559993,4,B000FBUFUY,"This four and a half hour series, produced for television by BBC, would be a great adventure experience for any viewer.  Briefly, it is a saga of an 1814 voyage from England to Australia as seen from the point of view of a young English aristocrat who is embarking on a civil service career.
  However, there is far more than a thriller at sea for reader's of William Golding's trilogy on which it is based...and for which Golding received a Nobel Prize for literature.  The producers did a fine job of depicting young Edmund Talbot's growth from spoiled snob to humanitarian with a film that was mostly faithful to the novel. Casting was excellent--with a couple of exceptions-; and scenes of dramatic devlopment on a storm-tossed  ship ranged from extreme tension to hilarity.  The ending was undoubtedly adequate for the film-viewer only; but disappointing for lovers of the full message of the novel.",1192233600,38,904,4.875816993464053
2559994,4,B000FBUFUY,"(this is for the U.S. Format DVD, not available as of 11/5/06)

Found this 3 part film to be quite realistic and well-played.  Costumes, sets and acting all top notch, but would we expect anything less from the Masterpiece folks?

At times I found myself alternately hating and loving the main character which speaks to his acting skills.  The cramped horrible conditions of sea travel are so well-portrayed, I wanted to run outside after every episode and breathe in the fresh air. This is not a film for the claustrophobic.

Wished they would have added a few more long shots of the ship, most of the footage was close-ups of the vessel and interior shots which may or may not have been sets (we're still argueing about that here.)

Mysterious ""ghost"" appearances and the romantic interests (ranging from boyish frippery with the dames to hi-jinks, featuring off-camera buggery of the drunken parson by the scaliwags who populate the lower decks) would keep a wide range of audiences captivated.

Would have given 5 stars but for the heavily-accented dialogues of some of the mates which were barely intelligible and low-volume to my American ears.  However, the work is still a highly enjoyable film for anyone who is interested in history, ocean travel, english drama and more.",1162771200,10,1281,4.925581395348837
2559995,1,B000FBUFUY,"This film should have been rated Adult.  We turned it off after the rape scene, where the main actor tore off a woman's clothes and obviously raped her.  It is not for any teenager.  We felt violated by Netflix rating of the show as PG.",1512000000,,236,4.2

2559997,5,B000FBUFUY,"In the last passages, one of the characters points out that the journey of the ship with all of its catastrophes and mini-dramas is not an allegory nor an odyssey, but just a series of events. I think it was a bit of both, and if you are a fan of the dramatic language of the 17th century, you will find yourself echoing in the words of the actors.

I had hot running water, meclazine, and antibiotics if I had needed them. And a two hour helicopter ride to civilization when it was time to go home. I am the only professor on campus to have earned actual combat pay for teaching, and I am proud of the fact. I was terrified and thrilled to have survived a storm in a small boat (RHIB) at sea. But nothing I experienced ever approached the danger and deprivation of that kind of voyage! If you enjoy such things, watch this excellent and arduous tale!",1508112000,3,657,4.39344262295082
2560005,4,B000FBUFUY,A fine and entertaining movie.,1507939200,,30,5.2
2560006,4,B000FBUFUY,"This is a very well-acted period piece. At the center of it all is Edmund Talbot (Benjamin Cumberbatch),  a young, well-bred, somewhat priggish, English gentleman, who is in embarking on a sea voyage from England to Australia in the early 19th century. It appears that his godfather has secured a governmental post for him there. It will prove to be an unforgettable journey.

 The vessel he boards is an old warship that has been converted to a passenger ship. All those aboard the ship are voyaging voluntarily to Australia. So, this is not a story of convicts being sent involuntarily to Botany Bay. Still, the conditions on the boat or appalling, as the ship is a leaky, creaky old thing.  What passes for first class, private cabins is positively shocking, and the conditions for less privileged passengers makes one wonder why anyone in their right mind would voluntarily undertake such a journey. Still, the stark, dreary conditions lend a certain authenticity of time and place.

The Captain (Jared Harris)  runs a tight ship and will brook no nonsense from anyone, as Edmund Talbot soon finds out. There are some quite unfortunate events that occur both to passengers and crew alike that underscore the brutality and severity of conditions that were to be found aboard ship. Yet, despite this, even love manages to find a foothold. All that transpires goes into molding Edmund Talbot into a better man than the one who first embarked upon this arduous journey.

The acting is first rate, overall, and the costumes are all of the period and well-done. The story is based upon the Pulitzer Prize winning trilogy by William Golding. It is an excellent production, one that I enjoyed and recommend to those who like period pieces and seafaring tales.",1507507200,2,1755,4.908783783783784

2560008,5,B000FBUFUY,"If you've read Horatio Hornblower and the Patrick O'Brian novels, then this should be your cup of tea (or small beer). As some have written this is almost too realistic, hence vulgar, graphic, and seemingly lacking in character development, but what takes place in the ""revealing"" of the true character of these various peoples as the ship makes its way from England to Australia is quite remarkable. Almost as remarkable as  that which takes place in Emma and Pride and Prejudice, only the protagonist is something of a young man, something of a prig, not really likable, but played to perfection by B. Cumberbatch. The Captain and Lt. Summers, although it takes the full length of the film to bring this out, have a remarkable other worldly wisdom, backed no doubt by the experience of seemingly years of detached observation of both sailor and passenger. This slowly reveals itself and they become the true heroes of the Novel, or film. Really a feast for those who want the full blown experience, though lacking a little in the marvelous visual description of the  sea, wide expanse of stars and nature experience of Moby Dick.",1507334400,,1131,4.8549222797927465
2560009,3,B000FBUFUY,Not bad not too bad. Takes a bit to get into it. It does not just jump out and grab you. ( It is a BBC series they don't have too.

2560010,1,B000FBUFUY,"What?  Not one likable character in the three episodes I labored through.  Simply could not waste any more time on this.  The plot was oppressive as was the atmosphere of the ship.  The main character was an educated person of social standing, but failed miserably as being able to take care of himself.  He spent half his time in his bunk on the ship having sustained one injury after another due to sheer carelessness or stupidity.  The only thing I can say about the filthy ship being realistically portrayed is that one could actually smell its passengers and crew.  Very depressing to watch.",1507075200,3,596,4.728155339805825

2560012,4,B000FBUFUY,"Pretty good period piece.  It's interesting to see how ship board travel was like in those days.  It's also enlightening to see, in action, the ""captain as God"" reality that was required when journey's were so perilous.  So, interesting from those perspectives.  The story overall was nothing special to me.  I can rattle off 100 titles in which I enjoyed the overall story more.  But still worth the short time investment required (3 episodes X 90 minutes or so).",1506470400,,464,4.810126582278481
2560013,2,B000FBUFUY,"What a waste. Bad script, bad direction, very, very inefficient use of time with much time spent on unimportant things, and then skipping rapidly over character development and seemingly leaving out whole subplots from the original books. Or, if they DIDN'T leave out more subplots, then why did they waste 3 one-and-a-half hour episodes on a story that could have been better served with a 2-hour movie?
I'm only giving it 2 stars because of some pretty impressive special effects scenes on the ship. But this is one that I consider a waste of my time -- half an hour of interesting stuff, 4 hours that I ended up using to check emails in another window while I waited for something to happen.",1506297600,,694,4.650406504065041

You get to see what first class and coach class accommodations were like in those long distant traveling vessels.  And you gain insights about the dangers of sea voyages, along with sprinkles of romance that happened between some of their passengers.

2560091,2,B000FBUFUY,"I will give it 2 stars because of Cumberbatch's performance  He made the three 90 minute episodes at least tolerable.  The reviews made it sound like an adventure movie of a ship on the open water.  What you get is a lot of sea sickness, a lot about the discomfort of a long sea voyage on an old, wooden sailing ship, and far, far too much about the social interactions on board the ship.  I was also unable to get the sub-titles to work so much of the dialogue could not be understood.  Overall it was quite a disappointment.",1453161600,,526,4.2727272727272725

If it weren't for that, it would have been totally boring. It is SLOW. There isn't a lot of action or emotion. I found it hard to get through each 90 minute episode. The surprises (if you can call them that) happen and then they are over. No build up. No real aftermath.

2560106,5,B000FBUFUY,"Everyone else has pointed out the excellence of this series.  Just wanted to add that I wish it had subtitles or closed captioning.  As much as I love the English accent, with the additional background sounds of weather/ocean/or raised voices, it is very difficult to understand much of the dialogue.  Just an FYI, for anyone thinking they would make use of hearing assistance availability:  it isn't available!",1441670400,5,411,5.08955223880597
2560107,3,B000FBUFUY,"I enjoyed this DVD but it appeared to have been made in the 60's not in 2005. Very low budget - Virtually no CGI & no effort made to actually show what it might've looked like being at sea on a very long voyage where people spend hours looking over the rail at the wide expanse of the ocean. All such scenes were obviously filmed in a harbor on an anchored ship with the camera held high to avoid the tourists' heads. While the acting was top notch the story line had some serious holes in it. Our hero pounces passionately on the best looking female passenger early on, then kicks her to the curb immediately upon finishing with her & she fades gracefully into the background. Yeah, women scorned are always graceful & resigned. And especially the last scene where our hero sees the ship ablaze from a hillside manor & has time to run down to the shore, grab a boat - row out to the ship & climb aboard to find the first officer & still has time to save himself but the seasoned first officer (who was aboard the ship & could've just jumped overboard any time) perishes. Really lame. Jared Harris played a very believable sea captain.",1441238400,6,1135,4.3584905660377355

2560109,2,B000FBUFUY,Well being a fan of the Hornblower series and the genre I bought this in hopes of of another good seafaring adventure involving the golden age of sail. Well as it turns out there is very little in the way of ships crew or ship handling. It is more of a soap opera type series involving the passengers on the ship with a few of the ship's crew involvement from time to time. The occasional shot of the ocean is nothing more than a panning of the sun's glare on the water. I am disappointed in it because of this aspect. I also found the Captain's character to be fairly unbelievable. I watched the first two DVD's and may get around to watching the 3rd one of these days. And then again maybe not.,1441152000,2,696,4.201492537313433

2560116,5,B000FBUFUY,"Benedict Cumberbatch delivered a terrific performance as a young aristocrat coming of age in this historically accurate and believable rendition of what it was like to travel halfway around the world in the age of tall ships.  I thoroughly enjoyed all three episodes.  It's more of a story about the normal lives of relatively normal people.  I do also enjoy tales about the fighting ships of the era, but this isn't one of those; look elsewhere if you only want to watch swash being buckled.

My only quibble is that each episode ends with some not-quite-closed plot elements.  You know pretty well what will happen, but I look to the storyteller to show how it happened.",1438732800,2,672,4.758620689655173

The Hornblower series and ""Master and Commander"" make for better viewing--and certainly better escapism.

No one takes the high moral ground or even seems to care when a parson is abused.  Cumberbatch's (Sherlock) character takes advantage of a woman.  He is NOT a noble gentleman.  You actually SEE vomiting in the beginning, like the viewer had never heard of seasickness.  It was so gross.  This was such a disappointment.  I had wanted to see Cumberbatch in his early years but I couldn't finish this, it was that vulgar and explicit.  3 parts on 2 discs.

2560137,4,B000FBUFUY,"This was an interesting perspective of a voyage from England to Australia circa 1800 (about).  The premise is that of a young English noble traveling to take up a position within an Australian governor's administration.

I have not studied the maritime history of the English navy sufficiently to have an opinion on the historical accuracy, however, there were no glaringly obvious issues.  No one pulled out a pocket watch for example, there were no clocks.  The officers stated they knew the latitude, however, they were unaware of the longitude.  The quest for an accurate naval clock which could be used to determine longitudinal position is legend.

Personally, I enjoyed watching the story and will probably watch it again.  I will probably seek out the books and read them, although I am partial to autobiographical or factual accounts and yet prefer fictional movies (and even 'based on a true story' are fictional) to documentaries.",1421625600,,941,5.111111111111111

By the end I was sitting in front of the screen saying ""What do you mean that's the end? I want more!""

But, it did put you into the misery of confinement, the sense of being trapped aboard,  the relentless motion and rocking of the ocean. Cumberbatch and all the cast were very good.

2560174,4,B000FBUFUY,"If you are a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, you will love this film - especially if you've never seen him this young.  At first I was impatient with the languid pace of the film, but there is a dark mood to it which the great musical score accentuates.  Life aboard a large sailing vessel has never been depicted so artfully, and sometimes brutally.  The film grew on me with repeated viewings.

Young aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Cumberbatch) is arrogant, willful, and clumsy at human relations, yet his Achilles heel seems to be his emotional vulnerability.  Life aboard the sailing ship slaps him around a bit, and we see him learn and grow from a privileged brat into a young man suddenly aware that there are people who are different from him with whom he can still relate.  I can't think of another young actor with the gravitas necessary to play a 'kid' whose opinions are sought out by his elders and superiors.  Mesmerizing to watch, Cumberbatch is as skillful with non-verbal reactions as he is with dialogue and imbues Edmund Talbot with a burgeoning conscience and awareness of his actions as he narrates the film through his journal writing.  He plays a flawed character that you can't help but love and his comic timing is impeccably subtle.  He also excels at handling the physical demands of moving around on a gale-tossed sailing ship.  When he falls, slides around and collides with other people and objects, it somehow looks like elegant choreography (and did I say he's mesmerizing to watch?),  AND... DID YOU KNOW THAT CUMBERBATCH CAN SING REALLY WELL ? Check out episode #2, as he sings a few lines of opera while getting dressed.

The rest of the ensemble cast is really superb as well and the chemistry between Edmund and Miss Chumly is electric.  However, Cumberbatch's performance makes this film compelling and I can't imagine any other young actor filling these shoes.",1398038400,22,1891,4.817337461300309

His mettle is tested, and he studies his life from a slightly different vantage point, maturing and proving himself a gentleman after all. I found the  always-in-a grungy-ship setting bland at times but realistic. The conflict between classes/ stations in life, a sweet budding romance, the worrisome details of illness and injury in the face of a ship with no doctor or even near-adequate medical provision, storms and other perils at sea gave it character, but Cumberbatch made the miniseries. His portrayal of a young man in training to be a gentleman was elegant, sensitive, and realistic, depicting moments from rash and foolish decisions  (drunkenness and lust) to moments of tenderest romance and sincerity to a sublime appreciation for the beautiful as he was moved to tears on hearing music(whether or not associated with his head injury).

2560189,2,B000FBUFUY,"WHAT THE....??

That was me for most of this dvd. The fact that the books this miniseries is based on were written by the Lord of the Flies author should have told me that I was not in for a laughs-a-plenty tale of adventure on the high seas. Rather, I was in for a strange and sometimes meandering lesson on how repulsive human nature can be. Which is fine. If you're looking for that. But if you're not expecting it, it's not a pleasant surprise!

On the one hand, this is a well done miniseries. Well done as in great cast, great production and compelling script.

On the other hand, I will never again voluntarily watch this due to the inordinate amount of vomiting, pant-crapping (or, more accurately, nightdress-crapping?), farting, and generally animalistic behaviour. Illuminating, but not fun to watch.

2560190,5,B000FBUFUY,"The Movies: It's very good but has its weaknesses compared with the books - the movie version leaves out a lot, which is so often the case, but sometimes I wondered why some scenes that were vital in the books were altered of left out at all. The most drastic change surely being that Edmond is below deck when the ship faces the iceberg, one of his most important moments as a midshipman and one that has a drastic effect on his character in the end. Speaking of which, I was quite disappointed in the ending, I had higher hopes for it. The end makes the books even more special, something of which we are deprived here. Apart from that the casting is superb, the acting terrific, and the cinematography incredible considering it's 'merely' a TV special.

5 stars for the movie!

The DVD set: Here lies the true problem! I'm pretty sure this set is not even an official version - the cover looks as if it was slapped together using MS Paint and then printed out at home; the picture is bad, has quirks, and the DVDs didn't play properly, even though I've tried several players. some of which couldn't even read the first disc!

And the Pastors self destruction  over a sexual indiscretion was over the edge.  More then anything else it would have been nice if there were subtitles for the hearing impaired.

2560207,3,B000FBUFUY,"Let me preference this review by saying I had a keen interest in watching this film based on one reason - An English ancestor of mine, my great, great uncle, left northern England and sailed to Australia in the early 1800's to make a new life for his family. Through ancestry research, I've found relatives in Australia and New Zealand who are alive and decedents and pictures of the graves of the brave family travelers.  So, of course, I had a great interest in what it would be like on a ship sailing to the ends of the earth from top to bottom.

After seeing such stars as Benedict Cumberbatch, Sam Neill, Jared Harris, Victoria Hamilton, in the series, I had hoped to be in for a treat about life on a ship, the English separation of class, and the various interactions of the voyagers seeking out a new life elsewhere.  Frankly, as the story unfolded with each of its main themes for the three episodes, I wasn't as impressed as I had hoped to be in the substance of the series.  Nevertheless, life on the ship was an eye-opening experience from Edmund Talbot's first response upon entering the lower deck, ""What is that smell?""

I can only imagine what it was like for passengers throwing up from the tossing and turning, riveted with fear of the possibility of meeting a French war ship during the voyage, or stormy weather that takes water onto the ship and threatens the old converted battleship from sinking to the depths of the ocean.  My ancestors were not aristocrats, so as tiny as the little private cabins some were given, I have no doubt they were in the dark holes of the ship shoved in like rats for most of the voyage.  Frankly, we think some have it hard on cruise ships that have problems today.  Let's face it, we have no idea of the life of the poor and what they endured while those with titles received the small benefits of status.

Benedict was quite good, I thought, as he acted his voyage of travel and character realization.  The long trip and Talbot's actions to various situations serve to open his eyes to some questionable traits that cause him shame. The film is tag lined, after all, as ""An epic journey of self discovery.""

Jared Harris, who I recently saw hang himself in Mad Men, was alive and well as the captain of the ship. He played a great seasoned sailor, as well as those who portrayed the crew.  The other characters from a vicar to various individuals have their own side stories, personalities, and quirks.

Unfortunately, for me, I did not think it was a five-star wonder, but more of an eye opening voyage to what individuals endured traveling the stormy seas from the ends of the earth to get to a new world. For me a meaningful story leaves a lasting impression, and the only thing I felt impressed with was life on the ship and not the interactions and occurrences in the lives of the characters themselves.  There are instances of immorality that may shock some, but it's no different than portrayed in movies of the 21st century.  It's probably surprising because audiences may not wish to believe people were as indecent in that time period.  Human nature is human nature regardless of the era.

On top of the rest, I wondered how they filmed the scenes from watching the travelers tilt from one side to the other, while being jarred around on several occasions, or what ship they used for the movie.  If it had been me, I would have been barfing with the rest of them.  Perhaps the camera men were heaving over the side as well if they were on the open sea.

Now you know the scoop from all these reviews, if the experience of traveling abroad in such a fashion interests you, it's worth the watch.",1366502400,4,3658,4.505295007564296

2560210,3,B000FBUFUY,"While the  originally filming and production of this mini-series was probably high quality, this DVD transfer is very poorly done. Somewhere between the BBC and Timeless Media, the quality of this mini-series has been seriously degraded. Video quality is very poor, with a lack of contrast, overly-saturated colours and sound quality that varies between scenes.

The original production was filmed with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 or 4:3, ostensibly to fit the standard CRT TV format at that time.  Unfortunately, on this transfer, the 4:3 aspect ratio has been stretched to 16:9, resulting in a badly distorted image when all the other TV and DVD player settings are set at default.  So, if viewers wish to see the image in the correct Aspect Ratio, it's necessary to get into the DVD player's video settings and change the aspect ratio to correct this.

There's no excuse for this kind of transfer screwup.

As for the colour and contrast, little can be done because the DVD transfer material is so poorly done and there's only so much a viewer can do with the video settings on the DVD player and TV.

While these technical problems detract from the story, it was a treat to see a young Benedict Cumberbatch showing his mettle prior to his ""Sherlock"" and ""End of Parade"" roles.

Reviewers who complain about the story being vulgar, crude or boring appear have no concept of the harsh reality that many of our ancestors had to face when immigrating to a new land.
Some reviewers also display a breathtaking ignorance of the social structure and historical context of the time.  This production is not claiming to be some ""19th Century Reality TV Show"", but attempts to portray what happens when a cross-section of British society is forced to endure in a 'closed space' for many months at a time.  It's likely that some of these critical reviewers wouldn't understand ""Lord of the Flies"" either , if they could be bothered to read something other than the weekly ""illustrated fashion/movie star"" tabloid news.",1362355200,10,2009,4.865102639296188

It progressed from a snotty rich kid to a full grown man who learns that all of his actions have large consequences and that sometimes, the people who belong in your rank are not exactly your friends. the one thing i disliked was the way they portrayed the romance between Edmund and Ms. Chumley (i think that's her name) but aside from that, it's a good series to watch, somewhat true to the book but it is unnecessary to read it before hand for you to comprehend the themes of the story.",1361836800,,786,4.281879194630872

2560226,1,B000FBUFUY,"CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
The cast is competent--and marooned in a nearly plotless miniseries that gets more plodding and boring with each episode.  There's a lot of seasickness and vomiting, as well as urinating, defecating, farting, rashy and swollen genitals, and apparently gangrene from a complex fracture.  The latter somehow gets cured by an accident that straightens the broken leg.  Then it turns into a dislocated hip.  If it weren't for such pseudo-medical nonsense, the flick would almost seem like a Navy hygiene film.
There's an ongoing overtone of homoeroticism: references to sodomy, bare-butt shots, even men peeking under other men's blankets.  The one scene of man/woman sex is the now cinematically ubiquitous type involving rushed, half-dressed, almost violent copulation with the gal propped on a table or straddling the guy.
Obviously, this movie would garner few viewers if potential audiences knew about such content.  So the DVD has been packaged to look like an historical war epic.  The lead actor is pictured on the back, bloody faced, holding a sword.  Yet, in the storyline, his head wound is received clumsily bumping his head, and the expected foe turns out to be another British ship!  Worse, the photo on the front of the case displays Sam Neill as though he is the main star--when he is, in fact, a minor player who seldom appears through much of the movie.
The film's social messages regarding classism, sexism, and religion are so heavy-handed that there appears to be a presumption of viewer obtuseness.  And did English people really use such words as ""fellatio"" and ""fiance"" in colonial times?",1336867200,39,1632,5.124528301886793
2560227,3,B000FBUFUY,If you are into maritime history and the the beginnings of a colony this is a good movie.  There are known actors who give a very good  perfromance.  It shows what life might have been like on board an old sailing ship.  It gives a good portrayal of Great Britian's stratified society during the hieght of it's empire.,1336780800,,318,4.431034482758621
2560228,5,B000FBUFUY,"I was disappointed to see so many negative reviews on such a splendid trilogy. The first thing that sticks out to me is the acting. Not one single character in the entire cast of any of the episodes feels like an ""extra"". Each character is a person, breathing with life and making the atmosphere absolutely mesmerizing. If you have an appreciation for such a thing, you'll appreciate this.

 Unfortunately I couldn't get subtitles when I watched ThEotE. My only issue when the trilogy is that I felt like I missed a great deal of the lines being spoken. This made some scenes difficult to follow, leaving me to either figure out what happened through character reactions, after the fact, or by rewinding the scene here and there.

 Secondly, you have to realize that this is not a feel-good movie. It is emotional, substantial, and occasionally confusing. It is the surprisingly enrapturing tale of a naive young well-to-do man suddenly being exposed to the dynamic and horrible differences between the social classes. His growth throughout the trilogy is both obvious and astounding. No, you will not feel good watching To the Ends of the Earth. At the same time, however, you'll find yourself shouting at the screen when a character makes a poor decision or does a particular action. You'll find yourself thinking about it after.

 Simply put, To the Ends of the Earth does remind me of something that might have been shown to us in school and used for discussion and analysis. But it is enjoyable. And yes, there is one hilariously odd sex scene and a painfully awkward and perplexing ""romantic"" endeavor, but it does not stop To the Ends of the Earth from being both captivating and memorable.",1334534400,5,1697,4.814432989690721

I dislike the main character, his acting and the character he portrays.  In fact, there isn't one character with redeeming qualities in this movie.  It went from bad to worse.  I couldn't quite finish the first disc, and will be shredding both of them.  I couldn't recommend them to anyone, so how could I even donate them?  People cruel to others, gratuitous sex, vomiting, defecating, who knows what else, but I finally had enough.  I know horrible things happen in this world, but I don't have to dwell on them nor partake in watching and planting indelible pictures in my mind.",1332028800,39,704,4.523809523809524
2560232,2,B000FBUFUY,"I sat through many things I didn't like, because there was so much I did like: the actors, the atmosphere, the clothing and sets, the realism...and especially the interesting development of relationships between various kinds of people...and seeing what danger and stress bring out in their characters, especially when they are crammed together in close quarters.  It's amazing to imagine being at sea for months, with all kinds of inconvenience and hardship, in a relatively tiny ship where you can't really get away from anyone for long.

In a movie like this, I know there has to be tragedy and suspense, disaster and disappointment, to make the story more like ""real life"" and to keep us watching and caring what happens.  But there was too much for my taste.  I couldn't stand to see the clergyman humiliated and horribly abused (I thought the sailors were going to end up drowning him, and had to fast-forward to be sure they didn't, or I would have stopped the movie right there).  I skipped around to make sure it wasn't going to get much worse, and it seemed the worst things were in the first episode.  Reassured somewhat, I continued to the end, becoming attached to several characters, particularly Lt. Summers, and hoping that Edmund Talbot would receive some happiness to make up for all he'd been through.

But just when I thought we'd safely reached the shore, with the story wrapping up nicely, not much to fear now and instead, much to hope for, Edmund is rewarded with a senseless tragedy: the loss of a good friend and a great man, one whom I'd personally become quite fond of.  If there were any justification for his death, maybe I could handle it, but for the lieutenant to be appointed captain only to ""go down with his ship""--anchored in the harbor!?!?!  In a stupid fire?!?  With nobody else on board?  I thought Edmund was going to rescue him--but instead there's a stupid, confused exchange on board the burning ship, Edmund jumps in the water, badly burned, and we hear no more about Lt. Summers.  The next scene shows Edmund receiving news of his godfather's death.  And how are we supposed to feel about that, considering how much of the story had his godfather at its foundation--and indeed, it was all told for his benefit alone?  Why should he die now, before reading it?  Stupid.  Some writers seem to feel that if the plot is dragging a bit or if everyone is too happy, it's time to kill off a favorite character or heap a little more tragedy on the protagonist.  This seems to me a remarkably lazy way to ""write a story.""

I'm not even sure this ""going down with the ship"" scenario is realistic.  My father was a Navy officer and I asked him about that once, and he said it's okay for the captain to leave if everyone else is safely off.  I can't find anything online to see if that was true in the era this story was written (there are too many current stories about the Concordia dominating search results), but I would think so.  Why waste a good officer on a doomed, rotten old ship that wasn't fit to be sent across the ocean in the first place?  Anyway, the final 10 minutes of the film took my rating from 4 stars to 2, and I'm sorry I can't reward the producers/writers/actors/etc. more for all the work they put into it, but when they leave a sour taste in viewers' mouths, viewers are unlikely to feel warm and cordial, recommend it...or ever to watch it again.  Honestly, not to overdo the criticism (I hope), but if you're going to have a major character die, after getting us all really liking him, foreshadowing is a kind and customary thing to do.  I saw none.

Beyond this, I found it hard at times to understand what was really going on, when the danger had to do with things going wrong with the ship.  I understood a lot of it (storms and sudden winds, for example), but couldn't quite be sure what they were doing with the ropes around the bow (?) or what broke off and how that affected the ship, or how in the world red-hot iron fixed the mast...so I guess I needed a scientist or sailor at my side to explain.  That's not fair.  I also couldn't understand where Benet was, when they were trying to avoid the iceberg.  He was conspicuously absent at a time when he should have been a ""hero.""  Several characters had a strange tendency to disappear when no longer ""needed.""  What happened to the curly blond woman who was so prominent in Episode 1?  She must have been still on the ship, but I don't think I saw her at all by Ep. 3.

And finally, it was silly to finish up a movie that was supposed to be about so many things--mainly developing the character and understanding of Mr. Talbot--with the idea that reuniting him with his little ladylove was going to fix everything.  It seems to trivialize the whole voyage.  I mean, I'm happy they didn't kill her off, but the movie wasn't supposed to be a romance, so a sappy romanticized ending didn't seem appropriate.  However, maybe Mrs. Prettiman already did the trivializing by cutting down Edmund's ideas about the voyage.  I thought he did indeed seem to grow a lot and discover valuable truths during it, but she tells him ""not to refine upon it,"" for it was nothing more than ""a series of events.""  That seems unfair, and shows her to be more unfeeling than she previously seemed, but maybe I'll borrow her attitude now.  This movie was a series of made-up events, and in the end, I don't like how they were made up, so I'll just dismiss the whole thing.

I gathered from comments here that the screenwriter died while the film was unfinished, and perhaps that's what killed it.  It all seems very unfortunate.

***** Nope, I just stopped and looked for more info, and found out that the plot more or less followed the book (although it was supposed to be an explosion that killed the lieutenant, not his own ""gallantry.""  A little more believable, but still pointless.  Anyway, I'll blame Golding.  I certainly didn't like The Lord of the Flies.  So next time I'll do more research before jumping into an unknown movie just because it looks pretty!  Okay, I'm done whining now.  ;-)",1330819200,8,6099,4.542124542124542

The gradual transformation of the young condescending aristocrat Edmund Talbot was underplayed and not defined clearly enough and kept back stepping.
Just when you think the unlikeable Edmund Talbot has maybe learnt a lesson in life he hadn't.
This was evident in a scene with Lieutenant Summers and the sudden reversal of his supposed softening personality when it revealed the Lieutenant had not come from his class.

2560253,5,B000FBUFUY,"4 and 1/2 hours in one sitting is to me the hallmark of what makes a miniseries exciting, exhilarating, involving and totally engrossing; when I can barely make time to go to the bathroom or bother to eat something because a film is THAT grand in scope and magnitude, then I take off my hat to the the BBC for a job well done to David Attwood's British star-powered TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH.

First off, The trilogy of novels from which Leigh Jackson, Tony Basgallop and Lynn Hersford (who finished up this project upon Jackson's death)  adapted this series, were written by England's Poet-Laureate , William Golding ( anyone who has read any of Golding's novels knows that he explores the darker side of human nature!!!)  With that in place, TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH  is just that- one man, young Lord Edmond Talbot's self-discovery about the just and the unjust, seedy  sides of mankind; this is all learned and ""journaled"" on a perilous, eye-opening voyage aboard an 18th-century passenger ship boarding in England and sailing to Sydney, Australia (The Antipodes). As passenger of highest born rank, the young Talbot (pronounced Talbert) learns about real life, apart from his noble rank and privilege which involves the mysterious ""murder and buggering"" of a Reverend, the suicide of a cabin keeper, dirty politics upon the High Seas and the cover up of dastardly deeds of crewman.  This drama series is as full of mystery and intrigue as it is entertaining and downright comical!!!  No small wonder, in that David Attwood,  who in 1996 brought to the screen a similar treatment of Daniel Dafoe's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fortunes-Misfortunes-of-Moll-Flanders/dp/B00006BSDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fortunes & Misfortunes of Moll Flanders</a>, now has performed his similar magic with Golding's three stories with great success!  One minute you are spellbound, and the next you are laughing.  Attwood understands the necessity of building tension and the importance of a release valve!

The true star of this series is Benedict Cumberbatch, as Edmond Talbot, who one year later recorded a similar triumph as William Pitt The Younger in Michael Apted's big screen biopic of abolitionist William Wilberforce in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazing-Grace/dp/B000VNMMQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazing Grace</a>. Cumberbatch is in every demanding, dialogue-laden, ship-tilting scene and the grace and power of his abilities, again, is undeniable.  Cumberbatch is proving to be one of England's rising stars with his classically trained acting and his incredible sense of character that makes this series an immense pleasure to watch. He is as skilled an actor as any out right now.  The viewer is put at total ease and assurance with the entire cast of seasoned English actors plus Australian-born veteran Sam Neill (who is most present in Episode 3) who combine with uniformly outstanding performances in this well crafted saga of real life aboard a sea ship of the time.

Unlike many ""cleaner"" drama serials such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horatio-Hornblower-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000AYEIW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horatio Hornblower Collector's Edition</a>&nbsp;which concern the valour and honour of the 18th-century Royal Navy, TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH is more intent of presenting all of the warts, belching, farts, and ""indelicacies"" of sea life that are far more accurate in accounting what ship passage was actually like.  The camera work is ingenious in the steadiness that it displays while watching the passengers suffer from ""riding the ship"" (getting their ""sea legs"") as well as suffering from ""mal de Mer"" (sea-sicknesses).  Having been aboard the Revolutionary War Frigate ""The Constellation"" that is anchored in Baltimore Harbour, I can attest that a series could not be more accurate at the depicting the dark, dank accommodations of cramped cabin life in the underbelly of a ship!!!

Some of the interesting points that I would like to observe: (1) the music and dances aboard ship are done live (which to a musician is noted and much appreciated. No fake cello, flute or violin players HERE!) (2) The underbelly of the ship is scaled to five feet in height (normal for the time) which makes Cumberbatch's unusual 6 -foot height all the more interesting. (3) The SHIP is tossed so that the actors must adapt, NOT the camera tossing to and fro making the viewer sick! (note my comments on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Adams-HBO-Miniseries/dp/B000WGWQG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Adams (HBO Miniseries)</a>!!!) (4) The costuming is 100% accurate, and the manners and customs of the time are well noted and observed.

The only downside that I found with this series, is that Episode 3 seems rushed and edited more quickly (probably due to the death of screenplay adapter Leigh Jackson) than Episodes 1 and 2. Also, for those who have problems dealing with a myriad of English accents, alas, there are no subtitles.  I found no problem because the diction, even with the lowest ranking  sailors, is quite clear; still some may find it problematic. With those two caveats, I still highly recommend this two disc, three-part drama series as one of the finest and most absorbing mini-series of any kind.

2560254,3,B000FBUFUY,"This miniseries follows the long journey of a British nobleman to Australia where he will work in government. The ship he travels on is crewed by a unscrupulous Captain and crew. I found the series entertaining enough. The main character, Talbot, was likeable. Unfortunately, I liked few other members of his crew except perhaps his manservant.

The film seems to go out of its way to show how unpleasant ship's life was. From farting, belching and prolific vomiting to scenes showing the characters using the head. I grew bored after the fifth time a character was portrayed retching. Okay. We get it. The waves are choppy, people are getting seasick.

I would suggest this film for mature teens to adults only.",1203033600,14,712,4.87603305785124

8120508,4,B000FBUFUY,"Both my wife and I were put off by the graphic depictions of violence and sexual activity in the first episode. I could not find a rating for the series, which should be ""TV-MA"" at least: In my opinion it is not suitable for (or even understandable by) anyone under the age of 30! However, I would probably not have seen ""Rites of Passage"" if it had been rated appropriately, and that would have been unfortunate. The story is less about the perils of 19th century sea travel than (much like Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"") about those close social circumstances that strip away the thin veneer of civility overlaying the ugly reality of our animal passions, abuses of power, and the folly of relying on society's supposed protections from them. Also, to quote Reverend Colley's paraphrase of Matthew 15:11, ""It is not what others do to a man that defiles him, but that which he himself does...."" The story operates on so many levels that both my wife and I were reflecting on and discussing its themes for days, and I consider the story and this video adaptation nothing short of brilliant.",1518134400,,1090,4.652849740932642
