7796467,1,1565234111,"Utterly useless to me.  As a woodworker i had certain questions about using a scroll saw, this dvd answered none of them.  It never explained which blade to use for hard or soft would or if i mattered, what speed to best be used or if that mattered.  Showed no techniques for going around tight corners except to slow down and watch the line, like i didn't know that. I thought the presenters blades was set alittle loose, I watched it flex alittle and when cutting corners wouldnt enter the wood at the same place. A few times after he would start a cut he would stop and change the speed and never explain why, i don't know if it was just cutting to fast for him or if there was another reason.  Near the end i could hear people talking off camera.  The only thing i learned was the more teeth the blade has the faster it cuts, which as soon as he said i thought well yea cant believe that never dawned on me.  all in all not impressed, all that was done was projects no really teaching or explanations.",1412035200,2,1005,4.208333333333333

Now enter the realm of all things wood, a fairy tale land of ginger and spice. It is the workshop of a Mr. John Burke, quite possibly the REAL Santa Claus, but he's not saying. We are privy to the making of an assortment of goodies: a jigsaw puzzle in the shape of a pig, Christmas tree ornaments, balloons, fish and birds. Bright colored letters spell out children's names--only for good little boys and little girls.

Today we'll be cutting our statuette. If you haven't already done so, locate the ""hold down"" piece (AKA the ""guard"") on your scroll saw and remove it. You, alone, must hold down your work.

Start by cutting off sections of background material. This brings you closer to your cutting lines.

Notice John's hands/fingers touching the table while at the same time he is cutting his workpiece. The table is serving to stabilize his hands while his fingers direct the workpiece into the blade. Hand-table contact = STABILITY + CONTROL. Experienced hands keep in touch with the table.

YOU are in charge; NOT the machine. John, at one point, holds his workpiece in place. Meanwhile, his scroll saw continues to run. WORK speed and MACHINE speed do not coincide. Scroll saws are different than sewing machines. Vary your work speed at YOUR convenience regardless of machine speed. YOU are in charge.

Crafting face, ears and hands requires some practice. Like anything else your experience will triumph. Remember: NEVER USE A CURVE IN PLACE OF AN ANGLE and include as much detail as you can. Detail will give you that ""WOW!"" factor. Soon you'll be a regular Michelangelo!

As for this DVD, I'm left disappointed. The difference between angles and curves is forsaken as John transmutes all of his angles to curves. No explanation is offered therein. ""Angle,"" the word, goes unheard throughout.

Be that as it may, I find it to be a pleasant sixty-five minute interlude though quite unessential save for that which I've mentioned. A ""must have"" it's not. You can take it or leave it, though I do so love hearing his DeWalt scroll saw hum.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DEWALT-20-in-Variable-Speed-Scroll-Saw/dp/B004I0VRE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DEWALT - 20 in.

7796469,2,1565234111,"Boring presentation. This is not a guide you will return to. Just a guy creating projects and lots and lots of video of him using his saw. Sure to kill your desire to use your saw. Buy a book instead, any book would be better. There would be a long list of the things he does not cover and a very short list of the things he does, but I can't remember one.",1264896000,5,356,3.8904109589041096
