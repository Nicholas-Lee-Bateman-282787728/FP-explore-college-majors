There are no skips or yips in the video, and the sound is excellent without any variations in the tone or volume. It is much as I remember The Big Picture broadcasts from my youth. It is a bit humorous to see the lengths to which the scriptwriters moved to endorse our American way of life during the birth of the Cold War. It is, nonetheless, a very good documentary on the Lodge Act itself, the hardships many of the soldiers endured to become American citizens, and also their willingness to remain in the military in defense of their newly adopted nation.
As an aside, currently working in a history office, I can appreciate the creation of the program, the risks taken to become an American, and the contributions these individuals made to the country through their dedication and sacrifices during a critical time of need. Although not a completely fitting tribute to the Lodge Act and those individuals, it is a good starting point for those who want to remember them, in spite of the back-handed attempt by the US Army to turn the events depicted within as some sort of political triumph.",1255046400,,1166,4.610576923076923
