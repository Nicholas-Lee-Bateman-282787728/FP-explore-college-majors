8407872,4,B003X8HMXY,"L'Arcano Incantatore (Pupi Avati, 1996)

Those outside Europe aware of Pupi Avati probably know him from his 1976 giallo classic The House with Laughing Windows, though serious film buffs are also aware Avati was also an uncredited writer on Pier Paolo Pasolini's infamous Salo the year before. Avati, who's also a novelist in his spare time(!), has never stopped working, and in general his films seem well-received in most parts of the world; why do we not get them here? While L'Arcano Incantatore is not deathless cinema by any means, it's certainly better than many horror movies I've seen in the recent past.

Giacomo Vigetti (Stefano Dionisi, recently of Vivaldi: The Prince of Venice and Argento's Non ho Sonno) is a priest. Or, was a priest. He's been convicted by a tribunal of seducing a young girl, and flees his seminary for the countryside. A seemingly helpful old woman sends him off to another defrocked priest in the area, known as L'Arcano Incantatore (The Red Violin's Carlo Cecchi). The enchanter needs a new secretary; the last one, Nerio, came to some sort of bad end that doesn't get discussed at home. Giacomo and the enchanter, after something of a wary start, begin to get along, but strange things start happening around the tower, and the enchanter fears that Nerio may have come back from the grave to terrorize the pair.

While Italian horror films underwent a sea change in the late sixties and early seventies--the Italians, thanks mostly to Dario Argento, were among the first to really take the idea of extreme, graphic horror farther than H. G. Lewis and George Romero had--back in the early days, the Italians were big on atmospheric horror, along with everyone else. Avati hearkens back to the days of the atmospheric horror film here, relying on the sets, the camerawork, and the script to bring the chills. There are some special effects, but for the most part they're understated, especially compared to recent American and Asian horror flicks, which have gone heavy on special effects even when trying for atmosphere. As a result, this is a slower horror film than one expects from a modern movie, but that is in no way a bad thing; think of it as a look back to how things used to be done, not necessarily because Avati thinks that's the way it should be, but because he seems to have equal affection for both ways of doing things. He's also quite accomplished doing both. This is a movie to sit back, relax, pay attention to, and be entertained by. I suggest you do so. *** ",1285113600,8,2517,4.752860411899314
