8174388,4,B000FUF6YA,"This is a good double feature DVD with lots of silly jokes and plenty of classic burlesque strip shows! The comedy skits are funny, corny and very classic for that time! And the ladies (can't forget them!) that strip are absolutely gorgeous and know how to strip with class, taste and style!

Highly recommended for anyone that likes vintage burlesque and classic comedy jokes!

It's not in color and just mild, wild nudity, wearing pasties, shaking and grinding!

Go buy it!",1305590400,9,475,4.839506172839506
