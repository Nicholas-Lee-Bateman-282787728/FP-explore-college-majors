This is a super show; I taped as many episodes as I could on the old VCR.  What a great opportunity to now get them on DVD and not have to watch the commercials.  (Although the commercials from those days are entertaining in themselves.)  To quote another reviewer ""BRAVO"" for finally putting this on DVD.",1082937600,8,430,4.756756756756757

1992401,5,B0001DMXEC,"I think The Waltons is one of the best shows that has ever been on television.  I loved it as a child, and I still love it today.  Particularly good are the first two seasons of this series.  The first season is virtually poetic in its well-written scripts and beautifully evocative music.  I also particularly appreciate the fully developed characters of Zeb and Esther Walton, the grandparents.  So few TV programs or movies of any kind give proper attention to presenting, let alone developing, over-60-year-old characters in their story lines.  The importance and complexity of these two people, so beautifully portrayed by Will Geer and Ellen Corby, I have come to appreciate more and more as I have gotten older.  My Texas-born mother grew up during the Depression (she would have been about Elizabeth's age, the youngest of the Walton children), and I remember her telling me that she almost couldn't bear to watch The Waltons because the stories and the superb actors so perfectly captured her childhood experiences that she was overwhelmed by the poignant memories it evoked.  I am so thankful that Mrs. Paley insisted to her husband, the head of CBS, that he keep The Waltons on the air when the series first began until it could build an audience. And I am so thankful to have the opportunity to watch this quality program again!",1483920000,4,1340,4.8464912280701755

I'm really starting to wonder if the money I spent on Fire TV was really worth it. I can get anything I want on HULU and Netflix without purchasing or renting the season or episode.
So, The review is for the show and not for Fire TV. If it were a review of Fire TV, it would be 1 Star and Negative 5 if that were an option.",1475539200,,460,4.010869565217392

1992458,5,B0001DMXEC,"You might find old shows like this on TV Land but I heard that the commercials have become very inappropriate (June 2015).  I would NEVER exposed almost-nudity-commercials to my children. Consequently, I have taken over our televisions and I buy and rent (from NF) so I can screen movies/shows before my family views.  I purchased the LIttle House on the Prairie series (Seasons 1, 2, 3 [so far]) and now, I purchased The Waltons, Season 1 (five discs) BUT to my surprised there is one episode where a woman is wearing a bathing-suit or sensual outfit for the circus - very bad example for my children. The first episode includes a love story plot between John-boy and girl. The last three episodes look clean and what I would allow my family to watch.  I had to come back and edit my review, after fast-forwarding, all episodes.

My two nitpicks are with the DVD's themselves (So far, the same for S 1, 2 & 3)
Problem one:  No English subtitles.  The person watching these DVD's is nearly deaf, so.....  The TV versions that show up, filled with ads, do have both CC and English subtitles, if one chooses.
Problem two:  DVD transfer itself is poor quality.  Not much effort made to clean it up a bit.  Scenes at night are basically completely dark.

Positives are that the sound quality itself is good.  Picture quality on brightly lit scenes is fine.",1464825600,3,641,4.610619469026549

Without even trying or having to preach, it helped to instill in her a ""can do"" attitude, as well as a deep and abiding respect for elders, and a commitment to helping out the family.  The idea that the work the children do actually contributes - it's not chores, it's not busy work, it's NEEDED for the family to get by - made her take great pride in bringing in our firewood to keep the house heated.  Never hear nor heard a complaint from her, never shirked her duty, never procrastinated.

1992506,5,B0001DMXEC,"The problems mentioned in the 1 and 2 star reviews seem to have been fixed because all of the episodes are now on one side and they all play perfectly.  Some seasons only offered the latest dvd's created in 2012, while others offered both 2012 and 2007 productions.  I chose the 2012 productions for seasons 1 through 5, even though for one of those seasons I had to pay $19 + vs. $12.00 (or so).  The higher price was worth it if it meant no double-sided dvd's.  There are mostly 5  episodes to each dvd with an occasional 4-episode disc.  After watching Dish network reruns that kept getting more and more chopped up to make way for more and more commercials, it's refreshing to see the shows in their entirety.  I had completely forgotten about those scenes so what a surprise!  I couldn't be happier with the set.  I lost interest after John-boy left the show and the writers started getting soap opera on me.  There's no adequate replacement for John and Olivia----certainly not Rose.  As the years rolled on it completely lost its charm for me as the principle characters started disappearing and bizarre changes (like Mary Ellen's son suddenly becoming a girl----huh??) and the recreation of John Boy was a total turn off.  It bore little resemblance to the first 5 seasons.  I may get season 6 as it has redeemable qualities.  From the 1980's on, it's definitely over.  It's a personal thing and has nothing to do with the quality of the dvd's.",1446595200,2,1452,4.6171875

It's about a very large family just trying to make it through the great depression the best way they can. It has heart warming moments and life lessons throughout the story lines. It's a shame that the world today doesn't share some of the same values as they did when the real family was still alive. The world would be a better place.

Richard Thomas plays the role of John Boy, a youth becoming a man during The Great Depression struggling to become an author. He writes chapter after chapter of his life from episode to episode about his life on Waltons Mountain and the love of a loving family. This is a show loved by highly moral people because it has no cussing, violence, or nudity. NONE. Some episodes feature religious ideas but even then they do not preach it.

In season 6 (or maybe 7, I don't remember very well) the mom got sick with tuberculosis and never came back, I hope the actress performing this role did not get sick too. John Boy did not appear at all in seasons 8 and 9, and the new actor for this role couldn't get the essence of the character. John Boy was sensitive and strong, he was a noble man with a strong character, and he was a leader, the center of his family. The new actor was missing personality and disappeared from the center of the story.

1992601,5,B0001DMXEC,"I have watched The Walton's for years and about very winter when my budget shrinks due to having less work, I re-watch it. I like Seasons 1-7 (there are Seasons 8 and 9 but the leading actors are all gone in these last two Seasons). The last two seasons were carried by and large by the children, now grown, because after Richard Thomas left the series, Michael Learned is almost not in any of the episodes, even in Season 7, the grandfather (Will Gear) passed, sadly, and the grandmother (Ellen Corby) was out of many latter episodes due to her stroke.

The series in retrospect is not as saccharine as many people remember. Yes, while it is about ""values,"" it is also about timeless values, beautifully presented. The Walton family had tough times: arguments, health issues, jealousy, hate, death, over-zealous evangelists ... and more. They didn't always come out shining in the light but showed us how to live with wounds. The performances by Richard Thomas, who created one of the all time great television characters as John Boy, Ralph Waite as the father, Michael Learned at the mother and, of course, the grandparents, Will Gear and Ellen Corby, will live on for their contribution to ""better television"" and respective talents as actors.",1406160000,,1246,4.849765258215962

The packaging is standard with most DVD sets and the quality of the pictures are fine.",1395619200,,334,4.403225806451613

1992622,5,B0001DMXEC,"This is so warm and wonderful.  Thank God there was an Earl Hamner, who was willing to write about and share his personal family experiences with all of us.  No, we didn't live in the Blue Ridge Mountains, but it brought back so many memories of my loving, caring family that I grew up in.  The ""Waltons"" were like FAMILY, filled with love, fun, warning, caution and appreciation of one another.  Thank you ""Earl Hamner"" for reminding us all of what once existed in America from house hold to house hold.  We all had a bit of the ""Waltons"" in our households as we grew up.  If you didn't, you missed A LOT in your personal LIFE.  This is so classical, it will be viewed for generations, as it should be.  It deserves 10 Stars, but only 5 are allowed!",1392163200,,750,4.307142857142857

1992624,5,B0001DMXEC,THIS IS A CLEAN FAMILY SHOW LOVED THE WALTONS PLAN BUYING THE WHOLE TV SERIES AS THEY NEED MORE FAMILY CLEAN SHOWS  LIKE THIS ON TV,1391558400,,131,4.038461538461538
1992625,5,B0001DMXEC,"After a warmly received TV movie in 1971 called The Homecoming, creator Earl Hamner decided to make a TV show based on the same family called The Waltons. This move created a show that will never be forgotten in American history.

The Waltons deals with a family of 11 named the Waltons as they face situations on their rural mountain home, Walton's Mountain. The show takes place during The Great Depression in 1933 and runs all the way up to 1946. In is show you'll see heartwarming moments, heartbreaking moments, and rather shocking moments.

This first season ran during the 1972-1973 season. Season 1 has many marvelous episodes. The Waltons become kin to you after you watch a few episodes and you'll want to watch all you could of this show. They don't make TV like this anymore so please buy this season and the others. While the show was at its best from seasons 1-6, 7-9 are okay but not too great.",1391299200,,909,4.570552147239264
1992626,5,B0001DMXEC,"This show was set in the depression era, but I'm sure times were even harder than depicted. However, this nostalgic show was never about the hardships but about developing relationships with trust and kindness. Although the first show, The Foundling, shows John-boy stealing a kiss from his love interest, the lack of sexual innuendo makes for wholesome family viewing. This was purchased for my grandchildren, but I enjoyed watching the episodes with them and explaining how people lived during hard times.",1391212800,,507,5.271604938271605
1992627,5,B0001DMXEC,"Good DVD's, great to have this precious family series preserved.  I have already bought a set for a friend and she is loving it.",1390521600,,128,4.333333333333333
1992628,5,B0001DMXEC,When this season was playing I was overseas so each episode is fresh and the stories are all good. Great entertainment.,1390348800,,119,4.714285714285714
1992629,5,B0001DMXEC,"Perhaps the Waltons is a wee bit idealized, but it's a close approximation of the locus of American life in the rural mid-Atlantic of the mid-20th Century.  If you are looking for wholesome entertainment for the entire family that does not require adult pre-screening, and you are sick and tired of the absolute trash on cable and network TV, you will give yourself and your kids a hefty helping of values as they once were framed.  And yes, the meta-narrative of the Waltons does link full faith practice to an emotionally and culturally connected family.  In other words, you'll see people young and old who are imperfect of course, but who are attempting to live by the golden rule, and more particularly, in the light of the Creator.  But viewers are never hit over the head with this message.  It's just part of who they are and their acknowledgement of universal order.

Incidentally, I am enjoying watching this series, as well as Little House on the Prairie, from the critical perspective of an adult and educator.  The writing is very good -- unlike the crass and vulgar scripts of today.  You will find that you and your children can have rich discussions after each episode about character motivation, conflict archetypes, the technical issues pertaining to staging/videography, such as light, shadow, color, music, camera angle, etc.  You will be pleasantly surprised by what your children will teach you about these great series of a bygone era.",1389139200,,1458,4.918367346938775
1992630,5,B0001DMXEC,"Okay, I watched this series growing up.  I love my Walton's! My dream is to live on a farm in the country, and the scenery and people in this series make me wish I grew up with them all.",1389139200,,186,3.769230769230769

1992634,5,B0001DMXEC,The Walton's take you back to the time when TV entertainment was fun.  My husband and I enjoy watching an episode in the evening when it is time to relax and reminisce about the first time we saw these episodes and feel good feelings we get.,1387152000,,241,4.239130434782608

1992637,5,B0001DMXEC,"I love this series.  Never watched it continually when it was first on tv.  Each story is heartwarming and well done.  The cast is excellent.  Reminds me of my childhood.  I was born in 1937, a little later than John Boy, but still relate to the closeness of families and simple pleasures of those times.  I remember chasing lightning bugs also as a child in the summertime.  too bad there are no series like this now.  thankful that re-runs got me interested in seeing all of the series.",1386460800,,488,4.465909090909091
1992638,5,B0001DMXEC,"It is very nice to have the first series of The Waltons.  When we disconnected with cable tv and went with straight antenna, I had Walton withdrawals.

1992643,5,B0001DMXEC,"I was only a child when this series was a prime time TV staple. I recently was channel surfing and came across this show and decided to give it a look-at, and boy was I surprised. I've always been a history buff, especially with early American history and this series is filled with such historical content of the depression era in the United States of America. The stories of life in a small town in the Blue Ridge Mountains just seem to wrap around you like a warm blanket. It illustrates just how important family is and how happiness can be had with just the minimal.",1379289600,2,571,4.39622641509434

1992647,5,B0001DMXEC,I had actually purchased all the other seasons and the Walton movie package. The 1st season was the only one I needed to complete my collection.

1992649,5,B0001DMXEC,"The story lines are pointed, conveying issues of the day and even more modern ones. The acting and choice of actors blend well together. I can see why the Emmys were awarded. I missed the original viewing because of school/word load. Happy that the DVD sets are out for enjoyment. Well worth the money.

Is there any way we could get it in our language??,1370563200,,371,4.575757575757576
1992656,5,B0001DMXEC,"Getting back into those gentler days, Walton's Mountain doesn't seem to suffer from the depression as much as other folks. These programs showed a time when people helped each other. Papa Walton gave sage advice to his children, loved his wife and gave us all a good feeling that everything was going to turn out fine. And it always did.  I truly enjoy getting lost in this series. Ralph Waite as John Walton seems the true seasoned, simple folk kind of father, and Michael Learned as Liv Walton embraces her life with grace and heart. Season One gives viewers the boundless foundation to follow this family's plights through a difficult time of our country's history. The simple answers were not complicated. There isn't anything complicated about whether it is right or wrong. It is one or the other. John Walton told his children this truth. Liv Walton hugged and loved her children and was her husband's true partner. She showed her strengths and let the audience know that women have always had the ability to make good decisions with their lives. The Walton's directions were always on the right path. Everything was good, and kind, and loving. It's a great way to spend an evening watching this unfold.",1370131200,,1209,4.8125

It is the ideal and what it teaches are the things that matter and endure.  For those who foolishly think  that what one sees and reads doesn't realy affect one.... in the words of the actor who played the dad in the series, stated that haveing that role made him seek to be a better father to his own children.

As a family who watches this TV show together I sometimes am amazed at how something that seems so trivial as a television show from the 1970's can still have so much power today.

1992693,5,B0001DMXEC,"Back in the 1980s I discovered The Waltons while it was being rerun on Channel Four in the UK every Sunday lunchtime. The series was a real gem and even today nearly 40 years after this first series was made, the quality shines through.
Miss Michael Learned, Ralph Waite, Ellen Corby, Will Geer and Richard Thomas star as the main members of The Waltons clan experiencing a tough life in 1930's America. There are another six other regulars who make up the Waltons family.
Each episode centres around a different story and features different guest stars, many of whom were big names in the early 1970s. This powerful series would run until 1981 and then return as several one off movies.
Simple and moralistic, The Waltons is a far cry from the CGI infested programmes on our screens today. Scenes are longer than you will find on screen today as there is no desperation to hold the viewers attention in those days. The quality of the series itself was the magnet which drew viewers to the show.
I particularly love the episodes featuring the Baldwin sisters. Their father's ""Recipe"" and it's reactions around the Walton household still amuse me to this day. Helen Kleeb and Mary Jackson are superb as the elderly sisters.

If you like decent family drama, then this series is for you.

Enjoy!",1323820800,,1293,4.716814159292035
1992694,5,B0001DMXEC,Every once in a while television magic happens and that is what happened with THE WALTONS.  This is the first season of one of the best family dramas of all times.  The show is heartwarming and illustrates timeless messages like unconditional love and caring.  I grew up on this series and to think this season is almost 40 years old blows me away.  The casting is superb with standouts of course being Richard Thomas as John-Boy and Michael Learned as the mother Olivia.  Each episode stands the test of time and the video presentation here is superb.  The show looks and sounds great.  Five Emmy awards were won for this first season.  My favorite episode is the expanded special AN EASTER STORY where Olivia develops polio.  It touched me deeply when it aired originally and to now see it again it is just as emotional.  It is rare for a series to be able to present realistic heartfelt love and emotion episode after episode and THE WALTONS achieved that throughout its entire run.  Each character grew and went thru their trials and tribulations but the warmth and true feelings that held this show together still ring true just as strong as when first aired. I can't recommend this show and this season enough.,1320969600,,1216,4.661971830985915

I enjoyed Season One, disc 1-A without a hitch.  On side 1-B, the first story, The Hunt, is damaged.  It is almost as if someone was playing the role of censor.

At the moment the bear appears on the screen, digital blocks break up the picture and the next scene shows the Waltons around the table praising John-Boy for killing the bear.

The cast is great.  The principal characters all have the ability to carry the show and the younger children and anncilary characters all fit in well.  I enjoy the period costumes and the concerns families had during the depression.  Perhaps we can all relate to this situation now that we seem to be returning to depression level unemployment and anxiety.

Some of the epidsodes are a bit predictable, but this show is genrally well written and acted.  I recall as the series aged it reached its peak and then remained on air for a few more years.  This eventually leads to a poorer quality show as characters leave and newcomers don't seem to have the same charm as the original characters.

The overall vision of the episodes is a family that helps others, cares about others,serves and supports each other through difficult times as well as everyday matters. ""The Walton's"" is a role model of how we should be towards family members and members of the community as well as strangers.

1992746,5,B0001DMXEC,"Unless you get the family channel what seems to be missing from broadcast television these days,'Extreme Home Makeover' excepted is programming that teaches you how to be a better human being. These Walton episodes from the early 70's do just that. There are a few twilight scenes in the earliest episodes that are quite dark but other than that there ain't much to complain about in this 5 front and back dvd collection. John Ritter has an excellent guest appearance as a rookie fire and brimstone preacher who gets a huge dose of the Baldwin sisters' 'recipe' which later translates to a huge dose of humility. Miss Micheal Learned's Liv Walton comes down with polio in the 2 hour season finale which showcases some truly fine acting . Sissy Spacek gets a nice guest starring role as an unruly country vixen trying to get John Boy to become anti-John Boy. It doesn't work ! I would recommend this season whole heartedly to anyone. We all need a daily dose of the Waltons to make this world tolerable.",1185926400,3,1002,4.666666666666667

1992748,5,B0001DMXEC,"This was one of the shows we watched on Thursdays every week, in addition to Mary Tyler Moore, Bob Newhart, and Carol Burnett shows on Saturday nights.  I'll be honest, though.  Being hard of hearing myself which meant I couldn't easily understand the dialogues involved, I didn't really care much for this one.  I could see well, though, so the better whatever looked, the better I'd like whatever it is.  Thus, this show didn't quite win me over, at least not yet.  However, as I got older I'd get used to it, to the point I'd enjoy it somewhat.  Little House on the Pairie, apparently NBC's answer to this show, did win me over right away as the scenes involving the kids looked more colorful and interesting.  Anyway, not too long ago I'd note that TW seemed somewhat dull, but I know that's not the point.  The point of this series is to inspire, and it's better found in the lessons imparted by characters relevant to the episode than whatever meets the eye.  I'm glad to say this season is closed captioned, so those needing English assistance can benefit from it greatly.

1992750,5,B0001DMXEC,"With 21st century eyes, it's wonderful to see a family like the Waltons. Although they are scrabbling against poverty, living in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia during the Depression, they are happy. The large family, which includes seven children, parents, and grandparents, is loving and supportive. Sure, the kids aren't angels -- like any others, they squabble and have their problems. But when push comes to shove, they've got one another's backs, like when eldest sister Mary Ellen beats up a classmate for mocking little brother Jim Bob's shirt (made from sister Erin's old dress) or when eldest brother John-Boy defends Mary Ellen from a potential assault by a guest staying with the family.

Most gratifying is the children's overall contentment. Sure, they aspire for ""things"" - they long to see a traveling circus that comes to the mountains, and they pause by toys displayed in the general store. But for the most part, they don't dwell upon what they don't have. They take contentment in life in general, and when the occasional treat comes their way, they truly appreciate it...unlike many kids today, whose parents buy them the latest iPods and video games, and it's STILL not enough.

The Waltons' saga is told through the eyes of eldest son John-Boy, who is 17 and aspires to be a writer. He is based on Earl Hamner, a Virginia native who wrote ""Spencer's Mountain,"" the book upon which the show is based. Hamner does a voiceover in each episode, speaking as the adult John-Boy looking back on his childhood.

(For the record, I'm 26 years old, not someone who grew up with this show, or looks down upon ""today's youth"" from the vantage of age. But, as you know, not all young folks are content with the attitudes of today's society as a rule. I, for one, truly wish we could return to a simpler time; it won't be long before our complicated lives lead us to self-destruct.)",1174608000,8,1896,4.774390243902439

1992753,5,B0001DMXEC,"The year was 1972 when this show hit the airwave on CBS September 14 as a weekly series. The Waltons was based on a large close-knit family living in rural Virginia during the Depression. The Creator Earl Hamner Jr. based the series on his own childhood, which he previously fictionalized in his novel, ""Spencer's Mountain"". The Waltons debuted on with Richard Thomas playing the role of John Boy Walton. In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, during the Great Depression, the Walton family makes its small income from its saw mill on Walton's Mountain. The story is told through the eyes of John Boy, who wants to be a novelist, goes to college, and eventually fulfills his dream. The saga follows the family through depression and war, and through growing up, school, courtship, marriage, employment, birth, aging, illness and death. This is the true story of the Waltons. The show takes place during the Depression and then during World War II. The other case members were as followed Ralph Waite played the role of John Walton Sr. Michael Learned played the role Oliva Walton, Judy Norton Taylor played the role of Marry Ellen, Jon Walmsley played the role of Jason Walton, Mary Beth McDonough played the role of Erin Walton, Eric Scott played the role of Ben Walton, David Harper played the role of Jim Bob Walton, Kami Cotler played the role of Elizabeth Walton, Will Greer played the role Grandpa and Ellen Corby played the role of Grandma. Other original characters included Joe Conley as general store owner, Ike Godsey, John Crawford as Sheriff Ep Bridges, Mariclare Costello as schoolteacher Miss Rosemary Hunter and Helen Kleeb and Mary Jackson as eccentric sisters-- Mamie and Emily Baldwin, respectively. The Waltons' first season brought critical acclaim and several awards. Both Richard Thomas and Michael Learned took home Best Actor Emmys, Ellen Corby was awarded the Best Supporting Actress honor and the series was given the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. The show also earned Emmys for writing and editing in addition to receiving the prestigious Peabody award. The series entered the top-ten in its second season and finished second that year to All in the Family. The show remained in the top twenty for the next few seasons and received several more Emmys, including two more for both Michael Learned and Ellen Corby and a Best Supporting Actor award for Will Geer. In all, The Waltons received 37 Emmy nominations and took home 13 of the golden statuettes. Three reunion movies have been produced in the 1990s for CBS. ""A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion"" (1993), ""A Walton Wedding"" (1995) and ""A Walton Easter"" (1997) all feature the original cast with the exception of the late Will Geer. The series opened in the fall of September 1972 with the first episode titled The Foundling. A six-year old deaf and dumb girl is abandoned on the Walton's doorstep. With loving care they teach her to ""talk"" with sign language. But their kindness to the foundling causes a family crisis. Elizabeth, playing hide-and-seek with the deaf and dumb girl Holly, runs into an old abandoned shack and hides inside an empty trunk, but the lid falls shut and locks itself. Holly sees what has happened and runs to get help but is picked up by her father who doesn't understand sign language and takes her away. John and the family pursue and Holly then tells them by sign language what has occurred, and Elizabeth is rescued in time. Holly's parents now realize that their little girl is not retarded and are now able to communicate with her.",1172793600,6,3549,4.897009966777409

They have flaws which makes them more realistic. However, this family reminds me of my father's family who made ends meet during the Depression. The made over clothes, etc. are very realistic.

This is a wonderful change from the atrocious sitcoms on TV. Some of the episodes really shine. The Typewriter is one of my favorites. Also, the Courtship is wonderful. I am eager to view the second season.

I recommend the book, ""Goodnight John Boy"", which tells about Earl Hamner, the author  who created the Waltons. The Waltons are based on the Hamner family, who lived in Virginia.",1163980800,4,726,4.878048780487805

In today's world that makes the Waltons sound like fundamentalist christian republicans. Ok take me for example-- I'm a gay punk rocker/goth guy who works for a porn company-- and I LOVE this show. It brings back great memories from my childhood. I'd like to think that the Waltons' is not that out of touch with a family of today. The thing that made the show great was that it showed a family who faced struggles with dignity, and all the characters showed kindness toward each other... they faced hardships and persevered by helping each other & working hard, and not judging others. If that is ""out of touch"" with today's families then God help us all. I'm really sick of hearing people make fun of this show for what it was. Same thing with 'Leave it to Beaver'.

  Yes John-Boy Walton Earl Hamner described his family and childhood experiences in a positive way but he also knew that it was an uncommon life.

  The Waltons lived in a small town not too far from Charlottesville Va in the Blue Ridge mountains. The depression was raging around the nation even affecting rural areas. The family included his parents John and Olivia Walton ,Grandparents  Zeb and Esther Walton ,3 sisters Elizabeth ,Erin ,and the feisty Mary-Ellen and 3 brothers Ben ,Jason,and Jim-Bob.

  The lived on a small farm and also operated a sawmill. The only store in town was owned by lke Godsey a family friend .Almost everyone that lived in the town or visited  eventually came in contact with the Walton family .The were always treated with kindness and understanding .Johnboy knew the rest of the world was not quite as gererous and trusting and wanted to become a writer so he can communicate his feelings with the rest of the world about his family esp his parents.

  l guess he did a good job because the Walton are still one of the most popular and well known families in the world.

1992784,4,B0001DMXEC,"The WALTONS was a beloved family institution on television throughout the 70s. It was wholesome and entertaining television. It still is.

The first season is available on DVD and is a good value although without frills. There is nothing to speak of in the way of commentaries or interviews and the purchaser must put up with the hassle of two sided disks but they are worth the effort.

This set of the first season contains the following episodes:

The Foundling - The Walton family wakes up to find an unexpected gift lying on the doorstep. It is an abandoned little girl. She seems half starved and does not respond to much of anything except with fear. She is deaf. Though times are hard and the first inclination is to let her go to an orphanage, the family decides to take her in for a while. The mother of the child is hiding out, keeping an eye on things. The father has given an ultimatum to put the child in a home but the mother doesn't want to do it. He thinks she is mentally dumb. She doesn't believe it and wants to find a nice family for her to live with. Her time with the Waltons is well spent. John-boy manages to start teaching her some sign language and the child becomes very popular with all of the family except for Elizabeth who is jealous. All is made well when Elizabeth gets lost and the little foundling girl manages to save the day by telling them where she is.

The Carnival - The kids are excited about a carnival on Walton's Mountain but don't get to go because they can't afford it. The carnival breaks up when the manager runs off with the money and some of the carnies are stranded in the area. The Walton family offers some hospitality even though many are suspicious of them. The hospitality is repaid with kindness though the experience evokes a desire to travel in John-Boy.

The Calf - A calf is born to the Walton family but it is a bull calf instead of a heifer. That means it will produce no income for the family. The axel on the family truck has broken and they need the money from selling the calf to pay for the axel. Unfortunately, the kids have adopted the animal and it is like losing a family member.

The Hunt - John Boy is about to go on his first hunt with his father. He is nervous. He wants to do the ""manly"" thing and help provide for the table but the idea of killing bothers him.

The Typewriter - John-boy finally finishes writing a story and sends it off to Collier's Magazine to try and get it published.

The preacher manages to disrupt just about everyone's lives but learns something about life when he visits he cousins, the Baldwin sisters.

An accident involving John-boy and the son just further the impression. It is all a mistake. The Waltons don't know they are Jewish and they wouldn't care if they did know.

I remember hearing the comforting sounds of my neighborhood while they were preparing for summer - the mechanical whirring of a push lawn mower, the snipping of hedge trimmers, the tapping of a hammer repairing a piece of siding loosened during a winter storm.  Then, through the open window of my home, I hear the beginning strains of the Blue Ridge tune followed my by mom calling out, ""Girls, ""The Waltons"" is on.""  My sister and I raced for the best seat and we settled in for an hour of Earl Hamner's story.

The DVDs brought all that back to me; in a world so different from when I was a child, I love being able to watch something wholesome yet not naive.

1992789,5,B0001DMXEC,"We love the Waltons!  So many of the shows I grew up watching are so much better for kids than the current shows on TV.  I'm so glad the Waltons is available on DVD.  Our kids (ages 6 and 8) love watching it with us and the shows are very entertaining, but also full of good lessons and moral truth.

Although this shouldn't convince anyone not to buy the DVD, the quality could be better.  It looks just like it did on TV years ago - no better for being on DVD.  Still, definitely worth purchasing.

The first time we put it on our kids said it looked boring, and I guess it sort of does, compared with the flashy, bright, fast-paced shows on TV now.  We told them they had to watch it with us and there would be a quiz at the end.  Well, they were glued to the screen once the show got started, and at the end they insisted that I give them the quiz, so I did, just for fun.  Now if we say, ""We're watching the Waltons!"" they come running and still insist I give them a quiz after every episode.

Watching these shows together is a great way to spend time with your family!",1141862400,3,1075,4.04739336492891

The quality of the DVDs are dissapointing! Why not digitally remastered the episodes? Very poor DVDs in design, especially when you compair them to the ones of The Little House on the Prairie. No bloopers, no comments, no extras!

After about 3 weeks we are almost done with Season 1.  After one ends, the children, esp the older one, ask if they can watch another.  It is a wonderful show about a terrific family.

I hope a little more care will be taken with the future seasons.

BTW, the producers did neglect to make English subtitles available (who knows why), but by selecting cc on your television you can see the subtitles that are there in English! Why the producers didn't include this option with the DVD subtitle button is a pure mystery.

1992796,5,B0001DMXEC,"Other reviewers have thoroughly reviewed the details of the Waltons first year on TV with titles and plot descriptions, so I won't elaborate further.  Instead, I will tell you why I feel this DVD set is perhaps is the best series that ever aired on TV, and is true family entertainment.

The Waltons first aired in 1972 on CBS.  It was considered ""hokey"" by some of the critics of the day, yet it captured the hearts of the viewers and went on to be one of the finest long-running series on TV.  It captured peoples hearts because it told stories of real people, real people in a family that loved and cared for each other. Although many of the stories are of course fictional, the writer, Earl Hamner (who is actually John-boy), weaves fiction with real-life drama and shows how his loving family dealt with the hard times they grew up in, and how they related to each other with love.  In essence, the Waltons shows the viewer what all of us would like our families to be like. One cannot help caring about the characters because Hamner does such a great job of developing their unique personalities for us.  The actors and actresses that play his family are perfect for the parts, and even though many of them are just children, their realistic acting makes one believe they are actually a real family.  The series is carried on the shoulders of three central characters, John-Boy (Richard Thomas), his mother Olivia Walton (Michael Learned), and Father John Walton (played by Ralph Waite).  All three are absolutely superb in their respective roles, and earned honors and accolades for their depiction of Hamner's family.  When these three characters eventually left ths show in later years, the show itself folded.

If you have never seen The Waltons on TV, this is the place to start.  The first season is perhaps the best, with stories that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer.  I watch the shows with my own 6 children and even in these modern days with so many other distractions, my kids are thrilled with the stories.  Each child relates to a particular Walton child, and after finishing an episode, they beg to watch another.

Television does not get better than The Waltons.  I recommend this series for those viewers who desire more family values and less violence, sex, and questionable language and topics in their tv viewing.  This is true family values TV, and I wish we had something like it today.  The Waltons will capture your heart, and you will come to love the characters and care about them.  Thank you Earl Hamner for sharing your lovely family with us!

1992797,5,B0001DMXEC,"Nominated for 15 Golden Globes and 25 Emmys, including two for Outstanding Drama Series, The Waltons enjoyed nine seasons of high audience ratings and notable critical acclaim. Premiering on CBS in the Fall of 1972, the hour-long drama series chronicled the lives of a tightly-knit mountain family living during the Depression era. Creator Earl Hamner Jr. based The Waltons on his true-to-life story of growing up in the Hamner family. Noted for its family-oriented subject matter (and absence of torrid sex and violence), The Waltons paved the way for the success of the popular TV series Little House On The Prairie (1974). And, in the aftermath of the cancellation of The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) and Green Acres (1965), proved wrong the assertion of some CBS executives that shows with rural settings were becoming unpopular. Celebrated for its raw depiction of the human experience, The Waltons towers above modern day television dramas by laying claim to the added weight today's critics give to ""realism"" in a series while simultaneously avoiding the bad language, adult content, and gratuitous violence that often accompany those shows which earn such a designation...

The Waltons follows the daily lives of the various members of the Walton family as they make a living working their humble saw mill on Walton's Mountain in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Set in the 1930's, the series unfolds through the eyes of John Boy (Richard Thomas). An aspiring writer, John Boy chronicles life on Walton Mountain where his parents, John Sr. (Ralph Waite) and Olivia (Michael Learned), raise their seven children (John Boy, Jason, Mary Ellen, Erin, Ben, Jim-Bob, and Elizabeth) with the aid of live-in grandparents Esther (Ellen Corby) and Zeb (Will Greer) Walton. A wide array of supporting characters live near the Waltons, including Reverend Fordwick (portrayed by Three's Company star John Ritter), the Godseys, the Baldwins, and various others. As the trials of the Great Depression fade into the tribulations of World War II, the Waltons connect with every facet of the human experience - love, marriage, birth, death, aging, social ills, and the numerous travails of life, making The Waltons one of the most popular shows in television history...

The Waltons (Season 1) DVD features a number of memorable episodes including the series premiere ""The Foundling"" in which a young girl named Holly is left on the doorstep of the Walton family. Following a checkup with the family pediatrician, they learn that Holly is deaf. John Boy takes the initiative and teaches Holly a form of sign language so the two can communicate, a skill which proves to be quite important when Holly warns the family that its youngest member is in urgent danger... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Literary Man"" in which John Boy meets noted author A.J. Covington when the truck breaks down, and ""The Courtship"" in which Olivia's Uncle Cody falls in love with a four-time divorcee when he comes to visit the family...

These stories, meticulously written and lovingly acted by a memorable cast of players, take us to the brink of sentiment but always manage to teach us wonderful lessons about growing up, generosity, kindness, and what it means to be a family and to be alive. My 11-year-old son and I watch an episode a night. He's learned the names of all the family members. It's good to know that nothing cynical or nasty will be appearing on this show as he watches it, and that he will come away with things to think about. There is an open-hearted and nonjudgmental generosity that circles this show, always open to new ideas and new people. Richard Thomas (John-Boy) possesses a wide-eyed wonder and a love of literature that is amazingly refreshing. And his father, John, and mother, Livia, listen to their children and give them the emotional room to grow. What a beautiful gift they've given them. Earl Hamner's narrative voice grounds us in a world of certain love even amidst economic and political chaos.

It has often amused me that the biggest detractors of this show almost never have actually watched it. My mother, who never watched it once, has always said,""Ugh! The Waltons. A bunch of goody-two-shoes and that stupid John Boy and that ugly thing on his cheek."" I was privately amused when my son, whose name is John (after a grandfather, not John Boy)actually was born with a small mole on his left cheek so his Gramma had to ""shut up"" about it!(unlike Richard Thomas, my son plans to have his removed when he is fully grown!)Anyway, many of the best life lessons my husband and I have tried to model and impart to our kids have been backed up by issues on the show! I can hardly wait for the Second Season.

1992807,5,B0001DMXEC,"I don't think you can get more wholesome than The Waltons.  It was a true family show.  Everyone from baby to great great grandma sat down to watch it.  Told through the remembreances of John Walton Jr. nicknamed Johnboy (Ricahrd Thomas) we discovered what it was like to live on Walton's Mountain during the depression.  Times were hard but there was still fun to be had.  No doubt some folks will be reminded of their own lives when the world was much simpler and less wicked.  I am always reminded of my own passion for writing when John boy sits at his desk to write about everything he sees.

Near the end of its run there are cast members who decide to leave the show.  Micheal Learned and Richard Thomas both left and the series did suffer from the loss although it went on for a good while without them.  Once they brought in someone to play an aunt who basically replaces the mother figure, the shows fate was sealed.

During the first season, it is comforting to watch all of the cast find the right niche for their characters and become a complete family unit.  After awhile, the country accents become less forced and more natural.  Everyone eases into their roles and becomes quite comfy.

Please treat your family to this dvd.  There is no nudity,  profanity or sexual situations.  There may be some mild violence.  In general this dvd is kid friendly.",1099612800,12,1366,4.532786885245901
1992808,5,B0001DMXEC,"I am so glad they finally decided to put The Waltons on DVD!  The is a excellent boxset.  I thought the picture and sound quality was great.  I wish there were some commentaries from Earl Hamner or the cast, but there's still 8 seasons to go. Maybe we'll get some commentaries or even a few bloopers in the next few boxsets--when/if they'll be released.

In answer to Matt Weaver's question about the two-hour episode about Grandpa Walton's death, that episode was called ""The Empty Nest.""  It is the one where they all go up to Waltons Mountain to say goodbye to their grandfather (Actor Will Geer died in April 1978).  This episode is not on VHS or DVD, but The Waltons are showing on the Hallmark Channel now.  Once they reach Season 7, (they're on Season 1 now), you'll get to see that episode.  It is a tear-jerker.

I've been a Waltons fan for two years now.  I'm only 26 and they're aren't many fans of The Waltons who are around my age.  I can't stand what's on TV today.

1992813,5,B0001DMXEC,"Wow.  This brings back memories of Thursday nights, eating popcorn and watching The Waltons with my family. Sentiment and nostalgia are not necessarily bad things.  I'm too young to remember the first few seasons, but these characters are imbedded in my imagination and memory almost as much as other, bigger pop culture phenomena of my childhood in the 70s such as Star Wars.  I've always liked The Waltons, and would never have dismissed it as sappy or maudlin, but I didn't realize that I'd enjoy it as much as I have after watching this DVD set of the first season.  Before getting this set for my birthday, my wife and I were talking about how we missed having a series that the whole family could watch- we have our adult shows and the kids have their shows on Nick and Disney, but there's no middle ground for all of us to enjoy.  So I received The Waltons for my birthday, and we've been enjoying it for the past few months watching one or two episodes a week.

The show, as I said, is as good as I remember it.  The characters seem very realistic to me- they're attrative but not terribly glamorous, and they're simple and decent people but not simplistic or self-righteous.  The first season is a bit rough around the edges, and the characters of the individual children (all seven of them) take a while to completely take shape.  But you can see the beginnings of personalities and storylines and quirks that remain throughout much of the show.  Will Geer as ""The Grandfather"" is particularly memorable- what a fine actor and character, and what a loss when he passed away later on in the shows run.  And if you were used to later seasons of the show, you also tend to forget what a central role Richard Thomas played as John Boy and what a good, likable actor he is (why they brought him back with another actor in the last few seasons is difficult to understand, but you don't need to dwell on that in the early seasons).  Many of the neighbors and friends are here in their wonderful supporting roles:  Ike (Corabeth comes to Walton's Mountain a few seasons later), the Baldwin Sisters and the Recipe, Rev. Fordwick (a very young John Ritter) and Yancy Tucker.  The credits are a bit different- rather than the famous sepia-toned portraits of the characters, there's a scene of the family gathered on the porch with their new radio, and the familiar theme song is a bit more subdued.  But Earl Hamner's wonderful, almost poetic narration was there from the beginning, as are the famous ""Goodnights"" at the end of each episode.  So while I hope to see more seasons released on DVD, Season 1 is certainly a worthy beginning to this wonderful show.

And again, don't be mislead by the many parodies and derisions of this show.  As warm and family-friendly as it can be, The Waltons often has a dark, melancholy edge to it.  Maybe Depression-era povery in rural Virginia wasn't quite as it's depicted on The Waltons, but there is plenty of suffering and hardship present that makes these stories realistic and relevant without going over-the-top in a ""Little House"" sort of way.  You get the sense that this is a real family that loved and lost through a crucial period in American history- the Depression and later World War II, both of which loom heavily over the entire series and drive many of the storylines.  I actually remember The Waltons as playing a significant role in my interest in history. The show was very good at driving home a lesson without being moralistic or preachy.  The writers and actors were able to convey a loving and decent family and community, while still giving them flaws that made them believable and empathetic. Still, despite the sometimes sobering elements, it's a wonderful show to share with children, who will hopefully learn to know the characters as much as we did when the show was first run.  As much as I love The Sopranos and 24 and NYPD Blue and any number of contemporary shows, it's nice to have something with substance and meaning to experience with the whole family.  Let's just hope that they don't stop with the first season...",1096416000,16,4091,4.634349030470914
1992814,5,B0001DMXEC,"I admit that I am an unabiased fan of The Waltons.  Every since I saw ""The Homecoming"" on its first broadcast at Christmas of 1971, I have been enthralled by this show.

When the Family Channel started to broadcast the reruns in the early 1990's it afforded me the opportunity to sit and watch it with my sons every night.

I purchased the DVD when it was released but just got the time to actually sit down and watch them.  I had intended to watch 1 a night but found that I watched 2 or 3 a night.

There are several standout episodes contained in the first year (The Scholar deserved every award it received) but the real magic in watching these episodes is the growth of the characters and the inherent decency of the family.  I don't want to single anyone out as it would not be fair.  Richard Thomas is the star and his portrayal of John Boy is one of the classic television perfomances.  The way the cast knits together is every bit a tribute to the close knitting of the Walton clan.

Admittedly you are looking at the beginnings of a show that you know very well, but the roots were as strong as those in that mountain.

I only hope that someone has the brains to continue to issue each season at least through Richard Thomas' exit full time from the series.

Too often we get year one (Larry Sanders) and nothing more.  This series deserves to be seen by everyone.

It is hard to believe that it will be 33 years this year that we first met these characters.  They will still be as good 33 years from now.",1096329600,12,1515,4.270175438596492
1992815,5,B0001DMXEC,"I've always liked this show! Believe it or not, watching this show as a kid in the early to mid '70's in rural Western Pennsylvania, with strict parents (""You're not getting any supper until that garden's wed!"" ""Did you go into the woods without asking? Get up the steps and get ready for a lickin'."" ""You said NO?!""...you can imagine what happened on that one) who were born in the '20s and grew up in the depression, was interesting because I could identify with the characters. It was also interesting to hear mom and dad make comparisons to the way the Waltons lived. They said that the Waltons had it good! They had electric, meat, sugar...these were luxuries at that time. In a way, it was silly to compare real life to Hollywood scripts, but watching this show always made them remember that era and always resulted in some interesting story telling.
  But aside from all of that, it's really nice to have the first season of the Waltons on DVD. I think the quality is very good. The sound is also very good. It's a relief to hear some reviewers talk about the present state of television. I thought I was all alone in my assessment. I can think of so many shows I would love to see come out on DVD, but for the most part what's offered? CSI, Friends, Married...With Children, Sex and the City. CRAP!!! COMPLETE GARBAGE! They're not worth the effort it takes to develop them, let alone produce them! Thank goodness we're getting the occasional great releases like this set. We're enjoying the snot out of it!",1095638400,15,1515,4.545787545787546

We watched the Waltons here on a Sunday just after lunch, I can smell the dinner cooking with every episode I watched, I remember being ribbed by my brothers on how could you watch that, but the escape it gave me then has come back, they bring back so many happy memories, I cannot wait for series two to come out, I don't want to finish watching series one and then have to wait.  I bought the book as well and am reading the memories of each episode as I watch them, double pleasure.  Well worth the money and the chance to re-live my past.

But getting ahold of myself, I just have to tell all of you potential buyers that even though this set is a wonderful set to get, I am thoroughly and extremely disappointed that these have NOT been restored! If you pay attention to the stories themselves, you will have an enjoyable experience, but be warned--it is like watching them directly from network TV! There are several that are VERY CHOPPY!",1090713600,6,469,4.662650602409639
1992819,5,B0001DMXEC,"Season 1 was the best season for this show. I hardly remember what it was that compelled me to watch this show when it first aired, and now I remember: The acting, the stories, and the messages were darned good for a TV show.
The kids were cute, the grandparents were fiesty, John-Boy's role was binding and strong, and mom and dad were strong-willed and loving. Remember ""Livvy's"" sense of morals and ethics? We need more people like her nowadays.
The quality of the video is pristine, as is the audio. It is such a joy seeing this series again in all its splendid glory. I remember loving the theme song, and holding a tape-recorder's hand-mike to the TV speaker, just to record that song.
I'm not sure that I'd buy later seasons (if they are released), as the show got progressively weaker and weaker as the kids grew older and lost their charm, and the stories became trite and silly.
But this DVD set is well worth the price.",1088812800,9,930,4.476470588235294
1992820,5,B0001DMXEC,"I am so pleased to be able to find this dvd set for my family.  It is so wholesome and full of good family life values.  The family members love and care for each other and set good examples of how to do that for its viewers.  Nothing can compare except a lot of the ""old stuff"".  We can't wait for the next season to be available.",1088121600,9,331,3.8955223880597014
1992821,5,B0001DMXEC,"I virtually grew up on shows like The Waltons & House on the Prairie, so when I found the Waltons on the DVD shelf in Wal-Mart, I just had to pick it up. Sure, I had just about all of the episodes on video...which as I look at them on the shelf, consists of 4 very high stacks of tapes, with some episodeic cavidies, low grade copies and some edit mistakes by the television stations when they re-aired them recently. I was reluctant when I picked up the copy, not sure if they would be of a poor grade or not...but when I got them home...not only were they the full length versions (50 minutes in comparison to the 40 - 45 minutes...depending on the stations) but they came up crystal clear in both picture and sound.
And I agree that the kids of today can still learn a few things from these episodes, while the adults can be equally as entertained and educated.
Of course these weren't meant to have an educational value to them, but they have dealt with a lot of issues like dealing with those who are different, substance abuse and even relationships of one form or another, while still sticking to the eras that the show was to take place (going from the depression, to WWII to the progression years 1950's in the follow-up movies).
While it is a long series to follow, it is well worth the investment. But I do agree with one person, if you shop around, you can find it cheaper than the price here...",1086307200,6,1407,4.333333333333333
1992822,4,B0001DMXEC,"This is a great series to watch. The only reason I didn't give it a fifth star, is that the dvd does not have any extras that you expect from a dvd. It would have been nice to see, different languages, outtakes, commentaries and biogrphies of the actors, and commentaries and biographies of the real family that this series is roughly based on by Earl Hamner. But I still highly recommend this dvd for quality TV watching. Lets hope that when they release season two, they will inclde more extras.",1086048000,8,497,4.533333333333333
1992823,5,B0001DMXEC,"This was a great series!
Some saw the Waltons as too ""goody too shoes"".  I disagree. The acting was good and it is excellent family programming.
Kids can learn a lot from this show, a lot of lessons about character and staring adversity in the face and overcoming it.",1085788800,6,267,4.448979591836735
1992824,2,B0001DMXEC,"The menu and extras that one wants in a DVD, are sadly absent from this set.  There are no narrations, no out-takes, and VERY oddly, no English Subtitling !!!!
This is particularly unbelievably for its utter hypocrisy, since the very first episode of this TV series focuses on the plight of a deaf child, and shows all the Waltons learning the basics of sign language in order to communicate with the deaf child.
Good grief !
On another score, the series is not quite as deep and charming as I'd remembered from my youth.  However, I was saddened to see that the bible-pounding that escaped my attention then, is painfully evident this time around.  Happily, it's not NEARLY as offensive as the bible-pounding in (say) Little House on the Prairie or Anne of Green Gables (where bad characters tend to have Jewish names, all good things are attributed to religion, and all bad things are blamed on a lack of Christianity).  But..there's enough bible-talk around the edges, to put a slight sourness on the series.",1085616000,7,1011,4.76
1992825,5,B0001DMXEC,"I confess that I once told a friend I could not go out to play because I didn't want to miss the Waltons! Today, just as yesterday, its message of faith, tolerance, courage and ""Do unto others..."" (in the midst of life's tests and trials)is sorely needed. In fact, the message is potentially more impacting today than it has ever been.
It is heartening to know that parents are sharing this series  with their children who, otherwise, might never have the chance to be acquainted with classic television drama. Schools should consider using this series as a means of inculcating ethics...why not start early with elementary school children, who are desperately in need of moral guidance, and who also need to be shown state-of-the-art actors (real masters of their craft, whose acting elevates the art of living), instead of the unseasoned ""professionals"" whose cheap, trite displays leave youngsters confused and questioning whether modern life is at all civilized and worth the effort. Why should poor role models dominate the media sphere which these children daily inhabit, when we all recognize there are far better alternatives?  If children live what they learn, then The Waltons should be learning for life. A period drama, too,  with scores of historic and literary allusions...wonderfully authentic;stunningly photographed;acted with such refinement.",1085616000,10,1360,5.316279069767442
1992826,5,B0001DMXEC,Absolutely without a doubt one of my favorite TV Shows.  The storylines are rich with quality and substance lacking in many shows.  The Season One DVD sets are heaven sent.

1992827,5,B0001DMXEC,"I was thrilled that Amazon is making this collection available.  It is very expensive to purchase the series through Columbia House. I think that it is approximately $ 25.00 per video/2 episodes on each tape on Columbia House.  The entire Columbia House series runs about $900.00 and takes a few years to complete (1 tape shipped per month).
The DVD collection also allows children to watch the programs in order.  My young kids could not follow the Hallmark shows until they learned the characters from the first season.
The show itself is fantastic.  There are so many important values incorporated in the text.  The emphasis on honor, responsibility, filial respect, the importance of instilling a work ethic, kindness, manners, respect fot the elderly, etc.  The list goes on.  It is a stepping stone for great conversations.  The quaintness of a simple life, the presence of a large family and the constant reference to nature intrigue kids.",1085097600,6,946,5.019230769230769
1992828,4,B0001DMXEC,"This is one show that I have many pleasant memories of.  As a teen, my family would gather around the tv on Thursday evenings to watch the day to day adventures of the Walton clan.  It touched my father because he was from the mountainous area of eastern Kentucky and he was born in 1932.  The whole show was almost like going home each week for him.  I felt our family got to know a little more about what his childhood was like by watching this show.
My parents were down this weekend and I rec'd the first season, so just like we did 30 some odd years ago, we gathered around the tv and enjoyed the first three episodes.  I was tickled to see how good the picture was and was also impressed with the audio.  This set has brought back so many pleasant memories of gathering around the tv mirroring the Waltons gathered around the radio.
I am so glad Warner's has provided us with this fine family show on dvd.  Now if they can just find some extra's for the next set.",1084752000,6,969,4.205405405405405
1992829,5,B0001DMXEC,"Nowhere near as maudlin or tragic as the show it is often (and unfairly) compared to, Little House on the Prairie, The Walton's is probably the best family TV drama of all time. Revisiting Walton's Mountain can bring back some great memories.  For those who stuck with the show throughout the run and watched in dismay as Richard Thomas, Will Geer, Ellen Corby, Michael Learned and finally Ralph Waite drifted away, the first season has everybody in fine form. The kids are cute without being saccharine, the stories are a fine balance of drama and humor and the acting and pacing are well done. This show may seem too slow to some, but life on the Mountain was leisurely, so the show should be also.
There are some complaints that despite the narration at the beginning of the episode telling us how isolated they were that a lot of people seemed to stumble upon that mountain: well, this is certainly true. I think the strongest episodes were those that took place within the community, and not with outsiders who always found a lesson to be learned from the Waltons.
As the first season progresses, each child gains their personality.  Jon Walmsley, my favorite, is also a very talented musician and his character Jason, the second oldest, is a good counterpoint to Richard Thomas' often cranky and annoyed John Boy.
This is a good place to start if you've never seen the show.  For those of us who grew up with it, or became converts in reruns, it's a blessed DVD event. Best episodes: The Scholar, The Typewriter and An Easter Story.",1084492800,25,1538,4.667896678966789
