8394885,3,B003DQSID4,"Icy Killers was an interesting video and did provide information but I would have liked to see mone information about the sharks physiology.  Living in Alaska I know how cold the water is and the fact that a shark can survive is amazing, but how.  The video touched on this but more would have made the video better.",1436054400,,316,4.431034482758621

8394888,2,B003DQSID4,"I was very disappointed in this video.  I expected more documentary on the salmon shark.  Instead, this video talked about jellyfish, sea otters, humpback whales, bears, glaciers, and eagles, even showing the humpback whales doing the bubble circle.  Many of the shark scenes were repeated numerous times.  I think I'm being generous saying 10% of this was about salmon shark.  Great Alaskan wildlife documentary, not much salmon shark.",1332288000,10,436,5.352941176470588
