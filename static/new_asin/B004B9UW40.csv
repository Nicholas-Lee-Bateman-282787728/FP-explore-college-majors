Michelle will take you from the basics to the advanced level all in the comfort of your own home.  Her intimate style of teaching is fun and so easy to follow.  Michelle breaks down each move all the while stressing the importance of proper body mechanics.  She also incorporates all the moves you have just learned in her mesmerizing performances.  Study with these and you will have the confidence it takes to dance for family and friends or even on the stage!  At times life gets in the way of fun, however, with Joyous Laughter I know that I can shimmy my way to a healthier body and mind!  Namaste Michelle!",1301788800,2,751,4.398550724637682

This is also a great work out and targets all those areas that we women seem to struggle with. Just beautiful performances to inspire learning. I have the set of 3 from basic to advanced and cannot say enough about taking them on travel with me or using them at home and getting a fast, fun, and effective workout and mental break. Great job Michelle! your videos are the best!",1292889600,,507,4.582417582417582
