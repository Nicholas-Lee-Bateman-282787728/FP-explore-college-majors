4460926,4,B004RPQSTG,"I agree with the previous raters. This is a good, authentic looking film. Generally I do not like older films related to fights with indians, because quite often indians are savage enemies. They sure were that from the pont of the whites, but I always remember the great injustices they have experienced. Often I hope they win. Here they are nameless adversaries, but one accepts it here. Surely the cavarly felt that way and fighting was their job. The soldiers are common people and not ordinary heroes. The indians are much more heroic. McCrea is excellent in his hard, indian-hating role. Other actors are good, too. This film was made in beautiful, natural mountain areas, which is an added bonus. This is nearly five star film.",1313539200,7,733,4.825396825396825

4460928,4,B004RPQSTG,"United Artists Corporation presents ""FORT MASSACRE"" (1958) (80 min/Color) -- Starring Joel McCrea, Forrest Tucker, Susan Cabot, John Russell, Anthony Caruso & Francis McDonald

Directed by Joseph M. Newman

The embittered cavalry Sergeant Vinson (Joel McCrea) must take over his regiment after their commanding officer is killed during an ambush. To save them, he leads the troop through Apache territory because it is the quickest way to reach the fort. The members of the regiment do not trust their new leader's reasoning. They suspect he is taking them through the restricted territory so that he can get revenge upon the Apaches who killed his wife and children several years before. The troop find themselves suffering a series of increasingly deadly attacks. Many die, until the soldiers, believe that the sergeant has lost his mind.

The real star is the cinematography, shot in beautiful color and featuring some of the best scenery outside a John Ford western.

Joel McCrea, John Russell and Forrest Tucker give good performances in this story about a cavalry troop on the move, constantly under attack.

There's no humor or sentimentality in this film. The interplay between McCrea, Tucker, and Caruso is interesting and incisive. McCrea shows how a miscreant within a unit can be as great a menace as the enemy. The cinematography is excellent, particularly during riding and water hole sequences.

Worth a look for those interested in the cavalry, plus the many Joel McCrea and John Russell fans.

4460929,4,B004RPQSTG,"Joel McCrea stars as tough US Cavalry Sergeant Vinson, who has to take command of C Troop when the senior officers are killed during an Apache attack. But what drives Vinson on? And is he the right man to lead the remaining members of the Troop? Directed by Joseph Newman, the films photography comes from Carl Guthrie, screenplay is courtesy of Martin Goldsmith, it's filmed in CinemaScope with De Luxe colour and the co-star list contains Forrest Tucker, John Russell, George N. Neise & Susan Cabot.

A moody and tough psychological Western that showcases the truly good side of the ""B"" Western splinter. Thematically strong with its anti-racist core, and really tightly written by Goldsmith, it's also notable for containing a wonderful performance from McCrea. Tho his Western output was very hit and miss {the brilliant Peckinpah film Ride The High Country was to come 4 years later} McCrea was always value for money in even the tardiest of Oaters. Here he gets to really grizzle for all his worth, his Vinson is a bitter man, blinded by hate, yet still capable of softening up if engaged in the right conversation. McCrea is first rate in the role, never over doing the hard-nosed side of the character and garnering believable sympathy when his guard is down.

More known for being the director of This Island Earth, Joseph Newman is hardly the name one links to the direction of a psychological Western. Yet he does a surprisingly good job with the action sequences and rightly lets his actors just tell the story. There's a small complaint that the final battle is all too brief, but that's a touch offset by a hillside C Troop/Apache battle that takes place in the first third of the film. Briskly constructed and with no saggy male posturing to weigh it down, the battle shows Newman to be quite adept at crafting a good old fashioned fight to the death between two very old fashioned foes. The film also looks terrific. Tho sadly not having a widespread DVD release and therefore not getting a remastered work over, the current print of the film available to television networks and Region 1 DVD is still a treat in this High Definition age. Where once the print was apparently murky, you now should be able to adjust and reap the benefit of what is on offer. Filmed at three locations, Gallup-New Mexico, Red Rock State Park-New Mexico & Kanab-Utah, Carl Guthrie's photography really utilises these locations, one moment it be a beautiful sprawling landscape, the next the rocks are enveloping the characters to portray the tension and confinement of their emotional and physical journey. All given the De Luxe sheen as the browns, reds and uniform blues come vividly to life.

Fort Massacre is little known and certainly under seen, thus its reputation has been founded by the casual Western viewer entering into it unaware of what type of character driven film it is. It's hoped that it can now find a newer and more appreciative audience because it's one of the better B Westerns of the late 1950s. 8/10",1301270400,32,3020,4.792706333973128
8439102,3,B004RPQSTG,Joel McCrea plays an Indian hating sergeant who takes command of the leftovers of a company that is destroyed by Apaches and tries to lead them back to the fort. The tactics employees against the Apaches are pretty bad. I'm pretty sure the Apaches would have wiped his little band of soldiers out if it had been tried in real life. I think it's supposed to be some kind of observations on how hate can come to cause want to make bad decisions but the movie is not good enough to do that,1503705600,,486,4.236559139784946
8439103,2,B004RPQSTG,McCrea not playing his typical affable good guy. He's out for revenge against the Indians and get his troop killed in the process. This is really a pretty dark movie and I can't say I enjoyed it very much. I collect westerns and this one ended up in my recycle pile.,1487635200,,266,4.235294117647059
8439104,4,B004RPQSTG,"Joel McCrea stars as a US Calvary Sergeant in charge of a team of military members. After their troop's officers get killed in fighting with the Apache's in New Mexico, he must lead the team that is left of the ""column"" to Fort Craig.
However, the Sergeant has personal issues that he has carried with him in his career and he risks the other members lives trying to survive and get back to the Fort.

Kino Lorber has done a great job on this Bluray Edition. There are 3 Theatrical Trailers, two with Joel McCrea, one with Robert Mitchum.
However, on one of the ""Trailers"", the one starring Robert Mitchum, the audio from ""Man Of the West"" trailer is dubbed over both! How that happened I don't know, but Kino Lorber has had issues with a select few of their Bluray titles concerning ""Audio Sync"" problems.

This movie, however, is intact and there are no issues with audio or the film itself. It does look it's best over previous releases.

8439107,4,B004RPQSTG,"There is a lot to like about FORT MASSACRE, a 1958 Western from director Joseph M. Newman that has a plot akin to THE LOST PATROL.

Joel McCrea stars as a cavalry sergeant, forced to lead his dwindling troop of men across the barren wilderness after a devastating attack by the Apaches that killed all the officers on the patrol.  McCrea, however, has a problem.  Because they wiped out his family, he hates the Apache so much that he is willing to risk the lives of his men in order to get his revenge against the tribe.

FORT MASSACRE has a good basic story, a couple of well-staged action sequences and many stunning shots of the New Mexico landscape, but the screenplay itself is riddled with awkward dialogue and many of the roles, though played by competent actors, are really miscast.  That includes McCrea, whose complex role might have been better served by a more introspective actor, such as Henry Fonda or somebody of that ilk.

Of course, FORT MASSACRE was not a huge budget picture, so an actor of Fondas stature might have been out of the producers price range.

Nevertheless, despite its problems, FORT MASSACRE will please fans of the Western genre, and the new Blu-ray from Kino Lorber delivers an excellent presentation of the Deluxe Color film.

Forrest Tucker, as well as two of my former publicity clients, John Russell and Susan Cabot, co-star in the picture.
