6272825,5,B00IKM5L6I,"Maybe its because its a psycho-thriller, and you have to have some semblance of thought and imagination, that made people rate this low but the acting was really good along with the story line. No need for a macabre, blood and gore filled 1.5 hours to keep your attention the actors were believable.  I gave it a five because it did what most films cannot less the nudity and violence. If that's your thing this is not for you but if you enjoy a film suitable for all this is it.",1403049600,20,479,4.263736263736264

Still good though as I liked the story and obviously Whitaker. Fan of Lathan and Epps.

I am really tired of paying fir movies that are constantly loading. So from here on out, I will go through Blockbuster ir Vudo. I think Amazon needs to look at what others are doing if they want to keep this business. The movie so far is great. Just loading.

6272832,4,B00IKM5L6I,"***CONTAINS MIDPOINT PLOT SPOILER***

Tommy (Anthony Macke) has an NDE (near death experience) in the first scene and becomes an author and ""life coach."" He has a beautiful wife (Sanaa Lathan) and an older brother who just got out of prison (Mike Epps). Angel (Forest Whitaker) takes Lithium and has visions of his dead mother. He hires Tommy to be his life coach to help him out which eventually becomes ""Misery.""  The film goes full circle as the therapist gets therapy.

I liked the basic plot outline, I wasn't thrilled with the execution. I kept imagining how much better this film would have been with Samuel L. Jackson as the antagonist. Forest needed to look more bipolar.  I found myself waiting for the movie to pick up and once it did, it changed the direction of the film which caught me off guard.

Will work as a rental.

6273006,3,B00IKM5L6I,"Overall, this movie has a good theme. For those of us who believe in karma (or an equivalent) know that evil deeds do not go unpunished. The protagonist and co-protagonist have to face this unfortunate truth. I'm not going to summarize the movie, but I will make some personal comments:
(1) The acting in this movie is a little above average for the majority of the movie. During some scenes, however, the acting is a little dramatic or novice at best. Forest Whitaker is a good actor when he is playing a role that fits him. He cannot play just any role. However, in this movie the role he played fit him pretty good.
(2) The supporting actors in this movie did not seem to fit well with the type of movie. For example, Mike Epps playing a serious role just does not fit. Although Mike Epps is a good actor when he is in a comic role, the dramatic setting of this movie just made him seem a little uncomfortable in this movie.",1468454400,,927,4.333333333333333

6273008,2,B00IKM5L6I,"We doubt Forest Whitaker is capable of turning in a bad performance and this film is no exception.  However even Whitaker can't completely overcome the deficiencies in the script that don't ever allow us to understand or relate to his character.  The conclusion (which doesn't make much sense and which we can't reveal here) simply isn't consistent with the character that has been developed over the course of the movie.

Otherwise, this indy thriller generally looks good and, as we'd expect, is quite slow paced.",1468195200,,515,5.035294117647059

6273697,4,B00IKM5L6I,"I really enjoyed this movie though I was able to figure out, from the moment Forest Whitaker came into play, that he was somehow related to the accident at the beginning of the movie. As soon as he mentioned his mom's death, I was sure she was the one in the beginning and the movie became more interesting because I started wondering what was going to be his next move. I understand that Angel was seeking justice for his mom but the way that happened was a little bit too much. Plus Tommy wasn't really guilty here, Ben was. Though Tommy was the one driving, Ben committed the crime while Tommy was shocked and couldn't do anything about it. Yes he could have said something about it later but if he had, the plot would have been different. In my opinion,  Ben should have been the one going thru all of this revenge.",1461283200,,819,4.352941176470588

6274426,2,B00IKM5L6I,"This was dark as heck. The mood changes so abruptly in this movie that you ride the fence the whole movie. For Forest Whittaker, this was practically his mad killer persona of acting, which was terrifying yet appreciable. And I appreciated Anthony Mackie taking a role where I don't enjoy him as the Falcon. This movie is all about a lie that caused everything to occur for the worst and for an enjoyable Friday night film, this is anything but that. It sort of had a feel of ""What About Bob?"" in the beginning but slowly turned into ""Misery"" and then makes you just feel a pit of crap. The question being asked is, is this man's craziness for a good purpose? Premise: Patient gets help by doctor who wrote book, doc wants to quit, doc tortured, you cheer for no one.

Conclusion: For a date night movie, don't watch this. If you're by yourself, don't watch this. If you're bored, don't watch this. To appreciate acting, watch this. And if you want to feel good, don't watch this. On that note, time to watch an animated kids movie to balance out the crap you feel after watching this. The end",1449792000,,1093,4.437810945273632

Forest Whitaker is not special in this film.  As in other roles, he's good at playing characters who are disturbed and/or deranged, here for mental-health and medication reasons.  The supporting cast is merely so-so.  So, the movie as a whole is ultimately neither unique nor compelling.

An alert: The movie is grizzly, which is a definite minus for those who tend to get queasy at the sight of enhanced interrogation, but a possible plus for others who appreciate thinking outside-the-box with regard to uses for power tools.",1434412800,,669,4.981981981981982

The ending was so aggravating. Mike Epps was trying too hard. No matter how serious he tried to be, I couldn't take him at face value. All I saw a comedian trying to hard to cross over.

6277253,3,B00IKM5L6I,This movie showed how a mentally deranged man ruined the lives of a young couple.  The man of the couple was only trying to help him and he accused him of making his wife leave him.  There is already too much of this in real life and movies shouldn't be made like this because I believe it leads to more deranged actions by people already having problems dealing with life.,1426636800,,373,4.314285714285714

6277321,3,B00IKM5L6I,"""Psychological Thrillers"" are not my favorite genre and at least this was not as difficult to view as Misery (if you've ever seen that movie). The acting was okay and the story moved along pretty well. The movie is short (1.5 hours I think), which is good for one who only moderately cares to see these kinds of movies. There were a few places where we fast forwarded to skip some of the shock value of the more intense scenes. I like Forest Whitaker and watched the movie based on him starring in the movie. He did his usual good job of acting and he was convincing in his part. If  you like psychological thrillers, you will probably like this movie. If you are sensitive to these kinds of things, which maybe we all should be(!), then you may want to skip it!",1426636800,,762,4.328671328671328

I got through about half of the movie and then had to stop watching. Some B flicks hold my attention, some don't, and this one did not. The premise is that Forest Whitaker's character lost in his mother in a tragic accident, and he's either crazy or she's a ghost, but he sees her all the time and apparently, she's telling him to take revenge on her killer, Anthony Mackie's character. I don't think that the latter character is well formed at all - even though he's supposed to be a kind of anti-hero, I didn't like him AT ALL.

Naturally this like any other movie has a predictable plot - but it's still good & moves along nicely. I see many complaints in the reviews about a lack of believability of the characters - especially Mike Epps - but I live in Louisiana & found everyone's role to be believable (except the Black lady teaching yoga to kids?!). It might just be difficult for them to see Mr. Epps playing a serious role instead of his typical comedic role which make his character not believable for some.

I agree with other reviewers the ending sucks, but reveals a secret.  The ending completes the storyline.  I wouldn't watch it again, only because it isn't a feel-good movie.  It leaves you wanting more, it doesn't spell out the final outcome.  If you like movies that leaves you imagining what the outcome might have been, watch this movie.  It alright, not the best acting, but who blames them with a pathetic lines, although it could have been better.  This movie failed in having at least one actor/actress that brings connection to the viewer- there was a disconnect that was missing. You be the judge.  For something similar to this movie, I recommend ""The Skeleton Key"" with Kate Hudson.",1423440000,,807,4.817518248175182

It was clear in the beginning what had happened to the trained mind but it seemed a little too clear.  More misdirection would have made the plot more misleading to the storyline.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and they did a great job for a movie with very little special effects.  I would recommend watching it so you can decide if you believe it was 5 stars or lower.  I thought it was a very good movie with Forest Whitaker as the main character along with the other main actors that kept the movie grounded for the audience.",1423440000,,683,4.483870967741935

Good acting by Anthony Mackie and a solid role by Forest Whitaker as always.  A little more brutal than necessary, but that is the trend today.  A psychological thriller sort of like ""Misery"".

6278530,2,B00IKM5L6I,"Repentance starts off as a reasonably sincere tale of a best-selling author/life coach (Anthony Mackie) who tries to help a grieving man (Forest Whitaker) come to turns with the death of his mother. But at the 35 minute mark, the movie suddenly jumps the tracks, turning into a bizarre, yet strangely conventional, hostage drama, with the psychologically disturbed client kidnapping and torturing the psychologist in an effort to prove which of the two is actually most in need of help.

The movie seems to be making the case that people like the Mackie character are just glib, overpaid shysters, taking advantage of peoples suffering by offering them little but shibboleths and bromides to help them cope with their problems - but any message the movie might be trying to convey is subsumed by the unpleasant melodramatics that come to dominate the second half. Yeomen that they are, Mackie and Whitaker work valiantly to overcome the various roadblocks that the script throws in their path, but even these two fine performers eventually have to concede that they're fighting a losing battle here. Even the surprise ending and moralistic message cant ultimately redeem this cinematic turkey.",1410739200,14,1193,5.149484536082475

6278622,1,B00IKM5L6I,"I've got one word for this movie. WOW.

Let me say that again. WOW.

And I had such high hopes. How often do we find a horror/thriller led by an African American cast? And when that cast is led by Forest Whitaker ... Oscar winning Forest Whitaker ... take your breath away with his acting Forest Whitaker .... you can't do anything but expect an impressive movie. Alas, that's not what was delivered.

Repentance is overwrought and underwhelming from beginning to end. The acting is stilted, the writing is dull, and the plot has people doing things that ... you know what I'm about to say ... doing things that people in their right mind wouldn't do.

Sanaa Lathan's husband is missing for two or three days; she's not worried. She's still teaching yoga classes.
Mike Epps gets a call to have a ""brotherly talk"" at a strange house he's never seen or been to before, and when he gets there all the lights are off. Yup, go on, knock on the door Mike.
Anthony Mackie was supposed to board a flight and now he's missing. No one even bothers to see if he ever boarded.

The movie is inept right down to the final scene **SPOILER ALERT NEXT** which include Forest walking down the street in an overcoat and his 5 year old daughter in nothing but a night clothes and house shoes.

Best thing to be said about Repentance is that it forced me to go to confession. And I'm not even Catholic ...",1406160000,33,1385,4.390625

6278703,3,B00IKM5L6I,"Trigger Warning(s): Torture Scenes

When it comes to some actors, there is just a go to style which seems to fit them well. For Will Smith, it is the likeable and approachable Black guy; Denzel Washington, as of late, recycles his Training Day persona; and then there is Forest Whitaker who usually plays off putting characters. This one is no different but, with a character which reminded me of Kathy Bates in Misery, the question is whether his portrayal as Angel was good, or just another awkward character of his to write off?

Characters & Story

A man with mental issues named Angel (Forest Whitaker) has lost his mom; his wife, to a point; and now all he has is his house and daughter. So needless to say, he is troubled. But there is one man he believes can help him: that man is Tommy Carter (Anthony Mackie) whose self-help book dealing with his brush with death seems to have had a profound effect on Angel. But as Angel reveals his demons, Tommy finds himself facing off with them and his own which involve wife Maggie (Sanaa Lathan), as well as Ben (Mike Epps). Leaving us with a film which makes it seem that Tommy may have taken on Angel's problems a bit too lightly.

Praise

As always, Whitaker playing an unnerving character just fits. It pretty much has been his signature, to me anyway, since Jason's Lyric in the 90s. And in this movie he is not only off putting, but a bit frightening as well. Arguably, Whitaker could probably play, with the right script, an iconic fictional villain again and perhaps set a precedent people would be trying to match for years. Though, it should be noted, the rest of the cast surely isn't slacking. Mackie hold his own against Whitaker and does attempt to compete for intensity. But you can see Whitaker's veteran status definitely gives him the upper hand.

Criticism

When it comes to the story though, it does require you to be a tad bit open-minded. For one, Whitaker as Angel is so off putting that it is hard to understand why Tommy would allow himself to be alone with this man. Then, when you add in Lathan and Epps' characters, you see a side-story there which isn't fully cohesive with the main story. For one, it doesn't act well as a break between Angel's mad moments, nor does it really draw you into either Lathan or Epps' characters fully. And two, as much as I understand they are there to beef up Tommy, neither character is written, or maybe portrayed, to the point you really care about them. Lathan's character, to me, barely evolves past being a shallow love interest. Then with Epps, who honestly I am just not fond of as an actor, not only are you given this brash and utterly unappealing character, but the attempt at giving him a proper backstory to draw sympathy out of you just feels utterly weak.

Overall: TV Viewing

Though I am not highly fond of either Lathan or Epps' characters, their place in the film hardly takes away from Whitaker and Mackie's story. If anything, Epps and Lathan are like a pickle which comes with your burger which wasn't asked for. But overall I am labelling this as ""TV Viewing"" since even though I like Whitaker and Mackie in this movie, honestly neither pushes the story to a place where it makes this ""Worth Seeing."" It is decent to spend some time with, especially if you are a fan of anyone involved, but this surely isn't the highlight of any of their careers. Just another film and another paycheck.",1403568000,7,3422,4.5602605863192185

Tommy Carter (Mackie) is an author and spiritual advisor who wrote a book about his near death experience and tries to help others deal with what they have gone through. When his brother gets into trouble Tommy thinks the best way to help is is to do one more one-on-one session. He offers to help Angel (Whitaker), a husband and father who lost his mother but still sees her. When Tommy tells him he can't help him anymore Angel doesn't like that answer. This is a movie that I had no idea what to expect out of it. I thought it was gonna be a little creepy but when it started becoming a little like Misery I got into it.  The acting is great from these two and the movie stays pretty tense the entire time but it was also a little draggy in some parts and I found it hard to totally stay focused on.
