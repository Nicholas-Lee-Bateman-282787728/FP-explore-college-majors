8500860,2,B006MHNLVA,This is a BOC Mini-Mig Welder instructional video and there are better free mig welding instructional videos on You Tube that have a more general (non brand specific) application.  The video quality is also pretty ordinary.,1385337600,,223,5.194444444444445
8500861,1,B006MHNLVA,maybe the most useless instructional video i have ever seen.  a total waste of money and time. well at least i laughed.,1381795200,,119,4.409090909090909
8500862,5,B006MHNLVA,These are great. I had taken a welding class and my husband wanted to catch up on knowledge also so he could weld too. These are paced very well and I think one gets a really good lesson on welding with them.,1334275200,,208,3.9761904761904763
