8207104,4,B00005PJ88,"great video besides some weird vert montages that don't really go with the rest of the video. all around classic parts from cards, kirchart, dollin, tosh, and henry def worth the buy.",1344902400,,183,4.75
8207105,5,B00005PJ88,This video ranks as one of the best videos of all time. The collaboration of styles and flavors is a perfect blend of technical and basically big skating. Heath Kirkchart deservingly won best video part of the year for this. His style is to be touched by none and all the people in this video are totally great. Henry Sanchez takes incredibly difficult tricks and just makes them look like childs play. John Cardiel rips it like none other. He is an amazing skater who can be apreciated by just about anyone. If you are a fan of skateboarding even if you're not you will LOVE this video. The montages are the best I've seen in a skatevideo.,1073779200,2,640,4.432203389830509
8207106,5,B00005PJ88,"if these men were famous movie stars this would have to be the most outstanding cast other than flips ""sorry"" or es's ""menikmati""i would think that this has to be my most favorite tws video now but, hey its your decision not mines!",1027036800,,231,4.395348837209302
8207107,5,B00005PJ88,"One of the best skate video's ever made in my opinion (and ever since watching the Bones Brigade Video Show I've seen most of them), it's worth buying for John Cardiel's mind-blowing part alone!
The version you can buy ...(produced by Redline) whilst being amazing does not have any of the extras that you get if you buy this DVD from a skate shop (or direct from TWS), so it's up to you - 40 minutes from here, or an hour plus (including a guide to the accordian with Matt Hensley, outtakes, photo gallery, chomp trailer and alternate edits) if you get the ""real"" version....",1022112000,6,576,4.495238095238095
8207108,5,B00005PJ88,this vid is great. Crazy skating and a great old school section!!!!! This will not dissapoint any skater!!!!!!!,1007164800,,111,5.222222222222222
8207109,5,B00005PJ88,"This video contains the most wide array of skateboarders i have ever seen in a video. This video has everything from handrail-gnar skating to vert, to hip hop ledge skating and even some park and pool skating. The video starts off with an intro that is expected from transworld. Then it goes to John Cardiel's part who goes faster and higher than anyone i've seen. Then we see the 16mm nontage with a bit of 35mm filming. Henry Sanchez is next along with marcus mcbride who tear up S.F. Then it takes a look at old school skaters still ripping which include matt hensly, lance mountain, the gonz , tommy guerrero and ray barbee. Then tosh townend gets crazy on some of the gnarliest handrails. After that, its the best montage that transworld has ever come up with. Dustin comes in with all the little baker ams. But the grand finale is heath kirchart. This part will give you a new perpective on handrail skating. An example of this is heath backside noseblunting the handrail at UCI. A good credit section follows which concludes one great video.",1001980800,2,1048,4.609625668449198
