5322163,3,B009DW5YA2,"I'm the kind of guy that wants the booklets and cases and even the covers to be included.  And I mean those extra covers that really serve no purpose, you know what I mean?  It's like a housing for the rest of the actual case?  Anyway, this was missing that .02c plastic sleeve and that irritated me to no end.  Other than that, it's a used item and showed some wear and tear as advertised.",1376006400,,390,4.16
5322164,4,B009DW5YA2,Classic Simpson episodes. Only reason I gave it four stars is because they charge $20 more so they can glue a mold on the original box of Otto' s head. I wish they would go back to the ones like homer was. They where worth the extra money.,1368403200,,239,4.0
5322165,5,B009DW5YA2,If you are a Simpsons fan. You have to own this one too.  I loved it and was happy with the package and when it came.

8540497,5,B009DW5YA2,"As with all the Simpsons Limited Collector's editions, Season 15 is awesome with Otto's pop out head on the cover. It is covered with a hard plastic to protect the cover, and the discs inside are snug in the pop out DVD cases. There are extras such as deleted scenes and Matt Groening's greeting. This is a must for all Simpsons fans!!!",1477612800,,336,4.435483870967742
