Globe Trekker stands out amongst travel videos because they are not afraid to stray off the beaten path and don't just do what regular (boring) travel shows do. In this episode, there is cock fighting and horse fighting. They do not glamorize these events, but the majority of Filipinos love these sports and to say otherwise is just being willfully ignorant. Just because other cultures do things that we do not do does not make it wrong or disgusting. Besides that, the natural beauty of the Philippine Islands is also well displayed and great travel advice is offered from other travelers.

Globe Trekker hasn't sold out yet so they are not trying to sell you a vacation. They just shoot interesting videos on location with fun loving travelers who are not afraid to try new things and occasionally push the envelope with local cuisine and customs. I hope the Globe Trekker series continues because the next best thing to traveling to exotic locations is watching these videos with awesome soundtracks and spectacular camera work.",1316563200,4,1091,4.897297297297297
8561592,1,B001D249S8,"This is my first Amazon review. I felt compelled to write after viewing this video. Not only is this DVD poorly produced, as the previous reviewer mentioned, it also presented mostly things that could make non-Filipinos think twice about visiting the Philippines. If I know nothing about the Philippines and just watch this video, I would not know that the Philippines is a beautiful country with modern facilities and many interesting places to visit. The DVD would discourage me from visiting the country. Fortunately, as an American who grew up in the Philippines - mind you, not in the gated subdivisions in Manila, but in a lovely city in Mindanao -  I know better than the traveler on this DVD. The majority of Filipinos do not believe in faith healers and have not been to cockfights or horse-fights (I've never even heard of this). Even some comments by other tourists in the videos are offensive. This DVD focuses on all the negative aspects of the country; it failed to present the good side.

DO NOT BUY THIS DVD - this is the worst product I've ever seen. The producers and host of this DVD owe the Filipino people a big apology. Shame on you for producing the DVD after you were graciously welcomed by them.

If you want to learn more about the Philippines, I recommend you call the nearest Philippines tourism office instead. Before visiting the Philippines in 2008, I called the office in Manhattan and they give me DVD's that showcase the Philippines as a tourist destination spot. My family enjoyed our two-weeks in the Philippines so much that we are planning to go back there next year after youngest graduates from Harvard.",1307836800,9,1643,4.757894736842105

This is why this DVD was such an amazing disappointment.  The DVD quality was extremely poor, with garbled sound and a less than crisp picture.  It had the look and feel of a DVD that someone illegally copied and tried to sell on the street.  Shame on Amazon for even advertising this DVD on its website and shame on Globe Trekker for putting out such a poor product.  The host was fine and the stories were interesting, but the entire experience was ruined by the low quality of the DVD itself.  Also, this is not one of Globe Trekker's more recent episodes.  It's time to go back and redo this episode!",1302912000,5,777,4.422535211267606
