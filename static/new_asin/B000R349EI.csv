8198519,1,B000R349EI,"I give this movie one star ONLY because there's no way to give it 'negative stars'.

Those who made this movie should be currently serving life sentences without parole for crimes against humanity.

Anyone giving this movie a rating of more than one star (required in order to provide a review) is, likewise, guilty of 'felony lying' and would likely would have been horsewhipped for it in bygone days!

Actually, I apologize. It's actually much worse than that...",1469491200,,464,4.923076923076923

8198521,1,B000R349EI,"UFO: Target Earth.  Sounds exciting, doesn't it?  An alien invasion, man's desperate attempt to defend his home from a more advanced and deadly enemy, lots of explosions and heroics, etc.  That would be an exciting story - unfortunately, you will find nothing resembling that in this wretched little movie.  UFO: Target Earth's only claim to fame is its ridiculously lengthy shot of a boom mic clearly exposed on screen.  Honestly, it has to hold the world record for this particular cinematic faux pas - and that's just one of a myriad of problems with this film.  The pitiful excuse of a plot doesn't make much sense, scenes and characters are introduced in such a way that we're apparently supposed to just magically know who and what they are, and the main character's big moments consist of staring off into space as if he's in some kind of hypnotic trance (either that, or he had just seen the dailies from the previous day's filming of this turkey).

So, anyway, this weird teacher dude specializing in communications decides to study some UFO sightings in the area - especially after picking up his phone and hearing a couple of military guys talking about that very subject.  This is just one of several plot elements that make no sense.  It is established later on that all such military communications are scrambled, and even if they weren't, it's not like the local college shares a party line with the military base.  Anyway, our young Alan Grimes (Nick Plakias) plows ahead, assisted by a young woman who can ""feel"" the approach of UFOs (Cynthia Cline) and a Dr. Mansfield (LaVerne Light).  Don't ask me exactly who Dr. Mansfield is or where she works because the film doesn't bother to divulge these facts.  As for Alan, he sets up some kind of sensors around a lake that may or may not hold an alien craft beneath its murky waters, some electronic nonsense takes place, and eventually something ""profound"" happens, accompanied by lots of electronic spin art.  I could tell you how it all ends, but it's so stupid that you probably wouldn't believe me.

This film's title is mere cinematic chicanery.  Needless to say, there is nothing even remotely like an alien invasion to be found here; heck, the only UFOs you'll see are the ones in the pictures accompanying the opening credits.  UFO: Target Earth is basically a torture test.  To even get to the headache-inducing electronic spin art at the end, you have to endure well over an hour of complete gibberish punctuated by strands of inanely irritating music (often simultaneously, with the music drowning out the dialogue).  The whole thing makes very little sense and features some of the most lifeless acting and poorly written dialogue you've ever been forced to put up with.  I can't think of a single positive thing to say about this pathetic waste of film.",1303430400,,2831,4.788065843621399
8198522,2,B000R349EI,"""UFO-Target Earth"" is a wretched film made in Georgia in 1974. It has all the signs of being a student film, and while presenting itself initially as a pseudo-documentary, it quickly falls into the abyss of bad electronic music and never looks back. I cannot tell you how oppressive or inappropriate the music in this film is; unfortunately it's also one of the better features of the movie.

The film follows an electronics expert, Alan, from a local college as he seeks to find an alien spacecraft at the bottom of a lake near a power plant. He is assisted by a totally wacky woman who feels ""energy"" from the UFO, who also hyperventilates a lot, and who has the power to psychically cause a record player to malfunction. The plot is slow and heavy-handed. The acting is absolutely terrible, but the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious. Sample: ""Sometimes I feel like I'm teetering on the edge of an enormous chasm of time and space: it's a swaying sensation, like I'm about to fall in."" A couple of hours of that and you will be praying for more electronic music. Fortunately, that's right around the corner. The end of the movie is nothing more than seemingly endless psychedelic color blotches accompanied by electronic music (hey, at least the cast isn't talking) representing the concept that Alan's dreams can free the energy aliens from their aquatic bondage. We know this because the energy aliens speak through a TV set, prompting Alan to proclaim ""We are beyond the jaws of darkness"". In other words, this is a total mess: it makes absolutely zero sense, it is plodding to an inhumane degree, and is self-righteous and pretentious with no reason for being that way (like much of the 1970's, come to think of it).

For conventional entertainment value, this should get less than one star, but since there are several unintentionally hilarious scenes lending it some serious camp horsepower, I'm giving it two stars. This would have made an unbelievably excellent episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1212796800,,2016,4.87463556851312
8198523,2,B000R349EI,"A really odd, low-budget film. Starts off with real interviews of UFO encounters and segways into a theme that is a catchy little title sequence number called ""Between The Attic and The Moon"" that's a smooth 70's sounding piece of electronic easy rock. The story-An electronics expert accidently hears a telephone conversation he shouldn't have, and this leads him to discover odd signals that may lead to an alien spacecraft at the bottom of a lake in a rural area, that may have been there for a generation or two. Using a plethoria of high tech instruments(circa 1974) he attempts to make contact. The whole thing has a poor-man's 2001 feel to it toward the end. The acting, set ups and everything are pretty low-budget, and have all the look of a student film. Back in the day(1974) this was released as a double feature, the 2nd half of a bill that had THE DEVIL'S TRIANGLE which was a documentary cashing in on all the hype of that during the mid-70's. I remember seeing this film under the impression it was to be a documentary. There are few ""special effects"" to speak of-only some video effects which get pretty boring fast and a piece of slapdash animation of a space ship and starfield.  This was a product of it's time, when even small film companies and indie filmmakers could easily get their cheaply made films onto the market via drive-ins and 2nd run theaters(both mostly gone). Drips everything 1970's....",1182643200,8,1423,4.714859437751004
