8158650,4,6304047053,"When I first saw ""Lyric Nitrate"" - a successful Dutch documentary, shown at the 16th So Paulo Film Festival in 1992 - I concluded that this kind of feature can be very melancholic. There are, at  least, three reasons that sustain my point of view. First we are told, in  the opening credits, that most of nitrate-made films - a perishable product  that doesn't last very long - were lost forever. That is, the memory of the  cinema irremediably gone by. The second reason: what we see in the  fragments of silent films - collected in the 1905-1915 period - are scenes  of death, passion, crowded and disorganized cities, desolated beaches,  everything that gives us a tight in the throat. These two reasons combined  produce a third and fatal reason. In the age of Dolby-Digital sound and  pure, digitalized images, we feel very lonely and sad seeing those  pictures. A loneliness that hurts so much - in a word, only existed in  portuguese, ""saudade"" - the solitude that provokes our deepest and sadest  feelings.",960768000,4,1014,4.764367816091954
