7504632,5,B017GEWE5Q,Where has this series been hiding for 5 decades?  Dick Kallman has a lot of fun impersonating numerous students - so he can drop-in to their classes.  All of the supporting cast is given some memorable plot lines throughout the series.  This set starts with the black & white pilot film: the rest of the episodes are in color.,1462320000,4,326,4.491525423728813
7504633,5,B017GEWE5Q,My wife and I liked this even better than we thought we would. It's a well-done comedy from the 1960s that doesn't get syrupy-sweet. Every episode is upbeat and very enjoyable!,1459728000,4,176,4.709677419354839

7504636,5,B017GEWE5Q,I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE TV COMEDY HANK,1453852800,,40,3.5555555555555554
7504637,4,B017GEWE5Q,"I remember this show for its catchy theme song: ""He's up with the sun, and he's got the college ringin' as he goes about another swingin' day........""",1451433600,3,150,4.592592592592593
7504638,5,B017GEWE5Q,"I remembered this show from the 1960's and was totally suprised that Warner Archive has released this series. Picture quality is great. By the way I ordered this item from an Amazon 3rd party seller and my set is ""Pressed"" not ""Burned DVD-Rs""",1448496000,10,242,4.651162790697675
8739076,5,B017GEWE5Q,"I was six when this series premiered in 1965 but remembered nothing about it other than the closing credits. Until I recently found this Warner Archives DVD-R collection on a Google search, I had been asking people about it for years just to see if I had imagined it! Surprising picture quality for a show that ran for just one season so long ago (obviously the archive at Warner Brothers took a lot of care to preserve the film stock). All episodes of the complete series (1965-1966) are included. In color other than the black and white pilot episode.",1532131200,,553,4.595959595959596
8739077,5,B017GEWE5Q,"First off, the image quality for these 50+ year old episodes is excellent. The first episode, no doubt the pilot, was in B&W and a bit grainy. After that, the color episodes look sharp and bright.

This almost forgotten comedy was charming, and has my wife and I literally laughing out loud in spots. I vaguely remembered it from when I was a kid. I do remember seeing commercial promos before it aired, but I don't think I got to see much of the show. That would make sense as it was up against The Wild Wild West, very popular that season and one of my childhood favorites. It's lead-in (the first half-hour of Wild Wild West, was a completely forgotten show called ""Camp Runamuck"". It really had no chance to fare well in the ratings, no matter how good the show was.

Hank and his 9 year old sister are orphans, and evidently have been for three years. Hank sells anything he can, plus provides various services, to make money on a college campus. He can't attend because he dropped out of high school to support himself and his sister. But realizing he will need an education, he takes advantage of student absences to ""drop in"" on classes.

Much of the comedy arises out of funny events as he impersonates students and tries to avoid being caught by, of all people, his girlfriend's father. His girlfriend and one philosophy prof know what he's up to. The college coach has seen him run to get to classes, and is trying to catch him to put him on the track team.

Dick Kallman does a great job as Hank, particularly since he has to meld into many roles as he impersonates students. He was truly talented. He was actually 32 or 33 years old for this series, but looks young and sells his role as a college age kid very well.

The show only lasted one season, but evidently had enough warning before they wrapped up filming to air a real ""last episode"" ... beating other planned ""last shows"" by at least a decade.

Sadly, Dick Kallman and a business partner were murdered in his NY apartment in 1980, during a robbery -- a tragic end for a very smart, talented man.",1528675200,,2069,4.417322834645669
8739078,5,B017GEWE5Q,I can barely remember this show(I was 10 years old) when it aired. I do recall I really enjoyed it and thought it was very funny. I didn't think it would ever see the light of day again but now here it is! The picture and sound are great and with the exception of the first episode it is presented in living color. There are no extras which is somewhat of a disappointment because at least two of the stars are still alive. I am hoping more of these 60's one season wonders will be released on DVD. This 53 year old show is still so much better than the garbage on tv today,1521763200,,573,4.035087719298246
8739079,5,B017GEWE5Q,"I'm not sure if this sitcom patterned my life or if it simply resonated because of foreknowledge! At any rate, I really enjoyed it.",1502496000,,131,4.5
8739080,5,B017GEWE5Q,"Wow, this is one TV show I thought would never see the light of day again. I remember watching it when I was in junior high school. I even remember the last show when Hank finally became a ""registered student"". This was one TV show that was to be a one season and out show. I remember too well Dick Kallman who had one great personality and he carried the show. He did not have a long life. He and his long term partner were shot to death in their apartment during a robbery heist in 1980. It was a sad ending to a brilliant actor who left us too soon. I did not even know ""Hank"" was even available until a few weeks ago and I had to have it . I hope there will be more TV shows dragged out of the vaults and made public. Another one I would love to see again is ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies"" with Pat Crowley and Mark Miller. I would buy it in a heartbeat. I love these old TV shows !!",1501200000,,887,3.879120879120879
8739081,5,B017GEWE5Q,Just like I remembered show over 50 years ago! Great picture and sound quality too.,1489190400,,83,4.6
8739082,5,B017GEWE5Q,"Good Show! Never heard of it before so took a chance on it. Love the old series, But kinda wish they would have left it in Black and White.",1483315200,2,139,3.8275862068965516
8739083,4,B017GEWE5Q,"Hank is a great concept for a show- a poor kid who takes care of his sister sneaks into college classes just for the love of education and he gets all caught up in the subterfuge.  The problem I have is that while I knew two homeless kids who actually did this at my university- scraping together enough money to pay for a class, but attending 4 or 5, this doesn't reflect enough of the reality of what this life would be like and when it ceases to feel real, it slides off the rails like My Mother The Car- the story moves with real plot holes which frustrate rather than entertain.  But there really aren't college sitcoms set in 1965-66 and this does fit that need- kind of what one might have expected if Patty Duke did fourth 1966-67 series with Patty and Cathy in college.  It's an inventive story, but it shows real flaws in networks of the era pushing a show entirely on gimmick without following through on the writing- like My Mother the Car, It's About Time, or later seasons of My Favorite Martian, or the All-American blandness of the final seasons of Ozzie and Harriett or Ozzie's Girls.",1482710400,3,1101,4.413793103448276
8739084,5,B017GEWE5Q,This was a great series that only lasted for one season. I remember watching it as a kid.,1479859200,2,89,4.0
