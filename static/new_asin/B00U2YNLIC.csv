7028277,5,B00U2YNLIC,"A woman suffering from sexual dysfunction travels to her home town with her boyfriend to try and uncover her past and discover the root of her issues, but instead discovers that her hometown is filled with strange people who are not very welcoming. The weird small town, a staple in the horror genre. Overdone? Definitely. But this indie feature injects a new life into it with a downright incredible level of creativity. Gorgeously shot with incredibly engaging direction, there was honestly never a dull moment. And the constant sense of dread and foreboding, even before they get to the town, is very impressive. Good acting, excellent pace and a story that is anything but predictable, this film is the finest indie feature Ive seen in a while. Impressive. 4.5/5",1436745600,11,766,4.945736434108527

7028279,4,B00U2YNLIC,"Had to entirely delete my old reviews and  rewrite this one because I missed the LITERAL warning by Jo in Jo's first post.

Thank you, Jo.

So now I need to tone down my rant and I have to raise my review rating by one star. Indeed, the movie cover warns this is all based on a real woman's dreams. The director gets my respect because he did a fantastic job of keeping me at the edge of my seat.. filming  with believable realism the rational progression of the story. The unknown actors also contributed a talented treatment to the material.

 Regardless...I want to warn the reader of this review.. that you should not read beyond  where I say SPOILER BELOW, or you might learn more than you bargained for.

Who should watch this film? In my opinion; aspiring movie directors, people who want new ideas from old tropes, a perfect study in human dysfunctional psychology, people who like dreams and symbolism...and most important, people who can deal with movies that do not resolve perfectly at the end.

As a former psych therapist and avid traveler in my younger years I must add that not only would an anti-social town behave in the manner that these residents did...but to your horror, I claim that such towns really DO exist. But most probably in the lawless areas of Mexico, where they could get away with the greatest atrocities enacted in this movie. (Now don't go pointing a wicked finger at me for being a Donald Trump supporter, as I think Trump is a Chump... and suggest you read the facts of what is happening in Mexico WITHIN their country)

--- SPOILERS BELOW -- though partial --

The movie does progress as if to promise you are getting a coherent story. However, you are not. There are moments of coherence and then total abandonment. In a dream, such license is a given. Have you ever recalled a dream that makes sense IN THE DREAM, but when you wake up, it is as clear as day how foolish and nonsensical the events were?

And so with this movie... the sequences will never add up as a sum total.

You will also notice devices by the director that deliver different moods and tonality. Scenes are filmed in both color and black and white, which seem to suggest which is the reality.. versus dreaming... or the recollection of lost memories.

 The director, in my opinion, counts on our need to rationalize the scenes shot in color.. to keep our interest, as we try to predict what will come next.. and anticipate how far the horror will take us down the rabbit hole.

And although it delivers some form of a story... I must ask for what purpose? The movie cannot be a pure collection of dreams, because dreams do not play out in such depth as this movie did. So then what is this movie? Is it a play out of ideas in the same vein as the Phastasm movies series?

I did not see the warning label on the DVD cover, and even if I had seen it, I probably would have thought, 'no.. who is going to make a literal translation of a series of dream sequences without remixing it back into a coherent story?'

So for anyone who watched this movie, I am offering you a very clever answer to how the movie could have been brilliantly mastered into a twist ending that is in line with masterpieces like ... The Babadook, The Sixth Sense, Kill List, The Others.. and other movies that leave bread crumbs in clear daylight, but you have to watch a second time to understand how the director fooled us.

My spoiler breakdown.. and re-interpretation..

If you finish this movie, watch the movie again.
Assume this time that all the scenes shot in color are actual dreams from the POV of the lead female character.
They are long,not totally coherent in summation, but below I will explain why it can make sense

Assume the black and white scenes are HER real memories coming back (not dreams)
Assume these dreams are her subconscious telling her conscious what happened to her as a child
Assume they also include entwined tidbits of what really happens AS she hallucinates during a psychotic breakdown

One black and white scene needs to be re-mastered
Where you see the boyfriend talking to the grandfather with his eyes gouged out
Reimage the director changing this to the main female lead sneaking upon a secret conversation with the grandfather
But his eyes are NOT gouged out, so the real surprise is the betrayal of the boyfriend
Continue watching with the suspicion that this scene really happened.

-- If you are too lazy to do this exercise, then here is what could have been --

The girl NEVER left the town of Shaol (in her psychotic lapse, she escaped as a child)
The little girl was sexually abused by the grandfather; as they all lived in his house
Her mostly absent father was a deadbeat, possibly never lived in that town and somewhere else
The mother discovered this and snatched up the little girl to live at the neighbors
The mother stabbed the grandfather in the gut during a pursuit, it may or may not have been fatal
The lead female character grew up in Shaol
The boyfriend was also from Shaol and was conspiring with everyone else not to let her leave
The residents did practice some form of hedonistic rituals in the forest
The residents were mostly drug addicts and jobless, inheriting their homes
Due to the abuse, the lead female character devolved periodic psychotic breaks
She burned down her own house as a teen.. possibly killing her mother
The lead female continued to mentally disintegrate, possibly sharing her plot to leave the town with her bf
The bf told the grandfather of the plot
Having been discovered, the lead character goes on ONE HUGE psychotic break
These lapses superimpose hallucinations, false memories or self-created stories as she acts out her reality

It his HERE the movie begins...
All color scenes are her fantasies of what happened.
In her fantasy, she and her Mom escaped the town at a young age
They moved to Texas
Her fantasy BF is from Texas, representing the sex-less pure love she never had
In this fantasy creation, should could forget all the horrible truths

The psychotic break is just a break, inevitably, the truth must resurface
She still has the ability to see reality during some normal moments
Reality starts to bleed into her fantasy and hallucinations.. of course, in the form of a therapist

Her mind tries to defend itself by showing us a believable plot
Blame is shifted to a town who will endlessly murder anyone who tries to leave the town
She imagines a scene where two outsiders must die for penance of their desire to escape
We see how the shrink (reality) inevitably brings her back to Shaol
At the same time, superimposing hallucinations over the real activities..
Which all occur IN Shoal because she never left that town as a child and is still there.
We do see moments of some sane clarity...
These are seen through the dream sequences (filmed in back and white)

The lead female does really plan her escape
The psychotic version of the escape are all scenes shot in color
During this escapade, we get a blend of dreams, hallucinations and memory recollections
But there is a reality that is bleeding through in the back and white scenes..
She kills her grandfather, probably imagining she killed someone else trying to kill her
She also kills her boyfriend and then thinks she is burying a body, to hide her escape
This explains why she sees her bf fall out of her grandfather's coffin
Did she think she killed her grandfather during a psychotic fit? (Instead killing her bf?)

At some point, with her BF and grandfather gone, she can escape the town quietly
However, to absolve her crimes, she instead imagines the town as senseless murderers
They pursue her relentlessly as her perfect mental alibi to her own crimes
She imagines her BF did not die... imagining him as the perfect man, assisting her escape as her hero
There is no priest or priests daughter.. or they are not part of the madness
There are no murders, just isolated town folk with serious issues
Many are drug addicts and some do hedonistic rituals in the woods
She happens upon this orgy during her escape
Evidenced by the blend of both color scenes (at night) mixed with b&w scenes
She manages to get to the field, where she collapses in exhaustion.
She has an out of body dream revealing more suppressed memories
It signals that the psychotic break may have runs its course and be ending
It makes sense that she must hastily fantasize recue by the police car
As her psychotic world is crumbling, she fantasizes the shrink session
She tells the shrink her lost memories, setting the fall back to reality
The boyfriend goes to the soda machine, gets the coin he left behind
This TRIGGERS the end of her psychotic lapse

The girl wakes up in the field alone, with knife and gun at her side
The coin is in her hand, forcing her to completely question where she is what has happened
The orgy members who might have seen her go past the camp are looking for her
They know that the bf is missing and her absence at the event is questioned
The main character looks up at the sky and realizes the town may NOT have been killing people
She may not have been chased by the town at all
She realizes that she may have done some horrible things to those she cared about
The orgy members close in, but if you notice, without any weapons.. probably bewildered, if nothing else.
The only murders were done by her, the real monster the town created now lives within her

Again, you have to interpret all the events as a point of view through the mind of a person having a psychotic break. From my experience of working with such patients, including young a young teen who tried to murder his own parents, this explanation not only works, but could have happened.

Thanks for reading and thanks for Lex's response (the movie director) to my earlier reviews.",1436227200,9,9802,4.583428571428572
7028280,4,B00U2YNLIC,"I liked this movie alot for what it was. A low budget  movie, no frills, no beautiful homes or locations. No professional make up or wardrobe. That being said this movie should not have been filmed any other way! It is dark,creepy, freaky and i think  based on and written around  someones actual dreams (nightmares) and/or experiences she had as a child. The acting was pretty good also. It starts out with 2 strangers becoming travel mates  together  visiting  this creepy town and the main character Ada who was on a journey to her past (she grew up in said creepy town) found an interesting memory tucked away in her mind at  the end which revealed the answer for her emotional problems. Her boyfriend Calvin was the ever patient loyal  dude from start to finish , the aunt was some kind of perfectly played crackhead and the preacher played good guy/bad guy with intense creepiness and his daughter sang beautifully a haunting song that for me was one of the freakiest parts of the movie, I'm still not sure if she was supposed to be a ghost or just another freak like her father. The movie (like any good nightmare) confused me,  and creeped me out.  My
husband wants to see it tomorrow and i will def watch it again with him - a rarity for me. I liked it , i wouldn't spend the ridiculous amount of $33 they are charging for blue ray- but the $9 was fair for the dvd",1435104000,12,1373,4.391304347826087

7028306,1,B00U2YNLIC,"Calvin (Micheal Foulk) and Ada (Lisa Friedrich) have bad sex which she blames on his ""cloud of bad stuff around him."" (This is as good as the dialogue gets.) He is patient with her, and it makes you wonder if they ever had sex. They return to her backward home town of Sheol, Oklahoma, apparently the US equivalent of Japan's suicide forest judging from the first scene. They hope to do some sort of regression, face the old demon therapy which includes black and white films of dreams and flashbacks. The town is a bit odd, although not too far from the norm for small rural Oklahoma towns that hates outsiders. Up to this point in life we find out Calvin's biggest life regret was ""not dancing with the Smurfs"" at age 6.

The film was boring. The characters were impossible to get into. The camera work wasn't great, and I got motion sickness as the pair walked. The sound inside the psychologist's office had a background noise to it. The acting lacked and the supporting cast was even worse.

The DVD cover has 6 award looking marks which upon closer notice are simply ""official selection"" which is the equivalent of a T-Ball trophy.

7028331,2,B00U2YNLIC,"While the film's introduction is pretty enthralling, everything afterword is just... Well, not good.

It wants to be mumblecore, it wants to be Lynchian, it wants to be an arthouse, it wants to be a grindhouse and it wants to be interpretive...

It's as if the filmmakers watched a bunch of popular horror flicks from the aforementioned canons and simply tried to throw them into a blender. The beginning hints at a great storyline, but the mystery and cryptic atmosphere is immediately done away with in favor of a slow-burn, rocky romance between two rather dull people. As the focus is switched, Meet Me There becomes humdrum. The compelling feature is done away with until the very end and even then--feels like a missed opportunity for something that could have been unique.

During the final run to the finish, Meet Me There tries to shock/intensify with some nudity and violence but it all lacks impact (as the protagonists don't react realistically at all) and comes off as actually pretty humorous.

You've seen this sort of horror movie a lot and Meet Me There doesn't do anything new (or better) with it. The intro is cool, but the rest of the movie, eh, not so much.",1439596800,5,1178,4.7317073170731705

8704235,3,B00U2YNLIC,"It's tough to rate certain parts of this movie.  The entire production is very low budget of course but parts of it still manage to shine.  The acting by the two leads does feel a little stiff but this also makes them a little more real to me.  They're a physical mismatch as Calvin is short, chubby, and hairy (I can sympathize with all three) and Ada is tall and very pretty in a broken sort of way.  But it's this brokenness that sort of makes things work.  Ada obviously has some issues and Calvin, while not a male model, is a sort of rock of a boyfriend who is trying to help.  Again, their relationship works for some reason and this is a pretty big part of the movie.  Some of the secondary characters are well acted as well (Ada's aunt as well as Dustin Runnels as the Preacher stand out.)  However I have to knock the movie for the story.  It seems like there's something there but it's never really explored or revealed in much of a way.  I'm not asking for everything to be spelled out but a little more explanation would have helped.  You can tell that the writer definitely had some ideas for what's going on in the background but in the end, the story is too murky to be all that enjoyable.
