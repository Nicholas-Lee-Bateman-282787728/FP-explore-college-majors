8448231,5,B004YE7812,"This is a remarkable story, born before World War II, and destined to continue for generations.  Just like the great medieval Gothic cathedrals, the carving of Crazy Horse out of the mountain in South Dakota will likely take generations, and has become a work of the people.

The story is one of storytelling in stone - indeed, sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski has 'storyteller in stone' carved on his tomb at the base of the giant sculpture/mountain.  Begun as a request to help the Native American peoples preserve their heritage, Korczak moved to the area in South Dakota in 1947 and, turning down government money, proceeded to start the long task of transforming the mountain into a project larger than that of the great pyramids of ancient Egypt, with less than $1000 to his name.

There is an art and a science to carving on this scale.  Dramatic explosions, powered and hand tools are all used to varying degrees to carve this mammoth structure, the face of which is by itself nearly 10 storeys tall. The video shows the transformation over the decades of the face and most basic structure of Crazy Horse atop a horse, overlooking his land.  'My land is where my people are buried', he once said, and his gaze now majestically soars over the landscape.

This is not just the story of one man, Crazy Horse, or one crazy sculptor from Poland named Korczak.  This has become a family affair; roughly half the video was filmed after Korczak's death in 1982, showing the remarkable progress that continues slowly but surely to take place - the face was dedicated as a completed project in the late 1990s, with Korczak's wife Ruth in charge of the ongoing project, and Korczak's children in charge of various aspects of drilling, construction, tourist management, design and fundraising to keep the project going.

This is the 'fifth granite face', one not of another president on Mount Rushmore, but of one of the leaders of another people on the same American soil.  Korczak's narration for part, and other's narration for the rest of the video pay tribute to the workers of this project and tribute to the Native American inspiration, and hold this project as one of the hopes for the future of American society.  This will be story set in stone.",1127692800,,2246,4.777777777777778
