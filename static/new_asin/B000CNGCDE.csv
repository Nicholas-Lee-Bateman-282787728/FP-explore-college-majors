8099794,4,B000CNGCDE,I really like thefact that you can hear the documentary in both spanish and english. I'm trying to teach my 2yr old both languages. He is fascinated by penguins. This film is able to captivate his attention and I've learned a few things about penguins myself.,1232150400,2,259,4.6521739130434785
8099795,5,B000CNGCDE,I'm physically disabled and walk similar to how a Penguin does and growing up kids used to tease me in school by calling me Penguin and it hurt me very badly but overtime it became my nickname that I've come to respect and love. I Love Penguins not only bcuz they're beautiful but I have many things in common with the Life of a Penguin. I watched March of the Penguins and it was okay. But this movie is even better. It's beautifully made and doesn't have sad endings like March of the Penguin did. Not that I'm trying to bash that movie cuz that was well made as well. This is more like a documentary/educational film about the many different Penguin species. I'd like to be a Penguin for the day. Overall this DVD is beautifully made and worth every penny. I could watch this over and over and never get tired of watching it. I give it a 10+ rating !,1160092800,18,853,4.2392638036809815
