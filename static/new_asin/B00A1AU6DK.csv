5374953,5,B00A1AU6DK,"Seventy years ago America was a different place.  Even though this film might appear to be dated or sentimental to some, it does portray the values of a time that is no more.  What a powerful impact this must have made in 1943 when families were losing their sons all over America.  Don Ameche and Frances Dee give moving performances and the story moves along at a very natural pace.  If you want to see what small towns were like and what was important to us in the early 1940s, pay close attention to this film, and be prepared to shed a few tears.",1362096000,11,551,4.269230769230769

8546006,5,B00A1AU6DK,"This is a World War II era movie about a family in a small town and the tragedy of war.  It is beautifully done.  The movie could have been too painful to watch, but was very sensitive and touching.

The movie is based on a novel of the period authored by MacKinlay Kantor.  I have not read that novel. I did read ""Signal Thirty Two"", a 1950 police novel.  It was very good.  MacKinlay Kantor also wrote a work that ended up being the basis of a very great post World War II movie, ""The Best Years Of Our Lives"".

I love this movie.  It appears to be largely overlooked at this time.  However if one is looking for an excellent, touching movie from World War II, this is worth your attention.  Thank You...",1494979200,,706,4.201492537313433

8546009,4,B00A1AU6DK,"""Happy Land"" was made in 1943, at the height of the American involvement in World War 2.  Don Ameche stars as a storekeeper in a small town.  Ameche's son is in the marines and killed and the film traces Ameche's grief process. The depiction of small time life is idealised through a series of flashbacks.  Ameche is accompanied by the spirit of his grandfather who died at the time his son was born. In this cynical age, this gentle and moving film could seem dated but the care and sensitivity with which it has been written and directed makes it very moving.  Ameche gives a simple subtle performance, aided by Frances Dee as his wife. Harry Carey is invaluable as Grandpa.

The film has been issued in the Fox Cinema Archives Series which means it is bare-bones and expensive. The print is OK.",1452297600,,797,4.545454545454546

8546012,5,B00A1AU6DK,"I saw this on MoviesTvNetwork recently, I quickly fell in love with this truly underrated classic.  I say that because I would've loved to have grown up in a town like this, the mythical Hartsfield IA.
What a sad broken world we reside in today.  Yes, I know they had problems also, the Depression was no bowl of cherries to be sure, however, the societal clue that held communities together, Christianity, was still an important part of life then.  And now, because of the church's reluctance to actually live as Christ commands us, our wonderful ""HAPPY LAND"" is now the laughing stock of our world.
Full disclosure: I was a Marxist/atheist at one time, now a Pastor/christian apologist.",1406246400,3,688,4.813559322033898
8546013,5,B00A1AU6DK,"I went into this film with a little trepidation.  I was born in the Sixties and I've never known war or the kind of war my parents' generation knew.  A lot of these films designed to firm the resolve of the home front were good pieces for their time but would seem dated or clichd today.  ""Happy Land"" quelled my reservations.  It begins with a father(Don Ameche) mourning the loss of his son in combat.  Through the course of the film the father goes through the various stages of the grieving.  He doesn't get over the loss but begins accepting the reality and goes forth knowing that his son didn't die in vain.  The film earns its tears honestly.  The sentiments and the emotions portrayed are real.  There has never been a more just conflict like the Second World War but the message of ""Happy Land"" can be applied to present or future engagements.",1371168000,6,853,4.487012987012987
