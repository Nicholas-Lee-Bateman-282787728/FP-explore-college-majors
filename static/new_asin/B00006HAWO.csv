1758909,5,B00006HAWO,Purchased as a gift! So far no complaints so I'm happy!,1355184000,,55,4.090909090909091
1758910,3,B00006HAWO,"It was ok for a return series, it would have been great if the made more.  I prefered the original series,and also would have like more of that series.",1354320000,,151,4.206896551724138
1758911,3,B00006HAWO,"Yes, as someone who loved the original series, it was nice to see these two actors again; Culp and Cosby had real chemistry on the screen.  But what spoiled the movie for me most was that this was so obviously an attempt to spin off a new TV series based on the new Kelly/Robinson characters.  If you're an ""I Spy"" fan and haven't seen this movie, then you will certainly want to have a look.  But you'll probably only watch it once, so get it as cheap as you can.  Better yet, see if your local library can get it for you through interlibrary loan.",1296691200,3,549,4.2
1758912,3,B00006HAWO,"It was great to see Kelly and Scotty back together again after all these years.  However, there was a vital difference in the way things were handled for this reunion movie compared to the original series: the movie was played for laughs while the original was played straight.  Yes, they had lots of enjoyable banter as partners in the TV series, with plenty of joking around.  But (unlike ""Get Smart"", their competition at the time), ""I Spy"" took the espionage missions seriously.  Here the basic scenario is comic, with the retired agents bumbling about in an unofficial attempt to watch over their kids as they follow in their dads' footsteps.

The movie ends with Scott being asked (about the job): ""Do you miss it?""
His response: ""No -- just him.""

As a bit of nostalgia this flick is wonderful.  As a movie, it's nothing special, which was disappointing; the original series really *was* something special.",1281052800,10,913,4.851612903225806
1758913,5,B00006HAWO,Not as good as the series but it should not be missed. Too bad they could not have had a bit part in Eddie Murphy and Wilson movie I Spy.,1243209600,2,137,3.6
1758914,5,B00006HAWO,This is a great movie and I was very excited to get it and Amazon is the greatest place to get new & used items of any kind. Thanks Preston in NM,1129161600,,145,3.5625
1758915,4,B00006HAWO,"Reunion movies tend to have their faults.  This one is no exception, although I would think it was better than average.  Yes, they go with the silly 'the kids are taking over Dad's job, and Dad sneaks around to make sure they don't screw up' plot.  However, this really shines in the same place the original series did -- the interaction and dialogue between Cosby and Culp.  After all this time, they were still being those characters!  Yes, while the scene where they are tied up naked might have been a little more fun if they had been a bit younger *cough*, it led to a wonderful scene.  The young stars are pleasant enough, and do their best with what they're given.",1104278400,17,671,4.459016393442623
1758916,3,B00006HAWO,"With the exception of the rather long series of Alien Nation reunion movies, few TV-movies showing old stars in their old roles have had much success, and this funnied-up resurrection of Kelly and Scotty follows the rule. Getting the progeny of the two heroes together as the new generation spies was as obvious as it was silly, and the writers couldn't resist the urge to make the show a parody of itself. There is no suspense, and it's impossible to take the characters at all seriously. On the plus side, it does feature an early appearance of the beautiful Salli Richardson, who has gone on to co-star in the Sci-Fi Channel's ""Eureka!"", as Scotty's daughter.",1033516800,5,662,4.765217391304348

7968857,5,B00006HAWO,"Despite the slander surrounding Dr. William Cosby--he, and his friend acting in this movie are still the coolest guys.",1455580800,,118,5.2631578947368425

7968859,5,B00006HAWO,Robert Culp and Bill Cosby What a combination.,1412726400,,46,4.875
7968860,5,B00006HAWO,Just like the series needed it to complete all the I spy series,1407110400,,63,3.923076923076923
7968861,4,B00006HAWO,"Scott and Robinson are back decades later.  Robinson (Robert Culp) has a corner office at the CIA and college teacher Kelly Scott (Bill Cosby) barges in to confront his old pard about recruiting Scott's daughter.  Together, they follow the daughter and her partmer, Robinson's son, on their first mission in Vienna.  They work well together, as always, remain convincingly light and amusing while tightening up for the confrontations with the bad guys when needed.  It's a satisfying reunion episode.  Not nearly as lame or pointless as many reunion episodes are for other series.  Still love that theme music...more orchestral in this one but with very appealing variation.",1383868800,,674,5.252336448598131
7968862,5,B00006HAWO,"I really enjoyed the movie. The actors were a lot older but then, so are we. I wish they had spun this off to a new series featuring the kids. That would be fantastic.",1371772800,,167,3.9411764705882355

7968864,5,B00006HAWO,EVERY THING THESE MEN DO WAS ABOVE AVERAGE. THEY ALWAYS APEAR TO WORKED  WELL TOGEATHER. IF THEY ARE BOTH ALIVE IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THEM AGAIN.,1361145600,,147,4.25
