8372550,5,B002LEXABY,"I watched this series periodically over the years.  Because of my schedule I just could get to see most of the episodes. It's such a priviledge to own the entire series on DVD.  I watched the entire series over a month or so and it was just so great to see the great writing, acting, and thought (controversial subject topics) that went into every episode.  I wish it would have gone on even longer.
There were so many episodes that I often re-watch them because they are so good.",1287619200,,480,4.370786516853933
