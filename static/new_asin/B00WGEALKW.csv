7132088,5,B00WGEALKW,"We've waited a long time for them, but your favorite bad guy mutant warthog and rhinoceros duo is back! Bebop (Anton Zeck) and Rocksteady (Ivan Steranko), new members of Shredder's henchmen, are on the scene and have a bone to pick with the Turtles.",1434153600,4,249,4.681818181818182

7132092,5,B00WGEALKW,"As I've said in the other reviews for this show they are great.  We don't have cable and with these it's easy to pop it in and play on demand.  We had the earlier episodes and needed to find out what happened.  They have great story lines, good enough to get adults involved and watching.  Overall good fun for the family.",1453075200,,322,4.229508196721311

7132097,5,B00WGEALKW,We love The Turtles!  My only complaint is that I miss Jason Biggs as the voice for Leo.  I have a difficult time not hearing Seth Green whenever Leo talks.  It feels misplaced to me.,1447718400,,183,4.171428571428572

7132103,5,B00WGEALKW,"The show still knows how to entertain the audience, I still kinda wish The Finger became Rocksteady instead, that guy was short enough and dumb enough to be a talking rhino mutant. Ivan Steranko had more to offer as a character as well, but I guess the developers didn't know what to do with a weapons dealer in a kids' show. Other than that, the series was (like I said) fantastic!",1442534400,,382,4.394366197183099

7132106,5,B00WGEALKW,"This show is actually REALLY good for someone like me (late 20s)... Pays homage to the original... Slight variations, but the variations are easy to accept with the plot being so heavily mirrored to the 1987 series",1439510400,3,214,4.8108108108108105

7132108,5,B00WGEALKW,"I bought this for my four year old son and he was really happy. He missed the episodes with bebop and rocksteady on Nick, so he is really happy to see them now. The price was great and shipping was fast. I would definitely buy again.",1438560000,2,233,4.086956521739131
7132109,5,B00WGEALKW,"Growing up with the original TMNT cartoon in the 80s/90s, I'll admit I was first leary about this series. However, I gave it a shot and quickly enjoyed it. They pay homage to not only the original cartoon but also the comics and the first few movies from the early 90s. The shout-outs to the original series are awesome and the fact they incorporate some of the older characters is great. I bought all the DVD sets thus far of the Nickelodeon series at the store but this one I bought online the day it came out. My fiancee and I both watch this and we were anticipating this set. We were not disappointed and we're now eagerly anticipating the next set.",1437955200,,654,4.368852459016393
