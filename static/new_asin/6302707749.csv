7829839,5,6302707749,This great 80's movie needs to be on blu-Ray. One of those they would show back in the late night days of Cinemax. New guy in town parents run the motel. Meets friends who talk him into letting use a room to brings girls to. Of course they get caught. It has it laughs fans of 80's movies should enjoy it.,1479254400,,305,4.016393442622951

7829841,5,6302707749,"We rented this, first-run, at Blockbuster Video, and recall thinking 'it sure looks good!'. It appeared to be a take on Porky's or Fast Times, and the cover was great:  A good looking teenage boy (my age) glancing back at two sunbathing girls  -  and then of course reading the back cover: No big star names, but who cared?
This movie stood on its own.

For more an Indie release in its day, it is by far one of the very best 80's long-forgotten teen flicks. I put it up there with the likes of Ferris Bueller, Pretty in Pink, and Spring Break (another almost forgotten 80's flick). The action is dead-on with mostly unknowns WHO CAN ACT. And I don't list it B-movie quality. It is FAR above that level. It certainly could have been a cinematic release (if it was). I love it for the plot line, the excellent acting, and the location shooting.

And also, for all you J.J. Cohen and Gary Hershberger fans out there -  this was their first major film.

Enough said.",1275523200,,963,4.376404494382022

7829843,4,6302707749,"I remember seeing this movie when it was released in 1985. It's a cute story about a guy that moves with his parents to California. Upon arriving at a new school, his classmates soon discover that his Dad runs the Paradise Motel, ""get a free lei with every stay""...this movie could only be pulled off in the '80s! It's cheesy, none of the actors are recognizable & it's a total 'B' movie but it has a lot of charm. Even though this movie has been largely forgotten, & if you like obscure '80s teen comedies, then this one is a good choice.",1027468800,7,539,4.294117647058823
