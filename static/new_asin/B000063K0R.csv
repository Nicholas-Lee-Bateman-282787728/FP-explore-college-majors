7959235,3,B000063K0R,"For me, this movie wasn't as bad as other reviewers think it was. I watched it knowing it would be a ""B"" movie, I wasn't expecting anything more than that. For a ""B"" movie it was enjoyable, not great but not terrible. I bought the VHS for cheap and don't regret it, I got my money's worth. If anyone's interested the soundtrack CD is also available on Amazon with music by Cul De Sac. :-)

P.S. also if you're interested in Constantine Maroulis, he plays a police assistant and is in the movie twice, each time for less than a minute. He does speak a few lines and with a Boston accent.",1434412800,,586,4.232142857142857

7959237,2,B000063K0R,"I bought this because Constantine Maroulis was in it. If that's why anyone else is buying it, then don't bother. He is in it about 10 seconds.  And I had to rewind a few times to realize it was him.  He looks totally different, with short hair! Otherwise the movie itself was alright, but probably will never watch it again.",1271635200,3,324,4.383333333333334
7959238,1,B000063K0R,"this was a good strangler story,but theres way to much nudity.even though its a great strangler movie that depicts the boston strangler or summer of sam.im sorry,call me old fashioned,but there was way to much nudity in this movie for me to watch,so my rating on this student film is a  (1)...bookowl..",1188864000,,302,4.8076923076923075
7959239,2,B000063K0R,"It was so hard to follow this movie to me it was like a student film but I couldn't be sure. I couldn't really hear or follow the script,but eventually close to middle of the movie to the end it began to get a bit better. Different and odd type of movie if you like a movie with consistent strangling going on,lol.",1116028800,2,314,4.080645161290323
7959240,2,B000063K0R,"Somewhere in this muddled mess of a movie could have been an interesting and provocative thriller.  As it is, the script is so convoluted and no reason is really given for strangler Kevin's actions.  Waifish Mae was rescued from sexual abuse by Kevin and they got married and obviously they both are having some sexual hangups.  Mae thinks security guard hubby is having an affair; he's actually out strangling working class women.  Mae develops a friendship with fellow art student Elena, which has some serious sexual tension.  Director Michael Allosso doesn't handle the suspense element as well as he should have.  Again, in a movie where we know right away who the killer is, you have to have a dynamite script and cast to keep an audience involved.  We have neither here.  Sarah Huling as Mae is so ambivalent and lethargic, we can't develop much sympathy for her.  Ciaran Crawford does a little better in showing us both his sweet and sensitive side as well as his violent nature.  Christy Scott Cashman as Elena exudes a certain sexual tension but her best friend role is too cliche to be concerned with.

THE STRANGLER'S WIFE has the look and feel of a student film, and the credits' abundance of apprentices would support that.  If this is the case, hopefully the students have learned from this mishap and can do better in the future.",1107475200,,1345,4.75
