8710963,1,B00VQRFE1G,"The story is the most unlikely I have seen in a long time. And the film is made for as little money as possible. The cirkus-dressed indians ride and ride and yell and yell and the soldiers and pioneers lie behind shelter and shoot and shoot. It is like two different films put together. I like director Lesley Selander but it is as if he doesn't care about directing this film. That leaves the else solid Sterling Hayden on his own. His talk, his gestures and everything is amatourish overplayed. The fifties were filled with good westerns but this one is ridiculous! The print is sometimes all right and sometimes grainy!",1437091200,,622,4.612612612612613
8710964,5,B00VQRFE1G,"Very good western  Sterling Hayden is in the  U S Army and is on the run  He finds out that the Indians  are on the war path,  through coming across is cousin who is dieing from his wounds he takes is cousin name and helps the US Army and the wagon train. In the mean time there is trouble arising in the camp  that where the action starts to the finish.  On time delivery from Amazon.  Recommended.",1436918400,3,399,4.090909090909091
