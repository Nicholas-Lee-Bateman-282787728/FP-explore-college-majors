7855153,5,6303929680,"Genie is my favorite character in the whole series.  So it's great we get a tape focusing on him, especially since it has 2 incredibly good episodes.

Sneeze The Day:  There's just one thing Genie is allergic to, guava juice!  And until Genie stops sneezing up dangers like two-headed dragons, all of Argrabah is in chaos!  So Aladdin & Iago must take a mysterious journey to search for Genie's cure!  A hilarious & exciting episode.  A+

Genie Hunt: The ferocious genie hunter Muktar takes Genie away from Aladdin.  It's only through the power of trust that Genie & Aladdin prove their friendship is stronger than the forces of deceit.  The Muktar is one of the best villains in the whole series.  A+

So keep a special eye out for this tape, if you have a VCR.  Yeah I really want the series on DVD too, but until then, where else can I get my fix?  And besides, the VHS format will never die, for me at least.",1365465600,2,912,4.383233532934132

PLEASE don't mixed up with ""Genie Hunt"" and ""The Hunted"". Worth the money if you want to watch it a couple of times.",994896000,5,236,4.386363636363637
