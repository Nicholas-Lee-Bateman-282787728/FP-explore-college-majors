2383513,5,B000AABKGI,"I was so angry when MTV pulled this show off TV, it was one of their best animated shows ever. DAMN MTV!!! but thankfully someone found this television jewel and put it on DVD, so buy it now....",1132963200,11,194,4.131578947368421
2383514,5,B000AABKGI,"Hilarious show that should have lasted longer than it did! Was very disappointed when MTV pulled the plug on the show.
I think you should watch a couple of episodes on YouTube and when you realize how genius the show is you will want to buy it and have it for
yourself.",1475107200,,269,4.1923076923076925
2383515,5,B000AABKGI,Amazing show. Super funny,1467504000,,25,5.5
2383516,5,B000AABKGI,A great show. Taken off the air way too early.,1462320000,,46,3.7
2383517,5,B000AABKGI,"This a very funny show. I purchased the DVD because I could NOT find it anywhere else.

It is just as funny as I remembered and it is cool that all the actors in it are now on other tv shows.

A must for any cartoon lover, but not suitable for all ages.",1452643200,,253,3.7547169811320753
2383518,5,B000AABKGI,Great show. Sad I can't get the fabled second season,1452038400,,52,4.3
2383519,5,B000AABKGI,This came in perfect condition.  I watched two episodes right away.  It brought me back to the college days of watching this.  It's still entertaining and a bit nostalgic with its  soundtrack and cultural references.,1445904000,,216,5.085714285714285
2383520,5,B000AABKGI,"I bought this in 2009. It's now 2015 and I'm still watching these DVDs and laughing. Most of the episodes are on Youtube, but if you're a fan I think it's worth purchasing.",1443052800,,172,4.242424242424242
2383521,5,B000AABKGI,"One of the best shows ever to be cancelled in its first season. The characters are lovable, there are so many jokes  it's worth watching for sure.",1441065600,,146,4.407407407407407
2383522,5,B000AABKGI,too bad they didn't make season 2 -- one of the greatest MTV shows ever,1437696000,,71,3.8
2383523,5,B000AABKGI,It's a DVD. What do you want?,1435795200,,29,3.2857142857142856
2383524,5,B000AABKGI,Amazing show. Amazing service. I feel that sums it up quite nicely.,1434240000,,67,4.666666666666667
2383525,5,B000AABKGI,"I'll admit I'd never heard of this show until I read about on Cracked.  This is an insanely funny cartoon that ran very briefly on MTV.  This is a show that grabs classic teen drama tropes and beats the stuffing out of them.  There's usually a moral to the story that makes very little sense, a pointless love triangle, and a vague sense of doom as our heroes are being used - somehow - by a shadowy government organization.

I've read that it was cancelled because it made the clone of Ghandi into a short, obnoxious party animal.  I can't help but wonder if the Kennedys didn't make a few calls after seeing JFK as a horndog reprobate.

Remember, people, don't smoke raisins.  And throw your trash away into a proper receptacle.  And don't flip the pool over and set it on fire.",1430784000,,780,4.405594405594406
2383526,5,B000AABKGI,Just as good as I remember it,1430697600,,29,3.2857142857142856

2383530,5,B000AABKGI,Finally I can watch this great show. The sound and video quality are good as well as the few extra features. Though I wish there were more.,1418083200,,139,4.185185185185185
2383531,5,B000AABKGI,"My son's purchase.  He is very happy with it.

2383533,5,B000AABKGI,great product,1413590400,,13,6.0
2383534,5,B000AABKGI,"I wished this show had lasted more then one season. Its very funny, smart and clever to have clones of historic figures as teenagers, growing up and facing awkwardness/ problems/identity, as we all have in high school. The music is awesome too.",1403136000,,244,4.833333333333333
2383535,5,B000AABKGI,"Hilarious.  Didn't last on TV very long, but definitely one of the best cartoon shows of the late nineties/early 00s when they were in their heyday.",1397520000,,148,4.6923076923076925
2383536,5,B000AABKGI,"If you like owning awesome things, you will love owning this.

It makes any DVD shelf 34% more sexuallly attractive.",1393459200,,116,4.8
2383537,5,B000AABKGI,"How I wish this show had been more successful! When this show originally aired, I was in high school, and my comedy friends and I were immediately obsessed. The show's plot, stay with me, is that a shadowy government agency, dug up the bodies of famous people, cloned them, and now they're all attending high school. The principal, Cinnamon J. Scudworth, and his robot butler, Mr. Butlertron see over/scheme over the student body that consists of: JFK, Abraham Lincoln, Cleopatra, and Catherine the Great (or should I say, Catherine the So-So) among many others. None of these historic characters are anything like they were in real life. Except, maybe JFK's womanizing ways. Was Mahatma Gandhi really a party animal?

Every episode is memorable, with plenty of scenes to learn to quote verbatim. Enjoy!",1386547200,,803,5.037593984962406
2383538,4,B000AABKGI,Loved the show. DVD is great. Only thing I don't like is that there is an intro that you have to go through (can't skip it) every single time you put the first DVD in.,1376870400,,167,3.8
2383539,5,B000AABKGI,"How do I describe Clone High? Take those silly 90's teen dramas and cast teen versions (clones) of historical figures and hilarity ensues. A lot of the jokes do rely on the audience being pop-culturally aware in the 90's so it's probably only funny to those of us who are in our mid 20's to early 30's right now. Clone High is regularly quoted in my household, we love it.",1375574400,,372,4.328571428571428
2383540,5,B000AABKGI,I came across this show by accident one day on MTV. I only watched that one episode and I was hooked. Sadly it was around the time that MTV for some odd reason pulled off this great show. I ended up finding some of the episodes on YouTube. I was glad to find out that they have put this show  on DVD. This is one series that I HIGHLY recommend  for everyone. They only complaint that I have is their is no season 2.,1375228800,,415,3.9285714285714284
2383541,5,B000AABKGI,"I looked for this show for years (literally) and finally found it on Amazon.  So glad I bought it, have been missing this gem for a while.",1373068800,,138,4.111111111111111
2383542,5,B000AABKGI,"Watched these online before and found them funny, now I get to watch them whenever in better quality.  Glad this was available.",1373068800,,127,4.7727272727272725
2383543,5,B000AABKGI,"Don't watch this if you're expecting something like those Hannah-Barbera cartoons in the sixties. I only hope someone makes the decision to make more of this. Maybe in Canada, because they could never get away with a lot of the stuff in this in the states.",1371945600,,256,4.586956521739131
2383544,5,B000AABKGI,"At risk of hyperbole, this is simply one of the finest shows to grace television in the past 20 years. A decade ahead of its time and on the wrong network, it never got the time to breathe and become a long-running staple a la The Simpsons. Clone High is a sharp, witty, and insanely quotable. Just check out the other reviews. Those who honestly give this show a chance fall in love with it. And justly so.",1368403200,,407,4.230769230769231
2383545,4,B000AABKGI,"I enjoyed this show a lot when I was in college, I really wish they would have made just one more season, but it is definitely aimed for that16-24 year old demographic.",1367884800,,168,4.28125
2383546,5,B000AABKGI,"Not gonna spoil it, but this is just top-notch comedy writing and performance. It fits together perfectly, and just plain works. Wish there was more of it!",1361318400,,155,4.777777777777778
2383547,5,B000AABKGI,"So many clever references in this show.  I love how each historical figure translated into a typical high school persona, but with a twist.  It's when you spot cariactures of the ratpack or hear about JFK sleeping with ""Catherine-the-Not-So-Great"" that I get the giggles and end up watching another episode when I thought I could just watch one.",1358985600,,345,4.931034482758621
2383548,5,B000AABKGI,"Clone high is the greatest show in the history of ever what more can I say... Weasley..

buy and share the glory.",1356825600,,113,4.136363636363637
2383549,5,B000AABKGI,If you know this show that is probably why you are here and don't need me to tell you how good it is. If you are new then buy it! It is fun and never slows down. Unfortunately there is only one season.,1354924800,,201,3.697674418604651
2383550,5,B000AABKGI,"This was my favorite show when I was in 8th Grade, I quoted it all the time. So I was thrilled to find a DVD available now so I can see how it holds up now that I'm an adult.

The show is even better than it was when I was a kid, or should I say that my understanding of the jokes are better. It went from being my favorite show then to my favorite cartoon now.

I won't bore you with a plot summary, you can find that online anywhere, and other reviews have given you the gist of it. I will say that it's a fantastic parody of the teen dramas of the time it was released so if you didn't grow up with those shows then this show might be lossed on you. However, the cleverness of it is for everyone. Some jokes are definitely gone with the days (Bubba Sparxxx references and a whole episode devoted to a member of O-Town), but overall anyone who enjoys [adult swim] will find themselves angry that this show is discontinued and not on there.",1335916800,,941,4.053763440860215
2383551,5,B000AABKGI,"This is the funniest cartoon I have ever seen! Not for children, but adults will love this zany show. You will want to watch it over and over.",1335312000,,142,4.107142857142857
2383552,5,B000AABKGI,"Originally bought this for a friend as a present because he talked about enjoying it when it ran on MTV years back, and it became one of my all time favorite television shows ever. This might be the most consistently funny cartoon I have ever seen. The characters are fun takes on their historical figures (I especially enjoy Gandhi's brief rap career) and a great assortment of guest stars playing off of their own images like Marilyn Manson, possibly Mandy Moore, and Ashley Angel of O-Town! It sadly only lasted one season, and SPOILER ALERT ends on a cliffhanger that will most likely never be resolved. The special features are lackluster, but this set is definitely worth it just for the show alone. Seriously, buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed.",1322352000,2,760,4.765151515151516
2383553,5,B000AABKGI,"This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen, too bad it only had one season.  Many comedy shows take a while to build up their characters, but episode one gets right to the point.  Many of the comedians in this show are well known from SNL and Mad TV, so it's like the best of both worlds.  The music is catchy too.  The themes are definitely not for kids.  I'm not sure why Adult Swim never picked up this show since it is much funnier than the last 6 seasons of Family Guy.  Some comedies become really dated based on their material, but each episode of Clone High is based on everyday issues that never get old.

The only annoying this about this DVD is the menu option - you can't get to the episodes right away, even if you hit menu it won't let you skip ahead.  Why do companies feel we need to watch 10 previews and warn us about copy rights for the hundredth time?",1315180800,4,877,4.117647058823529
2383554,5,B000AABKGI,This is the best animated series ever. I found it originally on Youtube and fell in love with it. I'm so pissed that it's cancelled. The show is a comedy blendin slapstick and paroding teen dramas. the cast itself is enough to make you laugh. the DVD is in great condition by it and maybe just maybe the show will come back.,1299542400,,324,4.241935483870968
2383555,5,B000AABKGI,"This is the last good show that MTV ever made. Unfortunately, they only lasted one season; by the time it aired, MTV's audience had become too stupid to keep this show afloat. Suffice to say that the show is excellent, and nonstop laughs. It is very clever, and I have purchased a copy for myself, and continue to purchase more, to give out as gifts for xmas and birthdays.",1295913600,,373,4.420289855072464
2383556,5,B000AABKGI,"Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Too bad it was only one season, but it features a bunch of incredibly hilarious people:  Will Forte (SNL, 30 Rock, MacGruber); Michael McDonald (MADtv); Nicole Sullivan (MADtv, $#*! My Dad Says, Scrubs, Family Guy) and several more.

If you like ""Scrubs,"" you'll find almost the whole cast at Clone High with the exception of Zach Braff.",1295395200,,373,5.15
2383557,5,B000AABKGI,"Loved this show eight years ago, still loving it now.  It is very tongue in cheek, literally and figuratively.  I can't decide if my favorite episode is ""Litter Kills"" or ""Makeover, Makeover, Makeover: The Makeover Episode.""  They're both so awesome.  Buy it, watch it, love it.  It's amazing.",1286668800,,293,5.020833333333333
2383558,5,B000AABKGI,DVD made it quickly and in good shape. So glad to be able to watch this show again.,1279756800,,83,3.6666666666666665
2383559,5,B000AABKGI,"amazing cartoon. hilarious characters, ridiculous plot lines, it definitely has its own brand of humor. too bad it got cut short by a bunch of butthurt Indians that raged over the portrayal of Gandhi's clone. what a waste. the real Gandhi would have been cool with it.",1270684800,,268,4.723404255319149
2383560,5,B000AABKGI,"This show was on when I was 19 and a soph in college.  I only remember watching 3 episodes, The first one, The extreme blue one, and the ghandi has ADD,  but I thought it was one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  Since I purchased the DVD's, I have shown it to my friends who all think it is great.  Worth every penny.

Now if we could just get the first 2 seasons of Sifl and Olly on DVD, that would be AMAZING.",1266192000,,419,3.8255813953488373

2383562,5,B000AABKGI,"Best investment I've ever made. Watch it over and over and is still funny- just like 'Friends'. Though sadly there's only one season of Clone High
:( Precious it is.",1233014400,2,165,4.533333333333333
2383563,5,B000AABKGI,"How could the powers that be not see the utter genius in this show?  Leave it to Mtv to can something as great as this in favor of dreck like ""My Super Sweet Sixteen.""  They should be ashamed of themselves (well, they should've been ashamed of themselves long before this, but that's besides the point).

Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, Ghandi & JFK (along with a host of others)... cloned... in high school...

Very well-written... great voice casting (Will Forte, Nicole Sullivan, Michael McDonald)... a great show that didn't get a chance, thanks to a once great network that has gone down the pooper.",1231113600,,609,4.771428571428571
2383564,5,B000AABKGI,"This series is SO hilarious. I was so upset when I found out that they cancelled it.

If you watched it religiously like I did when it was airing on MTV, (2004, I believe?) then you won't de dissapointed. In it's short 13 episode run, it had plenty of laughs. You should get this. Hands down. You'll have plenty of quotes that you can share with your friends for weeks to come.",1225670400,,377,4.236111111111111
2383565,5,B000AABKGI,"I have never met a person that didn't think this show was absolutely hilarious. I've watched the series several times and it still makes me laugh out loud. Show it family, show it friends, it will make your life better, as though it were some miracle infomercial product, except Clone High works, like Oxy-Clean.",1223251200,2,312,4.796296296296297
2383566,5,B000AABKGI,I am a huge fan of this show. I was so happy to find it on DVD. I recommend it HIGHLY.,1220313600,,86,3.142857142857143
2383567,5,B000AABKGI,"Clone high is a classic, and probably one of the smartest shows that MTV has ever aired, in contrast to the shallow and inane programming nowadays. Clone high follows several cloned historical figures trying to live up to their reputations, failing miserably. Each episode is a spoof of dramatic teenage drama shows and/or typical after-school teenybopper TV programs.",1198454400,,368,5.362068965517241
2383568,5,B000AABKGI,"This show is great and has so much potential. It is a Canadian show and MTV aired a few episodes, but quickly canceled it. I thought that it was really witty, and was so disappointed when they canceled it in the States.",1198281600,,219,4.238095238095238
2383569,5,B000AABKGI,"I have waited so long for Clone High to come on DVD. I am so happy to see that it is finally happening! I'm sure I have more intelligent things to say about the show, but my heart is filled with so much joy and I just can't put it all into words. All I can say is WATCH THIS SHOW!",1197244800,,280,3.6065573770491803
2383570,5,B000AABKGI,I haven't even bought these DVD's yet but I totally recommend it. I came across Clone High on late night Canadian adult cartoons. Clone High is definitely one of the funniest out there!,1191628800,,185,4.636363636363637
2383571,5,B000AABKGI,"This series was such a breathe of fresh air in a time of stale animated shows.  The use of the famous historical figures as characters for the show is brilliant and the way each of them is portrayed is great.  Each of them displays the characteristics of stereotypical roles in teen movies/shows but never loses the tongue-in-cheek quality to them.  If you like some of the stuff coming out of Adult Swim now-a-days, I recommend you check this series out.",1179187200,,455,4.6625
2383572,5,B000AABKGI,This is the most hilarious show I have ever seen...well maybe not that funny but still pretty damned good.  I have already been through all the episodes about 15 times since I got it a couple of weeks ago.  Say whaaaaaaat?!,1173312000,2,223,4.414634146341464

great transaction again!!",1168300800,,99,5.1875
2383580,5,B000AABKGI,"Not only does this show brilliantly satirize those treacly teen dramas, it's genuinely better than them at their own game.  I think I was more interested in the Abe/Joan angle than I ever have been in any comparable ""will they/won't they"" dynamic from serious shows.  Too bad the resolution is lost along with season two.  Oh, well, maybe someday I'll run into one of the writers at a bar or something.  That notwithstanding, I highly recommend this show to anybody interested in pitch-perfect parody.

Also, the ""Raisins"" episode.  You'll see.",1148428800,5,544,4.988888888888889
2383581,5,B000AABKGI,"My only problem with this is the 90 second teletoon commercial you can't skip past, the fact that they extended the Clone High intro, they took out the piano acoustic intro for the episode ""Litter Kills, Literally"" and the fact that they didn't include better bounus features like maybe an Abandoned Pools music video for Clone high, over all I'm happy with it, all the original songs were kept in.",1147392000,2,398,4.7
2383582,5,B000AABKGI,"The first 3-4 episodes of this show were absolute perfection. The latter episodes are not as tight as the first ones, but they still stand strong.  I'm so happy they finally officially released this.  I purchased an amazing copy on Ebay, of which I am still indebted to the guy who made those copies.  They were near perfect and allowed to get a few of my friends addicted to the show years after it was taken off the air.  I will admit that I wanted more 'behind the scenes' stuff, but once again, we are very lucky we have anything.  This is a great show and probably the best show/cartoon MTV ever put on the air.",1147046400,,616,4.275862068965517
2383583,5,B000AABKGI,"I've waited for three years for this show to be released on DVD.  In that time I've had to make do with the complete series downloaded on my computer.  But now that I have this set, I couldn't be happier.

You may have read how annoying some reviewers find the the 90-second Teletoon commercial introduction to be.  Personally, I don't mind it since it shows scenes from some of my favorite cartoons - Family Guy, Futurama, etc.  Nonetheless, you can't skip past it (at least on my Sony DVD players) - but it's not that bad.

What blew me away was the incredible transfer quality.  I could not believe how sharp and colorful the show looked.  Excellent job with the print, as the image quality looked just like that found on the Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, Family Guy volumes.  In addition, I could not believe how great the audio sounded.  Absolutely no noise.

Regarding the audio, I was so pleased to see that all of the songs that originally aired are on this set.  Clone High has such an incredible selection of songs that I was pleased to see that they were retained.  Dashboard Confessional, The Get Up Kids, Saves the Day, Taking Back Sunday, Hot Rod Circuit, The Anniversary, Alkaline Trio - this show is an emo-lovers dream!  Also, it's worth addressing the longer intro song.  Having read about this change, I was prepared to hear it at the beginning of each episode - but I didn't realize how much I'd miss the piano version on Episode 10.  Clone High has such a great theme song, and I missed this variation.  However, a quick search on the internet will show that numerous sites have an mp3 of this song.

Overall, this was an excellent packaging.  I did miss not having any liner notes or some sort of insert in the DVD case - just think how great it would have been to include a retrospective, sketches, etc.  Oh well.  I don't think anything short of a second season will ever satisfy Clone High fans - but I think this release is pretty great.",1144627200,16,1965,4.494350282485875
2383584,5,B000AABKGI,"I was a complete fan of Clone High when MTV orignally aired it oh so many years ago. It was one of the first shows that got me intrested in random humor, much like Family Guy. In fact, this show is up there right next to Family Guy. The show's refrences to sterotypical high school problems and historical refrences made me want more. The best part of this show was that the idea behind in, clones of famous figures in highschool with parents who try to be there for their kids but fail miseriably, was very very orignal and a head of its time, much like family guy. Maybe Cartoon Network will buy the rights to this amazing show and it'll come back from the TV underworld. But untill then, Im so glad that I discovered its on DVD, Im in heaven! And I NEED to know what happened after the flash freezer! Maybe a Clone College spinoff?",1143417600,2,834,4.284810126582278
2383585,5,B000AABKGI,"Clone High, without a question, stands with The Simpsons (and I am talking the 'prime years' of The Simpsons-Seasons 4,5,6) as one of the best animated shows of all-time. The show has some of the greatest characters ever and when they are paired with clever and original writing, you got a winner. Of course, MTV couldn't see this because it didn't have an Osbourne or a Ashlee Simpson involved.  Anyway, anyone that can buy this DVD, do so. It will not disappoint.  Maybe we can pull a Family Guy and get it back on the air. Great show.",1139961600,9,537,4.469387755102041
2383586,5,B000AABKGI,"Clone High has a very original concept; back in the 1980s, secret government agents dug up some of the most famous and influential historical figures and cloned them.  The clones were put in the care of foster homes, and are being secretly monitered by the government.  By now, they are in high school, and are attending Clone High High School, where Principal Cinnamon J. Scudworth (Phil Lord) can keep his eye on them.  Scudworth is employed by the Board of Shadowy Figures, the government group responsible for the clones, but he secretly plans to steal the clones away from the government for his own purposes.  Scudworth is a stereotypical mad scientist; he is completely insane, speaks in an overly dramatic manner, and even built a robotic butler named Mr. Butlertron (Chris Miller).

The main clones are Abe Lincoln (Will Forte), a nice guy who is very indecisive, Joan of Arc (Nicole Sullivan), a goth girl with a crush on Abe, Ghandi (Michael McDonald), Abe's best friend and party animal (he buckled under the pressure of living up to the original Ghandi), Cleopatra (Christa Miller), a sexy, self-absorbed rich girl, and JFK (Chris Miller), a loud, obnoxious, partier who is Lincoln's rival for Cleopatra's heart.  Some other clones include George Washington Carver (Donald Faison), a science nerd obsessed with peanuts, Thomas Edison, an AV nerd, Ponce de Leon (Luke Perry), a Fonzie-esque guy who likes to litter, Vincent van Gogh (Andy Dick), a depressed art student (if you've seen Wedding Crashers, think Todd), and Buddy Holly (Neil Flynn), an aviator with an unsafe plane.  In addition to the numerous clones, there are many original characters such as Toots (Donald Faison), Joan of Arc's blind foster parent, Wally and Carl (Faison, Flynn), JFK's gay foster dads, Abe's Foster Dad (Joe Flarhety), who is kind of a knock on Flarhety's character in Freaks and Geeks, Mr. Sheepman (Andy Dick), a history teacher and the first mostly human clone, and Glenn the Janitor (Flynn), who is Ponce's foster dad and a direct parody of Flynn's Janitor character on Scrubs (Glenn is the exact opposite of the Janitor on Scrubs, but Scudworth still hates him).

The episodes wonderfully poke fun of the teenage drama genre.  The episodes all deal with bizarre ""issues"", such as smoking raisins to get high, corporate sponsorship, the ADD epidemic, religious tolerance, incarceration, and the death of a friend.  In fact, every episode begins with ""Tonight, on a very special Clone High"", and every episode has a ""Previously"" segment and a ""On the next..."" segment, neither of which are necessary, because the show isn't (for the most part) serialized.  Futhermore, the relationship structure is similar to that of most popular teen dramas; the male protagonist (Abe) likes the sexy girl (Cleo) who is dating a jerk (JFK), while his best female friend (Joan) pines for him.  Meanwhile, Abe's best male friend (Ghandi), is always trying to score with the girls, though he usually ends in failure.  The animation is somewhat crude, though I think that it is (1) part of the show's charm, and (2) another way to poke fun at generic teen shows.  I think that the cheap animation is supposed to make us think that this was a kind of quick imitation.

A lot of the humor on the show derives from the fact that so many of the clones are nothing like the originals.  Abe is indecisive, JFK is not a good leader, Ghandi is a party animal, Ghengis Khan is mentally challenged, and Nostradamus is a terrible psychic.  Of course, there are numerous other kinds of jokes, ranging from current events references (such as the extreme marketing), great guest stars (including Marilyn Manson, Jack Black, John Stamos, and Mandy Moore), and parodies of classic cartoons, such as when Scudworth engaged in a Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote scenario with a skunk.  Also, a lot of the humor is similar to that found on the show Scrubs, which makes sense because Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence is one of the creators of Clone High.  And with the exception of Judy Reyes and Ken Jenkins, all of the Scrubs regulars did voices in this show.  Also, a lot of guest stars on Scrubs also appeared in this show, sometimes as regulars (Nicole Sullivan, who does the voice of Joan of Arc, had a somewhat recurring role on Scrubs).

Sadly, Clone High was cancelled after only one season.  There was so much more they could have done, and so much humor to be had with yet-to-be introduced clones.  It's sad that we'll never get to see the exploits of Abe and Ghadi or hear Mr. Butlertron call anyone Wesley again, but oh well.  The show ended in a ""cliff-hanger"" which further parodied the teen drama.  It's actually a pretty fitting ending for the type of show that Clone High is.  Who knows, maybe someday we'll get a movie, similar to Firefly, but for now, enjoy these 13 episodes.",1139356800,66,4848,4.846060606060606
2383587,5,B000AABKGI,"What an amazing and funny show, much like Arrested Development and Family Guy (just to name the obvious) it didn't make it.  Family guy has rebounded. Clone High ended way to early to have a chance to do anything.  Regardless, I really want to have these episodes at home to enjoy, it's a fun way to see western adolescent culture roles intertwined with some of histories must influential and important people.  Original and funny, pretty well Why it didn't have a chance.",1136332800,3,472,4.7317073170731705

8076929,5,B000AABKGI,"Though I somehow missed this 13-episode series during its 2002-03 run on MTV -- it was co-created by Bill Lawrence and featured several actors from his show 'Scrubs,' one of my very favorites at the time -- I eventually binged it on Youtube after having seen 'Nebraska' and been inspired to check out more of Will Forte's work outside of SNL (oddly enough, as much as I had liked him during his 2002-2010 run on that show, as well as his run as Jenna's love-interest on '30 Rock,' I hadn't really tried to find out more about him before), and after MTV Classic re-aired the series last year, I got the first (and only) season DVD set for Christmas. Bizarre stuff -- the teen characters are all clones of important historical figures living out banal everyday dramas -- but the voice work, including co-creators Phil Lord (as maniacal Principal Scudworth and a Genghis Khan clone) and Chris Miller (as robot butler Mr. Butlertron and horn-dog student JFK), is hysterical; and though my experience with teen soaps is somewhat limited, the Very Special Episode goofs are hilariously dead-on. Highlights include the anti-drug musical ""Raisin the Stakes: A Rock Opera in 3 Acts,"" ""Litter Kills: Literally"" (guest-starring 'Beverley Hills, 90210' alum Luke Perry), and ""Snowflake Day"" (featuring Mandy Moore in a role similar to the ""homeless angel"" Juliana Hatfield played on the Christmas episode of 'My So-Called Life').",1505260800,,1417,5.008474576271187
