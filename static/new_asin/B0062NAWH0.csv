4933174,1,B0062NAWH0,"Mia Wasikowska (Alice in Tim Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND) gives a subtle and delicate performance but she is left high and dry in this otherwise tedious and endlessly irritating romance about dying in the midst of life and living in the midst of death.  This indulgent, muddled and maudlin weepy is so contrived that it fails to come to life.  Unexpected moments of unintentional comedy abound and if you laugh out loud, rest assured, it doesn't mean you are a bad person with a cold heart. Gus Van Sant directs, but here he's at his worst.  It's interesting to watch Dennis Hopper's son Henry in the co-starring role.  But he should not include this on his reel, assuming he survives the spotlight of dating Lindsay Lohan - a big talent for whom we are rooting.",1332979200,,763,4.62962962962963
4933175,3,B0062NAWH0,"`Restless' is one of those movies that starts off really awkward.  It doesn't really `begin' as much as it just `starts'.  It just kind of drops you in the laps of the protagonists and leaves you wondering what kind of odd, strange, bizarre film you've got yourself into watching for at least ten minutes.  Then, somewhat magically, it all starts to separate and clear and next thing you know you're watching something with a unique charm and visual personality.

This is far from perfect, but there is an air on imperfection in nearly all of Gus's work.

`Restless' tells the story of a young girl dying of cancer who falls in love with a young boy who's suffering with the loss of his parents.  He is coping by conversing with the ghost of a Japanese kamikaze pilot and he's horribly socially awkward, but they are kindred spirits in that they are calmly walking towards death while the rest of the world around them tries to emote something over everything.  As they come to terms with the fast approaching death, they fall farther in love and begin to heal in many ways.

The initial plot is somewhat hokey and regurgitated of a lot of teen sob romance stories.  It sounds a little Nicolas Sparks, but it has a deadpan charm that is achieved from Gus's directorial choices.  Mia Wasikowska is such a fresh find, and her performance here is delightful and honest and very moving when needed.  Henry Hopper is less successful (he comes across almost high in a lot of scenes and fails to deliver when necessary).  He actually lets the weaknesses in the script (that breakdown with the doctor in particular) get the better of his performance.  He can't rise above.  I find it sad that the script is a tad shallow in that it never really `goes there' even though it hints a lot to attempting to.  The inclusion of the ghost was a nice touch, and it truly added a depth that could have been explored but at least made an impact, but in the end this film feels too light for its own good.

In the end, I'd recommend it, but not for all.  If you are a devotee in the Nicolas Sparks era of teen romance films then steer clear, because the flat lined emotions will irritate you, but if you want to see a different take on that overplayed genre then try Gus's take.

Gus has always had a way with making the melodramatic feel oddly cold.",1329782400,3,2330,4.468085106382978
4933176,5,B0062NAWH0,"Ever since 'forever', I have been a fan of the director of this film, Gus Van Sant.  He is to able to lift up a relationship piece between the younger set while drawing, at the proper times, heart-wrenching and directly palpable emotion from it.  Van Sant had me wanting to know these two vastly different people and their personalities from the very beginning. He then presented their stories in a believable, concerning and curious way.

In the film ""Restless"", Enoch (Henry Hopper) and Annabel (Mia Wasikowska) are the two young leads.  They meet up in the oddest of places and situations appearing to be immediately intrigued by the other.  You could say that Enoch is brooding and dark while he constantly questions what life is all about.  At the same time, breezy and lovely Annabel is imaginative, almost ethereal, and at peace with her own world.  She is a self-proclaimed ""Naturalist"" and believes that there is nothing beyond our existence here and now.

Enoch has great cause to believe the way that he does as does Annabel. Albeit, though, he dons black and views the world as an extremely faulted place while passing through his life.  The always soothing Annabel tries to view the world through the approach of Darwinism while idolizing his theories and is always interested in all the science, nature and biology that surrounds her.  This also includes Enoch as these two unlikely sorts do fall in love with each other.  Their developing unique love story has you questioning while watching it unfold.  These two different viewpoints may clash at first blush. With a little time and a lot of personal interest, this couple takes on an almost magical feel.  This film doesn't pull punches in the direction of one's feelings as I had much empathy with these characters.  Annabel, along with her own intense situation and combined with Enoch's also, is as provocative throughout.  Add to the couple Enoch's very mysterious Japanese friend and sidekick Hiroshi (Chin Han) then we have more of that blend of realism and fantasy.  What is real to them happily is how the film's storyline comes across.

This film is a character study of two very different people who are able to blend into each other for a time.  The music (Danny Elfman) is absolutely lovely while scoring the film. Every song selection is well appreciated and makes sense.  I found this movie extremely enjoyable, although neither always bright by any means nor happy at all times. These two are dealing with some very hard and pertinent issues at younger ages which can be an eye-opening part of life in this sentimentally themed plot.  I loved their story through the realizations, acceptances, and even the tears.  Their story does make a statement about life and how we live it while remaining realistic with its overflowing amount of heart-tugging content. I was relieved that their relationship was never treated sophomorically or wallowed in some sort of pity as a whole as it could have. I more so could appreciate the story's due amount of maturity which it portrays.

4933177,3,B0062NAWH0,"THIS REVIEW INCLUDES MINOR SPOILORS

""Restless,"" Gus Van Sant's follow-up to a bio-pic ""Milk,"" is a quirky film, to say the least. It is a love romance, but not exactly about love itself. Death plays a more significant role in the story, but its presence here is like a metaphor. The film has some touching moments (with Mia Wasikowska's nuanced acting as the heroine), but its drama is more sensitive (if not sentimental) than emotional. The plotline itself is a very familiar one, but not without some unconventional ideas, like a Japanese ghost appears, who just doesn't look like one (he can speak to the hero Enoch and even hit him in the face).

Meet Enoch Brae (Henry Hopper, son of Dennis Hopper), a death-obsessed boy in black who is often seen attending complete stranger's funerals. At one of these funerals he meets a teenage girl named Annabel Cotton (Mia Wasikowska, ""Alice in Wonderland""), who is diagnosed as terminally ill with cancer.

In the meanwhile, because of a near-death experience, Enoch can see a ""ghost"" of a Japanese kamikaze pilot Hiroshi Takahashi (Ryo Kase, ""Letters from Iwo Jima"") who died during the WWII. Enoch and Hiroshi are like friends, playing the game Battleship, but Hiroshi has something to say to Enoch, who seems to refuse facing the fact that Annabel is going away.

In Gus Van Sant's newest film time is apparently set in today's America, but if I remember correctly, there is no cellphone or internet. With its timeless theme such as life and death, the film is clearly trying to be thought-provoking as well as romantic. It almost succeeds thanks to Mia Wasikowska's effective performance as Annabel who quietly accepts her fate, but the rest of the film does not allow us to know much about other characters and their minds.

Supporting players include Schuyler Fisk as Annabel's sister, and Jane Adams as Enoch's aunt. The film's producers include Brian Grazer, Bryce Dallas Howard and Ron Howard. The script is penned by Jason Lew (his debut as a writer). The original music is by Danny Elfman. The atmospheric photography is by Harris Savides (""Milk"" ""Zodiac"").

Perhaps the greatest thing about ""Restless"" is Mia Wasikowska's sensitive performance as Annabel. The film's whimsical narrative is appealing to some with nice soundtrack music, but whether or not you find it charming or boring depends on your taste.",1328140800,,2367,4.9646464646464645
4933178,1,B0062NAWH0,"Gus Van Sant has seen his share of success over the years, but every once in a while, as with most all directors, he misfires. Such was the case with his latest film, Restless, a tale of unlikely teen romance that quietly breezed through theaters back in September. Based on a play by the film's screenwriter, Jason Lew, Restless continues the tradition of twee indie romances, complete with quirky affectations and random plot elements. Mia Wasikowska is Annabel Cotton, a terminal cancer patient with a fascination for nature and Charles Darwin. Henry Hopper plays Annabel's love interest, Enoch, who's lost his parents in a car accident and entertains visits from the ghost of a Kamikaze pilot named Hiroshi. Together, Annabel and Enoch learn to cope with the hands they've been dealt, all the while with Annabel's imminent passing looming over their heads. Unfortunately, Waskikowska's performance was about the only thing I found to like about the film, so unless alternately cutesy and melancholy love stories are your thing, you won't get much out of Restless.",1328054400,,1067,5.102857142857143
4933179,1,B0062NAWH0,"I hate giving any movie by Gus Van Sant a bad review, because he is one of the VERY few Americans who is capable of making truly great movies.

But - unfortunately for movie lovers - he has bills to pay, and his best movies are never blockbusters. So sometimes, just for the money, he takes on crap that is beyond even his ability to turn into a watchable movie.

The two stars of this one - and the tiresome screenplay - are just too irritating to watch.

I do not see much of a plot (guy meets girl, does stupid stuff, and girl dies in the end, as expected). Perhaps it was meant to be a commentary of some kind? Little forward progress and an exploration? (In this case, of death, our mortality, maturation, ect).
  Personally, I'm not a fan of this movie. It was fine the first time around, but I would not want to see it again. I think it was the male main character that put me off. I can't tell if his acting was poor, or if he's actually doing a great job and it's just the character that I hate so much. I can not stand his whining throughout the movie. It's like he never grew up. Even at the end of the movie he was still childish and awkward. Extremely awkward.

4933206,4,B0062NAWH0,"Warning - spoilers ahead - it's very hard to review this film without talking about at least some of the plot.

Firstly the not so good stuff: 'Restless' is a love-story, but sometimes you get the feeling it's more about love-story archetypes than real characters.  Hopper plays a young man traumatised by his past, though at times I don't get a good sense of his personality behind his odd exterior.  Likewise, we don't really get much insight into the past of Anabelle's character (Mia Wasikowska) beyond what makes her unusual (eg her dying of cancer, or her unusual interest in biology).  It's as though the writer decided to create characters who are symbolically opposite to each other (one obsessed with death, the other with life; one's dying physically, the other one's emotionally 'dead'; the classic pursuer-distancer relationship etc etc) and didn't spend as much time fleshing these archetypes out.  Another nuisance was that for most of the film I was convinced Hiroshi was purely a result of Hopper being mentally not quite well - you then realise that the only way for the story to make sense is to allow for the supernatural - that Hiroshi actually is a ghost.  This is fine as a fable, but not the tightest of storytelling.  The supporting characters are even flimsier, and generally serve only as plot devices.  It's a shame because we could have learnt so much more about the main leads if we had more scenes with them with their family etc.

Still I'm going to give this 4stars.  The acting is excellent, and the emotions evoked powerful.  The ending is predictable but the pleasure is in the recognition of how far the characters (especially Enoch) have come to reach that point.  There are a few memorable cinematographic sequences that are brilliant in being concise - an example is the reveal about Anabelle's cancer - done in a few simple shots without a single word spoken, another example is the 'witch in the woods' sequence where we manage to be drawn into the characters' rich imagination/fantasy world they are creating.

This is definitely worth your time especially if you like love stories, or you could be like me who don't really care much for straight romantic films but still find Restless a charming, quirky fable.",1342915200,,2254,4.838541666666667

4933208,5,B0062NAWH0,"Gus Van Sant probably understands the minds of youngsters better than any director around and he proves it again in this rhapsodic film about loss and love and loss again. His cast is so well selected that they seem to be an ensemble from a stage company, so well integrated are their relationships in this beautiful film written by Jason Lew.

Enoch Brae (Henry Hopper, son of Dennis Hopper, and a very fine actor) survived a car accident in which his parents were killed: he remained in a coma and missed their funeral and the chance to in some way say goodbye. Living with his Aunt Mabel (Jane Adams), he now spends his days not attending school but instead going to strangers' funerals. One funeral organizer (Christopher D. Harder) notices his repeated appearances and tries to have him arrested for trespassing but he is saved by a strange girl named Annabel (Mia Wasikowska in a brilliant performance). Annabel also attends funerals: she tells Enoch that she works with children with cancer at a hospital. Enoch is wary of making friends - his only ally being a Japanese kamikaze pilot ghost Hiroshi Takahashi (Ryo Kase) with whom he talks about everything. But gradually Enoch and Annabel bond and Annabel reveals to Enoch that she doesn't work with `cancer kids', she is one - she has brain cancer and is on short-term time. Annabel's sister Elizabeth (Schyler Fisk) and mother Rachel (Luisa Strus) accept Enoch's growing supportive love for Annabel. As Enoch grows form his experience with Annabel he no longer needs the presence of his ghost or his need for attending funerals and instead spends his time giving Annabel the best three months (remaining) of her life. How the story draws to an end is so enchanting that to share it would deprive the viewer of the magic of this film.

This is one of those perfect little films that glow in the heart. Mia Wasikowska and Henry Hopper create such memorable characters that once seen they will never be forgotten. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp June 12",1339027200,3,2009,4.803468208092486

4933211,4,B0062NAWH0,"Gus Van Sant is known for films such as ""Milk"", """"Good Will Hunting"" but also taking on youth-based films such as ""Elephant"", ""Finding Forrester"", ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""Mala Noche"".

And once again, Van Sant takes on a youth film but this time, a storyline that revolves around ""death"".  Directed by Van Sant and written by Jason Lew, ""Restless"" is a film that stars Mia Wasikowska (Jane Eyre"", ""The Kids Are All Right"", ""Alice in Wonderland""), the film debut of actor Harry Hopper and Ryo Kase (""Tokyo Rendezvous"", ""Letters from Iwo Jima"").

VIDEO:

""Restless"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and for its overall picture quality, while the cinematography by Harris Savides  (""American Gangster"", ""Zodiac"", ""The Game"", ""Milk) is fantastic and one again, utilizing warmer colors, there is a bit of experimentation used by both Savides and also Gus Van Sant in creating this softer look towards the film.  The look of the film is intentional but my perspective of the look of the film sort of matches the quirky relationship between the two protagonists.  Nothing is perfect in their world but yet these two individuals where one is about to die and one was awakened from death are able to come together.  The look is not exactly dream-like but I felt the colors, the softness worked with this type of film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Restless"" is a dialogue driven film but it's also a film with a lot of cool music and also music composed by Danny Elfman (""The Night Before Christmas"", ""Batman"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""The Simpsons"") and another collaboration with Gus Van Sant (as the two have worked together on ""Good Will Hunting"").  While the film does feature ambience during crowd-based scenery and natural environments as both Enoch and Annabel are outdoors with each other near a creek or areas with a lot of vegetation (thus the sounds of insects and birds), the dialogue and music is probably the most dominant piece of this entire film.  I did enjoy the music soundtrack for this film but for the most part, this film is center and front channel driven.

Subtitles are in English and English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Restless"" comes with the following special features:

  Gus Van Sant's Silent Version of Restless - After the completion of filming various scenes of ""Restless"", Van Sant instructed his actors to also do a different version for a silent movie version with intertitles.  Included as a special feature is the silent film version.

EXTRAS:

""Restless"" comes with the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Restless"" is a film that deals with death, understanding and coming to accept it.

In the case of Enoch, a young man who's parents were killed in an accident by a drunk driver and his life was spared, having died for a few minutes and being brought to life, he finds it difficult to understand the concept of death and thus he attends funerals in hopes it would help him come to terms with it.

Annabel is a young woman who has come to terms with her cancer and that she has only three months to live and thus, these two quirky individuals were brought together and essentially, her pending death makes him understand death but also the importance of having memories of one's happier moments.  For Annabel, it's to have someone to share her love and have her first and final romance, no discussion of her death or cancer but to experience that time together.

We are also given a third character, Hiroshi who is more or less, a guardian angel to Enoch and while not implicit that he must help Enoch through his troubled time in order to complete his job, the viewer begins to learn throughout the film that he is more than just a ""ghost"".  There is no explaining by Van Sant of why this character is in the film (or why he speaks perfect English), but fortunately for those who were confused, there is a special feature on the special bond that Enoch and Hiroshi had with each other and why his character is quite important for this film.

While we have seen similar quirky couples arise from tragic circumstances such as the 1993 film ""Benny & Joon"" which the storyline worked very well, the problem that many critics had with ""Restless"" is that it deals less with the drama and that a young woman such as Annabel is very prepared for death and if anything, Enoch is still reeling from his parent's death.  The focus on their relationship is no discussion of her cancer or death but the two experiencing quality time together.

In someway, I can identify with this film because my mindset was similar to both Enoch and Annabel in the fact that I have approached the death of family members the first time, grieving and not understanding (like Enoch) and the second time around, with acceptance (like Annabel) that they were religious and they go on to a better place and that one has had a quality life, no matter how short or long of life they had.  It's definitely a religious look at life and one's interpretation of death and when it comes to this film, I'm sure people with different religious upbringings or no upbringing will come away from this film with a different opinion.

Sure, the film could have become more emotionally dramatic and had Annabel realizing that she wants' to live and not die but wouldn't that be too banal?  Done many times before in cinema?  If anything, similar to like the quirkiness of ""Benny  & Joon"", I enjoyed the quirkiness of Enoch and Annabel.  Two souls brought together by fate and in essence, helping each other even though their relationship was for a short time.  Quality vs. quantity, acceptance and understanding... it's how I viewed ""Restless"" overall.

And I look forward to seeing more of Dennis Hopper's son Henry grow as an actor and as for Mia Wasikowska, there is no doubt in my mind that this actress is going to have an even more impressive career in the next few years.  Her performance in this film was fantastic!

As for the Blu-ray release of ""Restless"", as a huge silent film fan, it was wonderful to see Gus Van Sant make a second version of this film but via a silent film with intertitles and music.  It was a surprise to see this included as a special feature and for the most part, along with the other special features of this film, it made me enjoy this Blu-ray release even more!

""Restless"" may not be as deep when it comes to drama compared to previous Gus Van Sant films but I've always looked at Van Sant as a filmmaker who tries to find a medium between mainstream cinema and arthouse films.  He may have won two Academy Awards for ""Good Will Hunting"" and most recently for ""Milk"" but it's when he does something unexpected, we can often spot his creative brilliance.

Some may wonder if the fillmmaker is to occupied with films that are about death, may it be ""Gerry"", ""Elephant"" or ""Last Days"" but what I enjoyed about ""Restless"" is the fact that it's a film that is not to heavy, not too dark, not violent but mostly a film that shows us the fine balance between life and mortality... understanding and acceptance.

I know others who have found ""Restless"" emotionally simplistic, too upbeat of a film about mortality and while I do feel i is not the best Van Sant film, I still found ""Restless"" to be beautiful and entertaining.",1336176000,3,8064,4.676595744680851

8491321,4,B0062NAWH0,"Glad to be alive it sings a beautiful song, could be a summary of the characters in this film. This is by the female adolescent Mia Wasikowska in love with the natural world who is describing a songbird which thinks it dies each day when the sun goes down. She goes to funerals for cancer patients and meets young Henry Hopper who crashes strangers funerals; both gawky teenagers secretly in love with mortality, he because his 2 parents dies in a car crash he survived, and she, because she has a brain tumour and her time is limited. Annabel (Wasikoska) appears to play off a Jean Seberg-from -Breathless vibe with her cropped hair. Enoch(Henry Hopper) is haunted by the spirit of a WWII kamikaze fighter pilot, whether a ghost or a figment of his imagination, with whom he plays Battleships. Hiroshi is an aspect of Enoch, reflecting his internal struggle. Hiroshi is like a spirit guide over and near the abyss which Enoch and also Annabel find themselves in. Annabel will help Enoch move on from his parentss deaths, Enoch will help Annabel experience the playful impulsiveness of young love before her death. Hiroshi, by admitting his own fear of death, helps take Annabel onto the afterlife.

The sets are calm,focussed,specific,subdued,autumnal and resonant with a Portland environment, which allows the actors to breathe, outside of the Hollywood machine. Van Sant is the patron saint of outsiders, his visual,emotional style being best brought to bear on teen subjects. These two beautiful outsiders dress up in an array of costumes ,raiding the stock of young adult fictions and dying-too-young scenarios. The loving couple live in a fantastical world of their own, a heightened reality. This is about two people being totally present with each other in a loving relationship. The filmscore and cinematography is delicate and soft. Wasikoskas performance is incredible and give the emotional core to the film. Enoch Brae recalls Harold from Harold and Maude. There are plenty of echoes of other films like the bullies who chase Enoch out of the Halloween party in Lord of the Flies regalia, with pigs head on a stick. This is a quirky,funny,moving film with enough individuality to keep it falling into kitsch melodrama. Lovely music ( The Beatles, Suftan Stephens and Nico).",1441411200,,2286,5.015789473684211
