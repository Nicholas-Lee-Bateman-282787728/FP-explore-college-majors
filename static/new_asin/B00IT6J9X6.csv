6292545,5,B00IT6J9X6,"Need some help creating a home practice?  Don't know how to begin? Looking for ways to open yourself up for advanced poses? Want to be inspired to create flows to teach in your own yoga classes? Then this is the DVD for you!  Seriously - I purchased this DVD in December 2013 through [...] & have already noticed a change in the way I practice by using this instructional DVD.  The instructor, Daphne Larkin, moves effortlessly through the poses & has designed beautiful sequences intended to ground and create subtle openings.  I highly recommend this yoga DVD.  Good for all levels.  I initially purchased the DVD with the intention that I would practice more at home because of a super busy schedule.  What I have noticed is this: by using this DVD for just 20 minutes a day, I feel more energized for the rest of the day!",1394496000,19,825,4.533783783783784
6292546,5,B00IT6J9X6,"This DVD menu looks like that:

- welcome
- flows ( you can pick just one and practice)
- preset practices
- create your practice

Under section ""flows"" you will find:
1) seated meditation ( 5:14)
2) roots of flow ( 13:54)
3) hip opening flow ( 18:53)
4) twists ( 22:54)
5) arm balance flow ( 19:31)
6) supine meditation ( 5:29)
7) earth flow ( 19:54)
8) hip opening flow 2 ( 17:21)
9) backbend flow ( 10:13)
10) supine flow ( 10:13)
11) savasana ( 10:07)

Under section ""Preset practices"" you'll find 5 practices of different length: 81 min, 65 min, 75 min, 84 min, 69 min.

I must admit I prefer a little bit shorter practices and I use mostly the last option from the menu, which is "" Create your own practice"".

I own about 100 different yoga DVDs, and untill now I thought Shiva Rea and Micheline Berry were the best teachers available. Well, this DVD made me change my mind. I don't really know what makes this DVD so special, but after yoga practice with this DVD I feel like I am born again - stress dissolves completely, energy is back, my breath slows, and I feel calmness and bliss. Maybe it's Daphne's calming voice, maybe her timing when she cues the asanas, maybe the fact that this practice is challenging, yet doable and that she holds the pose just the right lenght before moving to the next one. There's something spiritual about this practice in a very subtle way.. The music is great too.
If you are intermidiate yoga practitioner who gets frustrated with Shiva Rea but get bored with other yoga DVDs that lack ""flow"",  and you need a practice that makes you calm and in peace with yourself and the world around you, this is the right choice:)",1442361600,30,1663,4.383116883116883

6292551,4,B00IT6J9X6,"It's a good yoga workout .  But, I am more used to getting into a position and staying (breathing) and then relaxing.  This type of yoga is a more constant flow.",1429056000,,161,4.161290322580645
6292552,5,B00IT6J9X6,"Thank you!  After day six of snow, ice and rain I have been able to keep my sanity by practicing with you.  The DVD has such wonderful sequences of flow which leads one to total relaxation.  Anyone that wants a practice at home will love the knowledge that is shared.",1424476800,,267,4.3
6292553,5,B00IT6J9X6,"This is a great yoga workout DVD! I will say that it isn't for beginners. I have been doing yoga, at home, for a while and had a hard time getting into some of the poses and keeping up. There are several different flow workouts to choose from. You can do them all separately or there are sets already put together. Either way you do it, it's a great workout. This is one of the best yoga DVDs that I've seen! And Daphne is so graceful! I have never seen a yoga instructor that graceful. Watching her is like watching a yoga dance.",1422230400,3,530,4.155339805825243
6292554,5,B00IT6J9X6,"This is my favorite yoga dvd. It is challenging enough to keep me coming back to it, but also makes me feel far more calm and relaxed. It is a great practice to either start or end your day with, or both! She has a calm voice and the flow is so smooth, I have a hard time doing other dvds because they are not as good as this one!

I really hope she makes another one!",1420243200,6,368,3.779220779220779

6292556,5,B00IT6J9X6,"This DVD has been a life saver for me. I have challenges with stress and getting overwhelmed with all that is on my plate....and I don't even have kids yet!!!! I always thought I didn't have enough time to do yoga even though I knew I really needed it. Last week I started getting up an extra 15 minutes early and going yoga. I allow 30 minutes of my morning to be just Daph and me. Her voice is so calming and comforting and all the moves are doable! I feel confident, calm, and at peace when I am finished. Starting my days off in a positive mindset has been the best medication yet.
THANK YOU, DAPHNE!",1415664000,14,604,4.170940170940171
6292557,5,B00IT6J9X6,"Simple and calm. No fluff. I've never tried a program that ""keeps moving"" --poses aren't held for any length of time. At first I was startled and couldn't keep up, but in just three days, I'm improving. I'm very pleased with this dvd.",1409788800,11,234,4.465116279069767
6292558,5,B00IT6J9X6,I loved Daphne's Vinyasa video.  She has an incredible practice and a beautiful way of leading you through the class.  I learned a lot about the postures and know that I will return to it again and again.,1401408000,2,204,4.342105263157895
6292559,5,B00IT6J9X6,"Daphne Larkin's practice is gorgeous.  It's a mesmerizing flow that builds gradually in intensity--you feel like a goddess but you work up a good sweat!  The four practices plus the customizable tracks mean that you can do a Daphne ""class"" or make shorter (or longer) practices.  I hope she makes another one soon--maybe with some inversion practice and more instruction for intermediate variations, and a couple different leadups into shavasana.",1399507200,,446,5.3428571428571425
6292560,5,B00IT6J9X6,I absolutely love this DVD! This is great for folks who want to practice yoga but don't have the time to get to the studio. The poses flow beautifully and I enjoy the music as well!,1396483200,5,181,4.055555555555555
6292561,5,B00IT6J9X6,"GREAT VIDEO! GREAT PRACTICE and PRECISE CLEAR instructions!!! I started to take yoga seriously only about three yeas, after the recommendation of my first yoga teacher, I tried Larkin's yoga and many other teachers at Sanctuary Studio. I must say it is one of the BEST studios that has rich and diverse experienced instructors in town.

This DVD provides all major sections of yoga, you can mix and match to fit you schedule and life style, but do remember practice daily no matter how much time you have. Before you know it you will be developing your own practice that customized to your unique well-being.

If you're in town, please drop by Daphne's live class, you'll be amazed how wonderful her DVD truely is. Get it now!",1396310400,3,726,4.708661417322834
6292562,5,B00IT6J9X6,"This is perfect for working parents because some of the segments are only 17-20 mins long. You can tailor your session for what you feel you need to work on, such as twists. Even when I cannot make it to Daphne's class, her clear instructional style comes through on the DVD so I feel like I am in the room with her and her wonderful spirit.",1396224000,5,341,4.181818181818182
6292563,5,B00IT6J9X6,I have been actively practicing yoga for over 10 years. I also travel a lot for work and am busy working and raising a kid. This DVD is a must have! I take it on the road with me when I'm traveling or pop it in at home when I don't have time to get to a class. Daphne is an amazing teacher and her flow is suitable for a beginner or advanced person hoping to deepen their practice. I seriously can't say enough about this amazing teacher and this DVD she's put out.,1396224000,11,465,3.9574468085106385

6292565,5,B00IT6J9X6,"I love this video! The instruction is very clear without being overwhelming, the music is a great compliment to the instruction, and I love that I can pick and choose different practices depending on what I need that day. I have been practicing yoga for awhile, but I believe the video has so many options that it is designed for beginners or advanced yogis, or those who just need a mediation practice. I highly recommend it! -Gretchen Johnson",1395964800,4,444,4.705128205128205
8645252,1,B00IT6J9X6,Did not like this at all. My fault for thinking I can do yoga at home vs in a studio.,1522627200,,85,3.3
8645253,5,B00IT6J9X6,"Ive been doing yoga off and on for 20 years now. I wanted to introduce it back into my workout routine and based on the reviews thought this would be a good fit. Im so glad I did! This dvd has so many options. I enjoy the preset practices which range in length from 60-70 minutes, and the option to just do individual flows which range from 13 to roughly 20 minutes in length. My favorite option is the ability to design your own practice. I wish more DVDs had this option. As for Daphnes teaching, she is clear, well-paced, challenging. Even if I fall slightly behind, I can catch up easily.
I had also purchased the dvd of the popular PBS yoga show Namaste Yoga, and though I enjoyed it, the preset practices, which had no options other than to just do the presets, were too short for me.
I highly recommend this dvd.",1519776000,,819,4.290322580645161
8645254,5,B00IT6J9X6,Oh yes! I LOVE this dvd. It has so many different routines and poses to learn. It also has meditation. I have been doing Yoga by dvd's for a long time but I needed something new and this is a gem.,1497657600,,196,3.8048780487804876

8645260,1,B00IT6J9X6,"I was very unimpressed with this DVD... when I initially got the DVD the content inside was a poorly made ju jitsu workout. Amazon corrected the order for me but remained unimpresse. I expected it to be a workout that I could learn from; I understood it was a flow yoga but it was incredibly fast, minimal explanation and very low quality production (especially for the price). This might be just the type of workout that some people are looking for but for me this doesn't hold a candle to other yoga DVDs I have.",1443052800,7,514,4.421052631578948
