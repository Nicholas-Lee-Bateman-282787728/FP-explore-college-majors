For one I had to rewind a few times as his accent is strong, I am from Australia (and yes we have a VERY stong accent and we are VERY close to the Brits - but I watched it twice and did not get his humour and did not laugh once and yes maybe it is his accent. If you are british - maybe go for it! but otherwise forget it!  Not for me.",1342742400,,473,3.5384615384615383
8171640,5,B00006RHVG,This DVD is so funny (more so if you Americans can understand what he is saying). Pure unadulterated fun.,1206921600,2,105,4.578947368421052
