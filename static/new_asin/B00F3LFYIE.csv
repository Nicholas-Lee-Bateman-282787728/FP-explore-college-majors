8611954,5,B00F3LFYIE,"Lightning & Cragg is all that is good about short film making. Nothing wrong with block-busters, but to truly understand the art of film making, you need to view it in from the angle of where every major director and actor began. The low budget highly creative independent world of films. Bravo Michael Scott and crew. You have done it again!",1379289600,,342,4.622950819672131
