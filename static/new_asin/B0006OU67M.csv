2190643,5,B0006OU67M,"Anybody who knows anything about Bigfoot knows that this documentary stands head and shoulders above the rest because it landed unprecedented access to Jeff Meldrum, the Idaho professor.

It was cool to see inside his lab and watch the filmmakers try to stump him with a fake cast.

And the eyewitness reports were cool too. The made a believer out of me.

Very compelling",1109635200,8,372,4.78125
2190644,5,B0006OU67M,"It's nice to see a Bigfoot show that doesn't rehash the same old territory. This has a lot of info that has not been seen in a documentary before. And nobody has more from Prof. Jeff Meldrum, the top serious scientist of this phenomenon. And I like the ""Gen-X"" feel of this film. Some confused reviewers might see this as amtateurish (probably the same people who think the shakey camera on ""Law and Order"" is a mistake); I liked the fast-action and fun pace.",1109635200,6,459,4.476190476190476
2190645,1,B0006OU67M,"The few who awarded this DVD 5 stars must be the same people who force their friends and family to watch home movies of their kid's b-day parties.

Simply put: This DVD sucks!

Although the first half did have two interesting eyewitness accounts, the techniques used to present the material were horrible.  I concur with others here who mentioned how this DVD was boring, presented nothing new and that awful ""expedition"" into the mountains with a group of unprofessional college kids who actually mistook the sounds of flying geese for a ""family of monkeys running over the hills.""

Oh yeah, and let's not forget the geniuses who emptied a canister of Quaker Oatmeal on a snow-covered log in hopes of baiting a Bigfoot.  One of the campers heard from a friend that once upon a time a backpacker's backpack had been ransacked by a Bigfoot and the the oatmeal packets were consumed.  Sure.

I work for a video production company that produces mediocre quality training videos for professional development and I still think this 60-minute DVD was worse.

One last thing.  I can't tell you how irritating it was to watch the static-3/4-sky-video-with-audio-overlay!  This technique was used throughout the DVD.  If I didn't know what the title was and had the sound muted, I would have guessed this was a how-to video on dove hunting.  Note to producers: When I watch a Bigfoot video and there is a recounting of a sighting where you are trying to paint a picture of what happened, pan the mountains, streams, valleys, meadows, etc. where the event took place.  The first time this technique was used in the DVD was my clue that the producers had nothing to show.  This is where I should have stopped watching.

Save your $15.",1109376000,6,1723,4.773648648648648
2190646,1,B0006OU67M,"Ok Bigfoot fans, I know what you're thinking: ""Hey, this is great! A brand new documentary about our pal Sasquatch...and on DVD no less!"" Unfortunately, that's where your elation peaks. Just because this is among the few Bigfoot documentaries on DVD (""Sasquatch: Legend meets Science"" and ""Sasquatch Odyssey"" are the other most popular), does not mean you should purchase it (especially if you are just getting into this subject matter). For anyone interested in a good introduction to the Bigfoot phenomena, please purchase ""Ancient Mysteries: Bigfoot"" hosted by Leonard Nimoy. It's over 10 years old, but still the best I've seen on the subject. If you must have a DVD (because let's face it, who still remembers what a VCR is?) then buy ""Sasquatch: Legend meets Science"" as it has really good bonus materials (including the entire Patterson film).

Now, if you're a veteran Bigfoot enthusiast and have seen the documentaries already out there, read on about the DVD in question (because you're the only ones who will relate to my references)!

In the first half of the documentary, we see Dr. Jeff Meldrum (Idaho State University), doing his best to fill the shoes of Dr. Grover Krantz (veteran Bigfoot scholar who recently passed away), except Krantz was much cooler. Meldrum brings nothing new to the table in ""Rocky Mountain Bigfoot"" (unless you consider it remarkable that he can decipher a real footprint from one cast with a pumpkin skin). Nevertheless, Meldrum goes through the motions in his role as a scholarly reference, rehashing all the standard arguments for the creature's existence (at least he's not still going on about that Skookum cast).

Salvaging the first 30 minutes of the DVD are two eyewitness accounts, which were rather interesting, but not extraordinary. Other than that, the first half of the DVD was pretty much old hat.

The latter 30 minutes of ""Rocky Mountain Bigfoot"" was a complete waste of time (moreover, I may actually be dumber for watching it). To sum it up: It's like I went camping with my friends and left the video recorder on while we slept...and nothing interesting happened.

Bottom line: Don't buy this DVD. I did, and the only reason I don't regret it is because I got to write this review for everyone else!",1109116800,4,2260,4.936842105263158
2190647,2,B0006OU67M,"I can't in all honesty recommend this movie except for those us who are die-hard Bigfoot fans that cannot get enough of the stuff. It looks and feels like a college art project or a home video put together about some friends who got together after watching a few Bigfoot documentaries and decided to make their own. There is nothing new; no new footage, still images, tracks, casts, etc. - but the production techniques were pretty good. Have to give all the crew an A for effort.",1108771200,5,480,4.528735632183908
2190648,2,B0006OU67M,"This Video had potential! The 1st half half of the video shows good

evidence plus eye witness accounts. The 2nd half of the video is very amaturish (kind of blair witch style). In the 2nd half they

take you on an expedition with a bunch of college age goofballs

who know nothing about bigfoot research! This part of the film sucks! Nothing happens on their outing! Based on the last half of the film, I would reccomend buying it. Take care!",1107216000,4,443,4.444444444444445
2190649,5,B0006OU67M,"This insightful documentary is one that challenges the mind to think outside of the box.  Is there a possibilty that an ape-like creature roams the Rocky Mountains?  Yes there is and the evidence to support this claim is growing.  The film offers evidence such as eyewitness accounts and expert analysis.  Moreover, it is entertaining and ends with an interesting and frightening expedition gone right.",1106611200,5,402,5.234375
2190650,5,B0006OU67M,It's great to see something new on this topic. Too many of these shows just rehash the famous Paterson film. This DVD does a nice job of presenting the new scientific evidence - and the sightings documented are pretty persuasive.,1101945600,4,229,4.75

8042160,3,B0006OU67M,"This DVD was produced in 2004 in the state of Idaho by a 5-time Emmy winner and his intrepid crew, and I recommend it if you want to hear some good eyewitness accounts from the state of Idaho, and also hear from Dr. Jeff Meldrum. One of the more interesting parts of this documentary is when a group of students decides to try to fool Dr. Meldrum with a fake track made out of all things, a piece of a pumpkin shaped like a foot with dermal ridges painted on. It's a neat trick, since a pumpkin does resemble a human foot in texture, but Dr. Meldrum isn't so easily fooled. Two compelling eyewitness accounts round up the first half-hour, with both interviewees believing that they had sightings because they were engaged in activity that attracted the attention of the Sasquatch. Dr. Meldrum is also seen in the field investigating with a group of researchers. The first half-hour I have no problem with; the second half-hour leaves a bit to be desired. A crew of young students goes out in the woods in what can only be described as a cross between The Blair Witch Project and The Real World. The five students don't seem to have the most basic clue about how to react when a Bigfoot is nearby (they freak out when they hear a pack of geese fly over, for cripes' sake!). They mistake the geese for a bunch of monkeys chattering, which indicates they are true greenhorns who don't know the most basic things about the forest sounds. They do lay out bait consisting of oatmeal, which seems pretty sound strategy to be honest, since Dr. Meldrum did mention that in the course of his field research, he heard backpacks being rifled through by some animal, possibly a Sasquatch, but he did not see it for sure. However, the main things that were taken were oatmeal packets by whatever animal ransacked the backpacks. I won't give away too much more, but this documentary isn't too bad, and I do recommend it, even with a few reservations. It is available through Amazon.com",1148860800,7,1970,4.552112676056338
8042161,1,B0006OU67M,I got this for christmas 05 and what a big disappointment it was.  It you follow bigfoot at all do not get this. if new to bigfoot or must have everything bigfoot for collection than go for it,1141344000,4,192,4.052631578947368
8042162,3,B0006OU67M,"I thought the book was OK....I was looking for some encounters to read about and possibly some behavioural information. After reading the book it fell short of that...this book is mainly about the hike as opposed to any encounters, although he does have one for sure. Some good info from the local agencies as well....I must say though, the author seems to portray himself as a very conciencious traveller of the woods and I respect him for that.

All in all a good book if you want to go out and see some nice scenery....and maybe a Sasquatch if your lucky......",1141084800,3,563,4.574257425742574
8042163,1,B0006OU67M,"Thank god this was given to me as a gift. Had I actually spent money on this amateurish train wreck, I would be REALLY pissed. I can think of absolutely no redeeming qualities to this DVD, and will never get the time back I spent watching this piece of feces.",1136764800,5,259,4.2
8042164,1,B0006OU67M,"Terrible, amateur-ish filmmaking (not to mention DVD authoring my 13-year-cousin could achieve on his PC in his bedroom).

Half this so-called documentary is spent ""investigating"" one eyewitness' sighting. The video crew (apparently students from Idaho State U) decide they're equipped to make a scientific, biological investigation and it comes off like a cheap version of The Real World. Laughable. Don't waste your time or your money.",1126224000,16,437,5.621212121212121
8042165,1,B0006OU67M,"Too bad it's Carrie Hitchcock.

Makes an attempt at being a serious documentary for 24 minutes, then it turns into an episode of MTV's Real World goes camping in Idaho to look for Bigfoot.

The minutae of camping in a State Forrest(20 feet from a concrete bench) are yours to enjoy for the next 30 minutes until we are finally allowed to resume our lives.

On the plus side, you get classic lines like ""While Russ initiates the process of building a fire"" and ""I can't feel my feet"".  And my personal favorite(who thought you'd ever hear this in a Bigfoot documentary?) ""I couldn't find my pants"".

Almost MST3K worthy.

8042166,1,B0006OU67M,"This DVD was a total waste of time and money.  I would really like to see something more definitive on the subject, and more recent.  I NEVER thought that I would ever pay to watch a DVD of someones camping trip.  I am very well read on this subject, and am always looking for something new and exciting on this subject.  Is Sasquatch real?  I believe that he is!  The evidence, though anecdotal, is compelling.  I only gave this DVD one star because I couldn't give it none.",1117065600,6,475,4.329545454545454
8042167,5,B0006OU67M,"The thing I liked about this DVD is that is really gets outside Washington and Oregon. The filmmakers focused on the area around Idaho and Utah--not your stereotypical bigfoot area. But anyone who has lived in the Intermountain region knows there have been plenty of sasquatch sightings in that area.

Anbd while most films on this topic focus on the same old 3 or 4 sightings, this piece uncovers two encounters that are not as widely known--but very intriguing nonetheless.

The first half of the film lays out the case for bigfoot in general and then tracks down two of these encounters with the actual eyewitnesses. In both cases, the eyewitnesses return to the scene of the sightings for the first time since they saw the creature. It's pretty interesting.

Then the filmmakers spend the night at the remote location where one of the sightings took place.

I rather enjoyed it. It's true to it's title ""Rocky Mountain Bigfoot.""",1109808000,7,932,4.8427672955974845
