2406324,1,B000B7QCRM,"I'm surprised there's no option for 0 stars, because this movie would earn that honor.

We saw this movie advertised in Maxim Magazine this month, so we figured, what the heck, it's worth a shot.

30 minutes into the movie we wanted to shoot ourselves.  The acting is horrid. The dialogue is even worse.  The actress who was supposed to be playing the ""hot chick on campus"" was nothing to be desired for.  I don't understand the DVD cover; it really has nothing to do with the movie.  I would have figured this cover art would have fit the movie ""Bring It On"" more.

So anyway; there are very things to laugh at in this movie. If there was; they over-did it to the point where it just wasn't that funny.

If you want to torture yourself, I urge you to save the $$ and wait for this movie to hit cable/primetime/etc.  At least then you can laugh at the commercials that interrupt this poor excuse of a movie.

Broken Lizard indeed.",1134950400,2,930,4.354651162790698
2406325,5,B000B7QCRM,"If you attended prep school or a tiny college in the middle of nowhere, you will love puddle cruiser.  They got every single detail correct, and it was shot on location at Colgate University, the filmmakers' alma mater.  It's a small film, made for nothing by the very funny Broken Lizard guys.  It tells a classic story of boy meets girl, boy steals girl from her boyfriend, boyfriend gets revenge, girl freaks out because the guys are fighting.  Many great gags and quotable lines.  Very good stuff.",1134950400,6,501,4.712643678160919
2406326,1,B000B7QCRM,"That's essentially what this film is. It's a wreck. Perhaps there are a few parts that will remind you of Super Troopers, but largely it's dreck.

Broken Lizard is pretty much a one-hit wonder. Club Dread may actually be worse than Puddle Cruiser.",1134864000,,247,4.744186046511628
2406327,3,B000B7QCRM,"I've liked the past Broken Lizard movies, but Puddle Cruiser is lacking the humor. It's not anywhere close to Super Troopers. The filming is poor quality. The movie is an attempt to cashin in on Super Troopers and Club Dead.",1134259200,,224,4.625
2406328,4,B000B7QCRM,"I thought this movie was great. Even though the comedy was nothing like Super Troopers, and thank god it was nothing like Club Dread, I found it enjoyable. If I had to compare it to another movie I'd say it was a lot like Clerks. The acting at times in terrible, but most of the jokes come off well and are really funny. The movie basically revolves around this guy who gets into relationship with a girl who is still dating her old boyfriend.  The main character is Dante'esque in the fact that he has no spine, and is a bit of a loser. The plot is pretty strong, and believable and has a nice climatic ending. If you're not going to buy it, I highly suggest you rent it because it has one of the greatest lines ever in a movie (when one friend basically ruins anothers chances of hooking up with a girl at a bar).",1134259200,2,815,4.158227848101266
2406329,5,B000B7QCRM,"Puddle Cruiser is much funnier when considered as an early effort by Broken Lizard.  I guarantee it will be a cult hit.  It was shown at my college in the mid 90's, and everyone loved it.",1133827200,,187,4.166666666666667
2406330,1,B000B7QCRM,"...is pretty awful.

Broken Lizard fans will probably balk at a negative review but... take my one-star with a grain of salt, rent it and see for yourself.  If you enjoy ""Puddle,"" more power to you, bud.

I found the jokes infrequent and flat, the pacing is leaden and the plot of this fledgling, early 90s effort is almost non-existent: A semi-likable college doofus tries to steal a brainy co-ed away from her knuckleheaded boyfriend.  The doofus is no great shakes but the boyfriend is such a goober it's impossible to believe she'd be with him so... where can you go from there?

Every now and then, a funny idea or a successful gag floats by, but they're few and far between.  Sometimes the scenes go on way too long, sometimes they just end.

I've liked the Lizard guys since ""Super Troopers"" and have waited a long time to see this.  They're the only good thing in the movie; even back then they were confident and had good chemistry together, though here the lines they're spouting are usually pretty weak and dated.

The movie's good natured enough, and director Chandrasekar (who'd go on to do episodes of ""Freaks & Geeks"" and, alas, ""The Dukes of Hazzard"") is able to at least give the film a semi-professional look, but they really should've worked on the script longer.

Still, everybody has to start somewhere.",1133827200,10,1324,4.668103448275862
2406331,4,B000B7QCRM,"I broke down and rented this movie online through cinema now a couple of years ago after seeing super troopers.  Although not as laugh out loud funny as Super Troopers, it is a different kind of funny.  I have been trying to find this movie everywhere and have been eagerly awaiting its release.  I am looking forward to December!!!!",1128729600,9,333,4.610169491525424

2406352,2,B000B7QCRM,"As much as this movie was talked up by the gang in other films, I have to say that it just isn't very well put together.  I can see why it didn't find distribution until after the vastly better Super Troopers.  This is by far their worst film, and should only be considered for completionists or film students who are analyzing the projection of the film makers.",1388966400,,362,4.388059701492537

I love Beerfest, Club Dread, and Super Troopers.
Slammin' Salmon was just ok. Not a movie i can loop like the 3 above and remember every line.

This was their first movie, and they didn't have any real money to do much.
It's worth 2 to 5 bucks, but nothing more.
I can't blame them because they didn't have much to spend.

I got the collection now. The one thing I took away from the movie was how they had a bus and drove around on campus and promoted the movie, and gave the students a free showing.",1388361600,,536,4.037735849056604

Super Troopers was a major jump forward. This movie attempted to have some serious aspects, which I feel hurt Broken Lizard's typical comedic productions.",1353801600,,318,4.5964912280701755
2406357,2,B000B7QCRM,Hate to say it but so far the worst Broken Lizard Group movie I have seen to date. Like most of their other stuff so I thought I would give this one a try. Was dissapointed. Didn't really find the movie amusing.,1312502400,,211,4.0476190476190474

2406359,4,B000B7QCRM,"If you aren't a Broken Lizard fan, no doubt this film wouldn't hit your radar.  After becoming a huge fan of BEERFEST, i had to see some of Broken Lizard's earlier work.  This one stacks up nicely to other low budget films (i think the entire movie was done for less than $50k?).  Steve is the main character, a typical college student trying to make it with the Student Body President.  Unfortunately, she's got a boyfriend from high school who plays rugby.  The rest of the BL crew fill in as his buddies.  Erik's character is quite eccentric (sic).  The humor is not as laugh out loud funny, but an enjoyable movie nonetheless.  Also check out The Slammin' Salmon, Broken Lizards newest flick which ranks up with Beerfest and Super Troopers.",1273795200,,744,4.625954198473282

2406372,2,B000B7QCRM,"First of all I purchased this movie from my local CD Warehouse because it was on sale (2 for $3.99). I expected better than what I watched from the film. I wasn't able to follow the plot of the movie because they goes off about each of the five Lizards. I did think the movie was funny and I laughed through various scenes such as the one in the cafeteria where the lizards get caught, which is why I am giving the movie two stars instead of one. If you are into crude humor I slightly recommend this movie, but it definitely isn't worth spending the money buy.

The only part I liked was the chemistry between the 5 Lizards, but not much else.",1228003200,,644,4.193548387096774
2406373,3,B000B7QCRM,"I purchased this movie because Zack Chapman used to be my neightbor in Summit, New Jersey and he plays the Australian rugby player in the film.

Also a bunch of coworkers and friends are big fans of the Broken Lizard movies, so I guess to catch up to speed, I would start from the beginning and get thier first movie.

It was funny, but I did not find myself laughing out loud all that much. I think the pace was a little too slow, and there was too much conversation without enough comedy (after seeing Super Troopers, I think that they solved this problem - which was most likely due to the fact that they were new filmmakers).

The funniest part is the ""Garbage Dick"" scene - hands down.",1214438400,,690,4.333333333333333
2406374,3,B000B7QCRM,"Every comedy group that gets into movies has to have their first one, and as much as I enjoy Broken Lizard's films, this isn't exactly MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL (AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT wasn't exactly a film, right?). It is, however, a pretty decent entry in the college movie genre, as it attempts to have realistic characters (along with the broad, off-the-wall characters the Lizards most often play) in semi-realistic situations (think of it as the SEINFELD of college movies, not in terms of quality but subject matter). Steve Lemme is designated the lead this time and the part of the straight man as Felix Bean, who falls for Suzanne McKenna (Kayren Butler), who might be student council president (we just don't know). Unfortunately, Suzanne is already dating burly, Crazy Joe Davola lookalike Traci Shannon (Jamison Selby), who a la the Boy Named Sue is a volcano waiting to erupt. Felix gets advice from his wiseass friend Zach (director Jay Chandrasekhar) and hippie mailroom guy Freaky Reaky (Erik Stolhanske), who are also having lady problems, Zach with a hot girl who constantly is running the track and who gave Zach 6 of the digits to her phone number and Freaky with Suzanne and Felix's mutual friend Emily (Alison Clapp). The remaining Lizards, Kevin Heffernan & Paul Soter, play troublemaking duo Grogan and Matt, respectively, who along with Felix tried to raid the cafeteria and got caught (Felix made a successful escape), and now pre-law student Suzanne is their lawyer (leading to a very funny courtroom scene where Matt & Grogan must represent themselves and rely on courtroom scenes in movies and the like). Felix and Suzanne have issues, dating drama, blah blah blah. The romantic subplot is convincing enough, as what Lemme and Butler lack in acting ability they make up for with characters we can relate to. The other four Lizards are playing the kinds of characters they will play in their later films (especially Heffernan, Chandrasekhar, and Soter; after this Stolhanske usually played the straight man... well, if you've seen CLUB DREAD that's not entirely true) and showcase the kind of humor that would be evident in those films. PUDDLE CRUISER is funny, sometimes sweet, and makes up for its 'first film inadequacies' with chemistry between the five Lizards that led them down the path of comedy gold (well, at least silver).",1202860800,,2387,5.0
2406375,5,B000B7QCRM,You can tell it is early Broken Lizard and it has more of a serious plot than most of their films but still remains funny.  It was worth purchasing might be a better rental if you can find it.,1191974400,,192,3.923076923076923
2406376,3,B000B7QCRM,"Ok everyone, if you're looking for a really well-acted comedy... well, keep looking. I have to say though, I liked this movie anyway just because of the novelty of it being the gang from Super Troopers and Beerfest. They have definitely improved since this movie though. I like having it in my collection, though. And even though I knew in the first few minutes of the movie that it wasn't going to be the best one I'd ever seen, I still couldn't stop watching it. And I'll admit the storyline was kind of cute. So just don't go into it with TOOOOO many expectations. :) But enjoy it as their first movie. :)",1186617600,,608,4.389380530973451
2406377,3,B000B7QCRM,"This film is perfect for a feature Amazon.com should have: half-stars. 2.5 stars would be the ideal rating for this movie, as it's fairly average.

There are definitely the flashes of Broken Lizard genius in this film; certain moments are priceless. Overall, though, it's clearly an early film, as the pacing is off, the resolution leaves a little something to be desired, and several sub-plots are left dangling.

Still, it's easy to see why BL got the chance to make Super Troopers after this film, and why so many like the film. It definitely has its moments, and even if you don't like it, it's tough to really regret having watched it if you're a Broken Lizard fan. While it's not their best film, it's far from horrible, and definitely worth watching. Whether you buy it or not depends on your level of fandom, I suppose - but it's a good comedy to have on the shelf, to be sure.",1170028800,,885,4.525
2406378,1,B000B7QCRM,"This movie is a limp-wristed romantic comedy!  As a huge fan of broken lizard, I was looking forward to seeing this early work with fairly low expectations; Not expecting another super troopers but probably a low budget quirkily funny humor.  And yet I was still disappointed.  The amazing thing is there is no indiciation that the guys who made this movie would go onto do the hilarious off-beat comedies that they would subsequently create.

One major problem is that this film stars Steve Lemme, and he is clearly the weakest link among the five club dread guys.  He may be the best-looking, but he's the least funny and probably the worst actor of the troupe.  And his character is fairly unlikeable, a sort of bland and uninteresting twit, the typical lead in girlish date movies (which is what this is), made all the worse by Lemme's ""serious"" acting.  In their other movies, the broken lizard guys did well to limit Lemme's weaknesses.  In this movie, they highlight them.

Another problem is that the Freaky Reaky character, played by Eric Stolhnanske, is kind of lame and gets actively annoying at times.  This is probably the worst character the Broken Lizard guys have come up with yet.  It's this stock hippie stoner character who's supposed to be over the top, but actually just seriously grates.

A third problem is that they spend too much of this movie not telling jokes, but making an annoying, tepid, typical and uninspired romantic comedy.  Chandrasekhar, Heffernan, and Soter are pretty good in their roles, but their screen time, especially that of the latter two, is way too small.

There are some funny bits, but there's nothing here that is as ridiculously funny as their other movies.  One of the great things about Broken Lizard is that they've developed a fresh, distinctive, and original brand of comedy.  That is not in evidence here.  These jokes are stale and conventional.  The bonus featurette, rodeo clowns, showing their tour of colleges to promote this movie is often more entertaining, but is not enough to recommend this purchase.  Meanwhile the commentaries are frustrating, because these guys still seem to be suffering under the illusions that this is a good movie and that some of their crappy jokes are funny.  It would be more interesting if they talked about things they learned while making this and how they applied those lessons to making their subsequent movies comedic successes.",1166486400,2,2429,4.921375921375922
2406379,4,B000B7QCRM,"You gotta stick with this one!  I'll be the first to admit, the first twenty or so minutes threw me.  I was expecting the usual over-the-top madness of the Broken Lizard boys, but this begins as a well-written, at times low-key campus life comedy.  However, once the characters are developed the gang cuts loose--the courtroom sequence is my favorite scene from all of their films.  And just seeing the (much younger) guys hanging out on frat couches is tons of fun.",1162080000,,466,4.716049382716049

If you're looking for the same comedy as in ""ST"", you will be dissapointed. No weed jokes or police jokes in this movie, however I was laughing out loud for most of it. The plot is thin but consistent. The cast works great together and I love to see independant film-makers gain success.
Some funny moments are when one guy is telling a girl who is interested in his buddy horrible things about him...
So hilarious!

This movie flat-out SUCKED!!

I did not know that this was, in fact, a first/college film going into it.  To its credit, it LOOKS okay, but it is a steaming mess from beginning to end.  The jokes, with a few exceptions, were nowhere to be found and the ones I did like could've been written better.  There was absolutely NO chemistry between any of the Lizards or their supporting cast.
