cast brings the stories such realism that you expect to hear about them on your nightly news!  Pack up the Emmys and hand them ouright!

7295598,5,B00ZWC16CC,This show just keeps getting better and season 5 is packed with drama and action and does not disappoint! After seeing season 5  I can't wait for the sixth season to start! This is the only TV show I faithfully watch! It's perfect for the whole family.,1439251200,3,252,4.361702127659575
7295599,5,B00ZWC16CC,"Blue Bloods is, without a doubt, the best crime drama on television.  I am a devoted fan of NCIS, but I think BlueBloods outranks NCIS as far as great TV goes.  I wish CBS would give this show a better timeslot, it deserves it, however, I think politics has something to do with this.  There's no doubt the Reagan family leans towards the right, and justly so. Anyway, Season 5 is just as gripping as Season1, and I will purchase the complete series someday when it's run is finished, which I hope is at least another 10 years or so.  Just an all around great show!!",1438300800,16,566,4.311320754716981
7295600,5,B00ZWC16CC,"This show is truly great. From the police drama to the family dynamics it will never let you down. I did not begin watching this show until Season 4 had started and picked up Season 1 on DVD.  This show is special. I will finish Season 4 this evening and am only sorry I will have to wait for the Season 5 release. It is not possible  for me to say enough good things about this show. If you have not seen an episode  then pick up Season 1 today. You will not be disappointed.

This show has covered some headline topics without pulling any punches. That is a rarity on broadcast television today. I was pleased to see Blue Bloods renewed for a 6th season. With what is going on in the world today a ten year run would be appropriate. I say again, this show does does not disappoint.",1437091200,16,783,4.1655629139072845
7295601,5,B00ZWC16CC,"Blue Bloods, a police procedural about a family of New York City cops, opens its excellent fifth season with an episode guaranteed to get fans involved right away. Detective Danny Reagan talks his partner Maria Baez into doing an extra shift as escorts for the movement of some drugs confiscated by the DEA. The convoy is ambushed, the drugs stolen, and Baez injured. A repentant Danny is left to deal with a drug cartel. Meanwhile, Danny's younger brother, beat cop Jamie Reagan, faces the end of his partnership with fellow cop Eddie Janko, when their feelings for each other come to the attention of their police sergeant. Sister (and assistant district attorney) Erin will offer Jamie some good advice. Meanwhile, Commissioner (and father) Frank Reagan will face yet another challenge in which his desire to do right by his officers will be tested by city politics. And that's just the season opener.

Blue Bloods Season Five continues its winning formula of family drama wrapped around life in the Big Apple.  One episode will deal with a policewoman who turns her partner in for using an illegal chokehold; another with a cop who comes out as gay, splitting a partnership; still another involves a suspect who is injured while in police custody.  The thrilling two-part season finale deals with a relentless and edgy search for justice for a murdered police official who happens to be an old friend of Commissioner Reagan.  The stories might be ripped from the headlines, but Blue Bloods managed to make them into complex as well as compelling drama.

""Blue Bloods"" has been renewed for a sixth season on CBS television.  Season Five is highly recommended to fans of the series.",1435881600,32,1684,4.911971830985915
7295602,4,B00ZWC16CC,"I don't usually watch tv series, I'm more a movie watcher person. Having said so, I got hooked to this one because I love Tom Selleck performances. I find Commissioner Reagan character especially interesting because it contrasts with the darker Jesse Stone. The rest of the characters has kept my interested from season 1 until now, with one exception only: Erin Reagan. This ADA lady does not look real to me. Actually, it totally bugs me she barely smiles, she is always playing ADA with everyone, everywhere, every time. She is always distrusting the whole world, playing 007. Erin Reagan does not look real to me and it came to the point that it really bugs me. Other than that, it's a good tv show.",1526774400,,703,4.632

7295639,1,B00ZWC16CC,"I DO not know if I am the only one who has had issues with this season playing properly, I have 2 because the first was replaced because a few dvds were flawed and could not be viewed at all. The second was the same. Such a disappointment because I wanted to collect them all. I travel very much and many locations so I did not have the opportunity to send them back and be available to check it out in a timely manner. So stuck with 2 dvds that you can't watch all the way through. Some of the same ones are defected or I could take out the ones that work to complete the set. I am afraid to order the 6 or 7th season now. I love these shows there no other police shows like it. I am not a happy camper. I am wearing out the other seasons just to watch the shows because I DO not desire a 8th I just order what I want to watch. I love blue bloods 1vstar for being defected.

7295701,5,B00ZWC16CC,"Blue Bloods - Season Five  [722 - 2016-08-28]

Summary:
The location is contemporary New York City and the theme is a police procedural from a unique prospective. The shows focus around the Regan family: his oldest son Danny (Danny Wahlberg) a hotshot detective; another son Jamie is Harvard educated but by choice a rookie Frank (Tom Selleck) is the Police Commissioner cop; daughter Erin is an assistant D.A. and Henry - Frank's father, a former NYC Police Commissioner. Another son Joe, a NYC policemen killed in the line of duty, is an off stage presents in some episodes. Rounding out the cast are Danny's wife Linda, single mom Erin's precocious daughter and Danny's two sons. Throughout all five seasons the cast and the actors that portray them has remained intact. This is one of the significant reason for the show's popularity.

I honestly thought season 4 stories was only modestly interesting and the dialog seemed to loose it's customary snap. Would season Five be the death spiral for the series? Pleased to see that my fears were unfounded. Season Five had many exceptional episodes and the ruminations of Commissioner Frank Regan when confronted with a moral conundrum resulted in compelling viewing - all is well with Blue Bloods.

Content:
The Season Five package consists of 6 disks and 22 episodes originally show on CBS during the period September 2014 through May 2015. Also included are several special features on disk 6.

Positive Comments:
 Many fewer deleted scenes in season five, which is unfortunate since they are usually quite interesting.
 Season five incorporated no major changes to the story formula - the is one very successful show - no major shakeups!
 Danny's replacement detective is always a hottie yet there is never a hint of hanky-panky.
 With Danny's wife working in the hospital...well you know all of her husband Danny's suspects and vics are sent to the same hospital...and yes his wife is usually the caregiver. Well, it TV Land folks!
 I greatly admire the Regan family. They ague, rage against one another sometimes, but all are pulling the wagon in the same direction.
 It was refreshing to see a show with an honest focus on genuine family values even with members who are contrary and strongly opinionated.
 I continue to enjoy the New York City local for these episodes. That city has so many neighborhoods both glamorous and shabby and the show is a case study in urban renewal if you ask me.
 It was nice to see the children of Erin and Danny getting some roles instead on being the usual window dressing.

The Cast:
Tom Selleck and Danny Wahlberg are terrific in their roles. Other cast members are very good - and see significant air time to show their acting chops.

Negative Comments:
 Honestly I can't say much negative about this show. It is exceptional for a police procedural.

Recommendations:
This is a highly recommend show that over five seasons has keep my interest. If police procedurals within the context of a strong family appeal to you I believe you will enjoy viewing season 5 of Blue Bloods.",1472515200,,3070,4.873076923076923

7295706,5,B00ZWC16CC,"The best Police drama on TV, EVER~!  I grew up in a neighborhood of cops and fireman (Irish and German) and this is what they'd wish that life would be about: gathering for a Sunday dinner with the family and hopefully leaving 'the job' talk out of it.  My Father and two of my Uncles (COPs), and another Uncle (Fireman & Battalion Chief), as well as a second cousin (COP, Deputy Chief Inspector) were there to tell the tales of public service.  I wasn't always privy to ALL the talk that went around, but enough to know that what they did was dangerous  but necessary.  ""Blue Bloods"" goes beyond what I hoped to see one day.  It is well written, very well cast and overall, simply better.  I understand that the Sunday gathering of the clan was Tom Selleck's idea; and for that I would like to personally thank him.  We didn't have any Harvard grads or attorneys in our family, but otherwise, for me, it was scene out of childhood.  We always said Grace and Thanked the Lord for the food from His bounty  something more folks should be doing these days.  If you ever get to see only one Police drama, make it this one!  Any season will do. They're all terrific.",1470873600,4,1162,4.378504672897196

I just started watching Blue Bloods last May quite by chance. I rarely watch television but when I happen to switch on the television and saw Jaime Reagan in a police uniform I decided not to change the channel. And what kept me watching this television show was how each and every member of the Reagan family interact and create heart-warming memorable episodes.

The Reagan family returns once more to take on the criminals of New York City in their various roles. If you're new to the series the show follows the family of Police Commissioner Frank Reagan (Tom Selleck). Being a member of New Yorks finest is a long held tradition in the family with Franks father Henry (Len Cariou) having served as Commissioner himself. But Franks children have also followed in their forefathers footsteps as well.

Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a highly decorated detective known for being a bit of a hothead at times. Married to Linda (Amy Carlson), he also has two young boys who make a weekly appearance at the Sunday dinner with Frank and Henry. Next in line is Erin (Bridget Moynahan), a divorced mother who works in the district attorneys office as an assistant D.A. Her daughter Nicky (Sami Gayle) also makes her way to the weekly dinner table as well as an occasional storyline of her own. Last in line is the youngest son Jamie (Will Estes), a law school grad who decided to go into the family business rather than the courtroom.

Each week the usual crime drama is presented but in a different mode than most police shows offer. Rather than start with a crime, show the investigation and then the inevitable arrest, the show tackles things from the perspective of this family that are all involved in the business of stopping crime. Each one has an opinion on various cases and they voice those at a round table of sorts when they get together for Sunday dinner. It allows a development of what weve watched happening in each episode giving the issue or crime more depth than most police shows allow.

It also presents us with different aspects of what goes on in the world of police than a simple crime solving show would. From Franks end we witness the difficulty of his position, trying to defend his men while at the same time holding them to higher standards than other would. Not only that, he must contend with the political aspects of his position in dealing with the mayor and various prominent citizens looking for publicity or favors. From Danny we get the frustration he handles daily witnessing some of the worst crimes possible and the problematic but much needed restrictions placed on all officers. With Erin were presented with the limitations she must inflict on officers in an attempt to make a case stick. And with Jamie we witness the beginnings of a young officer, his expectations and experiences while at the same time making sure that his being the Commissioners son presents him with not special treatment.

One thing this series hasn't tried to do is present a cliff hanger from one season to the next. Each season is tidied up into separate episodes with an occasional tie in from one to the next. This makes for a series that you can jump into without knowing the details of past episodes. Thats a good thing for the new viewer although once you begin watching chances are youll want to go back and get caught up.

The series covers a number of topics, many that come straight from the headlines. One example is when Danny is accused of police brutality, a situation where one slip in the investigation by Frank could lead to both of them having problems. Another involves Jamie and the relationship he has with his partner, a female officer named Edit Jenko (Vanessa Ray), should it remain professional or will the attraction they find for one another interfere with work? Danny also has a new boss this season to adjust to while his old boss, Sid Gormley (Robert Clohessy) starts his new job working in Franks office. Mob informants, low income housing victims, stalkers, celebrity chefs and more all take center stage from one week to the next, offering problems to be solved by the family Reagan.

That word family is what really makes this show work too. Any series can be made about police officers and indeed there have been many. What makes this one different is that beyond the daily work that all of them are involved in there is also the fact that they are family that lies beneath it all no matter what happens. This is not a dysfunctional family that hates one another or fights non-stop. This is a family that loves and respects one another. Dont get me wrong, they might disagree with one another or argue at times, but they still have that lasting family bond there that they return to each week. Thats something thats nice to see on television. There are actually several series that have turned to this and all seem to be more successful because of it. While shows that don't adhere to these principle seem to fall by the wayside, its nice to see this one remain on the air and do decent in the ratings.

So if you're a fan of the Reagan family, if you love the police no matter whats being said about them these days or if you just like a good crime drama, than make sure you give this one a watch. Start with this season if you like or pick them all up and work your way to it. Youll be glad you did. And perhaps youll start having your own Sunday dinners with your family.",1443484800,,5110,4.570960698689956

7295861,5,B00ZWC16CC,"My husband and I love this series.  Although it's a police show, it is not overly filled with gore, wild car chases and crashes.  The main characters are mostly family -- 4 generations -- and their interpersonal relations are as interesting as the stories.  They deal with the real issues of family relationships, different viewpoints, stresses increased by their work as police, and still maintain a stable supportive family life.  The police story part deals with just about everything you hear on the news, but it deals with it in thought provoking ways that present both sides of the issues with integrity.  Of the different ""crime"" series that we have watched, this is the best.",1443312000,2,683,4.904347826086957
