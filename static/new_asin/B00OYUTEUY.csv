8685544,5,B00OYUTEUY,"Dolores Faith is 105 in the shade.  Great movie!

Actually, all the women in this movie are 'pin-up types' not at the level of Barbara Eden or Sophia Loren, but ALL are very easy on the eyes.

This movie pretty much has everything. Rocket-ships with fire shooting out the back, a moon base, a cranky General on the ground, (has an overdeveloped secretary), spacesuits, lots of gadgets, and some very cute astro-babes.

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid $2 more for M-Disc, a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 10-15 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.  The video and audio quality is excellent on the disc.

This review is for the product I received from Amazon. If you are after a ""Pure Movie Review"", I recommend the ""International Movie Database"".  There, you will find reviews unrelated to the delivery mechanism.

Excellent movie. Well-written and well acted. NOT infected with the Cinavia DVD/Blu-ray virus.

I highly recommend this great movie.

BUY IT while you still can.",1525824000,,1179,4.928934010152284
8685545,5,B00OYUTEUY,I like sci Fi movies especially late 1950s and 1960 vintage ones,1470960000,,64,4.416666666666667

8685547,4,B00OYUTEUY,"Enjoyable enough and some unintentional laughs. Nostalgia buffs and the open-minded will find some entertainment in this movie.

A workaholic space station commander self-induces a nervous breakdown whilst a crisis envelops his ship. The rest of the crew takes up the slack to prevent a complete disaster.

The cute brunette reminds me of Morgan Fairchild. The pace is good, the acting is not bad, and the spacewheel commander is a hoot. Enjoy!",1440806400,,444,5.152777777777778
8685548,4,B00OYUTEUY,"Cheesy but fairly entertaining mid-60's sci-fi flick.  A lunar expedition, after a mission to the moon's ice caves, (now THAT would be a monumental find), inadvertently brings back a fungus that threatens an Earth orbiting space station.  The effects are minimal and some culled from other films, as is the background music.  The sets are bare minimum and dreary.  The acting is OK and by the books but the always upbeat hero is, after a time, a little hard to take.  I ordered a DVD-R from Amazon and the quality is at best fair, obviously taped at home.  The case cover is good though.  I like the artwork.  Hopefully a re-mastered will be released very soon. Otherwise recommended for fans of so-bad-it's-good sci-fi movie fans.",1440288000,4,731,4.792
8685549,1,B00OYUTEUY,"This is a homemade DVD. It has cheap cover insert and the DVD itself is pretty poor quality with artwork that is really basic.
I sent it back for a refund because nowhere did the add mention this was not a real release.",1439251200,2,219,4.116279069767442
8685550,5,B00OYUTEUY,"SCI~FI FANTASTIC FUN! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! YOU HAVE THE MOON, SPACESHIP, ASTRONAUTS~AND ONE ALIEN FUNGI TERRORIZING THE CREW! A PERFECT CREATURE-FEATURE TO GO WITH ""IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE"" AND ""GREEN SLIME""!",1427932800,3,216,5.78125
8685551,4,B00OYUTEUY,It is not for everyone.  if you love old scifi movie this one is not bad.  I remembered it from tv when it was on and had not seen it in over 40 years.  I was not disappointed.  it holds up better than some especially if you just want some fun and entertainment,1426291200,3,261,3.8679245283018866
8685552,4,B00OYUTEUY,"In MUTINY IN OUTER SPACE, the Rover 5 rocket is on its return trip to earth from the moon. They stop off at space station X7 along the way. While on the lunar surface, the rocket's crew discovered ice caves, which means a huge water source. The crew is bringing back some biological specimens they've found. Once aboard the space station, one of the astronauts comes down w/ a mysterious illness. The X7's doctor  and his assistant, Faith Montaine (the lovely Dolores Faith) find out that the illness is caused by a deadly fungus. The patient is quickly overwhelmed by the fungus and dies. Fearing a quarantine and an investigation, the X7's commander decides to cover up the incident, putting everyone at extreme risk. Meanwhile, a meteor shower has damaged the samples in the lab, causing the fungus to grow at an astounding rate! Now, it's a race against time to stop the fungus. Not surprisingly, the commander doesn't want to hear about it. This is when the title comes into play. MIOS is a fun-tastic sci-fi yarn from 1965. Though its budget was obviously miniscule, and the cheeeze-factor is high, it still manages to be engaging as well as entertaining. As old school space operas go, this one's a winner! Would make a great double feature w/ THE GREEN SLIME...",1424736000,2,1269,4.742081447963801
