5750717,5,B00CX7E96Y,"I like this stuff, most of these movies can't and wouldn't be made today, everything is too PC! Great collection, I laughed my ass off at most of it and I can imagine the best part of some of these flicks are the trailers!",1429315200,5,222,4.068181818181818

5750719,5,B00CX7E96Y,"As a fan of 42nd Street-type of movies, this is one of the best in showing trailers of different type of B movies from the early to mid 70's. With Fred Williamson giving a funny style of what we expect in black action heroes, he gives a look, in many different chapters, of what the blackpoitation series had to offer. Admittedly, if you have the whole series of either 42nd Street Forever or the Fantastic Movie Trailers, you will have already seen 90% of these trailers. If you don't, you're in for a real treat.",1395446400,7,514,4.421052631578948
5750720,3,B00CX7E96Y,"This is basically Fred Williamson introducting several clusters of trailers of blaxploitation movies.  The intro and several other inserts involving ""The Hammer"" are quite amusing.  However, I take this down a full two notches for the quality of the trailers.  I have seen maybe two dozen of these trailer collections, and I know I have seen better copies of some of these trailers than they managed to get here.  Some of these are so bad you can't even make out which ""main man"" is starring until you see the title -- because they are really blurry or dupey looking.  No doubt a few are no longer possessed of good trailers, but although I'm not interested enough to take the time, I bet I good find a better trailer or two for some movies than they've put on this compilation.  Entertaining mainly because of Fred Williamson (who looks great, incidentally), this could have been better.",1384041600,9,888,4.733766233766234

8587135,4,B00CX7E96Y,"Don't be like me and order this without carefully reading the product description. I thought this was a compilation of all the blaxploitation movies. But it is exactly as stated: a collection of clips and trailers. In that respect, it will provide you with a preview of movies you may want to order.",1495843200,2,299,4.660377358490566
