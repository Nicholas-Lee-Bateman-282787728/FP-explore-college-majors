7871995,4,6304413998,Green and crew  basically doing their best to show what us guys are made of. Of couse its done with clips from the show,1365984000,,119,3.9583333333333335
7871996,2,6304413998,This tape is less than half the length of the same titled show on a DVD leaving out  the funniest parts,1360195200,,103,3.9047619047619047
7871997,5,6304413998,"My family of six (ranging in ages from 5 to 52) loves this video.  The combination of word play, physical comedy, handyman hilarity, and dry humor is irresistable.  If this tape doesn't make your family and friends laugh out loud, check for a pulse. Long Live Uncle Red!",1035244800,8,270,4.604166666666667
7871998,5,6304413998,"These guys are really funny!  They make Tim Allen look like Mr. Rodgers.  If your a handyman, you have to see this, but be ready to cringe at the way Red treats ""tool safety"".  Their comments on ""what women  want"" shows just how alot of us guys  think (or don't think).  The  girls will get a laugh out of this for sure; and they'll give you something  to think about.",923097600,20,368,4.1571428571428575
