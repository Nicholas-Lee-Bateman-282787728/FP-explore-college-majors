This is the blurb on the description to tell you what this movie is about. Not much right! Will, I don't think that I can tell you too much more without giving things away. I am that guy who tried and succeeds in real life not to tell anything about a movie. But here I have to tell you something, the plane takes off, people die some passengers try to find the reason it is happening. Is this mystery worth sitting through, MEH, might be may be. I am a fan of Ryan Kwanten and did like his performance as well as Jerry Ferrarra, the rest of the cast well, it is a  mixed bag of the usual types and that includes the annoying ones.",1495670400,2,746,4.144827586206897

7616535,4,B01B1LE39A,"This is a mildly creepy ghost story that almost delivers a few chills intermittently.  The plot is fairly basic, strand a bunch of people on a plane bound for Tokyo.  Deal with only a few of the passengers, totally ignore the rest.  Things begin to happen mid-flight.  A mysterious man dies unexpectedly.  The plane is struck by turbulence.  Odd occurrences are noticed by the select few, so they decide to play Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys by investigating the dead guys luggage.  All they find are worrisome containers filled with hair, labeled with womens names.  And.  They find a sinister doll that chatters and moves of its own volition.

With a little more tinkering, this might have proved a worthy horror flick.  As is, its a bit on the tepid side, lacking any measurable scares.  Still, it has a few moments that I begrudgingly liked.",1490659200,4,845,4.712328767123288

7616537,1,B01B1LE39A,"This movie was so bad it was unreleasable in the U.S. It went straight to DVD in 2012 worldwide and didn't get a U.S. release on DVD until 2016. They knew they had a bad movie and shelved it for as long as possible.
As for the film itself, I would say just watch it if you're a fan of any of the key players. Amy Smart is a beautiful actress but chose not to be for this movie. Jerry Ferrara gives a good performance if you're a fan of ""Turtle"" from ""Entourage"". Nicky Whelan shows her talent as a versatile actress playing a bratty newlywed. She's a natural blonde wearing a brown wig to play the part. Nothing wrong with brown hair but it almost seems like the actors were attempting to conceal their identity for this film.
I would say watch this movie if you're a huge fan of ""The Grudge"" and ""The Sixth Sense"". Otherwise don't waste your time.",1487980800,,848,4.2407407407407405

7616539,4,B01B1LE39A,Not a bad film.  Reminds me of a tv movie.  It may have been.  It was a fst paced film and it did keep my interest.,1484870400,,115,3.3461538461538463
7616540,3,B01B1LE39A,"The basic premise of Flight 7500 is that onboard a passenger jet flying between Los Angeles and Tokyo, eerie and frightening supernatural events begin to occur over the ocean.  It's a good movie, though not without its flaws.  The main problem is it's too short - 80 minutes.  While there have been many great films of about the same length, Flight 7500  takes a lot of time setting up, which is not a problem in and of itself; what's wrong is that from when the serious supernatural starts happening to the end of the movie goes by too quickly.  Flight 7500 should, in my opinion, have been at least 20 minutes longer.  At the end it almost feels incomplete.

Okay, those were the minuses, now for the pluses.  It's a good concept and it's very well done in terms of acting.  There are some good angles in it - perhaps the best involves a mysterious carry-on parcel brought onboard by one of the passengers.  This item may be tied in with all that's going on, and once it's opened up it's pretty freaky.  There definately should have been a bit more screen time dedicated to these scenes.  The ending is good and pleasantly weird, although it is a tad abrupt.

I'm going to give this one three-and-a-half stars, which I consider a good rating, though not an excellent one.  Sitting here typing this and remembering certain scenes I'm tempted to bump it up to a four star, but I think I'll stick with the three-and-a-half.  If they ever come out with an Extended Cut (though that seems unlikely) I'll definately want to give that one a go.  As it is though, I suppose having ""it went by too fast"" is a less serious flaw than ""it just went on and on without ever getting good"".  Still worth a rent or buy.",1484697600,,1704,4.427652733118971

The ""creepy"" things that are herein have nearly nothing to do with the central plot and seem to have been added in hindsight because they needed a supernatural bent to make any of it watchable.

To top it off, what should've been ONLY a mystery-developing plot-point, is... Get this... Not only the movie's twist, but its ending!

In any other movie, the movie's ""twist"" would have been merely a jumping off point for a larger story/a mystery in need of being solved. But because Flight 7500 is so short and lacking in content/narrative purpose, it's its only ""gotcha"" gag and the only thing they could muster for anything resembling an ending in this boring drivel.",1466467200,,748,5.016129032258065

7616601,3,B01B1LE39A,"A whole bunch of talented people came together to make Flight 7500 (which is roughly based on a true story). The result is kind of a mess, but it's a more or less watchable mess. It starts with stock characters boarding a plane from L.A. to Tokyo, most of whom seem insufferable at first but a few of whom seem likable from the get go. Then a passenger starts going into convulsions mid-flight and seems to die (note all the times I am saying 'seems' here, there will be a quiz). Rather than take a furlough to the Pacific Islands to off-board his body, they stash him in first class and move all the first class passengers to coach. This should make any viewer start feeling suspicious. THEN a bunch of the first class passengers start making like the Scooby gang to try to find out who the dead guy was and why he is making their flight go all wonky. At this point the proceedings get downright silly. There is a reason for that, but the payoff, while emotionally affecting, doesn't quite make up for the discombobulated mess that came right before it. Also, while there are some arresting images and a few genuinely creepy moments, the movie is really not very scary. See it if you're a Ryan Kwantzen fan or a Takashi Shimizu completist.

If the AIRPORT movies weren't enough to keep you from flying, if the disappearance of flight 370 in Malaysia wasn't enough to finish off that fear then FLIGHT 7500 may make you finally swear off flying for good. It takes those elements of what happened and danger in the air and then combines it with the supernatural to make a movie thats safe for most to watch but will offer some truly frightening moments at the same time.

Flight 7500 takes off departs Los Angeles and heads out for a long trip across the Pacific towards Tokyo. As with most of the AIRPORT films we get a chance to know the passengers on board, to bring out that human element involved. A flight attendant is having an affair with the captain who promises hes leaving his wife. Two couples are on board in first class on vacation, one of which is dealing with the fact that all of their efforts to have a child have failed. A newlywed couple comprised of a harping wife and respectable husband are seated next to a tattooed and pierced rebel. A con man sits and fools with his cell phone even though hes been told that all electronic devices need turned off. These and others comprise the cast of characters on board the flight.

Shortly after the plane takes off but far away enough that they cant just turn around one of the passengers dies. This creates a lot of discomfort among the passengers and his body is taken to the first class area to keep him apart from the others and forcing those in first class to move. After his demise the passengers begin to wonder what he died from and if the rest of them are in any danger. Breaking into his luggage they find a ceremonial death doll, a Shinigami, a doll that is supposed to invite humans to death. Once found, things then begin to happen.

A sudden air pressure drop forces the passengers to strap in and put on their oxygen masks. Once settled more oddness occurs and each passenger has their own way of dealing with the events. The con man sneaks up to first class to steal from the dead body. The struggling couple attempt to find out whats really going on. The tattooed girl purports to find death fascinating but when push comes to shove is just as frightened as the rest.

Inevitably a realization is at hand before the end of the film and just what is going on is revealed. For some you will see it coming early on, for others it will come off as tossed in at the last minute. Ive read reviews where some have taken the film to task for not offering more clues early on. For myself I felt that the end was hinted at in various moments of the film but not enough to ruin it by making things apparent too soon. In so doing it made the film better for me.

While there are some scenes which might be a bit too much for young viewers for the most part the film can be viewed by the whole family. I say this when thinking of other horror films out there involving more blood and guts or sexual encounters. The end result is a film that offers scares via jump scenes and mood rather than blood spewing everywhere. Its not that those don't have a place in the heart of horror fans but its nice to see a more eerie offering at times. This movie satisfies those needs.",1462752000,,3250,4.319672131147541

7616638,5,B01B1LE39A,"I love this movie, and I've been dying to see this movie since I saw the trailer almost like four years ago. The thing I noticed instantly was that the trailer had more color than the movie itself. I'm assuming we've all seen and read the article of the dramatic difference between the gloomy Man of Steel verses the color pop some guy did to show off how much better Superman would have been had they not have done the gloomy and dark settings throughout the movie.
That's what I felt they should have done in this movie, it needs more color. The entire movie is dark, color is gloomy, and everything is dull. The reason I understand, because it works in with the meaning behind life and death, and all ties up in the end.
I hear there are different versions of this movie, and I noticed a few scenes that almost look like they are missing something. Like, the goth girl laying down in her chair... A ghost is clearly grabbing her blanket, and I was waiting for a jump scare when the checks as to what is grabbing it, but no... She makes her self more comfortable and goes to sleep. However not even a few moments later she's with the group and trying to solve what's going on. Doesn't make sense? Makes me think there was a scene that was taken out, that probably was a good jump scare.

I thought there would be a lot more back story with the strange man and the box. Instead they just sort of scratched the surface with a spooky doll. I mean, I understood the Shinigami aspect of the tale but I thought that there would be some kind of lore beyond the superficial 'people start disappearing one by one on a plane' synopsis.

They lead you to believe that there might actually be something scary going on, then they completely deflate that feeling with a crappy pseudo M. Knight Shammalammadingdong-esque twist which makes you feel like you wasted your time waiting for something to actually happen.

7616691,1,B01B1LE39A,"Here are some fun facts about this movie:

- Takashi Shimizu agreed to direct this film after his wife was kidnapped and held for ransom.

- All of the actors and actresses are real flight attendants, and did the film for free believing that it was a promotional ad for Air Nippon.

- The part where everyone was dead on the plane, but it kept flying, and the US Air Force had to send an F-16 to look in the windows and confirm that no one was alive, was based on a brainstorming session between the writer and a panel of three year olds.

- The turbulence scene, with the cardboard plane dangling on a string, was filmed by those same three year olds.

- The doll that clucks like a chicken, and kills the girl with the sequined shirt, was modeled after Courtney Love.

The history of the film is pretty interested also. It was filmed in 2008 but took five years to edit because all of the editors kept committing suicide. Then it was shelved with the intention of never seeing the light of day. A North Carolinian investment firm agreed to buy the film for $40 and one Casio Men's Classic Digital Watch (battery excluded). The film was released as-is, in Amazon Digital format, and the investment firm made their money back in 2 years.

Oh, we have a dead body on board and we're directly over a perfectly suitable airport.... but it's ""dangerous"" to divert?!

Also, there's no single seal on an aircraft that can cause a catastrophic decompression of a 747. period. it just... can't... happen.

7616701,3,B01B1LE39A,"I was just browsing to see if any good horror flicks were out and noticed this one by the director The Grudge. Trailer looked like this would be an awesome supernatural flick (which I am a buff of).  I rented it and watched it and had to rewatch it the next day to see what I missed the first time. After watching it the first time, started off very promising then as the movie progressed it got blurred with a confusing ending. So here it goes...
* Spoiler Alerts with a mixed up plot*
The movie starts out with a small passenger list on a big plane. Within a hour into the flight some strange man that owns a mysterious antique box dies very strangely and the captain decides not to turn back. Then it goes down hill (literally) for all passengers and crew. The main focus during the movie are 5 passengers and 2 stewardesses. The 5 main passengers consist of 1. A couple that are filing for a divorce who haven't told their friends yet who are traveling with them. 2. A couple who just got married and for their honeymoon decides to go to Tokyo. 3. A gothic style loner chic. The 2 main stewardess are very clear in the movie. During the first part of the movie the main characters are very well described along with some of their ""baggage"". (Blonde stewardess is having an affair with the married pilot who is flying the plane). Once the strange man dies things get weird for the characters.  They blame the stranger and go through his things and open the box that contains a creepy Japanese doll called Shinigami, a death doll/spirit that collects souls of people who die unexpectedly after letting go to whatever is holding them on earth.

My thing about the movie..
- The Shinigami..Good thing or bad?? No clue..to me I thought it would be good but the movie makes it seem bad.
- Very little special effects, like a B rated horror flick
- At the beginning was so clear and then it seemed like it just slacked to the end.
- Great concept of the movie to me...Don't dwell on little stuff, live life to the fullest cause nobody knows when time is up.
Conclusion: This movie had so much potential to be better. It was watchable but some of the scenes just confused me along with the ending. I give it 3 stars cause of the main concept.",1461110400,2,2238,4.3621103117506

7616704,4,B01B1LE39A,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

FLIGHT 7500 is one of those films you either love or hate, and judging from the ratings on IMDB, many people are not very fond of this one.  I am surprised, too, because I found this film gripping and intense.  Director Takashi Shimizu, best known for THE GRUDGE, SHOCK LABYRINTH 3D, and TORMENTED, skillfully blends together a supernatural mystery that will keep you guessing until the end.  If you can look past the critics on this one and give it a shot, I think youll be in for a fun surprise.

I confess I didn't see the end coming, so it caught me off guard when the big reveal was unleashed.  I love when a movie can surprise me, which doesnt happen very often these days.

The film boasts a great cast, with Ryan Kwanten from TRUE BLOOD fame headlining.  He is joined by some great talent, which includes Leslie Bibb, Amy Smart, and Jamie Chung.  Ive seen these folks in previous titles, and I have enjoyed just about everything they have done.

There are not many special effects in FLIGHT 7500, but those we do get to see are pretty decent.  My sole complaint would have to be the airplane itself.  A couple of the exterior shots make it blatantly clear that it is a CG plane.  Otherwise, things look good.

The story and the mystery within it are the biggest winners here.  Granted, some viewers will probably not like the twist, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I guess if I were forced to find a flaw with it, I would have to admit a couple of minor subplots are not explained.  These are small issues, however, and they do not hinder the film otherwise.

7616708,2,B01B1LE39A,"Flight 7500 departs Los Angeles for Tokyo and as the overnight flight makes its course the passengers encounter some sort of evil supernatural force.  Given the director, my guess would be a ""Grudge ghost.""

Our lineup of victims are moderately humanized and somewhat likable, but perhaps mostly because we recognize them from other HBO and horror favorites.  There is a couple (Ryan Kwanten; True Blood, and Amy Smart; Mirrors) embarking on a non-refundable couples trip with their friends who do not yet know they're getting a divorce, a mellow young man (Jerry Ferrara; Entourage, Battleship) and his recently wed bridezilla (Scout Taylor-Compton; Halloween) who is not fond of their goth and fatalistic row-mate (Nicky Whelan; Halloween II), and a flirty scheister seated beside an unimpressed young lady (Christian Serratos; The Walking Dead).  Meanwhile the flight attendants (Leslie Bibb; Trick 'r Treat, and Jamie Chung; The Man with the Iron Fists) gossip about the passengers and their love lives, one of which is involved with the adulterous pilot (Johnathon Schaech).  Essentially, everyone is either lying about something, angry about something, or in denial suppressing something.

Among the passengers is a man with an old wooden box of which he's suspiciously protective.  I'd be a bit clingy to my carry-on, too, if it had an evil Japanese spirit in it (or so I'm assuming that of the contents).  Shortly after takeoff he dies from a most violently protracted seizure.  By the end of the movie you will find no link to this completely unnatural seizure and any of the other events that shall transpire.

With a dead body on board people are harrowed, some even curious, but most reflecting on their lives having recently faced death.  It disappoints me to say that as some strange things start happening on the plane, I found more satisfaction from the development of the characters' relationships and self-discovery (not that there's anything special going on) than I did the horror story itself.  The formula is simple: 1) someone thinks she sees something, and 2) two passengers find connections when first they saw adversity.  The dead body creepily moves, and a troubled couple reflect on their poor decisions.  There's a lot of this interplay between interpersonal moments and failed attempts at scary happenings.  Speaking of failed attempts, a woman encounters a ghost emerging from the mist of the tiny airplane bathroom floor while taking a pregnancy test. Needlessly weird!

As the story stumbles into some state of development we learn of evil spirits of Japanese mythology that ""won't let go"" and thus do not move on to the afterlife. Apparently that's what's happening here.  There's also a weird twitchy ""death doll"" that doesn't seem to fit into all this at all.  And don't worry, by the end of the movie you'll see the doll meant very little.

The special effects are minimal, not in a ""minimalist"" way but in a really disappointing way.  Some CGI mist, spectral reflections, and reaching hands.  That's it.  Our victims deaths go something like thisthey hear something, a door or lid or suitcase opens, an out-of-focus figure or a hand emerges, the victim screams or whimpers, aaaaand cut scene.  We see no monster or ghost nor do we see an attack or a gruesome outcome--not even a horrific body.  Of whatever budget there was to hire the cast and create a huge variety of poster art (of the course of 3-4 years of release delays), it seems that hardly a dollar was spared to bring our monster to the screen.  As such, I now see why it took years to finally get this movie released.

I don't know what went wrong.  The well-respected director Takashi Shimizu (The Grudge 1-2, Ju-On 1-2) and writer Craig Rosenberg (The Uninvited, The Quiet Ones) brought together a sizable ensemble cast rich with horror experience.  This should have worked.  It seemed to have all of the building blocks of success, but once you hit ""play"" you'll find no foundation was built.

Very sad.  I wanted so badly to like this--especially since I've been waiting for YEARS to see ths.  My recommendation is that you don't even watch this out of respect for Shimizu or any of the cast you may like.  It's not worth it.  Not even a little.",1460764800,,4249,4.921348314606742

7616711,5,B01B1LE39A,I really enjoyed this movie... keeps you at the edge of your seat.  It's more of a psychological horror and not a slasher.  I don't know why there would be one negative review on this movie.  Great acting too!,1460764800,,209,4.3076923076923075
7616712,2,B01B1LE39A,"I had high hopes for Flight 7500. It has a solid cast featuring Ryan Kwanten (True Blood), Leslie Bibb (Iron Man), Johnathon Schaech, Christian Serratos (The Walking Dead), and Amy Smart. They make up part of the crew and passengers of Flight 7500, bound from Los Angeles to Japan, which experiences both physical and supernatural events during its long flight. The film was directed by legendary Director Takashi Shimizu who helmed such J-Horror standard bearers as the Grudge series (both Japanese and American versions) and Reincarnation. 7500 DVD

Shimizu takes his time developing many of the key characters and a central theme of fractured relationships. Brad (Kwanten) and Pia (Smart) have recently split up but do not reveal this to their friends who are taking them on the vacation. Laura (Bibb) is having an affair with the planes Captain (Schaech) and is looking forward to three days with him but also realizes he doesnt want to leave his wife. Liz and Rick are recently married and Liz is a stereotypical bridezilla snob who insists on showing her wedding photos to everyone on the plane. And Raquel (Serratos) who is travelling alone sneaks off to the bathroom to do a pregnancy test and prays it comes back negative.

A few hours into the flight the plane experiences heavy turbulence. A businessman carrying a mysterious box suffers a medical emergency and despite paramedic Brads efforts, he passes away. The crew tries to ease the panic among the passengers by removing the body. Ryan and Rick break into the mans box to find a strange, Japanese doll inside. Jacinta, a passenger who is into the Goth scene explains that the doll is death doll which is supposed to contain a spirit called a Shinigami that takes the souls of people after they die but only after they let go of whatever is holding them in the world.

Unfortunately this little tidbit makes the rest of the film predictable and silly. A handful of passengers begin to explore the plane while the flight crew, which seems exceeding small, disappears for long stretches. Everyone behaves in a completely unbelievable fashion. Shimizu infuses the film with little of the suspense and impending terror that he became known for on the Grudge series. His name on the film was the main selling point but Flight 7500 is an almost complete disappointment.

Shimizu does provide a payoffan ultimate onefor the various relationship dramas that were setup when the film started but it comes at the expense of a complete lack of horror. Not a good thing for a HORROR film and a respectable cast ends up being wasted.

7616713,4,B01B1LE39A,"IMDb lists three running times for this film: 97 mins, 85 mins and 80 mins. Please note the run time listed on this DVD is actually 80 mins. The run time listed here on Amazon as 1 hour 37 mins is incorrect. Apparently the film has been cut and as I write this review, the 97 minute version is unavailable. If anyone knows where to find it, please let me know.

Flight 7500 is a creepy, supernatural slow burn type of horror film. If you're afraid of flying, the impact of this film might be even more frightening. The film even pays a quick homage to the Twilight Zone episode called ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" and is remenicient of that famous Twilight Zone episode.

Flight 7500 takes place during an overnight flight over the Pacific Ocean. The passengers encounter what appears to be a supernatural force in the cabin. This is a well acted and directed film, but might not be for those who prefer their horror in a more rapid fire style. This is a supernatural ghost story that remains creepy throughout even when little action is taking place on screen. Watching this, one cannot help but think of the still missing Malaysian flight MH370. As I write this review, that plane was never recovered. Those familiar with the news reports of what may have happened on board will know what I mean.

Recommended for those who enjoy a solid, creepy atmospheric ghost story that slowly unravels to it's twist ending.",1460419200,34,1412,4.595238095238095
7616714,1,B01B1LE39A,"This movie was so bad I'm so disappointed! I waited all these years to see this movie and it was horrible! I just finished watching it, I was browsing new movies on demand hoping to see it and I did so I ordered it. I'm so glad I didn't go out and buy this movie. I was gonna order it on Amazon but thank God I didn't. This movie is just a waste of time. It started off ok but it just got really stupid really fast. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!! The trailer was scarier than the movie. So if you want a good scare watch the trailer for Flight 7500 because the movie is dull as dish water!",1460419200,2,583,3.907563025210084
7616715,3,B01B1LE39A,"This is gonna be the trip of a lifetime. When passengers board a plane bound for Tokyo they are filled with excitement. When one of the passengers gets sick they think nothing of it. Slowly those aboard begin to experience strange occurrences and excitement turns to fear when nobody knows what to expect, and there is nowhere to hide. This movie has a very made-for-TV feel and is a little cheesy in parts. All that said the movie is pretty entertaining and kinda fun to watch. There is really nothing all that special or original in this but it is nothing but fun and really keeps you interested the entire time. That is what a movie is supposed to be, entertaining and fun. This movie will not win any awards or even become a classic, but if you are looking for something to just pop in and veg out to, you could do worse than this movie. The only real misstep was the ending had a twist that came out of nowhere, and didn't really seem to make sense at all. Overall, entertaining, ridiculous and watchable. A movie you can just sit back and have fun with. I give this a B.",1457654400,18,1076,4.3316831683168315

I live in America, and the first time I saw this was in a preview in theaters FOUR YEARS AGO, and it NEVER came out in theaters like they said it would. It just did a disappearing act and was never heard of again until now. Why after 4 years are they releasing it on DVD instead of in theaters like it was supposed to be?",1456185600,8,396,4.089743589743589

7616718,3,B01B1LE39A,"I waited for a while for this movie to come out, when it sits on a shelf, thats typically a bad sign, but not definitive. Now Ive finally seen it, and fortunately, I did not hate it. The acting is mostly good and there are several familiar faces. The direction is also quite good and carries a very nice pace. My issue with the movie lies in the terribly clichd characters and flat story. While the director does a good job of keeping things mysterious, the movie is never once tense or frightening. Then the end hit, and I was very disillusioned. It was the obvious place to go and it was pretty weak. But up until that point, I was entertained. It was a good movie held together by the cast and crew despite the fact that the story was so uninteresting, thats an accomplishment in my eyes.",1455408000,16,791,4.315436241610739

When I've figured out the 'secret' before I'm halfway through a movie it kind of spoils the rest of it. The Grudge (especially the Japanese version)  is one of the few movies that have actually given me chills but I was sorely disappointed here. The ending was tragic but came as no surprise.

Everybody look what's going down.

Flight 7500 From Los Angeles to Tokyo. As with most mysterious stories such as the ones told by Agatha Christie we are introduced slowly and methodically to every single character of any significance to the story. Then we are introduced to just about everybody's back story right up front. There is funny people, creepy people, and a variety of other characters. It makes you want to kick somebody and get this thing started!

We get some turbulence; is this it? Is the plane going to go down before we even get started? No wait there is more. The creepiest character gets dispatched any most graphic way.

Now everybody scrambles to figure out what happened. Everybody confesses their most inner secrets. Are they about to die also?

There is one nifty spot where the people on the plane are actually watching
