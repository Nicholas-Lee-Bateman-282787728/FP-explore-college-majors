8150572,4,B000JJ4WJW,"Well, first off, this is the second volume of season one, not the second season. The third volume of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, or as I prefer to call it GX, is the third volume of season one, not the third season. I think some people were mixing up the volume number with the actual season. So far, Cartoon Network has shown both the first and second seasons on their line-up and they're currently airing the third season every Saturday. By the way, each season has 52 episodes. I just wanted to clear that up.

As for the episodes themselves, I personally think most of the episodes in this volume are actually better than some of the other episodes later on in the season. I've seen the whole first season on Cartoon Network when they first aired it and the begining was pretty good. The episodes and duels later on focus too much on the main character, Jaden, for my tastes and most everyone else doesn't do much of anything for a long time. The Tag Team duel was a pretty good way to introduce Syrus's issues with dueling and living up to what his brother has accomplished. Plus, he gets a nice bit of character development for a few episodes and that made me pretty happy because he's my favorite GX character.

Overall, a pretty good set of episodes. Personally, the actual second season episodes are much better and far more interesting than the episodes in the first season, but GX was just starting out then. Besides, if 4Kids is taking this long to put out the first season, who knows how long it will be before they'll release the episodes for season two. I recommend this to those who have seen some episodes of GX before, or for those who just want to relax for awhile by watching some okay to pretty good episodes of this series.",1177891200,5,1731,4.457413249211356
