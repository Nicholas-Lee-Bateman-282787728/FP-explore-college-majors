I think I know what he was going for with this film but it could have used a little more narrative to tie everything together. Its like horror ADD some scenes last only seconds. But I know very close to what kind of budget this film had and knowing that I applaud the effects, the break down was merely in the lack of overall story which could have been fixed very simply.",1430956800,,424,4.120481927710843
8711407,3,B00VVXCGDY,"I thought it would have a disturbing story and it does...  Just that it was so weird, disjointed, amateurish and low budgeted!  But yes, full of typical Edward Lee craziness (this time visual instead of written on the page) so if you're a fan of this visceral author then it's a must-see indy horror freakfest.",1429574400,,310,4.618181818181818

8711409,3,B00VVXCGDY,"Not totally sure what I just watched!  Not at all what I'd expect from Edward Lee -- Lee usually writes graphically detailed extreme horror with nothing subtle, off-screen, or hidden --  so I was expecting something along those lines.  Instead we get a little over an hour of pure surrealism... random images of headless naked women, naked women wearing freaky masks, naked women carrying severed heads, etc, all with no dialog or plot and shot through extreme filters that make it very difficult to actually see what's going on.  Every once in a while there would be a couple of minutes of some sort of plot, and then back to weird filters and random images again.

Lee is too talented to not have some freaky, disturbing stuff in there, but they last for a second and then we're on to another scene with a filter that makes everyone look like cartoons or something like that.

It was an interesting film, but anyone expecting to see some of Lee's writing come to life will be disappointed.  But if you are in the mood for a total mind-blowing, ""What the Hell am I watching?"" experience, then ""The Walking Woman"" is worth a shot.",1429315200,,1130,4.592039800995025
8711410,5,B00VVXCGDY,What is not to love about this? Erotic images and horror. Bless the dark mind of Edward Lee!,1428796800,,92,4.166666666666667
8711411,4,B00VVXCGDY,"Unique and remarkable for a low budget flick.  Loaded with T&A and macabre imagery! Never seen anything like it!  Highly recommended""",1428710400,,133,5.285714285714286
