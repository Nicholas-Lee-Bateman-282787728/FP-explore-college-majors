This DVD covers the history of Lotus.  It discusses each of the cars that they have

sold over the years.  Several of the people at Lotus are interviewed.  Also many

Lotus owners discuss their love for the company and the cars.  The owners are usually

shown beside their vintage cars with big smiles on their faces.

The DVD shows a modern day Elise being hand-assembled at the factory.  There is also

a nice section at the end with an Elise burning rubber on the track.

If you own a Lotus you will probably enjoy watching this DVD.  I certainly did.  If

you are not a car enthusiast you might not find the material engaging enough.  After

all it is not a Hollywood movie.  It is more like a bunch of car enthusiasts sitting

around talking about horse power and cool styling.

In this age of Blu-ray this DVD still manages a pretty sharp image.  It is a full

screen presentation.  Bonus material is 10 minutes long covering two interviews with

Lotus managers.",1269475200,,993,4.480225988700565
