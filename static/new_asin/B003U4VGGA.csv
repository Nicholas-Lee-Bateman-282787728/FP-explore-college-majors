8405633,3,B003U4VGGA,Slit mouth woman was ok.. it didn't make much sense was she dead already? Still alive or what? Also like when people got killed I noticed they were still breathing 3 times this happened. Next th slit on her mouth was really badly done . But why three stars well it was ok. The two main actresses where attractive enough and it kept me entertained. I bought this because it was cheap on sale and in a double pack for one I though slit mouth woman was actually carved a far superior story about the legend of the woman. Heck even carved 2 the scissors massacre was better than this movie. Next onto zombie dead.. I have not watched it all the way through yet but it looks to be quite good. Now the zombies look kinda dumb but other than that it has my interest.,1483056000,,759,4.205479452054795
