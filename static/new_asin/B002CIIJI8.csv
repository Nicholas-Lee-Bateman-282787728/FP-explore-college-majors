8363982,4,B002CIIJI8,"This is an older show that previously aired on the History channel probably back in the 90s so it is a bit dated, but was still worth the purchase.  Anyone who is a history channel buff or Bermuda Triangle theorist would enjoy this show.",1418688000,,237,4.386363636363637
8363983,3,B002CIIJI8,"This is a theoretical view of the ""Burmuda Triangle"" OK, the Burmuda Triangle is also Theoretical, this is just another twist on the story / legend / myth.
Interesting at some points and rather boring at others. It is at least a ""classy"" show, as most History Channel shows seem to be and worthy of watching if you are into this sort of thing. I guess anything is possible in this crazy universe.",1348272000,,396,4.438356164383562
