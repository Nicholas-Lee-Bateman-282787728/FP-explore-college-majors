994463,4,6305235074,"Once Upon a Time in China is a great introduction to the series.  It is an introduction to the main characters and the story line.  Jet Li stars as The peaceful medicine Wong.  His skills are known in the Mainland area.  The story talks of how peace is the ultimate goal, but sometimes we all  must fight a war to find the other side where peace lays.  The fighting  scenes are well done and though sometimes have a bit of randomness, believe  me, there is a plot.  The semi-negative portrayel of American's can be  equaled to the portrayal of Russians in James Bond Films...  Definitely a  must buy along with the other films in the series.",947635200,6,641,4.431034482758621

994465,2,6305235074,"The plot to the story was confusing and the movie dragged on for a long time.  Yuen Biao's character was dumb.  The fight scenes were so so.
 The final fight with the big boss was way too long. It was over kill, that  scene was either over edited or way under-edited. The movie gave me bad  memories, i kept having flash backs about the part where Fei Hong's 13 aunt  was about to be rapped.

994561,4,6305235074,"Part 1 is probably necessary background in this tilogy starring Jet Li, however Part 2 is my favorite and next Part 3 because of the wonderful performances of Max Mok.  Max is more of an actor than kung fu artist, however, he brings the needed comedy to the film as Foon and in Part 3 he is called Ah Foon.  Max is brilliant and at times outshines Jet Li with his performances.  Sadly in Part 3 Max's performance and scenes are scaled down in order to bring the focus back to Jet Li.  Whether or not this is Tsui Hark's idea or Jet Li is not clear, however, Max has done many other fine films.  Rosamund Kwan, lovely as always and a fine actress appears even after Jet Li is no longer the star in following Tsui Hark Once Upon a Time films.",1245888000,,740,4.146853146853147
994562,5,6305235074,"this film, made in 1991, is definetely a classic masterpiece. keep in mind that there this film was made on a small budget. martial arts films have gone through a definite transition since the 1990s. these films have never been made on a fair budget and have never celebrated the popularity that they have today. the sixtees and seventees were a terrible time for these films. the 1990s weren't really a good pick up either, until this film came along. though it is no exception to the budget problem back than, it does manage to have incredible visuals with great lighting and perfect sets. the films at this time were also subject to slight comedy that isn't usually accepted well by americans. again this isn't an exception for this movie but in this case its rare and it actually works to its benifet. the story is wonderfull because its fresh. The other ""once upon a time in china"" films weren't celebrated as well because they followed the same story.

but this film could stand alone because it has such emphasis on the story and emotional asspect (mind you, not as much as the more recent Martial Arts films) and the choriograghy was some of the best i've ever seen. they could even beet the more recent films like Hero and Seven Swords. a perfect 10 out of 10!",1234137600,,1269,4.565789473684211

I love the yin and yang of this charismatic character that remind us of the importance of harmony.

994565,5,6305235074,An Incredible kung fu movie! I recommend it to all martial arts lovers and fans of Jet Li. If one admires good kung fu fighting and interesting plot - this is it! This and the rest 2 parts of the trilogy are the best movies that Jet Li has done! I love it!,1207958400,,256,3.849056603773585
994566,4,6305235074,"I was definitely in the mood for Jet Li, and thus I grabbed ""Once Upon a Time in China.""  The movie is about Wong Fei-Hung (Jet Li) a Chinese martial arts expert who protects the Chinese people from the foreignors (British and Americans) invading his land.  Fei-Hung starts a militia to help protect the people, and they wind up getting in trouble by fighting with a local mob group.  Fei-Hung also runs afoul with the local Magistrate who is kowtowing to the foreignors.  Fei-Hung later fights with another martial arts expert, Iron Vest Yim, who wants to start his own Martial Arts school.  All the plots come to a climax on the American base, where the Americans shoot at the British and Chinese, while trying to steal Chinese women to bring back to America.  Yes, the plot is a bit out there, but the martial arts scenes are outstanding.  Especially the final fight scene between Fei-Hung and Iron Vest!
There is alot of comedy intermixed in the storyline also.  One of the funniest scenes, is where a Western camera is brought to Fei-Hungs house, and a picture is to be taken of him, another person and a bird.  The camera goes off with a boom, and the bird inside the cage is turned to fried chicken!  Pretty hilarious.
The picture quality is not the greatest for a DVD, but still very watchable.  How can you not love the martial arts scenes in this movie?
There are some extras on the DVD:

* There is a commentary from martial arts reviewer Ric Meyers.
* 5 movie trailers, including one for ""Once upon a time in china""
* Talent files for Tsui Hark, Jet Li, and Rosamund Kwan.  The files were a bit underwhelming, and they did not have a full bio for all of Jet Li's movies.
The DVD also has 2 versions.  The original Theatrical version and the English dubbed version.  I watched the cantonese version, with English subtitles which was fine!",1186185600,,1849,4.52710843373494
994567,4,6305235074,"Jet Li is Wong Fei-Hung, a Chinese leader, who is also skilled in martial arts.  Wong Fei-Hung is seeing the influence of the USA and England in China, and he attempts to learn some things about it in an effort to slow it down, since people he personally knows are enchanted by the allure of advanced technology and gold.

The film is set in the 1900's, as one of the supporting characters uses a first-generation camera for photography.  This film is about 20% action, 80% story, so it is not a continuous kung fu fest.  Jet Li was in his 20's when he made this film, so if you want to see what he was like before he became a superstar, this film is worth seeing-especially if you consider the low price it typically commands ($7-$10 brand new).",1183593600,,746,4.384057971014493

This has some great fight sequences and raised the bar for every martial artist movie that followed.  Jet plays Wong Fei-Hong who is revered as one of the most powerful icons of the this era in China.  He is the Chinese Wyatt Earp and is beloved in china.  Many movies have been made featuring this martial artist legend ( and featuring Wong Fei-Hong father) This is also the beginning of a huge martial arts franchise, the panicle is Part 2 where Li fights Kung Fu legend Donnie Yen.  this is a must for your martial arts movie collection and serves as the beginning of many great film by Jet Li.",1175472000,,695,4.315384615384615

994634,3,6305235074,"Although it is  the most popular series of six films starring Jet Li about a 19th C. healer and martial arts kung fu expert, it did not impress or thrill this viewer. There may be a serious disconnection with the way Chinese view films and how Americans like them. I need more mystery, a flow of action and suspense with unexpected surprises. I want a twist or two in the plot where hints are given of what may happen but then something else entirely different transpires. I want characters with complex natures who are presented with dilemmas that test their values, where the very core of their being is shaken. None of this is evident which is why I rate it three stars. There were intense superor kung fu moments for this I give 5 stars but that alone does not warrant a 4 star rating ...

The martial arts routines and fighting were phenomeonal, extremely well done, a pleasure to watch. The story and plot were so transparent, it was highly predictable and slightly boring. The lines were clear as to who were the good guys and who were the bad. Having viewed ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" my expectations for depth, creativity, and superb acting are very high. Those two films are like dining at a 5 star gourmet restaurant with exotic flavors and spices and this one is your local mom and pop diner where you leave with a full tummy  but know there is a whole other world out there ...

The opening and ending scene of kung fu exercises being done on a beach with the sun either risng or setting is great cinematography. The viewer is teased, hooked, impressed by the dance-like very disciplined movements. As the story unfolds, one sees how the Western influences are pitted against the Chinese traditional culture, with the Americans exploiting the Chinese as slave labor. It turns out, the local authorities are blind to the problems ... Wong Fei Hung (Jet Li) creates a local movement to fight neighborhood corruption. He is challenged by a disgruntled down on his luck kung fu expert, Iron Fist Yim (Yan Kee Kwan) who wants to establish a school of his own and put Wong Fei Hung out of business ... Wong Fei Hung is challenged by a distant gang who cause rebellions for which he is blamed as they establish authority in the area. His honor and reputation are at stake. Aunt Yee, a female relative by marriage but not by blood, returns from England, in Western styled clothes, who appreciates the technology and advances achieved in the West. Unfortunately, it seems each time she uses the camera with tripod to take a photograph, a bomb explodes (it gets to be funny by the second and third time it happens). Ironically, the first time, the pet bird of a restaurante owner is killed. It is a warning to him to pay protection money to the new group or he will die. The next time, a huge explosion occurs where a building is blown up and Wong Fei Hung's Martial Arts School is threatened ... Some rival gang is looking to establish a presence in Canton to exploit local fear, create instability and exploit the local population. Wong Fei Hung discovers Aunt Yee has strong romantic feelings for him - he initially resists but eventially yields to her charms, all of it is chaste and above board. She is captured by the enemy, nearly taken as a female consort to the Chinese slave workers in California who dig for gold. The Americans appear as bumbling one dimensional characters and conquerors with big guns  ... The Chinese come off slightly better however their culture is diminishing, nearly dying out as the common people are exploited inwardly by Chinese gangs and indifferent authorities while outwardly Western greedy forces destroy them. A home grown hero with solid values and the courage to act on his convictions is needed. He arises from ancient Chinese soil, his name is Wong Fei Hung who saves the lives of many, including Aunt Yee. There are many themes in this film which could have been explored with a better script and by a better director. Unfortunately this film is mediocre. It lacks passion and creativity.

994635,2,6305235074,"Alright, I'll confess to a slight infatuation with Jet Li, but even that did not make this movie more than passable. The plot is all over the place. It barely made sense - characters would suddenly arrive, locations would develop and then nothing would come of them. The bad guys were just silly - I like real malice and evil in my badies, I like to hate them and enjoy their come uppance. Well the silly twisted bad boy was just pathetic, and Jet Li, ever serene, was so far above the whole mess, so detached and lovely, just going through a very routine job of being Jet Li. The evil imperialist Yankees plotting to capture unsuspecting Chinese immigrants and enslave them were cartoon cuts outs.

Like every other enthusiast of this genre I enjoy the carefully choreographed fights and they were good, but not good enough to redeem this film. Give me Kung Fu Hustle any time - now there is quality!",1151884800,,901,4.52760736196319

Jet Li really does come through and does an excellent job in this stunning film. The action and story is excellent and very entertaining to watch. All of the costars are as equally incredible. The characters are those you really do care for and the locations in the film really are beautiful, it really does feel like you are watching 19th century China.

994639,2,6305235074,"Chinese martial arts movies have changed very little in the three decades or so since I first started watching them during the Saturday afternoon ""Kung Fu Theatre"" shows.  As a practitioner of Shaolin kung fu, I was drawn to this movie for its subject matter and because I'm a fan of Jet Li.  Jet Li did not disappoint, but unfortunately the rest of the movie did.

Jet Li plays Wong Fei Hung, an honorable martial arts master and physician who loves his country and respects the civil authorities.  In the face of exploitation of his people by British and American businessmen and soldiers, and the inundation of China by western cultural influences, Wong attempts a campaign of peaceful resistance.  After several violent run-ins with a local gang boss and, later, a challenge from a down-on-his-luck rival master, Wong is forced to fight for the things he values.  Wong's character is noble and stands in stark contrast to the wormy Magistrate, the low-life Tong, and the opportunistic Master Yim.

The storyline aside, though, the bulk of this movie was just plain hokey.  In true ""Kung Fu Theatre"" form, this story is replete with bad dubbing, slapstickish humor, cheesy dialogue, and overdone sound effects during the fight scenes.  For example, when Master Yim first meets Wong, he says something like, ""I've come to challenge you to prove that my kung fu is the best.  You'll have to fight me.""  Oy!  How cliche can it get?

The only thing that saves this movie is Jet Li.  Even with the use of wires and improved special effects over earlier generations of kung fu movies, Li's exceptional talent and prowess shine through.  That's the only thing I would recommend this movie for -- watching a true Shaolin master at work.  If you're not into that sort of thing, you're probably not going to like this movie very much.",1133740800,3,1827,4.789137380191693
994640,5,6305235074,"Westerners will not appreciate or understand the historical story line in this movie or how funny it is. Part of the problem is that the story was originally written in Cantonese for Hong Kong viewers who were well versed in the history and folklore of Wong Fei Hong. It was never intented for world-wide distribution and the translation of these films are unfortunately never good. What is funny to a Chinese viewer in Chinese is ""what...and huh, that was stupid"" to those who just isn't born to that culture.

994681,4,6305235074,"For all it's flaws Once Upon a Time in China is still one cool movie and a great introduction to Asian cinema for us misguided (and misled) Westerners.  Apparently Wong Fei-Hong is the equivalent of Davy Crockett crossed with Superman for the Chinese and throughout the film you sense the reverence for this man is not only sincere but almost religious in nature.

Jet Li plays Fei-Hong and he showcases his insane mastery of martial arts throughout this film( if there's one solid link between all of Jet Li's movies it's the believablilty of the fighting moves).

The sheer audacity behind some of the action sequences is astounding and often the result is staggering.  The choreography for the fight scenes is genius. You forgive instances where wires couldn't be hidden because it's so darn cool what you're watching.  American film makers have much to learn from the East regarding attention to detail when it comes to action on screen.

While the story is somewhat off, mainly in the laughable attempts at historical accuracy, it still piques one's curiosity and made me extremely interested in learning more about Chinese folklore.  Where in America profit is the driving force behind moviemaking Asia seems to lean toward the art of it and the difference shows.

I can guarantee that after watching this movie you'll see Asian films in a whole new light.  This stuff is addictive folks so be prepared to seek a new genre fix.",1111536000,12,1433,4.864197530864198
994682,2,6305235074,"After reading several reviews for the movie, I was compelled to see what the hype was all about. Unfortunately, what others may perceive as Hark's masterpiece epic, I only see as a mediocre film. It seems as if Hark couldn't focus what he wanted the film to be. He took stabs at action, adventure, comedy, and romance, but unfortunatly failed to do a quality job on any of those aspects.

If you're an action junkie and looking for a Jet Li martial arts flick, you better turn elsewhere. The few interesting fights are done well, but the film relies on a historical plot as it's backbone. For me, the storyline was sleep-inducing, but I suppose it depends on personal preference.

Yuen Biao's comedic performance, and the battle during the end keep this movie above a 1-star rating. Admittingly, I'm not a big fan of Hark, but I'm no detractor of his either. This movie just failed to inspire any interest out of this disappointed viewer.",1110326400,,938,4.678787878787879

The storytelling is practically absent, and is particularly difficult to follow when the dialogue is so terribly dubbed.  The fight scenes are adequate, but poorly edited.  Overall, this film is hardly worth renting, let alone buying.

The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk movies are infinitely better (and funnier).  Unfortunately, it seems difficult to find undubbed versions of these as well.  Is it that hard for people to read subtitles?",1108425600,,563,4.925531914893617
994684,5,6305235074,"I love this series, this is a truly master piece of kung fu movies, the choreography is just simply amazing, and director Tsu hark took the shot in truly entertaining way. Western viewers would be turned down by what's called the ""racial problems"", but come on it did happen in china so just suck it up baby,not as its a big deal nowadays, every country's politic was to expand their territory in the past, lets just face it.

For this movie, first of all this isn't the best in teh series. As for me the most entertaining ones are the vol2 and vol4 which in vol4 Jet Li wasn't casted, but the actor was about the same kind of martial art talent and the story was done a little better than vol3 for me. Lets come back to vol1 shall we, it's kindda long and a little boring for the first hours, it seems the whole crew is still searching the ""way"" to make this film which makes the cut a little dull, but the fight at end with Jet Li vs that guy who learned what was once called the ""IRON COAT"" in china was very visually entertaining, ""IRON COAT"" is a skill martial artist practice in order to train their body skin in order to sustain maxium damage much as possible, in tradition only artist has the skill to make ""one point hit"" which concentrate all the power to on one speicific pressure point can break through this kindda ""IRON COAT"" and familiars.

Odd dialogue given both good and evil are displayed in both chinese and westerners. Maybe something was lost in the translation to english. I cant read lips. I sure as hell cant read lips in chinese.

The martial arts scenes are terrific. Jet Li is, IMHO, the very best. Jackie Chan does stunts, Li fights.

994686,5,6305235074,"Finally, a pure kung fu movie that has a much deeper meaning than some type of revenge.  This film is one of the many stories of the chinese hero Wong Fei Hung.  It is about how western culture begins to influence the chinese and the rest of the world.  Times are changing and they must change with them or risk being left behind, but through all this must not forget their history and what made China great to begin with.

Packed with awesome fights and action, this is what set the standard for kung fu movies today.  Starring Jet Li in the role that launched him into action movie stardom, he displays his unmatched skill and talent of martial arts.  There are fight scenes throughout the whole movie involving one on one match- ups, group battles, weapons fights, and a final fight scene that can stand up to any other ever filmed.  This is also probably one of his finest acting performances ever!  There is very little humor in this film which is a nice change from the many comedy style kung fu flicks.  What little comedy there is is done perfect coming across as well timed and not just silliness as fans of the genre are used to.

Don't worry about getting the import version of the film as some reviewers say, this one has both the original subtitled version and the english dubbed version which is disappointedly around 20 minutes shorter.  Both are in anamorphic widescreen and have great sound.  The picture quality is slightly less than perfect but still better than many asain films made around this time.

Loaded with mostly realistic fighting and plenty of it(very few high-wire acts) fight fans will be in awe!  This is a must own for any action junkie!",1091404800,,1672,4.567114093959732
994687,4,6305235074,"Wong Fei Hung is an important figure, not only to Chinese history, but also to me as a student of the style, which he helped make famous. The Hung Gar Style is traced back to Hung Tsi Kwan (there are lots of debates over the spelling of his name) who taught Luk Ah Choy, and Wong Tai (Wong Fei Hung's grand father) who taught Wong Kei Ying (Fei Hung's father) who refused to teach Fei Hung, forcing him to turn to Luk Ah Choy for lessons. Fei Hung then went on to teach Lam Sai Wing (who is depicted in this film, albeit inaccurately) who wrote the book that more or less made the style famous. Hung Gar is a very common style in Southern China, but is very rare stateside with only a small number of schools teaching it. Wong Fei Hung is therefore a matter of great interest to me, which is why I bought this film without actually seeing it first. Lucky for me it ended up being a very worthwhile purchase.
 While some of the events of the film are based on real history (or legend) much of this story (and its sequels) remains a matter of fictional entertainment. Althogh Wong Fei Hung was married three times in his life, he was never involved with his by-marriage cousin (or 14th aunt if you're not watching the English dub), so introducing an arguably incestuous love interest is a bit odd, but the romance aspects of this film aren't really the reason to see this film, Jet Li and his incredible action scenes are. The action in this film was a landmark in Hong Kong Cinema and may have pioneered the ""wire fu"" so popular in today's movies. The story is very good as well, dealing with the idea of resisting change, and staying true to one's traditions and heritage. As a Kung Fu student and fan I love this movie through and through, as a critic, however I really wish the writers of this movie could have done something less awkward for a love interest for a man whose memory is revered not just in China, but to any and all students of the Hung Gar style. After all, Wong Fei Hung invented the Tiger Crane set that is now the trademark set for Hung Gar practitioners, and so it is a bit odd to see him portrayed in a potentially incestuous relationship. Still this movie remains at the top of the list for fans wanting to collect Hong Kong flicks, as it is one of the absolute best out there.",1086048000,,2301,4.3018433179723505

At the time of this writing I've seen Once Upon a Time in China parts 1-5, and essentially my feelings on the series can be summed up as such: There's Once Upon a Time in China, and then, there are the sequels. This is not to say that I dislike the sequels; in fact, I have yet to be entirely let down by a Once Upon a Time in China picture. But the original is unquestionably the paramount of the series, a martial arts movie which breaks through and transcends the usual limits of the genre.
The qualities of Once Upon a Time in China are manifold. Its story is sophisticated and densely layered for a martial arts film, its pace unrushed, its action satisfying, its length generous, and its climax genuinely gripping. Once Upon a Time in China is, indeed, the only movie in the series in which I actually felt genuine concern for the fate of any of the characters, or put another way, empathized any real sense of physical, emotional, or spiritual danger. Some will argue that the martial arts choreography of part 2 is superior, but for all their technical strength, part 2's action sequences lack the sense of harmony and resonance with the overall picture which can be readily found here. A strength of the series in general is that the action sequences rarely seem to be entirely arbitrary - but never in the many sequels are they fused this satisfyingly into the overall experience.
Additionally, I've noticed that the Once Upon a Time in China series has gotten more ""comic-booky"" as its gone along. I have no overt problem with these ""comic-booky"" aspects in and of themselves: the mysterious cult-leaders and quasi-supervillains of parts 2 and 4, or the pirates and treasures and gunfights of part 5, or the introduction of the Clubfoot character in part 3, are all entertaining in their way. But I do appreciate the slightly more down-to-earth atmosphere of the original, as it seems to have been conducive to the development of more interesting characters. While there are other antagonists I've enjoyed in the series, none have come close to matching the thorough spiritual bankruptcy and cruelty of this film's Shaho gang leader. He has no special powers or tricks - in fact he doesn't even prove to be a particularly formidable fighter - but he's the only villain they ever bothered to develop enough so that you really come to despise him by the end.
And what of Iron Robe Yim's nuanced part in the tale? Not quite a villain proper, more a tragic figure - but an interesting tragic figure, and one successfully interjected (in place of the Shaho boss) as a formidable martial arts antagonist, thus allowing for the film's classic final battle. Above and beyond this he is also nicely interwoven into the greater fabric of the tale's many moral quandaries by his temporary relationship as mentor to Foon. (Incidentally, the mentor/student relationship between these two characters would have been well served by just a bit more development, but when everything comes to a head in that last half-hour, it still manages to pull itself off nicely.) Yim occupies an interesting space as a character in this story, a space unfilled in subsequent Once Upon a Time in China chapters: he is a character who we feel could have been great, could even have been a friend or brother to Wong Fei Hung and his coterie, but who sadly crumbles (under the pressure of poverty) to his darker, greedier side, and pays the price in a bloody and undignified demise - (a scene which proves powerful on several levels.)
Without getting into each in detail, I appreciate this film's well-rounded cast of characters, several of whom disappear and/or are replaced by different actors in subsequent Once Upon a Time in China films. With the exception of the unused Kai, every major character is given his moment(s) in this movie. Even Buck Tooth So - a character I initially found too annoying and zany - manages a convincing emotional and moral complexity by the end (relative to what you'd expect of such a character, at any rate.)
Last but not least, I should probably reaffirm that Jet Li himself is indeed excellent in Once Upon a Time in China. He brings a poise, dignity, style, and romantic vulnerability to the character of Wong Fei Hung which I doubt I'll ever see matched, and his focused and perfectly executed martial arts are a thing to behold.
So when all is said and done, I feel I must insist that Once Upon a Time in China has far more going for it than any of its sequels, and manages not only to juggle everything successfully - action, romance, politics, religion, national identity, melodrama, and brotherhood - but also to bring it together into a climax far more satisfying than anything I've seen from the series since. It boasts competent, artful direction, good production values, a fully realized 19th century environment, and everything in the film radiates with a glow which even the best of the sequels never quite match.
DVD REVIEW:
The Columbia TriStar release of Once Upon a Time in China is, to my mind, the most adequate of their three OUATIC releases. Picture and sound are both reasonably good, format is original widescreen, and the subtitles are clear, well-placed, and well-paced. The Cantonese and Mandarin audio tracks are both included. The English dubbed version is included as a special feature. Other special features include an interesting audio commentary (albeit it from a somewhat annoying and occasionally sarcastic commentator) and a few trailers. Nothing exceptionally mind-blowing, but a worthwhile purchase for sure. See Amazon info for more technical details.",1043884800,6,5618,4.834890965732087
994689,2,6305235074,"1 star for the displays of Jet Li's impressive skills. 1 star for some really evocative scenic shots.  Other than that, this movie is a disappointment.
The story jumps all over the place.  Characters are introduced, developed, and dropped from the story seemingly at random.  You can piece together what is going on, but it's painful.  This isn't to say that the story isn't good, it's that the storyTELLING is terrible.  A ham-fisted, amateurish attempt at movie making.  Bruce Lee's ""Fists of Fury"" (as an example) is a superior movie simply for managing to present its plot in a half-way coherent manner, and it's so much older.
If all you care about is the Kung Fu action, this movie has it in spades.  If you are at all concerned with what holds the fights together, you may want to rent this before you buy it.",1043107200,,816,4.586206896551724

Not only Jet Li's best movie, but along with Bruce Lee's the Chinese Connection aka Fist of Fury, is probably the greatest martial arts film of all time.

994724,2,6305235074,"The bad news first -- this DVD transfer is awful!  Unless you enjoy getting eye strain from unconsciously squinting through the whole movie (hoping that'll improve the picture quality), don't buy this DVD!  Columbia TriStar really deserves a beating for this one.  So how bad is it?  There are motion artifacts galore, and even in still pictures everything is somehow blurry or double.  In panning shots of a ship, diagonal ropes on the ship are not only jagged, but blurry almost beyond recognition.  A shot of ships in the harbor is so blurry that the ships appear to have extra mast pieces.  Faces in the background appear blocky, almost like an enlarged JPEG image.  I don't know why this movie was released in anamorphic form, since it appears to have even less resolution than a letterboxed movie!

And then there's the audio.  It has Cantonese and Mandarin language selections, as well as a dubbed English version.  Well, guess what?  Both the Cantonese and Mandarin versions have been dubbed also!  Where is the original sound?  I find it hard to believe that the entire soundtrack of this movie was replaced with overdubbing before it was released!  [EDIT:  Now that I know better, I find it much easier to believe.]

OK, if you still must have this movie, either buy it on VHS or never watch it on anything larger than a small TV so you won't notice how awful the picture is.  And if, after all this warning, you still must buy this DVD, then just remember:  I told you so.",1025049600,10,1483,4.634615384615385
994725,5,6305235074,"In the inaugural film in this series, martial arts film legend Jet Li stars as Dr. Wong Fei-Hung, a real life folk hero of 19th century China.  Combining solid martial arts action (as you'd expect from a Jet Li movie) with an equally solid storyline which delves into actual historical elements, this movie is a winner all-around, thus justifying the Hong Kong Film Award that it received.
THE STORY:
It is 19th century China and Western influence is growing in China bringing with it both good and bad elements.  Dr. Wong Fei-Hung, a noted martial arts instructor and doctor, as well as his countrymen must contend with the expanding influence of the West.  The country is in turmoil.  A band of Chinese slave traders, who sell their own countrymen to American slave traders, both for labor as well as female prostitution, arises and Fei-Hung must put a stop to them when his own favorite aunt, (a Westernized Chinese girl) Aunt Yee (Rosamund Kwan) is kidnapped by the slave traders.  Added into this mix is the fact that Wong Fei-Hung and his school of fighters are considered outlaws by the local government and are hunted and imprisoned and also the fact that a rival martial arts master, Iron Robe Yim (Yee Kwan Yan) arrives in town to challenge him.
THE COOL STUFF:
If you love martial arts action you've got TONS of it here.  The fight scenes are NUMEROUS and ELABORATE as you'll be treated to tons of fighting set in 19th century China is tons of marketplace settings as well as vintage Chinese dwellings and buildings.  The sets and costumes are just awesome.  The fight scenes between Wong and Yim are just awesome.
THE DVD FEATURES:
The features of the DVD, while not extensive as most new DVDs are, are perfectly acceptable.  Included on this DVD are the following:
1. Commentary Track by Hong Kong film expert Ric Meyers.  Tons of great inside info.
2. Bonus Movie Trailers for the following:
a. Once Upon a Time in China I
b. Miracles by Jackie Chan
c. Who Am I? By Jackie Chan
d. Gorgeous by Jackie Chan
e. Gen X Cops
3. Filmographies for Director Tsui Hark, Jet Li and Rosamund Kwan
THE VERDICT:
The most common criticism for most martial arts/action flicks are that the stories [stink].  The redeeming quality for them is, of course, the action.  Once Upon a Time in China overcomes these criticisms by delivering solid action and (lo and behold) a GREAT story.
Besides oohing and aahing to tremendous fight scenes you'll also be treated to a great look into a crucial period in Chinese history.

There are several sub plots including the US capturing or even having people pay to go to the land of opportunity (US). Jet is Wong Fei - hung, arguably the most beloved character in books, movies and TV. (Is there anyone in Chinese films that has NOT played Wong Fei - hung?) There is a great fight or ""non fight"" in a restaurant that is Jet at his best!  Biao has a smaller part but at least the director doesn't make him pass out like some directors we know.  It is good to see him in action with a director who is not concerned about personal ego.  This is rare for Biao, don't miss it!  Kent Chung is the portly butcher and is wonderful! Rosamund Kwan is beautiful as always but she has brains too and helps the cause of the Chinese people when she can.  I did get a little tired of the wire fu..one fight scene in particular where this GIANT log is being kicked around by Jet and his opponent.  I swear you can see the cables on the thing!  When oh when is Hong Kong and the US for that matter going to let martial artists like Jet do their stuff! Wires used to enhance or for safety are fine.  But Jet and Biao do not need wires to wow the audience!
Buy this film!  If you like Chinese period films and/or martial arts you will love it!  I can only reccomend the full HK DVD with Cantonese or Mandarin languages , and subtitles in English.

To this day the final fight scene still has new viewers of this movie reduced to wide eyed stares and grunts of disbelief.  One note about that final fight though, it's my understanding that Jet Li broke his leg before the scene and that Xin Xin Xiong actually did all the tricky scenes on the ladders.

994770,5,6305235074,"The ""Once Upon A Time In China"" series IS the best kung-fu series ever made. It includes Chinese history, and the struggles Asians made trying to keep their culture from being ruined by Westerners.
Kung-fu international star, Jet Li (who began learning kung-fu at the age of eight) gives an astounding acting performance with integrity and passion. He, who plays Wong Fei Hong in numerous of his movies, brings Asian pride to the screen, but more importantly, a moral that is important to everyone. A moral that says, ""Embrace your culture. Don't let it die.""
Of course, the music can not be forgotten. Starting from the opening scene, the score of the ""OUATIC"" series is beautiful. In fact, any Asian or any kung-fu movie fan will know the Wong Fei Hong theme.
Jet Li proves with the ""Once Upon A Time In China"" series that he definitely deserved the many championships he won at kung-fu competitions when he was very young. With his no-shadow kick, and swift and graceful kung-fu, Jet Li manages to back up his kung-fu with superb acting that is obvious even when he is not fighting. Jet Li brings another message across to an audience with this classic series - for he plays Wong Fei Hong, who only uses fighting when absolutely necessary. Wong Fei Hong is a character that is so well-respected because he is a man of righteousness, and a man who will do anything for his people. This film is of deep integrity, original fight scenes, and plots that you will never forget. The kung-fu sequences themselves are reason enough to watch the series endlessly. - Priscilla",993686400,,1569,4.7299270072992705

994811,4,6305235074,"First of all, the movie: let me start off by saying that you should not try to compare this movie to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" anymore than you can compare the 1920s movie ""The Lost World"" to the modern, Spielberg-directed and CGI-enhanced ""Lost World.""  And while some of you may say that in the latter example there was a much greater time gap between the movies, my point is that Hong Kong cinema has gone through drastic changes over the past decade, with many of the current crop of movies sporting high production values--""Storm Riders"", released a couple of years ago, was one of the first (if not THE first) HK movies to use Hollywood-quality special effects and CGI, and many subsequent movies have tried to follow suit (e.g., ""The Duel"", ""Man Called Hero"").  In contrast, ""Once Upon a Time in China"" was made on a much, much smaller budget, but is generally considered a classic martial arts movie, and the one that not only propelled Jet Li to stardom, but also revived a genre that had long gone stagnant.
Personally, I believe that this is one of Jet Li's best movies (I've seen them all), especially if you're looking for a movie which best showcases his terrific martial arts ability.  In this movie he plays Wong Fei Hong, a Chinese folk hero who has been depicted in hundreds of movies by dozens of actors, but by Jet Li for the first time.  He is joined by a well-known Hong Kong cast (e.g., Rosamund Kwan, Yuen Biao, etc.).
The DVD: no, the video image is not of five-star quality, but I don't see why so many people are complaining.  I've seen at least 50-70 Hong Kong DVDs over the past year, and most of the time the quality is poor to mediocre at best.  Here we have an American release which may not measure up to current releases like Fight Club or Toy Story, but which is still head and shoulders above its Hong Kong counterparts (most of which are still much more expensive to acquire).  Yes, the sound is in 2.0, but it's the visuals (e.g., fight scenes) that are the center of this film, not the audio.  And there is a dubbed English track for those who resist reading subtitles (I've never listened to it, though, as I hate watching poorly-dubbed movies more than I hate reading subtitles).  Plus, since this is an American release, the subtitles are much, much better than most you'll find in your average HK DVD.
But perhaps the best feature of the DVD is the commentary by martial artist and HK film expert Ric Meyers.  Some critics have complained in the past that this movie can be inaccessible to viewers not familiar with (1) Hong Kong movies, or (2) Chinese history.  Ric Meyers does an excellent job of guiding the viewer through the movie, explaining some of the smaller details like (1) the purpose of the Lion Dance at the beginning of the movie, or (2) the importance of the ""queue"" (spelling?), which is the Chinese male's pony-tail.  These are all significant to the movie and their respective scenes, but can be all-too-easily lost on the average american viewer.  Plus, Mr. Meyers provides some good background information on the actors and their characters.
In sum, this is a good DVD of a classic HK movie at an exceptional price.  I believe it's the perfect introduction to HK cinema, as it has probably THE leading HK actor (Jet Li) playing the most famous movie figure in HK cinema (Wong Fei Hong) and is directed by one of HK's most famous directors (Tsui Hark).  Add to this the very informative commentary track, and you can't go wrong.",982627200,49,3498,4.601286173633441
994812,3,6305235074,"I merely confirm what has been already said: this is a great martial arts movie (one of my very favourites) that has suffered horribly at the hand of whoever did the DVD transfer. I'd recommend the movie to everybody but not so much in a DVD form. Perhaps other DVDs available in Asian market or in UK would do a better job, because I can't imagine, especially in regard to its sound quality, it being any worse than the region 1 disk.
BTW, Aunt 13 is actually the ""13th aunt."" She is apparently the 13th daughter of somebody of the same seniority of Wong Fei Hung's grandfather (either in blood or in martial arts apprenticeship). So she's actually an ""aunt"" to him but obviously of simliar age.",982454400,,696,4.488188976377953

Sadly the American Region 1 DVD fail to do justice to the film. Picture is muddy and sound is mono. Even the english dubbed version suffers from  near total darkness. Sound is only mono and not a very good one at that. It's even worse than the Region Zero available in the Asian market. I recommend the UK Region 2 instead.

994888,5,6305235074,"Jet Li has had a knack for making some of the best modern movies about historical China.  This movie is no exception.  While there is not a lot of martial arts action, when there is, it's great!
The film does a great job as portraying the influence of western society in turn of the century China.  The only beef I have with this movie is the antiquated firearms used.  This takes place during the late 1800's, but all of the americans are using revolutionary war flintlocks.  No 6 shooters or Henry rifles like you'd expect.  Oh well, doesn't effect the movie so like I said, just a beef.
Jet Li has done a great job in this movie, if you liked the Legend of Fong Sai Yuk, you're sure to like this one too.
I just want to know why she's called Aunt 13?!?",981417600,3,755,4.208333333333333

Plus the point of view is enlightening in that it presents history from a non-Western point of view.  The DVD is light on extras, but the commentary track by Ric Meyers is informative and interesting.
I do have to comment on the earlier review that said to forget ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  The person who wrote that review doesn't get it, or is only interested in one-dimensional film making.  ""Crouching Tiger,..."" is an instant classic, because it contains more than just superior martial arts action - it has a timeless, epic fantasy story, great acting, and excellent cinemetography.  ""Once Upon A Time In China"" set the standard for it's day; ""Crouching Tiger,..."" raises the bar even higher.",980899200,5,858,4.965034965034965
994890,5,6305235074,"Forget the overrated Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. For a superior, purer taste of Chinese culture and filmmaking, see this brilliant genre epic from Hong Kong mega-director/producer Tsui Hark (he helped John Woo & Chow Yun Fat become Asian superstars with A Better Tomorrow and the Killer). Jet Li plays Master Wong who helps defend China against foreign devils and traitors within. We get a superbly entertaining display of beautifully choreographed martial arts mixed with an informative pop-culture savvy interpretation of Chinese history. This is the real deal. A classic. I also highly recommend Tsui Hark's Peking Opera Blues & A Chinese Ghost Story.

Eventually they boil over and what unravels is what happened Once Upon a Time in China.  This story really has it all and Li(in the role that made him a star) is magnificent.  I gave this movie 5 stars based on its rank of Hong Kong martial arts flims I have seen.  I highly recommend it to any fan of action films and particularly to Jet Li fans.",972345600,2,692,4.359375

The film itself has a strong plot and could hold up against some of the best dramas in Hollywood. A for the DVD itself, picture is O.K for a film that is shot 10 years back and it includes trailers and some of Kwan Tak Hing's fight scenes(the 60s' Wong Fei Hung). There's even a booklet surrounding the real person and the actors who potrays him. In the audio department, it's a little dissapointing as some of the sounds sound a bit muffled.

I wanted the VHS version, but it was too expensive..so now that the DVD version is out, although it's still expensive I think it's worth it. The part I love most about the movie is how the movie portray the AMERICANS as really DUMB villians. All you see in hollywood today is minorities playing the stupid role of the villian.

7885708,2,6305235074,"ATTENTION, THIS IS A REVIEW/RAMBLE ABOUT THE SONY/COLUMBIA-TRI-STAR REGION 1 RELEASE.

Where to start???  HMMMM... This release has: ""Americanized"" trailers for this film & others such as Gen-X Cops and some Jackie Chan films, Text bios, and two versions of the film. The HK theatrical cut (DD 2.0 Cantonese and Mandarin Mono), and the shorter UK/US cut (DD 2.0 English Stereo) both in 2.35:1 16:9 widescreen. Judging by the Media Asia logo that pastes over the Golden Harvest logo, it appears the HK version uses the same master as on the non-anamorphic 1999 Mega Star release.

If you own or have seen the old Mega Star release, be prepared for some lowly third rate picture quality. That release is made from a PAL format Media Asia video master that is interlaced and has compression issues and artifacts. The Sony/CT release uses that same master, but converts it into NSTC 24fps, zooms it into 16:9 and encodes it progressive with the incorrect flagging that results in weaving and staircasing. The reason why the image is so soft is because of the 16:9 zoom on this weak and blurry non-anamorphic print. Both audio tracks are very poor all around, but because the film was recorded in mono and not preserved very well, its likely a source master issue.

Now we have the US/UK version, which is different than the HK version in terms of running time among other things. It runs about 18 mins shorter, is English dubbed, and has English titles/credits. The source quality is in rougher shape than the HK version and uses Media Asia materials judging by their logo at the beginning. However, unlike the HK version this uses a proper progressive transfer from what appears to be a 35mm source rather than a tape master, meaning it is free of interlacing issues and artifacts. Like the HK version, the English audio (and dubbing) is not only in poor quality, but it sounds worse than the former.

THE VERDICT: Trite extras and lame trailers. The HK version is visually UNWATCHABLE unless you view it on a SD CRT TV, though the mono audio is sus. Ironically, the shorter UK/US version is visually WATCHABLE, but keep the volume really low or mute it with subtitles, because its not the hollowness of the dubbing but rather the quality of the English audio source.

As far as better releases go, there's the Fortune Star/Zoke Culture DTS DVD (Region 0, NSTC), the Kam & Ronson Blu-Ray (Region ALL), the French Universal DVD (Region 2, PAL), and the Hong Kong Legends DVD (Region 2, PAL). The DTS track on the Fortune Star release is REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD, but the Mono audios' been nicely restored and has good PQ. The UK release has the best extras, but is cut by the BBFC for horse falls under their animal rights act of 1937.

For those who are stuck with R1, there is also another US DVD put out by BonZai Releasing. It uses the Fortune Star HD print of the HK version, with nice PQ in Scope OAR 16:9 and has both the HK trailer and the cheesy ""NEW"" trailer. There is one problem with this release, it only contains an English 5.1 track consisting of a new dub which isn't too bad in terms of performance and acting. Those who are seeking the original Cantonese audio here will be peed off, but at least for R1 this is better than the Sony release in terms of A/V quality.",1383436800,2,3314,4.616298811544992

7885710,5,6305235074,"If you are looking for a heavy action, heavy kung-fu movie, look elsewhere. Those of you who only want that won't like this movie. I personally love it, but I understand it is not for everyone. This movie is about the history of a legendary man, as well as the history of China. This movie has some action and kung-fu because Wong-fei Hung was also a martial artist but he was first and foremost known as a doctor. This is an extremely funny movie however not if you watch it in english (in other words, you need to know chinese, sorry whities)",1309824000,,544,4.3431372549019605
7885711,5,6305235074,"Director Tsui Hark successfully brings the Wong Fei Hung film franchise into the 1990's. Wong Fei Hung was a famous folk hero in Chinese history. Everyone from Kwan Tak Hing to Jackie Chan to Jet Li to Sammo Hung has played him. He was a doctor and a martial artist. He ran a school and clinic called Po Chi Lam. Wong Fei Hung is not only a hero, but a Chinese hero. Once Upon a Time in China(a.k.a. Wong Fei Hung) takes place in 19th Century China. The immigrants from around the world are altering China's culture. Tsui Hark satirizes this in a scene where Chinese musicians struggle to preserve Chinese culture. Wong Fei Hung must rescue Aunt Yee after a slimy gangster tries to sell her into prostitution.
 The Chinese actors in the film do a good job acting, but it's obvious that some of the gweilo(foreign) actors are giving hammy performances. Well, these were just foreign people living in Asia at the time. Rosamund Kwan plays Wong Fei Hung's Westernized ""Aunt"" Yee. The action scenes in Once Upon a Time in China are superb. The climax was ripped off in The Musketeer(2001). Butcher Wing, Ah Foon, and Buck Tooth So are Wong Fei Hung's students and they're just as colorful as Wong. The music score for the film is excellent. Hong Kong movies have limitations and Tsui Hark spared no expense to put rain, fancy camerawork, and atmosphere into his film. The English dubbed version of the film is 30 minutes shorter and re-edited. OUATIC is serious and the series slipped into farce and camp over the years. Once Upon a Time in China is one of the best Hong Kong movies from the 1990's.",1308096000,,1595,4.557491289198606
7885712,5,6305235074,"Jet Li stars in his breakthrough role as turn-of-the-century-China's infamous Wong Fei Hung, master of kung fu and herbal medicine.  This is the one that really put Li on the map, along with director Tsui Hark (""Knockabout"").  There have been innumerable films made about Master Wong dating back several decades, but none like this, before or since!  This movie is epic in its depiction of the beauty and art of China and claustrophobic in its imagery of the chaos and confusion that was going on at the time.

China is in turmoil.  The world is changing and China is being left behind.  The major powers of the world wish to exploit the country's citizens and natural resources and have overrun the port cities with promises of better lives elsewhere, often hiding more sinister agendas, like slavery and prostitution.  Some citizens are for change, others are outraged by it.  Master Wong doesn't know what to think, and many of his students are getting caught in the madness.  A help and a hindrance comes to visit in the form of his westernized aunt, by marriage, Yee (Rosamund Kwan, ""Armour of God"").  She has an education from England and feels China needs to change.  She and Master Wong have a mutual, unspoken attraction, making her influence hard to dismiss.  When local gangs start helping foreigners gather victims for their evil schemes, Master Wong must swing into action.

This movie is almost perfect, marred only by its overlength, occasional Peking-Opera-inspired ""humor"", overuse of wires (mostly in the latter 3rd) and the casting of two magnificent screen fighters as dudes who can't fight, made even more frustrating by the fact that they fight each other!  Yuen Biao (""Eastern Condors"") as Foon and Yau Gin Gwok (""South Shaolin Master"") as the Shaho gang leader.  Admittedly, had I not known who these dudes were, it would not be a complaint at all.  The casting of old-school baddie Yen Shi Kwan (""Fearless Hyena"") as a rival master of Wong Fei Hung helps make up for it!  The fights really show off Jet Li in some of his very best work.  Fast and precise, he adds a beauty rarely seen while beating the tar out of someone!

Also on the rare side, the non-fight moments are typically insightful and/or interesting.  Even the romance between Wong and Yee (Cousin Yee or Aunt 13 in some versions) doesn't feel forced or exaggerated, giving them kind of a detached playfulness in one another's company.  Rosamund Kwan is not only a good actress but an interesting example of beauty: I have seen her in several films and she is NEVER unattractive but sometimes blends into the background in minor roles.  Yet, one slight change of hairstlye and you can't take your eyes off of her! Here, her role is larger and more in-depth and she makes the most of it.

Ahh, glorious widescreen!  This version from Columbia/Tristar is wonderful with remastered picture and sound, languages in Mandarin and Cantonese (there IS an English dub, appearing as a special feature) with subtitles available in English, Spanish, and French.  The other special features are limited to trailers and talent files with one notable exception: audio commentary by Hong Kong film expert Ric Meyers.  If you love martial arts movies and have even a slight interest in Chinese history (though the movie is mostly fiction) this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
