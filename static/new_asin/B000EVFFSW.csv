8114772,5,B000EVFFSW,"This DVD is well made, good sound and image. The story is about Skeena, the train that runs between Jasper, Alberta and Prince Rupert, BC. The scenary along the route is magnificent and the DVD presents it through the eyes of tourists that take side trips along the route. The DVD gives the viewer a very good idea about what to expect in that part of Canada, and achieving that it receives 5 stars from me.",1404518400,3,407,4.368421052631579
