8598408,4,B00DVPN27E,"Top drawer filming of a classic French farce directed by a former member of the Comedie Francais (Jacques Charon).A most unusual film choice for Fox but it was made,I believe,at the time when revenues earned abroad by the film studios were frequently NOT brought back to the United States(for tax reasons) but were used to make other films abroad. While not for everyone,it is a treat to see such a well-acted and well-produced example of the genre come from a major film studio. Don't expect subtlety - French farce is anything but!!

8598410,1,B00DVPN27E,"A FLEA IN HER EAR is a charming, clever film just added on DVD to the 20th Century Fox ""Cinema Archives"" series.  Shamefully, the company that pioneered wide screen presentation has chosen pan-and-scan as its sole DVD format for this new release.  It's as if wide screen showings on flat screen tv sets had not long since become public standard.  Granted, compromises were necessary to release films shot in CinemaScope and Panavision to last-century, tube televisions.  But, that was then.  Anamorphic  elements do exist on this 1968 feature.  What a pity that the film's knockout art direction and multiple-characters-in-motion photographic compositions have been so short-changed.  As have we.

The sound's also poor and the condition of the ""bonus"" trailer is beyond lousy.",1392940800,3,777,5.30327868852459
8598411,4,B00DVPN27E,"I got a little tired of the farce, though clever, but I never tired of the gorgeous sets, costumes, hair styles and cinematography.  What a visual treat!  And of course, I also love Rex Harrison in movies.",1391644800,2,205,4.513513513513513
8598412,5,B00DVPN27E,This movie is hilarious. I love love love this movie. It's got all the fast talking hi-jinx you would expect from a film from this era. Rex Harrison is the best part. lol,1384473600,6,170,4.181818181818182
8598413,4,B00DVPN27E,"The predominant setting is a turn-of-the-century seedy Parisian hotel where couples go for illicit trysts.  There's a lot of door slamming, bed hopping, misunderstandings, jealous spouses, and mistaken identity.  To boot Rex Harrison plays an upright barrister and a drunken bellhop.  You kind of know where this one is going.  That said the film's lack of pretense is its charm and the cast seem to be having a good old time.  Nothing special here but a nice clean bawdy romp.",1382832000,,477,4.9125
8598414,5,B00DVPN27E,this must have been hilarious on the stage; rex harrison as two such disparate characters was a joy. if you like a farce this is for you. the settings and costumes were great!,1377216000,6,175,4.333333333333333
