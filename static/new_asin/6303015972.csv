She was such a huuuuuge Menudo fan, and loved Robi Rosa. I myself have just been introduced to Draco Rosa's insanely extensive music catalog myself so it's been fun to take this little walk down memory lane.

Yes, the acting was brutal and the plot was predictable.  If you're looking to learn some good Salsa dance moves, this movie is not for you because the dancing wasn't very good.  That being said, I still love this movie.  It was a cheesy love story with amazing music.  For me, there's something awesome about this movie.  Maybe it's Rosa and Harvey (who was real awful)?  I knew this movie wasn't going to be a huge hit so I didn't expect a big deal.  I recommend this movie if you like cheesy love stories cuz that's all it really is.",1279238400,,670,4.21259842519685

The salsa dancing makes West Side Story look like Breakin 2. The minor plot lines with the best friend going out with the sister has Godfather 2 written all over it. Hell, the steamy scenes with robby and his chicks have people in the Adult industry jealous. This movie had a nation on their feet dancing to the funky sounds of Celia Cruz and Tito Puente but the movie will be remembered for the rest of our lives.

The movie as such is similar to many 80's dance movies but being a Salsa dancer I enjoyed this one so much more.

If you are a fan of Salsa then this movie is for you good story line it's about a young Puerto Rican and his dream to go to Puerto Rico and win the Salsa Competion. The music will get to you it's that good you will want to get up and dance. It's an old movie but it is still good. Robby Rosa star's in this movie you will remember him from the Group Menudo, Rodney Harvey from The Outsiders another old movie so if you love music and like to dance get it.",1203984000,3,621,3.859375

Thanks for Amazon, i can trace back my 20-year-ago great memories, when i could not find the soundtrack and DVD any more in Taiwan. The songs in this movie such as Margarita and Puerto Rico are my favorites. While listening to them, i feel as if i were in an exciting and romantic carnival.
A romantic story in this movie also attracts and suits youngsters and teenagers.

535664,5,6303015972,"I love this movie.  I first watched it when it was released on video VHS 1988. I was 12.  I have watched it many times since.  I bought the soundtrack in the early 1990's and then bought the VHS some years later.  I only purchased a proper copy of this on DVD via Amazons.  I recently discovered Amazons early this year and have bought of alot of imported DVD's and CD's.  Knowing that you can now get some of your favourite movies now on DVD, factory sealed.  I have alot of VHS movies now being shelved.  I am building up my DVD collection by replacing my VHS versions.

The best part I love about the film is of course, the DANCING AND THE MUSIC.  My favourite songs are Salsa Heat by Michael Sembello, Puerto Rico by Michael Sembello, Good Lovin (love this song!!), Chicos V Chicas and Margarita.

The acting is very average, because that is not what you are really watching it for.  I also loved Rodney Harvey, he was good-looking at that time.

535667,1,6303015972,"This is by far the worst dance movie I have ever watched. The characters, acting and plot lines are laughable (even for someone who usually loves cheesy dance movies) and what little dancing there is in the film is badly filmed and boring.  If it hadn't been for the hilarious 80's outfits and hairdos (especially the curly mullet sported by the lead character), I would have turned it off. If you like salsa, watch 'Dance With Me'.",1164240000,,432,4.6103896103896105

535750,5,6303015972,"I first watched this movie when I was 7 years old, with my Mom, here in Croatia. Never have I imagined I would be able to buy it and watch it so many years after, especially since I have been dancing my whole life and salsa for the last 2 years. The words cannot express how I felt watching this movie and reliving the passion I feel every time I step on the dance floor. Yes, it's an 80's movie and yes, the acting could have been better. But that was how the music and salsa were interpreted back then I if it was any different, it would be disappointing. The lovestory is nicely incorporated in the movie, which is full of strong, bold salsa moves. Robby Rosa is absolutely fantastic and was the best choice for this role. The appearance of Celia Cruz, the Queen of Salsa, and Tito Puente shows that the makers of the movie wanted to show salsa in all its variety - from classical (Celia Cruz) to hip and modern (Chicos Y Chicas) because salsa can be danced to any music. It comes from the heart, and this movie shows it in the best possible way.",1160870400,2,1049,4.223880597014926
535751,1,6303015972,"So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing.

Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!!

I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!!  I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa!

It was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That's IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That's it.

If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.

If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie...

There was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....

Oh, and the story line?  What was it again????

Yeah...

I love movies, good ones and bad ones.

But this one???  The WORST movie I have seen so far...

To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing.

Rico (Robby Rosa and Menudo) wants to win a dance competition that will take him to Puerto Rico.  He's also the older and over protective brother to Rita and when she starts dating his best friend Ken, he goes nuts when he finds out (they keep their relationship secret for a while).  Will this ruin his chance of winning the dance comp?

As I said earlier, there is fantastic music in this movie.  Margarita and Under My Skin are the best.  The actual scene when they play Margarita is fantastic.

But I don't see masturbating against a car engine as dancing. The ""dancing"" in this movie is all sexually suggestive/explicit. The director, producers, and choreographers came up with the idea to put hormone crazed teens and 20-somethings in a movie where they gyrate, rub their bodies against another's, then label it dancing.  The protagonist was full of ego and machismo. If I'm not mistaken, Rico (the lead character) had sex with an underaged friend of his sister's. Then ""dissed"" her in the next scene. In reality, I think he'd be accused today of statuatory rape. I did not like the message this movie was sending to young people.",1105574400,19,778,4.63768115942029

Fortunately we don't have to wait long between drama interludes to get to all the fun and what this movie is all about! Don't buy this movie for the acting; buy it for the dancing!

Of course, this movie was made in the 80's so you'll see all the trappings of this decade woven through the movie. One could watch this movie as an 80's study. This isn't a detractor, however, from this great dance flick. You'll see bits of 80's specific dancing, 80's style salsa, salsa that transcends decades, ""New York"" style Salsa, ""street"" salsa, solo dance numbers, group ""line"" salsa, and multiple partner switching. Lots of the dancing is timeless and stuff you can incorporate today!

One of the features of this movie is the music performances done by multiple artists of the period. The most notable of them being one each from the amazing, late Celia Cruz and the amazing, late Tito Puente. Their music performances are the backdrop for much of the dancing.

As with all forms of dance, there is snobbery as to how to dance ""real"" salsa. This is even addressed at one point in the movie when Rico, with his more ""street"" style and the club owner La Luna, with her more polished ""New York"" style tell each other that they're not sure if what the other is dancing is ""real"" salsa. Ha ha! The snobbery in dance is ever living!

You will recognise the club owner in the movie as the same actress in the movie Dirty Dancing who tried to steal Patrick Swayzee's character from Jennifer Gray's. She is reprising a similar role here. Once again, though, don't get this movie for the acting/plot/drama; buy it for the dancing!

[Note One] the acting here isn't terrible and is certainly bearable, it's just not as high quality as that in Dirty Dancing which has a better plot and acting but is not as good in the dance scenes.

[Note Two] this movie has minimal Spanish; it is 95% in English. Most of the Spanish words are the basic ones we all learned from Sesame Street when we were kids.",1089676800,81,2198,4.4825

535951,1,6303015972,"Typical boring plot, salsa wannabees. Horrible acting and the unremarkable dance scenes are dragged out. The closeups of Rico and his intense stares are trite. As for the dancing itself, lets just say I've seen more sophiticated and inventive salsa moves in Idaho. When you have to keep fast forwarding to find an interesting moment you know the movie is bad.

At a yearly Christmas Dance party for kids, I wanted something different for the Teenagers and that's how I grabbed to pick Salsa Dance Picks audio from Crosswords store in town. The music became a great hit on the floor inspite of majority of teenagers hadn't heard it before. That made me pick up the movie too and like Lambada, Dance with me and other great hits, Salsa is watching Fun, feels great n exciting with the swinging sways and energetic.

535954,5,6303015972,"I've watched this for a number of times now but never got tired of watching it. Robbie Rosa has so much energy in this film that just watching him move makes you wanna dance too.
 When this film was released, I used to think it's  just another teenage sex movie. Came to find out, it's not--it's sensual but not dirty.
 Watch this and you'll remember the ""Menudo Days.""",1058400000,3,369,4.397058823529412
535955,4,6303015972,"Salsa is pure entertainment from start to finish. It is the embodiment of fun but cheesy 80's films. It tries to be serious, but fails for the most part because everything about it is so dated. Yet, it is energetic and lively, with upbeat songs and very HOT dancing.  You'll ultimately find yourself addicted, without knowing why. it is definitely the better of the 'dirty dancing' films that came out in the late 80's and early 90's. While 'Dirty Dancing' was 'better' in terms of story, acting, and sets, Salsa is the more entertaining of the two, with its fabulous songs and delicious dancing. This is a must-see for fans of 'Lambada' and 'The Forbidden Dance'. And at ..., hey, it's a DVD that can definitely be afforded.",1055289600,,725,4.6640625

535957,1,6303015972,"When I ordered this video I didn't care too much if the acting or storyline was good(which they are not), I only wanted to see good salsa dancing.  Salsa instruction videos cost around $30, this video was $10, some reviewers said there was some good salsa moves, so I figured I could save money and just learn the moves on the tape... boy I was wrong, the salsa dancing on this tape is not interesting, I don't even think they're dancing salsa, it's like some alternative.  They just named the movie Salsa in order to sell it.  This video might appeal to you if you're a Robby Rosa fan, who is kind of cool, yet still cheesy.  Anyone looking for good dancing, this video is not for you.",1043452800,4,686,4.3359375
535958,1,6303015972,"Being a big fan of dance movies including Dirty Dancing and Center Stage, I read the customer reviews about Salsa and decided to give it a go. I wasn't expecting a good story line or even good acting, however, I was expecting good choreograpny! Unfortunately I didn't get the latter, I found the dance pieces completelty boring, with no complex or inspiring movement, frankly the only thing that kept me entertained was Robby Rosa's hair style! I find it very difficult to believe that the man who choreographed Salsa also choreograped Dirty Dancing for there is definitely no comparison!",1042675200,4,588,4.94949494949495
535959,4,6303015972,Personally I think this is the best movie ever made for dancing too. I remember the first time I saw this when I was 7 and me and my sister would try to learn the dance moves. I remember that I watched it so much that one day the tape busted. I was so mad at myself for a long time knowing that they would never play it on tv again. 10 years passed and there was this new thing of searching for videos online and thanks to the internet I was lucky to find a copy of this once in a lifetime movie. The movie is great and the actors are HOT!! Even thought the cutest one Kenny (Rodney Harvey) is dead now its still nice to see how gorgeous he was in the movie. I recommend that whoever wants to go back and listen to some hot music to watch SALSA a so called Dirty Dancing for Hispanics or Latinos!!!,1025568000,11,798,3.932098765432099
