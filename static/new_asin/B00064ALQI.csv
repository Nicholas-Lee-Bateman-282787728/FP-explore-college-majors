8038328,5,B00064ALQI,"This DVD shows highlights of Smetana's ""The Moldau"" (which is a river by the way) and ""The Bartered Bride"" and Edvard Grieg's ""Peer Gynt Suite,"" all filmed in 1985.  Each piece begins in a lavish concert hall with full orchestra.  Smetana's work is played by the Czech Philharmonic.

The Moldau begins with the orchestra and cuts to a film of the Moldau flowing through a beautiful countryside and eventually growing into a huge raging river bordering a large city.  The film diverts in a few spots to show you some of the sights.  Of course, the tempo of the music perfectly matches the flow of the river.

The Bartered Bride starts with an illustrated synopsis of the opera, pieced together from scenes you are about to see, then the orchestra begins to play and the film rolls along.  It's not Jerusalem and Popp, but there is very good dramatization and dancing.  It includes all the important musical highlights.

Finally, there is the Peer Gynt Suite by Edvard Grieg.  It begins with an illustrated synopsis of the forthcoming ballet.  This time the Slovene Philharmonic plays and the Ballet of the Slovenic National Theatre performs.  All the principal numbers are included and it's very well done.

I'm sure I'll watch this again and again.",1234396800,4,1248,4.830188679245283
