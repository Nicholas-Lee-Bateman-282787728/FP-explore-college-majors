8601232,4,B00176SHBK,"HERCULES AGAINST THE SONS OF THE SUN stars Mark Forest (KINDAR THE INVULNERABLE, HERCULES AGAINST THE MONGOLS) as everyone's favorite slab of massiveness! While the ancient Incas are busy w/ their latest human sacrifice, they are unaware that Hercules has just washed ashore. Before long, Herc is discovered and taken back to the Inca village. Immediately, he finds himself in the middle of a political power struggle, between the prince and usurpers of the Inca throne. Soon enough, big-H gets a chance to move a huge boulder, in order to save a woman.  Alas, she perishes, leaving her young son to go w/ Hercules and his new friends. Of course, there are a multitude of people whom he must set free from cruel oppression, along w/ the expected test of strength. Apparently, the Inca women wore the long dresses, while the men wore the micro mini-skirts. Hercules goes on a quest to rescue the prince's sister, Hamara (Anna-Maria Pace) from being sacrificed. He moves another boulder, this time wearing a very fashionable, fringed tablecloth cape. and feathers on his noggin. He breaks up the sacrifice party, literally! By moving more gigantic stones! Now, the princess is in love w/ him. Meanwhile the fake king, Ata Hualpa, spreads terror, looking for those who would dethrone him. Can Hercules help restore the rightful ruler? By the gods, yes! Let the tribal dance begin! My goodness, how does that woman move like that, w/ 200 lbs. of gold on her head?! Enter the Inca ceremonial dance troupe! Next stop, Broadway! Huzzah!! Now, onto the great battle, complete w/ Inca-made war-machines! Hercules leads the rebels against Ata Hualpa and his men, led by a man in a Teddy bear hat. Here! We! Go! Arrows fly, as Hercules throws men around like balls of lint! Can he and the prince defeat Ata Hualpa, in his odd girdle-bra? Extra points for the high priest, whose outfit contains more feathers than a flock of ostriches! Watch immediately!...",1502582400,,1945,4.893939393939394
8601233,1,B00176SHBK,"You would need the combined strength of Hercules, Thor, and a grizzly bear just to watch this movie from start to finish.  every man wears a miniskirt and is incapable of running.  instead of running they prance and skip.  to reiterate, greased muscular men wearing miniskirts prance  and skip around.  several of the ""heavy boulders"" Hercules has to move/throw always bounce on the floor.  This would suggest that the rocks are made from foam but what do I know.",1479081600,,463,4.7974683544303796
