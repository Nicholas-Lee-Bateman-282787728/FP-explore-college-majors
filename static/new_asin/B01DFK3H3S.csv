8755859,5,B01DFK3H3S,"I was unfamiliar with almost everyone featured here, and somewhat wary about spending money on a music dvd of ""unknowns."" Happily, my wife thought, in this instance, we should see about broadening our horizons. I am joyously humbled. David Holt's tour of the music of Appalachia captures social history, the evolution and blending of musical forms and traditions, the relationships between instruments, and--most important--the breath and depth of the music.

I am often struck by how much more difficult it is to write a positive review than a negative one, and how positive reviews (perhaps like this one) can easily become pedantic and boring. So, my suggestion is that you watch and listen and , hopefully, enjoy the music as much as I did.",1464480000,2,744,5.0
