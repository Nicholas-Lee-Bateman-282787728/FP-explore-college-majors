8264934,3,B00175W9HY,"Got a glimpse of this nice Australian-made action adventure today and liked it very much. It is typical of the actioners made during this period and that's not bad. Done in color it has South African authentic backdrops and very good underwater sequences. Dale Robertson, popular American TV star of the time, and veteran British actor Richard Todd head an able cast for a delightful diversion for the old fashion type escape drama.",1244678400,,432,4.931506849315069
