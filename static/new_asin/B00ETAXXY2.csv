5943352,5,B00ETAXXY2,One of my favorite movies - a narrative/documentary that tells the story of a notorious Mexican drug lord in narrative form with interviews of the actual person cleverly interspersed throughout. A well-told and powerfully compelling story. A must-see.,1469664000,2,251,5.631578947368421

5943355,4,B00ETAXXY2,"Saw this impactful film tonight.  Combines gritty, realistic view of life in Tijuana with the redeeming power of God.  Well worth an hour and a half combined with reading sub-titles.",1407888000,5,182,5.033333333333333
5943356,5,B00ETAXXY2,"This is just an incredible true story.  I know a little regarding drug problems in Mexico and realistically, it is unsolvable because the drug controls both the economy and government here.  For the first time, I see hope in the issue facing the country.",1481932800,,254,4.75

5943364,5,B00ETAXXY2,"Just last night I recommended this movie to a group of friends at a party. Not the first time I've recommended it. In today's seemingly hopeless world situations, this movie encourages me that nothing is impossible when God steps into the picture. The most awesome thing is that the story is true!",1473033600,,297,4.730769230769231
5943365,5,B00ETAXXY2,"As a person of faith and a filmmaker with 40 years of experience in Hollywood, I was deeply moved by this film.  I'm usually not a fan of ""faith-based movies"" as too many of them are preachy and can actually turn off people who are searching for God.  But Los Traficantes is a beautifully written, acted and directed film.  It's a true story, so there is no preaching necessary.  The story unfolds with great suspense, interesting twists and turns, and they all really happened.  An agnositc would have to think at least twice after seeing this movie.",1472428800,4,551,4.639175257731959
8609323,5,B00ETAXXY2,Great movie!!! Great example of what Jesus Christ will do if we believe!!!,1529539200,,74,4.769230769230769
8609324,5,B00ETAXXY2,"Wow, what a wonderful story that happens to be real. All things are possible once
one puts their faith in God's hands. One must surrender to the Lord's will. As
everything happens because of the Lord's will; nothing happens without his will.
Surrender only takes an instance! God bless and surrender.

Loved the way the story was told, cast, acting and directing.",1524528000,,363,4.854838709677419
8609325,1,B00ETAXXY2,"This didn't seem too exciting, It may have been a drama or a church movie, i never got to the end so i don't know, but if you like stuff like that you may like this. I watched quite a bit of this, like over half maybe three quarters of it and I just lost interest, this was very boring,",1520208000,,286,3.783333333333333

8609328,5,B00ETAXXY2,Amazing story! Even more amazing is that it's true... The prison scenes reminded me of Mel Gibson's Get The Gringo. Had no idea things were run that way. Opened my eyes to how kids get involved in the drug trade in the first place. Really humanized them rather than the archetypes we're used to seeing in films. The best part is that his redemption is still effecting people to this day. Lots of posting on how this film effects the people of this region. This movie is undeniably compelling.,1494979200,,492,4.53932584269663
8609329,1,B00ETAXXY2,"15 minutes into this film/doc(?) I couldn't stop laughing. SERIOUSLY bad actors for the portrayals.  I'd rather just see the interviews of the actual people than the acted scenes.  Seriously, I'm really tired of actors portrayed as Mexican with a Puerto Rican or Cuban accent? Cmon! ugh... don't waste your time.",1491436800,,312,5.098039215686274
8609330,5,B00ETAXXY2,"Having grown up on the US/MEXICO border, in both El Paso, TX and San Diego, CA, this movie is SO authentic and relevant to the MEXICAN SOCIETY'S PREDICAMENT. Many are held hostage to the vicious Drug Cartels and poverty.  This wonderful testimony of a man who pulls himself out of the entanglement of the DRUG CARTEL is riveting!!. VERY REALISTIC SITUATION FOR MANY IN MEXICO TODAY!! I don't like preachy movies either but this is a GREAT MOVIE based on an IMPRESSIVE MAN'S COMING TO TERMS in Mexico.... WOW!!@! ~ Tears ~",1490400000,,521,4.663043478260869
