3982345,5,B002SVFM2K,"I have been reading through the book Smart Moves. The research is amazing on the importance of movement, especially right brain/left brain movement. I am actually using this DVD for my personal exercise video. I'm 58. The pace is steady, fun, and cardio for me. I was able to do this video a number of times with my almost 4 year old grandson over the holidays. Highly recommend. I would like to know of others that are along this line. I also use a You Tube clip of ""Brain Gym"" movements with my students at school.",1388880000,6,516,4.385416666666667

3982347,5,B002SVFM2K,"I ordered this DVD because I have recently been introduced to Brain Gym and wanted to see it in action, so to speak. It is a great cardio workout and I love the way the Brain Gym moves are incorporated into it. I like that the video is made with kids doing the workout. I thought I might feel silly working out to a kids video, but it's too much fun to feel silly. I would, and have already, recommended this to a friend to use with her 7 and 4 year old. My daughter is only 5 months old, but I am looking forward to making this workout a part of our daily routine when she is old enough. For now she will just have to watch mommy bounce around the living room.",1308096000,11,661,3.9402985074626864

Tried it today and it was fun AND challenging, My grandchild likes to watch me clumsily try to replicate the moves and attempts her own modified version :)",1473811200,,300,4.574074074074074
