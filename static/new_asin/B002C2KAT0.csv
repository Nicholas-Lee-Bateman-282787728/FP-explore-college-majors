8362860,5,B002C2KAT0,I have never had one of these dvds before but I truly enjoyed seeing a series of episodes from a variety of crime shows.  From Dexter to Streets of San Francisco to Hawaii Five-0 to a gritty episode of CSI: New York.  I think anyone will find these dvds of interest.,1253318400,4,266,4.196078431372549
