8125437,1,B000FPX1QA,"This anime sucks, it goes nowhere from the beginning to the end of it. Nothing about it makes sense, it has a thin plot, the female characters are a bit too thin in the stomach and waist area and all of the characters are bland, uninteresting and forgettable.

All this anime is about is taking stories from people, which is very stupid and improbable. How does this even sound interesting or cool? This anime's plot shows it's negative message that it spreads to it's viewers, it's message is: 'plagiarizing is good to do, and so is taking someone else's ideas or stories and making it your own.' This message is horrible (just like this anime), if I did exactly what this message says, I would fail everyone one of my high school classes that involving writing an essay or research paper. This message will never become helpful to people. Anyway, if u ever come across this anime; please avoid seeing it at all costs. You'll thank me later. I give this anime a 1.5/10",1250208000,,969,4.568965517241379
