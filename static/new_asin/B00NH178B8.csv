8678115,4,B00NH178B8,An interesting look at both sides of the rock & roll stardom coin. A rags-to riches - to rags story that is a cautionary tale for all of us,1466035200,,139,3.8275862068965516
8678116,1,B00NH178B8,I can't figure out why this was even released. The story itself is fairly boring and the ending is not really an ending at all.  Total waste of time.,1465603200,,149,4.137931034482759
8678117,2,B00NH178B8,The whole thing didn't feel genuine. But I truly wish Mr. Fortune the best.,1465257600,,75,4.428571428571429
8678118,5,B00NH178B8,"Interesting doc.  Some might call it a PR piece -- ok.

I'm one of these weirdos that has never seen a reality TV show.  ANY of them in the last 16 years.  But Ill chime in, anyway, on all what I saw in this doc:

My take on Fortune is that he's got the right voice and image.  Think he was in a bit of an ""arranged-marriage"" back in 2006-2011 with INXS and it was a bad fit.  Because I seriously doubt INXS wanted to publicly-audition a new lead -- some jack@ss reality-producer probably put them up to it.

Doc takes you on a few shows and thats basically the club scene here in Hollywood.  Most acts don't get picked up.  But most acts have cra*p leads.

After watching this doc, I'd like to believe that Fortune been living shabby for awhile, industry has kicked him to the curb, but now is an opportunity for good management to capitalize on the guy's talent, produce an outstanding stage act, and some first rate music.  Fortunes got to be his own pilot on his drug use  if he cant control that, hes doomed -- success or no.  Id personally recommend XR amph. use and pass on the coke.

For starters, Fortune needs to hand pick his people. He can't afford to be boho and ""nice."" Professional musicians are common.  Good leads and song-writers are a different story.  And the best ones are ALWAYS jerks, ALWAYS a-holes.  Ironically, the criticism of Fortune is actually a celebration of his aptitude as a lead singer.

Get Fortune a song-writer and direct the stage act until its 110% and then run it.  And cap on that name, also. The guys music should also be used for advertising and commercials  edgy new products from young companies that don't have any hang-ups about drug BS.  Investors:  Who does this song? Answer: JD Fortune.  Investors:  Good choice.  Even his name sounds Cha-Ching.

Excellent doc.  Shows a good opportunity for smart managers.",1465084800,,1859,4.518072289156627
8678119,1,B00NH178B8,"I think the positive reviews were written by his family.  This ""documentary"" i.e. badly done PR piece, is boring and a waste of time.  Just the fact that this guy was picked via tv competition put on by the living members of INXS is depressing.",1464998400,,244,4.4
8678120,3,B00NH178B8,"Unfortunately this is a documentary with the clear approval of J.D. Fortune who is a wildly arrogant and erratic person posing as a very humble and grounded one. I wanted and expected to see more of his time in INXS and why his on again / off again relationship ultimately didn't work out. There is little to none of that. I have read repeated accounts of how they couldn't deal with his excessive cocaine use and dependence and his arrogant attitude. The band declined to comment for the documentary. J.D. is a talented singer (but mediocre song writer) that lacks authenticity on-stage. What you see is a guy doing his best to play the roll of a ""rock star"" while fronting bands. That includes his cheesy stage name as ""J.D. Fortune"" is not his real name. This doc tries hard to get you to feel sorry for his plight (kicked out of INXS unceremoniously and not penniless as he tries to rebuild his career) while the truth is probably closer to the notion that he was an arrogant little s*** who snorted much of his earnings up his nose while burning bridges.",1462406400,3,1059,4.520833333333333
8678121,5,B00NH178B8,This is a really good documentary and worth your time.  Excellent in all aspects.,1458604800,,81,4.785714285714286
8678122,2,B00NH178B8,The guy is a douche bag. His music sucks!!!,1456704000,,43,3.888888888888889
