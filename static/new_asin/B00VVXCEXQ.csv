8711413,2,B00VVXCEXQ,"This production of Jackson Hole and Yellowstone is less than 30 minutes in length.  It is not possible to come close to doing justice to these two magnificent areas in such a short period of time.  With his comments and packaging, Mr. Linsdau  suggests that his offering is a comprehensive production.  It is far from comprehensive.  I have hiked every maintained trail in Grand Teton and many in Yellowstone and have all or nearly all of the professional productions concerning Grand Teton and Yellowstone.  Mr. Linsdau's offering is rather disappointing, I am sorry to say.  TallaBob",1484438400,,585,5.03125
8711414,5,B00VVXCEXQ,"I've lived in Jackson for a long time and I saw things in this video I've never seen elsewhere. The most striking was the deer fawn bounding down the trail near Hidden Falls off Jenny Lake. I have yet to see a deer fawn - it was so cute! There are all the other elk, bison (buffalo), pronghorn, moose, and the like, but the deer fawn made the film for me.
If you've never been to Jackson Hole, Grand Teton, or Yellowstone, this movie will make you want to go!",1456099200,,459,4.111111111111111
