2534527,4,B000EU1ONS,"This is the kind of movie I used to enjoy seeing a couple of times a year and now see, oh, about once every 10 years or so.  An incredibly interesting, odd, provocative movie, that doesn't insult its audience.  The acting is phenomenal, the script is really interesting, and the characters are not people you've seen 1000 times before.  Although it's sort of about baseball, it's not a baseball movie.  It's a pity that so few people want to see interesting movies like this.  I loved this movie.",1149206400,20,496,4.590909090909091
2534528,4,B000EU1ONS,"Game 6 is a charming and funny movie with Keaton playing a playwright who's afraid of failure. In a tough time in his life, his wife wants a divorce, he thinks a tough critic is destined to hate his play and his cursed team the Red Sox could finally win the World Series. A good reason why his play might fail though is because his lead actor has a parisite in his brain and he can't remember his lines.  Keaton is perfect here and for once Ebert & Roeper were right. Although I didn't love the movie as much as them, I do agree about Keaton. People are way too hard on this guy and call him a bad actor. Meanwhile there's also tons of people out there that think he was the best Batman ever.

  What I find funny though is that they don't say HOW or WHAT makes him a bad actor. Because you can't, they're just hating on the guy for no reason. Who else could've actually pulled off the part of BeetleJuice without it ruining their career ? Keaton did and he was perfect in that too. Roeper  says that Keaton should get nominated for this but that just won't happen. The reason why is that sadly people saw him more in his bad movies like Herbie Fully Loaded, Jack Frost, White Noise and the Presidents Daughter than they saw him in this. Those got big releases all over the world when this film is on dvd alreday. It's pretty sad since this is a good Michael Keaton movie. When he gets offered a movie with a big hollywood release, the script is bad and not worthy of his skill.

  The film also has great supporting work, especially from people like Robert Downey jr. He Plays the critic that Keaton thinks is going to totally bash his play. Downey jr. gives a strange but fun Christoper Walken type permformance here. When him and Keaton finally have a scene together it's just excellent with fine acting between the two. This probably isn't a film everyone will appreciate but they should at least give it a try.",1149033600,11,1915,4.314763231197771
2534529,4,B000EU1ONS,"I loved this movie. Ebert & Roper are right. The cast is solid..every performance. Being a sports fan, I die with Keaton in the bar. This movie is so much better than most of the junk out there. A great ""sit""",1142294400,3,208,4.097560975609756
2534530,5,B000EU1ONS,"I recently attended the premiere in New York City of Game 6 and was frankly surpised and amazed by what I saw. To me, Micheal Keaton is Batman, Bebe Neuwirth was Lilith, Robert Downey Jr., is well, Robert Downey Jr. What I watched was an amazing story from the master story teller, Don DeLillo, that was full of character, sub plots and great dialog. Keaton, as Ebert and Rober said, gave the first Oscar worthy performance of 2006. His character is torn between his passion for his play that tells the story of his family which opens that evening and watching his beloved Red Soxs in the sixth game of the World Series.

This is not a baseball film, nor is it a theater film. This is a film about people. For anyone that wants to see strong performances deliver great lines under wonderful direction from Michael Hoffman, I highly recommend this film.",1142294400,14,852,4.568627450980392
2534531,5,B000EU1ONS,"As a Mets fan and a physicist, this movie strikes a special resonance with me.  This is not primarily a baseball film, but a baseball theme forms an important sub-plot. The Michael Keaton character is a playwright and  obsessive Red Sox fan. (Aren't they all!) My nephew, who works for the Red Sox radio station in Boston, was foolish enough to leave the following question on his answering machine: ""What was the greatest moment in sports history?""  I had no hesitation in informing him that it was the event of the tenth inning of the 1986 World Series that no Red Sox fan can ever forget. My nephew soon changed his away message.

Since my training is in quantum mechanics, I am partial to the Many Worlds formulation, which says that every time an event has multiple possible outcomes, each outcome occurs in its own parallel universe. I believe that we have evidence that we do live in a very improbable parallel world. We can trace the branching of our world from the more probable universe to the bottom of the tenth in 1986 when Mookie Wilson's ground ball eluded Bill Buckner's glove.

I did not see this movie when it first came out.  However, when I did get to see it recently, the physicist in me could not help but to admire the insertion of the Many Worlds of quantum mechanics into the story. The Mets fan could not help laughing. If you are a physicist/Mets fan, this is your movie.",1324598400,,1398,4.527777777777778
2534532,4,B000EU1ONS,"An all-dialogue movie. Baseball. Theater. Downey Jr in make-up with a black-eye, meditating, carrying a gun. Keaton going about his day, also armed, speaking in snappy one-liners. Don DeLillo has written a very witty, slow-burning film with great performances and little action. The dialogue sounds very, very, very much like a play. It should have been a play. This doesn't detract from it, I guess, though it won't appeal to many people, especially those expecting a movie movie, if that makes sense. Yes-sir-re-bob.",1294963200,,518,5.253012048192771
2534533,5,B000EU1ONS,"Don DeLillo wrote this movie.  I could end the review right there for he is one of our very best American writers of the last few decades.  I remember when I first read his novel WHITE NOISE, thinking ""I haven't read anything this good in years.""  But we got even more fortunate because Michael Keaton, who most viewers dismiss as only a comic, is a great character actor and he delivers the goods here.  In a nutshell his play opens on Broadway one night but he isn't there as his beloved Boston Red Sox are in the World Series and in his world, nothing trumps that.  Keaton's interpretation of this loves to be miserable playwright is nothing short of brilliant.  He captures every nuance.  Robert Downey Jr. does a wonderful turn as a theater critic.  SEE THIS!

2534534,5,B000EU1ONS,"I really got into this little (and with a budget of a half maillion I mean little) movie..and was locked in for the very brief 80+ minute ride. The acting is excellent...and I really felt every character. It has nothing in common with the big budget CGI films dominating the DVD racks but more in common with something  like ""Doubt"" ..a small group of characters who the viewer becomes emotionally attached to very quickly and enter their world. The story may be a bit more  effective on people like myself who are sports fans and a bit lost on those who aren't but they can perhaps enjoy the theatre angle a bit more than I did.  The movie features some very big name  stars in small roles  and it certainly doesn't LOOK  cheap....very beautifully lit and photographed....just a little gem of a film I felt lucky to see  and it made me think about it for the whole day after I saw it.  Michael Keaton was just brilliant.",1234310400,2,921,4.440476190476191
2534535,4,B000EU1ONS,"My interest in this movie was not box office popularity or the sports theme - it was about the actors Michael Keaton and Robert Downey Jr.  They did not disappoint - and this movie ended up being one of those hidden movie gems that introduce deeper thought than the sacrificial Game 6 sports drama of the Boston Red Sox.

Keaton and Downey Jr. are at the top of their game, as well as the writer with his intelligent use of metaphor's  to portray parallels between the Red Sox losing legacy  and situations in each of the actors characters lives.

Great acting (classic Michael Keaton / Robert Downey Jr.), and an intelligent and suspenseful, well written plot.

An entertaining and Intelligent movie!",1227657600,,701,4.75206611570248
2534536,3,B000EU1ONS,"The title ""Game 6"" refers to the sixth game of the 1986 World Series. Yes, you remember Boston Red Sox and first baseman Bill Buckner. But the film itself is not about him and his legs; it's about New York playwright Nicky Rogan played by Michael Keaton and a string of the events that happen on the day (also the day of the sixth World Series game) when his latest play opens. Some films are sometimes called ""character study"" and here is a film that perfectly describes its nature. It's less about the story surrounding him than his personal life and struggle.

I said we follow the events that take place on the day of the Game 6, but actually the film frequently takes us back to the past of Nicky by introducing some supporting characters on his way to the theater or somewhere else - his daughter Laurel (Ari Graynor), his wife Lilian (Catherine O'Hara) and so on - and thus we come to know Nicky Rogan as a person. It's the opening night for his new film and he looks very worried, especially when he is told by his old friend and playwright Elliott Litvak (Griffin Dunne) about the hated and vitriolic drama critic Steven Schwimmer (Robert Downey Jr.) whose harsh criticism, he says, virtually ruined his career. But of course, we and Nicky are to meet Elliott later, who turns out someone different.

Director Michael Hoffman (""One Fine Day"" ""The Emperor's Club"") uses a cerebral approach in dealing with the characters' situations. You will notice the metaphors and patterns employed here: some things constantly stop; some things (or people) are not what they seem; and unexpected things happen when they shouldn't happen, just like the baseball game of the film's title. The film's screenplay is written by novelist/playwright Don Dolillo which may explain the slightly wordy nature of the film.

Ultimately this is a film made for actors and dialogues. Acting is all great. Michael Keaton plays the character with depth, something most of his recent films seldom allowed him to show. But for those who want the movie to further the story and move on - and I am one of them - watching ""Game 6"" would be a bit painful experience.",1200096000,,2140,4.6861702127659575
2534537,5,B000EU1ONS,"Service was perfect, thanks.  Item arrived quicker than I expected, and in great condition.",1196467200,,91,5.5
2534538,3,B000EU1ONS,"Although Ebert & Roeper give the film ""Two Thumbs Way Up"" and Roeper seems to think that Keaton turns in ""the first nomination worthy performance of 2006"", Game 6 is slow, and rather boring for the majority of the film. And that's saying a lot when the film is only around 80 minutes long, apparently 87 if you believe the box.

The acting is all solid. Keaton does turn in a solid performance, as does everyone else, most notably Robert Downey Jr. as an infamously negative and destructive theatre critic and Catherine O'Hara as Keaton's soon-to-be-ex-wife. The problem is the production value of the film... and the script. When you only have $500,000 to work with and you're filming in Manhattan, not much can be expected of your production value (though the director and cinematographer did opt for 16mm film instead of going for digital, good call). As for the script...

Don DeLillo's Game 6 has been sitting around Paramount going unmade for almost 15 years now. After seeing the movie, it's clear that there's a reason why. It seems loosely based on the book Cosmopolis, or maybe it's the other way around since Cosmopolis only came out a few years ago. Replace a high-powered executive with a high-profile playwright and you've got almost the same story: a man's world seems to be falling down around him as he rides in various unmoving taxi cabs all day, stopping to see his daughter, his mistress, his wife, and get a haircut. Game 6, however, is set in 1986 on the day of the sixth game of the World Series between the Red Sox and the Mets.

Many of the scenes in Game 6 are almost exactly the same dialogue as Cosmopolis, which is off-putting considering they're different stories and no mention of the novel is made anywhere. The dialogue is distinctly DeLillo with people often repeating a phrase several times, or giving a monologue out of left field as if it actually applies to the situation at hand.

What makes this movie bearable, and actually almost enjoyable, is watching Michael Keaton do his best to navigate the scenery and the script, and knowing that he's doing it out of passion for the story, and not for money, regardless of whether the story itself seems deserving of said pasion.

By the end, the film seems to get a firm grasp of where it's going and how it's getting there, and almost manages to pull the viewer along. It's up to you to decide whether or not you want to go.",1180310400,,2409,4.619158878504673

2534540,4,B000EU1ONS,"Now when I heard the title of Game 6, I thought they were going to have a movie that of a bnasbeall game that took place in 1986, 20 years later, but in this movie it does take place during 1 day in October of 1986, when the Boston Red Sox met the New York Mets, (yes I did say the Mets, and not the Yankees) in game 6 at Shea Stadium. The Main character of the movie Nicky Rogan (Michael Keaton) is a Boston Red Sox fan, and also is a broadway writer/director, and it is also the openning night of his new play. Now this guy takes more rides in Taxis then I have ever seen a character in another movie, and this guy also has problems going in his life. The play is at Music Box Theater, and to have your new play open on the same day, as your team is playing in the World Series. This is the game that the baseball went through Bill Buckner's legs, and the Mets went on to win the World Series, but the good news for Boston Red Sox fans, that within 20 years since the game took place, they got to see thier team win the World Series. Nicky is about to be dirvoced from his wife (Catherine O'Hara), and also a theatre critic named Steven Schwimmer (Robert Downey Jr.) is going to be in attendance at the play, and it going to hate it, and he is warned by best friend, that also had a play that was ripped by him (. And on top of that, his dad (Tom Aldredge) is in poor health, and his daughter (Ari Graynor) is fed up with having to take sides when her parents fight, any child would get tired of doing this, but the good news for her father that she is going to see his play, and even tries to get her to bring a date to the show. The best thing I can say about this movie that it is 83 minutes long, so you can enjoy this mvoie, even if you hate movies that run a long time.",1155427200,4,1777,3.911602209944751

8114358,2,B000EU1ONS,"I don't know how he did it, but Elmore Leonard often succeeded in writing clever dialogue that sounded authentic. Game 6 sometimes succeeds on the clever part, but rarely on the authentic part. For me, it doesnt succeed on the clever part enough to reach base safely. Sometimes, the dialogue doesnt seem clever, but just opaque. Most of the time, it seems stagy. Also, the story seems overwhelmed by random encounters, some of which are too convenient. Overall, I was occasionally amused, but never found any of the characters believable enough to care very much. Why don't the female cabbie and her son sound like real people? Why does Nicky suddenly decide to shoot Steven? Why does Lillian track Nicky down at the bar? Why does Nicky start singing a song about Wally Backman flying to right, when he just watched him fly to left? If Steven doesnt want to be noticed, why does he wear a disguise that guarantees he will be noticed?
