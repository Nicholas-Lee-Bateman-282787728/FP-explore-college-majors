3645260,5,B001HWNYR6,"A couple of weeks ago a I was over at a friend's flat and I was shown No Exit & Play Normally! I loved them so much I purchased some copies for myself and to sell at my knick-knack shop. I don't normally sell DVDs but my customers seem to respect my tastes so I think these will sell.

I've already got a copy of Blondie Live and I can't understand why it's taken so long for No Exit to get released.  It's much better for various reasons. The band, including Debbie Harry, just seems to be playing harder and with more energy. There are many magical moments that just don't happen in Blondie Live (which was shot a few months later in New York). No Exit was shot in Europe in front of really incredible audiences and the audience in New York just doesn't seem to appreciate them quite as much. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen as appreciative an audience as the one in Glasgow during ""Atomic"" (except maybe in the movie Woodstock).

Another reason is the filming. Blondie Live has  a lot of long flowing shots that are crystal clear and rock solid. Which is totally not what I like.  No Exit has a rhythmic shooting and filming style far more appropriate to the music. Cool visual stylizations which are hard to describe but that add power and punch pepper the songs throughout.

The best one is in my favourite song, ""Rapture""; during the three moments she sings the actual word ""rapture"" there's this totally amazing effect that makes her look like the embodiment of an epiphany, rather in keeping with the theme of the song/rap.

Another great moment, from ""Atomic"", is when Jimmy Destri starts playing the theme to ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" by Ennio Morricone right in the middle of the song. Once again there seems to be some kind of heavenly feel to the film's shots here that had to have been done later in ""post"", but I don't really understand what they did. It just looks cool.  And speaking of musical homages, there's a great moment right at the end, during the end of ""Heart of Glass"" (in fact Debbie's already left the stage), when Chris Stein plays a riff taken from one of my favourite (and rather obscure) Jimi Hendrix songs ""Waterfall"". Was ""Heart of Glass"" originally intended to be a kind of antithesis to Hendrix's ballad?

Debbie was still gorgeous back in 1998 and the effect is amplified by the incredible articulation of her performance (which, again, seems to have more energy and more of a ""message"" than in Blondie Live). She doesn't just sing, she acts. She plays the roles of the protagonists of her songs. And I can hear the words of the songs more clearly than I've ever heard them before, both literally and in the way they bounce around in my head while she's singing them.  And her voice! I never knew she could sing with so much power. ""Shayla/Union City Blue"" is a tour de force from both the band (especially Clem Burke) and Debbie who sings with a kind of passion I've never seen, ever!

I've always been a fan of Blondie's music and I've seen all the band's videos too. Apart from my two favourite albums this is the best purchase of their work I've made.",1229126400,5,3108,4.4638447971781305

8309878,5,B001HWNYR6,"We should ensure that modern ""bands"" should watch this DVD for a thorough knowledge of how an excellent band operates.  This is the very best music DVD I've ever seen - and I have every Blondie DVD and VHS that there is to be had!  Superb shots, perfect sound, fantastic recordings.  And the interviews are great - ""I just thought I was crap"" says Debbie.  So honest and forthright.  That's what makes her magical.",1270339200,,414,4.54054054054054
8309879,5,B001HWNYR6,I can't believe that I didn't know that this little gem existed.  Every real Blondie fan needs this in their DVD collection.  Unseen footage from some great concerts and some short one-to-one chats with the band members.  Buy it now!,1265846400,,233,4.775
8309880,5,B001HWNYR6,"This DVD is not a major label, but is a private issue of a Blondie concert after the release of 1999's ""No Exit"". It is a documentay/live concert combination with interviews of the band members inserted between live track performances. If your DVD does not play properly, the manufacturer will quickly replace you DVD with a new DVD, tested in several DVD players to ensure quality.",1265328000,3,382,4.803030303030303
8309881,5,B001HWNYR6,"I first heard Blondie in 1976 and have been a huge fan ever since. That being said I have purchased every CD and DVD I could get my hands on, even the VH1 Classic disc. My number one favorite is  The Old Grey Whistle Test Blondie New Years Eve in Glasgow 1979. My second pick is No Exit. Nothing else is even close. I like the interviews in between the songs and Debbie is so close to the 1979 Blondie it will simply blow you away. If you are a Blondie fan you will have this in your collection. This is the best twenty bucks I have ever spent for a Blondie DVD. Compare that to over $140.00 for the Glasgow disc. We will be enjoying this concert for many years to come.",1254528000,,670,4.037593984962406
