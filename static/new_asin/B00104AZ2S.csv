8236818,5,B00104AZ2S,Awesome classic show from one of the best bands ever. A few of the songs were edited from the original playlist but a great recording nonetheless.,1421798400,,146,4.653846153846154

8236820,2,B00104AZ2S,"I love the illusion albums and I loved watching this show. But they cut out the second half of the show! It included songs like sweet child o mine, don't cry, and estranged! They also cut out some great Axl Rose rants and intros! Over all the music is good but it could have been much better..",1404172800,,293,4.157894736842105
8236821,1,B00104AZ2S,"Be warned this DVD has already been released by a different company and this version is just the same. It's obviously an unofficial release and it shows in the quality. It's just a VHS copied on to a DVD it even has the annoying L+R(left and right meaning stereo) popping up and changing the sound during a lot of the song performances!

The DVD has 13 songs and 2 performance pieces on it and probably the only reason to give it 1* is for a rare live performance of ""Coma"" but even that is ruined by the bad sound and the picture is grainy and bad too.

There is loads of concert footage from Guns N'Roses vast Use Your Illusions tours lying around, it's just a pity we can't get a good official release or even a half decent unofficial one(live Guns N' Roses at the Ritz in 1988) and it's unlikely we will see one anytime soon.",1318377600,8,829,4.2405063291139244
8236822,2,B00104AZ2S,"Filmed in Chicago in '92, of the 15 songs here, a mere 4 of them are from Appetite for Destrectution.  Watching this show, it's like there's two different bands: the stuff from Appetite, and the stuff that came after.  Just listening to this concert really made me realize what they started out as and what they denegrated to.  It's amazing how they can go from rock numbers like Mr Brownstone and Welcome to the Jungle to maudelin crapola like Patience and Civil War.  It's just so weak and corny.  Really, more than half the concert was FILLER.  Even ""Wild Horses"" or ""Attitude"" which they covered while Axl was catching his breath.  He sure runs around a lot.  When this band first got big with ""Appetite"" people thought they were gonna be the next Led Zeppelin.  But after that they just kept getting sappier and sappier as this concert shows.  Elton John rocks harder than these guys.  Really, I was just waiting for them to do ""Candle in the Wind"".",1268179200,11,954,4.585798816568047
8236823,4,B00104AZ2S,This video is pretty good performance wise. The lighting isn't very good but G N'R's performance was as exciting as ever.,1249603200,8,121,4.809523809523809
