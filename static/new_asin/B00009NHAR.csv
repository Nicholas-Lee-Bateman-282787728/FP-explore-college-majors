1885711,5,B00009NHAR,"Aleksandr Sokurov has created a unique, wondrous masterpiece of a film in his great homage of Russian history and art and the Hermitage Museum.  Four years in the planning, a cast of thousands, exquisite reproductions of costumes that span the three hundred years of Russian history, and brilliant cinematography by the German Tilman Buttner, Sokurov has condensed the essence of Russian culture in a 90 minute non-stop 'live' filming within the halls of the Hermitage museum (all 5 palaces known as the winter palaces of the Tsars).  The result is an enchanting, bewitching, meandering tour of Russian from the time of Catherine the Great, Peter the Great, Pushkin, the Romanovs - Nicholas I and II - to the final ball in the palace the night Tsarist Russia ended.  Our tour guide is the off camera voice of Sokurov in conversation with a French Marquis and assorted ghosts of the past as we seamlessly view glimpses of Russia's past, scenes like an actual play that Catherine the Great wrote and watched, the writer Pushkin, the Romanov family at their last supper in the palace and the grand ball that culminates this stage of the glory of Russia.  The ballroom scene is resplendent with vast numbers of costumed actors  dancing a mazurka to the music (Glinka's mazurka from his opera 'The Life of the Tsar') provided by the Maryinski Orchestra conducted by no less than Valery Gergiev! As the guests finally leave the Hermitage museum the camera focuses on an open window overlooking the sea on which the city of St Peterburg floats.  We then know that we have been on an ark of Russian culture for the past 90 minutes - an immeasureably beautiful and sensitive document that has captured all the mystery of Russia's history, presented with tenderness and finesse and with the extraordinary facility using the newest of digital camera technology.  This is a magnificent epic film and deserves a wide audience on its own. The additional information provided by a 30 minute ""How the film was made"" on the DVD is equally informative and graceful.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1063670400,73,2068,4.9054441260744985
1885712,4,B00009NHAR,"""Russian Ark"" has earned a place in cinematic history by being the longest continuous shot ever in a movie. The entire hour-and-a-half film is one uninterrupted take. No edits. No stopping. Tilman Buttner, the film's cinematographer,  supported and maneuvered a digital Steadicam through 33 rooms of St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum for an hour and a half while the action played out before the camera. Director Alexander Sukurov used  2,000 actors, thousands of lavish costumes, precise choreography, and impeccable timing to bring Russian history to life inside the Hermitage Museum, which was for centuries the Winter Palace for Russia's Tzars. The audience sees through the eyes of a modern Russian man, perhaps a ghost, who is able to wander the rooms of Hermitage invisible to those he observes. This man is our narrator, for lack of a better word. His voice is that of director Alexander Sukurov. The narrator encounters another man who is out of place and sometimes unseen by others, a French Marquis who lived in Russia in the early 19th century. The Marquis serves as a guide and provides a running commentary on Russian culture and art, which was not to his liking during his lifetime. As our narrator and the Marquis wander from room to room, they witness the people and history that inhabited the Hermitage through centuries of Romanov rule and into the 20th century. We catch glimpses of Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Nicholas I, Nicholas II and witness the last days of Tzarist government. The Marquis articulates a Western European view of Russian culture as second-rate and borrowed, while our narrator draws attention to works of Russian origin while acknowledging the tendency for Russians to collect foreign art. The film culminates in a magnificent ball with live orchestra, which would have been logistically difficult to film in multiple takes or even to organize in real life, so is especially impressive filmed in one sweeping take. Director Alexander Sukurov has said that ""Russian Ark"" is ""a film about the Hermitage, for the Hermitage."" Although it is interesting to identify and observe the various prominent figures from Russian history that we see, the film isn't a history lesson. It is more like a fly on the wall in the Hermitage Museum, with cultural commentary from both Russian and European, modern and aristocratic, points of view. The background conversations are apparently of so little importance that they are often not translated. I found myself wondering what people were saying though, so some knowledge of Russian might add to the enjoyment of the film. Filming in one long take could be considered an unnecessary gimmick, but the continuous shot does give the feeling of sweeping through the halls of the Museum and its history. ""Russian Ark"" does require patience. Not everything that went on within the walls of the Hermitage was interesting, and our guide was not chosen for having a winning personality. But ""Russian Ark"" has a majesty and originality that impresses despite the film's lack of a conventional narrative. Although it is not at all necessary to the understanding or enjoyment of the film, I found myself curious as to the identity of the Marquis: He is the Marquis de Custine, who, in 1839, published notoriously critical memoirs of his time in Russia.

1885713,5,B00009NHAR,"If you like art (Hermitage style), and you like history, then you have to see ""Russian Ark"". Aside from being a technical masterpiece in that it is the only feature length film ever made in one continuous take (direct to hard drives), it is a stunning visual stroll through the Hermitage across three hundred years of time.
You have never seen anything like it, so don't expect to be able to anticipate, or second guess the action. It's 90 minutes of one continuous take with no cuts or edits. Even if you have been there, you have never seen it like this. Each room was brought back to proper period condition without wires, alarms, or modern additions prior to the shoot. Awesome.
Watch it on the largest, highest resolution screen you can hijack for the evening. It's in Russian, with English subtitles, and it works perfectly. After you see it, run through the extra material on the disk to understand how this incredible film was made. It's even worth another round with the Producers' commentary turned on through the film (he speaks English).
It amazes me to think that this film was able to be produced in such a setting, and I know that it will never happen again. The title of the film describes the Hermitage as the Ark of Russian culture. After you see the film, you will understand.",1063497600,5,1295,4.6103896103896105
1885714,5,B00009NHAR,"Do you like dreamy stylistic movies?  What would happen if a filmaker made a movie using theatre production techniques?  When it works great movie masterpieces have been made.  Citizen Kane, Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, and All About Eve to name a few are wonderful examples.  RUSSIAN ARK is one to add to that list of moviemakers who dared to take the leap.  This movie moves like a ballet that is synchronized with the most beautiful music you have ever heard.
The movie teaches a lesson about the proper perspective of Russian art.  To do this the main character is a ""ghost"" or an old world aristocrat visiting the present-day Hermitage Museum in Russia.  In the begginning the ""ghost"" says the Russia has always ""copied"" other masters of art.  Russian czars have a long history of ""acquiring"" art collections from other European countries.  This wonderful collection still exists in the Hermitage Museum which has been preserved at great cost.  However, not to be overlooked is the Russian contribution in art in the areas of classical music, oil paintings, sculpture, and theatre.  The establishment of the museum and its subsequent preservation all attest to the love of art that Russians have. The movie is made for others that feel the same way.
In the end, like the ""ghost"", we might decide to just stay there forever.  Cheers",1063324800,4,1341,4.833333333333333

1885725,5,B00009NHAR,"Russian Ark isn't for everybody.  Prepare yourself for a thoroughly out-of-mainstream experience.  This is a film that was shot in one take.  Yes.  One take.  The actors had to be strategically placed through the museum so that they would enter their part with the flow of the cameraman who is attached by an umbilical to a batter and to a sound and light man.  The film location is the Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg and the film follows the history of Russia from Peter the Great, through Catherine the Great, and on to Nicholas the II.  Visually entrancing, especially the final ball scene where we see the participants of Russia's upperclass leave the ballroom not knowing the tragedies to follow.  It's almost like watching lambs leading themselves to the destruction of life as they knew it.  The intractability of the upper classes - - not heeding the overwhelming gap between their ostentatious life style to that of the peasant classes - - becomes their undoing, and there's nothing we can do as an audience but helplessly watch them descend the grand staircase into their destruction.  Before launching into the movie, I recommend that the viewer watch the interview with the director and the story of how the film was made.  It will make more sense that way.  Having said that, for anyone not familar with the nuansces of Russian culture, language, and history, the viewer may question their decision to suffer through the 90 plus minutes.  For those students of Russia and those who have experienced life in Russian it will impart the sense of loss and tragedy of a Russia lost to time and memory.  Lastly, the Hermitage is a beautiful testament for Russia's love of art and the director does it justice to be sure.  George Andreev",1494115200,9,1747,4.7959866220735785

1885783,5,B00009NHAR,"I like this film a lot.  It's true that there is hardly any dialogue and no plot, but I enjoy the teasing references to Russian history as we time travel through the Hermitage.  If you don't know any Russian history, this would be a hard way to start.  The nonstop shooting strikes me as more of a stunt than an advance in artistic technique--I don't see why the film could not have been made just as well shot scene by scene in the usual way.  But there is a certain tightrope-without-a-net excitement to live action in which you get precisely one chance.

The scenes and the costumes are quite beautiful.  I thought the air of surreal, dreamy nostalgia was really the point of the film.

1885805,4,B00009NHAR,"This is hard to review.  I think it is a magnificent failure.  Its a failure because it could have done so much more in the way of interesting commentary on the art objects depicted, or the historical significance, or how this museum relates to Russias troubled relationship to the rest of Europe, or how it was politically even acceptable for the director to make the film, or what it has to say about todays tensions between Russia and the Westany one of those things the movie touches on, only enough to leave you wishing there were moreor even wishing for a more coherent plot.  These people, the main conversationalists, they must be ghosts, right?  If so, how is it sometimes real people talk to them and other times, their presence seems to go un-noticed.  Are they actually traveling backward and forward in time, viewing things that took place there?  Or are most of the other people ghosts like them?  I guess it doesnt matter: the film takes place entirely within The Hermitage museum, in what was once St. Petersburg, changed after the revolution to Petrograd, then in Lenins years to Leningrad, and in 1991, perhaps an illustration of Russias yearning for past glory, back again to St. Petersburg.  The museum [The Hermitage] is one of the largest and oldest museums still in operation.  Founded by Catherine the Great in 1764 to house her purchase of some 200 paintings by European masters, it continued to expand and now comprises, depending how you count, between 5 and 10 buildings, some of which were palaces [5 are open to the public]; it has the largest collection of paintings of any museum in the world, and some 3 million total objects, only a small fraction of which are on display at any one time.
The most impressive thing about the film is its technical achievement: the ENTIRE 99 minutes was shot in ONE CONTINUOUS UNINTERRUPTED SHOT.  In the special features there was a claim that no other film had done this.  I know at least one other movie that has, but it was nowhere on the scale of this work.  This film included close to 2,000 people.  And what also convinces me that it is a monumental achievement is that all the costumes were made specifically for the film; what looks like silk really is silk; what looks like gold or silver brocade really is gold or silver brocade; they actually pulled out Catherine the Greats china settings for the table, and so on.  This is an historic collaboration between a Russian filmmaker and a German-speaking cinematographer.  The cinematographer had to have a specially-made jacket and camera, in order to shoot 99 minutes hand-held and uninterrupted.  The whole thing almost didn't work: they were granted only 36 hours of museum closure in order to: set everything up, get everyone costumed and in position, film and get out.  It took 4 years of planning to execute the 99 minutes.  They agreed that if something went wrong in the first 20 minutes, they would restart.  After that, there was not enough time to restartthey had to finish in one single take or scrap the whole film.  Batteries ran out several times and they restarted several times, right up to the 20 minutes at which they could no longer restart.  There is one sequence, watching Catherine the Great as she runs a long distance outside, while it is snowing, from one building to another.  It really WAS winter and snowing, and the cinematographer was very worried that on re-entering the building the lens would immediately frost up, because it had been 20 below zero outside [that must have been Fahrenheit; the cinematographer speaks in English in the special feature].  It didn't frost up.  Toward the end, in the ballroom sequence, the cinematographer further explains by then he was hurting in muscles he hadnt even known existed.  He worried about permanently harming himself and almost stopped filming.  He said to his assistant, I cant go on.  The assistant, thinking it was only a technical concern about navigating among the dancers, was still full of enthusiasm.  Then the stunning scene captivated the filmer and gave him a burst of adrenaline, enough to finish the filming.  It is said when cut was finally called, pretty much everyone collapsed to the floor, exhausted from tension and standing for hours, and many wept with relief that it actually had worked.  They pulled off the impossible!
The main narration is between an unidentified Frenchman and an invisible Russian.  The Frenchman alternates between insulting and complementing his companions culture; the companion never directly challenges him, just asks obliquely if he is sure of what hes asserting.  The Russian speaking is actually the director.  The French character was a real figure in European history, and here a ghost.
The dramatic peak of the movie occurs not far from the end, after witnessing a spectacular ballroom dance with a live symphony orchestra, when the invisible Russian asks the Frenchman if he isn't coming along with him to another room.  The Frenchman simply shakes his head no, several times.  He prefers to remain in that moment of time: a moment in which all of Europe seemed one great, glorious civilization, at peace.  The Russian then speaks: so long, Europe.  Goodbye
The meaning of the title isn't revealed until the last scene: looking outside again from the museum, all the Russian can see is a dark, cold ocean, with wisps of mist rising from it.  The museum is an ark of culture, riding on a sea of chaos.  The director too seems to regret the past, and have a foreboding about the future.  Another curious phrase relating to time: Everyone can see the future, but no one remembers the past.  I give this a B+; I would love to put it in the A category, but it was a little too vague for me.  Like you needed to be almost an expert already on Russian history and European culture, to appreciate what you were seeing.  Magnificent (failure).  Better than most successes.",1408147200,4,5924,4.805528134254689

1885813,2,B00009NHAR,"Anyone who calls this work, ""brilliant"" is being really pretentious because on the whole, this is just an average piece on 'slavophile' culture in disguise. The director, whose boldness is like a blistering piece of annoying garbage on one's face on a cold Norwegian day, states that the, ""Hermitage is the greatest museum in the world."" Just from that statement we can then further evaluate that this film is 1) going to rely on manipulating history for its own plight 2) portraying Russians as 'wonderful people and 3) allowing us to see insignificant pieces of junk stolen from countless of eras in the museum. 4) He is completely insane.

The film itself was made on one shot by a half bald cinematographer from Germany who complained of back pain after the whole shoot because he was carrying a mobile camera that weighed 250 lbs. Further touches in the editing room configured rooms with dark shadows and an eerie earth tone that seemed almost 'dead like"" and made it seem like this was a Hollywood film.

There's not much in the way of the story except an unknown and unseen drunk, played by the camera itself, finds himself in a dank and stench filled restroom, which is actually the foundation of the Hermitage somewhere around the year 1689 and then he encounters a pretentious and annoying old count played by some Russian oaf. All he does is blather around and look at pieces for unusually long periods of time and comment on irrelevant tokens of opportunity such as a beautiful woman walking by who isn't hiding the fact that she has big [.!.]. They keep going into a time machine, which transports them into the next room of the museum, I kept wishing it was the exit, and they keep on commenting about the pieces and about the situation at hand. It isn't even philosophy because the old Russian crank is a really arrogant jerk and he keeps saying stupid things such as, ""I wonder if the Czar eats with butter?"". Its all terribly boring and we must sit through 2 hours worth of it until the end where a bunch of stuffy extras in period pieces dance around a ballroom with Tchaivsky playing in the background. Too bad he couldn't film the lot of the peasants who were freezing and starving to death!

There's not much to say in the way of art even, because most of it is fake to begin with, there was a fire in the Hermitage during World War 2 in which most of the museum itself was encapsulated within a great fire. Let's hope the director doesn't make a pure film on the virtues of Stalin next. (yawn, yawn)",1390435200,2,2522,4.5506607929515415

1885824,5,B00009NHAR,"Yes, this is an art film. Yet what so many miss is that it is less about the movie itself, but rather the achievement of making the film. As it is the best full length feature film shot in a SINGLE SHOT and SINGLE TAKE. There are no cuts, no splices, no edits. The story is actually secondary to the the achievement of what was involved in filming the movie. This is a cinematographers film for cinematographers and many film geeks. Thus the movie itself is not much for the everyday viewer.

What I did find more fascinating than the movie itself was the documentary about the making of the film. (found in the extra's section on the DVD) Which was actually much more enjoyable and informative. There you learn the story of what they were trying to accomplish and how they did it. The film was the fulfillment of their incredible achievement, but I found the documentary was the actual movie to watch. This documentary is actually what earned my 5 star rating.

A wonderful part of this entire film is the Winter Palace / Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg which is an amazingly beautiful palace and exceptional museum with an even more extraordinary history.",1388016000,,1160,4.62621359223301
1885825,1,B00009NHAR,"After studying Russia we checked this DVD out from the library via interlibrary loan.  After watching it, we found reading the reviews much more interesting.  Though honestly, after reading a few of the five-star reviews I am not sure we were even referring to the same film.  We would have enjoyed seeing the camera move around the Hermitage so the viewers could see the works of art.  But the ""Stranger"" distracted us from the art.

I am guessing that if we understood what was being said - really said - things might have been a bit more interesting.  But hopefully the English subtitles were just poorly translated.  They did not add much to the viewing of the film.  We weren't at first able to figure out who smelled of formaldehyde; the person asking wanted to know if he (whoever it was who smelled) was alive.  And we wondered who the ""madmen"" were going to eat - the man through whose eyes we were looking?

The scene where the young man stuck his head out the door, puffed up his cheeks and blew, then the Stranger did the same, was comic relief.  We had to stop the DVD until we all could catch our breath.

Do you remember the five year old whose parents sold her art, which was highly acclaimed?  Then when it was found that the ""artist"" was a five year old child all the artsy folks were indignant and incensed.  This film reminded me of that story.  The true art in the Hermitage was beautiful, but the film itself . . .  It might be considered ""art for art's sake"", but it really did not provide enough guidance for the audience as it moved through the Hermitage.  We had been looking forward to seeing the treasures in the museum, and we were disappointed that they were overshadowed.

The historical figures were not properly introduced in many instances, and the mumbling of the Stranger and the unseen man did little to enlighten the audience.  The film does have some interest, and it is really funny in some instances, while at other times it is just plain creepy.

On the other hand, it is pretty impressive that it was all shot in one take.  Just the coordination of everyone had to be incredible.  If the film was supposed to be a spoof, it did the job masterfully.  If not, well, at least it was ""different"".

I had hoped that this would be a nice culmination of our Russian study, but in retrospect we should have just stuck with our library books and watched Fiddler on the Roof instead.",1383004800,3,2416,4.463470319634703

Unless you are seriously into Russian art or enjoy watching one and a half hours straight of ballroom music and dance, I would not bother with this, it is far to overrated.",1371340800,3,311,4.43859649122807
1885827,5,B00009NHAR,"This film is a work of art. The question posed by the filmmaker is this: ""Are you interested in beauty, or only in its representation?"" You will have to answer this question for yourself. Clearly, the viewers who were bored by this film are interested in neither.

The Russian ""ark"" is the Hermitage, a museum that serves as a vessel that preserves the culture of Russia through the flood of change and through the sea of eternity. Within her halls are ghosts of the past, from Pushkin to little Anastasia. Two ghosts travel the halls, in a sort of hallucination that leaves the viewer constantly unsettled and unsure of his own point of view. (literally, as the film is shot in POV frame of the narrator ghost) In a gallery, we find a blind woman experiencing beauty without its representation. She ""sees"" the art in her mind and through her fingers. She is otherworldly, and yet she may be the most grounded and least ghostly character in the film. She loves beauty itself. The Marquis (the non-narrating ghost)is deeply religious and he sees a sacredness in the artwork. He seems angry with a young man who only sees a pretty picture. For him, beauty is a characteristic of God Himself, and art is divinely inspired. In a forbidden room, we find a workman making coffins from empty frames, and we are struck by the horror of a world without art, a world full of death, uncertainty, and oppression of thought. This vignette is a type of anti-beauty, and it reminds us of post WWII Russia. With that horrifying glimpse of the modern era, we understand why the ""ark"" is necessary. It is a shocking picture of an entire culture coming to grips with its collective mortality.

The ending of the ark is perhaps the most striking and emotionally devastating moment I have ever encountered in a film. It literally took my breath away. We sail on, and the ark sails on.

If you are not interested in the philosophy of aesthetics, or the meaning of culture, or the immortality of the human spirit, you will have a hard time appreciating or understanding this film. Also, if you are seeking a historical documentary with pretty costumes, you will be baffled. So I will say that the Russian Ark might not be for everyone. But if you are the type of person who is bored and annoyed by movies that resort to cliche and car crashes, prepare to be amazed. This film is truly great.",1369094400,2,2368,4.59338061465721

My criticism here is not about the film... it is what it is...  Rather it's about Amazon needing to do a better job of drawing attention to the fact that some of the films it sells are in a foreign language and to give people the information necessary to make an informed purchase.

1885832,5,B00009NHAR,"Although ""The Russian Ark"" may not be cinema's best overview of The Hermitage, this DVD is a stunning tribute to all those who produced it. Because the entire 96 minute film was taken with a single steadycam shot, it seems incredible that such a complex story could be conveyed with both superb attention to detail and seamless integration of setting and story. The steadycam operator performed like a world class athlete--going on and on and on--but equally amazing are the large number of extras whose collective performance seems like a labor to be achieved only through multiple takes. ""The Russian Ark"" is a remarkable film and, unquestionably, a significant hallmark in cinematic history. [Before watching the actual film you may enjoy watching the informative 40 minute discussion of how the film was made. This feature is included on the DVD. If you don't watch this accompanying discussion prior to seeing the film, be sure to watch it afterward.]

I've walked through the seemingly endless stairs and hallways of the Hermitage, and for the crew handling this film to navigate those ""hurdles"" as well as they did ranks as a significant physical accomplishment. From concept to post-production, director Alexander Sokurov has achieved a bit of a miracle.",1339459200,6,1262,5.12621359223301
1885833,5,B00009NHAR,"I have now watched this movie several times, and my appreciation grows for it every time.  There is something so unique, so thought provoking about it, that it cannot be dismissed as ""boring.""  Some of the single sentence comments are sufficient to start thinking, even something as basic as the Marquis' remark on the modern men's suits - that dressing that way stifled creativity.  (I have to agree that men used to dress MUCH better)

There is another interesting and positive aspect to the movie - I watch it walking and running on the treadmill.  Since it is shot in one continuous scene, with the cammera man (excellent work, Tilman!) walking, the pace on the treadmill keeps up in the walking speeds with the camera, and one feels like they are accompanying these two gentlemen on their journey.  And what a journey it is.  I can't afford the trip to St. Petersburg to see the Hermitage in person, but this movie is about as close as it gets, and having the historical events and figures interspersed throughout, makes it an enchanting history lesson as well.  Others have covered the music and costumes, and the director spared nothing on the details there, giving it accuracy and authenticity.

Finally, the message of the film is reflected in the reviews.  Some people appreciate art and culture while others don't see the importance in maintaining it.  The point of the movie is to show that the Hermitage is an ark preserving culture and tradition while tossed in an ocean of those who don't appreciate - the results of which are all around us.  Society degrades.  Excellent film.",1335225600,8,1592,4.787545787545787

1885835,5,B00009NHAR,"Russian Ark is a fascinating journey though space and time revealing the impact of European culture on Russia.  It begins with Sokarov's disembodied voice encountering the ""man in black', a French Marquis, who leads us into the Winter Palace built by Peter The Great indulging himself in his habit of bludgeoning his courtiers into submission.  The Marquis observes rather contemptuously, ""The more terrible the tyrant the more his memory is cherished ....He built a city on a swamp but the city is still European.""  The Westernization of Slavic Russia began in the early sixteenth century and evolved with Peter The Great who created St. Petersburg in 1703, a city modeled on rational ordered European design.

As we ascend a staircase of time and arrive in the Palladian Theatre of the Little Hermitage built for Catherine The Great by a French architect in 1780 they hear music and the Marquis remarks ""What an impressive orchestra, they must be Europeans.""  ""No, they're Russians"" the voice protests. Actually Tsar Peter had little interest in serious music and his musicians were conscripted from the soldiery irregardless of talent or interest, but the musicians that the Marquis hears have improved greatly under Catherine's rule.  And today we are treated to Valery Gergiev conducting the Mariinsky Orchestra in the ball-room scene.

""Russia is like a theater"" the Marquis laughs sardonically.  In Tsar Peter's day theater was virtually unknown in Russia except for a small theater Princess Natalya, the Tsar's sister, had established with amateur actors performing her own plays.  Peter invited a professional German theatrical company to reside in Petersburg but it never arrived, and the single little theater in the city soon disappeared.

They enter a gallery of bas-reliefs and the Marquis inspects the carvings.  ""So they are copies,"" he announces.  ""Your authorities don't trust your own artists....Russians are so talented at copying....You don't have ideas of your own-- your authorities don't want you to have them.""  The most telling moment is the shot of the cold storeroom filled with stacks of frames empty of Russian expression.

The appreciation, if not the creation, of pictorial art was advanced by Catherine The Great who ruled Russia from 1762 to 1796.  She was not Russian. She was German and she commissioned a French architect to design and build the Hermitage where she lived and amassed her collection of Western art amounting to some four thousand paintings.  ""It is not love of art. It is voracity. I am a glutton,"" she announced as she developed into the greatest art collector in European history.

The stunning beauty of Sokurov's film offers the message that Russia had been a backward Asiatic nation until it was transformed by Westernization.",1327276800,3,2784,5.178571428571429

My approach to this film was neither.  I found Russian Ark to be fun entertainment, a Fantasia-like journey through an incredible museum with incredible ""ghosts"" visiting from various time periods.  Although the way in which this movie was filmed was nothing less than ingenious, I never took it too seriously.  I found myself wanting to dress up in my own costume and join in the wanderings and festivities!  Boring?  No, no, no.

That is what is cumbersome in the movie where the whole idea, which I embrace from the beginning, collapses and brakes in milliards of confusing and under-developed thoughts. Fiasco is complete with incessant glamour that comes to ridicule. Finale is specific and it stands on its own; Mazurka is playing in a Tsar's ballroom and, to say finally stg. refreshing is spiced with the real performance of the famous orchestra and conductor, gorgeous!

My mind was blown by the high percentage of positive (often glowing) reviews by critics and non-critics alike. While the technical skill required to record the entire movie in one shot is impressive, the lack of compelling characters or plot resulted in my desire to stop watching the film shortly after it began.",1284076800,4,668,4.717948717948718

Sadly, and this may be my issue and not the film's, I faded after a while, despite the technical brilliance. I think my general ignorance about the history of the Hermitage and Russian painting made me appreciate this a lot less than I might have had I known more about the subject. For deep fans of the place and/or art, though, I can only imagine what a transcendent experience this would be.

To be honest, my favorite thing on the dvd is an extra, the Sokurov film Hubert Robert: A Fortunate Life. It really moved me at times, and I highly recommend it.

The other extra, a making-of doc about Russian Ark, is also worth watching even if just to marvel at how they shot this movie in one take with 2,000 extras, and made it work this well. Incredibly impressive, as is Sokurov's vision here.

Perhaps I'll return to Russian Ark in 20 years and know enough to really revel in its many glories. It truly is one of a kind.",1281571200,2,1196,4.373873873873874

In this film, the Museum is the central protaganist. All the actors, the French Marquis, the director's voice are just temporary visitors. The Museum is constant, timeless.
This film is very beautiful, very evocative and expressive. It is also a great way to see some of the Hermitage.

  This is a unique production.  Don't just pop it in the DVD player watch for three minutes, say ""yuk"" and eject it.  This movie grows on you if you have any interest in architecture, art, Russian history or film production.

  Russian Ark is an artistic representation of the history of Russian culture as captured and preserved by the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.  The art and culture of the Russian peoples has been preserved in the palace of the Czars known as the ""Hermitage"" through its history of war, fire, and revolution.  In this movie the Hermitage represents an Ark in which Russian culture survives the turmoil that threatens the Russian people.

  The plot is very minimal.  The camera represents a ghost who finds himself jumping in and out of various time periods following another semi-real character who is a French Marquis who has a haughty arrogant view of Russian culture as they wander through the museum/palace.

  Filmed entirely in the museum two days before Christmas on the only day of the year that the museum could be made available for the 2000 actors & extras and hundreds of technicians to literally re-stage 33 rooms of the historic palace for filming a 90 minute movie in one continuous uninterrupted shot.  The camera glides through the palace encountering the accurately costumed actors in short scenes of Russian history and culture in the palace of the Czars, from Peter the Great in 1700, to Nicolas II in 1913.

  The movie ends with a recreation of the last grand ball held in the ballroom that had not hosted such an event since Czar Nicolas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks during the Russian revolution.

  This production is in Russian with English  subtitles.  However, the story is a little hard to follow without some idea what the movie is trying to say, and the casual viewer will get more from the movie if the film is first viewed with the producer's commentary enabled.  The commentary is in spoken English and does explain the important points of the meager plot as well as point out the production difficulties of this totally unique work of art.

  Also check out ""the making of"" section of this DVD for more insight into the extraordinary efforts required to make this production possible.

  Viewing the movie with subtitles enabled you can engage yourself in the dichotomy of the European vs Russian mindset of the two main characters.

  Finally with subtitles disabled or sound turned off, let yourself relax and just watch the wonders of the architecture and priceless art of one of the most famous museums in the world as you've never seen them before.

You will never see another movie like this again.",1241654400,5,2723,4.8034557235421165

1885859,4,B00009NHAR,"I would be willing to bet that if you assembled a theater full of ordinary folk (not movie critics, graduate students, or film connoisseurs) to watch RUSSIAN ARK, more than half would walk out before it was half over. This has to be one of the most boring, tedious films ever made. It is also one of the most daring and beautiful visions ever recorded.

Sokurov takes us on a tour of the Hermitage, in one unedited, 96 minute tracking shot, and along the way, we encounter notable figures from the Romanov dynasty ( Peter and Catherine the Great, Nicholas I, Alexander III, Nicholas II and family) living in their natural habitat (the Hermitage served as a royal residence), doing normal things that monarchs do, like humiliating underlings, hosting foreign dignitaries, and giving grand balls for the aristocracy. The exquisite art and surroundings, gorgeous period costumes, lush orchestral music, and a cast of thousands, coupled with the ingenious filming method, create a sinuous, dreamlike, almost hypnotic mood. The camera's 1st person perspective has Sokurov (the modern man) confused, as if in a dream, following a gangly, Russian speaking French Marquis from the 18th century, who's dressed all in black, and frequently makes disparaging remarks about Russian culture. This ""guide"" is the focal point of the film, and acts as a symbolic link between Russia and Western Europe leading up to the Revolution. At points during the tour they enter rooms or galleries filled with modern people, who the guide can't relate to, so the contrast is not merely between cultures, but between the old and the new.

There is in fact enough symbolism and innuendo in RUSSIAN ARK to satisfy those afficianados of art film who demand it, but I really don't think the general public would get it. I would give it a 5 star rating if it could in some way communicate it's message better. Even so, it's groundbreaking technique should provide a unique experience for even the casual moviegoer, provided he or she is patient enough to sit through it, and at the very least, isn't lulled into a hypnotic stupor before the visually breathtaking ending.",1222732800,,2138,4.952646239554317
1885860,3,B00009NHAR,"ussian Ark (Russkiy Kovcheg) is one of those films more notable for the technical expertise it exhibits (or preens of) than any real artistic merit. It reminds one of Mike Figgis's 2000 film Timecode, wherein that whole film was supposedly done in four separate single takes, in real time. That claim was debunked by a simple watching of the film, and the film itself was notable for being a screenplay disaster. The four stories, which occupied one fourth of the whole screen the whole time, had volume turned up on one section while the others were backgrounded, and then switched, which made it difficult for the viewer to even stick with whatever tale he preferred. Technically, the film was a mess, and, as there was no real story, just a gimmick, the film bombed critically and financially. Russian Ark, made in 2002 by the infamously somnolent director Alexander Sokurov, has a similar gimmick. While not following four separate stories, it is claimed to have been shot in one continuous take, directly onto a High Definition portable hard drive. It also claims that it was shot over one day, and in real time. While not a technical film expert, I did notice several scenes where the camera passed over black spots, making it the perfect place for an edit to occur, so I tend to believe that the claim of its 87 minute single Steadicam shot are overblown, if not outright false, even though the filmmakers have stated that the completed, unedited film, was done on a fourth attempt by cinematographer Tilman Bttner. It could very well just be a slicker version of Alfed Hitchcock's more clumsy attempts in Rope.
  But, even if wrong, the film is still all style and little substance. Like Timecode, it has an execrable screenplay. Here is its sum narrative: an unnamed an unseen protagonist (voiced by Sokurov, and viewed from his eyes as the camera) wakes up on a winter day and is astonished to be in the 19th Century. He wanders into Peter the Great's Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg- which later became the Russian State Hermitage Museum, that nation's answer to The Louvre and The Metropolitan Museum Of Art. Whether this is a dream or a vision of the afterlife is unclear. The narrator has two companions- another unseen unnamed one, whose voice is heard, and a seen one- a French Marquis (possibly the Marquis de Custine, according to the film information extraneous to the actual narrative) who speaks Russian. He is played by Sergei Dreiden, and helps guide the two unseen travelers through the three dozen grand rooms of the museum. There, we see time flow back and forth from Peter the Great through Catherine the Great through the day before the deaths of the Romanovs through the siege on Leningrad, in World War Two, and back. Other Russian notables, like Alexander Pushkin, have cameos.
  There is also the feeling, watching the film, and even more so, listening the prattling on about the film in its DVD commentary with producer Jens Meurer, that Sokurov was trying so hard to make a film that was a masterpiece, as well as film history, that he forgot to master a good film. Ok, Russian Ark is not bad, and I'll likely rewatch it, as a curio, but that's it. One wonders what a real filmic master of the little moments, like Yasujiro Ozu, or a master of depth like Akira Kurosawa, or a master of ecstatic truths, like Werner Herzog, would have done with a project like this.
  In a sense, Russian Ark may indeed, in its better moments, achieve some Russian cultural relevance, but artistically it is pedestrian. Still, I would say see it once, if for the history and achievement- it's sort of like reading bad James Joyce. At least then you'll always be able to say, `Ah, yes, I've seen Russian Ark,' when that pretentious pal of yours asks that at the next party. That neither of you will be able to say much else with zest says all you need to know of this film.",1221609600,3,3890,4.6798245614035086

1885865,4,B00009NHAR,"This awe-inspiring film by Alexander Sokurov was filmed at the Museum of the Hermitage, former palace of the Tsars in St Petersburg, Russia. It was done in one take which is a first of its kind. The film is most unusual and creative in that it is narrated by a French Marquis who occasionally is a voyeur to Russian history as it unfolds while strolling through the Hermitage. History unfolds before his eyes and the Marquis occasionally interacts with various people of different eras whom he is viewing. This is a creative and magnificent production which contrasts the European viewpoint of Russian art, culture and history against Russia's own point of view of the same ...

The film begins in a haunting, dream-like manner when the French Marquis discovers himself in 18th Century Russia ... watching handsome young officers and their beautiful female partners enter the palace during the time of Peter the Great. The French Marquis is describing what he sees and interprets it for the film viewer, while another disembodied spirit, who has only a voice, occasionaly expresses the Russian point of view about the same scene. This film takes the viewer through 300 years of Russian history and at least four galleries of the Hermitage, as well as the ballroom and other private areas. The French Marquis opens private doors and enters into 18th century Russian aristocratic life. At one point, he recognizes the poet Pushkin during an encounter. The French Marquis also describes and interprets artwork by great Masters displayed on the walls, for instance, a famous painting by Van Dyke and a very exquisite marble statue of three naked muses by the sculptor Canova. The Marquis comments on Russian tastes in art and also about Russian music which he hears coming from a conservatory ...

Several of my favorite scenes are when Catherine the Great comes to life before our eyes. Catherine the Great was the founder of the museum. Initially, she bought over 200 paintings which now has grown to a collection of over 2.7 million items. There are five palaces which make up the complex. Her walk outside into the winter snow on the grounds of the Hermitage seems haunting, prophetic and beautiful beyond description. Another authentic looking scene is when a Persian envoy arrives before the throne of the Tsar, with the intention of creating a pact of peace after a Russian diplomat had been murdered in Tehran. The magnificence, grandeur and solemnity of the occasion is indescribable. One of the most impressive scenes was the ballroom scene, when handsome Russian officers and elegantly dressed ladies danced a mazurka to a live orchestra. The costumes were period pieces created just for this film, based on authentic clothes worn by aristocrats of that era. There was a great scene were the Marquis entered the dining room before the guests arrived for dinner. He admired the hand-painted blue and gold porcelain dinner ware (the real thing which was lent by the museum for use in the film). Another haunting and well done scene is when the Marquis enters a dusty room where he is admonished by ""the voice"" to not go. It houses remnants of the past related to World War II ... of which the Marquis would have no knowledge. He was told Germany and Russia went to war and the Russians paid a high price as over one million died. The film ends on a positive note, when the ballroom guests file out, walking down long corridors, and down marble staircases, wearing their magnificent finery, eventually to be escorted to their waiting horse-drawn carriages. The final scene shows an icey ocean which seems to represent the great Unknown ... the void, possibly Infinity.

This DVD has a great section, called ""Film in One Breath"", which chronicles how the film was made. There are comments by Alexander Sokurov where he explains his goals and intentions during the filming process. The camerman, Tilman B&uuml;tner, provides insights into the technical difficulties of making a film in one single take. The film was very expensive to make, it had a cast of over 850, most of whom wore 18th Century costumes made especially for this occasion. A special camera called ""steadycam"" was made in Canada specifically for creating this film. It was also the first of its kind. There were numerous organizational and lighting problems to overcome to create the right scene, with the right effects. Great challenges were arose related to set design, lighting and the proper use of architecture which obviously could not be changed.

Alexander Sokurov was also the director of ""Mother and Son"" another cinematic masterpiece with highly original filming techniques which made the film look like a French impressionistic painting that came to life. It told a very touching and sensitive story. Truly it depicts the Russian soul during its finest moment. Both  films ""Russian Ark"" and ""Mother and Son"" are highly recommended.

1885866,4,B00009NHAR,"The first ten minutes of the film are so dark that you wonder if something has gone wrong with your DVD player. Many of the incidents and comments depend on information that most viewers cannot be expected to know, so if you watch this at home, you have to keep Wikipedia up on your PC, so you can check.

If you know nothing about what is going on, parts of it can seem very silly. For instance, the rather strange tour guide walks into a room full of marble nudes by the noted sculptor Antonio Canova and starts crying out ""Mama! Mama!"" You may be tempted to start giggling, until you learn that the guide's mother was Canova's mistress. The guide is supposed to be the ghost of the Marquis de Custine, who lived from around 1790 to 1860 and traveled to Russia and wrote a book that expressed some appreciation of Russian life mixed with disdain, since he thought them inferior to Europeans.

Similarly, in one of the final scenes, you may not understand why the crowd of ballgoers is applauding the orchestra so feverishly, almost as if this were their last chance to hear them, until you understand that this scene depicts what actually was the last ball given by the Czar, in 1913.

Some people may find the whole thing simply boring, but it certainly grew on me, and I found it effective. Certain scenes have a quiet power, including an encounter with a blind woman who nevertheless is able to describe the paintings in detail, or a brief glimpse of Nicholas II and his family about to share a meal together, or a somber scene in which the present Director of the Hermitage converses, in a dark room, with the ghosts of his own father, his predecessor as Director, and the man before him, who was Director during the days of Stalin. The Stalinist-era Director wants to know if the Director's phone is still tapped by the government.

Some of this reminded me of Bergman, some of Robert Altman, and the ballroom scene of the end of Lucchino Visconti's ""The Leopard.""

The reviews here pretty well describe the spectrum of possible reactions to this film. If you are like some, you may hate it and feel like jumping out the window before it is over; if you are like others, you may want to appreciate it but still find it overblown and pretentious. For my money, the real-time, unbroken presentation, the winter afternoon with its fading light, the telltale signs of the Marquis being back from the dead (e.g., he confesses to having forgotten the taste of food), the somber lighting of most of the galleries and works of art, and the impending sense of time running out which hung over the whole film (and was a real, and urgent issue in its single-shot production mode) give the film a power and poignancy that make it worth watching.",1195344000,11,2740,4.560975609756097

I was aware that Russian directors such as Andrei Tarkovsky, in his film Andrei Rublev, use very long camera takes, which allow the viewer to become absorbed into the film.  This is much different from Hollywood movies and TV shows/sitcoms where each production is cut into countless short segments, resulting in a mishmash of pasted-together scenes, and scenes within scenes.... you get the picture.  Sokurov's  Russian Ark takes Tarkovsky's genious a step further, and this film is a miraculous single take that's over 90 minutes long.  Perhaps many people don't have the attention span to view this film without going to the frig, but it is quite easy to watch without interruption, and the viewer's attention span is improved (treated) after seeing this movie just once!!  You learn to love the European who leads you through the Hermitage museum and through 300 years of Russian history.  He is a tall, lean ""ghost-like"" figure who talks with the narrator of the film (the director Sokurov himself) and who interacts with paintings and sculptures and people/living ghosts from different epocs of Russian history.

1885870,4,B00009NHAR,"Every mention of Russian Ark dwells on the cinematic breakthrough of the single-shot feature film. But many aspects of the film make it different from anything else on the DVD shelf. Unlike most offerings, this isn't a story with a plot line, characters, and dialogue that go from point A to B. It's more of an immersive experience that places you as the viewpoint sweeping through vistas in Petersburg's Hermitage Museum.

The motion in Russian Ark is fluid, a flow of images that takes you through a tour of time and place, leaving you with a vague awareness of foregone days. The scenes are dressed in extravagant period costumes in majestic, vaulted spaces. Some of the images seem metaphorical, as is the title, of European cultures preserved beyond regimes and alluded-to invasions, a brief time capsule containing centuries of lives and experiences.

You feel like a voyeur, but one who has sparse context to frame the scenes. Much of the dialogue seems incidental, overheard, and with few exceptions not vital to understanding any overarching plot movement. If you treat it as a taste of a foreign culture, don't stress over understanding what's going on, just relax and enjoy the experience.",1186012800,2,1200,4.995
1885871,1,B00009NHAR,"He may nominally be a Frenchman, but the character of the ""stranger"" is actually a perfect likeness of the aging, no-longer-relevant Soviet dissident intellectual. He speaks in statements and accusations, ignoring or interrupting his interlocutor. His voice is always much too loud, straining, half-yelling. Even when he talks about aesthetics or spirituality, his tone always contains unpleasant, screeching notes of hysterical vulgarity. One glaring example occurs when he finds some Russian guy looking at a painting of two of Christ's apostles. The ""stranger"" asks the guy if he is religious, the guy says no. Immediately, the ""stranger"" harangues the guy with the line, ""How can you understand this painting if you don't know Scripture?"" He says this in a loud, stentorian voice, like the guy has some obligation to feel guilty in front of him. Then, tellingly, instead of developing this statement, he just repeats it, even louder, as if it's some kind of brilliant irrefutable argument. The guy stammers a justification -- he likes the way the artist depicted the apostles' worn faces and hands -- and the ""stranger"" mockingly repeats his words, as if his condescension alone constitutes a meaningful rebuttal.

The narrator's interaction with the ""stranger"" is similar. The narrator goes into a room and meets a famous person from Russian history, such as Czar Peter I. Usually, the famous person is seen doing something boorish and crude. The ""stranger"" gleefully seizes upon each occasion and rubs it in the narrator's face -- see, see, your great historical idols are so uncivilized and uncultured, and you admire them, so that means you're uncivilized and uncultured too, ha ha ha. The narrator tries to argue, but his half-hearted and ineffectual objections basically accept the terms of the debate. His responses run along the lines of ""Yes, but..."" and sometimes he just repeats what the ""stranger"" says without challenging it. In other words, he sounds like he admits his guilt for some great crime (the crime of being inferior, perhaps?), and is timidly trying to justify himself.

Consider the title of the film. The Hermitage is called the ""Russian Ark."" That is, the film suggests that the Hermitage somehow embodies the essence of Russian history and culture more than any other building. But this suggestion is very deliberate. It sets up the film in such a way as to allow the ""stranger"" to make one of his main assertions -- that Russians have no culture of their own, except what they allegedly plagiarized from other, allegedly superior cultures. Had the film taken place in the Tretyakov Gallery of Art, or in the Kremlin, buildings of equal historical stature to the Hermitage, the assertion would look silly, but the film bends over backwards to give it an air of legitimacy.

For the same reason, Peter I, Catherine II and Aleksandr Pushkin are all portrayed unflatteringly. All three were strong, independent figures in different ways, which is already enough to challenge the ""stranger's"" interpretation of history. So naturally they're his first targets, he has to ridicule them over and over, and woe to anyone who might admire them. But it's the poet Pushkin, not the czars, who gets the most hostile reception. The ""stranger's"" dismissive judgment of Pushkin is full of the aging intellectual's mean, cliquish snobbery: ""Oh, Pushkin, yes, I read him once, he's nothing special. Nothing special at all."" No argument, only airs and condescension. But Nicholas II, on the other hand, is a much weaker figure, and he's valuable for his status as victim, so he and his family are the only Russians whom the film depicts in a positive light.

At one point, the ""stranger"" wanders into a room where a disheveled man is making a coffin and yelling about death. The setting is World War II, during the blockade of Leningrad. But when the ""stranger"" asks what is going on, the narrator just says, ""there was a war with Germany,"" and the ""stranger"" (who is supposed to come from the past, before Germany was united) wonders what ""Germany"" is. In the meantime, the guy throws them out of the room while brandishing a hammer and yelling that everyone is going to die. It's as if there is no Germany, as if the blockade just happened by itself, and the guy is just displaying his inherent Russian savagery or something.

Then the narrator runs across a few people talking in hushed voices and making veiled references to their fear of the (presumably Soviet, but not stated) government. Someone says that the government never understands or cares about art. Yet this very film was supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, which is stated in the opening credits. Even though there's no real reason why Sokurov should be entitled to such support. Should the French government support a hypothetical film called ""French Ark,"" in which a British lord would walk through the Louvre and repeat over and over that the French have no culture of their own?

Quite aside from the content of the film, the script is appalling. The characters repeat absolutely trivial lines of dialogue multiple times, as if they carry great meaning. A typical exchange, as the narrator and the ""stranger"" walk down a hall, might go like this: ""These are nice pictures."" ""Yes, nice pictures."" ""Yes, they are very nice pictures."" ""Nice pictures."" I understand why so many reviewers called the film ""boring."" It's not the slow pace, it's the bad writing.

Anyway, eventually the narrator comes across a grand state ball. The ""stranger"" finally relents somewhat, in that he graciously admits that at least Russians know how to party. So, foreign audiences can congratulate themselves on their gracious humanism, after their cultural superiority has been reaffirmed. Sokurov can collect all the awards he can carry, and Russians, well, they probably don't even care about this film. And good for them.",1185235200,21,5914,5.0285714285714285

1885873,5,B00009NHAR,"The movie is a metaphor for the pre-revolution Russia told through the treasures and beauty of Hermitage. Spectacularly shot in one single take, this is a poem, not a movie. Only a person with good understanding of Russian and European history will fully appreciate what this film has to tell. It all sadly ended once the red criminals took over in 1917. The Russia and the Europe will never be the same. Parts of our souls had been taken away for ever.

No wonder some viewers in US discarded the movie as a pretentious art experiment. An illiterate person can stare at thousands of books and never grasp a single word from those pages. This is a movie for conoseurs of art, history and good cinema. If you are expecting pure, superficial entertainment, stay away.

Surely an hour and a half is not a huge ask of an audience by the director to  let him slow things down a bit?A beautiful toe-dip into the twin waters of art & time. Imagine if you walked through a gallery the walls came alive. That is more or less the essence of this film. It's a simple premise and works all the more beautifully because of it. Just slow down,and go with the ride. You won't regret it. For those who love the very nature of film composition,the success of using  the uninterrupted shot to convey the grand sweep of History will be a bonus. This is a challenging film but with a light emotional touch that makes it still very accessible. Think of it as a walking meditation on the roles museums play in storing the ephemera of a nation's soul for it's future generations. A beautiful & charming film.",1179792000,2,1240,4.872037914691943
1885875,3,B00009NHAR,"Years back, I saw the film NIAGARA FALLS at the IMAX Theatre in Canada. I was enthralled and moved beyond words! The film took me over the Falls. I heard and felt the mighty waters!.... I purchased the film at the visitor's center and went home eagerly to watch it. Well...after one watching,it sat never to be viewed again. Why? Because the filming process couldnot convey to the small screen! Hence RUSSIAN ARK,lavishly filmed with High definition cameras in one four hour take that sweeps (at times quite confusingly if you are not somewhat acquainted with at least the major highpoints of Russian History!!!!) through The Hermitage where all of Russia's past treasures and glory is contained (like the Ark of God from the Old Testament).This Alexsandr Sokurov ""life dream"" is HIS dream, and it is either going to impress you or bore you to tears. For the director to be commended is simply inadequate words,BUT what you see and feel when viewing RUSSIAN ARK in a theatre on a large screen equipped to convey the HD experience (similar to my IMAX debacle)what the director intended, and what you ACTUALLY get watching this film on either enhanced vhs or dvd at your home is simply NOT the same. As it is my intention to review the product RUSSIAN ARK:THE MASTERWORKS EDITION ,I must say ""Sorry ""for those who have had nearly orgasmic experiences concerning this 96 minute tour on Russian history.(Trust me,I repeat, that if you know nothing of Russian History you will find yourselves wishing you were at The National Gallery in D.C. looking at Picasso!)To have someone NOT spend good money on a product that is not what the director intended is worth my ""sour grapes"" .Unless this film is shown near you,perhaps at a University (where I recently saw it) or an Art Gallery or in a revival at a Movie House,I cannot recommend anyone buying this film and watching the aspect ratios changed,the colours dulled and the sweeping magnitude of the director's intention pushed onto a small screen.(The dvd extras are informative,but again,who cares when you cannot view the film as intended!!!YOU WILL NOT GET THIS FILM AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE EXPERIENCED!)When viewed outside it's original venue,RUSSIAN ARK,which apart from the technological aspects,really is a rather dull and lifeless narrative and the continued ongoing room-to-room tour will have you wanting to exit way before  the Museum doors close at 4:45. If viewed on a large HD-capable screen,the narrative is STILL dull and lifeless,but the senses will at least be satiated to linger a bit longer (though not much!).",1177286400,,2573,4.928571428571429

The cinematography & art direction was nice but other than that it was cinematic doodling.",1175558400,12,470,4.292134831460674
1885877,4,B00009NHAR,"Since I make it a point to forego reading reviews, plot summaries, and descriptions before embarking on a movie, the thing that intrigued me the most about Russian Ark was the metaphor: Where and What is a Russian Ark?

It was only halfway through the movie I realized the absence of that omniscient modern-day device in American moviemaking: 5 choppy angles and cuts-per-second a la Bruckheimer.  I ignored it and continued watching the film.  Of course, a part of me did marvel at the technical feat of pulling off such a long take, but to appreciate the Russian Ark because the movie was filmed in one continuous take, would be like asking someone to admire Proust's Remembrances of Things Past because it has 1.5 million words.

I'm not sure whether the trailers were geared towards American filmgoers, since the whole selling point seemed to pivot on the tagline: 2000 actors, 300 years, 90 minutes, 1 take.  How could anyone forget the almost non-sequitur American trailers to Bergman films in the sixties?

For fans of Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovski's work (whom Sokurov is seen as the heir), the notion of ""Sculpting with Time"" is brought to its logical and technological limit in Russian Ark.  The continuous shot utilizes formalism to create a flow that may take getting used to.  Having seen Sukorov's Second Circle and Robert Hubert: A Fortunate Life (a short that walks through the Hermitage Museum as well), I was prepared for a slow moving film.

Fans of period pieces will love this film as four years went into the preparation of this 90 minute sequence.  No detail was overlooked in costume design and set recreation.  What was astounding to me was the way the notion of extreme compression forced one to re-evaluate time duration itself.  In thinking about Russian Ark, one suddenly realizes just how much can be accomplished in the span of ninety minutes.  So this revelation, in itself, is Sokurov's great gift to viewers of Russian Ark: It's about the preciousness of time.

In the DVD extra, the narrator of the documentary reveals the metaphor of the Russian Ark.  I won't give it away here, but given the geographical locale of the Hermitage Museum, it is a gloriously apt metaphor.

Don't think about the technical aspect of it.  Enjoy the ride and you will spend countless hours reflecting about the fantastic closing.",1174953600,7,2349,4.891414141414141

Some of the compositions in this film are incredible, including when the camera travels down a hallway following a group of Russian princesses. Besides being an entire film created in one continuous shot, an impressive technical feat is the traversal between a warm interior out to the wintry outdoors and back. The lack of a narrative takes away from the film, but it may hold more interest with Russians or those who have studied Russian history.",1174003200,,620,4.594594594594595

The incredibly intricate detail of the costumes, the fantasticly clear works of art in the background, all gone.  And camera pans are blurred compared to the HD version.  Almost my entire enjoyment of this movie was due to the amazing HD.  Without it, this DVD will sit on my shelf, never to be watched again.",1168819200,20,584,4.342592592592593
1885880,5,B00009NHAR,"Other reviewers have commented ably on the fact that this film is an extraordinary tour-de-force and on the astonishing co-ordination required to make it.  Instead of echoing those cries of delight I would like to add something from a slightly orthgonal perspective.  In modern times we, as recipients of art, have become astonishingly lazy.  We have become accustomed to our entertainment served up in bite-size pieces, easy to digest and requiring no effort on the part of the recipient.  We watch movies that require no knowledge of anything, we listen to music that is banal in the extreme - the list goes on and on.  Even when we listen to more serious art such as a Mozart concerto we don't really know what we are hearing and consequently much of the power of the work simply passes us by.  But if we make a little effort, the results repay us a hundred-fold.  In the case of Mozart, when we know that the painfully beautiful aria sung by the Queen of the Night (in Der Zauberflote) is ornamenting a libretto in which her daughter is being enticed to kill her lover we are struck by the awful contrast between beauty and horror and the power of the piece is greatly intensified.  When we look at Holbein's painting The Ambassadors and we shift our viewing stance to the correct place where we can see the skewed-perspective death's head the painting takes on a deeper and darker meaning than we could otherwise have suspected.

And so it is with this tremendous movie.  Unless the viewer takes just a little time and trouble to become acquainted with the broad brush strokes of Russian history, many of the scenes will be nearly meaningless and certainly will lack the power and pathos they contain.  It's true that the character of the Marquis, who acts as our guide and anchor through the scenes, provides his own acerbic commentary on Russia, Russians and their history but it's an intentionally one-sided foil to the off-camera faux-naive mutterings of the film-maker himself.  The ""Russian soul"" has been shaped by many influences and some of the most painful have arisen from (and continue to arise from) the clash between Asiatic and Western European values and attitudes to life.  The setting of the Hermitage is the perfect place to explore some of these contrasts and combinations.  But without some foreknowledge the viewer will simply miss many of the allusions and references and historical figures (who come and go very fleetingly indeed).

If you happen to speak a little Russian you'll find much of the dialog is surprisingly easy to understand because there's a minimum of slang and both the principle narrators (the Marquis and the film-maker) speak in a fairly ""clean"" version of Russian.  I found that by the second time through I was following the dialog with ease.

Russia is a country that has had more than its fair share of trauma and strife, death and rebirth, hope and disappointment.  The film mirrors these contrasts, being on the one hand a recitation of the horrors (Peter the Great ordering the torture and execution of his son Alexei, for example) and yet also in itself a marvelous affirmation of what Russia and Russians are capable of (who else could have conceived and executed such an intense and masterful piece of work?).  If you have any interest in Russia, this movie is a must-see.  And if, because you're saturated with the drivel generated by the Hollywood studios, you've ever wondered whether it's possible to make a movie that isn't predictable, formulaic and outright boring then this movie will refresh your sense of wonder and lead you to contemplate what other marvels could be created if only people would begin to walk away from the boring, trivial, and silly productions of tinsel-town.",1168214400,6,3748,4.844827586206897

1885882,3,B00009NHAR,"Russian Ark has been promoted as a milestone in the history of filmmaking as being the first film ever made in a single shot. Sokurov had his camera tour the Heritage in Saint Petersburg (seat of the Czars from Peter the Great to the Bolshevik revolution) to show us his take on Russian history. The camera moves from room to room and we see Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, we see the son of the Shah of Persia apologizing to the Czar for an attack on the Russian embassy in Tehran, we see a magnificent ball in 1913, and so on. It's a technical tour de force, and it's a beautiful movie to watch. Yet, there's a shallow heart in it, since there's not much to read in it except Sokurov's nostalgia for Russia's imperial past (nothing wrong there, it's his prerogative to have the political views he wishes to have). Sokurov's politically incorrect views tend to be interesting (not having been born or raised in the west, he skipped all the pc nonsense; and not having been raised on the west's popular culture, he's also a man of a very deep culture, something unusual in western directors). Unfortunately, Russian Ark is unusual in Sokurov's oeuvre in being more interested in putting the director in the upscale commercial map than in making a movie that is thought provoking.",1167523200,7,1285,4.615720524017467

There were a few scenes that I think went on too long.  But overall I thought it was both a fascinating tour of the museum AND a great technological feat.  I can't imagine trying to do a one-take movie - it really boggles my mind and that's part of why I wanted to see it.  But it's not the type of movie I'd recommend to most people as I think they'd probably be bored.  A lot of people I know can't sit through a movie unless things are exploding every two minutes.

1885885,5,B00009NHAR,"Strictly from a technical standpoint, this film is amazing.  As we well know, it is shot in a single, 96 minute, unbroken take.  It was shot once after nearly 7 months of rehearsal.  It was shot on a specifically designed HD video camera that recorded the information to hard disk.  The disk could hold 100 minutes of information, but could not be recorded over.  After 2 false starts, they completed the film on the third take.  So many things could have gone wrong during this, but it didn't, thankfully.  Now, if this was just a technical stunt (like Mike Figgis's inferior film Time Code, which had 4 unbroken, 90 minute video takes), it probably wouldn't really be worth seeing.  Luckily, Alexander Sokurov tells a great story, filled with intelligence, passion, art, emotion, and the history of Russia.  This is not simply a technical stunt.  Sokurov wanted to make a film about Russia, its culture, and its relationship with the West, told through the art contained in the Hermitage.  There is a tender soul to this film, which makes the whole film overwhelming near the end.  Sokurov is an amazing filmmaker.  His other great films include Mother and Son, Father and Son, and Confession.  This is one of the most beguiling films I've ever seen, and it becomes more beautiful and wonderous with each viewing.  There is a featurette on the making of this film, which is completely fascinating to watch.  One of the camera assistants had a portable camera attached to them while Tillman Buttner (the director of photography) filmed this film.  So you get to see how intricate this film was, and how one slip up could have destroyed the whole undertaking.  Imagine someone slipping at minute 46 and saying ""ok, we have to start over.

1885886,4,B00009NHAR,"I found ""Russian Ark"" a fascinating work of a very ambitious director. For me, it was a highly enjoyable guided tour through the rooms, galleries, and halls of one of the greatest museums in the world. I have not been to Hermitage (Winter Palace) for over fourteen years, and to see the familiar rooms, stairs, paintings, and sculptures was like traveling back in time. The film is also the journey over three hundred years of the Russian history and the attempt to understand the country's place and meaning in European culture. Each of the palace's rooms is filled with memories, shadows, whispers, smiles, and tears of the people whose lives have made the history of the country. The fact that it is all presented in a single, the longest uninterrupted shot ever makes it even more incredible. I also saw the documentary about making ""Russian Ark"". It is called ""On One Breath"" - that's how the director, Alexander Sokurov wanted his audience to feel about the film that was shot in a single glorious take during several hours on one winter night. The preparation for this unforgettable night took almost four years.",1151020800,3,1119,4.833333333333333
1885887,1,B00009NHAR,"The preview for Russian Ark is fabulous, however one tiny detail that I overlooked at the time is that the preview gives no clues as to what the plot of this movie might be.  The movie is similarly lacking, but has other weaknesses that the preview didn't.

In the film a narrator wakes up after an explosion.  He reallizes that he is in the hermitage in the past and soon meets a black clad European (he doesn't say where he is from, only ""Strange, I never spoke Russian before."").  The narrator talks with the European, but not with any of the people they observe.  The European, on the other hand, interacts with the people they meet.  We see this as one continuous take seen through the narrator's eyes.

As they travel through the Hermitage, they periodically time travel.  They may cross a threshhold or turn around to find that modern-day tourists have taken the place of the Romanovs.  This would be cool if there were something going on.  There isn't.  At one point, it seems that people with whom the European was interacting, have time traveled with him so that 1800's people stand next to people from our time, but he and the narrator walk into another room and we never see any of those characters again, so whatever possibilities there were of a plot forming vanish.  (No plot ever forms, by the way.)

The fabulous preview was filled with costumes and scenes with lots of motion going on.  The movie has these, but almost all of them are in the preview, and it was only about 2 minutes long.  The movie also has a lot of slow pans over artwork or footage of the European walking down a hall of the Hermitage.  I think that maybe the whole point of the movie was to advertise, ""Hey, we filmed this in the Hermitage.""  These scenes are a bit dull, since the movie doesn't give background on what is being shown - it isn't anything like a documentary.

This review makes the movie sound better than it actually is.  It is very slow going.  I recommend everyone, normal people, libraries, university libraries, Russian teachers, to pass on this one.  If you must watch it, and at anypoint feel bored (and how could you not?) then I recommend fast forwarding until something hopeful happens.

1885893,5,B00009NHAR,"When I first hear about Sukarov's ""Russian Ark,"" most discussion centered on its nature as a feature-length single shot.  This in itself is an amazing achievement -- Hitchcock did something like this with ""Rope,"" but made some necessary (though seemless) cuts whenever the film ran out.  Sukarov's achievement is possible thanks to HD (high definition video) and it looks beautiful.  However, the technique is not an end in itself, but a means to an end.

The message of the film, according to its director, is that culture is like an ark in a turbulent sea.  It is culture that expresses who we are, what we feel, what we believe, and how we live.  The Hermitage is therefore much more than a museum, and this film much more than a colorful historical pageant.  It is a celebration of Russian life -- a poignant reflection on the complex and often convoluted journey of the Russian people through time.  Oftentimes the poignancy is expressed visually through ommission -- the charming but brief family dinner of Nicholas II and his family speaks of impending doom.  That the images are tranquil only heightens the contrast to the bullet riddled bodies we never see on screen.  Similarly, the final ball is almost surreal in its celebratory tone -- as the guests leave they speak of perhaps arranging another ball of their own, since this one was so enjoyable, but we know that their words are in vain, for their world is coming to an end, a fact to which they seem blissfully unaware.

Sukarov strives to shoot in real time -- thus no cuts.  An official apology delivered to Nicholas I is shown in all its splendor and forced pageantry.  Because there are no cuts, and because the camera meanders freely about the room, the scene seems much less like a historical reconstruction and much more like a documentary.

The tone is so real, in fact, that we feel as if we are actually seeing the real Nicholas I, playing with the real Anastasia, and following the real Catherine the Great as her feet crunch the snow in her thoroughly-wintered garden.  What could have been a ponderous cinematic exercise becomes a dream-like excursion through time.  We float, along with the camera, from room to room, taking in pieces of history, gazing at the marvelous artwork, and running into one great historical event after another.

Sukorov's succeeds in creating a meditative work of art.  Like many of his films, ""Russian Ark"" is best seen not as a film, but a dream-like meditation.  Those who have the patience and a contemplative state of mind will find a viewing of this film most worthwhile.",1133568000,5,2585,4.7685393258426965
1885894,4,B00009NHAR,"Ever since the creation of feature-length films, Russian Ark has been an inescapable inevitability. If you don't already know, it is the first and so far the only movie to be made in only one take. The entire film is one long tracking shot.

I went in knowing that, and I promised I wouldn't mention that fact in my review. But, like the film, it was an inevitability. However, I did not know going in that the tracking shot is a POV shot. It didn't really make much difference. We see through someone else's eyes, but never really get to know whose POV we share.

Shall we press forward?

The goal of the film is to visually capture three hundred years of Russian history. I myself am little familiar with the details recounted, but there is a strange hypnotic quality that kept me intrigued. It's impossible to judge the film by the same standards as one would most others because it's not really a drama. It's an onscreen ballet that turns the audience into one of the dancers.

The film didn't really inspire me in the way it was meant. Most of the film consists of watching people look at the art from collections held by historical figures. The cameraman and his European guide drift in and out of invisibility as they walk among the relics of the past, travelling between periods as they walk from room to room. Neither is sure how he ended up there, but they remain too in awe of their surrounds to bother. The truth is eventually revealed, but it is no huge twist given how strange the film is to begin with.

The film never bored me, but it never entirely captivated me either. It reminded me of the rides of Epcot at Disney. You strap yourself in your seat and let yourself be guided through an animatronic universe explaining whichever region to which the ride belongs. This dares to be a little more frank about its subject matter, but at the same time, you never quite feel transported the way you do on such rides.

If Fellini were to make an entire film based on the ending of 8 1/2, it would probably be something like this. Russian Ark is an interesting little epic that maybe could've done better with a plot.",1131235200,2,2128,4.4575835475578405
1885895,3,B00009NHAR,"I'll confess to being extremely impressed with Russian Ark as an artistic and technical accomplishment. I'm as impressed as anyone with Sokurov's ability to film it in one take (and the ability of the actors late in the film to keep their composure - the fear of messing up at the very end of the thing would probably have made me faint as soon as the camera turned in my direction), and the images are sumptuous and lovely. They could hardly be otherwise in as gorgeous a setting as the Hermitage (Winter Palace). I'm not a very good photographer, and almost every photo I've taken of or in the place over the years looks like a masterpiece.

This is clearly a movie in the strict sense of the word, but it's more like a piece of performance art than a movie. It has the power to move me, but I love Russian history and have studied it for years. If you don't know anything about Russian history, watching this film will be something like looking at a painting by Mondrian or Pollock after a lifetime of looking at Rockwells and El Grecos. It will probably leave you cold and baffled, but liking the pretty colors, costumes, and sets. I'd recommend spending some time with Pushkin, Catherine the Great, and Dostoyevsky before watching this. That won't guarantee that you'll like it (I can't really say that I do), but you'll have some basis for understanding it.

If it was Sokurov's goal to make something moving and emotional (I've read that it was), he wasn't entirely successful; if it was his goal to make something beautiful and impressive, he did a fine job. I can't help but feel, though, that beauty isn't enough to make a great film.",1130457600,7,1644,4.550675675675675

By the time that you realize that it has been an absolutely seamless journey, with NO cuts, NO splicing, no nothiing--absolutely none of the Conventions of Film that we all have become so used to, but the camera relentlessly rolling on and on, you will be amazed. If there ever was the mental equivalent of ones' jaw dropping open from surprise, then this is what happened to me.

  It is a quiet film that is actually a journey in time. Film buffs and History enthusiasts and most of all, lovers of the Hermitage will enjoy it. The costume details in the Historical segments are mind boggling. Every single detail in this film is done with absolute Zen-like care. It is all done in one enormously long take, which , logistically is almost impossible. It could not have been made at any other time than the present, and must have taken a 20 Terabyte drive to accomplish!!! Well done.

1885897,4,B00009NHAR,"Russian Ark is an unquestionably beautiful work of art centered and surrounded by art incarnate, the Hermitage. There are moments in the film where the beauty of the art, combined with the musical score and scene, transcends to something intensely emotional, yet not easily describable. Although this film is not for everyone (not even for many), it is for everyone wanting something more ethereal than the ordinary offerings.",1128124800,4,426,5.279411764705882
1885898,4,B00009NHAR,"One can't help but be amazed at the technical and artistic miracle pulled off by Alexander Sokurov and crew in Russian Ark.  This might go down in cinema history alongside Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, Godard's Breathless, and Antonioni's L'Avventura as revolutionary icons of filmic language.  Well, perhaps not that far, but time will tell. ;-)

As a narrative, the film is insightful and entertaining but hardly revolutionary.  What we get is a spotty rendering of Russian cultural history as manisfested in the halls and annals of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia.  However, it's cleverly told through the wanderings and confabulations of a semi-fictional French marquis paired with a presumably modern day accidental time traveler who's represented by an off-camera voice and a point-of-view steadicam.  Both find themselves, suddenly and inexplicably, at the Czar's Winter Palace in the 18th Century.  From there, it's a marvelous series of tableaus depicting various events, personages, and works of art which have held their presence there across three centuries.  We slip from one era to another as our wandering pair traverse various physical thresholds within the palace.

It's difficult to measure the film's resonance since one is simply in awe of the technical achievement--it was all shot in one single ninety-minute take!  The stagings and filming (on hard drive, but it looks like film) are a wonder of rehearsal, logistics, and precision timing--to say nothing of mental and physical endurance.  Yes, it was contrived as such, so perhaps the style ""is"" the substance here.  But when was the last time you've marveled at a cinematic technical achievement that occurs ""before"" post-production?

Whether one truly enjoys the film is probably dependent on one's appreciation of Russian history in relation to its culture as well as to that of Europe as a whole.  Just know that the acting, stagings and costumes are wonderfully authentic. The direction, cinematography, and sound are superb. Though the events depicted are mere snippets, they just might inspire one to explore further.

1885900,2,B00009NHAR,"This movie is a fantasy and runs off the gimmick that it was shot on one 96 minute take.

The movie is a homage to the St. Petersburg Hermitage State Museum, a place that has centuries of history to it. If it isn't, it should be one of the 10 Man-made wonders of the world. It is a place that is so vast, so enormous, that a film that has 2000 extras looks small within it's monstrous walls.

The movie begins with a person waking up just outside the museum. He encounters of Renaissance party-goers and believes that he is either watching a production or in a dream. Actually, he is out of his time, a visitor from modern Russian who has been teleported to a vortex where 300 years of Russian history will unfold before him. He is traveling with a French aristocrat/diplomat, who is also out of time. He is with us on our whole trip. The walk through the walls of the Hermitage and view art, sculptures, important periods in St. Petersburg/Russian history with people like Catherine II and Peter the Great coming in and out of the picture. The movie flows effortlessly through the rooms and each room portrays some topic of conversation, whether it is viewing a Persian diplomatic visit to Russia, or the French aristocrat making fun of sailor's uniforms or the modern suit. At the end, the movie ends with grand style at a ball that is a spectacle to view.

The gimmick of the movie is the fact that they filmed the movie in one take. While they actually had to stop 4 previous times, they were lucky on the fifth. This movie has the distinct honor of being the longest movie filmed on one shot. While this may seem like something trivial, it does provide a smooth transition between the rooms and the stories and the director pulls it off amazingly. It is not a perfect movie, but within the directors own limitations and rules, it was amazing they didn't give up.

The movie is far from perfect though. Those who are not familiar with Russian figureheads (like me) will not know who is what and what their importance is. The film characters does not bother to tell us on most of his observations and expect us to have a basic understanding of Russian history. Well, this will already alienate 99% of the movie going audience. Another problem is that this movie can be very pretentious at times and this is bothersome to a layman like me. One example is when the French aristocrat is looking at magnificent art, he starts critizing it for no other reason than Russia is a poor man's Europe. Again, it is dialog that will not be easily understood by a layman.

It's inaccessibility is the key problem with the movie. To those like me, it will bore me because I am never really included into the conversation or the events going on within the movie. I finally understood some when I saw the documentary, which explained who some of these characters were. For example, they mention Russia's finest poet, but they never converses in a way where those who are not knowledgeable of such things can be involved. Because of this, I can't recommend this movie.",1120694400,8,3054,4.535390199637024

For the average American Joe who lacks both knowledge of Russian history as well as lacking any clue about the world in which they live, then yes, this film may become tiresome.

Aside from its cinematographic feat, this film is the culmination of years of planning, countless rehearsals and the ultimate unveiling of the heart and soul of the Romanov Empire. Russian Ark is not just a novel idea, or a celluloidal act: It has the daunting distinction of daring to bring history to life and, then, resoundly succeeding! It is a romantic voyeur's dream: to wander the ""Russian Ark"" -- unnoticed -- witnessing events, large and small, breathing, drinking, savoring this amazing repository of art and memories. ""If walls could talk,"" some say. This unparalleled feast of a film allows us to be the ""walls"" of the Winter Palace, affording us a monumental view. In the end, like the French diplomat, one is reluctant to leave. Contrasts abound in this film, but there are no two scenes more divinely different than the final ball and the ultimate departure.

The narration-oh my- the narration is beyond words...

School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better narrators!  It is truly sad...

Another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot/storyline for which the writers and director are to blame.

The only positive aspect of the ""movie"" is the setting/location, which really is Russia; St Petersburg is beautiful!

Everything else, and I mean EVERYTHING else is horrendous!

In short, it could have been so much better if the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  What a waste of WONDERFUL costumes and an AMAZING setting!  The movie really did have the potential to be a MASTERPIECE, and this is NOT an exaggeration! A shame really...

1885906,2,B00009NHAR,"To enjoy this film you need the following:

1) Stamina.  This 90-minute film is, indeed, just one single take, i.e., when they made the film they just let the camera roll for 90 minutes straight.  No editing (except perhaps sound editing?).  The German cameraman, in an interview, complains that he almost died while shooting the film using his 30+kg Steadycam system.

2) Knowledge of Russian history.  The entire ""film"" takes place inside the Hermitage, a massive museum in St. Petersburg.  The film has actors dressed in period costumes and takes you through something like 300 years of Russian history, up to the Revolution of 1917.  If you know little about Russian history, you are bound to be very bored after the first ten minutes.

3) You cannot be cynical (like me) and believe that the only reason this film was made was so the director and producers could get into the Guinnes book of records for making the longest single-take film in history.  Ok, maybe also a bit of Russian nationalistic propaganda, but I can accept that since Russian culture and history are fascinating.

There's very little acting or story-telling, except for some historical reenactments which unfortunately are not familiar to me or my Russian friends when we watched the film together.  Even they felt immensely bored, so we ended up fast-forwarding the film and then watched a more entertaining French-American flick ""Wicker Park"" afterwards.",1110844800,8,1432,5.046808510638298
1885907,4,B00009NHAR,"Filmed in a single take, this movie allows the Hermitage to speak about Russia, specially its culture and history. Of course, that statement might seem a little weird, considering that the Hermitage is merely a building. But then, some say that no building is just a building, that we should consider them witnesses of our lives, and of those who lived before us  :)

If that is true, then the possibilities surrounding the Hermitage are enormous. After all, it is one of the greatest museums in the world, and before that is was the Winter Palace of the Tzar. Who could act better as witness to Russian history, and culture, and as an ark containing that?. I think that is just what the director, Alexandr Sokurov, thought. His idea must have been to allow a silent ""character"" to speak, and strangely enough, he succeeded...

The plot almost doesn`t exist, but don`t panic, some kind of movies don`t need a great one in order to be enjoyed. In this, the visual images take precedence to any kind of convoluted plot. The idea is simple: you are invited to a tour through the Hermitage, as it changed through the ages. There are no time barriers: only the Hermitage and you...

Well, I suppose that isn't entirely true: there are also another two characters, a French diplomat and a voice. Yes, you read that well: a voice. That voice belongs to a person we never see (as a matter of fact, it is Sukurov's voice), who accompanies the disoriented Frenchman in his tour of the Hermitage. The Frenchman doesn't know neither how on earth he arrived at the Hermitage, nor how he suddenly managed to learn Russian, but he doesn't seem too worried about that. Instead, he just seizes the opportunity offered to his senses, and studies the beautiful paintings and the extraordinary architecture. Due to the fact that time constraints somehow disappeared, he also gets to see some scenes of Russian history. He makes some illuminating comments, from the perspective of a Frenchman of the 19th century, of course.

On the whole, I believe this is a must see movie. However, you must keep in mind that its pace is sometimes too slow, so watch it only if you are fully awake. I have more than a few friends who have slept through long parts of this movie. That doesn't mean that it is bad, it merely  makes us aware of the fact that we should only watch it when we are in the mood for paying careful attention to details. The reason is that it is only then that you will realize what is so special about the ""Russian Ark"" .

While the idea of a single take 90 minute film is not quite so bad as some other Russian ideas, I agree with the comments that it makes for a somewhat difficult and at times lagging experience.

Still, all in all this is an interesting film, with beautiful costumes, wonderfull views of the Hermitage and the works of art, and engaging music.  I appreciate the effort that went into the making of the film, but perhaps it might have been a better film with out the experimentation. The technical lessons learned may have been worth it, but it does drag in parts. And at the risk of sounding Custainesque, I could frankly have done without some of the tortured psuedo-philosphical musing as well.  Like the son of producer Jens Meurer I did like the soldiers, and it was wonderful to see the ballroom scene... it was exactly what I thought when I visisted the Hermitage some years ago...wouldn't be wonderful if they could once again hold a ball here.

1885911,5,B00009NHAR,"Placed in the box of simply a grand, sweeping technical achievement by most viewers, Russian Ark proved to be on of the most unique and moving pieces of social commentary on modern Russia ever created. The film had a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere which was created most effectively by the technical achievement that most critics didn't see past.

  Russian Ark provided the single longest uncut shot ever recorded on film (1 1/2 hours). The entire duration of the film was a masterfully choreographed tour through  a beautiful Russian museum which required thousands of actors and two failed attempts until the film was completed without mistake. This alone should be reason enough to pique any film lover's curiosity. However, Russian Ark offers so much more.

  Coming into the movie, I had very little knowledge of Russian history. This may have hindered me from understanding some of the characters portrayed in the film (although I did pick out some of the more prominent figures), but it certainly did not hinder me from becoming enraptured in such a rich and nostalgic journey through a bygone era.

  This may seem like a light enough concept, but the underlying tone of the film is one of sorrow. With every frame, the director (who is also the narrator of sorts and the main character) seems to ache for a present time that is as beautiful as he sees his country's history.

  A truly haunting film, as well as an astounding technical achievement, Russian Ark chooses to show what it misses about Russia's past, as opposed to telling what it dislikes about the country's present. In doing so, it becomes one of the most mature and moving critiques I have ever seen.",1101945600,8,1678,4.84561403508772
1885912,2,B00009NHAR,"Anyone who calls this work, ""brilliant"" is being really pretentious because on the whole, this is just an average piece on 'slavophile' culture in disguise. The director, whose boldness is like a blistering piece of annoying garbage on one's face on a cold Norwegian day, states that the, ""Hermitage is the greatest museum in the world."" Just from that statement we can then further evaluate that this film is 1) going to rely on manipulating history for its own plight 2) portraying Russians as 'wonderful people and 3) allowing us to see insignificant pieces of junk stolen from countless of eras in the museum. 4) He is completely insane.

The film itself was made on one shot by a half bald cinematographer from Germany who complained of back pain after the whole shoot because he was carrying a mobile camera that weighed 250 lbs. Further touches in the editing room configured rooms with dark shadows and an eerie earth tone that seemed almost 'dead like"" and made it seem like this was a Hollywood film.

There's not much in the way of the story except an unknown and unseen drunk, played by the camera itself, finds himself in a dank and stench filled restroom, which is actually the foundation of the Hermitage somewhere around the year 1689 and then he encounters a pretentious and annoying old count played by some Russian oaf. All he does is blather around and look at pieces for unusually long periods of time and comment on irrelevant tokens of opportunity such as a beautiful woman walking by who isn't hiding the fact that she has big [.!.]. They keep going into a time machine, which transports them into the next room of the museum, I kept wishing it was the exit, and they keep on commenting about the pieces and about the situation at hand. It isn't even philosophy because the old Russian crank is a really arrogant jerk and he keeps saying stupid things such as, ""I wonder if the Czar eats with butter?"". Its all terribly boring and we must sit through 2 hours worth of it until the end where a bunch of stuffy extras in period pieces dance around a ballroom with Tchaivsky playing in the background.  Too bad he couldn't film the lot of the peasants who were freezing and starving to death!

There's not much to say in the way of art even, because most of it is fake to begin with, there was a fire in the Hermitage during World War 2 in which most of the museum itself was encapsulated within a great fire.

No matter how poor you are, as long as there is art around you, it brings joy and happiness to your soul, somehow. When you are surrounded by such beauty, one never feels  completely alone, and without art ""we are just little worms"" like this man said in the movie.

AND...they had only 36 hours to set up all the lights, props, etc. This is incredible. While we tour about 1 1/2 miles of this breathtaking museum and art collection, we also become acquainted with Russian history, the influence of Europe on Russian culture and a loose, ghostly framework of a story.

A great deal of time is spent viewing paintings, which is a good thing, since it did not add to the already extremely expensive budget(if my suggestions are to be meaningful, they should not be expensive suggestions).  When we get to rather expensive situations, such as our encounter with Catherine II, we only see her pretty face and learn that she needs to pee.  Why couldn't we have MEANINGFUL encounters with important historical figures, other than museum administrators?  The movie gets a little boring simply because we focus on one character only:  our French ambassador.  Even the orchestra conductor, in his interview, points out that the movie seems to come to life in the last scene; so why did the rest have to drag?

 If you restrict yourself to reading prose, without once in awhile recognizing the poetic that a contemporary writer might inject into the work, this is not a movie for you. No, the movie is not a poem, but it is poetic.

 A course in art history, and a passing knowledge of Russian history, would be helpful in approaching this film. I don't think that art history course is necessary -- but, as I reflect on it, that knowledge of Russian history might be.

 As with all works of art, the reaction of the recepient of the expression may have no relation to that which the artist seeks to express. But it may be the recepient's reaction that gives life to the work. Could Leonardo have imagined that however many years later someone would write a song expressing puzzlement about the nature of the smile on the face of a woman whose portrait he had painted? I suppose I'm suggesting that a viewer of this film can walk away with a universe of impressions.

 The movie is touted as a tour through a couple of centuries of Russian history by way of a tour through The Hermitage -- the supposed repository of Russian art and culture. It is immediately apparent that the art works that are viewed are not Russian. Throughout the movie, there is little reference to any native Russian art. The only acknowledgement of Russsian Art is in the ballroom scene, where there is a bow toward Russian music.

 My, admittedly limited, understanding of Russian history is that Czar Peter, known as ""The Great,"" tried desperately to Europeanize Russia. He succeeded, to the extent that the Russian asistrocacy adopted French as its language of court, and affected the manners of the royal courts of Europe. The movie suggests that this attempt to become European, at least at the aristocratic level, obliterated (denied?) the art of Russia -- the Russian soul.

 In the movie, the imminent destruction of the Russian aristocracy is powerfully presented in the scene following the ball, in which we see the members of that class descending a grand staircase toward their exit. Lest the point be too subtle, the viewer is treated to a subtitle that says: ""Goodbye Europe."" Yes, and it is also goodbye Russia, as they have known it.

 The movie was filmed in a continuous sequence, without cuts or, apparently, editing. Brilliant. The direction and cinematography are superb. That's all been said.

 Let's dispense with the conventional. What hasn't been noted is the film's unstated, but somehow felt, recognition of the ambiguity that is Russia. The film shows Russia's European face, but makes one wonder where, and when, the asian/slavic/whatever face of Russia will assert itself.

 A few paragraphs up, I stated that the film suggested an obliteration or denial of the Russian soul because of the aristocracy's adoption of European art. The film ignores, perhaps purposefully, the true expression of the Russian soul. Italy, France, Spain, and Holland have produced painters whose works approach immortality. But, is there a culture that has produced works that equal those of Dostheivesky, Tolstoy, Pushkin, Pasternak, Solchenisten? Perhaps locked into the artistic tradition of Orthodox icons -- post-Leninist heroism, or Stalinist repression, the Russian soul is expressed not through the visual, but through the telling of tales.

 On the surface, ""Russian Ark"" is worth seeing. The questions that I find posed by the film are simply a bonus. I rate it a ""must see,"" but only if you're prepared for a bit of tedium.",1091232000,9,3773,4.968203497615263
1885921,5,B00009NHAR,"A film shot straight in 90 minutes, in one un-interrupted sequence - no cuts- not more than one take for any of the scenes!
Not just that, Alexander Sokurov - the legendary Russian director who debuted in 1978 with his ""The Lonely Voice of Man"" has done so many firsts in the movie that this wonder just has to be taken seriously. Sokurov has generated his works at the cross-roads of two fundamental film genres: documentary and ""fiction"". After having made nearly forty films over a period of two decades he is still searching for the language of cinematography which, as he says, the now hundred-year-old child - Cinema, has as yet not been able to develop.
Shot in high definition digital format and then put on 35mm, this film used the latest in digital technology and was recorded, entirely, on a hard-disk. The movie is shot at The Hermitage in St. Petersburg and was the first feature to be allowed to be shot in the museum, or at least the first movie that wasn't about the Revolution. Hundreds of actors gathered at The Hermitage in 36 different rooms on the 23rd of December 2001 to shoot this movie. Shooting on the shortest day of the year, and balancing the light in that season in St. Petersburg for a one-take sequence of 90 minutes wouldn't have been an easy task mind you. The movie features live performances from 4 symphonic orchestras one of which is The Hermitage's own famous philharmonic orchestra. Void of modern cinematic luxuries, Alexander has, in truly a work of artistic genius, managed to add a touch of complete surrealism to the movie.
Set across four centuries in an extremely surreal time-travel fashion, the movie captures the life in and around The Hermitage and re-enacts moments of history and art in one of the most epic and elaborate fashion. Not for even a single second does the movie compromise on the theatrical details for the sake of the challenge of being shot in one take. Authentic costumes and the comments on the work of art on display at The Hermitage museum are immaculately detailed and accurate. The movie almost effortlessly takes the viewer through the history, like a story-teller talking about the ages in one breath. Not failing to capture the sentiments of the ages, you would find comments on the Russian dislike of the European, as well as the political bonds and resistances that existed between Persia and Russia.
Termed most often as one of the best post-soviet Russian movie, Russian Ark is more than just that. If it weren't a Russian Movie, or was set in centuries of Italian history, the world would have perhaps come to admire it more. Fully recommended to everyone for the storylines of the movie as well as for the flawless technical details. Surely goes down in the history of cinema as one of the most artistic works ever.",1090022400,12,2798,4.723926380368098
1885932,5,B00009NHAR,"Stunning. Visually arresting. Groundbreaking. Moviegoers who have seen Alexander Sokurov's ""Russian Ark"" know these terms apply in spades to this pioneering motion picture. Why? Because this little film set in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia is a period piece ranking right up there with Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon."" It is also the only film to date-that I have heard of, anyway-to use a single ninety-six minute shot. That's right-no cuts, no crazy zooms, no MTV style editing to be found in this film. It would doubtless entertain greatly to watch a person accustomed to Britney Spears's videos or the latest Vin Diesel film attempt to view Sokurov's production. I suspect they would either fall asleep immediately or suffer some sort of sensory input malfunction. A viewer who doesn't need a lot of flash, eardrum shattering music, or CGI effects to the nth degree is the ones who will get the most out of ""Russian Ark."" I suspect other filmmakers will soon attempt to replicate this director's pioneering cinematography in their own works, and that's all right. After all, Sergei Eisenstein's montage technique soon found innumerable copycats. What is it with Russian filmmakers and groundbreaking cinema? Must be something in the water.
""Russian Ark"" boasts thousands of characters, but the most important are a French Marquis and his Russian narrator. The nobleman suddenly ""wakes up"" in the Hermitage, surprised not only to find himself in Russia but also that he speaks Russian so well. He begins to stroll around the museum, taking in its artwork and the people he discovers in the various rooms. The Marquis is quite a character, a typical eighteenth/nineteenth century European that considers Russia a backward nation populated with barbaric Orientals and ruled over by bumpkin nobles. He often praises obviously European objet d'art even as he scoffs at the ""inferior"" Russian imitations. The good Marquis even has the temerity to criticize the type of artwork purchased abroad! His Russian companion tries to put up an appropriate defense of his people and his country, pointing out paintings and sculptures he finds marvelous. Still, the two disagree more often than they find common ground.
Something quite peculiar occurs as these two individuals stroll about the museum. Time is not what it seems in the Hermitage, as historical figures from various epochs in Russian history turn up in every room. The Marquis sees Peter the Great, Catherine, Pushkin, Tsar Nicholas II hobnobbing with his doomed family, a state visit from a Persian emissary, three directors of the museum pondering art, and an amazing ballroom party that is definitely the best part of the film. He also meets and argues with twentieth century Russians. Guess who we don't see wondering the halls in contemplation of the greatness adorning the walls? Yep, you got it. Nary a Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, or Khrushchev can be found anywhere in the Hermitage. The only visual reference to the communist years I saw was a scene where the Marquis stumbles over a freezing room with pictures stacked up against the walls while bombs explode outside, obviously a snapshot of the dark days of World War II. That last, lingering shot of the partygoers filing out of the ballroom only to confront a freezing ocean outside the doors is an amazing metaphor for Russia's culture. Always adrift between Europe and Asia, threatened from without and from within, Sokurov's film says that Russia did develop its own unique culture and that it must be preserved at all costs. That ocean, I think, represents not only Western European encroachment in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but the horrific nightmares of the communist takeover. Fortunately, the Hermitage-the Ark-protects Russia's glory.
Are there anachronisms in ""Russian Ark""? Probably, but I didn't see any leaping off the screen. I am no expert on Russian history, and definitely no expert on art, but I know more than the average guy on the street about these historical eras. The great thing about the movie is that you don't need to be an expert on Russia to get something out of it. If you don't understand the ins and outs of art or history, the splendid visuals and the anticipation that a cut must, absolutely must, happen at some point is enough of a reason to watch the film. The ballroom mazurka at the end of the picture can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of nationality or breadth of historical knowledge. Watching that colorful procession going on and on for nearly thirty minutes brought tears to my eyes. I can only imagine what effect the film would have on a Russian.
The extras make the disc. You get a commentary, a trailer, a behind the scenes featurette, a short series of interviews with the principal crewmembers, and a fascinating look at the Hermitage and St. Petersburg. I found the latter extremely interesting as it showcases several individuals associated with restoring the treasures of the museum, a resident of the city who often visits the Hermitage, and a father interested in teaching his son about the country. All of these people have a great love of the museum, the culture, and the country. Particularly noteworthy is the man with the phonograph. He looks like he stepped right out of a Tolstoy novel, embodying everything we associate with the archetypical Russian. He's happy even while sad, whimsical and deeply religious. I highly recommend ""Russian Ark"" to anyone looking for a magical film filled with beautiful images. It's not for everyone, obviously, but it is a treasure trove for those viewers willing to put forth a little effort.",1087862400,10,5638,5.043944265809218
1885933,4,B00009NHAR,"This movie, an uninterrupted segue through the St. Petersburg Hermitage museum, does what no movie has done before technically.  It's amazing that they were able to get all the actors, scenery and lighting in place in 36 rooms to film without stopping.  And, since the Hermitage could only close for one day, they had little time for mistakes.
While the technical work is admirable, I realized that I do like movies to have some cuts and edits.  Following a single scene for so long was dizzying and I ended up watching the DVD in two segments to give myself a break.  I also got tired of seeing so much of the back of the main character.
The story was also a bit confusing.  I saw in another review that someone got in an accident and woke up to this scene, but somehow I didn't catch that and was continually wondering who the main characters were.
The costumes are spectacular and the glimpses of Russian history, interspersed with questions about Russia's identity and place within Europe, are great.  The commentary on the DVD is also excellent and very much worth watching after the movie.
Overall, it's an interesting movie to see as a work of art, but it lacks a gripping story.",1087603200,4,1186,4.597156398104265
1885934,3,B00009NHAR,"I was extremely disappointed in this film.  I had wanted to see it for some time, and unable to secure a rental, I bought the DVD.
Technically, the film is an achievement.  Visually, much of it is stunning.  The costumes, the music, and the colors make you feel as though you are transported back in time.  The use of the two narrators, the French Marquis who was somewhat dismissive of Russia and the director who was proud of his country, was an interesting device.  For the narrators represent not only individuals, but also the conflict between Russia and Europe.
But there was something missing.  The moviemaker wanted to use the device of going back and forth in history in the Hermitage to explore some themes of Russian history.  Is Russia European or Asian?  Is it imperial or a victim of imperialism?  Does it have its own culture, or is its culture merely a copy of that of Europe?
These themes are explored, but unfortunately, in such a confusing way that one cannot decide if it is really important.
And Russia's great influence on the world, namely the Soviet state, is never even addressed except with a poignant scene where, against the request of the director, the Marquis enters a room to find a soldier building his own coffin.  ""One million dead"" the Marquis is told about the siege of then Leningrad, who remarks that the price seemed too high.
The movie is part tour of the museum, part history lesson and part discourse on Russia's place in the world.  But it bogs down into discussions of symbols in paintings, and Russia's relationship with Europe is forgotten.
The film was well on its way to a 1 star rating but for the last 15 minutes.  Yes, that portion of the film has the feel of a costume party, but one to which I would want to be invited.  The technical achievement of a single 96 minute take with a digital camera adds another star (the documentary about how the film was made is extremely interesting).",1085788800,6,1938,4.598837209302325

Everything else was horrible: plotless, uninformative, idiodic dialouge.

Please watch 'Moscow Doesn't Beleive in Tears', 'War and Peace', 'Freeze, Die and Come to Life', 'Battleship Potemkin"", or anything other than this rubbish.",1084838400,11,488,5.269230769230769

But we must remember that this is a RUSSIAN movie made for a RUSSIAN audience; and they're used to different things there.
The visuals in this film are among the best I've ever seen. And to think, it took me 10 minutes to realize they hadn't made a camera cut...
So, basically, I'll end on this word of advice: If you are a foreign film junkie who appreciates different filmmaking techniques, then watch this movie. If you aren't, go rent something else.",1084752000,4,616,4.820754716981132
1885937,5,B00009NHAR,"As I sat at breakfast with a friend of mine, he informed me that lovers of Russian history, such as myself, must see the film ""Russian Ark.""  Intriugued I implored him to share it with me.  Shortly thereafter we sat down together to watch this unsung masterpiece.  Simply put, I was flabbergasted.  Few have made and fewer still have seen such a piece of cinema.  What's more, few have seen such a work of relevance.  To the non-Russian this film will be a bit of a mystery... its important to have some vague proper concept of Russian history.  When I say proper, I mean it.
The film begins as a man of our days -- who is never seen and acts as our eyes -- finds himself before the Winter Palace in a time not his own.  As he wonders at this and follows a rowdy party apparently on their way to a ball he encounters a French diplomat also from a different era, this is the only man who can see our narrator.  As our eyes and the diplomat travel from room to room of the Palace a rich and mysterious history is unraveled -- the melancholy history of Russia.
At the risk of giving away parts of the film, I will say that some of the representations are rather striking.  Take, for example, the man in the cold chamber boasting to our French friend about his lovely coffin, then turning on him declaring that he is trampling upon the bodies.  In confusion the Frenchman turns to our eyes and seeks an explanation.  A war, he is told.  This is, of course, World War II.
However, all this aside, one of the most important lessons portrayed in this film is the tragedy of Russia's identity crisis.  Beginning primarily with Catherine, the European, Russia embarked in a devasting cultural makeover the effects of which left an invisible shrapnel on the people.  In my opinion this is most clearly seen when, as the guests leave the ball, one woman says to a friend ""It is as though it were a stranger's house.""  Russia desired to become a great European city, forgetting that they were Russians and unfortunately they still haven't determined what they are.
Now, about the filming.  The actor portraying our endearingly arrogant French diplomat deserves an award.  I cannot possible imagine the difficulty of his task and ignoring the absence of mistakes, his acting is superb... as he enters a gallery and throws his arms open in glee and occasionally finds himself dismissed from rooms.  A truly unforgettable character.
The very concept of a single shot is really quite amazing.  Forget lines for a moment and think of timing.  The term difficult comes to mind.
To make a drawn out idea simple, watch this DVD, repeatedly.  All of it.  Then watch it again, and again, and then learn Russian and watch it again.  I'm still trying to figure everything out.",1084320000,5,2752,4.558044806517311

Most of the reviews here tell you what you need to know.
I just wanted to share my impression.
The film is a visual masterwork.  The 90-minute shot notwishstanding, there isn't a thing on the screen that is less opulent or less pleasing to the eye than any other.
""Gorgeous"", as a defining term, just doesn't seem to do it justice.  The camera work is so fluid, so perfect.
However, there isn't much of a story here.  Just some loose bones to hang the images on.  It was a bit distracting at times, particularly the old man's ""umming"" and ""ahhing"" (which he does quite often).
Alot of this is due to the very bad audio dub.  Much of the dialog didn't match the actor's lip movements.
For some those are insurmountable obstacles to enjoying this movie.
If you look at it as a 300-year tour of Russian history, then you will be satisfied.
The Hermitage is an incredible place.
Many of the images from this film will stay with you for days.

The film seems remarkable in two respects: first, for the tour of Russia's magnificent Hermitage Museum and secondly  for the oft-remarked technical achievement of filming in a single 90-minute take.  Personally, I appreciated the first and was bored by the second.  Not only did it drive me, soon enough, to think ""So what?"", but after a while I found it very annoying and distracting.  Hitchcock filmed several films with self-imposed constraints -- notably, Lifeboat with one confined set and Rope in one-reel takes -- and in later interviews he said he regretted the artificiality, which he thought detracted from the films.  He was right.  Furthermore, the conceit of the narrative Marquis does not work -- his monologue is strained and, again, distracting and annoying.  What does work is the interesting idea of wandering between historical periods and  the remarkable setting.  You'd probably be better off watching a documentary on the Hermitage.

With Russian Ark, however, I've plumbed the depths of my vocabulary for a better word to describe it and I'm having a difficult time. The experience is little more than a endless waddle through an art museum with the world's most affected and tedious guide. I admit, the idea sounded great in print but the actual film experience comes off as esoteric, gimmicky, pretentious, dramatically barren, unnervingly hammy, high school amatuerish and, well, boring.  It appears the filmmaker just wanted an excuse to get a bunch of friends together for dress-up in a lavish dollhouse and the idea eventually got way out of hand.

This movie takes place in St. Petersburg, Russia, and  brings us ninety minutes of the history of ""The Hermitage Museum"" told in an unusual image of the 18th and 19th centuries. The remarkable piece of this movie is that it is shot in one fluid take using High Definition video cameras.
The State Hermitage is in actuality 6 buildings on the embankment of the River Neva. The most magnificent of the buildings is the Winter Palace, residence of Russian Tsars from 1754 to 1762. The Hermitage took 2 1/2 centuries to build and exemplifies pieces from the Stone Age to the 20th Century. There are over 3 million pieces of art on display from Da Vinci to Monet.  Some of the most exciting times took place during the German Invasion in 1941. We are indeed fortunate that many hid the treasures within, and that the treasures were found after the war. The Hermitage is open to the public and you can find more information on their web page:
 [...]
867 actors practiced for months to dance the mazurka in the ballroom, march to a military salute or watch a theatre performance. There was one take only and anything could go wrong at any time. There were years of development and preparation for the 4 hours of filming. Sokurov depended upon German HD specialists  KOPP MEDIA to assist with the details of the script. How a camera would move, the distance of feet to be covered in the narrative, and the use of a steadicam. A hard disk recording system was developed that was portable and equipped with an ultra-stable battery. One shooting day with 4 hours of light was the magic number.
A Marquis, a limber European in dress black is the film's guide. He is invisible to most and he leads the narrator through each room and gallery. He interacts with guests but others do not see the ""ghost"". The Marquis takes us from the 17th century to the present. We meet Catherine the Great, Nicholas I, and there is no explanation of what is happening or what are their roles. We are left to our imagination and the beautiful rooms and halls and galleries that are The Hermitage. The last thirty minutes are dedicated to 3 orchestras and the ballrooms and the dancing and the exquisitely dressed people of the times.  We are but trespassers in this venue, but we are left to wonder the marvels of The Hermitage, and the wonder of this film.  prisrob",1075507200,134,2452,4.625287356321839
1885948,5,B00009NHAR,"I am actually rating this film from a standpoint of a Russian soul that loves Russian history and is proud of my heritage.
So much has been torn apart as far as Russian history is concerned within the past 15 years, and 70 years before that, I really did not know what to expect when I sat down in the theater.  Will this be popularist Hollywood type dancing through the Winter Palace with scenes of epique, Gladiator-type battles unfolding on the walls of the Palace?  That is what I kind of expected - why would a movie any different from that make it to US theaters?
Well, that is not what I saw.  I saw a nostalgic, often out of place in time, view at what I learned for so many years.  I saw director's cry for times long gone, I saw the emotion, love and understanding, of little, seemingly insignificant pictures of Russian history, flash before my eyes.
I think reviewers who rated this movie as boring or without point, grossly misunderstood the idea and the goal.  Throughout the movie, you see a series of little re-enactments that often ended in a pose that is similar/same to the paintings located in the Hermitage.  That is where the paintings come alive.  Like the whole scene with Nicolas II's family gathered around the dinner table and as the camera pans out, everyone turns and looks into the camera.  I vividly remember the painting, and only then did it hit me - the meaning, the tragedy, the emotion.  I understood the painting!
Same thing can be said for many other scenes like that.  But the most powerful scene of the movie is at the very end, everyone is leaving the ballroom, the awkwardly translated phrase ""This is the flower of young Russia"" and finally, the stranger saying I'm staying...

1885949,5,B00009NHAR,"""Russian Ark"" by Alexander Sokurov may be interpreted as a film based on a fairy tale structure, which presents the story of the hermitage museum in St. Petersburg, a city which was built at the same time as the palace. Both city and palace have witnessed grandiose and terrible events, while today the former winter residence of the Czars is one of the most famous museums in the world.  The director, Alexander Sokurov takes the viewer along for a visit of the museum, which comes alive with the events that have marked its history in a fairy tale like manner. The viewer is taken for a ride on history, and the historical figures appear at corners and corridors of the palace inviting us to along this journey. Technically speaking the film is remearkable as it as shot entirely in one take; however, it is a film where beauty is expressed almost entirely on a visual level. I visited the Hermitage after seeing the film and could not escape viusalizing events without Sokurov's iimages interfreing. As I saw the portrait of the Persian Shah Abbas, who visited Alexander II, I also grew to appreciate tthate scene that reconstructs that event even more; indeed, it is one of the more effective ones in the film.",1075075200,3,1214,4.699530516431925

But instead of a feast we are treated to nouvelle cuisine which is on the surface interesting but in the end, unsatisfactory.
I have never seen a movie so frozen into the past as Russian Ark is. Its brief forays into the 21st century sit uncomfortablly between vignettes of Catherine the Great and Nicholas II. Brief references to the 900 day seige of Leningrad are left unexplained and inexplicable to the uninformed. This is a cold, grey and essentially humourless work. There is no emotional connection in this ""film"". No spark of humanity, no human warmth, no engagement. The film bares as much life as the cold unheated halls of the Winter Palace.
And the corpse-like character of ""The Stranger"" (how droll) serves no purpose but to irritate where it could have enlightened or intrigued. The occasional comment on Russia's relationship with Europe attempts to give gravitas, but just leadens tha atmosphere even further....
And as a technical piece it leaves a bit to be desired. Perhaps it was just the print I saw, but the colours seemed washed out and drab where they could have been sensuous. Perhaps this was a problem with the digital media that the ""film"" was shot to . Also, the continual flaring of the camera lights on the oil paintings was irritating and showed a lack of thought, especially considering it had been rehearsed thoroughly before hand.

1885951,4,B00009NHAR,"The most remarkable thing about RUSSIAN ARK is that it was filmed with a Steadicam in one unbroken take ninety-plus minutes long utilizing a couple thousand precisely cued and magnificently costumed actors. This was necessitated by the fact that the location, the Hermitage Museum (the former Winter Palace) in St. Petersburg, Russia, was available for only one day. But where did they rehearse? And most important, did Hermitage staff allow the actors to bring munchies inside?
As the film opens, an invisible individual (let's call him ""The Visitor""), through whose eyes the viewer takes this journey and whose voice is that of Director Alexander Sokurov, is admitted to the snowbound Winter Palace with a group of uniformed czarist army officers and their dates arriving for a gala event. The Visitor soon leaves the revelers behind and joins ""The Marquis"" (Sergey Dreiden), a Frenchman that serves as the guide for most of the movie. As The Visitor and The Marquis go from room to room, they and the viewer are either in the present, surrounded by modernly dressed tourists, or in some century past, fleetingly meeting such historical figures as Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, and Nicholas II. Ghosts, perhaps?
RUSSIAN ARK is primarily a magnificent visual introduction to the Winter Palace of the czars, and one most likely to be useful to one who hasn't experienced the place firsthand. This fact, and the cinematic achievement represented by the skillfully choreographed action photographed in the single take, would otherwise cause me to award 5 stars - except for the dialogue (Russian with English subtitles). The majority of the words spoken by The Visitor, The Marquis, and those they encounter convey little of import or relevance. Indeed, what emanates from the preoccupied Marquis isn't usually much better than distracted mumbles.
For those acquainted with Russian history, one of the most poignant scenes is when The Visitor and The Marquis encounter Nicholas II's young daughters - to be brutally murdered by the Reds within a couple of years - breezily skipping along the palace corridors. And the climax of the film is the last thirty minutes or so as the viewer mingles among the elegant, pre-Revolution crowd dancing in a glittering ballroom, and then exits with the throng down a spectacular gold and white grand staircase and out through a long interior promenade.
Needless to say, RUSSIAN ARK has no plot in the conventional sense. Had the various scenes been shot separately, they'd be nothing more than a series of unrelated vignettes of marginal interest.
RUSSIAN ARK is a film only possible after the implosion of the USSR. It's a peek at a grandiose and ""decadent"" way of life now gone from Russia - and Europe - for many decades. If you can't make it to Peter's city on the Baltic, then I recommend this film.",1074470400,13,2847,5.008438818565401
1885952,5,B00009NHAR,"I watched Sorkurov's film for the first time last night and thought it brilliant. It was fascinating how though a 90 minute film of a canversation in the Hermitage seemed rather boring I was pleasantly suprised. I found it very interesting how the film came together at the very end. I didn't really comprehend it until I saw the sea. I them understood that Sokurov meant the Hermitage to be the whoel of Russian culture since the czars. Absolutely fascinating, one of the better films I have seen in a while.",1074297600,3,509,4.604395604395604

The visuals were astounding, the music brilliant.
I watched the HDTV version of this movie, so I cannot comment on the DVD features or quality.

1885954,4,B00009NHAR,"In the history of cinema, it is the Russians who are generally credited with elevating film editing to a modern art form.  It is ironic, and strangely fitting, therefore, that it should be the Russians who, almost a full century later, have now produced the first full-length feature film ever to be composed of a single unedited shot running uninterrupted from first moment to last (Hitchcock came close with ""Rope,"" but he did include a few ""cuts"" in the course of the film).  Even Sergei Eisenstein, who, in films like ""Potemkin"" and ""Ten Days That Shook the World"" spent his career developing and demonstrating the power of editing, would, I dare say, be impressed by ""Russian Ark,"" a film every bit as innovative and challenging as those earlier seminal works.
For their bravura, awe-inspiring cinematic tour-de-force, director Alexander Sokurov and cinematographer Tilman Buttner take us into the famed Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, providing us with a grand tour not only of the opulent rooms and famous artwork contained therein, but of 300 years of Russian history as well, as various vignettes involving famous people (from Peter and Catherine the Great to Nicholas and Alexandra) and events are played out within the glorious gilded walls.
""Russian Ark"" is a bold and audacious project that is the cinematic equivalent of a breathlessly performed high wire juggling act.  We know that one false move on the part of the actors or the cameraman, one missed cue or accident of fate could bring the whole delicately poised enterprise crashing down around them.  How often, one wonders, did a perfectionist like Sukorov have to resist the temptation to yell ""Cut!"" to his actors and crew?  It's truly amazing to see just how beautifully planned and flawlessly executed the final product turns out to be, especially the ball sequence at the end which features hundreds of dancers and spectators who are set in beautifully choreographed and constantly whirling motion.  What's most remarkable is how much of a participant the camera itself is in the proceedings.  Not content to stand idly by and observe the scene like some passive onlooker, the camera moves right into the center of the action, gliding in and out of the crowds with utmost grace and precision.  Visually, the film is stunning, with exquisite costumes and furnishings as far as the eye can see.  Indeed, ""Russian Ark"" is, among other things, a veritable feast for the eyes, the likes of which we have rarely seen on film before.
""Russian Ark"" does have something of a ""plot,"" involving a narrator whom we never see, a 21st Century filmmaker - we assume it's Sukorov himself - who's found himself inexplicably caught in some type of time warp and magically transported to this strange spectral world.  There's also a bizarre European ""ghost"" figure from the unspecified past who comments - and occasionally attempts to intrude - on the actions taking place around him.  But these two characters are of far less interest to the audience than the aural and visual delights of the film itself.
""Russian Ark"" is a wonder to behold, for it is much more than just an ""exercise,"" a ""gimmick,"" or even an ""antithesis"" to Eisenstein; it is a vibrant work of art that challenges the limits of its medium and reminds us of just what it is about movies that we love so much.",1069459200,14,3357,4.90299823633157
1885955,5,B00009NHAR,"There is little doubt that RUSSIAN ARK created a milestone in filmmaking. A phenomenal amount of time, energy, and money went into the production of this film. The cast included 867 trained actors plus more than a thousand extras and dozens of horses and carriages. Filmed in one continuous shot inside the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, RUSSIAN ARK portrays 300 years of Russian history filmed in 33 museum rooms with three live orchestras. For ninety minutes the camera followed a man dressed in black who is product of the past. As he moves from gallery to gallery it is revealed from his dialogue that this man is a historical diplomat from France. He has much criticisms and critiques of Russian art and culture in contrast to Europe. Important moments of Russia's past are intertwined with the man's visit to the Hermitage. The past comes alive and the viewer is a voyeur to these historical events. I was fascinated and intrigued while watching this film as I was transported to the past. The music was tender and delicate and the costumes and makeup were elaborate and detailed. RUSSIAN ARK portrays a fusion of Russia's culture and art. I highly recommend watching the special feature ""In One Breath"" which is both a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the making of this film and a director's and cameraman commentary.
In short, I absolutely loved this film. My only regret is that I didn't see it on the big screen.",1069200000,18,1434,4.833333333333333

1885957,5,B00009NHAR,"A dream-like tour through the Hermitage in Petersburg, bringing the old halls to life in a visual tour-de-force.  Sokurov glides through this film using a single camera and never breaking stride, led by an odd stranger who finally finds his place among the many chambers of the grand Winter Palace.  This is a movie not to be missed as it takes in the grand sweep of aristocratic Russian life from Peter the Great to Tsar Nicholas. Rich in detail, poignant in its telling, the film rises and falls as though scripted on musical scales.  So many allusions that one can watch it several times and it would still retain its magic hold on the viewer.  Of course, a little knowledge of Russian culture would help in understanding the nature of the film, culminating its deeply felt view to the sea.",1068163200,5,793,4.642857142857143
1885958,5,B00009NHAR,"This is a gorgeous movie that everyone should view at least once in their lifetime.  Director Alexander Sokurov creates a visually beautiful and thought provoking tour of the famous Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.  We accompany a long deceased French diplomat who travels across three centuries of Russian history.  His witty and sometimes sarcastic remarks reveal the attitudes of one of his station in life during the eighteenth century.  The Hermitage has a very cruel and haunting history.  Russian nobles such as Catherine the Great were dictators indifferent to the suffering of the common people.  Many paid dearly to put together this fantastic collection.  One can almost sense the ghosts who still roam the Hermitage's many rooms of breath taking art work.

I am, though, afraid that many might ignore the Russian Ark due to the snobbish comments of certain members of the cinematic intelligentsia.  These folks get overly excited about the fact that the director completed this film in an unbroken 90 minute span.  Needless to add, most of us could care less.  We are only concerned about the finished product.  Thankfully,  Sokurov and his crew have succeeded beyond their wildest hopes.  Every academic and artistic institution should own a copy.  Parents might also wish to purchase the dvd edition.",1065744000,12,1317,5.1753554502369665
1885959,5,B00009NHAR,"One of the most visually stunning films ever made, Alexandr Sokurov's RUSSIAN ARK is a landmark creation on many levels, many of which have been touted in numerous articles and reviews.  From a purely technological aspect, it's the first feature-length film ever made using a single camera photographing a single 96-minute shot in one take, with no edits.  The documentary feature on the DVD gives the viewer an inside look at the challenges of this approach - made more daunting by the fact that during the winter in St. Petersburg, the crew only had about 4 hours of daylight with which to work.  The logistics requiring the crew surrounding the camera - including the director - to stay out of view, even as the cinematographer spun 360 from time to time, are a major work or choreography in themselves.  Sokurov's dedication to his project - and the dedication of his crewmembers - is both apparent and very moving.
In an interview included in the `making of' documentary on the DVD, the director states `I'm sick of editing.  I don't want to experiment with time.  I want to screen real time - it should be as it is.  One doesn't have to fear the flow of time.'  So many filmmakers are so concerned that their audience's attention span is so short that they will become bored if things don't `move right along' - it lowers cinema to the `lowest common denominator', fails to challenge the audience, and, in the final analysis, insults the viewer's intelligence.  There's no danger of that in any of Sokurov's work - the viewer's mind (and emotions) are given quite a workout, and, as with physical exercise, are stronger for it in the end.
Some critics - who perhaps have no patience for being required to think about what they're seeing - criticize Sokurov and other visionary directors (such as the great Andrei Tarkovsky) as being cold and emotionless.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Sokurov has stated in several forums that one of the goals of RUSSIAN ARK - and all of his work - is to evoke strong emotions in the viewer.  The methods of his creation might be different from those we have come to expect from the major Hollywood studios - but they are very effective, and more thought provoking in the bargain.
In RUSSIAN ARK we experience Russia's treasured museum, the Hermitage, from the point of view of a `visitor' - we never see his face, only hear his voice and thoughts (by Sokurov himself) as he walks through the Winter Palace, viewing tableaux from 300 years of Russian history enacted before his eyes.  He is accompanied for most of his journey by another character - unnamed in the film, but based on the Marquis de Custine, who published a travel book in 1839 entitled EMPIRE OF THE CZAR:  A JOURNEY THROUGH ETERNAL RUSSIA - with whom he converses and debates the scenes they see before them.  We witness Peter the Great berating one of his generals;  a play written by the Tsarina is performed for her and selected guests;  the appearance before the Tsar of a delegation from Persia, there to apologize for the murder of a Russian diplomat in their country;  a grand ball featuring a full symphony orchestra and hundreds of dancers (perhaps the visual climax of the film);  and in perhaps the film's most poignant moment, we witness Tsar Nicolas and his family dining together, blissfully unaware of their impending fate.  Along the journey from room to room, from tableau to tableau, the viewer, along with the narrator and the Marquis, can gaze upon some of the most breathtaking art the world has ever produced.  Even the building itself, with its incredible architecture and opulent outfittings, is a character in its own right - Sokurov's vision has brought the Hermitage to life in a way that draws the viewer right into every frame.
The director has succeeded marvelously in his effort to show the `living' aspects of history, of art.  Museums have an undeserved reputation for being `dead' places - they couldn't be more alive.  The dangers in abandoning or forgetting our past have been shown time and time again, in both social and political theatres.  As the Marquis states at one point during the film, `Everyone can see the future - but no one remembers the past.'
Sokurov stated that he had long held a dream of `making a film in one breath' - he has achieved that beautifully in RUSSIAN ARK, and it will take your breath away as well.  This is cinema for the time capsule.
As far as I have been able to ascertain, the only other Sokurov film available in the US is MOTHER AND SON - check it out as well, and pray that more of his work will become accessible.
The best way to see any great film is, of course, on the screen - so don't pass up any opportunity to experience him in that way, either.",1064275200,149,4749,4.638424821002387
1885960,4,B00009NHAR,"After an accident, a man comes to in complete darkness, not sure where he is.  When his eyes focus, he sees before him a carriage of aristocrats hurrying through the cold to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.  Invisible, he follows them into the palace where he meets a French Marquis.  Together, they roam the halls of the Hermitage, discussing art, people and Russia while spying on Catherine the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, Pushkin and other great figures of Russian history.
Director Aleksandr Sokurov has chosen to tell his story in one continuous 96-minute shot -- a first of its kind.  No editing or film breaks; just a single take, almost as if you were walking through the Hermitage with the characters.  What also makes this film unique and beautiful is the seamless intermingling of time periods.  In the hallway, it's the grandeur of the 18th Century with tsars and tsarinas, but open a door, and you step into the 20th Century where the general public can come to view the magnificent works of art.  Through another door, and you're following Anastasia as she runs down a hallway dressed as a nymph to have a final meal with Nicholas and Alexandra.
I saw the film in the theater and am impressed with the DVD.  The picture and sound qualities are very good.  The ""Making of "" featurette is definitley worth watching, and, to me, is just as intriguing as the film.

7992018,5,B00009NHAR,"This movie was absolutely breathtaking and intriguing on many levels. The filming is dreamlike, but engaging.

Throughout the movie, you follow a Russian man and European writer as they walk through the St. Petersburg Winter Palace Museum commenting on the art and architecture and briefly interacting with historical figures. Russias role in the history and its future are the topic of the film. It is very philosophical in nature, and to be honest I didn't understand all of it. I suspect that as an American there are probably some cultural barriers to my interpretation. Anyone can appreciate the beauty of this film, but I think those interested in history would get the most out of the commentary.

The filming was an absolutey enormous undertaking, as the camera follows hundreds of actors and actresses in one single shot encompassing the majority of the St Petersburg Museum. Much of the symphony orchestral music is live, and I recognized the famous Valery Gergiev as the conductor.

The non-linear flow through Russian history is somewhat haunting. It leaves you feeling somewhat lost; struggling to understand the bigger picture. I think that may be intentional.

There is a lot more to say, but I will leave it there. This is an absolutely unforgettable film. One I highly recommend, especially to anyone interested in art, history, or philosophy.",1507852800,3,1360,5.112612612612613
