I thought it might have been an excellent and obscure exploitation film from the 70s, but it turned out that it was nothing special. It delivers very little in terms of nudity, and basically nothing in terms of gore. There's some very quick shots of full frontal nudity during some fake but fairly well done B/W crime scene photos; then there's a topless scene with some girl when the maniac breaks one of her fingers; and there's a topless scene with a girl in the shower, but you can't really see anything because it's filmed through a closed shower door. The only gore is just some quick glimpses of some mutilation during some B/W photos, and you've got this girl tied up with a gash in her leg; I'm not sure if you'd call this gore, but that's it. Aside from a neck snapping later on, the deaths are off-screen. Even at the end of the film when the maniac is killed, you don't see any blood. The film does, however, have some things going for it. I thought it was a well directed and acted film. It also provides some decent atmosphere with the darkness and some Ok locations where they filmed it. The story is simply about a serial killer who kills women with the entire case trying to be solved by the police. It's a well made film, but many may be fooled into thinking that they're buying a sleazy and gory slasher. There're some slow parts, but most of the film moves decently. If you like 70s films, you might be interested in it. However, you may not want to pay that much for it. I got a new copy from a seller at a really cheap price. I'm not sure, but it may be an OOP DVD. If it's OOP, you can still get it as of the time I'm typing this at a very low price. It's well done with a nice 70s style, has some pretty good suspense, and provides some decent atmosphere and scenery. Just don't get you're expectations too high.

The interviews are good, and the commentary was very well done. The stills gallery is decent, and you get an alternate title sequence under THE DARK RIDE title. The deleted scenes extra is nothing special and has nothing worth mentioning. It also has a pressbook easter egg, the original trailer, and other DVD trailers. The DVD quality is excellent.",1399593600,2,2251,4.385167464114833
8275478,2,B0019X3ZNQ,"This Ted Bundy-like thriller plays more like a TV  movie with bits of nudity, a little violence and some bad language. A few good scenes, but basically boring.",1385683200,,159,4.678571428571429
8275479,3,B0019X3ZNQ,"Killer's Delight, also known as The Sports Killer and The Dark Ride, is a serial killer film from 1978 that is not especially frightening, insightful, or suspenseful. The basic premise is that young women are turning up dead, evidently victims of the same killer. Sgt. Vince de Carlo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Luisi/dp/6305161895/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Luisi</a>&nbsp;and his psychologist girlfriend (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Susan-Sullivan/dp/B001XRLWPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Susan Sullivan</a>) are on the case, but it's clear that their involvement also puts them at risk.

There are some nice aspects to this film. It's generally well acted and does a fairly good job of capturing the look of the late '70s (always interesting for nostalgia). At about 80 minutes, it's lean and doesn't overstay its welcome. But in the end, there just isn't all that much to recommend about Killer's Delight. Apparently, this movie was loosely based on the real-life&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ted-Bundy/dp/1416559590/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ted Bundy</a>&nbsp;murders.",1302739200,6,1218,7.4
