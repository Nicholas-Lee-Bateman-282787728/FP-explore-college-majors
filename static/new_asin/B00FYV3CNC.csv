6040129,5,B00FYV3CNC,"Gorgeous ride through different sections of Kauai. I visited Kauai a few years ago and always wanted to spend a little more time on the roads, most of which overlook the ocean. Whether the road is inland on the island or has ocean views, it's all a spectacular ride. There are several options. On my first workout on Disc 1, I chose the live instruction, which turned out to be an indoor cycling class doing a virtual ride along with those of us at home. He 'interviewed' several riders and just chatted about nothing much in particular. On my second ride, Disc 2, I chose the ride sounds with coaching, without music. Next time I'll probably choose coaching, with music, for variation. The warm-up section is great. It includes magnificent views and a few glimpses of the riders preparing to start. The cool-off segment was the same, riders chatting with each other after the ride, congratulating each other on their hard work. The ride is a very realistic experience of a day cycling in Kauai. This is one I will watch over and over and over again.",1384819200,2,1050,4.620320855614973
8619537,2,B00FYV3CNC,"I was really hoping for a video that would focus on the scenery of Hawaii.  After watching the backs of other riders going down city streets, and listening to the same kind of music on the video that one would expect to hear while being placed on hold during unusually high call volume, I just turned it off and watched a good movie.",1481932800,,333,4.285714285714286
8619538,5,B00FYV3CNC,"As usual from Cylcing Fusion, the video is excellent. Coaching is good and if you tire of it, you ride with only music, which will keep you pumped up. the first two rides are fairly tame but the 3rd one called Killer Climb lives up to its name. A very good set with variety so you can ride as mild or tough as you want on any given day.",1399075200,,336,3.8840579710144927
8619539,5,B00FYV3CNC,My sister bought these DVD over the holiday as the weather outside wasn't agreeable for cycling in the North East. We have trained with several other virtual cycling videos in the past but these rank as our favorites. The map feature is awesome b/c it gives you a bird eye view of the route and not just the road ahead. The dashboard are great and help you get the Watts in. I think the most impressive thing is the video quality. It helps that the leader actress is the Hawaiian landscape but the video is not jumpy and doesn't make you seasick. The other great option is that you can change your audio options. Great video set for the snowed-in cyclist.,1395360000,,655,4.421487603305785
8619540,5,B00FYV3CNC,Great rides from a great company! Beautiful scenery presented in the videos and I like the addition of the Google map during the ride. I wouldn't expect anything less from this company!,1394668800,,185,4.8125
8619541,4,B00FYV3CNC,I love the different challenges that each DVD in the set provides and really appreciate the fact that Class Builder has been built-in throughout (very helpful for those who are doing winter indoor training).  I really appreciate the first DVD as it is a totally different challenge than other DVDs from Global Ride....Heart Zones remain low at the start and consistently move upward until you hit the peak.,1394582400,2,406,4.970588235294118

8619543,5,B00FYV3CNC,Never been to Hawaii?  Stuck riding in your basement during the winter?  This is just the DVD set to get you motivated for summer.  The set has every type of terrain that you need to ride with and is well narrated.  Get motivated... buy this set like I did!,1394582400,,257,4.183673469387755
8619544,5,B00FYV3CNC,This series is for both beginner to advanced.  Fantastic location as always and like all of the series you can make it as easy or as hard as you'd like.  A keeper!,1388534400,,163,4.0625
8619545,5,B00FYV3CNC,"Weather outside cold and dark? Why not pop in a DVD and have a great indoor ride.  This set has 3 virtual rides in Kauai that give you options for climbing, high cadence work with coaching or just enjoy the scenery.  The music keeps you up to tempo, or can be turned off.  There is a profile on screen that lets you see some recommendations for heart rate zones if you desire. I find these rides a better workout than a spin class and I don't have to pay each time I ride. I never get bored compared to watching TV or reading a book while on my trainer. I highly recommend the Kaui series.",1386201600,,589,4.104347826086957
8619546,5,B00FYV3CNC,As an Indoor cycling instructor 4 days a week at our local YMCA I was pleasantly surprised by this 3 disc set. Over the years I have tried several training videos from other vendors and have not been impressed. I have been using Cycling Fusions  Class Builder for the last two years and decide to give the their Kauai Rides videos a try as I was seriously considering being part of the ride when they were searching for guest riders a couple years back. When you're looking for inspiration and you want to turn in a good work out these disc are for you. Very professional and breathe taking to behold. If you are going to be cooped up all winter these are the rides youll enjoy the most.,1385596800,2,687,4.325581395348837
