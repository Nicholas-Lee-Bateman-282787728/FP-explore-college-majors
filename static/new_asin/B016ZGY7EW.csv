8737650,3,B016ZGY7EW,"This is not a beginners DVD and this is not a complete practice.  You will have to build your own practice with this DVD, you can use an beginner-intermediate DVD and then create intervals to practice the different sections of this DVD. It was a step up from a demo.

Chapters:
Vibrator Technique:
Running Man:Plank lunges, mountain climbers,mountain climbers to the side all in plank
Donkey Kicks:
Handstand Press up:Show you how to get into a wall handstand
Hand stand scorpion: Handstand starting from a forward bend into scorpion-Starts from a forward bend as well with variations-she goes into full wheel/complete back bend.
Forearm scorpion:
Wild things: Downward dog, back bend, back into downward dog
Dancer: 2 Variations.
Inner thigh Flexibility:
Mermaid:

The main reason points were taken off was:
1.) You will have to build your own practice with this DVD.
2.) I would have preferred to have maybe a downloadable practice session that would help you create a practice that shows you the best moves to start with to build up to these movements in one session.
3.) Do to the 2 above the shelf life will not be that long. Since this is not a follow with DVD after you have the positions down you really will not need to reference the DVD again.
4.) The DVD states (This is an all levels class) but an absolute beginner would truly be lost. After you have some practice with the basic movements and anatomy of yoga then you will be ready to start this DVD-But I truly believe intermediate and those in the process of creating their own yoga sequences will benefit the most from this DVD.
5.) Some of the poses she does on the front and back of the cover are not covered in the DVD.
Pro's
1.)If you can build your practice with this DVD-you will definitely be taking your arm balances to the next level.
2.)The movements seem accessible-when trying  the movements/variations seemed doable-obviously not at the level that Dashama is on but I was able to at least start the movement.
3.)She definitely links the movements so to speak-I understood the concepts of how she went from downward dog into donkey kicks and how those would get you into a handstand.
4.) She does say how many counts to do for most of the movements.

Extra Comments:
I.) do not normally comment on things like this because it seems mean to say the least, but she talks a lot and pretty fast. Before I had the chance to digest one thing she said, she has moved on to the next. It seemed pretty anxious.
2.)She goes into forearm scorpion while drinking from a coconut?  Unnecessary.
3.) I would have preferred a complete yoga DVD with this information added in sequences so that you could practice to build up to the poses and the poses themselves all on one DVD.

Does it do what it promised:
Beginners:advance your inversion and arm balance practice: I give it 50/50 for lack of build up to practice these movements
Intermediate to advanced: Increase strength and awareness to be able to transition between advanced yoga poses: I give it 50/50 for lack of build up to practice these movements

I purchased this DVD for $11.00 and change-was it worth it..I would say yes.  I found some of these same chapters on YouTube.",1458259200,4,3198,4.656028368794326
