4526591,3,B0051ZIXJO,"If you're looking for Samantha from Sex and the City, forget it. Kim Cattrall shows her acting chops and plays an entirely different character here. This film is held together by Cattrall; in fact, until she shows up, it is difficult to watch. Once she appears though, the film starts picking up and ends up worth watching.

Cattrall plays Monica Velour, an over the hill porn star who is short on money and energy. She wants to get custody of her daughter, but with a jerk of an ex-husband hellbent on on putting her down, Velour can see no other options but to go back to stripping and porn. Meanwhile in the state of Washington, Tobe (played by Dustin Ingram), is a 17 year old who likes old music and 70s porn starring Monica. Living with his grandfather, he sees very few options for himself after graduating from High School until he happens to see that Monica will be stripping at a nightclub in Indiana. Not caring that she is some 20-30 years older from the peak of her porn career, Tobe embarks on a road trip to Indiana to finally meet her in person. The movie goes back and forth from heavy-hitting/unpredictable to sweet/predictable; the relationship between these two unlikely people is fascinating to watch, thanks to Cattrall's performance. Ingram plays the part of an extremely awkward teen well, but it is difficult not to think of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Napoleon-Dynamite/dp/B00005JNBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Napoleon Dynamite</a>; Ingram's character seems to be entirely patterned after him. The ending is fairly satisfying, although it does seem a little rushed and clipped together. I could have used a few more scenes about Monica and her journey before seeing a photo of a postcard that signifies a rushed (and somewhat unlikely) happy ending for her.

Good quality image and sound on this one, but the Blu-ray is very light when it comes to special features. Included are a few deleted scenes (which are actually enjoyable and probably should have been put back in) and an audio commentary by writer/director Keith Bearden and Cattrall.

Enjoyable if uneven movie that had it been better, could have made Cattrall an Oscar contender.",1314489600,7,2214,5.127423822714682
4526592,3,B0051ZIXJO,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Meet Monica Velour has some pretty serious problems, but this merits saying: Kim Cattrall is amazing in this film. If the film were of a different genre (i.e., not an adolescent comedy), she'd be looking at a nomination for a little gold statue (like Marisa Tomei in The Wrestler). Because this is a sappy comedy, Cattrall is unlikely to get serious recognition for this flick, but she deserves it. In fact, she's pretty much the reason this film exists. Cattrall is most famous for playing the sex-obsessed Samantha on Sex and the City, and she also co-authored a book on finding sexual satisfaction. In Meet Monica Velour she puts a pin straight to her sex-goddess image, deflating it completely. From her extra weight and lack of makeup to her downcast eyes and defeated body language, Cattrall takes her sex-kitten persona and shows what decades of hard living can do to a centerfold. Adjectives like ""brave"" and ""bold"" sound natural when describing performances like these, and Cattrall earns her kudos honestly here.

Keith David gets a lot less screen time than Kim Cattrall, but it's nice to see him play something other than the heavy. Sure he's relegated to the role of the ""magical Negro"" who leads our white hero on his journey of self-discovery, but it's nice to see him in a comic role where he doesn't have to be scary at all. In fact, I'd like to see a whole movie about his character, a black artist living in rural Indiana after surviving the art world. Maybe Meet Claude would be a great sequel.

This DVD of Meet Monica Velour isn't bad either. The anamorphic transfer does a fine job with detail and color saturation, with no serious compression artifacts in sight. Black levels are consistent, and the generally muted landscape of the film has an appealing quality. The 5.1 surround track does a fine job with dialogue, and offers more clarity than the 1930s music can take advantage of, though the surrounds don't get much use. The extras start with an 8-minute reel of deleted scenes (including some extra nudity from the actress playing the young Monica) and the film's trailer. The centerpiece, though, is the commentary track from writer/director Keith Bearden and Kim Cattrall. The pair is obviously proud of their achievement (and Kim has reason to be), while their track shares a number of behind the scenes tidbits (including the fact that the hot dog wagon was stolen after filming) and real-life inspirations for the character of Monica. It's a lot more entertaining than the movie, truth be told, and only confirms Cattrall's hard work on the film.

4526593,4,B0051ZIXJO,"This is basically a charming little ""coming of age"" indie movie. I found it fun. Kim Cattrall's star turn is quite good, high-quality acting, and the young hero is believable and effective. Brian Dennehy gives a solid if underbilled performance as the young nerd's grandfather, as well.

The makers created some ""Monica Velour"" adult features from the pre-video age that will amuse anyone who remembers that era - they obviously had a lot of fun inventing period products. I enjoyed this aspect of the movie, but wish they had given Annie Sprinkle or Kay Parker or someone a cameo -- that would have been great!

Despite dealing with adult themes and sex work, this is not a very salacious movie. There are a few quick glimpses of partial nudity and some explicit language, but 90+% of this movie is PG or purer. There's more smuttiness in any teen-age slob movie, these days. You'd have to be exceptionally prudish to be offended by anything here.

This film is adult in the best sense - it avoids cliche (mostly) and takes a thoughtful, reality-based approach to age and our world. It's nothing heavy or Kosmic, but a it's warm, hopeful, and interesting little movie. You could do worse.",1313539200,6,1189,4.762135922330097

He likes things no one else does like 1920's music, but his favorite thing of all is former adult film star Monica Velour (Cattrall). After his Grandfather (Dennehy) insults him one too many times Toby decides to leave, and meets Monica. This is the type of movie that when you watch you like it, but when its over and you look back on it you start to like it more and more. I snickered a few times watching, but when I remember the lines and context I laugh harder. This movie is a surprisingly sweet coming of age tale about a boy on his way up and a woman on her way down. I have a bad habit of, for lack of a better word, over-simplifying a review by comparing it to movies people have heard of. That said...this movie is a cross between ""Napolean Dynamite"" and ""Boogie Nights"". If Napolean met the Julianna Moore character from ""Boogie Nights"" you would have this movie. I will have to say the Kim Cattrall is the perfect choice for this movie and while not being the total opposite of Samantha she is more of a burnt out version of that character. I would love to see at least a Golden Globe nomination for her for this, but I doubt that will happen. Overall, a good movie that will grow on you. I give it a B

4526616,5,B0051ZIXJO,"What makes Meet Monica Velour so great is that it brilliantly captures a young 17-year old teenager who's absolutely obsessed with the girl of his dreams (who happens to be an ex-porn star) so what's a young frisky guy to do?  Why, take his weener mobile across country to Indiana and finally meet her in person!

He's basically your ordinary teenager... well I mean, as far as lacking ambition when it comes to serious matters and instead focus on chasing a piece of tail.  He's certainly VERY strange in several other aspects.  After high school graduation, like most kids he doesn't have a single clue what he wants to do with his life, and his family is giving him grief about all the time he spends alone in his room and fantasizing about his dream girl as indicated by all the posters and movies he has of this woman participating in sex acts.

When he finally arrives to Indiana and meets the woman, well, she's now around 50 years old, washed up, has a young daughter, has trouble keeping a steady job, lives in a trailer, and has a shaky history involving a scumbug of an ex-husband.  Basically, the young mans love is so strong that he makes it his own personal mission to flatter the woman and make her life as heavenly and perfect as possible.  A dedicated desire to radically change her lifestyle.  Of course the issue of a HUGE age difference and significantly different backgrounds makes such a predicament quite tricky, not to mention a fantasy of another kind!

What I love about this movie -and what it does exceptionally well- is show what it's like when young men respond to the women they find extremely attractive.  It's awkward, it leads to immature reactions, and it's just bizarre and nothing like the imagination believes it's cracked up to be.  You see, this boy has seen this woman in several naked photo shoots and even built a really nice collection of photos in an organized and neatly presented way inside a photo album, so he's past the point of thinking about this girl sexually- he's now ready to *be* a permanent part of this womans life.

It may seem really creepy to fantasize about a porn star to such an extent, but as a guy who can relate to the male character in this movie, I have to admit I feel the same way about the women I find extremely beautiful.  The girls I've seen in photos, as embarrassing and shameful as it probably is to admit (but this is the internet so why not?) I have to be honest here- I too think about what it'd be like to simply love and care for porn stars.  Seriously.  After all the sex and naked pictures you see these women participate in, you eventually desire to see them in a new light.  You also realize that they're being used for sexual reasons and that it's not right.  You want to appreciate them as people.  This is exactly what this young man is trying to do, so I can relate to him.  In one instance he even brings the woman her young daughter from school since, due to a custody battle, the father is responsible for the girl which means any time spent with the daughter is limited and considered precious for the mother.

Of course the porn star doesn't understand any of the teens behavior, and the fact he's weird doesn't help matters either.  She's understandably reluctant to get close to the boy since she's been used so many times and for so many years by several men looking for one thing and one thing only (and it's not love) she simply *can't* open up her feelings and trust him.  She assumes the young man is either going to get up one day and suddenly leave (because her experience up to this point leads her to believe men can't be trusted) or that, since the boy has so many naked photos of the porn actress, that he's only planning on using her for sex and just picking the right opportunity to do so.

The movie writers do a wonderful job with the storytelling here since it captures the awkwardness of a porn star and a young, inexperienced teen trying to find an appropriate way to figure out a relationship.  I actually think whoever came up with such a storyline must have been through their own set of circumstances involving fantasizing about an attractive naked woman to the point of wanting to share their life with them, and used this movie as an outlet to express such a fantasy.  If so, very clever (and relatable for many young men).

Oh well, since I can relate to the main character I really don't think such a storyline is as creepy as many ordinary everyday folks probably would, but I really admire a creative, original and well-written storyline such as this one.  I was craving something different tonight, and got it with Meet Monica Velour.  A highly recommended movie for all teens and adults too.",1344384000,,4720,4.5017584994138335

4526618,3,B0051ZIXJO,"Adolescence is a period of barely controlled insanity. Adulthood isn't much better. ""Meet Monica Velour"" proves it!

Kim Cattrall (""Sex and the City"" and ""The Ghost Writer"") is the infamous Monica, a talent-less former porn star gone to seed. Her main fan is a gawky 17-year-old boy from Auburn, Washington, who has collected all her videos, posters, press clippings and publicity items from websites, video stores, yard sales and E-Bay. This goofy kid is played to geeky perfection by Dustin Ingram (lots of TV) whose character is out to prove that love IS blind!

Our hero is the proprietor of a mobile hot-dog vending van; it has a giant hot dog mounted on the roof. His father is a boozy retiree, played by Brian Dennehy (working hard on stage and screen since 1977), who gives his son the keys to the van as a high-school graduation present. The boy instantly lists it on E-Bay and finds a buyer in the mid-West, not too far from the last known address of his dream girl.

Off he goes and our story begins....

This 2010 Seattle International Film Festival entry is well written and capably directed by Keith Bearden. Cattrall certainly is not afraid to depict a less-than-admirable character and our hero perfectly illustrates the nuttiness of adolescence. (But everyone's teeth are too white; they look fake.)

4526619,3,B0051ZIXJO,"I watched this film a while back. It bothered me for a few days after watching it. It stayed with me, I'm not quite sure if in a good way or a bad way, but it did. The longer I thought about it though, the more I thought that this was perhaps the best thing Kim Catrall has ever done.

Tobe (Dustin Ingram) is a teenager about to graduate from high school. With no friends except for the next door neighbor kid, he's a loner, running the hot dog wagon his grandfather (Brian Dennehy) has him work or spending time in his room watching ""classic"" porn films that star his favorite actress, Monica Velour (Catrall). Determined not to spend his days selling wieners after his grandfather gives him the truck for graduation, he decides to sell it online.

Fortune smiles on young Tobe has a buyer offers to take the weiny wagon off his hands. Better yet, the town this buyer lives in is going to have a personal appearance by Monica Velour at a local strip joint. Anxious to meet his celluloid heroine, Dustin hits the road. The first stop is the strip joint where he's chatted up by a floozy who works there while waiting for Monica.

When Monica hits the stage she's different but not in Tobe's eyes. Instead of the young starlet, Monica has passed over the 40 year mark, gained a few pounds and is not the image seen on the small screen. Some punks in the club make a few comments about her looks which inspire Tobe to defend her. The result is his being beaten up, having his wagon spray painted and Monica losing this small gig.

Monica takes Tobe home with her to mend him up. Her location leaves less to be desired, a mobile home that's seen better days. Drunk and beaten, Tobe falls asleep and she allows him to stay.

What follows is a bittersweet love story of sorts with Tobe fulfilling his life long dream of meeting a woman he thinks of as the epitome of all things female. Unfortunately Monica isn't the least bit interested in Tobe. And she is far from perfect, instead having a drug habit and being in the midst of a custody battle for her daughter, a little girl who means the world to her but who her ex uses as a tool to extract anything he can from Monica.

Along the way Tobe gets a few words of wisdom from the man who wants to by the wagon, an artist named Claude (Keith David). This is someone who has seen the world and the good things it has to offer. Tobe misinterprets the advice he receives but in the end it works out for the best.

The film definitely qualifies as quirky but it has a heart in its center, even though the main character is a faded porn star. The life lessons learned not just by Tobe but by Monica as well make this story interesting but heartrending at the same time. We're offered a world where dreams don't come true, where bad guys win the big prize and where very little good happens.

A happy ending does finalize the film but it feels like ZAP it's there and all's well that ends well. The problem is while we've spent 90 minutes discovering how bad things can be, turning them around in the last 8 just leaves you feeling spent.

The best thing about this movie though is Catrall. She's made better movies in the past, early in her career with TRIBUTE and later hit stardom with SEX AND THE CITY. But here she gets the chance to show a deeper character than she's usually allowed. And Monica Velour is not someone you're likely to forget. It won't gain her the notice of the Oscar committee, but fans should make a point to see her in this film.",1332201600,,3496,4.317073170731708

Tobe, the ""dateless wonder"" adores adult film star, Monica Velour from the 80's.  He is a collector of her bodies of work and even keeps a scrap book of all her movies and photos.

Upon graduating high school, his grandfather gives him the family ""Weenie Mobile"" a food truck that sells what else but hot dogs complete with a giant weenie on the roof of the vehicle.  Tobe decides to sell it and places an ad online.  He receives an offer from a man in Indiana and since he lives in Washington didn't want to drive all the way out to Indiana until he notices that Monica Velour is making a guest appearence in some club also in Indiana. The trip to Indiana is on.

Time and hard living, life has not been kind to Monica who is played by an almost unrecognizeable Kim Cattrell and she is superb.  The other actors are terrific too.

4526621,4,B0051ZIXJO,"I'll be the first to say that when I review, I tend to make better music reviews than the movie ones. I'm a lot more passionate about music than I am with movies because music fills a huge void that life otherwise often provides. However, when I see a movie like this, I have to say something even if my words don't add up to much. OK. Onto the review.

Monica Velour is an adult film star. The main character has an obsession with her and her old porn movies and when the chance to escape his everyday mundane life to actually meet her comes, a spark ignites and he jumps for joy at the opportunity. All he takes with him is his hot dog truck, a wallet full of cash and a backback of sorts with random odds and ends inside.

From the first time he sees her on stage at the stripping place she currently works, he is entranced. She is all he's dreamed of and more. He ends up getting beat up really badly by defending her because of her now being middle aged, and she ends up taking him home to recover. He eventually finds out that she has an every day life like everyone else and problems too. In between all of this, he makes her breakfast, attempts to bring her flowers and does something really special for her on their first week anniversary of meeting (which I don't wanna spoil here).

I'm still watching the movie (although it's more than halfway over) and I have to say that the main characters (mainly the male lead and Kim Cattrall as Monica) make the movie so very real and relatable. Yes, there are some scenes with nudity but I love the whole ""dork"" on a road trip alone thing. I actually don't look at him as a dork, but moreso as someone much more relatable and kinda like myself more than anything. But to get to my point: some nudity but more importantly a movie about characters you will feel for more than on one occasion. You will feel like you yourself have either been in their shoes before or that you aren't so unlike them in one way or another.

OK. This review has gone on so long and I feel I haven't said exactly what I wanted. I'm gonna end it here and hope that you give it a shot. At the start and for a while, it seems like the movie is hopeless. It feels very cheesy at first. But I tell you it gets better.

Ingram, learning that Monica (Cattrall) will be appearing at a strip club in rural Indiana, decides to drive there from his home in Auburn, Washington, and see his ""goddess"" in person.

In fact, the only reason I did is because I watched an old Graham Norton interview with lead actress Kim Cattrall on YouTube in which she talked about the film. I liked what she said about the script and how much she enjoyed getting the opportunity to play a character who is anything but glamorous so I took a chance.
(I have to admit here that my normal taste in films runs to mysteries, science fiction, and the occasional western so a movie about a gawky teenager falling in love with an aging former porn star is really way outside my comfort zone.)
Cattrall, as the titular character, gives a really terrific performance as the former porn star who, nearly broke, is forced to take a temporary job stripping in a seedy club in a small Indiana town. Half a country away, new high school graduate - and Monica Velour fan - Tobe Hulbert discovers that she is scheduled to appear in the club and drives a food truck (with a gigantic hot dog on the roof) to see her. What follows is a bittersweet, if somewhat unusual, coming-of-age story. I won't go any further in discussing the plot because I don't want to spoil the film for those that have not yet seen it. I will say that there are some truly poignant scenes in the movie as the two main characters struggle to make sense out of their lives.
Dustin Ingram, as Tobe, is well cast as the geeky, awkward teenage boy who doesn't date but, instead, has apparently dedicated his life to collecting all of the old Monica Velour films and memorabilia he can. Veteran actor Brian Dennehy has a few nice scenes as Tobe's cranky grandfather while Keith David gives a nicely nuanced performance as an artist who befriends the teen and offers him some advice when he most needs it.
Cattrall, who made her reputation as a confident beauty on screen and on television, appears without make-up and gained more than a few pounds to play the lead role. She's not DeNiro in ""Raging Bull"" but she demonstrates that she has much greater depth as an actress than she is usually given credit for.
One word of caution: This movie may make some viewers uncomfortable because there are some simulated sex scenes that are more suggestive than explicit. These scenes are not gratuitous, however, and do help to move the story along.
Pleasantly surprised by the script and the very good performances of Cattrall and Co. I give it five stars.",1493424000,2,2443,4.567198177676538

This is a fairly straightforward story.  It involves the growing-up of a geeky kid named Toby, played by Dustin Ingram.  Toby is reminiscent of Napoleon Dynamite but actually looks even more geeky than Napoleon.  The other major character is Monica Velour, played by Kim Cattrall.  Supporting male actor Brian Dennehy plays Tobys grandfather and supporting female Jee Young Han plays Amanda, a classmate who actually seems to like Toby.

Toby is too shy to attempt dating but has a fixation on an adult film star with the trade name Monica Velour.  He owns copies of all her movies.  She aged out of the business some years ago.  Circumstances conspire to allow Toby an across-country trip to actually look her up and attempt to meet her in person, which hhe does.  This is a brave performance for Kim Cattrall as she has to look unglamorous, and her character has a sad and failed life that one might imagine for some of the women who start out in this industry with hopes of becoming a mainstream star.

Naturally, this being a Hollywood movie, Kims character has to help ease Toby away from adolescent fantasy and into a life of real-world relationships with someone who is age-appropriate, while Toby tries to rescue Monica from her own messes.  The ending is in part idealized and unrealistic but hey-without a Hollywood ending, how could it be a Hollywood movie?  This film manages to be funny at times, serious at times, without ever sinking into maudlin or outright depressing.",1467763200,,1534,4.805343511450381
