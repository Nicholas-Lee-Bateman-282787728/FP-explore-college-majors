I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in knowing more about the Catholic faith, who's not into discrediting a faith based on ignorant prejudice or what we've heard from others.",1386806400,,344,5.254545454545455
8299505,5,B001ETK1LY,"This video was informative, inspirational and it very much touched my heart.  It is easy to understand and very thought provoking.  Deacon Jones makes you think of the importance of your faith, why you practice that faith and why you should continue to pursue the Word of God.  He helps you to realize that it is o.k. to practice a faith that is often misunderstood.  I have peace and motivation after watching his story.  He is such a great speaker!  I want that fire that Deacon Jones has.",1377734400,,491,4.5227272727272725
