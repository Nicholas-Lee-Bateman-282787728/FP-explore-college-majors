3650050,2,B001IXXYCE,"I bought this directly from Amazon -- not one of the Marketplace sellers. So presumably it was authentic. Season one played fine.

However, when I put in the disc for season 2 -- though the sound of the Paramount swish was quite audible --- there was ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND ON ANY OF THE EPISODES ON ANY OF THE DISCS IN SEASON 2.

When I opened the package I noticed the box was quite warn at the corners. This was obviously a return or used Season 2 because it was defective. And it wasn't the DVD itself -- it was the imprinting of the episodes.

I called Amazon immediately -- and they are sending out a whole new set -- exactly the kind of customer service I expect from Amazon -- but seriously -- what is the quality control here?

I've bought nearly a dozen series in the last several months, particularly if their sale price went way down. I wanted to build up a collection of my favorites. I only bought sets from Amazon directly (as I always do) because I don't trust 3 party martket place sellers here. I've been burned too many times.

I don't have time to listen to all the sets all the way through. I have a life! I expect better quality control than this.

Shame on Paramount for putting out such garbage or Amazon's buyer for purchasing used goods.

Makes me wary of buying any more DVDs -- Fortunately, there are not many more I want.",1274486400,28,1347,4.321428571428571
3650051,5,B001IXXYCE,"CHEERS... my all-time favorite television show. Without question without peer. This show started off at the bottom and quickly endeared itself to the nation until it reached the number one slot on television.

Carla (Rhea Perlman) is the only actor who is less than stellar, but her character is so overwrought with zaniness that the acting matters not. Cliff (John Ratzenberger) created himself into one of the most well-known and well-spoofed of characters in television lore. Is it a coincidence that the demise of our U.S. Postal Service was inversely proportional to the increased popularity of this brainless two legged barstool? Norm (George Wendt)... got himself typecast into such a beloved role for which the actor would never wish to live down. (MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's own Al Bundy cannot compare to the character recognition of Mr. Wendt's ""Norm (Norman) Peterson."" Woodrow Tiberias Boyd (Ole ""Woodhead"" Woody Harrelson himself) and Coach (Nick Colasanto) complete the ensemble cast that (along with the leads of Sam Malone (Ted Danson), Diane ""Don't you think if I could have sent her to prison I would have"" Chambers (Shelley Long) and Rebecca (Backseat Becky/ Beck Beck as played by Kirstey Alley) gave life to a television show rarely matched before or since in comedic genius with heartwarming tenderness.

Just watching George Wendt agrily chasing Cliff Clavin around the bar after having just been released from jail is worth the cost of this set. One needs only to watch a few episodes to recognize the genuine comradery that exists among most of the cast members (including the episode where in several spit balls are seen in Woody Harrelsons hair complements of George Wendts off-camera shenannigans.)

This show remains nearly timeless with humor that holds up to modernity and maturity. Some writing gaffes occurred through the 11 seasons but none as egregious as those found on such notable NBC hit shows as FRIENDS and SEINFELD.

CHEERS is truly MUST SEE TV.

I only wish that there were bonus features to be found after the second season. The cast members were notorious practical jokers... such footage alone would be wonderful.",1271894400,35,2157,5.133903133903134
3650052,4,B001IXXYCE,I bought this for a gift.

3650083,5,B001IXXYCE,"This is a show that starts off rocky and gets better. The part I didn't like: the male characters spend 90% of the time slobbering over women, talking about sex, and treating women like objects. The main character, Sam Malone, is a womanizer and prides himself on how many women he can conquer. The other main character, Diane Chambers, is the most obnoxious person I've ever seen in a sitcom. She's a pretentious waitress who thinks she's better than everyone else. She never shuts up and likes to use big words to sound more important.

Now for the good parts. Despite Sam's womanizing, he's a great guy and former professional baseball player. The conflict between him and Diane is funny because she exasperates him.

Carla, the waitress, loathes Diane and has great zingers for her and the lazy guys who hang out at the bar. She's pretty much a hound herself when it comes to pursuing men. She gets pregnant at the drop of a hat, and her kids are juvenile delinquents. Scenes when her scuzzy ex-husband comes to the bar are some of the best episodes.

The series gets better as it goes along and introduces new characters, like Dr. Frasier Crane, a psychiatrist who needs as much help as his patients. There's
Rebecca Howe, who wants nothing more than to marry rich. She embarrasses herself by falling all over wealthy men. Then she gets sloppy when it doesn't work out, which is often. I'm talking about drinking, crying, smoking, not changing her clothes, and ignoring personal hygiene. It's hilarious.

The main characters include Cliff Clavin, the mailman who takes so much pride in his uniform and his job you'd think he was in the military. He hangs out at the bar regaling everyone with stupid trivia. Norm Peterson, is Cliff's best friend and resident alcoholic, who practically lives at the bar, complains about his wife, and is always trying to get free beer. He and Cliff get into all kinds of trouble because they're goofballs with dumb ideas.

Woody Harrelson plays Woody Boyd, a goofy country bumpkin who comes to Boston to fulfill his dream as a bartender. His stories about Hanover, Indiana, give you the impression everyone who lives there married their first cousins.

You also get to enjoy cameos of acters and actresses who appeared on the show before they became famous. Towards the end you'll come to love the characters, except for Diane. (I never stopped hating her.) This series had one of the best final episodes I've ever seen. I didn't cry, but definitely felt misty-eyed.",1494720000,,2504,4.784722222222222

3650096,5,B001IXXYCE,"Relive one of the best series on TV. 45 awesome discs covering every episode seasons 1 to 11 (labeled as the Final Season).  For me, I had missed the Shelly Long (Diane) years and all the famous ""extras"" on practically every episode.  Almost every disc in Seasons 1-6 is loaded with additional ""Special Features"" such as conversations with the actors, gag reels, behind the scenes, making of and other extras.
The packaging:  Comes in two hard plastic cases with the discs in library style cd storage (see picture). The inner case is not attached to the outer plastic case. On the inside of both cases is the listing of each season, disc and episode.  One minor (brief temporary hissy fit...Opened Seasons 1-6 case and pulled out what should have been season 1 disc 1 to immediately watch and realized I was watching season 8 disc 4.  All the discs were in the wrong cases...none of them were in the correct case, they were all mixed up. Had to pull out all of them and properly order.  Minor irritant but popcorn and wine while sorting eased the pain).
The discs:  Excellent quality recording,sound and clarity.  There were no inaudible or excessively loud discs. Some of the early discs you had to select each episode, but for some reason later in the season the option to ""Play All"" was included.

3650101,4,B001IXXYCE,"I used to like this show a lot 'back in the day'.  It was witty, whimsical, and humorous without being overbearing.  The different personalities (Sam, Diane, Cliff, Norm, Carla, Coach/Woody) were depicted in quick artistic brushstrokes without becoming cardboard-y.  What prevented the show (for me) from gaining the last (5th) star was the change that introduced Frazier, the Kirstie Alley character, and Frazier's girlfriend.  Those characters and the script changes attempting to make the show 'edgier' only served to lose the show its 'gentleness' I'd appreciated earlier.  Still and all, I like the show, its concept and the mostly uplifting sense it brings that life is best handled with frequent laughter and generous grains of salt.",1483142400,,740,5.344827586206897

The show went downhill fast after the departure of Shelley Long. It's a poorly and immaturely-written one-trick pony, relying on the same plot episode after episode with Danson trying to get into pants and sophomoric sexual innuendo that got real old. Boring. Not clever in the least.

We were both bored but kept watching because when you pay almost $70.00 you think there might be at least something redeemable. It baffles me that this was so highly-rated, but then there is no accounting for the taste of the average American. I am glad I missed it first-run.",1459987200,,746,4.730769230769231

3650144,4,B001IXXYCE,Cheers is a show I can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. It's rare to have a cast as solid as this show had. This beloved series is worth every penny. The only reason I can't give the set 5 stars is the lack of any dvd special features beyond the first season. The first season has some cool extras but the remaining seasons of this set are bare bones.,1453075200,,369,3.933333333333333

3650146,1,B001IXXYCE,"It had been about 25 years since I'd watched cheers, and I really thought it was better.  I thought it was a little more entertaining, like Frasier maybe.  It struck me just how much they loved pushing the dirty jokes.  I guess when I was in junior high, and high school I thought locker room humor was cute, but...  Some of the characters are fun, but I wish I'd just remembered that I liked it (rather than find out how easy a dirty joke went over when I was 12).  If you DO like cheers, I would wait until they put ""PLAY ALL"" on all the seasons.  About 1/3 of the seasons are inconvenient to watch.  Boy, does this sound negative!

3650156,5,B001IXXYCE,Later in the initial run of the series on TV I became a fan of the show.  Reruns allowed me to catch up and start from the beginning with the entire group at the bar.

Recently I bought the complete series and have started from the beginning when Diane first arrives at the bar.

I noticed that the DVD covers were different than the ones referred by the top reviewers (two big convenient plastic cases as the Frasier complete set I purchased before). I wrote Amazon about this fact, they replied promptly, as usual, informing that a new set will be shipped at no cost, no need to return the product due to the complications involved. Good, some days later I received EXACTLY the same product (8 plastic cases, not the 2 big ones I referred to). I have been an Amazon satisfied customer for about 20 years.

Needless to say, I didn't run through it again with these DVDs, but Cheers is an instant classic and one that holds up very well to this day. The jokes are still relate-able and the characters are lovable from the start.

This complete set is a nice edition to any TV show collection and has done away with the individual season packaging and replaced it with two large DVD cases.",1436745600,,469,4.517647058823529

3650181,5,B001IXXYCE,"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast. ""Cheers"" was one of those series.  Sam ""Mayday"" Malone (Ted Danson) is the charismatic owner of the bar.  He is a former Boston Red Sox relief pitcher and a recovering alcoholic.  Mostly, he is an aging babe hound whose life revolves around chasing and bedding women.  Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) is an over-educated, sophisticated snob who is abandoned by her fianc at Cheers. Without a job or marketable talent, Diane reluctantly becomes a cocktail waitress at Cheers.  The Sam and Diane relationship became the central focus of the show for the first five seasons.  The strength of the show was proved when Diane left, and was replaced by Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley).  Rebecca brought a new dynamic to the series as the bar's manager, and the excellent quality of the episodes continued for the remainder of the series.  Another one of the main characters was the beloved and befuddled Ernie ""Coach"" Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto).  Unfortunately, Nicholas died during the third season.  He was replaced in the fourth season by Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), a nave, befuddled bartender from Indiana.  As the writers explained in one of the bonus features, Woody's character was written as the son of Coach's character.

Rounding out the cast was wisecracking cocktail waitress Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman), barstool-and-beer loving Norm Peterson (George Wendt), know-it-all mailman Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger), psychiatrist in need of therapy Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer), and clinical, cold-as-ice Lilith Sternin-Crane (Bebe Neuwirth).  Such was the popularity of ""Cheers"" that when ""Frasier"" became a TV series, many of the Boston bar's characters made guest appearances.  All 270 ""Cheers"" episodes from Seasons 1-11 are packed onto 45 discs in two separate boxes.  Unlike other box sets I have purchased in the past, there were no defective discs in this box set.  I did notice that the commercial promos for the final season's episodes looked very dark.  Occasionally, brief shots in some episodes also looked very dark, when compared to the rest of the scene.  All of the bonus features, such as profiles of characters, a trivia game, and a blooper reel, are included in the first three seasons.  The last episode of ""Cheers"" was preceded by a pre-game show hosted by Bob Costas.  In addition, it was followed by a special ""Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno, broadcast live from the Bull & Finch Pub in Boston.  Unfortunately, neither of those are included in the box set as bonus features.  In addition, no episodes with commentaries from cast members and/or writers are included.  All in all, despite what it's lacking, its well worth owning this box set for all that it includes - every episode from one of the greatest TV sitcoms of all time!",1434931200,16,2891,5.078389830508475

3650183,5,B001IXXYCE,"Back years ago, when my TV was still connected to the outside world, I used to watch the syndicated reruns of Cheers at 11PM, just as something to watch and wind-down by. It was never my favorite show- but it was always watchable; entertaining; and made ya laugh. In recent years, I'd been hearkening back to memories of watching Cheers, and wishing that I had the series on DVD- but alas! In the past, the price of the series on DVD was just too high to justify. Naturally, when I saw this complete series set offered for under 60 bananas on Amazon, I grabbed it- and I'm glad that I did!

In my opinion, this show's appeal lies in the fact that it can make you laugh out loud quite often; and just transport you to a different world, apart from the current reality- which is what entertainment is supposed to do; but which most modern forms fail to achieve. And while I often don't like clichd story arcs- I have to say that with Cheers, the Sam and Diane romantic story arc was very well done, and even keeps ME interested! And the beauty of it is, instead of concentrating on that one arc, the producers wisely just kept it as one aspect of the show, while giving equal weight to the other characters. Well-done!

And, much like Three's Company, this is also one of those rare shows which is good right from the very beginning. It hits it's stride right off the bat in episode one; and the characters are already fully developed. A rare feat, successfully pulled off only by the real veterans of good TV comedy!

I see some other reviewers complaining about the packaging. Personally, I have no problem with the packaging. It is more than adequate for storage and normal use; the DVDs are easy to access; and my mailman even dropped the box on the ground from his car, while trying to hand it to me while i was on my tractor- and it did it no harm.

All in all, I am very glad that this series is now available in it's entirety for such a low price; and that the packaging is not bulky or gawdy, like some shows which come in novelty packaging!

If you're looking for good old-fashioned entertainment to just sit and watch and relax to at night; which will take your mind off of reality and make you laugh...this is it! (I don't know what it is- even though in real-life i despise bars, and would never patronize one- there is something very comforting about this show!)",1434067200,25,2374,4.386363636363637

With all the negative TV/Shows on the various media's, I can now pop in one of the episodes of Cheer's to get a good laugh. I rate the series Frasier (a spin-off-of-Cheer's), as the best all time sitcom, in my opinion, but either will brighten your day.  I watched about half of the Cheer's series on Netflix, but more than half of the episodes were left out and jumped ahead, leaving much to my curiosity and hunger for the missing episodes.",1433721600,2,611,4.407079646017699

3650189,1,B001IXXYCE,"*PLEASE NOTE: this review and rating applies ONLY to the quality of the item (factory packaging, shipping) - it in no way should be taken as an opinion of the show itself. Cheers is, to put simply, one of the greatest American sitcoms ever created. i was both surprised and excited upon discovering that an official ""complete series"" release was forthcoming (pre ordered nearly a month prior to its' release)

BEWARE: i have had many issues with amazon's shipment and protection of dvd and Blu-ray media. many titles have arrived with punctures in the case, cases smashed in or cracked, loose (horribly scratched) discs and smashed box sets. many items looking as though a couple of employees at the warehouse have played baseball with the item prior to packing it.

again, with this box set i see that the outer box has been damaged (cases pushed in, corners of box crushed) though that is not the worst part of the arrival and unboxing of this new item.

something must be said about the studio's choice of disc storage. the series is housed in two jumbo dvd cases (seasons 1-6 in the first case, 7-11 in the second)

upon removing the cases from the box i have found - cracks in both cases, the insert with artwork slipping out of the case and ripped, slashes in the case on its' side, case spine smashed in. HORRIBLE packaging. all in all, a cheap answer to those who waited for a complete reissue of this series.

the holder for the discs is also completely loose, with only a couple of hard plastic tags (built into the case design) inside the case to hold it all in place.

it is quite enough to go away - to refrain from the purchase of sets such as these - cheap and shameful.

goodbye Boston, for now.",1431388800,15,1711,4.5
3650190,4,B001IXXYCE,"(This review refers to the May, 2015 complete series release, UPC 3242921918).  Let me first address those who submitted pre-release reviews whining about Coach not being on the box cover: He is, on the back cover.  The only regular character left off the box was Lilith.  Alright, with that out of the way, let's talk about the actual product.  You get the entire series in two plastic cases, Seasons 1-6 in box 1 and Seasons 7-11 in box 2. Each box has a plastic latch.  The discs are on digipaks, one in each box, one disc per side.  There should be no problem storing or accessing the DVDs with normal usage.  There's 45 discs total.  The storage space needed is far smaller than the individual seasons or the previous complete series pack, which was just the individual seasons wrapped together.

You get the entire series, one of the greatest series (much less comedies) ever aired.  What you don't get is anything different from the previous 2003-2009 season releases in terms of restoration or other work.  Everything on the respective season discs is exactly the same as in the previous DVD release.  Nothing has changed regarding menus, extras, etc. If you want to know the details for each season, look up that season's reviews on Amazon.  If you have the 2003-2009 individual season releases, there is no need to purchase this compilation unless you want the complete series, or you have the individual seasons but want to economize on space with this packaging.  If you do not have the entire series but want to purchase it, this is the set to get.  The price is far better at this time than the previous Complete Series release (which again was nothing more than the individual seasons bundled together), and the storage footprint is far smaller.

There are extras for seasons 1-3 only.  Seasons 4-11 have no extras, but in exchange you get the ""Play All Episodes"" option missing from seasons 1-3.  The labeling on each disc is gray, with the show logo, season & disc number, and episode titles.  The DVD transfer was pretty good for most episodes.  There are some episodes that came out fairly murky and would need some attention in a future restoration project.  Then there are some episodes so clear you can make out the makeup and lipstick on the actors, especially in the earlier seasons.

Four stars for the show itself, the packaging, and the (current) price.  One star taken off the product for it being a repackaging of existing content with zero additional options, no restoration work, no new extras, instead of a freshly restored & remastered release.",1431129600,99,2577,4.780542986425339
3650191,5,B001IXXYCE,May be the greatest comedy ever. Does anyone know how this set differs from the previous 2009 release?,1430784000,2,102,4.722222222222222
3650192,5,B001IXXYCE,"THE Greatest Sit-Com Ever Made ?
....YES ! Cheers had good-natured people who were good to know. Even Carla was at heart, a 'softie' when it came right down to it.
Better than Seinfeld...?
.... YES ! Cheers featured likeable characters that you would want to be around--Seinfeld`s crew were basically selfish, self-absorbed egos who whined constantly. The final episode established that Jerry & crew were really just not good people. Kramer was the least objectionable--but he was nuts.
Better than Friends... ?
.... YES ! Those Friends were a tight-nit group and were only 'there' for each other. At Cheers, 'everybody knew your name, and was always glad you came'.
Better than How I Met Your Mother...?
... YES ! While Ted and his pals from college were good people, the only outside people they seemed to want to include in 'the gang' was Robin and Barney.... It`s the Friends exclusionary attitude all over again.
Better than M*A*S*H .... ?
...YES ! ...But it`s a trick question--MASH was not only a Sit-Com, MASH was THE  greatest tv series--EVER. (Why? Because MASH did it all from Comedy to Drama to Message Statement--MASH could be light-hearted slapstick, or provocative drama.

Anyway, if this complete set  of CHEERS has the same A/V quality as the individual releases, (which I own) then this is a wonderful bargain at the price, and well-worth every dime. So head on  over to Cheers, and you`ll have a great place to hang-out for as much binge-watching as you care to put in. Last time we watched Cheers, my wife and I would 'go there' for an entire evenings` viewing once a week)..

3650209,5,B001IXXYCE,"This ""Cheers"" collection is 11 seasons of comedic genius!  There are few series where the characters are so well developed that they continue to grow and evolve, becoming more interesting with each passing year. I cannot begin to express how wonderful it is to watch these episodes again. They are 25 minutes of pure gold!  It stands the test of time and will always set the standard for true comedy.

One must not forget it was ""Cheers"" that gave birth to the character of Frasier, making this series a prerequisite to truly understanding all facets of ""Frasier"" and its 11 season run... The added bonus, we get to catch up with our favorite ""Cheers"" characters as well!

Set observations:  My Seasons 1 through 3  DO NOT have the ""play all"" feature.  I'm not sure if this is true for all seasons 1-3.  Two of the DVD set sleeves were a bit worn from what I assume was excessive handling over time and the last season's case was cracked in a few places.  I again assume rough handling. All discs are perfect. -- However, I can't complain too much since I did snag the set for $80... For that amount of money, it's tolerable, but that's just my opinion.

Enjoy the collection!  :)",1418342400,,1180,4.518867924528302

The character of Sam Malone is iconic as a womanizing ex-drunk who stays sober inspite of being a bartender.

Cliff is just a funny annoyance most of the time but is also someone who will show up in crunch time. Frazier Crane is a conflicted shrink with delusions of being a ladies man.

3650267,4,B001IXXYCE,"I watched Cheers religiously when it first came out in 1982.  It was on TV when I got married, when our kids were born, and when they went off to school. On re-watching the series, I've gotten a chance to see many episodes that I missed the first time around.

The comedy is some of the greatest ever written or acted.  To add to this, each episode has multiple components.  First, before the intro credits, is a one-minute skit.  This is followed after the intro commercials with the main body of the show, which has a main plot and usually one or more secondary plots, giving the show a great complexity that you don't find in most sitcoms.

For me, Seasons 1 through 4 are are the best.  Season 5 has some over-reaching piling-on on Dianne (Shelley Long), especially by Sam (Ted Danson).  The last episode of Season 5, which shows a ""what could have been"" scene between Sam and Dianne 30 years later had they been married, is by far the saddest sitcom episode that I've ever watched. Seasons 6 through 11, with Rebecca instead of Diane, are great also.

This is my brief take on the characters.  Ted Danson as Sam - the first season is his best. The director must have asked him to start playing a more stereotypical dumb jock starting in Season 2, which was too bad because he is a very good actor.  Dianne is played beautifully by Shelley Long. Norm is funny but a bit one dimensional.  Cliff is great - perhaps the most underrated character. Carla is great although sometimes too repetitively obnoxious to Dianne.  Frazier is great, as is Lilith.  Coach and Woody are both great. Rebecca is very good but can sometimes be a bit annoying.

One issue that I had is that the characters don't develop or evolve much - for the most part -over the course of the show.  Nobody has kids (except Carla who has too many, and Frazier).  Nobody gets married (except for Frazier and Woody). Most characters are in the same situation at the end of Season 11 as they were at the beginning of their first season.  The final mega-episode of Season 11 is extremely sad - with Sam and Dianne almost getting back together as Shelley Long makes a return appearance.  Personally, I was pulling for them to reunite.

Overall, this Complete Series was very well put together with interviews for each season. It includes every episode ever done, all 275.

There is some really great comedy here, some of the absolute best ever done.  The fact that this level of performance was sustained over 11 seasons is amazing.  If you take this series one episode at a time, almost all episodes are 5 stars, and none are below 4 starts.  I took one star off for the series as a whole, bringing it down to 4 stars, because of the humor sometimes getting a bit nasty for my taste, and also because Sam and Diane never get back together again, neither and the end of Season 5, or at the end of Season 11.  Of course, if Sam and Diane had gotten together at the end of Season 5, Seasons 6 through 11 might never have occured.  But getting together at the end of Season 11 would have been ""high art"".  I realize that's just my personal preference on these points, and it doesn't take away from my overall enjoyment of this remarkable show.",1333411200,10,3204,4.4604810996563575
3650268,5,B001IXXYCE,"CHEERS-THE COMPLETE SERIES: An undisputed ""top shelf"" ensemble sitcom, Boston based watering hole CHEERS was the place ""where everybody knew your name""...especially if it happened to be NORM...but amazingly, no one ever seemed to smoke or play the jukebox.

The only thing I didn't like about the DVD set is that you are forced to watch previews for other shows before you have access to the Cheers episodes menu. I don't think this is right considering the cost of the DVDs.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheers-Seasons-1-11/dp/B001IXXYCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheers - Seasons 1-11</a>",1307836800,29,621,5.336734693877551
3650273,5,B001IXXYCE,"My husband and I have watched this series through twice now, and it makes us long for the days when television was about lovable characters, rubbing up against each other making us laugh in ways that we just don't get with more recent shows, that seem to delight in put-downs instead of good writing.  And don't even get me started on ""Reality T.V."" where humiliation is the name of the game, and if someone isn't having an emotional breakdown, it's just not entertaining.

Cheers, if you haven't seen it yet, is about a lovable, alcoholic bartender, Sam Malone, who drinks himself out of a job, and a marriage, and ends up buying a bar.  His regulars include an accountant, Norm, who bemoans the fact that he has no life, yet his life is Cheers and his family is Sam,and the other patrons.  What's so charming about Norm is that everyone yells out 'Norm' when he walks into the bar, and when someone asks him how he'd doing, Norm always has a witty comeback, such as: ""how's life treating you?"" and Norm answers, ""it's a dog-eat-dog world, and I'm wearing milk bone underwear"".

Next is Cliff, the mail man who sits next to Norm.  You just had to know that the writers came up with the name Cliff because Cliff knows a little something about everything, he's literally a Cliff Note, and will drone on and on until someone tells him to be quiet.

Then there's Karla, an Italian spit-fire, and single mother of six kids, who has a biting comeback for most everyone, but especially Cliff and Diane the other waitresses.  Karla is half in love with Sam, so she resents Diane who is constantly leading Sam on and then shutting him down.

And then there's Diane.  The bane of Sam's existence.  Sam, who possesses a black book of babes numbers that is sacred to Cliff and Norm, who live vicariously through Sam's exploits.  Sam, who is the player extraordinaire, falls for the pseudo intellectual Dianne whose certain her relationship with Sam in a backward step for her, even though her college professor boyfriend left her waiting at Cheers, when he ran off with his ex-wife.  Diane is so neurotic that she can't enjoy anything because she's too busy trying to prove how intelligent she is by quoting authors, poets and following anyone who might have more education than she has which is considerable.

There's a psychiatrist named Frasier, who ended up with a spin-off show called Frasier, who plays a character who's supposed to be a healer, yet as we get to know Frasier, we realize that he's the one who's most in need of a good psychiatrist.  He falls for a fellow psychiatrist named Lilith, and again, the writers have named her after the first wife of Adam who is a she-demon, and Lilith with her pale skin, dark hair and no emotions, fits the part perfectly.

Midway through the series, Diane is replaced by Rebbecca, and the first time Rebbecca comes through the door Sam is so flustered, he bursts out with ""she's almost as good looking as I am"".  Priceless.  Rebbecca is Sam in female form, and just as neurotic as Diane was.

I can't recommend this series highly enough.  It's like a visit to your dysfunctional, yet warm and loving family where everyone supports each other through the good and the bad times.  It's funny in a good way, because the characters are well-drawn to the point of being real enough to feel like you could meet them one day on the street.  Sam, who is the focal point of the show is warm and loving, and really the father figure to the rest of the family, who look to him for guidance.  Sam plays the 'wounded hero' who tries to heal his family as best he can, giving the show an undercurrent of emotion that makes us feel good watching it.

3650274,4,B001IXXYCE,"We have been watching and enjoying the entire Cheers series on DVD. We are into Season 8 now. Some of the shows for Season 7 were out of sequence and did not belong in Season 7. Whoever put these shows on DVD didn't get their sequence research correct.

The video quality is adequate, but not 16:9 aspect ratio, 720p.

Some of the video quality on these DVD disks is marginal in places, so if you're expecting great quality you will be disappointed. We weren't expecting anything more than standard quality so we are not complaining.

There may be a day in the future when all shows will be converted to HD, but the Cheers and Frasier series are not currently available in anything more than standard quality. Still, using an up-converting DVD player and an HDMI cable attached to our HD Sony TV, these shows look great.",1300924800,3,820,4.5646258503401365
3650275,4,B001IXXYCE,"I ordered this product for Christmas. All 11 seasons were shrink wrapped together and each individual season was shrink wrapped except season 1. It was obvious season 1 was a used dvd and disc 4 was missing. Thanks amazon for sending me a used product with a disc missing when I purchased a new item. In requesting a return of this product, I e-mailed amazon asking if I was to send back just season 1 or the entire purchase. That was a week ago and as of yet I have not heard from amazon.",1294099200,5,489,4.212765957446808

8311504,5,B001IXXYCE,"Loved this show when it was on. Always talked about this show with My son who wasn't even born when this series ended whenever we saw one of the regulars in a movie or show. When I received it we intended to watch an episode a day but ended up on a serious binge watch watching all 270 episodes and extras from the 11 seasons in about 3 1/2 weeks. Video and audio look and sound great. No problems with any of the discs. Wanted to buy this for awhile but price was always around 100 dollars, when I saw the price I ordered it immediately.",1525564800,,538,4.084905660377358
