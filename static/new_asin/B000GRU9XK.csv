  The central assertion that terrorists are dangerous and should be treated as such is duly noted and understood by pretty much everybody on both sides of the party divide.  Where the Neo-Conservative message goes wrong, at least in my opinion, is when it decides that the threat of terrorism warrants draconian legislation like the USA Patriot Act, which, however noble in its intent, allows massive and unchecked government intrusion into our lives and strips us of many freedoms rather than creating new ones.

  Ben Franklin himself once said, ""Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."", and it seems to me that the current GOP leadership, or at least the ruling Neo-Conservative wing, has forgotten this simple truth, and have chosen fear-mongering to get their way.

  Much like a school bully who threatens to belt you for not relinquishing your lunch money, the Neo-Cons stand over our broken bodies and shout into our faces ""give up your freedoms or the terrorists win.""  This threat seems more and more empty as time goes on and the facts come in.  When will we stand up to this?  When will their use of 9/11 as a political tool finally be branded as what it is?  Treason!",1164499200,5,1626,4.908424908424909
8134190,5,B000GRU9XK,"This video shows that today's democrats aren't at all like the great Democrats of the past - Roosevelt, Truman and President Kennedy - who led the battles to protect our democracy. Today the de facto spokesmen for the Democrats include Michael Moore (who a German paper called `Germany's favorite anti-American'), and Murtha (who the head of the U.S. military said has hurt both recruiting and troop morale). Democrats always seem to criticize Bush and our troops rather than the terrorists.

This video shows we have to both support our troops and support their mission. Their key mission is to stop terrorists from getting a suitcase-sized nuclear weapon to carry across our borders to attack a U.S. city. This video highlights what the biased press rarely reports. During the Clinton administration there was a nuclear bazaar where the father of the Islamic bomb transferred nuclear technology to many countries including Libya, North Korea, Iraq and Iran. And the only reason terrorists haven't acquired a nuclear bomb since 9/11 is because of the resolute actions of our troops in this worldwide war.

This video also reveals that many narcoterrorists are using drug money to fund attacks against our troops. So give this video to your liberal Democratic friends and encourage them to support both our troops and their mission - just like great Democrats of the past including a great ex-Democrat - Senator Lieberman. And if they're taking drugs encourage them to get help - otherwise as this video says `when that mushroom cloud appears over America, you'll know that you helped fund it'.",1153094400,6,1594,5.080152671755725
