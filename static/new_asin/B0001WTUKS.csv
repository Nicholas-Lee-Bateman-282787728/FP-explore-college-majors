2038264,2,B0001WTUKS,This is standard televison fare.  The interviews are ordinary.  The stock footage is mundane.  And it is not supported with maps and graphics to further explain the sequence of the battle.  This story is not well told.  Read John Tolland's BATTLE: THE STORY OF THE BULGE and you will get a real telling of the Battle of the Bulge.,1278115200,5,330,4.52542372881356
2038265,5,B0001WTUKS,"By far the greatest documentary about the Battle of the Bulge ever created. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Thorough, thoughtful, detailed and exciting. Remarkable archival footage and interviews with veterans of the campaign.",1250899200,14,215,6.2
2038266,5,B0001WTUKS,"This purchase was of a used VHS tape recording.  The item was immaculate, both the tape itself and its box, exactly as adverised.  Delivery (standard shipping) was unexpectedly fast, due largely to the speedy response to my order.",1244505600,,230,5.026315789473684
2038267,5,B0001WTUKS,"If your into World War Two i highly recommend this. I have allot of dvd's and VHS tapes that i bought and taped off the TV and this is second to none. I don't think the Germans would have been able to get a peace or cease fire even if they would have gotten everything they set out to do, they didn't have the planes or oil to carry on the war. Otherwise this is an excellent dvd buy it.",1218240000,6,387,3.85

2038269,4,B0001WTUKS,This show combines interviews with survivors and actual footage.  It shows how US Intelligence was surprised by the Germans in this attack.  It is very clear how the entire operation began and why it ended in victory for the allies.,1207094400,10,232,4.775
2038280,3,B0001WTUKS,"Film was OK for technical quality but I believed content was very biased - In my experience, typical public television editorial historical revision.",1441929600,2,149,5.521739130434782

2038282,5,B0001WTUKS,Had it in VHS and it was playing poorly so I bought the DVD! This is a must have!  Most disturbing is how our Intel and leaders let us down! Wait 'til you here where Ike was and what he was doing! :-(,1436486400,4,200,3.6511627906976742
2038283,5,B0001WTUKS,"This is a must see documentary of one of the greatest battles of WW II. We've toured the Bastonge, Belgium area, visited the museums, and visited several of the battle sites. This DVD helped tie it all together for us.",1435622400,4,218,4.475
2038284,3,B0001WTUKS,"Pretty good documentary although a bit generic. My father was in the 11th Armored Division there at that time and I've read a bit more detailed stories in the past,but this was good. Not fantastic, but good.",1430352000,2,207,4.621621621621622

2038286,4,B0001WTUKS,"This documentary represents an excellent look at the men, the selfless sacrifice and top-level decision-making that made the ""Battle of the Bulge"" what it was, but there is next to no mention of the historic tank battle(s) that were its signature, which is confusing. Not so surprisingly, there is also glaringly no mention of the all-African American 761st Tank Battalion, which fought under Genl. George Patton in the conflict. In fact, there is zero acknowledgment of black soldiers at all, which is a sad commentary.",1421625600,2,520,5.129411764705883
2038287,5,B0001WTUKS,"My father was at Bastogne on December, 16 1944 and lived to tell about it. This is the best depiction of that historic battle.",1420588800,,126,4.291666666666667
2038288,5,B0001WTUKS,Required viewing for all Americans.  Question: Did racism drive Germany's effort for world rule?  Why so? Why not so?,1419033600,,117,5.105263157894737

2038311,5,B0001WTUKS,"Excellent documentary.  Brings home what my Dad went through at Bastone.  He always used this battle as the bench mark for being hungry, cold and tired.",1396915200,3,152,4.8076923076923075
2038312,4,B0001WTUKS,"There was one aspect of this that was not mentioned, that was Skorzeny's troops and their involvement in the battle.",1389139200,2,116,4.85
2038313,2,B0001WTUKS,"This documentary was done from a standard self-criticizing liberal viewpoint, the narration and tone is typically negative towards/about America.  Backhanded comments about leading generals are found throughout the video.

It runs about 90 or so minutes and I would have expected far more focus on the actual battle.  Instead too much time was wasted in three areas:
1) highlighting the failure of American intel to detect the German plan
2) redundant detailing how poorly prepared and equipped the Americans were
3) the over-emphasis and presentation of actual video of American soldiers who had broken down under combat stress (it seemed disrespectful of their sacrifice and obscene to me).

All of the above are completely true, but in comparison to what had actually occurred, not only in Bastogne, but elsewhere, it was imbalanced.

Outside of well known generalities, very little is said about of from the German point of view.  This is a significant flaw.  Surely in the telling of this monumental battle the German point of view, and experience, should have been made known.

I liked the combat veterans interviews, combat footage, and pics.  That's why I gave it too stars.  Perhaps they can be seen elsewhere but I appreciated seeing it here.

Near the end I fast forwarded through the negative-focused claptrap narration.

I don't recommend this video.  There are better materials out there if you want to know about this battle.",1388016000,2,1440,5.128755364806867
2038314,5,B0001WTUKS,This is not a Hollywood movie. This is the real documentary that allows one to feel how our troops must of had to endure in order to spare our lives in America. Great work.,1377388800,4,172,4.088235294117647

2038316,5,B0001WTUKS,Very well done documentary with people who were there.  A lot of correct actual film footage.  To me the Battle of the Bulge rates right up there with D-Day in historical significance.  History is about the people who really did it and what they did.  Have watched this several times since I purchased it.,1349222400,9,305,4.592592592592593
2038317,5,B0001WTUKS,"First rate description of the Battle of the Bulge. Showed the cold, the chaos and how we held up. Two people from my division, the 106th infantry division were  interviewed. Recommend highly",1348963200,7,190,4.9375
2038318,5,B0001WTUKS,"Watching this account of the Battle of the Bulge again filled me with respect for the men and women who fought in the Battle, like my dad who was barely 18 years old.

""quiet sector"", the Ardennes. In less then a month, they were involved in the Battle of the Bulge.
This is one of the best films I have seen on the Bulge.
I would highly recommend it to WWII history fans.",1494633600,2,345,4.0144927536231885
8017439,3,B0001WTUKS,"Okay but a little bit short.  This documentary mentions the Malmedy massacre exactly once.  In that event, December 17, 1944, eighty-four American POWs were machine-gunned down by their German captors.  Just thought it was worth mentioning.",1457913600,3,240,5.611111111111111
8017440,5,B0001WTUKS,"There are so many generic treatments of the 'Battle of the Bulge' that I have encountered in print and film, but this is not one of them!  This film tells the untold story of this misunderstood battle in the true light.  After the first few weeks of the Ardennes Offensive, the Germans had lost their momentum mainly due to congested traffic and poor roads in their rear areas.  The American Army caught off balance began to recover and stiffen their forward lines.  Neither side in the first half of the battle had suffered crippling causalities, the American reinforcements ended any hope of the Germans continuing the offensive.  Hitler's constant interference prolonged the battle, and kept his generals from extracting their divisions in a timely fashion.  Instead, Hitler insisted that his divisions withdraw as he saw fit; also fuel problems kept divisions stranded.  The documentary focuses on the U.S. Army pushing the Germans out of the Ardennes in a brutal slug-fest, advancing a mile a day!  The infantry regiments were quickly depleted, as well as replacements.  It's a heartbreaking experience that explores one of the untold battles of our war in Europe that ranks with 'Huertgen Forest', 'Metz', 'Market Garden', and 'Moeselle Triangle' disasters; some American generals more interested in getting their next star than proper tactics and strategies that would have saved thousands of American lives.  -MB",1457395200,4,1420,5.215859030837004
