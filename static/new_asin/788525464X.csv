7900490,5,788525464X,"I bought this set straight from china...its got Chinese writing on the box, dvds and on the menu...there are 131 episodes on 6 dvds...the picture is crisp and so is the sound...its worth the price...( I paid 2x more when I got mine about 4 years ago)  the only thing is you have to play around a bit on the menu page to figure out how to just play all the episodes one after another, since its all in Chinese...wasn't much of an issue...and you cant find a certain episode unless you can read chinese",1406851200,3,500,4.2631578947368425
7900491,4,788525464X,"These are a gift for my 2 year old granddaughter and perfect for her. It is a clay-mation production and specifically for young children. There is no ""real"" language in this series. Just garbled words.
You need to be very careful when buying this series as most of them are printed in other countries. This just means that the quality can be poor and the dvds might not work in your machine.",1388102400,3,391,4.444444444444445
