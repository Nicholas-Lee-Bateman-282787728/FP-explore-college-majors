8727123,5,B013BB3VQY,"Shorts on Rifftrax fall into two categories.  #1 Valid if poor done.  #2 What the &*^% were they thinking, and don't just blame it on the seventies.  Shorts Assembled has both.  Safety with Animals teaches kids how to know when to back off with animals, while Maintaining Classroom Discipline actually has effective teaching tools (I have a teacher in the family and he swears what they say here works).  Of course the guys riff both of them terribly, but you expect them to.
Then there's Story Telling, with the most horrifying clown in existence, and I say that as a man who actually likes clowns.  Seriously, Steven King's It doesn't hold a candle to this abomination.  I have to assume the people who made this were high, drunk, insane or embalmed.  It's just that bad.  The Clean Club involves small children being bullied by inanimate objects.  The Toymaker might have been about how bad racism or nationalism is, but it's kind of hard to tell.  When the shorts are this weird to begin with, it only gets better when the guys make jokes about them.",1499644800,,1054,4.643243243243243

8727126,4,B013BB3VQY,"I love MST3K and Rifftrax shorts, but this particular collection was subpar overall. Many of the shorts were just boring, and while the riffs themselves were good, the underlying material was neither funny nor weird enough to maintain interest for two hours (I'm looking at you ""Maintaining Classroom Discipline""). Having said that, the shorts that are good are in fact great, and leading that list is the super strange exercise short ""Perc! Pop! Sprinkle!"" in which kid's exercises are analogized to cooking methods in the trippiest way imaginable. (""How would you move like a flour sifter?"") The other gems here are ""Safety With Animals"" which makes you wonder where did all the adults go, and ""The Clean Club"" that's just plain odd.

If you're new to Rifftrax shorts, this is definitely not the collection to start with, but if you are devoted to the cause and especially if you want an intriguing workout, pop this gem in your DVD player and cue up ""Perc! Pop! Sprinkle!""",1473552000,,975,4.873493975903615

8727128,5,B013BB3VQY,"Ten shorts.  Ten reasons to laugh your butt off - and not just because of the riffing - but because these shorts are so bad (well, not as bad as others, but still...).

""Perc Pop Sprinkle"" is bizarre and one one of the best ones on this DVD.  ""Safety With Animals"" is a hoot - where the heck are the adults?  Wow.  You just have to watch it for yourself.  ""The Clean Club"" was written by someone who was stoned.  They had to be.  Some of the stuff is like rejects from PeeWees Playhouse.  A hoot!  And the kids in ""What Makes Things Float?""  They are too stupid to be on the water without adults (will a brick float? Seriously?).

You have to grab this collection and see them for yourself.  A 2 hour laugh-a-thon.",1455926400,2,714,4.2

8727130,5,B013BB3VQY,"How much longer will it be before Legend Films stops releasing RiffTrax DVDs altogether? This, their only new release for 2015, has ten science, health, and safety shorts for children, but the one bona fide classic, ""Story-Telling: Can You Tell it in Order?"", features a terrifying, stentorian clown who dwells in the black void of despair while encouraging kids to take candy from strangers. Nothing else approaches this pinnacle of bat**** insanity, but some come close: ""Maintaining Classroom Discipline"" is about a tyrannical math teacher at war with his students; ""Nutrition"" blames the invention of the automobile for making us eat too many fattening hamburgers (solution: eat slightly less fattening hamburgers); and ""The Toymaker"" stars two hand puppets who invent racism. Truth is, there's not a dull moment in these films from the golden age of talking down to children, so grab it while you can.",1445558400,6,906,5.212328767123288
