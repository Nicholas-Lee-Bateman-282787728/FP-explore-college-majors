3478384,4,B001B16MVS,"Worth the price. This DVD will help me a lot in my career. The only reason it isn't a five, is because of some unsanitary practices that I saw, double dipping, and not wearing full gloves. Other than that, it is a great resource.",1268870400,,229,4.2272727272727275

8281011,5,B001B16MVS,"In my salon, I offer a multitude of services. One of those is leg waxing. When I decided to begin offering Brazilian Bikini waxing, a good friend recommended this video as she had purchased it for personal use. She had only great things to say about it so I gave it a try. I am pleased to say that this video has been an essential training tool for all of my staff at the salon. I made sure that all of my new employees watch this video and we all refer back to it occasionally to reinforce our training.

8281012,5,B001B16MVS,I have worked as a licensed Esthetician for over ten years and recently opened a day spa. I purchased this video to help my employees become better with their Brazilian bikini waxes. This video deals with simple and advanced waxing techniques. Ashley Long is a wonderful instructor and her techniques are top notch. We all learned new techniques and I could not be happier. I recommend this to all in this profession.,1414368000,,417,4.805555555555555
8281013,5,B001B16MVS,"My wife ordered this on my account. She is an Esthetician, and said that there are tips for everyone in here. She seems to have watched it more than just a few times so I guess it was worth it.",1356048000,,193,3.85
8281014,3,B001B16MVS,"I thought this video was well organized and explained some things well. The woman teaching is obviously a wax master and seems like she would be an amazing teacher in person. I was disappointed with the models used in this educational video, they didn't have a lot of hair and the video lacked explaining what to do with those who have coarse hair, loose skin, and what to do in case the wax doesn't come off so easily and slips in the crevasses of the labial fold. I think it is a good video to refer back to for placing wax and directional pulling. If your in desperate need to get a thorough advance educational demonstration (like me) and gain some confidence in the Brazilian waxing, this is not the video. On the other hand, I do recommend this video for your demo library as a reference tool.",1328918400,3,799,4.405405405405405
8281015,2,B001B16MVS,"The spa I work at only uses soft wax. This video says it teaches you using hard and soft wax, but that's not the case. She only applies soft wax on the bikini line. The only real thing I learned from this video is her draping technique.",1299110400,3,236,4.042553191489362
