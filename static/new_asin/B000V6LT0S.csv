8216869,5,B000V6LT0S,"Really fun, with enough variety for all skill levels.
It's a great way to get away from ""normal"" yoga DVD's and just have fun with your practice.",1415491200,,145,4.407407407407407
8216870,5,B000V6LT0S,"I really liked this practice, not only is it a fantastic, somewhat challenging workout it's also completely different than anything I've done before which was the main reason I bought it. Over the years I'm sure most of us have done our share of different Yoga DVDs and after a while they all tend to blend together. YOGA FOR INDIE ROCKERS  is just different enough to stand out yet its also fun, laid-back, unique and with an instructor named Chaos you can be sure of having your butt kicked out of your usual routine.

On the main menu you are given 3 different music options and a forth for instruction only yet despite being Indie rock the music isn't super loud and never distracted me its just a nice change from the new age stuff.

The 40 minute practice begins with Sun Salutations in what appears to be a rehearsal studio complete with stage and instruments (although it could also be a bar) Two of Chaos's students show beginner and intermediate modifications while Chaos leads the rather fast moving session. * For absolute beginners I recommend checking out the ""beginner session"" on the menu page where she explains the basic poses in detail as there isn't complete instruction given during the practice. The rest of the session is as follows;

Balancing series
Warrior series
Frog squats to Ground stretching
Cobra series
Ground stretch
Final meditation

Some of the poses used are; Up and Down Dog, Plank, Half moon, Prayer squats, Standing foreword leg extension, Bow and Arrow, Tree pose, Side lunges, Warrior, Lateral triangle, Side stretch and twist, Frog squats, Bridge, Wheel, Cobra, Full locust Full bow, Camel, Spinal twists and Corpse pose. Namaste.",1266537600,3,1673,4.876760563380282
8216871,2,B000V6LT0S,"I disagree with the reviewers who say Yoga for Indie Rockers is for beginners. I am a total beginner - have taken a couple of classes now and have been reviewing different instructional DVDs. This is pretty much the worst one of the stack.

I appreciate the premise - and that they have created a space for alternative personalities on the yoga scene. Most other DVDs are pretty generic, either a unitard-type outfit scene or a mix of bland people in expensive little exercise outfits.

The problem is that Chaos and her crew go quickly into advanced-seeming, difficult poses. They do have people on the mats at different levels of experience (there is one girl who is ""beginner"" who doesn't do some of the extra bendy things the others do) but for the most part, these are interesting, super flexible people doing these ouch-looking poses right away.  There's not much warm-up, stretching, or introduction to the different poses.

So while I am REALLY glad this DVD exists to inspire indie rockers everywhere, if you're a beginner and not very flexible to begin with, I'd strongly recommend you go to your local public library and borrow a stack of less interesting-looking yoga DVDs to see what style and pace you need.",1263945600,7,1221,4.8
8216872,4,B000V6LT0S,"Great Yoga workout - without the crazy new age music!!
There's 3 different levels (beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) which helps, along with 3 different music options (and a 4th for instruction only). An added bonus after stretching they walk you through a little 5 minute meditation to wrap it up.",1241395200,,296,5.319148936170213
8216873,4,B000V6LT0S,"This is a good basic yoga workout.  It leaves me feeling very well stretched out and relaxed.  It's probably not ideal for a person without previous yoga experience, as she doesn't give a lot of explanation, but I enjoy it.  I appreciate the music as a nice alternative to boring new age synth.  The girls have lots of tattoos and piercings, but they also are very competent at yoga.",1209081600,,383,4.507246376811594
8216874,3,B000V6LT0S,"I was excited to see someone put a spin on my same old yoga classes, and was excited for this to come in the mail. When I got it, though, I realized it's just one simple workout with three alternate music settings. As anyone who uses workout DVDs knows, variety is the spice of life, or boredom ensues.

While Chaos and her friends are entertaining to look at, the workout is VERY basic, and as I said, not very long. I would have loved for this to have more ""meat"" to it. On a good note, the DVD was very good to show a different character for beginners levels, intermediate, and advanced users. So if you're looking for a basic workout with a twist, this one's good. If you need something more, you might have to stick with the same old same old.",1205971200,2,748,4.230769230769231
8216875,4,B000V6LT0S,"It's not a long workout.  It runs about 40 minutes.  The teacher, Chaos, leads three students (beginner, intermediate, advanced) through a good whole body workout.  The techniques are neither extremely complex nor overly difficult, and she moves at a brisk pace.  The balancing series is somewhat challenging, but not to difficult for beginners with patience and drive.

One interesting thing.  You have a choice of multiple music tracks or no music at all.  If you choose the 'no music' option, you just hear the instructor.  If you don't like 'indie rock,' this is a good option.",1205884800,2,581,4.979166666666667
8216876,5,B000V6LT0S,"This is my favorite yoga workout.  The music is excellent, and you have three soundtracks to choose from.  I love the ability to select no music, as well, ""instruction only"", so you can design your own soundtrack.

Music aside, this is a challenging but fun yoga session that has rapidly improved my flexibility, strength and balance.  Chaos is the real deal when it comes to yoga, and I recommend this video to anyone who wants to perform their practice at home.  Raw beginners might want to start out in a yoga class with a ""live"" instructor, because it is hard to learn correct positioning from any video.",1202256000,,608,4.644859813084112
8216877,5,B000V6LT0S,"I have absolutely no experience with yoga and have never used any kind of fitness videos regularly before.  Despite this, I found Yoga for Indie Rockers to be easy to follow.  Chaos talks through all the movements as she performs them, in such a way that even if you're performing a movement where you can't look at the TV screen you still know what you should be doing.  I've gone through the entire session twice now and I don't find any of the poses to be confusing.  There is also a handy beginner's session which goes through the poses she'll be referring to by  name - I recommend working through that once before starting the actual workout.  There are a few poses she'll refer to that aren't in the beginner's session (Wheel, Camel), but you'll be able to follow along.
  The music is actually pretty quiet, so even if you're not into the music choices provided you probably won't find it to be distracting.  In my opinion, it's certainly better than the repeating beats found on most of the exercise clips I watched online before deciding to buy this DVD.
  The entire workout clocks in at around 40 minutes, so it doesn't require a huge time sacrifice to do it every day.  You can also skip around the chapters if you're in a rush and just do the ones you find most beneficial.  Some of the moves have beginning, intermediate, and advanced versions, so while it's possible to go through the entire DVD on your first try, you'll still have to work through it multiple times before you'll perfect all of the movements.
