7911043,1,B00000INCS,"This movie should've been called legend of the drunken director! Who ok'd for this mess to be made? Jackie Chan did it waaay better! The actors who played the heroes got lucky, the action was weak, and even though the storyline was based around an ongoing war the heroes still didn't get the real job done and left everything unfinished! They decided to save themselves instead of saving the whole city! Don't buy, don't rent, don't even use as a reference for a good movie! Stay away from this s#!t!",1247356800,,500,4.566666666666666

It seems pretty obvious that the Drunken Tiger was not the only one hitting the bottle during this production. For one thing,  the bad guys that make up the international army are really silly. They wear goofy cobbled-together uniforms, blonde wigs (think Harpo Marx), run at full-speed instead of marching, and carry flags with them wherever they go; day time, night time, whatever! If you see these guys, they have flags! It's hard to tell if they're part of an army or a parade!
The people making the film try to tell too big a story with too few bad guys (maybe six or seven who actually fight the rebels). And yes, they all know kung fu! Meanwhile, they show maybe upwards of a hundred people in crowd scenes, marching on the Great Wall, fleeing the international army, and appearing in other places, but they leave it to maybe ten people to cleverly combat the six or seven bad guys three or four times.
Up until the takeover, the story is lots of fun, with great fights, and the introduction of the gun into China. Even at the end of the story, the fights are good, but the head bad guy that the Drunken Tiger is after never really gets his hash settled.
This is another one of those kung fu movies that will end on an inexplicable freeze-frame that doesn't resolve the story elements of the occupying force, the bad guy, the rebels, or anything else.
Still, the film is likable, and the drunken training sequence alone is worth the price of the disc. As for the international army, it has great MST3k comedy value for your own MST3k party.",1016928000,,1743,4.515822784810126
7911045,2,B00000INCS,"this movie starts out good but gets dumb fast , one thing is  they needed to leave the white people out what were they thinking then they got Asians dressed like white people. there are a few good points in this movie which is why it didn't get a 1 and you  should see this movie but not necessarily buy it.",973900800,,307,4.016393442622951
7911046,3,B00000INCS,"I was wrong. Chin Kar Lok is not in this film,but the film WAS made in the early 90's. It was part of three video's released at the same time which included Shaolin Avengers(with Chin Kar Lok),and Descendent of Wing  Chun(with Tsui Sui Keung and Lee Hai Sheng).""Descendent"", was the  only film that wasn't made in the 90's,it was made in the late 70's,1979 I  think.",956966400,,366,4.515151515151516
