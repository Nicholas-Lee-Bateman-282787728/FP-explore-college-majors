5414782,1,B00AF4ORUK,"I have seen many movies about illegal immigration but this one is my top pick for its absurd depiction of the topic. I cannot think of one event that happened in the movie that was in the slightest bit an accurate account of what really happens. I understand that its a movie and it needs drama in order to sell, but my god, at least spend an hour doing research to make the plot something less than ridiculous. Sharon Stone really is a ""perra"".",1362355200,4,445,4.309523809523809

Sharon Stone, probably best known for crossing her legs in Basic Instinct, brings some real acting and emotion into Border Run, which by most standards would be considered B-grade.
To its benefit the story is strong enough to raise it up a notch or two.
Sofie Talbert (Stone) is a Phoenix television reporter with right-wing tendencies. In real life, Sharon is more liberal. She is even an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church, so she had to do some acting. Shes working on a story about people crossing the border. Thousands try to cross into the U.S. illegally every year, Sofie says. Each person carries a story, this is one of them and I didn't know at the time but this story is also mine.
She gets deeper into the story, by accident, when she calls her brother (Billy Zane) to tell him about her big break. She hears gunshots over the phone.
So she begins a search for her missing brother. Eventually she finds herself as cargo in a hidden compartment under an 18-wheeler with other hopeful mexicans. Sofie is befriended by a wolf (one who smuggles illegals). One can imagine the conditions - trapped in a compartment, with hot asphalt below, no water and no food. One man dies, so the lead smuggler, a very violent female, discovers Sofie. At first she is going to kill her but then knows her body count will be off by one.
Border Run takes a little while to grab hold, but once is does holds your attention. Do yourself a favor and search out this little film from Anchor Bay Entertainment.",1362009600,4,1576,4.628571428571429
5414784,1,B00AF4ORUK,"One of the worst films I have ever seen. If I was at a movie theatre I would have walked out and demanded my money back. Don't watch unless you want a mixture of boredom, bad acting, and terrible scenes of rape and other brutality. As it is I only watched the first twenty or so minutes because it was terrible and I turned it off.",1361836800,9,331,4.03030303030303
5414785,3,B00AF4ORUK,"I just finished watching the movie.....not bad. But I'm curious to know what part of the movie is based on true events? I've lived in Arizona my whole life and I for the life of me cannot recall any of this in the news.
Was it Sopie Talberts story? I've never heard of her and google turns up nothing on her or her brother. Something like this would have made mass headlines in our so called war torn border (whatever!) Were the names changed?
Or are true events based on coyotes and drug smuggling?
What does inspired by true events mean exactly in this movie? Who's facts? Where? When? And how?
Beats me!",1361491200,9,606,4.371681415929204
5414786,3,B00AF4ORUK,"Sofie (Sharon Stone) is a hard nosed right wing Phoenix reporter. Her brother Aaron (Billy Zane) is on the other side of the fence (literally). He goes missing while helping illegals cross the border. Sofie goes looking for him, utilizing dubious untrustworthy help along the way. She gets caught up in the underground world (again literally) of smuggling. At some point she comes to sympathize with the illegals, but the film really didn't drive that home until she gives a speech to a policeman.

As far as a crime/drama/thriller I didn't feel too thrilled, perhaps because they wanted to take a realistic approach as the film was inspired by true events. Sharon Stone's Botox appearance was distracting throughout. The Mexican police are stereotypical. It is a movie which appears to be designed to create sympathy for the poor immigrants, but falls short. Worthy of a Redbox rental, but don't keep it home for more than a day.

5414787,3,B00AF4ORUK,"""Thousands try to cross into the US illegally every year. Each person carries a story, this is one of them and I didn't know at the time but this story is also mine."" American reporter Sofie (Stone) has just got a big break in the story she is working on. Excited she calls her brother and hears gun shots. Trying to find out what happened leads her to Mexico and a ring of human smuggling and violence. From there things get more and more dangerous, and it's all true. I will start by saying that this was better then I was expecting. While still a B type movie the acting wasn't bad and the movie really made you feel strong emotions. One of them is anger toward the smugglers, the other is anger toward the border guards. To me the movie made me feel mixed emotions. Anger toward the smugglers and anger toward the US policies as well as agreeing with the policies. I wasn't sure who is in the right in this movie and that's what makes a good movie. One that makes you feel something you didn't before. I recommend it for that reason, but the movie itself is just OK. Overall, the emotions you feel make the movie well worth seeing. I say B.",1360627200,4,1144,4.276497695852535

5414794,2,B00AF4ORUK,"In ""Border Run,"" an American TV reporter Sofie sets out to find her brother Aaron who went missing around the US-Mexican border. She believes something bad had happened to him because the last time she heard his voice over the phone, she clearly heard gunshots, too. So she travels to Mexico herself and enlists the help of his co-worker Rafael (Rosemberg Salgado), to discover the truths.

As you expect, the truths have something to do with illegal immigrants. Sharon Stone (who also co-executive-produced) plays the role of the determined reporter with gusto, but with all respect to her it is hard to take her character seriously, when she is seen making out with Rafael BEFORE her brother is found out. Plus, there is more than one incredible coincidence and strange decision making.

But what is really disappointing is that her journey neither convinces nor interests us. No doubt Sofie's search for her brother is intended to serve as a portal through which viewers are allowed to face, as Sofie does, the grim reality of illegal border crossing. The idea is not bad, but the film needs a director who can handle both the thriller elements and the sensitive social issue at the same time more effectively, as Michael Winterbottom did in ""In This World.""

As a missing person thriller ""Border Run"" lacks tension. As a social comment the film (that takes sides, which is fine with me), it needs a more coherent narrative.",1379289600,,1427,4.864197530864198
5414795,1,B00AF4ORUK,"Sooo much over the top exaggeratd acting and unrealistic situations. Plus, Sharon Stone could not have looked worse for this role. I could tell for sure tue movie was super rediculous when the two make out drunk at the bar while the brother is still missing.  Simply terrible.",1376611200,,276,4.75
5414796,1,B00AF4ORUK,"Sharon Stone portrays a stellar female reporter, the proverbial toast of the newsroom. Within a few minutes of this film, she makes minced meat out of an sneaky female politician, thus giving the viewer the sense that Stone is going to play a brilliant and savvy journalist and human being.  Unfortunately that it falls apart when her brother goes missing in Mexico. The police won't help, don't care, so Stone decides to get the job done herself.

Having no idea where to start looking, Stone engages the help of a co-worker. They drive to a random section of the southern border where they encounter a border fence and armed guards. Low-and-behold, Stone sees her brother`s blood-tinged hat dangling from the top of the fence. Lawdy, it's a miracle! Ignoring the guards and their automatic weapons, Stone rushes towards the fence and begins climbing. Despite the hail of bullets unleashed on her and her coworker, Stone retrieves the hat, scurries back down the fence and runs across the sand, ultimately dodging all the bullets. The duo hide behind a small wooden shed that has no earthly purpose for being there other than to shield the stars. Seconds later, after the gunfire has stopped, Stone and her friend shrug and decide it's safe to leave. They walk away from the shed and stroll unmolested back to the car. It's utterly ridiculous.

It goes downhill from there.

The producers should have allowed Stone to play a character her own age. Instead, they plastered her with bright red lip stick, decked her out in a hairdo fit for a high school prom queen, hoping we wouldn't notice a 55-year-old actress who naturally wrinkles and ages like the rest of us. It's grossly distracting, as is Stone's constant shock and bewilderment every time she encounters more drug cartels, human smugglers and violence along the way. I don't even know if she eventually found her brother. I don't care. I stopped watching and found something better to do. You will too.",1376179200,2,1962,4.847761194029851
5414797,4,B00AF4ORUK,Keeps your interest from beginning to end.  I don't think it's for everyone but I was captivated by it and Sharon Stone is always amazing.,1372550400,,138,4.52
5414798,2,B00AF4ORUK,"It truly is sad when a star begins to age and can't seem to accept it. I understand that Hollywood has an obsession with young actors but there are roles out there that should be played by actors and actresses that require them to be themselves and in their age bracket. When they don't they appear foolish and out of touch with reality. Proof of that lies in the number of botched plastic surgeries we fans have to witness that leave them looking nothing like the starts we once knew.

That being said I was truly saddened seeing Sharon Stone insisting on playing a character far younger than her years. She remains an attractive woman but apparently thinks she needs to play younger roles. I'm sorry, it doesn't work and that becomes the focus for some viewers like myself rather than the story unfolding. Make it a weak story that uses clich&eacute; and seems more politically motivated than anything and it doesn't help.

Stone stars as Sofie, a female reporter who is the center of the newsroom, the star journalist. She's an investigative bulldog who wants to discover the bad things in the world and shed journalistic light on them to make things better, a crusader searching for the next big thing. That story is dropped into her lap when her brother goes missing.

Her brother (Billy Zane) was working with relief efforts along the US/Mexican border and involved in the smuggling of Mexicans across that border. Now Sofie insists on going across the border in an attempt to save her brother, story be damned. But as is always the case the story does end up catching her eye as well.

Soon we find Sofie captured by the bad guys and held captive. She's subjected to the poor treatment that the workers who want to cross the border are exposed to. She also discovers that they're not only being smuggled across as workers but as drug mules too. Can she escape and save both the poor people she's imprisoned with as well as her brother? And just who is behind all of the things going on at the crossing?

Before these things could be answered I found myself not caring. This story has been done before and portrayed better. The acting seems run of the mill and not much higher than Lifetime movie quality (sorry Lifetime). I never found myself engaged with anyone involved on screen, cared only about a few characters none of which were leads and in general thought the movie was more motivated by the politics of Hollywood around the immigration issue than in a story about people. News to Hollywood: tell stories about people and stay out of politics. It never comes out well.

For me the worst was as I said from the start, seeing Stone playing a role that should have been played by someone no older than her 30s. Yes, Stone remains an attractive woman but I found it completely hard to believe her as a reporter in the position she was in. At 55 (her real age) the character should have been an anchor by now not doing tough investigative journalism. I'll suspend belief for most films but this was too much.

On the whole the movie wasn't enjoyable, wasn't entertaining and brought nothing new to the table. Thus I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone with the exception of die hard Stone fans who insist on seeing her in anything at all.",1372118400,2,3253,4.588640275387263
5414799,5,B00AF4ORUK,I don't understand why people gave this poor reviews.  It is possible that they truly don't understand the severity of the situation and the desperation that drives people to make them take the risks that they are willing to take to get to this country.  I thought this was a truly great movie.  I was thoroughly engaged from beginning to end.  I think it is an important movie and I bought it and plan to watch it over and over again.  Miguel Rodarte did a fantastic job in this movie.  He is extremely famous in Mexico and I thought he should have gotten more of a mention on the DVD case.,1371513600,6,591,4.2792792792792795

5414802,5,B00AF4ORUK,"I thought this movie was well made with good writing and great acting. Sharon Stone is fantastic, along with the supporting cast. I'm not sure why some have given this film a bad review. It's an action thriller with good social commentary laced into it without being preachy ... it's an action/thriller! It runs on all cylinders as well as providing some insight and also allowing us to really empathize with the Immigrants trying to get into this country - heartfelt.

And to one negative review about Sharon Stone's character - it's one thing to have knowledge about what goes on, it's another thing when you get out of your office, go to a different country and begin to experience it.

Not sure why I didn't see this in the theaters. I believe it got an ""R"" rating (not sure why) but that is usually the kiss of death for a film like this. There is an intense, EXTREMELY well done (technically) scene that implies rape. Actually, the best I've ever seen. And I don't like violence and from the way it was shot I would say this director doesn't either.

It's entertaining and has a social conscious!",1365292800,2,1102,4.555555555555555
