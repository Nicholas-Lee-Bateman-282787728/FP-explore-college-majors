8365577,4,B002DO6P7S,"Over the span of three years, this film documents the heartbreaking stories of young people addicted to black tar heroin as they resort to prostitution, robbery or anything else to get their daily fix.

8365579,5,B002DO6P7S,This was a great DVD to watch. As it was truthful in its portrayal of what heoin can lead to. Also I found it strangely entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone interested on this subject.,1360368000,2,192,4.361111111111111
8365580,3,B002DO6P7S,"I purchased this video because we watched it in class and were going to be tested on it.  It is very old, but the content is still accurate.  Heroin uses and effects (physically, mentally, and the effects on one's lifestyle) will never change.  Will probably be a documentary I will watch again and maybe share with friends.",1288051200,,324,4.649122807017544
8365581,5,B002DO6P7S,"This is a disturbing but realistic documentary of what heroin will do to people. It takes away family, friends and sanity.

What is truly amazing is that anyone has the fortitude to walk away from this horrid addiction. It's not only the drug, but a lifestyle which is degrading to a person's very humanity. I recommend this documentary to any young person who thinks that using drugs is cool..it's not.",1286150400,2,403,4.757142857142857
