4469477,4,B004UMV3P0,"Great series!  There were a few gliches with the DVD's...pausing in a couple spots.  I had to skip ahead more than once, but overall the quality was good.",1320883200,,154,4.464285714285714
4469478,5,B004UMV3P0,"I love Dexter and thought I would share the series with my girl friend as the series we were watching ended and now we have some time to kill. So I ordered the complete series KNOWING what a good time we would have. This is NOT a review of the series which I highly recommend ... it is a review of the seller RSALESW and the shipping arrangements. I ordered the series on October 11th, and asked for expidited shipping. I paid for the item (87.97 up front) and the shipping and then got an email telling me the anticipated delivery date was between October 17th and November 1st. What kind of delivery is that ? I was fuming but I waited, then when Nov 1 came and went I was pi$$ed. I could have walked there and back to get my DVD's in that time. Now it's November 8th and still the package lists as being ""in transit"". Maybe Old Saint Nick will bring it and put them under my tree. Totally p$$ed and Dexter-less in Seattle.",1320710400,,925,4.202247191011236
4469479,5,B004UMV3P0,"A show about a serial killer that is so much deeper than it appears at first glance. The writing for the series is brilliant and the audience really feels for the protagonist. As the series progresses it does have a bit of a formula, as any TV show does, but the characters lives seem to keep going and progressing which is not always pulled off so well on a TV show. The constant conflict of characters and audience keeps the show interesting for years. The Blu-Ray transfers are excellent and the picture quality really stands out.",1320105600,,533,4.5625
4469480,5,B004UMV3P0,"This particular story theme is not something that I would have ever considered watching, but while my son was watching one of the programs I was listening, became engrossed, and thus addicted to this series.
Thankfully I was able to purchase the entire series and was able to spend an entire day and night watching it.
This is definitely Dark Judgement being meted out by an official member of the police squad who takes Justice into his own hands and dispenses back to the offender what he did to the men,women, or children he had killed.
The suspense kept me glued to the screen, and even though the series is Dark, surprisingly humorous situations do pop up causing laughter along with the terror of watching judgement being served to those who richly deserve it..",1319760000,,767,4.731343283582089
4469481,4,B004UMV3P0,I love Dexter and missed season 3-5. I am excited to watch it. And for $90 dollars it's a great deal,1318982400,,100,3.8095238095238093
4469482,5,B004UMV3P0,"Great deal, amazing show.  BLu Ray quality is great!  Makes a lot of sense to buy the entire series.  Dexter is a show that is still great after 5 seasons.",1318550400,,155,4.1
4469483,5,B004UMV3P0,"I myself don't watch Dexter but everyone around me is obsessed with it.  It just happened to be deal of the day for $90 a week before my sisters birthday so I decided to buy it for her, and I'm glad I did.  She watches it everyday,  and loves it very much.  I hope to come across a deal like this again.",1318204800,,303,3.838709677419355
4469484,1,B004UMV3P0,"This is cheaper if you buy each season separately...  (PLEASE NOTE: This review is for the DVD version, not the Blu-ray)

4469485,5,B004UMV3P0,"This is, hands down, the best show I have ever seen and is my favorite show of all time. Everyone should watch this show. I've seen all of the seasons and it never falters in the slightest.",1315353600,15,189,4.135135135135135
4469486,5,B004UMV3P0,"We recently watched season 5 of Dexter and couldn't stand for it to be over with. So we decided to purchase seasons 1 through 5 so we could watch it over and over again. We're currently doing a Dexter marathon and loving it. This is one of the best shows we've ever seen! Dexter has everything, good story, great music. It's a GREAT series!",1315353600,23,340,4.328125
4469487,5,B004UMV3P0,This is a great deal for the entire series of Dexter. I love love love Dexter and when I saw all 5 seasons at this price I could not pass it up. Only wish that it was on blue ray for this price. But this will do.,1397260800,,212,3.5319148936170213
4469488,5,B004UMV3P0,"Got it for a friend to start, and get her into it.  Three weeks later she was done with all five seasons.

Enough said, right?",1390262400,,126,4.0
4469489,5,B004UMV3P0,I appreciated that seasons 1-5 were available in a set since I had already purchased seasons 6-7 elsewhere and really didn't want to piece mail the series together anymore than I had to.  Incredibly fair priced and quick turn around.  Thank you!,1388707200,,245,4.809523809523809
4469490,5,B004UMV3P0,"These shows are just as good as the books! I couldn't believe it. I read that some poor fellow bought a set from eBay and it was a bad copy. These are the real thing. Gotta get the rest of the seasons. Ooooo, and that MAN!",1384905600,,222,3.847826086956522
4469491,5,B004UMV3P0,"Who would ever think you'd go crazy for a serial killer :)

We missed the first seasons and had always wondered what
had happened in the begining.

This was a great deal",1381536000,,169,4.25
4469492,5,B004UMV3P0,My Granddaughter said it was great. She loved it and watched all seasons. We heard it is going off the air so she is excited she has 5 series,1379030400,,141,3.896551724137931
4469493,1,B004UMV3P0,"The first time I played them, a number of discs got ""stuck"", often on the main menu. Thinking the problem might have been with my player, I bought a new player, but the discs continued to stick, although in different places. I wrote to the seller and was told that each season could be replaced so long as I returned the entire season. As I didn't know which discs would stick in that case, I just chalked this off to experience, but I don't want others to waste their money the way I did. The film quality of the discs, though good, is less than it should be. Some features, like audio commentary, are not available. I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but I believe these discs have not come directly from Showtime.",1377043200,,720,4.340740740740741
4469494,5,B004UMV3P0,We find ourselves wanting to get home to find out what is going to happen next.  The show is written very well and you don't find yourself thinking you missed something.  Now I need to get the last 6 thru 8.,1375142400,,207,4.024390243902439
4469495,5,B004UMV3P0,I missed the the first couple of episodes of dexter so I bought these and boy am I glad. This is the best show I ever watched!!!,1368230400,,128,3.7777777777777777

4469497,5,B004UMV3P0,"I love this TV Show. I guess it is a little dark because the main character/protagonist is a serial killer. Once you start watching, you can't stop.",1361145600,,148,4.518518518518518
4469498,5,B004UMV3P0,"This series of five seasons was wonderful. I had only seen years 6-7 so I was able to catch up on everything. The DVDs were advertised as ""used"" but only Season One was used. The rest were brand new and still in their packaging. The one used one was in excellent shape.",1360972800,,269,4.1923076923076925
4469499,5,B004UMV3P0,Bought this for my wife and she could not stop watching. Can't wait for the new season. This show is much better than anything on regular TV.,1360540800,,141,4.2592592592592595
4469500,1,B004UMV3P0,"I purchased seasons 1-5 of Dexter, what I received were cheap copies of the series that were pixelated. Now if i want to actually enjoy the series I'm gunna need to repurchase them. : (  Very disapointed with this seller! ! !",1360454400,,225,4.357142857142857
4469501,5,B004UMV3P0,"I do not have anything negative to add...It's Dexter.  Amazing storyline, great characters.  Loosely based on the book series.  I have enjoyed following Dexter and purchased the Blu-ray discs because I do rewatch them and wanted to own them.",1359331200,,241,5.128205128205129
4469502,5,B004UMV3P0,"So I had gotten a free episode of Dexter, season 1 episode 1 ... that was what started it, now I'm hooked, a lot... I've already watched 1-5 TWICE and starting the 6th season tomorrow. I honestly cannot think of any real negatives about the show -- other than the adult content I suppose. LOTS of violence and a lot of great story, sometimes you feel like crying, then other times you're on the edge of your seat... and other times you are in tears from laughing at Masuka!

To summarize, the answer is yes, you wish to pay for this item... all 6 seasons... and you want to invest in something of a pass that gives you every season from here on out!",1359158400,,649,4.233870967741935
4469503,5,B004UMV3P0,"I can't afford ""Showtime"" on cable. Dexter is a great show so got seasons 1-5 for my grown family members.",1357516800,,106,4.35
4469504,5,B004UMV3P0,Its not a box set like most but if you love Dexter and want to see it all again in Hi Def then buy this set. I just wish that it more special features like a most box sets.,1357344000,,172,3.4358974358974357
4469505,5,B004UMV3P0,I love Dexter!  Now we just need to buy the next few seasons. This was a great Black Friday Deal.,1356652800,,97,3.85

4469507,5,B004UMV3P0,"The wife and I have just finished our Dexter Marathon. It is captivating, we had to force ourselves to stop watching and go to bed. We just wanted to keep on watching. Season 4 with John Lithgow as the Trinity Killer is in my opinion the best season ever.",1356480000,,255,4.224489795918367
4469508,3,B004UMV3P0,Love the show but very disappointed that I got two Season Two and no Season Four.  I had taken all the plastic off before I realized this so I can't return it.  Anyone get two Season Four and no Season Two?  Maybe Amazon can help us exchange.,1356393600,,242,4.1063829787234045
4469509,4,B004UMV3P0,My wife loved watching it.  We are on season four out of the five.  Great story lines.  Looking forward to getting season six.,1356393600,,126,4.391304347826087
4469510,5,B004UMV3P0,"I was reluctant to watch it at first, it sounded strange.  a serial killer that works for the police and is a serial killer (no spoiler there). I got so hooked I had to buy the complete set when it went on sale, so glad i did. Yes, I am hooked!!",1355702400,,245,3.803921568627451
4469511,4,B004UMV3P0,"Usually you can see predictable outcomes in a series; however, Dexter remains imaginably provocative and 'cutting-edge' (no pun intended, or maybe so...hmmm).  Very entertaining and for some reason, you find yourself supporting and 'rooting' for a serial killers' killer. Well-scripted and written plot.",1355097600,,303,6.046511627906977
4469512,5,B004UMV3P0,"Love this set. I started watching Dexter during the season of the Trinity Killer and I haven't let up since!

I'm happy that I'm able to finally watch Dexter from the beginning. Going back and seeing how he acts compared to present day episodes is very refreshing, as he seems to be an almost completely different person.

The only thing bad about watching a lot of Dexter is watching a lot of Dexter intro and previous scenes before the episode starts.",1355097600,,453,4.580246913580247
4469513,5,B004UMV3P0,This is probably in my top 3 shows on tv. Each season is progressively better than the one before it and season 4 may be the best season of tv in my opinion.  Great show!,1355097600,,170,3.857142857142857
4469514,5,B004UMV3P0,If you haven't heard of Dexter you must live under a rock because this is actually a show worth watching and buying!,1354492800,,116,4.318181818181818
4469515,5,B004UMV3P0,"Great, each episode is addictive.  I spend hours watching the show till I fall asleep.  Can't wait till season 7 comes out.",1354147200,,123,4.545454545454546
4469516,5,B004UMV3P0,"I purchased this on the lightning deals offer for ~$110 and cannot be any more satisfied. The seasons come bundled together but are still individual cases per season. I have noticed that this gives me a kid-feeling when I get to unwrap each season as I finish one. Coupled with Amazon Prime, I received the discs relatively fast and spent no time before opening them to begin enjoying.

The first few seasons of the series have a bluray quality that is not so advanced as newer movies and TV shows but I am assuming this is because of earlier high definition technology not being as advanced as it has become in the past few years (first season was in 2006!). Nonetheless, it is far superior quality than your standard DVD's. This is a great buy no matter what the price is, I just got lucky and purchased it through the lightning deals.",1354060800,,837,4.506578947368421
4469517,1,B004UMV3P0,I had to skip some episodes since not all worked! So disappointed i decided to just give it away. Should have listened to other reviews,1353456000,,135,4.44
4469518,5,B004UMV3P0,"This really is an enjoyable show. I won't bother repeating the blow by blow account of the seasons provided here by others, but i do want to share how much I enjoyed this collection. Please note, it can be purchased for half the price from amazon.uk.co. In fact, you can buy this PLUS a region 2 DVD player and still have enough money left over for pizza. Plus, then you can order some of the great British dramas such as Cracker starring Robbie Coltrane, or the original (and superior) Shameless, or a great comedy like Benidorm.",1352332800,,530,4.53125
4469519,2,B004UMV3P0,"It is a great show, but you can watch it on net flix via the internet.  Why would you pay 127.00.",1352332800,,97,3.619047619047619
4469520,5,B004UMV3P0,"Dexter is such a great show!!!! And I totally reccommend getting it on blu-ray, it's so much clearer!!! I'm absolutely obsessed!!!!",1350950400,,131,5.285714285714286
4469521,5,B004UMV3P0,Excellent price and no problems with discs.  I got hooked when series was available on Netflix but that was short lived.  I'm a huge fan so having all 5 seasons available at once provided for uninterrupted viewing but didn't do much for my sleep deficit.,1347667200,,254,4.622222222222222
4469522,5,B004UMV3P0,"What can I say seeing this on tv was great but being able to see it on blu ray and be able to see more than one episode at a time, perfect!",1347667200,,139,3.375
4469523,5,B004UMV3P0,A great series.  Brilliant in concept and superb in execution.  Love this series.  Brilliant idea about a serial killer who only kills other serial killers.,1347667200,,156,5.16
4469524,5,B004UMV3P0,"Items took a while to get to me, even though they shipped from within my home state. Despite the wait, I am 100% satisfied with the quality of the DVDs.",1347148800,,152,4.1
4469525,1,B004UMV3P0,"I absolutely love the dexter series but the quality of these disc are awful. I ordered 1-5 and all was going great until the final disc of season 4. The brand new dvd player said the disc was unreadable so I played it on dvd player 2. It played but for the little digital squares and occasional freeze ups. Ok, I guess that is do-able so on to season 5. New dvd player had a lot of freeze ups so moved it to dvd player 2. Still had freeze ups, lips not matched up with the words, lots of digital squares and before it would play the end the dvd player gave it up and went to stop. Back to dvd player one and it went to stop also. Then I tried playing it on my computer and it played most of the dvds except the very end of the episodes. So back to the internet where I deleted season 6 from my shopping cart. I'm back to looking for my dvds at the used book stores and pawn shops. There is a diffeent looking set of Dexter at best buy, 3 discs instead of 4 but pretty pricey.  My seller didn't responded to my email and their profile has been pulled.",1345852800,,1050,3.952830188679245
4469526,5,B004UMV3P0,"This stuff is off the hizook. Everything came as stated by the seller, no problems with the dvd's. It came in on time and seller even added person emails back with information on the order. This is a great buy from amazon and would make a great addition to anyone's collection.",1345852800,,277,4.450980392156863
4469527,4,B004UMV3P0,I bought this as a present originally and we have been watching it continuously. I can't be angry with the quality since it is very good especially on my HDTV. however I have noticed that there is a weird compatiability issue with these discs and my macbook pro. If it worked perfectly on it then I would have given it 5 stars,1344988800,,326,4.274193548387097
4469528,5,B004UMV3P0,fantastic! one of the best shows ever. it has everything you could want in a show. michael c hall is great as the likeable serial killer. tune in!,1344988800,,146,4.25
4469529,3,B004UMV3P0,"So I love the Dexter series. Love it. But why the 3 stars you ask? on one of my disks.....I couldn't play the season finale. Upon looking at the disk and freaking out it was my DVD player, It looks as if the disk had been stamped wrong (the circle in the middle of the DVD....there that but an exact indented replica of that circle next to it which runs over into the actual recorded part) So I'm out the third season finale. Which I'm not happy with and im stuck with that ONE disk that is like that.

BUT with that being said I do love Dexter. Great series",1342569600,2,558,4.072727272727272

Well we are through Season 3 and each episode is a better than the last.  We can't wait to sit down and watch the next disc. Highly recommend for anyone who is a mystery fan.

4469536,1,B004UMV3P0,"When offering bundle seasons, the costs are typically lower then what it costs to buy them individually.  This is not the case with this product.  Go buy them separate and save some money.  Don't give in to the machine, fight it.

Update  - Since posting this they have conviently raised all prices on the single seasons of Dexter.  Wait to buy when the prices come down.  There is some price gouging going on here.",1333584000,3,415,4.527027027027027

I requested a refund and instead the Vidiot sent me another set of DVDs. The customer service was prompt; however when I received the second set, the package only contained Seasons 1-4, which is not what I payed for.
I have contacted this seller several times and I would not recommend buying this company's DVDs. They are sketchy and not worth the money.",1333065600,6,629,4.625

4469542,5,B004UMV3P0,"What a great packaged deal.  The paper seemed a little flimsy for some reason but that doesn't matter when you're watching the DVDs.  So far, so good!",1330041600,,150,4.518518518518518
4469543,5,B004UMV3P0,"If you love dexter then you will love these DVDs. Very fast delivery ,all new , good quality , loved watching all of  them",1329523200,,122,4.083333333333333
4469544,3,B004UMV3P0,"The show attempts to be clever -- make a serial killer -- who kills serial killers -- someone we can root for.  It doesn't really hit that goal.  Dexter is a homicidal maniac, who loves to butcher people.  He gets a thrill out of it.  He is not out for justice.  In the end, he is a psychotic vigilante who imagines he serves the public good by eliminating killers.  What makes the show interesting, is how close he comes to being caught in each episode.  But do we sympathize, or empathize with him -- is he a hero?  No.  He is a serial killer.

Three stars for production values, acting, and plots.",1328572800,,600,4.276785714285714
4469545,5,B004UMV3P0,"This is probably one of my favorite shows on TV right now. There is humor, drama, and a little bit of action. I love detective shows and this incorporates that aspect with some original ideas as well. This is the best Showtime show out of all I have seen. I like how they focus on one serial killer or theme each season - Ice Truck Killer, Trinity, etc. This show just keeps getting better and better!",1328054400,,401,4.2894736842105265
4469546,5,B004UMV3P0,What can I say about DEXTER except I cannot wait until next Fall to see Season 6!! I watched all 5 seasons in 2wks. It was so addicting and exciting to watch...What a great Storyline!! I do not get Showtime so this is the only way I can watch this Show..This was a Christmas present from my Son to Me...The best present EVER!!! What a great Price it was on Amazon...We Love shopping with Amazon!! You need to put 10 stars up there for this DVD set~~,1327536000,,449,4.172413793103448
4469547,5,B004UMV3P0,This is one of the most unique and awesome show that I have come across for awhile.  Michael C Hall makes does an amazing job having a duel life as a blood spatter analyst and a serial killer.  He also teaches an important lesson of how people with dark passengers can keep secrets and will take them to the grave,1326758400,,313,4.2
4469548,4,B004UMV3P0,"I purchased this Blue ray series for a Christmas gift, I was a little bit surprise that the packaging looked cheap, But the person loved the gift and said it is great quality",1326672000,,174,4.303030303030303
4469549,2,B004UMV3P0,Problems with season 1 dvd. Scrambled and Dvd player said invalid dvd on the second dvd.couldn't watch at all. Notified merchant and they are sending  a new season 1. we'll see how that is and will be getting back to you on that.,1326672000,,229,4.325581395348837
4469550,5,B004UMV3P0,"This is a lot better than I had thought- my daughter loves this series, and her boyfriend (who is more sports/action-adventure/sci-fi/horror fan) is also a big fan of this series.
Quite the psychodrama, very intense, very deep.",1326585600,,227,5.162162162162162
4469551,3,B004UMV3P0,"Just got turned on to Dexter and my husband and I wanted to catch up on the first 5 seasons we missed. The quality of the picture is not what I would have expected, sometimes fuzzy, sometimes too dark. The image never gets really sharp. Other than that, the delivery came quickly. Paid a lot of money for this package (which I have never done before) and feel a little cheated.",1326585600,3,377,4.323943661971831
4469552,5,B004UMV3P0,Dexter is definitely a unique show.  An investigator that is a serial killer that only kills serial killers.  huh?  Yup...interesting.  Dexter himself is an odd bird.  A little on the creepy side but you will feel sorry for him at times.  I am only on season 2 so I can't say how good all the seasons are but the 20+ episodes I've watched so far have me hooked.,1326499200,,361,4.235294117647059
4469553,5,B004UMV3P0,My fiance's son wanted this series...so we decided to get it for him for Christmas..shopped around then found this deal...it came in mail rapidly and as expected for a happy Christmas gift...thanks alot and excellent awsomeness !!!,1326153600,,231,5.27027027027027
4469554,5,B004UMV3P0,I started watching Dexter when it first came out.  I was addicted from the very beginning.  The characters and the story line keep you captivated.  The only problem was waiting a week till the next show...and then waiting months till the next season.  After the first season ended I started buying the show...one season at a time.  Each year before the season started I would watch every season preceding the present one.  I have as I have said purchased one at a time.  So many people are now aware of the show but haven't had the chance to watch past seasons.  This is a gift I have given to those people that have just made the discovery and love what they see.  Well worth buying...I know I will watch this series over and over for years to come.,1326067200,,750,4.3768115942028984
4469555,3,B004UMV3P0,"WELL, I AM A TOTAL FAN OF THE SERIES BUT THE 5TH SEASON WAS MISSING THE THRILL AND BECAME QUITE REPETITIVE/BORING. HOPE THE 6TH SEASON GOES BACK TO THE INITIAL INCREDIBLE DEXTER. UP TO SEASON 4 IT IT A 5 STAR BUT SEASON 5 IS A MERE 3, TO ME!",1324080000,,241,3.84
4469556,5,B004UMV3P0,"Do not buy this product on ebay.  They are all bootlegs.  Just bought one and the quality is horrible.  You are much better off buying directly from Amazon.  As one other reviewer pointed out, the individual seasons are much cheaper, especially since season 1-4 are now $12.99 each (EDIT- Not any more!).

Still, worth having.  Dexter is great.",1322265600,10,344,4.844827586206897
