3038203,5,B000Z6RH7I,"If you've ever watched Caillou over & over, you're familiar with all the episodes...so pretty much these are all repeats, some with the earlier ""whiny"" Caillou & some with the later ""matured"" Caillou. However, there are NO puppets, which is what I was looking for..yay! There's opening credits from the earlier show with them but they DO NOT make an appearance AT ALL. There are ads for other DVDs at the start of the DVD but what DVD doesn't have that. The only way to bypass them is fast forward. Before the episodes starts, of course they include the PBS Kids sponsor acknowledgement for Chuck E Cheese like they do on the station. Unfortunately you can't skip it; no biggie, it doesn't last long or you can fast forward. I'm happy with this purchase & happy my 2 year old will be happy with her favorite show.",1412467200,,813,4.537414965986395

3038279,1,B000Z6RH7I,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.

There are ""puppet shows"" after every single episode of Caillou. The product description on the Walmart site did not mention that. It makes it seem like the DVD's are straight Caillou for 80 minutes or 100 minutes, whatever. THEY'RE NOT! My 2 year old has no desire to view anything other than Caillou. You have to find the remote after each episode and be prepared to go to the play list and select the next Caillou episode, as the dumb puppet shows come on after EVERY episode of Caillou. Frustrating!!!!!! DO NOT BUY ANY OF THE ABOVE WITHOUT ASKING about the puppet shows being on a particular DVD.

Ironically you will find many people whining that Caillou is whiny. Apparently some think he is whiney in old episodes only and some say it is newer episodes. Some say he is whiney in Sprout episodes and some say PBS episodes. I wasn't aware that the channels played different episodes. Some will only let their kids watch ""non whiney"" episodes as if their leaving the work of modeling good behavior to television. If Caillou is acting up in an episode, you could use the opportunity to point out how his behavior is poor and what the consequences are if your own kids were to behave like that.
In some circumatances Caillou is whiney and some he is not, but that is parallel to at least most parents reality.
What's great about Caillou is that he is learning and experiencing things just like all young children. My children find him fascinating and I appreciate the simplicity and gentleness of the program. His parents model patience which most parents, like myself, could use more.
The best part about this particular DVD is there are no puppets, my girls do not like them at all. I consider this program safe to ""babysit"" my girls for a few minutes :)",1324339200,,1196,4.567441860465117

It shows life from the perspective of a 5 year old, the characters have real world personalities (no dancing dinosaurs).  The story lines follows an extended family and the situations are positive and educational.  Now my daughters mention the characters in conversations.  For example, ""Say thank you, like Caillou does.""  Caillou can be whiny once in a while (as noted in the low score reviews) but what child his age isn't at times?

It's a few of the old favorite episodes with some new ones thrown in, and we appreciate the values highlighted in each epsiode.  We use Calliou's situations with family and friends as discussion points for appropriate and inappropriate behaviors and actions.  The shows are well-written and light-hearted, but realistic.

The only thing that I wish the DVD had was rolling credits after each episode, but for selfish reasons - the credits are how my children know the episode is over! :-)

However, there are NO puppets, which is what I was looking for..yay! There's opening credits from the earlier show with them but they DO NOT make an appearance AT ALL. There are ads for other DVDs at the start of the DVD but what DVD doesn't have that. The only way to bypass them is fast forward. Before the episodes starts, of course they include the PBS Kids sponsor acknowledgement for Chuck E Cheese like they do on the station. Unfortunately you can't skip it; no biggie, it doesn't last long or you can fast forward.

3272776,1,B000Z6RH7I,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.

It makes it seem like the DVD's are straight Caillou for 80 minutes or 100 minutes, whatever. THEY'RE NOT! My 2 year old has no desire to view anything other than Caillou. You have to find the remote after each episode and be prepared to go to the play list and select the next Caillou episode, as the dumb puppet shows come on after EVERY episode of Caillou. Frustrating!!!!!! DO NOT BUY ANY OF THE ABOVE WITHOUT ASKING about the puppet shows being on a particular DVD.

3272838,5,B000Z6RH7I,"This is a great DVD of a great program.
Ironically you will find many people whining that Caillou is whiny. Apparently some think he is whiney in old episodes only and some say it is newer episodes. Some say he is whiney in Sprout episodes and some say PBS episodes. I wasn't aware that the channels played different episodes. Some will only let their kids watch ""non whiney"" episodes as if their leaving the work of modeling good behavior to television. If Caillou is acting up in an episode, you could use the opportunity to point out how his behavior is poor and what the consequences are if your own kids were to behave like that.
In some circumatances Caillou is whiney and some he is not, but that is parallel to at least most parents reality.
What's great about Caillou is that he is learning and experiencing things just like all young children. My children find him fascinating and I appreciate the simplicity and gentleness of the program. His parents model patience which most parents, like myself, could use more.
The best part about this particular DVD is there are no puppets, my girls do not like them at all. I consider this program safe to ""babysit"" my girls for a few minutes :)",1324339200,,1196,4.567441860465117

My daughters love it.  We have many DVDS, barney, winnie-the-poo, etc and Caillou is their favorite.  It shows life from the perspective of a 5 year old, the characters have real world personalities (no dancing dinosaurs).  The story lines follows an extended family and the situations are positive and educational.  Now my daughters mention the characters in conversations.  For example, ""Say thank you, like Caillou does.""  Caillou can be whiny once in a while (as noted in the low score reviews) but what child his age isn't at times?  I think his family demonstrate well how to young children in a bad mood, with light hearted humor and thoughtful distractions.

It's a few of the old favorite episodes with some new ones thrown in, and we appreciate the values highlighted in each epsiode.  We use Calliou's situations with family and friends as discussion points for appropriate and inappropriate behaviors and actions.  The shows are well-written and light-hearted, but realistic.

The only thing that I wish the DVD had was rolling credits after each episode, but for selfish reasons - the credits are how my children know the episode is over! :-)
