The what if the storms that are on Saturn were to come to Earth and what would happen to life as we know it. The special effects were outstanding in how a Red Twister would come alive and destroy all living matter and buildings and so on came across with such uncanny believable realism. If I did not know better I would think the special effects creator had visit the giant Red planet in their spare time. Even though this is SyFy channel TV movie the story line and acting by all was quit well and not stiff and robot like in some movies with young or under train actor and actresses. You will not be bored and will find yourself on the edge of your seat with the roller coaster ride wild ride that five people will keep you on as they must all somehow survive the Red Twister full of self generating deadly lighting strikes that feeds on all matter while trying to recreate another Red Planet, another Saturn.

5761673,3,B00CZ138YM,"Somewhere in America three teenagers and one who writing a story for the school newspaper are spending there Saturday on detention on the one day that the Earth is being hit by some crazy storm that is killing people. Of course, one of the students have an idea of what is happening and her dad just happens to be building a rocket that can be used to fix everything. The question become who will be killed by the lighting before they can save the Earth.
""Super Storm"" is a decent disaster movie with a bunch of characters who you just know that are not going to make it the end alive. A one of the them is going to make supreme sacrifice to save everyone (I kind of knew by the middle who that was going to be.)  But overall ""Super Storm"" was an okay movie but not a keeper.",1416960000,2,775,4.166666666666667

5761678,4,B00CZ138YM,B-flick movies have their own criteria. Overall a well done film.,1410048000,,65,5.0
5761679,4,B00CZ138YM,"This disaster flick takes place in a small-small town where few people are seen while untold millions are killed off-screen via hearsay (New York, Boston, and Washington DC).  Of the already miniscule cast, few survive.  The scenes jump rapidly from enclave to enclave dealing with a barebones assessment of family dynamics, 2 bickering scientists with a single clue, and the suspect friendships among a tiny group of teens stuck in detention.  The man in charge of these teens, including his son, proves an unerring lack of good judgment as the movie progresses.  As with most movies like this, science terms are bandied about like they're going to mean anything to those of us who are just looking for action, suspense, and yes, a lot of crazy destruction (it doesn't qualify as a disaster flick if something doesn't get destroyed).  In this case, buildings are reduced to nothing in the blink of an eye, people too.  But it's not nearly enough devastation to justify their chatter about worldwide obliteration.  (Truthfully, when they started yapping about some `destruction particle' and some foo-ton or was that futon, phooey-ton-ton-tooey-something...........  I began to lose interest.)  At least it rushed the plot along at a goodly pace, enough so you don't notice the obvious improbabilities like a plane crashing at a convenient location so the detention dad (David Sutcliffe) can just happen to be in the area at the perfect moment to move the plot along to the next obvious point (it felt less like a plot and more like a check list at that juncture).  Still, there's enough goofy charm amongst the small cast to make things interesting.  I liked it.  I'd watch it again someday.  I just don't want to have to feel like I need to study up on Jupiter in order to get what's going on.",1409875200,3,1795,4.865131578947368

5761682,4,B00CZ138YM,"it got here in good shape, and it played fine. thanks",1404345600,2,53,3.909090909090909
5761683,3,B00CZ138YM,"It's too bad. Somewhere in America's heartland three students serving high school detention (and one other student who's just there to do a story for the school newspaper) were maybe on their way to bonding like them kids from The Breakfast Club. But then that monster electrical storm got brewin' and devastatin' and there went the off chance of being serenaded by Simple Minds' ""Don't You Forget About Me."" My guess is that the kids' detention project of cleaning up the gym for next Monday's science fair is gonna to have to wait a second.

The film alerts us that, uh oh, Jupiter's notorious zit - the Great Red Spot - has suddenly vanished. And here on planet home, reports rage on of unexplained weather disturbances, of storms volatile enough that they'd already laid waste to chunks of the eastern seaboard. New York, Boston, Washington DC... they're obliterated.

Only one scientist seems on the ball. A particle physicist named Carolyn (Erica Cerra) has put two and two together and added it up to ""Oh, sh--!"" Carolyn's been eyeing a potential scientific breakthrough, this discovery courtesy of a high school girl's science project. This girl, Megan MacGregor (Luisa D'Oliveira), happens to be one of the three teens serving detention. Carolyn theorizes that the girl's invention attracts ""destruction particles"" (or x-bosons), which is unheard of as these particles can only be found on gas giants... like Jupiter dunh-dunh-DUNH!). Off Carolyn flies to the ""dull end of nowhere,"" as her colleague dubs Heartfield, Midwest America. But what can a smalltown girl's school project do against the Great Red Spot, now relocated to Earth and about to trigger a nuclear genesis - that is, alter solid particles into gases? This is not good as much of the stuff on Earth is made out of solid particles. This may be the worst detention ever.

Luckily, we have several Syfy veterans on the job. If anything can avert doomsday, it's gotta be a crew composed of Eureka's Deputy Jo Lupo, The X-Files' Asst. Director Skinner, and, um, Rory's dad from The Gilmore Girls.

Once in a while a Syfy Channel Original Movie goes off the reservation and startles its audience by not sucking too much. Space Twister - a.k.a. Super Storm; a.k.a. Mega Cyclone; a.k.a. Big Wind (okay, that last one's fake) - was surprisingly watchable. Sure, it wanders eagerly into speculative science - the existence of x-bosons has yet to be truly proven - and the plot coasts down that familiar road. But the acting performances are decent and the visual effects may be the best I'd seen from a Syfy production in ages (or ever?). It has to be a nice change of pace for Erica Cerra who steps away from playing the brawn on Eureka to here taking on a more cerebral role. It's great to see Mitch Pileggi, as well. True to his sci-fi street creds, his character - Megan's ex-R & D rocket scientist - is tough as nails. In one scene he gets shocked and plummets off a lofty windmill but then gets up and shakes it off after a minute.

Plot holes? Yep, of course. I'm no science geek so I won't even broach the veracity of the messed-up meteorology posited here. ***And maybe a SPOILERS alert now for the rest of the paragraph*** I do question Mitch Pileggi's decision to keep on climbing up that windmill even after multiple tremors. I question the late (and very convenient) introduction of that experimental rocket sitting in the barn. And I guess we're left to assume that the dispersal of the local storm, in fact, reflects dispersal on a global scale. They sure didn't show that onscreen (yay, crap budget). Maybe the biggest neg for me is that Will's (Brett Dier) parents hadn't a clue that their son was a genius. This long-held obliviousness makes me think less of David Sutcliffe's and Leah Cairns' characters. Still, overall, Space Twister slides over to the watchable side by virtue of earnest acting, decent production values, and a general damping down of hokey elements. And if you're a fan of Smallville, you may get a small thrill when you recognize Gunter MacGregor's farm as the same location set as the old Kent farm.",1395100800,10,4106,4.7856135401974615

8587736,4,B00CZ138YM,"Worth watching. The acting was good and the story, while somewhat predictable, had a few twists and turns. I personally enjoy anything having to do with physical science; in this case electromagnetic energy and subatomic particles such as ""Higgs Boson"". I gave it four stars rather than five because it lacked a strong scientific character and scientific explanations. There was very little elaboration concerning the science behind the storm. A fast talking physics whiz kid type as Will's sidekick, would have added some excitement and credibility to the overall theme... Instead, the director resorted to the addition of ""hit and barely a miss scenes"" that are so typical in disaster movies! A whiz kid character with the proverbial glasses and nerdy haircut, probably would have raised the film into the 5 star range. Still, it was entertaining and better than most natural disaster stories.",1519171200,,895,5.222222222222222
