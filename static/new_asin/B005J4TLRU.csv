4711196,4,B005J4TLRU,"5 DAYS OF WAR is a disturbing film on many levels; it takes us into the bowels of an active war zone sharing the bloody ravenous hunger of war and the effects on the citizens of the invaded country, it is raw in its depiction of what happens to non-combatant journalists who are embedded to document the truth, and it is embarrassing how little the outside world knew of this brief but devastating war between Russia and Georgia in 2008 a war concomitant with the Olympic Games in Beijing, China so hungrily observed by the media.  It tests our priorities of information intake and in doing so puts a quite different perspective on world events.  The story is based on true facts and is well paced by writers Mikko Alanne and David Battle and directed with unrelenting intensity by Renny Harlin.

The film opens with three journalists and photographers - Thomas Anders (Rupert Friend), Sebastian Ganz (Richard Coyle), and Miriam (Heather Graham) - riding in a jeep in apparently placid countryside when they are struck by a bomb killing Miriam and leaving both Thomas and Sebastian injured.  It soon becomes obvious that Georgia is being attacked by the Russians who (we are told) fear that Georgia is becoming too attached to the West!  Flashes back and forth between comment from the reluctant President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia (Andy Garcia) who demands a cease fire and clips of Putin and his representative Col. Alexandr Demidov (Rade Serbedzija) who increase the bombing bring the tension to the breaking point.  Innocent people are killed, the journalists find refuge in a Georgian wedding where Thomas and Sebastian meet Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) who then joins them in carrying out their mission: the journalists have captured on film footage of the Russians slaughtering civilians and are determined to get the memory card of that incident of truth to authorities who will stop the Russian attack.  How the action proceeds during the brief 5 days is riveting to watch and enlightening to know.

Along the way there are others who support the journalists insistence on securing the truth memory card, fine cameo roles for Johnathan Schech, Val Kilmer, Dean Cain, Ken Cranham, Antje Traue and a host of Georgian actors.  For some this may seem like just another war film, but for others it will turn on a light to an all but forgotten (if even known) incident of brutality that should alert everyone to the possibilities of similar events that are in progress around the globe.

4711197,4,B005J4TLRU,Good action movie.  Solid action scenes throughout.  Good acting by most and a compelling story.  Movie is about he Russian invasion of the former Soviet republic of Georgia.  A very pro Western country that wants into the EU and NATO.  The media enjoyed ignoring this little war at the time because we were bogged down in Iraq and Russia knew this when they decided to invade.  The people of Georgia were left to be slaughterd alone fighting Russian agression as this movie shows.  This movie deserves much more press than it is getting.  Its no DieHard but true real life ussually isn't.,1323820800,12,589,4.705882352941177
4711198,5,B005J4TLRU,"This was an excellent movie that depicted events of the Georgian  5 day war with Russia. It's was action packed, moving and showed how BIG bullies can inflict much pain and suffering on innocent people who just wanted independence and freedom. The plot was great and showed much of what refugees went through to survive. After the credits you will see moving testimonials of family members who lost loved ones during these tragic events. Shame on Russia and the those who did not help Georgia during their crisis. It's amazing how little exposure this movie had here in the U.S. I guess if it doesn't affect us, it's not worth our attention. Praise to those reporters that risk their lives to cover these war time events. Their daring courage is commended and sometimes get's criticized or goes unnoticed.",1323561600,4,805,4.833333333333333
4711199,3,B005J4TLRU,"Good movie, with decent acting and some memorable quotes. Some of us may have noticed this little war on the news or on the web as it was mentioned here and there. I remember  seeing images of some of the fighting and aftermath on a few websites. This brings a lot of what we might have heard or seen more into focus.

Not a Russian friendly movie by any stretch of the imagination, it also does not paint anyone else for that matter nicely as we all just basically ignored what was going on and all watched the Olympics.

Worth renting if you enjoy a good modern war movie with some geopolitical ramifications and some selfless heroism.",1322870400,3,637,4.427350427350428
4711200,4,B005J4TLRU,"I had never heard of this movie, but am glad that I saw it.  (It's better than most things currently playing in the theater.)  The story describes the 5-day 2008 Russo-Georgian war.  I enjoyed Rupert Friend's (also in Pride and Prejudice) performance as a reporter who risks his life to smuggle a video of war atrocities committed by the Russians against the Georgians.  Andy Garcia acts as the Georgian president trying to defend his country against Russian attack.  Val Kilmer, Dean Cain and Heather Graham also have bit roles.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies about modern day warfare.",1322784000,5,613,4.902912621359223
4711201,3,B005J4TLRU,"""We came here to cover a war, if we don't get a story this will all unfold unseen."" This is an emotional and sometimes tense movie about reporters in Georgia during the war with Russia. Thomas Anders (Friend) is an American journalist sent to document the growing tension between the two countries. When war breaks out it is up to him to report and get the truth out. This is a movie that is pretty moving and tense, but also very slow. A mix between battle scenes and the reporters dodging bullets trying to stay alive long enough to get the story out to the rest of the world. If you like movies like the ""Bang-Bang Club"" this will very much appeal to you. I did enjoy this movie, but it seemed like it was just not quite as good as it could have been. The cast was great and it was a very good movie, but it had the possibility of being better. I'm not sure what it needed though. Overall, a good movie that could have been better. I give it a B-.

4711202,5,B005J4TLRU,"This movie is very close to reality - what heppaned in Georgia in 2008. I am from the second troubled region of GA - from Abkhazia, and I know what is going on there and in ""South Ossetia"". Ethnic cleansing is part of policy of local government, it is encoureged and supported by ""Older brother"" from north.

4711233,4,B005J4TLRU,"It is difficult to make a movie that doesn't concern the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq or terrorism.
It takes courage because you don't know if people will be interested in something that are
not in the news all the time and has a big action hero or production behind it. Hell, this movie
only has AKs!
Still, ""5 Days of War"" tries to do exactly that. Tries to show us about international politics of
another kind, where the good guys are not necessarily what we call ""westerners"" and the bad guys
are as white as we are.
Using recognized Hollywood actors like Andy Garcia, Val Kilmer and Rupert Friend (of Homeland fame),
the people who made this movie managed to attract our attention and recounts the events of the Russian
invasion of Georgia of 2008. Of course there is a strong anti Russian propaganda element in the movie,
but being direct about the subjects that this movie stands for, makes an even greater impression.
The movie reminds us that there are many wars out there with enough suffering and brutality, that we
are not interested in because they do not sell (this subject is evident in the story as no network buys footage
about this war). The plot is simple and remind us of movies of the past, but again that is exactly the
power of the movie. It goes beyond the fictional story and focuses more on the themes and the messages
that are conveyed, bringing our brain right there in front of things we do not think all that often
The good acting by the cast helps a little too, since analogous movies of the past have failed because of
really bad acting and really bad special effects. Even the combat scenes are quite interesting and ""rich"" enough to
include Hind helicopters.
This movie does not have a happy end. No it is not a spoiler. Just remember this at the end of the movie when
some people will talk to you directly.",1472169600,,1838,4.48955223880597

It is the Georgian government under Mikheil Saakashvili,who is nothing but a western puppet and a sycophant  now rightly branded as a criminal, attacked the two autonomous provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, not the other way around. Russian force used force to repel the Georgian Military, because those two autonomous provinces where under the protection of Russia. Read some scholarly articles you will know why that incident happened in the first place (NATO expansion and the back-stabbing of the West). Too bad American public is fooled everyday by CNN,Fox news and others, just like this movie. Just watch this clip from the mendacious and prevaricating FOX news itself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3AFbmV6FDk. See how that guy cuts the audience from expressing their views.

I don't use spoiler alerts in my reviews but this film covers all sides of war. You will not only see both sides of the warring parties but also how it effects relationships present and far away. It also shows the difficulty of making others aware, when the powers that be aren't interested. Neither Andy Garcia or Val Kilmer have major roles in this film but all of the actors are convincing in their roles. This film has no room for celebrating because there are no victors here. But there is more than just pain in this film, you will find courage and love and commitment.

4711252,5,B005J4TLRU,"5 Days of War is a film that was released in Georgia as 5 Days of August. It is a fast-paced action film by Finnish director Renny Harlin which will have you at the edge of your seat within the first two minutes. It is a true portrayal of the Russia / Georgia war and the Battle of Gori and other conflict in the area of South Ossetia.

This film, as an action movie has all of the elements to keep you engaged and ""entertained"", yet what we are seeing on the screen really happened and not too long ago as this film is based on true fact. The casualties of this war left over 100,000 people displaced to this day and hundreds of innocent civilians killed. We witness the gore, the blood, the terror and the tragedy first hand through the eyes of non-combatant journalists and this film sees the coverage of war from a completely different perspective. That over 500 journalists have died trying to bring us the truth of the effects of war is tragic. It is also true that because of the timing of this war and international attention on the 2008 Olympics, there was international apathy and very little coverage at all, yet what we witness is atrocious and heart-breaking. The United States and European Nations should have stepped in sooner. Such incidents of brutality are happening all over the globe and this film shows how fast it can happen and become ""real"". The actors did a wonderful job portraying their characters and it was nice to see an international cast working together on this film.

For whatever reason, many of the reviews on this film are negative but when you actually read them you see that they are based on personal politics and not this film. It is interesting to learn that filming began in October of 2009 in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia and it took 36 days with a budget of only 12 million dollars. Tragically (almost as tragic as most of the world not even being aware that this war took place) is that 5 Days of War was opened in limited release in the US on August 19, 2011 in only two theatres in New York City and Washington D.C. and it grossed a pathetic $6,254 in its opening weekend. This film deserves so much more attention than it has received, as much as what happened in Georgia needs to be known by the entire world. The film closes with several of the real victims of the film speaking about their lost family members. Heartbreaking.",1422057600,,2380,4.468965517241379

4711255,5,B005J4TLRU,"My son and daughter-in-law who live in Georgia say that Georgians are very proud of this movie and that it does certainly portray the world as they see it and how they want the West to understand it. It is a great movie if you understand that it gives a good idea of what happened in this war between Republic of Georgia & Russia, again, from the Georgian perspective. It also does a good job of giving the perspective of those non-Georgians who were there concerning the West's reactions, particularly the perception that the United States (gov't & civilian) was too distracted by other world events rather than to pay much attention to Putin's expansion into Georgian territory. Thus, the movie is rife with western moralizing as American movies are so well known for. Still, this movie a treasure trove of insight into the Georgian psyche as well as the Russian mindset per those Russians who participated in the film. Highly recommend this film if you are interesting in Caucasun-Russian history and can watch the movie as an observer of another culture's attempt to passionately portray a portion of their own story rather than getting swallowed up in the story itself and particularly the shallow criticism Americans often do when viewing a foreign film, or any film for that matter.",1420070400,4,1289,4.863636363636363

I know, I know, it's a very important issue; there's presently a war in Ukraine only a few hundred miles from this war a few years ago in Georgia. But here we're talking about a movie and this movie's failure to get the story across to us.  It's a Hollywood movie filled with stereotypical characters, the hard drinking war correspondent, the cruel mercenary leader, the beautiful girl... The narrative is advanced by some cliched devices, speeches on the television in the corner, really bad speeches in the cabinet room, stilted conversation in the torture chamber, miraculous escapes, pounding music, cool military types with calm disciplined hand signals, people in a gun fight shouting, ""We need to get the memory card,""  just in case you hadn't been following the previous four conversations about the memory card.  Here we are now with the car chase.  He's got the memory card.  The memory card.  Get down.  The violin music, the woman screaming silently, the herds of sheep and back to Andy Garcia looking very stern in front of the presidential palace.  Lots of little fires by the side of the road.  The broadcast center.  The memory card.  We've got to find shelter before the ground troops get here.  People gotta see this footage now.  Helicopter blown up.

Aside from the political aspects, the movie is somewhat cheesy but all in all entertaining. The main character is not very likable, Val Kilmer appears in very short stints only and the character is not developed, then there is the cheesy GI Joe Georgian soldier that keeps appearing at critical moments out of nowhere busting windows and saving the day and always seems to win and do the honarable thing against all odds!

The Russians are shown as blood thirsty militia, cruel and unprofessional.

I would not recommend this movie. It's very forgettable.",1348617600,2,824,4.913669064748201
4711319,4,B005J4TLRU,"As others have noted, this has somewhat the feel of a propaganda piece in favor of Georgia.  But the movie does observe at the end that Georgia started the war, which is the conclusion of the EU investigation.  It does not name the ""five European presidents"" standing with Saakashvilli at the end of the war; they were from Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, Estonia, and Latvia according the ""2008 South Ossetia War"" entry in Wikipedia.  All countries with some familiarity with Soviet domination.  At the time, it seemed that Georgia (with the assistance of Bush) was trying to 'tweak' Putin, and that the Georgians got carried away and took it too far.  The rhetoric in this movie rather supports that. However, the EU investigation (see Wikipedia article) found that the Ossetians undertook 'ethnic cleansing' of Georgians during and after the war, and that the Russians failed to stop them; that seems the major plot driver for the movie.  The vehicle of using the reporters to tell the story was very effective, I thought, unlike the reviewer who found it 'tired'.  Given the facts, it seemed plausible.  I thought the action part of the movie was very well done, the acting was good, the story was good, and the political overlay made it seem a bit clunky at times but at the end of the day it was a good story that probably wasn't much further from the truth than many war movies.  However, a British investigation (BBC & Human Rights Watch) found the Georgians had committed 'possible' 'war crimes', which you would not gather from the movie.  The consensus afterwards was that all parties 'over-reacted'.  The Georgians by attacking, the Russians by escalating to a much higher level and invading. All of which tends to happen in wars.

I give it an A for story, action, pacing and drama, and a B/C for history.  Good acting.  Enjoyable if you like this type of movie.  Made all sides 'human'.  Had dramatic tension.  Seemed ""Real"". Had a viewpoint. Not perfect, but gripping. Emotionally involving.",1346198400,,2002,4.841176470588235
4711320,4,B005J4TLRU,"This film definitely favored Georgia, making it look like Russia attacked them first, for no reason at all. Anyone that looks into something before they type would know this  is not correct but it was still a good film. To me, what was more important was the showing of how civilians get caught up in the middle of wars started by governments and end up paying the price for something that they had no part in. Most everyone alive wants to go about their daily routine of living without having bombs dropped on their heads or mercenaries machine gunning them while hiding in basements. People don't want to be driven from their homes. People don't want their lives thrown into such chaos. It also shows the crimes against humanity that still take place today and have for thousands of years past. A good example, for me, is the 9-11 attacks on our country. It literally brought this country to a stand still for a week and ruined countless lives of not just the dead but their families. Now, imagine our military budget being cut to ribbons, over half of the fighting force of this country completely gone and one of the other ""super power"" countries deciding this is the perfect time to attack America. Would you want that to be us for even one minute? We all forget just how good we have it in this country. We go to work, we take vacations without having to show ""our papers"" to border guards to go from state to state, we don't live in fear that someone will kick down the front door and haul us off because we don't agree with the current government. No one is flying over your town to bomb it night and day, our streets aren't filled with armed soldiers. Unfortunately, the way things are headed, that could become a reality for us some day in the not too distant future. Movies like this remind me just how precious life is and how we, as Americans, still need to fight as hard as we can to keep it that way. I feel so very sorry for all the countries that have to deal with that on a daily basis but I don't want to be them. So, no, the film is not historically accurate. Try and watch it as an ""It Could Happen to Us"" film instead and then do some serious thinking afterward.",1345766400,,2184,4.352941176470588

4711342,3,B005J4TLRU,"If you actually want to know how this war went down, look to a neutral source. I'd suggest German news which had fairly unbiased coverage of the war. Georgian news crews actually filmed the wars opening artillery barrage, which was fired by Georgian multiple rocket launcher systems, not Russian tanks. Georgia's President gambled that either the Russians wouldn't respond to his tough guy act, or the United States would prevent them from making a serious military response. He lost both bets. As entertainment the movie was ok, but it was as historically inaccurate as a movie that depicted the poles starting WWII by attacking a German border checkpoint.",1333497600,4,657,5.092592592592593

This film is packed with many effects that give the viewer a sense of war. However, this film was funded by the United States and Georgia to create propaganda. I see that reviewer `Muffin Man' made some interesting remarks and is buying into this propaganda. The fact of the matter is that Georgia started shelling South Ossetia, which has been a breakaway region for over 15 years. This of course prompted a response from the Russians. Why wouldn't Russia respond back? You have to do your research before watching this film and don't be so gullible on what you gather from this film.",1331942400,,691,4.7190082644628095

Val Kilmer has about 30 seconds of screen time and is of little import to the movie. The acting is good and the script is ok but again, the theme has been done on several occasions so you may want to think about laying out the coin for a purchase as honestly the movie will ultimately be very forgettable.",1326758400,,469,4.164835164835165

4711349,3,B005J4TLRU,"Another political/war movie from the late summer of '11, that was in limited release, but went straight to video where they probably always intended it, is ""5 Days of War"". It's about the Russian invasion that happened in '08. You remember that, right? The Russians invaded the small country of Georgia because they were supposedly bothering the small area of people inside that country called South Ossetia? At the time the Presidential campaign was going on and McCain said he wanted to go to war there? Yeah, right. Well that kind of international disinterest is just what the reporters in this story have to deal with as they're running from the invading army of Causac mercenaries while trying to get the atrocities they videoed out to the rest of a world, more interested in American Idol and the Olympics. The movie isn't really as interesting a story about modern journalism and war as it could be, but for what was basically a limited release intended mostly for video, they really didn't skimp on the location work and the military hardware on display - and the pyrotechnics. Lot's of stuff blows up in this. This movie really kinda' plays like a video game - in fact it surprises me nobody has tried to make it into one. The reporters are running from the army, trying to get incriminating footage, trying to get refugees to safety and trying to get the footage they've recorded on a video card somewhere where it can be uploaded for broadcast. It almost makes you look around your living room for the game controller. The action's too spectacular to take the movie as a serious rendition of what happened and a few of the characters and situations seem a little stock - two of the Causac ""villains"" seem like they should be in a James Bond movie. Still though, I like it sometimes when movies ""encapsulate"" events like this into a form that seems to have lots of ""bits"" that one can leap off into the actual, real aspects of it - if one wants to then go and read up more on the subject. I guess they felt they had to up the action aspect of it to still get people interested in this subject. It's an interesting movie that'll have to do until somebody else can make a more relevant rendition of this event.",1326067200,3,2218,4.56140350877193

The movie has a couple of slow spots, but if you hang in there, you will be glad you did.  Be warned that there is some war-related gore involved, but it's a WAR movie.  Noteworthy performances from Andy Garcia as the President of Georgia, Johnathon Schaech as a Georgian soldier and, finally, the actor who played the role of the young Russian(?) mercenary.
