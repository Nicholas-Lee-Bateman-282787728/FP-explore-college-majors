7064346,4,B00UO4Q2LI,"GIANT CLAWS (aka: ISLAND CLAWS) is about a laboratory that is developing enlarged, faster-growing seafood. Oh no! An accident has occurred at a nearby nuclear power plant! Photojournalist, Jan Raines (Jo McDonnell) is doing a story on the lab, and her dad just happens to run the power plant! Shockingly, TV news reports inform us that the accident was far worse than originally thought! Meanwhile, the hermit crab races are on, and the sweaty drunks dance a jig, down at Moody's (Robert Lansing- THE 4-D MAN, EMPIRE OF THE ANTS) bar. Interspersed  throughout, are scenes of crabs roaming around on a beach, in a similar way to the footage of the not-so-menacing toads hopping along in the movie FROGS. Once night falls, the horror begins, when a bunch of cranky crustaceans invade the renovated bus-home of a local banjo player. His bus is a raging inferno in no time! The next day, Jan barely escapes a crab roadblock, almost getting her toes pinched in the melee! Then, she and her boyfriend discover a gigantic crab shell! When they take the shell back to the lab, no one seems to see any possible downside to their find. More people are attacked, and the town morons grab their guns and clubs, convinced that a group of Haitian ""boat people"" are to blame. Of course, by now we know the terrible truth! All evidence points to a marauding, monster crab, especially after it tears down Moody's house! Can this cantankerous creature be stopped, before the whole town is destroyed?! Compared to other movies featuring giant crabs, like ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS and MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, GIANT CLAWS is somewhere in between. The final battle is a crab-tastic crab-tacular!...  EXTRA POINTS- If you can tell which part of Ireland is represented by Robert Lansing's ""accent""...",1502668800,7,1774,4.8903654485049834
7064347,3,B00UO4Q2LI,"This movie has all the makings of a fun ""so bad it's good"" type adventure. Unfortunately, the nighttime scenes are excessively dark (and about 50% of this movie takes place during nights). Perhaps in the future, someone like Arrow Video or Shout Factory will release a remastered bluray print of this film, correcting the darkness issue, but currently this Amazon streaming version is far too dark to enjoy.",1502409600,4,407,5.0

7064349,4,B00UO4Q2LI,"I remember watching this cheesy, corny movie back when I was a kid. I was able to get a dvd bootleg a year or so ago, and yeah, it's just like I remember. Still though, it's a fun movie for killer animal fans. Minimal blood and violence, so the kiddies can watch it.",1458345600,5,266,4.037735849056604
7064350,1,B00UO4Q2LI,"Like other movies I have purchased and reviewed, ""Island Claws"" was part of USA's Saturday Nightmares.  I basically have been trying to collect as many of the movies that were featured on that block's line-up.  Featured were edited versions of ""Nightmare on Elm St. 1, 2, and 3"", ""Friday the 13th 1, 2 and 3"", Halloween 1 and 2"", ""Basket Case"", ""Of Unknown Origin"", ""The Unseen"", ""Piranha"", It's Alive and It Lives Again"", ""Uninvited"", ""Day of the Animals"", ""Mako, Jaws of Death"", Demoniod"", this one and several others I don't remember the titles of.

This movie is FINALLY on DVD but the quality is poor.  I could easily tell this was from a VHS transfer.  The picture is dark and grainy and sound quality fair.  Granted this is not a beloved cinema classic so I didn't expect it to be great.  If you can overlook the flaws and want this movie, buy it at your own risk.",1446508800,7,871,4.509554140127388

This is not the movie ""Giant Claw 1947""

8707715,3,B00UO4Q2LI,"AKA Island Claws

A Nuclear Plant has a boo-boo resulting in an over-sized roaring crab that likes to eat cute girls and little dogs.

Can the locals find and dispatch it?
First, they have to believe that all the creepy accidents are not creepy accidents.

The major drawback is the dark filming that leaves you wondering what you are supposed to be looking at in the almost black screen.

Filming Location: Virgina Key, Florida, USA
Virginia Key is an 863-acre (3.49 km 2) barrier island in Miami, Florida, United States in Biscayne Bay, south of Brickell and north of Key Biscayne.",1505952000,,583,4.742574257425742

8707717,4,B00UO4Q2LI,"Robert Lansing with a not so hot Irish brogue, priceless.  Other than the lousy lighting in several scenes, it's not a bad ole flick seriously I'm giving it a four star for the good laughs I got out of the film.  The acting is what one would expect from a b film.  I thought the little crabs in the film were an amusing touch with big brother crab rounding things out towards the end.  If you want something which is older, (this one's from the eighties, not the forties by the way) genuinely funny at times with assorted colorful, boozing locals and some Haitian boat people thrown in for good measure:  This film should fit your bill.  There's no profanity, no real violence, (other than the big crab pinching a few folks to death) no sex, etc. in other words it's a family film, or party film take your pick.  I had a few brews, watched with some popcorn and laughed my head off at certain points.  So by all means watch it and enjoy!",1505174400,3,937,4.314285714285714

8707719,2,B00UO4Q2LI,"This film is misidentified on Amazon Prime as being from 1949.  It is actually a 1980 schlock horror film where the cast appears to have been selected for being blonde rather than acting ability or suitability for their roles.  Even the veteran character actors such as husky-voiced Nita Talbot (Anita Sokol) show poorly in this film.  She is often cast as a stereotypical Jewish New Yorker because of her accent, but here she's asked to try a Southern accent and fails miserably.  Yet she does a better job at that than Robert Lansing does with whatever sort of accent he's attempting (Irish?).  Add in the poor lighting and almost non-existent special effects budget, and you have an hour-and-a-half of poorly acted, largely unsympathetic characters behaving stupidly and providing little in the way of suspense, action or anything else that grabs your attention.  It's no wonder that this is Writer-Director-Producer Hernan Cardenas' only film.",1504310400,4,947,5.1568627450980395
