8025675,5,B0002BLHH2,"I wasn't sure whether I would order this originally as I didn't know what sort of movie it was - romance by the description but with grim pictures on the cover including a guy in sunglasses that could have been a thug.
I found out sunglasses was a 'cool' look and this is a romance- nothing dark in it really. It's not a deep movie as its not in that genre: it is more a romance movie.
I found it entertaining and generally good Bollywood fare. It is generally well acted but is very much Aishwaryia's film (though the men who played the fathers in the movie are very solid too)
What lifted it is the soundtrack by A.A. Rahman. If you don't know your Bollywood, he tends to write a different sort of soundtrack (as in Lagaan and Jodha Akbar)- much more evocative often and more heavily orchestrated. He also writes catchy melodies within that. There is a good mix of both those here. A lot of effort has been put into the dance sequences too in a very effective way.
This movie won awards in its time but was made in 1999. I find a lot of the movies prior to 2000 can look dated by now. Not so with Taal - good modern photography.
It is sort of a 4 star movie but the music and dance lift it to a 5 for me. Recommended for those liking the romantic genre or good music or good dance sequences.",1229558400,,1293,4.155378486055777
8025676,5,B0002BLHH2,"This was a purchase that my mom wanted.  I wasn't real sure that I would like this movie, but I was wrong.  I did have to warm up to it though.  I watched it twice before I realised how much I enjoyed the movie and the music.  I do think it is worth the purchase.",1195603200,,263,3.727272727272727
8025677,5,B0002BLHH2,"This film sports a stellar cast and a few enjoyable jokes, but that is not what makes this film worth watching. What really captures in the film is the music, the beat, the taal (hindi for rhythm). Also, the cinematography is stunning, especially during some of the songs. Aishwariya is also very stunning, and some of you gentlemen will find your eyes straying towards her in whatever scene she's in! Anil Kapoor is the source of most of the laughs, with his zippy, zealous performance that never goes overboard. Akshay Khanna is good, but he has acted much better in some other films, including Dil Chatha Hai. Overall, a worthy watch.",1152576000,,637,4.747747747747748
8025678,5,B0002BLHH2,I loved this movie. Aishwarya plays a country girl who falls for the rich boy from the city. Rich family against their love. The the songs are beautiful and I enjoyed watching the movie. It is a great movie to watch and time will not matter when you are watching a good movie.,1145404800,2,276,4.226415094339623
8025679,5,B0002BLHH2,"Taal is almost two movies in one, its two halves linked together by love.  What begins in the scenic, provincial setting of Chamba ends in the boisterous city of Bombay.  In some ways, it is a conventional love story involving that most star-crossed of romances, one between a wealthy young man and a poor young woman, and all the necessary complications such a love gives rise to.  In Bollywood, though, nothing is ever simple - and the whole atmosphere of this film swings ponderously between beginning and end.

Akshaye Khanna plays Manav Mehta, a well-bred young man who comes to India with his fantastically wealthy father and quickly falls in love with Mansi (Aishwarya Rai), the daughter of a local folk singer named Tarababu.  How could he not fall for the most beautiful girl in the world?  She, her father's only child, resists Manav's affection, afraid to give her heart to a man of such wealth.  She is right to fear that Manav's family will not accept a poor girl such as herself (especially his aunt - aunts always seem to pose a major problem for romances in India).  She does love Manav, though, and he pledges his everlasting love before accompanying his family back to Bombay.  Manav's father had treated Tarababu as a brother in Chamba, but such high regards for the folk singer disappear when Tarababu takes Mansi to be with Manav in Bombay.  Mutual insults are exchanged between the two families, and Manav himself sends Mansi away.  The love affair looks to be dead and gone at this point, but then Manav learns how his family had dishonored Tarababu when he arrived.  Although Mansi wants nothing to do with him, Manav not only renews his pledge of love to her, he remains steadfast in the belief that she will come to him eventually.

Meanwhile, Tarababu and Mansi have been welcomed by Vikrant Kapoor (Anil Kapoor), a famous musician and TV producer who has made all kinds of money remixing the songs of Tarababu.  Vikrant takes the simple girl and transforms her into an international singing star - and, as you might expect, falls in love with Mansi.  Manav, still confident in his love, shows up from time to time but seems to have lost Mansi forever - yet he still manages to prove his love in the most simple but daring of ways.  Herein lies the power of true love; it has the ability to change not only the souls of two lovers, but also the hearts of those around them.  A lot of things happen as the story progresses towards its end, leaving Mansi to make the difficult choice of whom she will be with in the film's climactic finish.

Naturally, there are a number of wonderful songs scattered throughout the film, and the movie showcases Rai's beauty across the whole spectrum from young, simple village girl to mega-glamorous international superstar.  The whole superstardom thing tends to make the second half of the film a little overblown (and the costumes worn by Vikrant's dancing troupes are just horrible), and I think that takes a way a little bit from the beauty of the film's romance, but the simple truths of this story still shine through.  It's a wonderful love story told as only Bollywood can tell it.",1130025600,11,3150,4.682395644283122
8025680,4,B0002BLHH2,"I'm not Indian. I don't speak Hindi. This was my first Bollywood flick (although I'd seen ""music videos"" of Bollywood numbers on tv over the years and enjoyed them). I loved the movie (although the ending seemed to drag on and on and I was ready for a resolution 30 mins before it finished. The beginning and middle are great--Aish Rai is amazing, clearly, one of the loveliest women to ever walk the earth. Graceful and just stunning. The leading man is handsome, though not nearly as charismatic as  Aish. The second guy is quite good--some comic relief and just rather fun.

The story:  It's a love story. Boy meets talented country girl. Boy's family is rude to venerable father of country girl, causing boy to rashly blame girl and kin. Girl stalks off to meet record producer and become great singing sensation. Boy realizes he was wrong and is all achey about it, but knows the girl will be his. It's destiny, ya know?  Eventually, girl IS his. Happy Ending. Yay!

The cinematography is lovely. The music is OUTSTANDING. (I found a phonetic site with the words, and I got the soundtrack as a birthday present, and this CD rocks!) The idea of loyalty to family and everlasting true love are staples of Bollywood (and I'm a sucker for both, coming from a big Latin family where you respected mom and dad and didn't dishonor your kin; and being married to the sweetest dollface on the planet.) Yes, I'm a hopeful romantic.

So, if for nothing else, rent this to 1. See pretty picture! 2. See prettier Aishwarya Rai! 3. Hear pretty, pretty music! 4. See happy lovey-dovey ending.

Someone criticized Aish's crying in a previous review. Well, if I looked THAT good when I cried, shoot, I might cry more often. The big number of ""Ishq Bina"" with the tears and all was faboo.

If you've never seen a Bollywood flick, this is a nice place to start.

Now, if only they could make the movies tighter/shorter.
