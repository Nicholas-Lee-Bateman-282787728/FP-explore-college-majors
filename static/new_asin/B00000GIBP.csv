8363187,5,B00000GIBP,"This is truly one of the best anime series ever made!  Lodoss War has been described as a ""Dungeon and Dragon"" style anime epic adventure.  The six-volume series contains 13 half-hour episodes. Classic good verses evil throughout the series, with romance and humor mixed in quite nicely.  If you like the Slayers series, you should definitely get the Lodoss War series!",971481600,,369,5.016393442622951
