5124378,5,B0083713HG,"I came across this yoga dvd after someone on a mommy forum had posted a link to an excerpt of it online.  I did the online routine for a week and I loved it so much that I decided to purchase the DVD itself.  I wanted to be able to watch it anytime.  I had tried a prenatal yoga dvd by Jennifer Wolfe and it was too intense, repetitive, and fast-moving for my pregnant body.  Lara Dutta's routine has managed to be just the right balance of movement and rest, stretching and relaxation.  There are a variety of poses and you really feel grounded and relaxed after the session.  Plus, the whole routine is just a half-hour long--perfect for fitting into my day.  The tone of the DVD is encouraging and informative, letting you know just why a certain move is beneficial during pregnancy.  I can't wait to start the meditations.  All in all, I highly recommend this DVD.  Enjoy!!",1349827200,5,877,4.425

8524337,2,B0083713HG,"I expected a little more content. Hardly 45 mins of content. Since I already know yoga & pilates, I did not find this useful.",1438128000,,125,4.25
8524338,5,B0083713HG,"I think that this is an excellent yoga DVD. I love how Lara Dutta has presented it, the camera angles and her narration of each pose make the video very easy to follow and understand. I love her accent, it is very clear to understand even for an American ear. The workout leaves me very rejuvenated and happy. I'm in my second trimester. I wish she had a post natal yoga video as well.",1431907200,,385,4.216216216216216
