7826495,5,6302492769,"Thank you so much! I have been looking for this movie for years! It's not the crappy boring Disney version. Those who are complaining, this IS NOT the Disney version. This is Adventures of Little Toot so no it's not the wrong cover art. It is the correct video but it isn't the Disney version. This is a children's version based off the original. It's a great movie to own.",1447027200,,373,4.3428571428571425

7826497,4,6302492769,"I love the original Disney classic.

But this review is more of a head's up - the cover art is NOT accurate. It's from a completely different movie from 1992.",1359936000,,158,4.266666666666667
