7808621,3,6300983439,"This is a British movie that came out a year before THE OMEN. Like that movie, there is a baby that is possessed by evil. This baby also begins killing everyone around it in stealth, or at least attacking them. This movie was made with a zilcho budget, probably the most expensive part was hiring Joan Collins. It's worth it just to see some gratuitous shots of her mostly naked. Donald Pleasance also stars and does a good job as a doctor, and then he too is killed by the demon child. No great action scenes or fancy special effects but the film does have couple of bloody horror moments.",1285459200,,590,4.372727272727273
