797321,5,630416923X,"This video boxset is worth every penney. It manages to last the time captivating you until the last chords of the final song in the set. The surviving members, accompanied by George Martin and Neil Aspinall give  honest and often humourous accounts of their years as 'the Fab Four' and  musical interludes bring the feeling of nostalgia. There is something here  for any body who has a passing interest in the group. The pop video for  'Free as a Bird' is a masterpiece.",918518400,,470,4.626506024096385

If you are a Beatles fan, you will want to own it. You won't be disappointed. There is a little game you can play while watching the 'Free as a Bird' video.

This is the closest you will get to experiencing The Beatles in concert, live, and in person with all the cool interviews!

I found it to be incredibly honest when it came to the relationships within the band and the events that eventually lead to the breakup. I do find Paul to be a bit egotistical and rather bossy at times. He's quick to distance himself from the band's failures like the 'Magical Mystery Tour'. It's clear in old interviews with John that he was rather annoyed with a lot of this, as was George, who I find to be the most upfront, honest and to-the-point of the four. Definitely check it out if you're a music buff and a Beatles fan. Great documentary.",1493337600,,648,4.547008547008547

What a treasure. Many of these tracks remind me of wasted days and wasted nights in the smokey pubs and clubs of London before these funky scouses  became 'really popular'. Would love to give it 5+ or 9+ except for one thing. Kudos to Derek Taylor, are you still alive, for his involvement and 'liner notes' but they were pretty whitebread. Would be cool if all those survivors who had a personal connection to these recordings could reminisce before golden slumbers kiss your eyes.
It's The Journey - Not The Destination.

797988,1,630416923X,"The one star is for the appalling manufacturing quality of the discs in the USA made NTSC boxed set of ""Beatles Anthology"" DVDs. I purchased 2 of these sets at the same time from Amazon in June 2008 - one for myself, the other as a gift for my brother. I watched them at the time and they worked properly, but on 23rd October 2016 when I tried to watch them again I found that the first two of the 5 discs discs could no longer be recognised as a working DVD by any of my players - or by my PC. The next two discs would start to play, but the data was unreadable after a short while. Only the 5th disc plays OK. My brother brought over his set for me to compare, and his are just as faulty. A close examination of the surface of the discs reveals that the cause of the problem is that they have ""delaminated"" significantly (the adhesive bonding the layers of these dual-layer discs has failed - allowing a gap which stops the laser from being able to read the data). This means that this batch of discs has been manufactured with very poor quality control. I assume that this problem would affect all the discs made in that same pressing run - and that could mean that there are thousands more customers - especially in the USA - who will one day be shocked to find that their Beatles Anthology DVD's are now useless for anything other than beer coasters. The Capitol label should be obliged to replace all of them.",1477180800,19,1415,4.2444444444444445

Felt to me like at least 50% could be edited out, perfect stuff to include on a bonus disc but not in the main narrative. Maybe this is meant for the superfan who wants to know all of the itty bitty nitty gritty and can stand the snails pace and repetition, but personally I give it two thumbs down.",1473379200,,516,4.329896907216495

798093,5,630416923X,"This should be unlimited stars!!! I saw this on TV many years ago (around 1992 or 1993) and loved it. I am a forever Beatles fan, saw them in person in Seattle in 1966 (didn't hear them because of all the screaming) and have all of their albums and CDs. I also have this set on VHS but that doesn't do me much good because as we all know, VHS is the old way and the tapes wear out or break. I received this collection last week and have already watched all but one DVD. It took me back to simpler days when I was a lovestruck preteen and early teenager with the biggest crush on George Harrison! I'm going to admit this here, I still have a crush on him, even after all these years :-) Hard to believe he's been gone almost 15 years and John since 1980. This set is very comprehensive, there is footage of their concerts, press and news footage, Ed Sullivan shows, rehearsing, singing, personal insights, comic moments, etc. I could go on and on, but this set has it all for any Beatles fan. You will learn things you never knew about them, laugh with them over things you've already seen, enjoy their music, Paul singing Hey Jude was a big highlight as are all their other songs. They bicker a little bit, George quits, comes back, Ringo quits and comes back, etc. On and on, it's just a great ride through history, as they start with simple songs with just 3 guitars and one set of drums, to Rubber Soul when George introduced the sitar, to Revolver and more complex songs, to Sgt. Pepper's with a full complement or orchestral instruments. They become more socially conscious, grow up before your eyes, and when the final concert happens on the rooftop, you know what's next (the breakup) and you don't want it to happen. At least I didn't. There was never a band like them before and there will never be another band like them. They were the greatest, Lennon and McCartney were geniuses at songwriting and deciding which song fit which Beatle, George comes into his own as a songwriter and he was he best guitar player, Ringo is just happy and smiling and he gets his songs which are simple but he's on key and he seems like he's the most fun of the four. There is a segment of him in Hard Day's Night where he's walking along the beach, makes contact with a young boy, and he explains how he's so hungover from the night before he can hardly handle it! Hilarious! I highly recommend this to any Beatles fan who wants a trip down memory lane with all the quips and info you'll love! Beatles Forever!",1468713600,,2503,4.35042735042735

798501,5,630416923X,"The Beatles Anthology is a documentary series about the history of The Beatles. Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all participated in it.

The documentary used interviews with The Beatles and their associates to narrate the history of the band as seen through archival footage and performances. It is a series first-person accounts by the Beatles themselves, with no external ""objective"" narration. Footage in the Anthology series features voice-over recordings of all four Beatles to push the narrative of the story, with contributions from their producer, road manager and others. As well as telling their story through archival footage, the remaining living Beatles - Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison - appear in interview segments recorded exclusively for the series itself. The late John Lennon appears only in historic archival footage.

It is a must-see for any Beatles fan. No question about it. It gives you new information of on the greatest band that ever performed. Also,it provides rare performances of the Fab Four that have never been seen before. A gem for anyone who likes the British band. Finally,anyone who loves the legendary band could not get enough in this 11-hour documentary.",1430870400,,1230,5.302564102564102

798718,5,630416923X,"This is the best documentary I've ever seen on the Beatles. It's stunning to see and hear the early live performances, when they played in small clubs and modest-sized concert halls (compared to the 55,000+ at the 1965 Shea Stadium concert). Rock'n'roll has come a long ways, and not always for the better. Great for both nostalgic fans as well as turning younger listeners into Beatles fans.

When you listen to the breadth and scale of the Lennon-McCartney songs over the years - especially hearing them sing ""live"" - you realize that no other band even comes close to their brilliant collaboration. For sheer musicology the Beatles are unsurpassed, and this look into their careers, with great background commentaries, shows why.",1416528000,,732,5.049586776859504

I had seen this when it was on ABC back in 1995 and I expected it was the same thing, but there was so much more additional footage that was not shown in the original series. I thought I had seen everything on the Beatles, but there was footage here I had NEVER seen before, and so I was pleasantly surprised. Highly recommend buying this. Great for fans who are barely getting into the Beatles, and those who have been fans for years. The only things I had a bit of a disagreement with were how the death of Stuart Sutcliffe was not touched upon, as it would have been nice if the Beatles had talked about it, and also wish Pete Best and Jimmy Nicol(temporary drummer for a couple of weeks during one of the tours when Ringo was sick) had been interviewed about their time with the band. Would have especially liked to have seen Pete Best interviewed, but I read that he had not been asked, though apparently he probably would have agreed to an interview.",1409616000,14,983,4.406593406593407

798862,5,630416923X,"With this multi-volume set, you get much more than what was originally on the American network television version. Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr provide a fairly accurate, personal account of their years before and during their time as Beatles. John Lennon's recollections are provided through television and radio interviews he gave until the end of his life. Lennon's recollections actually come across as being the most frank and honest, most of which came from his extensive ""Working Class Hero"" interview with Jan Wenner of Rolling Stone in late 1970 when the tension and stresses of the group breakup were still very fresh in his memory. Much credit though has to go to Jools Holland, who conducted the contemporary interviews with McCartney, Harrison, and Starr. Because Holland is also a musician, he was able to achieve a certain level of comfort and trust with the surviving three to drop their guard just enough to talk about some of the more polarizing / controversial aspects of the Beatles, such as drug use, Lennon and Ono's Two Virgins album, and the Philippines / Marcos Incident, are really talked about honestly. The final episode, dealing with the breakup, still doesn't answer all the questions as to why it happened, but you get the impression that, other than McCartney, the other three were ready to move on to other things; It wasn't much fun anymore. The bonus disc material provides the final documented performances of the ""Threetles"" together at George's home on ukuleles and also a short unplugged set. Overall, it's a treasure trove of material; much of it covered in various biographies. But this time it comes from the Beatles themselves. Is it completely honest and forthright? Probably not. But it's probably the closest we will all come to what all of our inquiring minds want to know about the Fab Four in first person narrative.",1402099200,3,1885,5.006369426751593

I'm only 31 and seem to appreciate what this anthology is more so than their original fans. I remember being 13 yrs old and taping this documentary off tv. I can't wait to get paid again so I can buy this. It's just so weird to me how many people just want to hear the music rather than hear the stories behind the people that created it. It's rather sad actually; almost an act of disrespect like showing up to a concert and only sticking around for the number 1 hits rather than the entire show.

And the downside of being a Beatle is talked about and the efforts that did not work.

799193,5,630416923X,"I like how we're going to compare Wagner to the Beatles and The Backstreet Boys. Honestly, I bet the Backstreet Boys have accomplished more than you will ever accomplish while they sat on a toilet. Though, tell me again, which Backstreet Boys song was written by someone in the group? And tell me when did The Beatles claim that they were on any level with Wagner? Pop music is (popular music).  Did you snobs read somewhere that The Beatles claimed to be something besides that?

  What kind of person listens to ""I want to hold your hand"", and sums up the Beatles entire catalog as lyrically weak?! More than a decade of lyrics written and we're gonna criticize the ones written by 18 year olds for TEENAGED girls (in the 60's when you could be banned from radio and investigated for writing ""Wooly Bully"")? Really?Are you kidding?!  I'll tell you what kind of person passes this kind of judgement... A narcissistic, elitist! My favorite kind of person.

  ""Yeah, big deal.  I know so many better bands than the most popular band in the world. They just don't get the recognition of that lousy Beatles band. If everyone listened to my opinion, we'd live in a better world. The underground band I'm thinking of has better lyrics, production, arrangement and charm."" (should be read with a low, monotonous, elite tone)

  People who insist that The Beatles were sell-outs, clearly don't fathom the concept! They were in the music BUSINESS. That's a business that sells its art (designated specifically for a large audience). Popular! Yes you observed correctly that The Beatles aimed their music toward the masses just like the Backstreet Boys. (ooh, that's disgusting) Then they gradually introduced ideas that were more inspired and textured.

  Truly, if you want to hear the most atonal music that's deep and inspired, just hang out in your room with your didgeridoo or play your viola to your friends who hate everything besides Classical. That way you will never sell out and snobs like yourselves won't ever be able to criticize you, since you're too awesome to sell your music to the idiot masses. You can keep all of your artistic integrity to yourselves and the rest of us won't have to pretend that we're impressed. (because, I assure you, we're not)

  The Beatles were a group of guys that set out to conquer the world with their ""primitive"" music. So my hat is off to them, because, while people like YOU will always be there to act elite and pretend that you don't like what is OBVIOUSLY good art, people like them will laugh at how they're STILL more important than you and your posturing, will ever live to be. Furthermore, the rest of the people who can admit that something popular is good, will just enjoy the music for what it is; Well written, melodic, simple stuff. (executed in such a way that it is impossible to replicate by people like you)

  I promise you could not play even one of their early songs correctly with whatever group you assemble, (especially musicians who aren't ""amateurs"") and what's more, you could never get one of your AWESOME, COMPLEX arrangements with inspired lyrics, to a number one position on the charts. I know you would never attempt any of this because it's beneath you. You don't have to prove anything to me or the world. Your art is deep and meaningful without ANY need for validation. (or, infinitely more likely, you have no talent at all).  And finally, let's see whose songs stand the test of time in terms of being discussed by musician's and fans alike for years to come: Yours or The Beatles. I'm sure I'll be eating my words 50 years from now because I'm just another stupid Beatles fan, but my money's on The Beatles.

  Your opinion is good for only one thing, and that's irritating people who know better. Elite people bore us all. You're too cool. You're not impressed. Trust me, it goes both ways. Just because you present your snobbish, knowledge of musical masters of the past, doesn't make you interesting. If you can show us something YOU'VE created that could hold a candle to The Beatles, we would be impressed. Instead you just show us that you can stand up in the face of popularity and say, ""meh"".  Wow!  What a contribution!  What a fool I was, enjoying this band. I'm ashamed of myself now that this superior intellect came along and wizened me up!

  In short, people who hate The Beatles on the Internet are more interesting than The Beatles themselves. Being popular and selling your merchandise is cheesy and if most people love someone's art  than those people are idiots for all that this entails. You should never go for your potential, just stay in front of your computer and talk down on successful people. That way you will NEVER have to fail. Hate a popular thing on the basis of its popularity. Pretend it sounds dated. (it was recorded in the 60's and was definitely a product of the time) Add nothing to the world except your baseless criticism. What a legacy... Now I've summed up your whole career in this paragraph. Isn't that fair?

  However you slice it you're a couple of idiots and I'm glad to see that you're outnumbered by a HUGE margin of fans that love a great band (with or without the use of drugs).  And I'm an idiot for even wasting my time, trying to explain things to elitists. Possibly the lowest life form on earth.

  By the way, this set is amazing and is a must for those who want to learn about how a great band worked hard and achieved the goals that they set out to conquer. And no amount of elitist activity will take that away from them!",1376265600,,5564,4.615853658536586

Now that I have decided to replace this masterpiece collection with DVDs, however, I feel the need to watch the Fab Four sing ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""I Am the Walrus"" on screen again.

I remember all the ""scandals"" and all the hype (that I never believed) that surrounded them (Paul is dead, they ignore royalty (Imelda Marcos, etc. - Please!?!).
The quality of the DVDs is good and they are informative. I wasn't aware of the anthology until my 32 year-old daughter mentioned it on a phone call (she was watching them with a roommate), and I immediately went to Amazon and found and purchased it. Like I say, they were two full days to watch, but were edited well and not at all boring. I did learn about the Beatles  history prior to their Ed Sullivan show appearance, which surprised me they had been together (and with other band members, too) for a lot longer than I had realized.

799306,4,630416923X,"First things first: it is an amazing documentary that was detailed and held interest despite its epic length.

I enjoyed the DVD and liked the interviews, although bringing in other members of the Beatles circle beside Derek Taylor and Neil Aspinall would have been useful. Engineers like Norman Smith, fellow Merseybeat group members who hanged out with the group (part of Brian Epstein's stable of stars), original Cavern audience members, family members of the group (especially Lennon's family, as he had several nieces and nephews who could have led some insight into a man who obviously could not be interviewed for this series), and even their spouses at the time would have added insight into the group.

Second, I wished they did not have the Beatles ""talking over"" during the videos and performances, notably ""Hey Jude"" and ""Rain"" and ""Day Tripper."" In fact, the Hey Jude film takes off the David Frost introduction and further cuts the ending by a few minutes.

I also thought the DVD extras would include things like unavailable televised specials like ""The Music of Lennon and McCartney,"" ""Around the Beatles,"" and other specials for collectors and fans. Or, the complete televised concerts like the ones in Japan, Germany, and Australia, or the Shea Stadium concert, where the music can do the talking. I would have preferred their ""Ready Steady Go"" appearances in place of the Threetles discussing their career. Having the surviving Beatles commiserate and discuss their career was revelatory (I am sorry but Harrison seemed very uncomfortable around McCartney and they even seemed testy at points) but that could have been one of the many extras.

Lastly, a small section on their solo careers should have taken some of the last section.

I found it jarring how George Harrison's hair was long in one interview, mustache in one, long hair and beard in another, clean shaven, then mustache. Did he get bored with his hair or something?

Overall though, it IS the Beatles. This is the best documentary on a rock group ever. I pray the Rolling Stones for 50 years could someday get an ""Anthology style"" treatment as good as the 8 year recording career of the Beatles.",1365552000,,2180,4.958904109589041

After watching the newer George Harrison documentary, I decided to give this one another look, and I'm glad I did. This set is even more special when you remember that George left us less than ten years after it was produced. The stories they tell are interesting, as well as the fact that they don't all remember things the same way (especially funny is the fact that Paul says he doesn't want to take credit for the creation of Magical Mystery Tour).
I bought this set used, and all the DVDs played fine except in one spot: at the end of the segment about Brian Epstein's death, a picture of Epstein appears on the screen along with his years of birth and death. My DVD stops dead in that spot. At first I thought it was dramatic effect, but it went on for too long, and I had to restart the disc again to go on to the next segment. Very strange and spooky.
I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a Beatle fan, or even those who just like history or are curious about the '60s.

I'm a huge Beatle fan,  so I devour most everything on the subject.  Quality was great, price was right,  shipping was very quick...who could ask for more?",1349740800,,288,4.4423076923076925
799618,5,630416923X,"The following is a reprint of my 2003 review of the DVD set which had just then recently been released.

Back in January 2000, I reviewed this box set here (see ""If You Liked the TV Special, You'll Love This!""). 3 years later, many Beatles fans' prayers (including my own) were answered with the release of this video library in DVD form. Rather than resay what I said back then, I just thought I'd write with a different perspective. The opening statement is from the liner notes of Derek Taylor, who served as the Beatles' press agent.

To answer a recent review, here's what's on it: performances of the Beatles live in concert and television performances (not complete concerts), some original videos, narrated by Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, the late George Harrison (who was still around during the making of this documentary) and the late John Lennon (his comments are culled by old interviews), excerpts from early recordings, studio outtakes, press conferences and all 5 of their movies and finally, over 30 complete Beatles tracks (By the way, ""Real Love"" is included in this edition).

The sound quality is superior here than the original VHS (and you have the option of LPCM Stereo, Dolby Digital surround sound and DTS 5.1 surround sound). You also have the option of subtitles in English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese (Brazilian and European). Just don't expect your Linguistics teachers to be impressed with how many French or Spanish words you learned while watching this!

It is a bit of a shame that individual tracks weren't assembled for complete songs. Oh well, a minor disappointment! Keep in mind that the 8 video VHS box set was actually pricier than the 5 DVD box set back when it was released in 1996 (I remember paying nearly double for mine!).

Then of course, there's the Special Features DVD. In addition to the ""Real Love"" video (which wasn't included on the original VHS edition), there's a segment in which Paul, George and Ringo all gather together in 1994 to discuss the old days and jam out on old songs. The 3 are also featured here in 1995 discussing with George Martin, their producer, the choosing of different outtakes on the 3 Anthology CD's and studio techniques they used during the original recording sessions. Paul, George and Ringo also discuss with Jeff Lynne how a Beatles mini-""reunion"" took place with 2 John Lennon demos (""Free As a Bird"" and ""Real Love""). Also, there's a section on how many hours of interviews and classic footage came together for this documentary and a feature on how the ""Free as a Bird"" video was made.

Give yourself at least 2 weeks to enjoy as the late Derek Taylor once put it these ""10 hours of unchallengable evidence"" of the Beatles' legacy, which continues even to this day.

Note: While I'm not sure a Blu-Ray release is in the planning, it would be cool to see. They could include the ""director's cut"" and commentary from all who participated (and are still alive to tell).",1346544000,,2982,4.8011695906432745

My only complaint about this series is the fact that squashed the White Album, Let It Be, and Abbey Road all into one episode.

799622,4,630416923X,"Originally produced for television broadcast in 1995, THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY is a 10-episode, 11-hour documentary film covering the whole history of the Beatles from their childhood in 1950s Liverpool to their breakup in 1969. The three Beatles alive at the time -- Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr -- recount their memories to unheard and offscreen interviewers. John Lennon is represented by audio from the many interviews he made when he was alive. In addition, producer George Martin, assistant Neil Aspinall and press officer Derek Taylor are interviewed. There is abundant archive footage of concerts, television performances, promo videos and news appearances.

This documentary assumes some basic prior knowledge of the Beatles; one should know the albums they put out and in what order, and vaguely what hit songs are on which. One should know that Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best were members of the band in the very early days. But that's it really, and with that basic awareness one can enjoy and learn a lot from THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY. For example, like many people, I suppose, my Beatles listening starts from RUBBER SOUL and their music before that album seems like the most vacuous pop. After watching the documentary, I can appreciate that early music as a heartfelt response to the American rock'n'roll that the four young lads were enchanted by.

This is an entertaining documentary, but not everyone will like everything on it. Originally, the format was much more interview-centered, and you can see this in a ""director's cut"" bootleg that has long circulated. By the time it was broadcast, the documentary had been edited to include much more 1960s footage, with the members of the band often contributing only a line or two between long concert scenes. Therefore, those hoping for lots of facts and trivia may be disappointed, but as someone interested in 1960s fashion and youth culture, I find more footage of that era quite welcome.",1332547200,5,1971,5.099071207430341

I think Paul has come to embrace and relish the music they did; I sometimes got the impression George could have done without much of the experience; and I was touched by Ringo's recollections.  There were few memories Ringo talked about in a negative way.  He said he loved going to the various places, and loved this and that.  He seemed to really appreciate the closeness and friendship the 4 of them had, getting emotional at one point when he said it was 4 guys who just really loved each other.

799765,4,630416923X,"For a Beatle fan (like me) this 10 hour documentary was both thrilling
and just a little disappointing.

Thrilling because all the music has been re-mixed, re-mastered and
sounds great, because there are lots of details that, even as I fan, I
didn't know, because there's more insight than offered elsewhere into
their breakup, and more important, into what held them together.

A good job is done of combining new interviews with the then 3 living
Beatles, and recorded interviews with John from many sources, so his
views and insights aren't missing.

The last couple of hours go deeper than I suspected, and were quite
moving.

On the disappointment side there are a few issues. First, at least for
me, much of the first half got repetitive. Not much new insight into
the birth or meaning of Beatlemania, just lots (and lots and lots) of
concert and TV footage, often of them playing the same songs, sometimes
obviously just lip-syncing to records.

Also, their personal lives are left out entirely. I understand not
focusing on relationships, etc, but there's virtually no mention of
wives, divorces, affairs, children, or how any of that intersected with
their music and work.

Last, I was sorry it didn't go deeper into the creation of the music
itself. While there are lot of great tidbits from the group and George
Martin about specific songs, considering there was 10 hours of program,
I didn't get enough of how they worked, how they wrote, how they
influenced each other. Nor do we get much of their personal views of
the world, politics, etc. And somehow the sense of how much their brief
7 years meant to music and to world culture seems missing, or at least
not really explored.

Yet, whatever was missing, I tore through the 10 hours in 2 nights, and
would have happily seen more.",1323475200,2,1795,4.752411575562701

Everything you would ever want to know about them is explained in detail within the 10 hour documentary.  The Beatles packed so much into such a short period of time that it's never boring, even with the long running time.  It's well worth throwing down the $65.  If you're a Beatles fan, you won't be disappointed.  If you're not a big fan, it will turn you into one.

I see people actually complaining because there's not enough music on this DVD set.  Are you joking?  Of the ten hours of material, probably close to half of it is music.  Besides, this is the only documentary out there where The Beatles get to tell their story in their own words.  Some people out there are missing the point.  If you want to hear the story of the greatest band in popular music history, watch this.  If you want to hear the music, listen to the CDs.  Geesh....",1314576000,3,932,4.411764705882353
799769,5,630416923X,"Great opening montage - the four men are dwarfed by the name ""THE BEATLES"" coming down like something from Tron. Four minutes into the story, which opens with ""In My Life"" and a montage of photos, we get the first words of the story. Birth words, then zeitgeist with the four guys talking about their influences, and how they would listen to whatever was on the radio at the time because nobody had any money and they had to take what they could get. The music that was on hand was ""Rocket 88', Elvis' ""That's alright Mama"", ""Ain't That A Shame. Ringo is hardly quoted here, and the songs aren't adequately subtitled. Paul notes that when he heard Elvis, he thought ""that's the guru we've been waiting for - the messiah has arrived."" References to Big Bill Brunsey, I have to look him up, and the song he sang, ""These Earthly Things."" In those early Liverpool days, Paul and George took a bus to learn their third chord, the B7 (after the A and the E). Paul describes his first meeting with John, how they met at a Quarrymen gig, but how John was impressed that Paul could remember the lyrics, in particular ""25 Rock"" by Eddie Cochrane. Paul gives a demo of this song in the documentary, and he could still sing the lyrics. The band's first recording is ""In Spite Of All The Danger"", a nice little thing. Descriptions of The Jacaranda, which still looks like a club the year they did the documentary. Funny how the band would show up with three guitarists, and the guy would say ""okay, so where's the drummer then."" Lots of scamming going on. There's a 1960s live recording with Stuart Sutcliffe (only one? they played together for sooooo many shows). In Liverpool in 1960, Pete Best was known as ""mean, moody and magnificent."", and he replaced Paul as a drummer - they auditioned him one day, then jumped on a bus for Hamburg to do their first gigs. Rory Storm came to Hamburg with Ringo, and they had first class treatment by sleeping five to a room, much better than what the Beatles had. Paul and Pete were busted for burning a condom against a wall and deported to Liverpool, then they were back in Hamburg for their second stint. Later, there was dissatisfaction with Pete Best, and Ringo sat in for their sessions in Hamburg from time to time. He was mature, bearded, and owned a Zephyr Zodiac. ""That was probably a knock-off, or fell off the back of... a showroom"" Paul explains (ha ha). As the band was coming together, they left Hamburg and lost Stuart Sutcliffe as a bassist; neither John nor George wanted to play bass, so Paul obliged. There was an audition for Decca on January 1st, 1962, which Paul says ""it's not great, but it's good."" Decca boss Dick Rowe didn't sign them claiming that ""guitar groups are on their way out."" They hawked the Decca tape to Parlaphone and EMI and did ""Love Me Do"" and ""Please Please Me"", and this is where Part 1 ends. Hooray.

Part 2 is very much about music. I am now noticing that this documentary doesn't have a narrator and is assembled completely out of interviews with participants in the Beatles story, archival footage, and montages while music that has no accompanying video is played. This one opens with the post-Hamburg era when they are in Liverpool and trying a tour of the UK, playing in London, achieving fame in Liverpool but with no LP released. While snippets from their early sessions is played, the camera roves all over rare photos and posters of the Beatles from the era. The effect is spooky, but also a bit cold. Even colder is later on, when the camera roves around a drumkit, two guitars and a bass player setup, all humans are absent as we listen to John, Paul, George and Ringo record their first album and engage in session banter. Sure, the vintage equipment is interesting to gawk at, but it imparts a sense of loneliness. The boys tell of a tour they did with English artists, as well as people like Roy Orbison. They would hear Roy writing another great song at the back of the tour bus (a little something called ""Pretty Woman""), and felt that they had to try their hardest to keep up. The birth of the competitive songwriting spirit. With time, the boys became swinging Londoners, with Ringo and George renting a room for 45 quid a week (a fortune in those days). The money was coming in and the boys were eating well for the first time in many year (or ever). They were close to the Rolling Stones, gave them ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" before they even recorded it themselves.  There is some live material that looks great but suffers from bad sound for ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" (Paul's lead vocals are drowned out by John's backing vocals, George's guitar can't be heard. In the pre-Command Performance we see some jerk poking the back of Paul's head while he's talking to the camera. There's a shot of the Queen Mother, who seems to be waving to the band. Funny memories of their tour to France, when it was the boys who were screaming for the Beatles and not the girls. Then there's the moment when they get the word that they finally had a hit in the US and it had gone to number 1. That must have been their biggest moment up until then. Part 2 ends with the boys landing up on US shores and experiencing Beatlemania overseas.

Part 3 picks up with EMI letting Capital have the Beatles in the US if they promise to spend $70,000 to promote them. The boys aspired to be in a movie like ""The Girl Can't Help It"", a Jayne Mansfield film that had performances from Little Richard, Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran. Describes the trip to Hong Kong, where there were lots of Brits and no Hong Kongers. Got to Sydney with capes that they had bought in Hong Kong, it rained and the blue colour in the capes ran. Kids who had waited 24 hours were disappointed, but later all of Australia turned out to see them, a sea of people. The UK's Marx Brothers in ""Hard Day's Night"", the boys gong crazy. Girls passing out in the crowd. USA tour collage. They met Little Richard (in Hamburg the first time, but again in the US), Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Fats Domino with his diamond star watch. Bob Dylan. Paul found the meaning of life the night he met Bob Dylan. ""There are seven levels. I laughed and I laughed and I laughed. It was fabulous."" Ringo almost killed in Montreal by anti-Semites?!?  People would wheel out cripples, hoping to have them healed by the Beatles. Opportunism. Only peace was in the loo. John's spastic act explained, pretty crappy. They played 32 shows in 34 days in 24 cities. George Martin - John was the first example of feedback on record, and it was an accident. Paul sometimes at left of stage, sometimes at right. Ringo drum cigarettes. Help! movie, Bahamas, skis, great studio videos. Paul at the tugboat talking about all this. MJ for breakfast. Ringo's crazy phrases came up as ""Hard Day's Night,"" ""Tomorrow Never Knows."" Describing the writing of ""Yesterday"":

  Paul: I had a piano by my bed/ And woke one morning with this tune in my head.
  George: And so, for Paul McCartney of Liverpool England, opportunity knocks.
  John: Thank you, Ringo, that was wonderful.

George noted that ""Sinatra still refers to `Something' as his favourite Lennon-McCartney song. Thank, Frank."" Then, scandal coverage: The MBE Debased!!

Anthology 5 starts up at Shea Stadium, which was packed with 56,000 people. ""At least we're not taking it seriously."" John cracked up, played the ""I'm Down"" organ. John, George and Ringo talk about meeting Elvis. ""They used us as an excuse to go mad, then they blamed us."" Paul interviewed about it in front of one of his stages.

In Part 6, they talk about the mess of playing in the Philippines and how they feared for their lives, they are still very resentful. It was shown on TV how they had not arrived at the presidential palace. Years later, they were finally seen as hip for standing up to Ferdinand and Imelda. Paul sings solo acoustic ""Elenor Rigby."" When the ""bigger than Jesus controversy came out,"" they get a guy from the KKK talking on TV about the Beatles concert in town, making veiled threats. Desperate CBS reporter went around New York tying to find anyone who disliked the Beatles as a result of the whole kerfuffle, finally found a 10-year-old kid who was the only one who admitted that he liked another group better than the Beatles (Herman and his Hermits). They were feeling danger on tour, getting death threats, etc. Too much Elenor Rigby in soundtrack. Music: ""It has been a hobby. It still is."" Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band started out as a concept album, but they only got one or two songs on the concept, then they went back to making a regular album. ""It was 20 years ago today,"" I remember seeing a documentary on 1987 when it was 20 years after the release, now it's nearly 45 years since the release... Jagger at the ""Day in the Life"" sessions with Marianne Faithfull, the orchestra with the funny glasses and fake noses footage. Animated bits from the cover are interesting, then the colouring. Jimi Hendrix opened a London concert with the title track two days after it was released. Ringo learned how to play chess during the recording because there was so much studio tomfoolery. (My son Zen told me that George Harrison looks like Severus Snape, or Doctor Octopus). Julian Lennon in Greece with John, they all do a Greek circle dance on an exclusive island. Nice.

Anthology 7, we get a full glimpse of George's hairy monobrow. ""You can't go to Harrod's to get a mantra."" Defending Magical Mystery Tour, which Paul stepped in to direct, but it was awful. The Beatles used a lot of video after they stopped touring, because they wanted to get messages out to their fans without putting their lives at risk by going on the road. ""Hello Goodbye"", John does an Elvis point `n' pose. Beatles waring 1962 uniforms in 1967. Three Beatles in the park, George on ukelele. George played some of the many songs he wrote at the time in India that he's never recorded, such as ""Derry Doo.""

Anthology 8 starts with The White Album, which they recorded with three studios going at the same time. ""The moment you need is on your shoulder."" Paul at the camp fire talking about the Beatles. George's floppy hat and sheep boots walking around London. Everyone happy to have Billy Preston around because the pressure came off. Ringo shown in great lime green suit with frilly lime collar. People on the street nearby hearing the band come out to figure out what is happening, the band plays a rooftop concert, the police come out and try to bust them, politely, as the cameras roll. John's nonsense singing for some of the verses. Long footage of rooftop concert. John sits on the floor in some sessions. ""An intimate bioscopic experience with the Beatles."" ""Something"" video with the four Beatles wives.",1314316800,2,10774,4.5803941908713695

There has never been and probably never be another group of musicians with as much gravity, talent and generosity  as the Beatles and we are better people for having known them, intimately through their music and the collective story of their individual lives.

This 5 disc set pays homage to their lives and by virtue of our relationship with them, to ours...to our joys and sorrows, our passions and to our humanity.

Enough has been written within Amazon about what was presented within the set yet  I found one part that may have been overlooked on the 5th Disc and that is Ringo, his camera and his final words.  You can see that Ringo was truly a fan of the band and that he had his little throwaway Kodak with him to document the hook-up with his old pals George and Paul...at the very end, he is genuinely moved and expresses how much he enjoyed hanging with his old friends and that was a fitting and lovely way to end the series having spoken for everyone who had the privilege of knowing and growing up with them.

799860,5,630416923X,"There have been many books and documentaries made about the Beatles by other people. This is the only large-scale review of their career by the Beatles themselves. That doesn't mean everything in it is accurate; in fact, early on it is apparent when McCartney says he is 18 months older than George and George says the difference is 9 months (George is right) that memory can play tricks. However, details aside, the magic of this production is that the three remaining Beatles talk about their own impressions of the life and times of the group. John is only represented by clips, but his contribution is invaluable in completing the picture.

Apart from their story told in their own voices, there are numerous performances included, both live and lip-synched, which give a good understanding of how the band developed over the years. Naturally, there is far more of this material from the years 1962-1966, when they were touring, than from 1967-970. That leads to my only serious complaint about the set; surely, given the paucity of later material, the 1969 'rooftop concert' should have been shown in full? Especially since it seems unlikely that the movie 'Let It Be' will be rereleased any time soon.

But, there are a few major oversights.  One such detail is the absence of commentary by Pete Best, the original drummer.  He has never told his side of why he was replaced by Ringo Starr (we only hear the views of John, Paul, and George on that subject), or his experiences as being a member of the Beatles.  Also, the anthology never mentions the Casbah, which Pete's mother owned and was an early gig for the Beatles.  Another missing detail is that Astrid Kirchherr, the woman whom fifth Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe left the group for, doesn't give any commentary, not even a voice-over.  She is only mentioned in passing.  Both of these people were important figures in the band's history, but the anthology does not give them their due credit.  The anthology also ommitted two of the major controversies that concerned the Beatles.  The first controversy is the original Yesterday and Today album cover where the Beatles are seen as sadistic butchers who are smiling in a sinister fashion while they dismember dolls.  This album cover obviously terrified EMI and Capitol executives, who ordered that it be replaced who one that was more wholeseome.  The second controversy is, of course, the false rumor that Paul was dead.  Yet, no one seemed to think that either one was important enough to include in the anthology. In summary, the anthology should have given us the whole picture, warts and all.  It would have been more honest that way.",1305590400,6,1595,4.752727272727273
799865,5,630416923X,"I maintain that The Beatles are the greatest musical influence since Bach.  You thought I was gonna say Mozart didn't ya?  I am a bass player, so Bach is more to my liking.  The reason I am a bass player is because of Paul McCartney.  I grew up in West Texas and before the Beatles, I was all Merle Haggard, the Everleys, and a little Miles Davis.  Hearing ""Love Me Do"" when I was 13 years-old changed my life.  I ended up playing bass guitar for a living, for not much money, for 12 years.  But, I digress.  For me, what makes this Anthology wonderful is watching The Beatles go through the changes they experienced.  It is so cool to see them progress as musicians.  One of the things that stood out for me was that through all of the changes they underwent personally, their music was their lives.  I think this documentary of the phenomenon is a must have for all Beatles fans.  These guys were the soundtrack of my life.  I still hurt when I remember watching Monday Night Football  on December 8, 1980 and hearing Howard Cosell announce that John Lennon had been murdered.  When I was married, my wife and I danced to McCartney's ""My Love.""  I can't hear a Beatles song without it taking me back to some point in my life; some good, some bad, but all still alive in my heart and memory.

799960,5,630416923X,"Different people have different favorite Beatle 'periods'. Many early Beatlemaniacs in the U.S. (Feb 9, 1964+) fell out when the band went Rubber Soul/Revolver. Too weird for them. That was probably true in other parts of the world as well. Some couldn't take ""I am the Walrus"" and ""Strawberry Fields"". Some didn't (re)discover The Beatles until Sgt Pepper. Others didn't accept them as rockers til the White album. So many mourned and cursed their demise as a band in 1970. Many fans weren't born until after they broke up. Many fans are yet to be born. A whole country (England) and many parts of Europe made them superstars before North America had any inkling they even existed. A relative handful (Liverpool) raved on them before all the hoopla started anywhere else. Other early, pre-fame fans (Hamburg, Germany) banged on the stage in appreciation when The Beatles were leather-clad hard rockers, pounding out 50's rock n' roll, high on beer and speed. Later, many innocents who had known them as cute pop-stars were shocked to discover The Beatles had this 'rough and rude' history. Some people never realized (or will realize) how profoundly The Beatles and their studio hands changed the record and recording industries, in so many different ways. They were the ultimate music industry revolutionaries, playing a large role also in changing the culture of large parts of the planet, their impact still reverberating to this day.

This DVD covers all that and more, in very much detail. And for that reason it serves well as a true historical document (albeit filtered somewhat through the Beatles self-serving filters). John was oftentimes cruel and would rag on Beatles manager Brian Epstein, but as quickly turn around and write him...""you know I love you"". Paul was very ambitious and could be pushy and smarmy, but he was the best musician and most creative Beatle. George was sarcastic, paranoid and preachy, but introduced the band, and the West to Indian music and culture. Ringo did not like to be challenged as a drummer, but was the glue that held the band together. Together, their efforts threw hot sparks of powerful, creative energy into the minds of countless people of varied backgrounds all over the world.

In Anthology you don't get the entire '64 Washinton DC, or '65 Shea, or '66 Budokan concerts, or all of all the other shows, or every last unseen video, but you get well more than enough to satisfy: many, many excellent quality films/videos, and you see much, much newsreel footage, some of it rare, all in one place. Heck, I even noticed a couple scenes of their '66 visit to my hometown stadium.  And of course you get the band members themselves in interviews from past and current times(minus John, of course for the current interviews).

If you're looking for 'just the tunes' look elsewhere. But if you want the tunes and the story behind the phenomenon of the Beatles, from the Beatles themselves, this is it.

Unless you have read some of the better, noteworthy Beatles biographies, these DVDs will fill you in on the Beatles' story. Especially noteworthy, to me anyway, are the scenes in 94/95 when ""The Threetles"" hang out and we see how they personally relate to each other. It seems possible towards the end that George may be experiencing health issues and there is genuine emotion glimpsed. And Ringo opens his heart before the cameras and Paul and George and just plain states that he loves them and loves being with them. (He gets a little noogie and inside-joke from Paul). The recording of ""Free As a Bird"" is in so many ways sad, in tone, in execution and simply because John is not really there. Maybe in spirit he is. His loss is reflected in the ghostly quality of the recording and just leaves you to wonder...what if?",1289433600,6,3776,4.829984544049459

800069,5,630416923X,"The Beatles Anthology is a true and noteworthy piece of history. I can't believe that I've gone so long without seeing or owning it, but after receiving my DVD box set, I literally spent an entire weekend watching the entire thing. Probably I thought beforehand, as many would, that over the years we have seen and heard all there is to see and hear about The Beatles. Not even close! I was amazed at the footage and audio that was presented in this collection, which includes more than a few gems.

Paul, George, and Ringo were all closely involved in the production of the anthology, as was George Martin (long time Beatles record producer). The anthology is presented as a historical journey, in chronological order. It begins pre-Beatles and shows each member as a child, discusses their family origins and early interests, etc. We get to 'see' Paul and John meet... watch as George (boyhood friend of Paul's) is introduced to John and joins them... and learn how they later met Ringo and how he took over the drums. There is some amazing audio and video presented for this time period, in addition to many still photos. Recordings of John and Paul pre-Beatles, early Beatles footage performing at The Cavern, etc.

Throughout, we are led through the anthology by Paul, George, Ringo, and Mr. Martin, among others. George Martin plays a key role helping to guide us through this ""Magical History Tour"" and provides a wonderful perspective to recollections of the past. Others have mentioned details about the elements of the archive and the re-uniting of the (then) remaining three. What I found interesting was that various egos would ebb and flow as it went along, each Beatle often remembering events slightly different (but not contradictory) from the others. John is brought to us throughout via the many interviews, quotes, and films. As much as is possible for a project like this, personal agendas were set aside in order to tell a story that no one else is qualified to tell. I think that many years from now historians will be very pleased that this ""in their own words"" history of The Beatles was created.

For even a casual Beatles fan, this is a tremendous anthology, and I recommend it very highly. Of course, now that I have purchased the DVD set, it will surely be released on Blu-ray! I only hope that when that happens even more material is included!",1264982400,8,2372,4.766423357664234

800073,5,630416923X,"At over eight hours, this documentary is likely be tiresome to all but the most hardcore fans but, if you count yourself among the latter group, a splendid time is guaranteed by all. After part one, which covers the lads from Liverpool from birth up to 1962, each successive episode covers approximately a year in the lives and careers of the Fab Four. There's plenty of time for extensive performance footage, including all their Ed Sullivan show appearances, the Royal Variety Performance, much of the Shea Stadium appearance, and even the rather crappy Budokan shows. It's all here, interspersed with extensive interview footage with all the principals. What I learned is: after manager Brian Epstein died in 1967, the Beatles sort of lost their way, lost their reliable arbiter of good judgment and taste, and fell into such misbegotten projects as their Apple boutique and the Get Back/Let It Be film project. I also realised that I don't have a favourite Beatle. George comes off as sort of an old crank, Paul and John as massive egos, and, well, Ringo is just Ringo, a pleasant sort with a nice touch on the drums and an unshakable backbeat. In their characters, there simply wasn't anything all that special about these guys, but they each had a sort of imperfect musical talent. When they combined those talents, however, some kind of magical mystery took place, and they created art for the ages. So, my favourite Beatle is The Beatles, all four of them working together. Which makes me realise that the one thing missing from this extensive documentary is any mention of their solo careers. There's no Plastic Ono Band, no All Things Must Pass, no McCartney (the album) even mentioned here, which seems odd in a way, considering how exhaustive this documentary project purports to be. Yoko Ono's notorious role in driving a wedge between the members of the band is also sloughed over rather quickly at the end of episode seven. Her participation was perhaps necessary to getting access to all the interviews that John gave after the Beatles broke up, and to the successful production of this film. So, the filmmakers are nice to her. But, just her presence, sitting there like a fifth wheel in the studio during the recordings of The White Album and Let It Be speaks for itself. She's darned annoying. If Epstein had lived, he'd probably have said to John that you can't take your wife to the office.",1260662400,2,2411,4.812048192771084

It has to be The Beatles Anthology. Most Mr. Collins fans are also Beatles fans and the two go together perfectly. The Anthology combines a ton of music(mostly footage from live shows or studio outtakes that were only heard on the famous Gray Tape)and first person accounts of the band's storied history. One thing that stood out to Sid during the viewing was the perfect pace of the documentary. The show follows a steady routine of a few minutes of interview of one or more of the principals then a song from the time that had just been discussed. It is perfect for the short attention span that accompanies Mr. Collins.

Of course, the film was released in 1995, so the current interviews were from Paul, George, Ringo, George Martin, Neil Apinsall, and a few others. However, the old Lennon interview clips they used were excellent as well as always pertinent. Everyone interviewed was always talking about something with which they had direct knowledge, so it is without conjecture like so many other documentaries. It actually gives you what feels like an insight to the amazing journey that was The Beatles.

If you are a Beatles fan, or even remotely interested then you should at least give the Anthology a try. If you like The Beatled and Mr. Collins and haven't seen this, wassa matta? It is ridiculously entertaining and interesting. And you get to listen to Beatles tunes. So, on the recomendation of Sid the Elf, put on your gold boots, jump out of the stocking and chase the Anthology and Mr. Collins around the room.

This film actually stems from a 1971 film Neil from Apple corp made called ""The Long and Winding Road"" and was placed on fold and was actually be end with a filmed re-union of the 4 Bealtes doing a few songs, but Lennon died and the film was on hold until 1994 when they decided to complete it.

The only gripes...2 gripes out of 8 hours.....on some of the songs, one example is Revolution 9, the song jams to a pristine video clip....then they fade the song down and have John talk about how it came into being then the music comes back up. I'd rather have the song play out then have Johns audio talk about the song.
Gripe #2 is the bonus features, there are 2 segments were the surviving 3 (Threatles) are playing songs, one is sitting on the ground by a stream and George has a ukilalie, they play 1 song, another section is the 3 are actually back in the studio doing an acoustic jam...I wish they just showed all that footage..or edit it down to shwoing all the songs and some chit-chat...I mean what a historic happening, the 3 surviving Beatles back and actually performing songs! It mighta been a but lack-luster, but just the historical context of that alone merits it worthiness........or maybe Apple will package it as a DVD someday.....make some bucks that way.

The Anthology series flows and is never dull, you can watch the whole series then a week later go through it all again and have it seem just as fresh. It's a true work of art from hours and hours of hard work collection various news reels, interviews, tv clips, promos and hours of new interviews edited down to be inserted in the film.

The Beatles were the background music of the mid-late '60s, and as such, were the major rock music contributors of the time.

The most surprising thing was the fact that Paul and Yoko were able to come to an agreement that allowed the surviving Beatles to record ""with"" John on two songs he'd done. Also, although George was obviously less eager for the reunion, he ""took one for the team,"" and possibly for his ""big brother,"" John.

My own reactions also surprised me: I enjoyed the first half and a bit more of the episodes; the 2nd half became increasingly disappointing as everything, including their friendships, came apart.

800362,5,630416923X,"More than 30 years after their demise as a band, the Beatles keep setting records. (though it was 25 years when the Anthology was released)

When the Anthology was first aired, right after, in one day 450,000 albums of Anthology 1 were sold, the most albums EVER sold in one day. (and it wasn't cheap, either) There was the audio version of the Anthology first, and each one cost...was it $30? Something like that, but they had a LOT of songs on each disc. Then the video Anthology finally came out on VHS. Then the Anthology coffee table book. Finally, the DVD version you will buy. Amazing, when you think of it. As you get into this you will see that the Beatles did this with as much class and integrity as they did everything else they ever did. A good example is the Free As A Bird video. One of the coolest videos ever, it has lots of hidden references to their songs and story. (There is also a lot of humor from the Beatles as it all unfolds)

The song ""Free As A Bird"" won a Grammy in 1997, and the video also won a Grammy. The Beatles thus break further ground being a band with a long deceased member who still charts in the top 10... 25 years after disbanding, and winning top awards.

 ""Real Love,"" the single, reached #4 and #11 in the UK and US singles charts respectively and earned a gold record faster than a number of the group's other singles.

These examples illustrate in just a small way the colossal impact this 4 piece group had on music and modern culture. As Mick Jagger admitted, ""People today can't realize just how huge and untouchable the Beatles were in the 60s.""(sic) He called them a ""four headed giant.""

A great visual of how overwhelming their fame became is at the beginning of each episode when you see them playing real clear and well, and then they are drowned out by human screams that sound like a thousand jet engines, and then the camera fades back and the gigantic Beatles ""drop-t"" logo dwarfs them until they are no longer even visible within the monster they created. This is a large part of the point of their story. They considered themselves just a great little rock band that was admittedly greater than the sum of it's parts. This is that story, told by themselves.

My Dad told me that The Beatles took so much money out of the USA, that it scared the United States Government. They were very wealthy within a year or two of conquering America, and that's without the money they SHOULD have gotten from their publishing, and England had something like a 98% tax!!! That they were so rich they could lock down the world's greatest recording studio at will for indeterminate time, when studio time was HUGELY EXPENSIVE, shows what they were worth.

Other bands all over the world stood in despair every time the Beatles released a new record because each one was a dramatic and devastating departure from what they (or anyone) had done before. No one could even think of keeping up, though they tried, and that includes the Rolling Stones, who, while great, were in a very deep shadow. This became especially true by the time of Rubber Soul and onward.

The thing that the videos show and it shows in an even more astonishing way if you dig into the literature, is how hard and non-stop these young guys worked. They did all the right things, led every step of the way, and seemingly effortlessly changed everything. If you consider that they released 2 albums and 3 singles per year, on top of endless television appearances, tours and recording sessions, they rarely had a day off for years. On the outside, we don't realize that often times they would finish work on a classic album, and if not the next day, within days they were working on the NEXT classic album. And during all this incredible activity, they found time to write tons of timeless classics and create innovative recording techniques that forever changed the way records were recorded, down to this day, and with the help of their ingenius Abbey Road staff, came up with new sounds and gadgets such as flanging, artificial double tracking, using Leslie speakers for vocals, locking up several 4 track recorders in sync, etc. The list goes on. And the modern music lover should be made to understand that back in those days, you couldn't just turn on a keyboard and get endless weird sounds like you can now, if they wanted something different (and they did, for every song) they had to somehow create something new from what they had.

There is a lot more that the Anthology covers, but other reviews have gone into that in depth. My aim is to show why there even IS an anthology of 10 DVDs on a rock group. Does anyone else have a legacy or a story to match this? Nope.

Buy the Anthology, also buy the book, it's got a whole different bunch of stuff and photos that the Anthology doesn't have time to cover, it's a great set overall. Also, a major point is that you get to hear alternate versions of almost every song that is included, songs that are drilled into the brains of everyone all over the world, and it's interesting to hear the evolution of these masterpieces.

If you are a big fan (big- not ""moderate"" or ""casual"") you'll eat this up. Besides the early never before heard recordings, photos, performances, and interviews, the stories told by the Beatles and their close associates are just fascinating. And what's great (and pretty funny also) is that they don't always have the same opinions or recollections on events surrounding the band. For example, it seems apparent that George Harrison disliked Beatlemania but Ringo sounds like he really enjoyed it. Also, it's great to learn that despite the eventual acrimony they were very close to one another, something else that makes this worth watching. The last few chapters kind of bum me out because of the dissension and eventual breakup, but you'll get an insight as to why it happened and I think come to realize it was their only option. The added disc has special features about the making of the documentary and accompanying videos that will also be devoured by ""big"" fans. If you're near my age, 50, it will bring back great memories of a great time and answer all the questions you ever had about the Beatles, The most enjoyment a Beatle fan can have for $49.95.

800508,4,630416923X,"Since purchasing this set, I have watched it through twice and some parts three or more times.  It is both entertaining and gives a good overview of Beatles music.  The real strength of this set is the range of music it includes and the very fine video from televised performances, newsconferences, reporting, documentaries, etc.  The film clips are very good.  I also liked the special features extremely well, particularly the feeling of the remaining Beatles (three at that time) about arranging and recording John's ""Free As A Bird"" and ""Real Love"" tapes.

The film gives only a very general chronology.  It also addresses some controversies in passing, but the main focus is on the music and the sensation that resulted from it as well as recording the individual personalities of The Beatles.  Ringo probably talks more and is more open in the interviews on this series than I have ever seen him.

I found that the series fed my desire to explore specific topics of Beatles history including the Hamburg experience, Stu Sutcliffe, Pete Best, Brian Epstein, George Martin and Goeff Emerick at EMI studios; Cynthia Lennon and Yoko Ono.  So, it's not the whole story, but the central portion of it--the boys themselves and as musicians.

I suppose that adds to the aura of the Anthology as much as the actual content. Looking at the footage of concerts and photo shoots, listening and seeing the ""lads"" tell their stories is a treat as well as a time capsule experience for those of us who have memories of our own that go back to those years.
For the younger generations, this series affords the opportunity to see what that era looked like and get a better feel for what was...for better or for worse...a decade of unprecedented change in the world and the individual lives of those who were there.

800753,5,630416923X,"As a fan of Beatles music for some 20 years now, I naturally found this collection pretty enjoyable, as my appetite for ""behind-the-scenes"" footage always exceeded what was commercially available. While it is true that much of what is on this 5-disc DVD series has been seen before (the often-seen Ed Sullivan show appearances, for example, and the first US tour landing at JFK airport), it does, however, include some footage that I hadn't seen before, such as some extended scenes at the Maharishi complex in India, for example, and a few live performances from the Rubber Soul/Revolver period filmed in color. Perhaps more importantly, there are some pretty good interviews with the surviving members, that were done specifically for the release of this series back in 1995.

The interviews at George Harrison's estate in 1994 include conversations with Paul, George, and Ringo reminiscing about some of the band's early experiences, and include a brief jam session by the three of them, complete with amplifiers and instruments inside George's home; as well as a lovely outdoor scene on the lawn, where they sit casually on the grass and converse, and even sing a song or two with ukelele's while Ringo pats out a beat on his knees.

The 1995 get-together with George Martin at the sound mixer in the Abbey Road studios is also quite memorable, and includes discussions with the four of them (Paul, George, Ringo, and George Martin) about how some of the songs came together in the studio, including A Day in the Life and Tomorrow Never Knows, to name a couple.

Since it is not my intent to provide much further in the way of content review, I will add only one minor technical point, which might or might not be helpful to other purchasers of this product. Each of the 1st four discs contains two episodes (the 5th disc is bonus material...the making of, etc.). I mistakenly assumed that both episodes of each disc would play all the way through automatically. However, I realized much to my chagrin after watching 2 of the 5 discs that I had missed the second episode of each disc. This was because (in the case of my particular DVD player model, at least) it was necessary to return to the top menu after the first episode, in order to access the second episode of each disc. Needless to say, my failure to discover this sooner resulted in a rather out-of-sequence viewing experience for me. I don't really fault the producers of the discs for this, so much as myself for not having realized it sooner.",1194912000,5,2510,4.752293577981652

Through their own voices and loads of archival footage(interviews and concerts), John, Paul, Ringo and George take you on a journey from their humble beginnings in Liverpool to their final break up concert on top of Apple Records.

I've got hours of enjoyment watching these dvds, and it's amazing to see the Beatles go from small local band to international superstars. Even though they broke up around the time I was born, watching these dvds I did get a sense of what Beatlemania was all about.

The dvd set conveyed that magic spark that ignited the world back in 1960s and now I understand why the Beatles have endured.

This set also inlcudes interviews with producer George Martin and road manager Neil Aspinall, as well as George, Ringo and Paul in 1994 and 1995 --'94 reminiscing about the old days/'95 at Abbey Road studios discussing how they did certain songs.

800760,5,630416923X,"From the Beatles' own mouths, this is the ultimate insider view of a cultural phenomenon that changed the world. The only downside is that, because the series was originally made for TV, the DVDs aren't in widescreen format. You can compensate with the ""zoom"" aspect on your widescreen TV, which usually looks great, but on some of the old footage, heads might be cut off. Viewing in the ""Just"" (justify) aspect ratio gives you the whole image in widescreen, but the Fab Four (and everything else) look a bit squished. Or just watch in undistorted 4:3 aspect, with bars on the side. Any way you view it, The Beatles Anthology is a must for any current or former Beatlemaniac, as well as rock musicians or students of the art who want to know how we got to where we are today. And hearing the lads in 5.1 Dolby Sound is a thrill. The extra disc of special features offers Beatle perspectives filmed years after the original series aired. You can buy a coffee-table companion book to the Beatles Anthology series, which adds lots of color and detail not in the DVDs, and I recommend it to the serious fan, but it's so big and heavy that it isn't easily read in bed, or in any position, for that matter.

Update Aug. 15, 2011: Ignore my comments about aspect ratio issues (I had an old DVD player and widescreen TV back then); my newer Oppo DVD player and Panasonic plasma TV seem to have much better capability to fill the widescreen with a 4:3 image in the ""full"" aspect ratio without causing much, if any noticable distortion.

And it doesn't seem to have a feature where you can just play the music videos. But I guess it's supposed to be a documentary & not a collection of music videos. Also I seem to recall some minor scenes when I saw it on TV in 1995 that weren't on the DVD, like the reunited Beatles in the 90's admiring one of the member's fancy car.",1179273600,12,943,4.075268817204301

It is the story of the Beatles from when they were young boys in Liverpool to when they recorded their last album, and everything in between.  It is not only told through their words and interviews, but by their music, their movies and live performances, including their first concert at Shea Stadium and their appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show, just to name a few.  Anthology also comes with a bonus disc of extras which includes the making of Anthology and the recording of the two latest Beatles singles, ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"".

This is about 10 hours of complete Beatles history. The best pictures,concert footage,sound,etc.than any other Beatles DVD.This set is so superbly put together that it takes your breath away. I can't describe it. Just buy it and you will know what I mean. My favorite parts?Well everything,but the rare TV footage is priceless. The Shea Stadium concert is in gorgeous color and quite a lot of it is included. The EMI studio chat both for the early years and the White album is fantastic! Yeah,two sections where you hear nothing but snippits of conversation from the studio. Loved it. There's the boys' promo films for Paperback Writer and Rain. This is rare stuff and it's all here. Nothing is left out. It spans the years 1940-1970 just to give you an idea of the gargantuan tome you will be enjoying. Plus a bonus DVD which is facinating. Oh how could I forget?!There is a lot of concert footage also;ie,France in 1965 not '64,Blackpool Night Out from June 1965,and other marvelous concert footage. I'm a little annoyed about one reviewer who entitled his review ""McCartney Grudge""and went on to say that Paul somehow fixed it so that John was edited out of the press conferences. Oh yeah,big bad Paul took the time out to do this. He also had time to wash everyone's cars in the parking lot and shampoo their dogs too. But he wouldn't wash Yoko's car. Whatever. Also one person noted George's discomfort being around Paul during the commentary. That's funny,because I saw Paul biting his nails and choosing his words very carefully whenever he was with the other two. It's no wonder since everything is always big bad Paul's fault. Enough already. If Paul McCartney ruffled George's feathers it's only because Paul was in his own little world in the studio. His only concern was making perfect music. The music he heard in his head. And John wasn't exactly sleeping either. If Paul stepped on some toes,oh well. The guy was a pop genious, a modern day Mozart. So was John for that matter. Geniouses always have volitile personalities,and they are usually perfectionists too. And thank God for that! Now we can sit back and enjoy the results of that genious every time we play a Beatles record.

Hearing and seeing them sitting around talking about the past was great.  Watching them adding their own marks to John's recording of FREE AS A BIRD was a reminder of just how well they really were together.  It was as if John had written it for just that purpose.

801018,5,630416923X,"I'm slightly puzzled by the negative reviews of this DVD set, which largely consists of the eight shows from 1995 reworked from the previously released videos. For ""Anthology"" read ""Collage"". The torn paper pictures which make up the box and sleeve graphics give a very good idea of the eclectic approach. It's not always clear who's talking or what the video footage is from. As has been pointed out, this is sort of a set for completists. Sort of. Other than some of the History of Rock shows from VH1, most of the popular culture shows I've seen have been done this way and some of them were very bad indeed. PBS is full of boring documentaries on everything under the sun which they get from a variety of sources, some as reliable as the rumor mill that is the Internet.

That said, this is one of the few series that gets anywhere like behind the scenes.  A friend of mine who is a guitarist can't get enough of it and kept checking it out from the library and watching it over and over until we finally went half and got it (at a great price) from Amazon. Even given the atmospheric, amateur film school style, this set puts Beatlemania into context. You can't understand the music at all without knowing the part George Martin played, who is often interviewed here. The reflections of George Harrison and Ringo also prove invaluable. This series gives one of the few looks at the early Beatles, pre- Ed Sullivan, why they played the Cavern Club, why and when they were in Germany. It's the only footage I've ever seen of Richard Starkey AKA Ringo that shows his popularity before he met the other Fab Three.

About the only angle this series doesn't touch on is that explored by Steve Turner in the recent book, The Gospel According to the Beatles. And there are, of course, bits of the puzzle yet to be put in place. For one thing, where is the Beatles cartoon show on DVD? Where is Let it Be on DVD?

801156,5,630416923X,"Having recently read Bob Spitz's massive but delightful book ""The Beatles: The Biography"", I wanted to check out the Beatles Anthology again, not having watched it in many years.

""The Beatles Anthology"" (5 DVDs; approx. 645 min.) does an absolutely superb job in bringing the visual history of the Beatles to the screen. Here some of my personal highlights of this set: (1) the Swedish TV appearance from late '63, where the band gets asked to do an impromptu additional song, and Paul tears into a rousing ""Have Some Fun Tonight""; (2) the madness that was Beatlemania in mid-1964, such as the visit to Amsterdam and the premiere of ""A Hard Day's Night"" movie in London; (3) the Shea Stadium concert in August 65, with a cleaver pre-concert montage (I also had forgotten this was the first stadium show in rock history); (4) the first intentional video in 1966 for ""Paperback Writer""; (5) the montage for ""A Day in the Life""; (6) the utter boredom of the guys, but in particular George, in the video for ""Hello Goodbye""; and (7) the whole commotion around the opening of the Apple store in December, 1967 (capping off an unbelievable 6 months, started with the ""Pepper"" album release).

The ""Special Features"" DVD is actually quite good. The best bits are of course George, Paul and Ringo reminiscing and playing/strumming some songs (such as a great ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"") in various sessions in 94 and 95 (George's story of his second--and last--meeting with Elvis in the early seventies is hilarious). The guys also spend time in the studio with producer George Martin going through various takes of some songs; the disection of ""I'm Only Sleeping"" and ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" will be fascinating for true Beatles fans.

In all, this is a massive DVD set, but enjoyable from beginning to end, and that's an understatement. As the years go by, this now also becomes a nice time piece for historians looking back at the 1960s culture and society. Essential and highly recommended!",1155340800,,1983,4.8609467455621305

If there's a theme to this series, it's that the Beatles really were more than the sum of their parts. Paul, George, Ringo, even John (on film) each at some point refers to The Beatles as something separate from themselves, as if they too were looking at the group from the outside.

What struck me most about the series, when I saw it on TV when it first aired, and just recently on this excellent DVD set, was the creativity of The Beatles. When the band started, in the pre-Ringo days and shortly after he joined the group, they did other people's songs, giving them their own spin. After they started recording, they also did a few of their own numbers, and soon they were doing almost exclusively numbers they'd composed themselves.

It was also fascinating to see how George and Ringo reacted to the prolific creativity of John and Paul. George and Ringo were master musicians, but had shown little inclination to write music. George began tentatively and eventually wrote songs (Something, Taxman, While My Guitar Gently Weeps) that rivalled the Lennon/McCartney hits. Ringo didn't write much at all until after The Beatles, and his only songs that are memorable are the ones he co-wrote with George (Photograph, It Don't Come Easy).

When the band finally split up, the individual members kept on making music, but little of their work compared to the work they'd done together. Why? Was it the combination of their talents? Was it their youth and energy? Was it producer George Martin?

With roughly ten hours of episodes and extras on five DVDs, you'll have plenty of material to ponder and come to your own conclusion.",1150934400,25,1870,4.723926380368098

Quibbles aside, there's a wealth of vintage clips that put all those bootleg videos and DVD's to shame. Worth it for THIS alone.

The McCartney Grudge: To the reviewer below who believed that McCartney ordered the press conference and interview clips edited in such a way as to take the focus off John...well...you're wrong. 60's era press conferences were fairly tedious (most of the questions about how much money the band is making) and rock journalism didn't come into vogue until the late 60's. I have hundreds of unedited 63-66 era interviews with the Beatles and Paul is almost ALWAYS the focus because John really didn't have any interest in press conferences.

Everyone knows that in the early days, John Lennon led the group.  And all the footage of their performances, while they were still touring, was when the group was still in it's early days.  Yet, we see the film cut to show the parts where McCartney is speaking for the group and there is very little footage showing John Lennon speaking for the group, as he did much of the time when they were performing live in the touring days.

It's such a shame that a man with so much talent, so much raw musical instinct and sheer performing genius can still be so upset by being usurped by John Lennon.  Get over it Paul, the man is no longer around.",1142899200,4,1039,4.548387096774194

I don't know what the Brits were going through, but here in the states we had just lost a President to an assassins bullet, we were at the begining of the Vietnam war, civil rights was on the dawn. Space shots were in it's infancy, television was black and white, and there was actually discipline in the schools and at home, and if you were good and if you were lucky, you could watch the unfolding of the Beatle era on the Ed Sullivan Show.

801399,5,630416923X,"When ""The Beatles Anthology"" CDs started coming out it seemed like it was basically an attempt to clear out the vaults of anything that might be of passing interest to Beatles fans.  The ""new"" Beatles songs, ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love,"" were okay but nothing special (what could be under the circumstances?) and while hearing the very first Beatles recording (""That'll Be the Day"") is charming, the demo version of ""No Reply,"" the false starts of ""Eight Days a Week,"" and the strings only version of ""Eleanor Rigby"" are of relative value.  George Harrison's early acoustic version of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" is a gem, but my favorite bit was actually the bit with Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise where they do shtick with the boys (Eric keeps talking about ""Bongo"" playing the drums) and sing ""Moonlight Bay.""  But overall we are talking about a whole lot of alternative takes that you can take or leave.

But when you sit down to watch the eight parts of ""The Beatles Anthology"" DVD everything changes because, to coin a phrase, seeing is believing.  Back in November of 1995 the there were three two-hour television specials, which coincided with the releases of the first CD.  But by the time they put out this DVD set ""The Beatles Anthology"" had been expanded to eight episodes running just a bit short of ten hours, which is a significant increase in length.  You also get a bonus disc containing extra material to get you over the 10-hour mark.  The story begins with the birth of the boys in Liverpool and ends with ""The End,"" the final track from the final album.  What we have is a combination of film and audio footage from the past mixed with interviews with the (then) three surviving Beatles (John Lennon's comments come from his press interviews) and three key members of the group's inner circle: producer George Martin, roadie and Apple executive Neil Aspinall, and press representative Derek Taylor.  Restricting the talking heads to this small group creates a more intimate retrospective because we see the Beatles story from the inside with all of the perspectives from the other side being contemporaneous comments.

So, if you are looking for rare footage of the Beatles performing, there is plenty of that here, but it is also interesting to hear what the Beatles themselves have to say in retrospect (which even John gets to do, albeit not from the perspective of today).  However, if you are looking for the definitive answers on such questions as whether or not John wrote ""All You Need Is Love"" for the live broadcast, forget about it, because this documentary is perfectly content to let people disagree.  Paul McCartney is the one who seems to be most aware that he is speaking for posterity, but that is hardly surprising.  This documentary really is for the long time Beatles fan, because these eight episodes do not really serve as an introduction to the history of the group.  If you do not already know who was married to whom, what Beatles songs were topping the charts, or some of the other basics, ""The Beatles Anthology"" will not enlighten you.

Still, it is a fascinating look at the most important music group in history.  John can dismiss them as just being a band that broke up, but few people ever bought into that particular bit of revisionism, much as we appreciated Lennon's efforts to avoid self-aggrandizement.  Ironically what I ended up appreciating the most was how the music from the CDs came alive in the context of the documentary.  Hearing different versions of familiar Beatles songs works here because being slightly different they become new again.  Besides, this time you are not hearing track after track of alternative versions and false starts, but hearing them mixed in with archive footage and contemporary interviews.  ""The Beatles Anthology"" is not the definitive look at the Beatles, but it does become their version of their own story for what that is worth (which is a lot, but to be taken with those proverbial grains of salt).  You would have to be a hard-core Beatles fan to own the DVDS, but as a rule of thumb I would say that if you have all of the Beatles CDs (with or without all of the""Anthology"" CDs), then you should check this out at least once.",1138060800,23,4235,4.748976807639837

After seeing this incredible documentary i have new appreciation for both their music as a group and later as individual artists, and for each of the Beatles as the people they were, became, and are today.  This collection is a real treasure.  I watched all 6 dvds with 3 children aged 14-19 and their father who WAS there to see it all happen and is a musician himself.  Everyone fully engaged; this story is exceedingly amazing, humane, and both historical and timeless.  Depth of character (both strengths and flaws), creative vision and courage, and distinctive personalities of every Beatle is revealed and emphasized, particularly when you get to see how their interviewed recounting is humorously contradictory.  Beautiful footage of John and George, god bless them both.  Thank you boys for giving us so much joy and feeding our souls with your creative gifts.

I kept talking to the television and saying, ""See, fellas, it wasn't that hard afterall.  You don't have to stop with two of John's old songs.  Keep going!!!!"" But alas, it didn't happen, and now all we have is history.  Popular music, for the most part, has been so rotten for the past three decades, perhaps younger bands can use the ""Free as a Bird/Real Love"" sessions  to witness how to create harmony parts, middle bits and guitar rifts that actually fit and compliment the song.

801404,5,630416923X,"During the week of Thanksgiving 1995, the ""The Beatles Anthology,"" a biography of the Fab Four, rolled onto TV screens around the world, propelled by an inescapable wave of hype.

During the series' run, ABC (the network that broadcast the program over three nights) actually and unfortunately began identifying themselves as ""A-Beatles-C.""

And while the ratings for the five-hour ""Anthology"" were huge, the shows themselves were a little disappointing.

The programs covered most of the bases of the Beatles' story, but offered very little for the hardcore fans who, let's face it, were the only viewers likely to stick around for the entire five hours. And even at five hours, the broadcast version of ""The Beatles Anthology"" was cursory, sanitized and surprisingly short on music.

Telling the story of the Beatles is a little like building an ocean liner: If you're not going to make it big, broad and fully-loaded, what's the point?

So it's cool that the ""Anthology"" is a 10-hour nuts-and-bolts epic of Ken Burns proportions. Virtually every aspect of the band's history is covered, there's lots of rare performance footage (and music by artists who influenced the Beatles, as well), and the DVD transfer is crisp and clear. It's a completely different entity from the broadcast version, and succeeds in every area where the previous version failed.",1124755200,7,1356,5.1454545454545455

The Beatles' music holds a special place in my early life, and watching this brings back many great memories, but their albums, of coarse, are just as essential.",1121904000,,529,4.888888888888889
801406,5,630416923X,"Many Beatles fans who own the three double-disc Anthology CD's,and of course the original releases of their albums,own VHS or DVD copies of the official documentary of this rock 'n roll legendary band. Paul McCartney,Ringo Starr and George Harrison tell all their fans about how they made it big in their native Liverpool,the rest of England,America and other countries as well. When they came along,it was Goodbye,Elvis. Too bad John Lennon didn't live to tell stories also. Here is the life histories of all four Beatles. Well,until the band broke up. Many believe that Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and McCartney's first now-deceased wife Linda Eastman broke up the Beatles. George and Ringo were married men themselves at the time of the break-up. This is definitely a revision and update of the 1964 Capitol Records album THE BEATLES STORY. Ringo became the Beatles drummer after Pete Best was fired. Previously,Ringo was the drummer for Rory Storme and the Hurricanes. John,Paul and George performed together under several different names such as John & The Moondogs and Silver Beatles and then The Beatles. John told a story about how he and Paul met in the 1988 Warner Bros. documentary IMAGINE-THE DEFINITIVE PORTRAIT OF JOHN LENNON. The Beatles became teen idols just like their American Capitol Records labelmates The Beach Boys. Their fame and fortunes led to a short film career,making the films A HARD DAY'S NIGHT,HELP! and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. Controversy arose in 1966,when Lennon told an audience that the Beatles were ""more popular than Jesus Christ"". This outraged many fans,inspiring a bonfire in Alabama. Fans placed their Beatles memorabilia into the bonfire and saying things like ""The Beatles are dull and ordinary."". Lennon later apologized for the outrageous comment. Lennon meant no harm in saying that. So the Beatles quit touring and spent all their business time in the studio,experimenting with new sounds. Harrison,joined forces with an Indian man named Ravi Shankar and studied the sitar. He developed an interest in Indian music and culture. Hey,he took an Indian woman to be his second wife. His first wife,Patti Boyd dumped him for his best friend Eric Clapton. Lennon married his college sweetheart Cynthia Powell and had a son,Julian now aged 42 and a rock star himself. In '68,John and Cynthia divorced and John romantically hooked up with Tokyo-born Yoko Ono(John and Yoko first met in '66 when Yoko was married to her second American husband). In '69,John and Yoko married several days after Paul and Linda Eastman tied the knot. Ringo married now-deceased Maureen Cox in '65. They were divorced long before Ringo married actress Barbara Bach in 1981. Ringo is an actor also,appearing in a few films over the years. The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein died of a drug overdose in 1967 and the band were negotiating on who will replace him. Paul McCartney suggested his father-in-law manage the group and the other three Beatles suggested Allen Klein. George Martin continued to produce the band's music through 1970 when the band broke up. Since the break-up all four Beatles have had successful solo careers. Paul formed Wings with Linda and some new people. John,who was murdered in 1980 at age 40 in New York City where he last lived,has formed a short-lived Plastic Ono Band,with Yoko of course. George co-founded the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne,Bob Dylan,Tom Petty and the late Roy Orbison. Ringo formed his All-Starr Band with various musicians joining and leaving. Harrison succumbed to lung cancer in 2001 at age 58. I dedicate this item to the memories of Lennon and Harrison. Lynne,formerly the frontman for the Electric Light Orchestra,produced the two most recent Beatles' songs,FREE AS A BIRD and REAL LOVE. Those songs were both 75% original,with Lennon's previously recorded vocal,circa 1977. Also,many Beatles fans own the literary ""coffee table"" counterpart,authored by all four Beatles.",1115596800,3,3945,5.184952978056426
801407,5,630416923X,"I just watched the Anthology again, and I realize even more the vast extent of Paul's talent. I know, I know John Lennon was great, they all were.  John was always my favorite, and still is for some emotional reason which I still don't understand!  BUT there is no doubt that Paul McCartney just freaking oozes musical talent, he was the most musically talented Beatle.  The guy could sing great, write great music, great lyrics, plays bass better than anyone, plays great piano, also could play lead guitar (listen to him play ""Blackbird"" in the Anthology), excellent drums (""Ballad of John and Yoko""), and who knows what-all else.  All you people who think it's cool to put Paul down, you just don't know what you're talking about.  Plus, he's a great performer who loves to perform and loves his audience, a great family man, a loyal husband, always a positive outlook, PLUS not to mention he was about the best-looking guy in the world!

Every stage of their career is here, and for many, this is the one place to glimpse lots of rare footage and to understand--even better than the accompanying CDs--exactly how the Beatles worked in and out of the studio, and how their songs were made.

But it's also an extremely sad story.  I have been a Beatle fan since the early 1970s, bought all their albums, saw all the films, read as many books as I could get my hands on, and yet never really, fully realised how ugly and brutal their breakup really was, or how sick of the whole Beatlemania thing all four were (only Lennon was the most honest in his Rolling Stone interviews).  One clearly gets a sense of the extreme exhaustion all four members suffered when they gave up touring in 1966, and how sick of the ""longest cocktail party"" they had become by 1969.  Perhaps the Anthology focuses too much on uncovering the horrible, honest truth of The Beatles, but it perhaps also stands as a testimony to their collective genius that they continued to make such great music even to the end.  Watch these DVDs and prepare to see The Beatles as you've never seen them before.

801502,5,630416923X,"It started in Liverpool England.  What was set in motion was a rock band so incredible they changed the history of the world.  This ten hour DVD documentary is the Holy Grail of all Beatles documentaries.  It begins with family histories as Ringo says his mother always told him WWII started because he was born.  John, Paul, George, and Ringo came from the working class and soon found rock'n'roll and each other.

  In their own words we hear the complete story from beginning to end.  From early recordings of 1958 on we can see the band developing from month to month, year to year.  The first good movie of them is at the Cavern right after Ringo joined with ""Some Other Guy"" with John's full-throated vocals, and the crowd asking, ""Where's Pete?""  We get some great rare footage of them on the BBC as well as their tours.  Then they hit the States as the perfect antidote to the JFK assassination.  1964 was the year they took the world by storm as millions come down with Beatlemania.  1965 is the legendary Shea Stadium concert with 57,000 hysterical fans.  By 1966 they're already into LSD and Eastern music and philosophy.  Here we get the first (and greatest) rock videos of ""Paperback Writer"" and ""Rain"".
  Then after they snub the fascist queen of the Philippines they barely escape the island hellhole and decide that's the end of touring.  Then comes the most creative year ever, 1967.  ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane"" debut as trippy acid inspired videos on Ed Sullivan, ""Sergeant Pepper"" is released, Brian Epstein dies, ""All you need is Love"" debues on world satellite, and ""Magical Mystery Tour"".  By 1968 they are drifting apart, but not before creating ""The White Album"", ""Abbey Road"", ""Let It Be"", and ""Hey Jude"".",1108944000,4,1740,4.7558528428093645
801503,5,630416923X,"This is by far the greatest documentary on any band, that I've ever seen, and for ten plus hours it better be.  Most people may think that this is too long, however, when watching this the time just flies by.  Although there is a seemingly endless amount of information, The Beatles Anthology is very enjoyable.  It gives the most detailed look at the greatest band in the history of rock n' roll, from their perspective.  Nobody could tell the story better than the Beatles themselves, and finally the world gets to see them.  For those who saw this when it was on T.V., the DVD's have over 4 more hours of extra footage.  Much of this stuff is great clips of Beatle performances and extension of topics that were already mentioned on the T.V. version.  Some of the new footage is an entirely new topic altogether, which makes the DVD's all that much better.

The Beatles Anthology has everything a fan could ask for.  From Ringo's birth in 1940, to the end in 1970, the remaining Beatles (along with George Martin and others) talk about pretty much everything they could remember from those turbulent years.  And lets not forget the music.  Not only does the band talk about the songs we also get to hear them, isn't that UNBELIEVABLE.  Well not really, but it is cool, and we get to see them perform many of their most famous ones along with countless others.  For me, episode five does the best job of this, and it's also what I believe to be the best episode.  It takes place during the height of Beatlemania, and starts off with the famous She Stadium performance in 1965.  From here, the performances just keep on coming.  Throughout the entire episode there are great performances of classic songs, along with detailed of accounts events and the making of their albums.  My only real big gripe about the whole set actually happens to be in episode five, and it is about Revolver.  Lately this has been considered one of the greatest albums of all time, and all that is really mentioned about it is just two or three of the songs.  Otherwise, everything's good.  The other episode I found to be very good, was the first one.  I didn't expect to really like this one too much, but it is very good.  In the other episodes the Beatles were stars, but in this one, they are just beginning and it is interesting to see the types of things they went through in trying to make it.

The Beatles Anthology is perfect for a big fan of the Beatles.  For the casual fan that would like to know their story, I would probably think about getting the Complete Beatles first, if you can find it.  However, for the person who thinks it is time to really get into this remarkable band, this is definitely needed.  Once you get this, you shouldn't be surprised if you spend all day watching it.  The Beatles are classic in just about everyway; from the way they worked their way to the top, to the music they made, this is their story.",1108684800,4,2923,4.4763705103969755

801506,5,630416923X,"This 8-part documentary, collected on 4 DVDs (plus an additional disc of bonus material), is truly a must-have for serious Beatles fans. If you are unfamiliar with the history of the band and its development, you will learn a tremendous amount about how they all came together, and eventually how and why they drifted apart.  Over 600 minutes of footage will probably make for overkill for those only mildly interested in the band, but then again the story is so well put together you may find yourself with a renewed curiosity about and interest in the Beatles as well.

Candid interviews with Paul, George, Ringo, producer George Martin, and long-time associates such as Neil Aspinal point out both the highs and lows of the Beatles' days on tour, in the studio, and through some of their personal misadventures. The early episodes are full of terrific live footage of the band, whereas later episodes feature many of the proto-""music videos"" the band produced when they no longer toured.

The bonus dvd, which includes material that was not broadcast on TV before, includes some great stuff as well. There are interviews with the production staff on how the Anthology was put together, more interviews and scenes with Paul, George, and Ringo, and my favorite part, which features them with George Martin playing back some old tapes at Abbey Road studio. It's fascinating to learn about how a track like ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" was put together, and the clips on the bonus dvd have a more relaxed and less formal feel than on the official ""Anthology"".

This production is definitely focused on the music of the band and their creative process. Very little is mentioned of their personal lives (wives, children, scandals, etc), no doubt a result of this being an ""authorized"" production. I found it interesting to read Peter Brown's ""The Love You Make"" at the same time I was watching this documentary, for Peter's book fills in a great many details only skimmed over here. Still, this is only a minor quibble, as there is only so much that can be covered in even this many hours about the Beatles, and in the end it is the music that matters most, not who married or divorved who and when.

All in all this is a terrific document on one of--if not THE--most important bands ever in pop/rock music.",1105660800,2,2298,4.778337531486146

Yeah, they fought at the end. Ringo explained it best,when he commented on why the group broke apart. They all wanted to do different things in Music,other than ""being a Beatle"". I cannot agree that this was all slanted toward Paul,and John was largely ignored. Let us all remember that John had been gone for over 10 years when this came about. There is no real credit given to Yoko Ono, but I am afraid she was used too much as a source. Face facts,people....Yoko was not liked when John brought her to all the sessions,by the rest,and it showed in their last recordings, with the exception of Abbey Road.

After watching it a few times though,I've became aware of how John Lennon is shorted in the editing. In the early live concerts you get plenty of Paul and George harmonizing but John is way over to the side,almost not seen. More of Pauls early songs are included,when everyone knows John dominated this period. The cuts throughout the whole set that include John seem to be those that cast him into the worst light. We all know Paul is trying to re-write history by casting himself as the real leader of the Beatles,we also know he was more of a domineering snit with lousy ideas. By merely surviving Lennon he can now edit and slant and re-mix classics so that they cast him in the best light. Everyone knows Paul falls short of John and George in his solo work,when the Beatles stopped,so did he,but he keeps pounding out these same old crappy ditties acting like we must all love them because of who he once was. In the Anthology he treats George Harrison like he's an idiot,some things never change despite the passage of time. Yet in one scene he looks at him knowing that Harrisons solo work makes his own pale in comparison. He seems nervous around George,no wonder,all the crappy things he said and done to the man,and yet,here he is,an equal,no longer just a guitar player but an equal in the songwriting department. Paul tells the viewer many times""I'm a big fan of Johns"",but he doesn't say the same of George or Ringo. I enjoyed watching this Series just for the unsaid things,the interaction between Paul and George,for as long as George was living Paul could not get away with his revisionist re-write of the groups efforts. Now that George is gone I'm afraid all Beatle fans will suffer at the hands of this pompous tyrant. If John were here he would just tell him to shut up.",1099267200,10,1900,4.558479532163743

Well, in the first place, the live footage, the sound quality, the interviews, the performances in a lot fo TV shows and stadiums, etc are simply BREATHTAKING. The quality of the images and sound are marvellous, they obviousl spent a lof of time in the stuidos remastering theses things. It's a HUGE work, and the result was stupendous. A lot on previoulsy unseen footage, I assure you. Also, the documentary flows smootly, it's really enjoyable to watch, and I doubt if you will not drop a few tears at the end of disc four (Chapter Eight)... This alone deserves five stars, it's above anything else in the ""band documentary"" business...

Now, let's talk about the content a little bit. That's where the problem is. The whole thing was produced by the BEatles themselves, adn they CLEARLY avoided tricky subjects. In a way, this was good, otherwise the documentary would seem like a bunch of gossip put together, or tocuhing wounds that were inflicted decades ago... Totally unecessary. However, things were a little too much superficial at times. It's clear that band members are avoiding to heart each other or say something wrong. There is no interview with the band's wives or girlfriends; no interview with famous ""almost famous"" drummer Pete Best; no real sense of the amazing deterioration in the band inter relationship before the break. The message the documentary passes is: ""everything was alright, but things must change, we were all married, we had to split;"" All Beatles fans know that this was not the truth. Paul, Ringo and George talk briefly about the ""Yono Factor"", and it's interesting to see how she really was present in EVERY rehearsal and recording that is shown in the documentary (after she met John, of course!)

All of these ""complains"" are minimum flaws, in my opinion, or are not flaws at all! The BEatles recognize that they were playing worse, because nobdy could hear them; there is footage of George and Paul having a falling out (and that's how we can sse these guys really loevd each other - even when arguing, they mantain their class); they admit they used drugs (altough they Beatles never used drugs to the extend that some artists take, to the point of compromising their performances, their capacity to play, or wahtever).

801602,5,630416923X,"I have to admit right off the bat that this is going to be an extremely biased review.  Why?  Because I am obsessed with the Beatles, and this boxed set includes more information than I could ever dream of.  My only previous experience with the Anthology (aside from the CDs, of course) was when it was shown on ABC in late 1995, I believe.  If I'm not mistaken, it was only about half the length we have now.  We follow them from their Liverpool childhoods, to their years as the Quarrymen, onto their Hamburg days, dropping Pete Best, acquiring Ringo Starr, and finally set to take on America.  And that's just on the first disc!  There's three more where that came from, and in quick succession we hear about anything and everything related to the Fab Four, from the songs to the personalities, from John's Jesus comments to the bed-in for peace.  The only problem I have is that the final four years are sort of glossed over rather quickly on the last disc, and we get precious little information about their post-Beatle careers; after all, if we include pre-Beatle stuff, why not the aftermath?

But that's just an obsessive fan's complaint towards an otherwise spectacular anthology.  The special features take up the fifth and final disc, although they are not as plentiful as one might have hoped for.  We get the ""Real Love"" music video, a featurette on the making of the ""Free As A Bird"" video (which is featured at the end of the fourth disc, at the end of the whole shebang), a couple of little singalongs between Paul, George and Ringo (one in George's garden estate, one at the studio), and featurettes on how they picked which songs would go on the Anthology albums and how they recorded the two new songs.  Finally, we get a little segment where the DVD producers talk about making the Anthology TV series.

The film:  5 stars.

The extras:  4 stars.",1091836800,4,1866,4.59214501510574
801603,5,630416923X,"At 11 years old, my biggest interests were horses, painting and drawing horses, reading books about horses and avoiding homework. Then, one November Sunday night, I wanted to watch tv and there was nothing on but The Beatles Anthology, I was too lazy to turn the set off. AND IT'S A GOOD THING I DIDN'T!!! At the end of two hours, I was off to bed singing ""Love Me Do"" and begging to watch the second installment the night it came on. It was heartbreak when I missed the 3rd and final installment on Thanksgiving night but by Christmas, I was 12 years old and the proud owner of my first boombox and my first CD ever: The Beatles Anthology 1.

 That was 9 years ago and I'm even crazier about The Beatles than I was then. I've even converted my best friends and my latest boyfriend into Beatles fans! It was also interesting to see my parents watching the local news the next night and seeing literally HUNDREDS of teenagers lined up outside the music stores in the Mall to buy Beatles albums!

 Oh, and don't get me wrong, I still love my horses (I'm training them now) and am pursuing an art career in college, I still love to read (I have several books about The Beatles) and am now trying to write a novel; but my love of The Beatles has never faded. The airing of The Beatles Anthology unleashed a second tide of Beatlemania that has yet to fade. In fact, they are still among the Top Ten searches on ebay. The Beatles also ignited my love of 60's and 70's music and culture and I am now among the hundreds of 20-somethings on my campus who are the latest of worshippers at the altars of the likes of: Jimmy Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and the solo career of John Lennon. We can now find common ground with the Baby Boomer/Old Hippy Professors on our campus and, even our parents!

 Ah, but back to my story. In my 13th year, The Beatles Anthology aired AGAIN, proof of its undying popularity. This time, I was prepared, and had enough VHS tape to record all three nights, sans commercials. My allowance, sadly, was not large enough to purchase the whole set of VHS tapes and my parents deemed them too expensive for a present. So, I continued to watch my home recordings as they faded more and more from continual use. Then, (hallelujah!) the DVDs were released! I was finally able to see the Anthology in its entirety, and for a much better price than the $130 out-of-publication VHS tapes.

 This set is NOT a letdown! And, it has the added bonus of extra material (the video for ""Real Love"", behind the scenes production, etc.) that the VHS tapes didn't have. The story of how The Beatles came to be is a real inspiration for me. I love the tale of how they all came to know each other and it was very interesting to learn of their backgrounds, the music that influenced each of them, how they got their name (like the Crickets, but Beat, like Beat Music) and the truly HORRIBLE living and traveling conditions they had to endure (broken windshield while traveling down a highway in the middle of winter in leather clothes, the horrible accommodations when they first arrived in Hamburg, and other stories). Their climb to success was long, hard and at times, disgruntling. But by the time John was 24, they were in America and loved all over the world!

 The Beatles had 27 Number One Hits in the space of SIX years! That is UNPRESIDENTED! Plus, they occupied the top FIVE spots of the Hits chart all at once, a record that had never happened before or since. Even when the Anthology aired, for weeks before, ABC broadcasting was advertising their station as ""A Beatle C"", even the local news anchors were being interviewed about who their favorite Beatle was. And, in the Friday Night programs called TGIF, their regular theme songs were replaced with BEATLES songs! I mean, no one band must be bigger, more famous or more loved to deserve all that hype! And I must say, I believe in that statement.

 The Beatles have influenced my artwork (just hearing their music brings all kinds of WONDERFUL abstract images into my head), like John Lennon always did, I now dream in Technicolor, and also like him, I don't need drugs to do it! He stated that it was always like that for him, he didn't know any other way to dream and at that point, he hadn't ever touched drugs. And despite their drug use, you have to respect The Beatles, they never used while they were recording (except once by accident) so even their was always done sober. AND, they give me hope that I WILL be able to make it with my own brand of art, the key is to NEVER give up on what you love to do, NO MATTER *WHAT* ANYONE TELLS YOU! (ex. John's Aunt Mimi: ""You'll never make a living playing a guitar, John."")

 But, honestly, this is a GREAT set, The Beatles are a fantastic, original and NEVER-outdated band. They were the Four Horsemen of the 60's, they changed and influenced that decade in too many ways to name, they influenced the course of ALL genres of music forever, and they were always on the cutting edge of ingenuity, creativity and originality. Their sound was so NEW and Different from anything ever heard before, OR since! And because of that, their music will always remain TIMELESS and in a class ALL its own.",1091404800,6,5215,4.464285714285714

 ""The Beatles Anthology"" is a VERY nice, almost fawning, portrayal of the Beatles, and their bitter and sometimes even hate-filled breakup is made to look like a friendly mutual decision where everybody loooooooves each other and just want to move on with their lives, yadayadayada.

 The fact that comments from the three surviving Beatles (anno 1996-97) and their various associates are never commented upon or analyzed in any way makes ""The Beatles Anthology"" a bit of a bland experience at times...some sort of unbiased commentary (other than various newscasters in old 60s TV clips) would have been nice.

 As it is, ""Anthology"" just rolls along, a bit monotously, offering a pleasant, often entertaining look at the career of the Beatles, but never analyzing or explaining or commenting or just seeing things in a larger context, and that's really a shame.",1091145600,26,955,5.089743589743589

There were concerts, interviews with the three remaining Beatles at the time, music videos, clips from their wonderful movies, and oh so much more.

Plus, because each Beatle has a different personality, you get a mostly objective view. Paul is always trying to smooth arguments and rivalry over, George is cynical about the 60's in general, Ringo is friendly, and John (taken from past interviews) is always inciteful.
It was very interesting and it kept my attention throughout the entire 8 hour film. One thing I wish they had done was focus more time for the later years as a band (IMO when they made their best music), but it is hurried a bit.

801680,3,630416923X,"although its very well made and i did enjoy it, i feel like so much was skipped over..lots of details about the Beatles and their lives..many things were left out..
-talking about early member Stu Sutcliffes death
-more insight into Brian Epstiens vision when he became manager
-dealing with the Beatles in their times and thier relationships with contemporaries (the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys etc.)
Mick Jagger appears many times throughout the documentary but no mention ever about the 2 bands rivalries which is a compelling  part of the story
-little talk of the musical progression from the early years through the more complex ablums and how the band got there
-absolutley no mention of their relationships with their wives girlfreinds etc. til disc 8 when they couldn't avoid the ""Yoko situation""
-very little talk of thier song writing progress, weve all heard the songs a million times and loved them..but over 8 dvds some stories about the inspiration for songs or how they came about would have been great..(there are a few, Dear Prudence, Hey Jude..but far too few)
-the recording process, no talk of the mess the let it be sessions were and how Phil Spector came in and cleaned things up so to speak
-failure to discuss the fact that Let It Be was released after Abbey Road
-the breakup, the solos albums, etc..all very much glossed over
overall if your a fan id recommend the Anthology, the perforance and news reel footage is great, but it seems like the ""story"" of the Beatles and their lives is a bit watered down and could have been delved into even more
for my money still the best documentary ive seen on the beatles is The Complete Beatles..about 6 hours shorter but for some reason i didn't get much more out of the 81/2 hr Anthology than i did from the Complete Beatles documentary

801683,5,630416923X,"A ten hour documentary? Produced by the band's own company? How can that be good?
Well, it is. One could reasonably expect that certain sordid details would be glossed over, but for the most part, they are here, along with incredible footage, new interviews, classic performances, home movies, and incredible 5.1 surround sound remixes of the songs in the soundtrack. Hearing ""Something"" or ""A Day in the Life"" in surround sound is a remarkable experience.
So, let's talk quality and bonus features.
The video quality is superb, and shows no issues of PAL to NTSC conversion, a remarkable feat considering how many dvds seem to mess this up lately. The picture is very sharp, and the encode seems to have been done at a very high rate, so there is simply no apparent artifacting.
The sound is perfect. I can't imagine how many hours of effort must have gone into remixing everything for this presentation, but it must have been an effort.
The bonus features are okay. We get to see the whole Threetle's jam session, with George getting impatient with the whole project. The two bonus videos are nice to have, it's especially nice to finally have the Real Love video. There are also some interviews in the studio that are a bit illuminating.
The set is absolutely worth your time, even if you already have the VHS or Laserdisc versions.",1076716800,6,1335,4.758620689655173

It's not only a great documentary with lots of rare footage of the boys, but its damn funny too.  George (when he can remember them) and Paul often have very different versions of stories, and Ringo seems so genuinely nice and like he really enjoyed his ride as a Beatle, possibly more than the other guys.  I gave it five stars - how can you not after watching ten hours and enjoying every second?  However, I do have a serious problem with the re-editing that went on from the TV airing to the DVD.  My friend and I noticed several differences - mostly scenes featuring the three ""present day"" Beatles being left off the DVD.  Why do this when they added so much additional footage for the DVD? I know hardly anyone else will be bugged by this, but they happened to be funny scenes, which is why we remembered them from watching the anthology on television.

This anthology has managed to give me a much deeper appreciation of the band that changed rock music as we know it. Hearing the stories behind some of my favorite songs gives me a whole new outlook on the music.
As for my girlfriend, it has definitely renewed her interest in the band she loves so much.

801790,5,630416923X,"I think the DVD is actually cheaper than the VHS set when it came out, and that didn't even have the extras!!

This is the authorized video bio of The Beatles, the band that turned the world on its ear in the early 60s until 1970 when they broke up.

A lot is covered in the 4 discs, where they grew up, how they got together, the (mis)adventures they went on, the bonding and humor that got them threw the storm known as Beatlemania, the drug use, the women, and the eventual breakup.

You can tell the interviews were done over a number of years, and  because Lennon had done a number of lengthy interviews, we are lucky to be able to hear his voice throughout the film. We see George in various states of facial hair and hair length, Paul getting ready for a show and driving a boat, Ringo kicking it on the west coast as well as the ""Threetles"" hanging in George's backyard and in a kitchen, talking like old war buddies. Yoko is interviewed here and there, as is producer George Martin. In a way, you kind of wish the other Beatle girlfriends/wives were involved because they were there when it was going on, and would have been able to give a different take on it.

John Lennon's ""Imagine"" has been recently released on DVD and is worth watching after this, even if just for the Beatles era. ""Wingspan"" goes into Paul's solo career, and ""Concert For Bangladesh"" might not be a documentary but it is a great concert that was just released.

The heart of this collection, in between the stories, is the music itself as well as the promotional films (Before they called them music videos). The Ed Sullivan footage is readily available on its own, but the Shea Stadium footage calls for a full-length release, it looks amazing, and the ""Strawberry Fields"" footage also looks great when having seen grainy bootleg versions.

The down side is that the songs are not easily accessible (on purpose?) and at times there is narration over them, or they're not shown completely. Something like ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" was considered groundbreaking, why not show it from beginning to end? The ""Let It Be"" footage also looked fantastic, far better than what they had released on video years ago.

Because it's the ""authorized"" story, you're not going to get the gossipy salacious stuff that has been brought up over the years, but at times the language from time to time is not for young children.

The documentary is a lot to digest in one sitting, but here and there it's a great story. The extras are great but one wishes there was more of it. It would have been nice had they put just concert and promo footage just the same.

Between this, the book, ""The First US Visit"", the movies,the Anthology 1-3 CDs as well as the CDs of their catalog, you get to see and hear the story the way they intended it to be told.",1067299200,,2814,4.510805500982318

While there have been dozens of attempts to tell the Beatles'incredible story throughout the years, this anthology is the most complete. To call it a documentary would be an understatement, there is simply so much history and material here 5 discs almost seem skimpy. For us music lovers, this is a must, the bulk of the Shea Stadium Concert is here (is there a moment more magical than Ed Sullivan introducing the band and watching the kids go berserk when the boys come running out onto the field and take to the stage?), or watching a year later as they perform ""Nowhere Man"" live, very accurately but clearly very tired (just watch Ringo's face and posture)and one of my favorite sequences, the full clips of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane"" (check the matching red coats and the new longer hair and mustaches!), the recording sessions for ""Get Back"" (as a Black man, it's a trip to see my family friend Billy Preston hanging around Twikenham Studios chatting with The Fab Four, but he was there!)right down to the final, very moving clip of ""Something"" with the guys all cavorting with their wives in some beautiful pastoral settings, no longer a band, but 4 men who have grown up together, conquered the world and are now ready to go their separate ways. We all know that the end of the band wasn't happy or even civil, but this seems an appropriate way to close that particular chapter. The updated recollections by the surviving band members (George's are very poignant, especially now) are priceless since time, history and age have given them fresh perspective and Paul's in depth commentary on their creative process (LP covers, photography, musical direction etc.)is quite candid.

They're rather humble, and they aren't sociologists anyway.  There are only 2 flaws: first is that there is such a lack of post-Beatles Lennon footage -- he did some good TV interviews, and only snippets appear here.  Second is that this could have been an ""Exhaustive"" collection by presenting ALL the music videos these guys did.  But then perhaps that's the NEXT project on the Apple agenda.  Let's hope so.

If the DVD set has one shortcoming, it is in the presentation of the video footage.  I would have personally enjoyed watching the music videos in their entirety.  Only clips were shown of some live footage, and I would have liked to have seen the entire song performed. Also, the interviewees were speaking and sometimes shown during the music videos and live performances, a great annoyance.  It was like watching MTV's TRL at some points, with only a shortened version of a video while someone is talking.
Overall, the DVD collection is absolutely fantastic and well worth its price.  A great companion to the DVD is The Beatles Anthology book.  It provides twice as much information as the DVD and is a compelling read. To understand the Beatles in their own words, both are essential as the DVD leaves out much of the book, but the DVD also has information the book doesn't.",1061510400,,1155,4.808080808080808

This gives THE complete history of the world's greatest rock and roll band, the ones who started it all, the originals who have been often imitated but never duplicated.

After watching the entire Anthology, you think you've watch the evolvement of two different bands.  It was one band from 1964-1966, the height of Beatlemania, when they toured the world and did live (and taped) appearances on nearly every country's major shows (e.g. The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops).  From late-1966, after their final concert in San Francisco, to the end, they were a completely different band.

It was interesting to learn that one of the reasons why they stopped touring, besides the screaming that made it impossible for them to hear themselves playing, was because the songs were becoming increasingly difficult to duplicate onstage, showing their growth as musicians.  They broke barriers and brand new territory with Sgt. Pepper.

In the end, this Anthology is the be all and end all of everything the Fab Four and is a must have for any serious fan.  It was refreshing to hear the truth directly from the source.",1061251200,2,1236,4.765258215962441

801948,5,630416923X,"This could possibly be the toughest item I've ever tried to review.  Why?  Because words alone could not describe the magic that blossomed from this quartet from Liverpool.  One needs to take this set of discs, sit down for 10 hours and watch the series in its entirety.  That is the only true way to appreciate the Beatles' story, life and music.

That said, there is plenty here to satisfy even the most dedicated fans.  You will see concerts and interviews, home movies and newsreels, and the beauty of it is, you will not find this stuff anywhere else (except bootlegs, of course).

There are many exciting moments found in this set.  Here are some of my personal favorite moments:

*1962 - ""Some Other Guy"" from the Cavern Club
*1964 - ""She Loves You"" from Washington DC
*1964 - ""All My Loving"" from the Hollywood Bowl
*1965 - ""I'm Down"" from Shea Stadium
*1966 - ""Rock and Roll Music"" from Japan
*1968 - ""Revolution"" from the Smothers Brothers Show
*1969 - ""Get Back"" from the Apple Rooftop

Another aspect of the Beatles Anthology is that, sprinked throughout the series, you will find musicians other than the Beatles singing either Beatles songs, or songs that influenced the Beatles.  For example, the Rolling Stones singing ""I Wanna Be Your Man,"" Bob Dylan singing ""The Times They Are A-Changing,"" or Jimi Hendrix singing ""Sgt. Pepper.""  These are very interesting.

One more thing that absolutely thrills me is that during two moments in the series (Washington DC and Japan), fan-shot footage is substituted for the footage that everybody knows.  You will not find that ANYWHERE else.  It is moments  like these that put me in Heaven every time I watch them.

The Beatles pervaded politics, religion, economics and lifestyles world-wide( although not everybody agrees with them) -- yet, their greatest impact is still the intensity and timelessness of their music: Yesterday, In my Life, Twist and Shout, Help, Strawberry Fields Forever, A Day in the Life, I-me-mine,etc.  with the 5.1 DTS system bringing them to life like no other.
The DVD contains encyclopedic trivia that may not be so trivial to die-hard fans: ""When I'm 64"", was written by John when he was 16; Eleanor Rigby's name came from a Tombstone, etc.; No, it's not true that the Beatles are more popular than Jesus; Yes, they snubbed the Marcoses but not the people; Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is not that, and more.

802015,5,630416923X,"This DVD set is, by far, the definitive video document of the rise and fall of what is arguably the greatest band to ever crank out a tune.  From their humble roots as children in Liverpool, through the early years as a quintet (without Ringo Starr, mind you) touring as naive teens in Hamburg, their rise to world superstardom, and what would eventually turn out to be one of the most devastating and painful breakups in rock history...it's all here.  The entire story is told in the words of the Beatles themselves, offering not just a basic history lesson, but true insight into what was going on behind the scenes in terms of thoughts, reasons, and emotions.  When I finished watching this incredible 10+ hours of video, I felt that I truly understood not only what the Fab Four were all about, but how they personally experienced the times as well.
  Having been born just late enough to have actually lived through the Beatlemania period, without being able to really appreciate what was going on around me, I found ""Anthology"" to be not only entertaining and informative, but very ""memory intensive"".  Events that I only vaguely remember being on television finally come alive with all the details that my young mind couldn't quite comprehend at the time.  I was, after all, only 6, when the Beatles played Candlestick Park, a mere 10 miles from my home.  But once I became a fan, just about the time they broke up, I was pretty much absorbed into the legend.
  Technically, this set is one of the best I own.  The EXTENSIVE concert footage (covering the entire span of their group career) put me right there with the band for some of the most memorable live performances ever recorded.  The overwhelming majority of footage is crystal clear, and edited very well, giving a true concert feel.  And remixing all the cuts into 5.1 surround has brought out some of the incredible detail of The Beatles' music...some of which is sadly missing from the CD versions of the same songs!
  I would have willingly paid twice what I did for this set, and still would have been ecstatic with the results.  Superior story, fantastic footage, and awesome audio make this THE collection to own, whether you are a diehard Beatles fan, or just want to find out what all the fuss was about.

802016,5,630416923X,"This is a follow up review, as I just finished my review of Ringorama, and it reminded me of the saddest part of the anthology collection, in which there are many obviously sad parts....
When you watch disc 5, when the boys are together, and you can see Sir Paul still can't prevent himself from dominating everyone, (not because he's bad, but because he never realized it was happening) there is a short comment by Ring when he says he likes hanging out with them.....
Ringo was always the base upon which the Beatles rotated, although I'm sure they never realized it, especially with all their talent, it would be hard to see how this simple, beautiful man could be the center of the Beatle Universe, but it was always the simple and willing Ringo that allowed the others to shine so brightly...
Well, watch that short comment someday with this in mind:
Here was the one person in the whole universe who was allowed into the greatest ride in musical history, who was enjoying it as much as the audience...Ringo was a fan of the Beatles as much as we were, and much more than John, Paul and George, who WERE the Beatles...who provided the songs and the personalities and lived in that horrible spotlight, and eventually suffered from it....
Steady old Ringo, he was like us, watching what was happening to his friends, powerless to help them, but sheilded from the creative demands and ego that accompanies it....no less than any of the others, and just as important because he was the base from which the others sprang...in some ways an impossible job of ducking the fights and the siding with one or the other, but loving this gift given him by the Good Lord.....to be a Beatle....
So watch Ring tell them, for all of us, that he liked hanging out with them, and then dry your eyes, and know that at least one Beatle knows your saddness, and carries it much deeper, and much harder than any of us......

802020,4,630416923X,"I borrowed this DVD from my brother to see if I felt I would watch it more then once before buying it.  If you're a knowledgeable Beatles fan you know most of the story's they tell already.  They've said most of this in interviews over the years or others have written about it.  The only difference is you're hearing the same old stories directly out of the Beatles' mouths.  There's not much that they reveal that wasn't already known.
Having said that I always find the Beatles' story inspiring.  Four lower middle class lads with basically high school educations band together and take over the world.  It's a timeless story which always reinforces the theory that if you follow your dreams, work hard enough and maybe with a little luck you can accomplish anything.  The rags to riches storyline happens over and over again in rock and roll history, but for some reason the Beatles' story always stands alone.  They weren't the first to live the story, but they are the yardstick which all others are measured against.  Maybe it was the innocence of the times, maybe it was the positive message of their music or maybe it was just four lads having a laugh and letting the whole world join in on the fun.  Is there a song on the radio today as much fun as 'She Loves You'?  Everytime I hear it, 40 years on(!!!!), I still get caught up in the exuberance of the boys' performances.  They sound like they're having a ball and it comes across, still.  Timeless.
So the question is...do you buy it?  I'd suggest renting it or borrowing it unless you've 'just gotta have it'.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  There is a minor EQing problem where whenver they go to any performance footage the sound gets really loud, but the sound quality overall is great.  The bonus DVD is basically Paul, George and Ringo sitting around chatting in the mid-nineties, them goofing around jamming on acoustic guitars on oldies and them with George Martin in Abbey Road commenting on old songs. While it's nice to see them together and getting along I don't think it's worth buying the whole package just for this.

802124,5,630416923X,"Compiled after John Lennon's death (but before Harrison's), it is amazing how this 12-hour documentary seems to capture his personality, presence, and participation. The thoughtful (and at times playful) editing of mucho miles of archival film and recent interview footage makes it possible to feel like each Beatle received equal attention. Perhaps because John was often the group's spokesperson during their heyday, he is amply represented by talkshow clips (including an interview with a very young David Frost).
Because the film covers only the decade in which the Beatles were the Beatles (post-Beatles careers are not discussed or analyzed), but does so from a 30+ year vantage point, the film serves as a very interesting study on memory. The surviving Beatles remember events (recording sessions, concerts, conversations, etc.) quite differently, and there is no impartial third-party commentator to enlighten the audience. It is very much like being at a family reunion--it's the quality and depth of the relationships that count, not the accuracy of the events recalled. In some cases, however, original footage contradicts a Beatle's memory. It is these lapses of memory, the humble and honest self-assessments, the willingness to forgive, the cherishing of what exisited and was special, and a mature perspective on fame and success that make this film a joy to watch. It's gratifying that Paul, George, and Ringo did not become like the ""late Elvis"" (a fear they admit to in the film). Yes, they became a little mellow with age. But they didn't cease to be interesting, thoughtful, or creative.
This film is accurately called an ""anthology."" The archival footage is generous. In most cases two or more full songs from a single concert are captured. And there are generous clips from all of their movies. Also of interest are the mini-films the Beatles made when they later tired of touring. They sent these films to television shows in their stead, allowing them to stay home with their growing families and avoid the screaming fans. In essence, they invented the music-video, a mainstay of the pop music industry today.
Towards the end of Part 8, the final segment, Paul observes that ""looking back, almost every song was about love. That's a very positive thing. You can't argue with that, right?"" The Beatles were revolutionary in so many ways, but they were never nihilists.",1051315200,,2392,5.151670951156812

Of course, the picture quality is great. This is the format in which you will get the very best video of the old concert footage and interviews.
However, what really blew me away about the set is the audio. It is truly fantastic. Hearing all those great songs in 5.1 surround sound sends shivers up your spine. Take 'I Am the Walrus' for example. In the original stereo recording, the song switches to 'fake' stereo half way through due to recording limitations of the time. However, in this remix, the song is presented in 5.1 all the way through. Fantastic!!
Every song has been remixed in the same careful way.
The features on the 5th dics are very interesting and entertaining. The only thing I would have wished for would have been more concert footage, perhaps the entire Shea Stadium or Washington concerts.

It's amazing to think that here in Australia it's release wasn't anywhere as heavily promoted as a cheaper rivalling 5 DVD set called ""The Long And Winding Road"". It just snuck out. I only found out by chance on a news radio item about the extra '95 footage. I had to come to Amazon just to get some basic details. That said, it's beeen worth the wait. You haven't heard ""Penny Lane"" and ""A Day in the Life"" until you've heard them in glorious 5.1 sound. just crank it up. If you want the DEFINITIVE Beatles story, go straight to the horse's mouth. All the little insights, legends, myths and other annecdotes are told here. The performances bring a tear to the eye on occasion. I was a child growing up with the Beatles and they had a major influence on my life. Paul & John met on July 6 1957, 2 days after I was born. Exactly 10 years later to the day, they were performing ""All You Need Is Love"" for the world to see. The Beatles certainly came along brilliantly from those early scratchy recordings in their youth.
The extra features are great to watch. The making of the ""Free As A Bird"" clip is wonderful. Did anybody out there realise that George played the ukelele bit at the end of that same track. I applaud the inclusion of the ""Real Love"" clip as well though it's probably not as innovative as ""Free As A Bird"". Abbey Road revisited reminded me of an episode of the ""Classic Albums"" series. Methinks it's time to do A Beatle album for that series too (Revolver/Rubber Soul/""White Album""/Abbey Road - take your pick - Pepper was done in ""The Making Of Sgt. Pepper"" documentary). I digress. If you're a fan or even if you're not it's worth the price. You will laugh and cry and marvel at the music, especially the stuff that WASN'T released.

802210,5,630416923X,"Not to be mean, but I am not the least bit interested in trying to convince people who are still ""on-the-fence"" about the Beatles' greatness to buy this DVD package. If they don't comprehend that the Beatles were and still are the greatest musical entity ever (they're much more than just a band), than no one can help them. No, I call upon everyone who, like myself, just plain get it. The Beatles are the greatest and so is this DVD compilation. I've read all these reviews and some have said the picture is grainy and not as good as it can be.  Totally untrue. If you see a grainy picture when watching this anthology, you need either a new TV or a new DVD player.  My images were beautiful across the board, old and new.  The sound is also fantastic. Trust me, I know every note of every Beatles recording and the sound reproduction is brilliant. The editing, production and content of this set is mind-blowing. Another complaint I heard was there was too much material!  Too much??  The more the merrier. Whatever you don't like, skip over. I loved it all. I'm a late night person and I watched two episodes a night and the time flew by.  I hated to turn it off to go to bed! Please don't believe the negative reviews (not that there are very many). This anthology has no negatives. If you don't have it, get it immediately, period.",1050278400,5,1337,4.414634146341464
802211,5,630416923X,"Back in January 2000, I reviewed this box set here (see ""If You Liked the TV Special, You'll Love This!""). 3 years later, many Beatles fans' prayers (including my own) have been answered with the release of this video library in DVD form. Rather than resay what I said back then, I just thought I'd write with a different perspective. The opening statement is from the liner notes of Derek Taylor, who served as the Beatles' press agent.
To answer a recent review, here's what's on it: performances of the Beatles live in concert and television performances (not complete concerts), some original videos, narrated by Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, the late George Harrison (who was still around during the making of this documentary) and the late John Lennon (his comments are culled by old interviews), excerpts from early recordings, studio outtakes, press conferences and all 5 of their movies and finally, over 30 complete Beatles tracks (By the way, ""Real Love"" is included in this edition).
The sound quality is superior here than the original VHS (and you have the option of LPCM Stereo, Dolby Digital surround sound and DTS 5.1 surround sound). You also have the option of subtitles in English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese (Brazilian and European). Just don't expect your Linguistics teachers to be impressed with how many French or Spanish words you learned while watching this!
It is a bit of a shame that individual tracks weren't assembled for complete songs. Oh well, a minour disappointment! Keep in mind that the 8 video VHS box set was actually pricier than the 5 DVD box set back when it was released in 1996 (I remember paying over [money] for mine!).
Then of course, there's the Special Features DVD. In addition to the ""Real Love"" video (which wasn't included on the original VHS edition), there's a segment in which Paul, George and Ringo all gather together in 1994 to discuss the old days and jam out on old songs. The 3 are also featured here in 1995 discussing with George Martin, their producer, the choosing of different outtakes on the 3 Anthology CD's and studio techniques they used during the original recording sessions. Paul, George and Ringo also discuss with Jeff Lynne how a Beatles mini-""reunion"" took place with 2 John Lennon demos (""Free As a Bird"" and ""Real Love""). Also, there's a section on how many hours of interviews and classic footage came together for this documentary and a feature on how the ""Free as a Bird"" video was made.
Give yourself at least 2 weeks to enjoy as Derek Taylor once put it these ""10 hours of unchallengable evidence"" of the Beatles' legacy, which continues even to this day.",1050278400,263,2667,4.850877192982456
802212,5,630416923X,"I've been a Beatles fan for about 6 years now, I'm very familiar with their later stuff, somewhat familiar with the early stuff...
That having been said, this documentary is absolutely amazing.  I used it as 11 hours of background noise while doing spring cleaning, and i'm now going back to watch the good parts.  THE FULL ROOF-TOP CONCERT!!  THREE FULL SONGS FROM SHEA STADIUM.  BOTH FULL SONGS FROM THE FIRST ED SULLIVAN APPEARANCE.  FULL MUSIC VIDEOS FOR PENNY LANE, DAY IN THE LIFE AND MANY OTHERS...
This is what sets this documentary apart...the Beatles were documented at the time like no one else, and this set takes full advantage of the existing material as well as multiple lenghty interviews with George, Paul, Ringo and George Martin to create an absolute anthology of the life of The Beatles.
...The first episode alone is about the four guys growing up in Liverpool, getting their first instruments and such.  The beauty of DVD, you can skip it.  I think it's good background that enhances anyone's appreciation of the band, but I've been able to watch the Shea Stadium performance numerous times without slogging through Paul's baby pictures too much...",1050278400,,1170,4.908629441624366

I dare you to find such footage of any other band.

802215,5,630416923X,"So much to say, so little space.  Of course, I bought the VHS version when it came out in 1996, and it was great. I thought, even back then, that the sound was a bit disappointing, a bit thin.  When I found out it was coming out on DVD, I was somewhat apprehensive.  After all, A Hard Day's Night was a tremendous disappointment, sound wise.  It was hyped to be in 5.1 Surround, but was actually mono, and hollow, thin mono to boot.
So I started with the bonus disc, and I was absolutely blown away.  You get extensive footage of the three together, talking, reminising, playing (WOW!).  You got a bit of that in the original anthology, but just in snippets.  Now, you really get a sense of their time together on this, and of them working together on the two new songs.  Plus, you get, for the first time, the Real Love video mixed in 5.1 Surround.  Absolutely incredible!!!
This is 81 minutes of pure heaven for the Beatles fan, and this DVD alone is worth the price of the set.  There really are no words that can do it justice.  One can't help but imagine what it would have been like had John Lennon still been alive when they did this.
Then I worked my way through the original Anthology.  Over the years, I've watched the Anthology a number of times, so I'm fairly familiar with the material, and the sound, which, as I mentioned, I thought a bit thin on the VHS version.  As I put on the first DVD, I told myself not to overexpect, that they probably just took the sound from the VHS and transferred it to DVD.
Well, I was wrong!!!  Almost all of the music has been remixed in true 5.1 Surround.  I couldn't believe it!!  Of course, the picture quality is outstanding, but I expected that (however, there are segments where certain cuts of video are very dirty, and I don't really understand that).
But it's the music that really blew me away.  Some of the biggest surprises:
1. A TRUE surround stereo remix of I Am The Walrus, FROM BEGINNING TO END!!!  I always thought that in the middle of the song, where it switches to rechanneled stereo on the original, it was impossible to ever get a stereo mix becuase they took sounds from a live radio broadcast during mixdown.  But even the radio broadcast is panned from left to right in the rear speakers.  Also, the strings and horns are in stereo, and believe me, I've heard things I've NEVER heard before...and I bet I've listened to that song a thousand times.
2. At the very end of the Anthology, there is a short snippet of Sie Liebt Dich, IN TRUE STEREO, with one guitar in either channel.  Maybe there's still a chance we will get to hear a decent stereo version of She Loves You.
3. A sadly too short edit of Got To Get You Into My Life.  Any audiophile Beatles fan knows that on the original stereo version, Ringo drums are pretty much buried in the left channel.  On this remix, Ringo's drums are FRONT AND CENTER and MUCH LOUNDER!!!  I got goosebumps on the tom roll that I always struggled to hear.  As I said, such a pity it is so short.
I'm only giving three highlights of an unending parade of Beatle songs, mostly edits, that surprise with the Surround remix.  It's an unbelievably wonderful experience.
I'm not neccessarily advocating releasing all the Beatles' music in 5.1 Surround, but what this shows is that the quality of the sound we've been hearing on the old CDs is woefully inadequate.  All the songs from Revolver that are featured here are simply an incredible upgrade in sound from the CD; there is no comparision.
As great as this DVD set is, in the final analysis, what the Beatles were really about is the music.  Capital/EMI, it is time that you stepped up to the plate and give us Beatles fans what we deserve: the absolute best stereo sound that is now available.  We now know, thanks to this DVD, how much better our precious Beatles albums can sound.  We are counting on you to finally deliver it.
For the fans, if you thought that paying one hundred bucks for the VHS version of the Anthology was enough, think again.  The amazing clarity and detail of both the video and audio on this DVD set makes it well worth the investment.  Buy it, watch it, listen to it on a good home audio system, and I'm sure you will agree.",1050105600,3,4214,4.39741935483871

802313,5,630416923X,"first, let me explain what significance the Beatles hold for myself and perhaps the millions of fans over the world. the beatles are quite simply the most important contribution to humanity . their efforts in the field of music are incalcuable. they arrived at a pivitol time in America. they helped us to forget the problems of that time. John F. Kennedy had only been assisignated three short months before their legendary appearance on Ed Sullivan. the country was facing the beginnings of Vietnam, racial injustice and a generation that were becoming fed up with the standards which had been laid down by their elders. it was a dreary time and the Beatles that February night with more than 70 million people watching their television sets proved that music (if only for ten brief minutes)held the potential to change the world. My entire basis of musical understanding is based on the words and music of this great band.
i watched the anthology series back in November of 1995 with great anticipation. i knew that for many years this project had been in the works and that there had to have been far more material not aired over the course of that week. the purpose of the series accoring to George Harrison was to add closure for all Beatles fans but i look at this as an opening for the casual Beatles fan to come and explore what made these songs so memorable. Hours had been shaved off this series to fit within the parameters of network tv. i waited for that day to arrive when they would be released on dvd. my prayers have been answered.
when you think of the great Beatles machine, their grandeur and mystique you tend not to think of the band as individual but this amazing foursome who wrote some of the greatest songs of the 20th century and perhaps rival the works of classic composers like Bach, Beethoven and Gershwin. this program is a unique and rare glimpse into the individuals minds. how they saw it and lived it. you begin to see them for their endearing qualities which only helps build your exisiting admiration for them. you'll be amazed at some of the footage you see such as their taxi ride from JFK airport to the hotel they were staying at. truely remarkable. this documentary is unparalleled and unprecendented and truely is the chronological tell all of the greatest band ever as told through their experiences and experiences of trusted aquaintances of the band. well I'm working on disc two athe moment and have another 7 1/2 hours to go not including the 90 minutes of extra footage (beyond the extra footage worked into the original documentary). long live John, Paul George and Ringo!

802316,4,630416923X,"I've been eagerly awaiting this DVD release for quite a few years now, and sadly I must report that this collection is rather disappointing.  I look through all these glowing reviews and feel as if I've gotten the wrong edition but alas that isn't the case.  The full length documentary is here in fantastic digital quality yet why did they make the contents of the set so thin?  DVD special editions and releases of classic films are usually filled to brim with extras yet this isn't the case.  The extra disc contains mainly footage dealing with the putting together of the Anthology and the recording of ""Free As A Bird"" and ""Real Love"".  The video for ""Real Love"" is included yet some how not the same is done for ""Free As A Bird"" yet puzzling enough it does include a short bit about the making of latter's video.  Why one but not the other?  With all of the footage cramed into the documentary in edited form, would it been too much to put some extra clips on each disc?  Instead we get two episoded per disc with each disc tracking in at about two and a half hours each.  That's a lot of wasted space on each disc and it just calls attention to how thin this set is of features.  Just check out ""A Hard Days Night"" to se a Beatle's set done right.
One big problem I encountered is the wildly fluctuating sound levels.  If you remaster the sound but don't normalize them, well then you've only done half of the job.  Watch the Anthology with your remote in your hand because you'll be turn the sound levels up and down faily regularly.
Another disappointment is the lack of any materials in the jewel cases listing tracks, and why aren't songs given chaptermarks now that I think of it.  Argh, it really gets under my skin that this DVD set has fallen short of the mark.  Look at how well the CDs from this series came out and then the book as and maybe you'll understand my point.

802410,5,630416923X,"Initially I selected the Real Love video from the main menu on the special features disc, and I realized, as the video was playing, that there was no sound coming from my DVD player. I pressed the AUDIO button on the remote and noticed that the DVD player was on DTS mode (that's strange, I didn't select any audio mode previously, and my DVD player is set to play in the Dolby 5.1 mode by default). By pressing a second time the AUDIO button, I changed the setting to Dolby 5.1, and the problem was fixed. I guess this won't happen to those who have the appropiate audio equipment to enjoy DTS sound.
Now my comments about the anthology itself:
I got this DVD boxset (in its region 0, or region-free encoding release) just yesterday, and played only bits from all five discs to sample this material. When the documentary aired for the first time on ABC in late 1995, I was not able to watch all the programs; I remember watching the part when the Beatles were about to break up as a band, and when John, Paul, George and Ringo were playing on the roof. I enjoyed very much the versions of the songs that the Beatles played on that last part of the series, particularly Let It Be and the Long and Winding Road. The VHS videos of The Beatles Anthology were released here in Mexico in 1996 or 1997, but I didn't buy them then because I already had a DVD player and was amazed by the quality of audio and video that the DVD format is capable of deliver, so I decided to wait for the DVD release. From what I've seen so far now, I think it was worth waiting for this boxset, although I was hoping to see the ""hawaiian"" girls dancing at the end of the Hello Goodbye Number, instead of other material that the producers of the anthology decided to insert.",1049500800,3,1749,4.303030303030303
802411,5,630416923X,"Derek Taylor, the Beatles' press officer, has devoted his life in that job to maintaining and revivifying the Beatles myth.  I don't mean that he tells lies about them, or that there's some sordid ""truth"" about the Beatles that he seeks to conceal (Albert Goldman, back to your seat!).  I mean that he, more than most other people, has helped to shape the posthumous legend of the Beatles as being some kind of uber-human cultural force - what they themselves referred to as being ""Fab"".  His liner notes to these DVDs are in that spirit - you'd think there were almost no other bands during the 60s from the way Taylor writes about this one.  Still and all, he also observes (righteously) that the Beatles were the greatest romance of the 20th century.
It's true.  They were, with all the complicated glories implied by that intriguing word ""romance"".  Maybe it's the quality of the music, maybe it's the power of the legend, but I always come away from encountering the Beatles feeling like I've just ended a wonderful, intense, electrifying but all-too-brief love affair.  They can make you sad and happy at the same time.  I'm happy that I've heard the songs, sad that there aren't more of them (and that a few of the existing ones aren't even better than they are), regretful that I was born after they split up and never got to see them, glad that they never stayed together and ended up getting old ... (OK, I don't much like ""Free as a Bird"", but I notice it's actually been covered by those monsters of rock terror King Crimson, another fave of mine, so there's another point on their card)...I could go on.  Either way, the Beatles have an incredible capacity for making me feel more alive, that no other band has ever come near.  They were the first band I ever liked and they'll always be my favourite.
The ""Anthology"" series' greatest virtue is also its greatest flaw - that it's told almost entirely by the band itself (Lennon appearing in archive footage or voice-over.)  We never get to hear from the women, for example, because Yoko Ono didn't want to take part - imagine what Cynthia Lennon might have contributed! ...Of the fans, almost the only contribution is some old B&W footage of a hapless Cavern denizen named Cathy, who you can see fearing that her beloved lads are being taken away from her - ""I just want it to be like it was before,"" she wails, but it was too late even then.
I watched this on British TV when it was first broadcast and it's not quite as great now as it seemed then.  There seems to be an awful lot of not very interesting footage of the band performing ""All My Loving"" (never my favourite Beatle song) on some forgotten TV show or other.  But it's balanced by a blistering live performance at the Washington Coliseum, in which the band truly wigs out, plus a generous selection of stuff from the great Shea Stadium film.  (Why isn't it on video?  I remember seeing it telly in the early 70s...)  There's a lovely shot from that show of Brian Epstein, standing near the stage, calmly chewing gum, observing the teenage insanity around him and nodding to himself in quiet satisfaction - yeah, this is pretty much how popular I thought they would be.
As the series goes on, you start to wish that the inevitable won't happen, but of course it does.  They get swamped with acid and produce the gloriously poised ""Sgt Pepper"", but from then on it's increasingly tragic; no Beatle of 1964 would let something as dull as ""Rocky Raccoon"" or ""Bungalow Bill"" onto a proper album.  They'd have saved it for the fan club discs.  And for every three moments of glory in their later work, there are things like the dreary ""Blue Jay Way"" or the mean-minded ""Piggies"" to be taken into consideration.  The Beatles at their best were so great, that at their worst it's  heartbreaking how ordinary they could be.  Watching scenes from ""Let It Be"" in which they bicker about guitar parts (Paul pompous, George sullen, John uninterested) is like overhearing your parents having a row in the next room.  Fortunately they got it together for ""Abbey Road"";  but the second side of that album is notably less inspired than the first.  Ringo always kept this band in perfect time, and when they broke up, it was with an immaculate sense of rhythm.  (There used to be a joke that Ringo not only wasn't the best drummer in the world, he wasn't even the best drummer in the Beatles.  But the joke betrays a tin ear. Ringo was in this band because the others knew talent when they heard it.)
The coda, in which all four Beatles get to deliver a verdict of sorts, is for me the most touching part of the whole series.  George is typically reflective, remarking on the spiritual and emotional cost of the whole thing to the Beatles themselves.  Paul is just glad it was all done with such a great spirit of love and understanding behind it.  (Granted, Paul, and there's no doubt that ""Hey Jude"" is as good as it gets; but please explain ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"".)  John, in what from its slightly defensive tone sounds like an interview from the very early 70s, says that they were just a rock band and breaking up isn't the end of the world - true, but this was no ordinary rock band.  However, in my book Ringo steals the moment, clearly moved as he recalls the deep, private, four-way connection that this band forged during the maddest and hugest career any band ever had.
They were the best.  This is a priceless haul of Beatle stuff, more than any but the most rabid fan could ever want.  But there were always generous like that.  Don't worry, lads, you passed the audition.",1049500800,,5598,4.547357926221336
802412,5,630416923X,"If you are a boomer, than you must consider yourself fortunate to have grown up at a time of exhilerating excitement and hope, epitomized by rock's greatest singer/songwriters.  With the DVD release of Anthology, along with MOJO's current special series, this is a wonderful time to reflect back on the joy and wonder, and especially the power of the music that stirred a generation.  I truely wish that others had followed in their footsteps that could bring similar bliss and enpowerment to subsequent generations, but I guess ""the dream is over"", or at least on long-term hold.
  The anthology itself is superbly constructed, much better than what was aired on ABC years ago.  Even at 10 hours there are large chunks missing (Stu's death, John's early marriage), but the important thing is that this document collects so much valuable audio and film/TV clips that not only remind just how much stuff the group produced in a decade, but also where it all came from.  This really is a class act.
  Onced upon a time is all we got to get us through the dark days, as we wait for new heroes to emerge to help us shake off the blue meanies once again.",1049500800,,1149,4.625615763546798
802413,5,630416923X,"Almost eight years have passed since ""The Beatles Anthology"" first premiered, heavily edited, on commercial television.

Having viewed the expanded footage, first in the VHS version released in the mid-1990s -- and now the DVD package I finished viewing during the past three days (in what were ten of the most enthralling and fastest-moving hours I've spent in front of the tube) -- it can now be stated, without reservation, that ""The Beatles Anthology"" is a marvel, even for contemporaries who may be wondering ""what the fuss was all about"" in this tale of four Liverpool lads who, despite their origins many years before 1964, ruled the USA radio airwaves for only seven years (1964 through 1970).

""Anthology"" renders it impossible for viewers to dismiss the group's accomplishments, their output of consistent musical masterpieces during the 1960s. I won't get into the guts of this, all covered fabulously by previous Amazon reviewers.

But I do want to add this about the 2003 version of ""Anthology."" The special new features on disk #5 alone are worth getting this package all over again. With George Harrison now gone, the poignant ""re-union and recollections"" of the surviving members in 1994 for this documentary are on fuller display in previously unseen footage, and hence feel more meaningful to the viewer. They hang out on the grass, they jabber about stuff at the table, they swear and laugh. They play goofy music together in a room; they join their long-time producer George Martin, listening to studio outtakes on old reel-to-reel tapes. They're clearly enjoying themselves. We don't see as much ""new"" as we'd like, but we see enough to provide a sense of ""closure,"" knowing that before the Beatles went their separate ways again after 1994, each surviving member had acknowledged their collective accomplishments with arguably greater love and respect than they did previously, especially in public.

While ""on-the-fence"" fans, journalists or historians -- might've wished for greater coverage about the more controversial aspects of the Beatles' reign, the fact is -- nothing major that is negative has been left out of ""Anthology"" that's glaring (or galling). Moreover, despite possessing final approval for this project, without the Beatles' participation, we might not have this, the final record of the their accomplishments, expressed from the perspective of middle-aged guys looking back, armed with wisdom.

The unprecedented access the surviving Beatles gave for this production enables us to hear their own words about what happened to them, rightly or wrongly -- their triumphs and tragedies, their successes and failures -- warts and all. Equally amazing is hearing John Lennon's voice throughout the documentary, so intelligent, witty and cynical all at once, providing great insight as to their motivations for success, how surprised they were when it came and how much it ruined them. Yet, as Harrison admits, success allowed the Beatles to re-invent themselves, to experiment, pushing them into new territories that enhanced and engraved the towering legacy they left behind.

So much has been written and recorded about the Beatles that it's gratifying to know, especially with respect to new information dealing with the bittersweet and heartbreaking efforts associated with the creation of the Fab Four's 1995 release, ""Free as a Bird"" (covered in greater detail in the 2003 version), that the ""Anthology's"" producers never had a problem with ""lacking "" material. If anything, given the ingenious cutting and editing, 10 hours on five disks still leaves you wanting more.

Production values are top-flight. No expense was spared, no corners cut. ""Anthology"" looks and feels like a zillion dollars. The re-mastered DTS audio tracks are magnificent, and the ability to access subtitles enables viewers to pick up even ""PG-13"" mutterings with greater clarity, stuff cut out of the commercial television version. Yeah, the Beatles, especially George and Ringo, let loose with swear words here and there, though not gratuitously, displaying unguarded emotions about what they loved and hated about being members of the world's most successful pop band.

So after watching ""Anthology"" is it still fair, in 2003, to say the Beatles were indeed ""the greatest?""  Were they the greatest even if you mildly admired them, and weren't a rabid fan?

In my view, the answer is yes.  ""Anthology's"" pictures, interviews and songs support the theory that starbursts of genius are mostly seen in people who are young.  By the time the Beatles broke up in 1970, each member had just hit or was approaching 30.  They went out bitterly, but they also went out on top.

By 1980, the year of John Lennon's murder, they seemed no longer embarrassed by their association with a worldwide pop culture phenomenon.  And it's quite exhilarating to hear the surviving members, especially Lennon (seen in archival, post-break-up footage), acknowledge somewhat modestly, despite myriad superstar musicians who have since followed, that in fact, as a team, they ""did OK.""  As one of 'em says, ""Yeah, I thought we did alright. We were a pretty good band.""

Flash forward to 2003. Hearing their words, combined with stellar concert footage, interviews, rehearsal sessions filled with gaffes, news coverage of their exploits, the creation of their theatrical films, their growing maturity with lyrics and melodies -- solidifies what ""objective"" historians must now agree -- that the Beatles' place in history as one of the greatest artistic/creative collaborations of the ages is forever preserved.

More than 40 years after the group's struggling days in Liverpool and Hamburg, it's indeed safer to declare, once again, that the Beatles and their spectacular accomplishments -- will be endlessly studied -- even centuries from now.  And this has gotta be beyond comforting for fans.",1049500800,11,5887,5.270299145299146

Other than some archival soundbytes, there is no narration in this mini-series. The story is told by the Beatles themselves (as well as appearances by George Martin and others). Some time after being televised, it was released on VHS but at the time I found it quite expensive, and also I must have known that DVD was on the horizon. So I decided not to buy it on tapes. And I promptly forgot about it. Then in March 2003, I was searching on the internet for something totally unrelated when I stumbled upon the news that The Beatles Anthology was to be released on DVD about two weeks from the time I discovered the news. Fantastic I thought. I bought it only a couple of days after it came out and am very happy with it. The first time it was shown on television it was heavily edited into 3 x 2 hour episodes (approx). So it was terrific to see all the stuff we missed out on the first time around. The bonus disc has interesting tidbits, showing the boys recalling those incredible times in their past, having a bit of a jam session, and putting together ""Free As A Bird"" and ""Real Love"", the Beatles tracks of the '90s. This is the sort of mini-series that all Beatles fans and those interested in music history in general must have in their collection.

I just wish this box set was around in video form twenty three years ago when most young people still knew who the Beatles were and John Lennon was still alive. I believe it would have been the biggest video seller in history back then, generated so much new interest, and just maybe that could have prompted a Beatles reunion??

The picture quality of the original set is about equal to the VHS, maybe just a bit better. But, the audio is easily superior. ""In My Life"" and the other songs that I've heard so far, sound better than even the CD's. The bonus disc is great. I wasn't disappointed at all. I didn't detect any of the ""cold shoulder"" between George and Paul, as I'd read in earlier reviews. On several of the chapters, the picture quality is stunning, couldn't be better. According to some of the dialogue, parts of the bonus disc were apparently filmed in '99 and maybe even after November, 2001, when George died. I suppose they must have used high resolution cameras, due to the advent of DVD's. My favorite segment of the jam is ""Blue Moon of Kentucky."" They do it ""Elvis style"" and it's great. The chapter layouts are done very nicely. The only improvement that comes to mind would be if they'd ""isolated"" all the songs from the entire set, so they could be readily accessed.

802489,5,630416923X,"The Beatles Anthology originally aired on ABC in November, 1995.  The documentary was shown over the course of three days with the big hook being seeing the videos for the two ""new"" Beatles songs ""Free As A Bird"" & ""Real Love"".  The series also set the stage for the release of three double-disk Anthology albums that would follow in subsequent months.  The documentary itself is a true gift for any Beatlemaniac.  It is loaded to the gills with performance footage, behind the scenes looks at their recording process, home movies and old interviews.  The best part though is all the living Beatles, at the time, participated in the production and gave current interviews and John Lennon was also liberally featured through archival interviews.  Seeing Paul McCartney, George Harrison & Ringo Starr discuss their experiences in the band is a real treat and it's what separates this documentary from the countless others about the group out there.  Also, their producer and guide, George Martin provides candid insights that only someone who was so closely linked to the band could provide.  The new DVD collection does a tremendous job in providing a sharp picture and the 5.1 surround sound is amazing.

For those who own the VHS, the DVD is worth picking up because of the special features listed above. Plus, they have everything in 5 discs as opposed to the bulky 8 tape VHS set. For those who only watched the 3 part TV Anthology series, remember that this set has an additional 3-4 hours of material not seen on television.
If anything get this set so you can hear the songs all over again in amazing 5.1 DTS surround sound. If you don't have a home theater system, it's time to get one for this great DVD set. Don't wait to read other reviews to pick up this DVD set. This is a no-brainer. Get it on April 1. As the bombs fell over England in 1940, John Winston Lennon was born and as war raged, Sir James Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey a.k.a. Ringo Starr began their young lives in a dirty port city called Liverpool. They were mostly poor boys who today are legends.
The most interesting thing from the TV special in 1995, the 3 albums that followed and the 8 VHS tapes that expanded the story was the fact that it was ""The Beatles"" in their own words and recollections.
There's so much packed inside this story and safe to say, so much more we don't know, that it is engrossing each time you watch it. The interweaving of outtakes, never before heard songs and footage is beautiful. George Martin's emotional talk and tears as he remembers John Lennon is heartwrenching. You see here the strength of the four lads from Liverpool, the closeness of their friendship and those involved with them.
The DVD version is jammed with more than the 8 VHS tapes and elevates the ""Anthology"" to a rounder story. At the time of its initial release, there were 3 surviving Beatles, sadly now there are 2. One sit through of this is not enough for you are sure to miss elements. As timeless as The Beatles themselves, so is their story and this anthology.

The picture could have been remastered a bit better however, the quality is grainy and not as sharp as I'd hoped. The sound quality is done fairly well, but I found it most irritating that whenever the program cuts to song, the volume literally doubles! Either you hear the spoken dialog in whispers, and hear the music at a comfortable level, or else you hear the spoken dialog, while having your eardrums blasted with intercuts of song! We love their music, don't get me wrong, but turn the freaking volume down guys!
I also feel that the Anthology in general spends FAR too much time focussing on the Beatles' earliest days. Most Beatles fans would have rather had more attention spent on the Beatles' latter years and material, when their artistic merit was at its peak. The scratchy, raw, early tracks should have been treated as ""bonus material"", not the main course in my opinion. As it is, two of the five disks in the set, [the first two], I'll most likely not watch very much.
What would have been nice is an extra CD of every Beatles ""video"" (they called them ""promo-clips"" in those days), in their entirety, uninterrupted. This would have included such ""videos"" as ""Lady Madonna"", ""Strawberry Fields"", ""Penny Lane"", Paperback Writer"", ""Rain"", ""Hey Bulldog"", ""Revolution"", and more...I think, as Beatles fans, we're all pretty sick of watching these legendary Beatles ""videos"" as badly digitized, low-res, downloaded MPGs - right fellow fans?

And I love this anthology - especially with the extra 80 minute disc addition! What could be better? The other positive reviews before mine explain most of the reasons why you should own this set, so there's no reason for me to re-iterate what they have said so elequently.
So why four stars instead of five?
Well, let's put it this way: whoever remastered this for DVD messed with perfection - that is, they remixed much of the music pretty poorly. No, not the sound quality, but by subtly changing the original mixes. For example (hopefully, this makes sense), when the group is lip-syncing to ""Hello Goodbye"" on Ed Sullivan's show, Paul's ""oooh"" heard toward the end (over George's infamous one note spear sound he gets from his guitar) has been re-edited to be sung every time George plays that note. ""I Am The Walrus"" has John's vocals mixed noticeably out front with the Shakespearian recitation buried and virtually unheard at the end. ""Paperback Writer"" lost most of its reverb, and on ""Revolution,"" the mixer who did the mixing mixed in the original recording with their live performance - compare Paul's opening scream to the VHS version to hear what I mean. Same with ""Hey Jude.""
Call me picky, but I'm a traditionalist. Give me the original, the way it was meant to be heard. Personally, I feel they did this as kind of their own little 'watermark' to possibly prevent anyone from copying anything. If this is the case (I have no proof that it is, but it makes sense), then it's ridiculous. We are true Beatle fans who deserve The Real Thing.
Now, that said, I still give it a four star rating because, except for the above silliness, it's still a remarkable and must own set for Beatle and music fans in general. Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, it is not at all boring. This is a yearly watch for me and my family and we learn something new at each viewing.

802595,5,630416923X,"(4/1/03) Whatever you may have thought of The Beatles Anthology documentary in its earlier incarnations (broadcast, VHS, Laser), the most compelling reason to purchase this DVD release lies in the last of the five discs: ""Special Features.""
Those already familiar with the Anthology as a film will, as I did, look to this disc first. The new material, already mentioned in other reviews, succeeds in completing the documentary project as an addendum; the material provides interesting insights into the production of the Anthology film, as well as the CD's and the two ""new"" videos/songs ""Free as A Bird"" and ""Real Love.""
The bonus materials also give us (perhaps unintentionally) a more lively insight into the interpersonal dynamics of the remaining Beatles in the late 1990's (the kind of realism so called ""Reality TV"" vainly contrives). Shot during what was no doubt an arduous, yet therapeutic re-examination of their past, the group reminiscences (edited from material filmed either for the production or the later marketing of the Anthology) are fascinating. Those well versed in Beatles and post-Beatles rumor and lore will no doubt have much to examine (or ""read into"") when watching Messrs McCartney, Harrison, and Starr cheerfully and sometimes tiredly reminisce in both song and in story. (Contrary to some rumors, there are really no new song performances here - all are informal and incomplete dalliances.) Detail oriented Beatle-ologists will no doubt examine and re-examine everything said and sung during these group sessions, as well as everything unsaid and unsung. ""Regular"" Beatle fans will enjoy the often funny anecdotes and the music, no matter how ""impromptu"" or unpolished.
As a package, the DVD is faithful to the original Anthology release in artwork and packaging, taking its cues from Klaus Voorman's poster wall concept, with an animated version of the collage serving as theme to the menu navigation on the discs. The sound has been re-mastered for DTS, Dolby 5.1 and PCM Stereo, which is arguably great for the music, but bears little impact on the interviews.
As an owner of the older VHS set, my only minor unpleasant surprise in viewing the new DVD's was the odd choice of fonts for the titles and subtitles. In re-mastering the film for DVD, the producers stripped away all the original ""Copperplate Gothic"" establishing titles to clear way for the DVD's digital subtitles. While understandable (it arguably shows that the film was consciously re-mastered for disc) the digital ""sans serif"" titles lack the film style that gave the original documentary visual sophistication. Again, a minor point.
Those looking to update their ownership of the Anthology would do well do consider this latest technology release. The DVD replaces aging tapes and the Special Features complete and rejuvenate the film.",1049155200,5,2838,5.23956043956044
802596,5,630416923X,"Of course, having just purchased these DVD's a few hours ago and spending every minute with them since, I am very impressed at the surround sound (and the video). I am no expert on surround (but would say on hi-fi stereo in general) by any stretch of the imagination, but hearing some of these tunes in DTS surround is a revelation. Apparently, by viewing the end of the credits, the whole series has been re-mixed for 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital. It certainly begs the question of all Beatle albums being released in DVD-A or SACD. We'll all be buying Beatles albums in some new format well into our retirement, I suppose. The new extras are great to see, especially the production team interviews, and what I really was looking for in this purchase since I already have the VHS version. Of course, the convenience of not having to fast forward and rewind the tape  is wonderful, also. Another point: when the VHS version was purchased, we all didn't have our television video hooked up with component video cables and digital audio cables. That makes a great difference. Great picture, great sound. Plus extras. Great deal. Now, when is Let It Be being re-released on DVD.",1049155200,,1176,4.681159420289855

Sobre todo ver juntos a George Ringo y Paul en 1994 y 1995, como buenos amigos, cantando y recordando sus mejores tiempos con John, es en extremo emocionante.

802598,5,630416923X,"Some of the most revealing footage in this fantastic collection appears in Volume 8. Never before had I realized the extent to which Paul's surge of creativity in 68 and 69 put John ill at ease. Two monster hits (""Hey Jude"" and ""Let it Be""), are performed -- and just watch John as he plays on these tracks. Except for the last 3rd of ""Hey Jude"" it's obvious that John feels like he has nothing to do on these songs -- he's like a backup musician and he's just buzzing with hidden jealousy because Paul has the spotlight. And boy does Paul have the spotlight -- half of these songs are just Paul in close-up singing directly to the camera, while John strums his guitar offscreen (""The Long and Winding Road"" is an even more extreme example). And then -- bam! -- John is in bed with Yoko campaigning for world peace or posing naked on the ""Two Virgins""  cover and so on and so forth. It's like he's trying to grab the attention back which Paul has stolen. Now, I personally think John was doing better work than Paul right up to  the end (i.e. ""Across the Universe,"" and ""Don't Let Me Down""). But as anyone who has followed the Beatles knows, John was as obsessed as anybody with who had the Number One hit, who had the ""A"" side of the single, and so on. Watching Volume 8 I could really see John just smoldering with resentment. It's a glimpse into a very human and not very noble side of someone who remains one of my great heroes. It was fascinating.",1049155200,,1452,4.315018315018315
802599,5,630416923X,"As the bombs fell over England in 1940, John Winston Lennon was born and as war raged, Sir James Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey a.k.a. Ringo Starr began their young lives in a dirty port city called Liverpool. They were mostly poor boys who today are legends.
The most interesting thing from the TV special in 1995, the 3 albums that followed and the 8 VHS tapes that expanded the story was the fact that it was ""The Beatles"" in their own words and recollections.
There's so much packed inside this story and safe to say, so much more we don't know, that it is engrossing each time you watch it. The interweaving of outtakes, never before heard songs and footage is beautiful. George Martin's emotional talk and tears as he remembers John Lennon is heartwrenching. You see here the strength of the four lads from Liverpool, the closeness of their friendship and those involved with them.
The DVD version is jammed with more than the 8 VHS tapes and elevates the ""Anthology"" to a rounder story. At the time of its initial release, there were 3 surviving Beatles, sadly now there are 2. One sit through of this is not enough for you are sure to miss elements. As timeless as The Beatles themselves, so is their story and this anthology.

802600,5,630416923X,"As expansive in scope as any of the PBS documentaries that have come down the pike, Anthology wasn't just an attempt to tell The Beatles' story--it was an attempt to combine the band's story and two turbulent decades of change in the world. Anthology gives us The Beatles' story in microscopic detail. It also manages to provide a context for the band's music and why it touched (either in a positive or negative sense) a chord with the world.
Change is never easy and society occasionally elects gurus to help with that burden. The Beatles were pushed into that role sometimes willingly but just as often not. As a long time fan of the band, I found Anthology engrossing and fun to watch. When I purchased the videotapes I found I didn't return to them very often. This kind of surprised me but I discovered that I didn't have much desire to watch them twice much less three or four times. Perhaps it's the media overkill society we live in. More than likely, it's simply the fact that I appreciate the history but the music means much more to me. What I occasionally will do is dip my foot in one part or another of the Anthology, swim for a couple of laps and then I return to the music refreshed.
The inclusion of footage of the ""Threatles"" (as critics referred to them as a result of the Free As A Bird and Real Love sessions)jamming makes this collection much more essential than the previous version. It's a chance to see Paul, George and Ringo perform together for the first time since the break up of the band. A note of caution, however, is that these are exactly that--jamming with two yukes and percussion courtesy of Ringo's hands & pants. They aren't finished songs nor were they ever. It's still kind of cool is hear Paul occasionally perform with his acoustic (or electric) on a given tune to illustrate a point.
Given Harrison's recent death, there's a sense of closure now that this footage has been released. These are just three guys playing songs they love because they want to not because they're trying to recapture the past. Likewise, the video footage on the making of Free As A Bird and Real Love. Both songs neither hurt nor hinder the Beatles legacy but give long time fans what they've been clamoring for all these years--a reunion of sorts where John, Paul, George and Ringo ""perform"" together.
The inclusion of the footage from the recording sessions for Real Love and Free are also quite interesting. It provides a glimpse into the altered dynamic of the band. Without Lennon, they weren't quite The Beatles even with his ghostly voice haunting the studio monitors. In many respects, Paul, George and Ringo were paying tribute to a fallen comrad. All of that perspective was lost due to the media saturation and expectations when Anthology came out. Each member of the band had carved out a life and career and still managed to come to terms with a rewarding but difficult past. The bitterness of the divorce was more of a distant memory and the surviving trio was just trying to recapture that feeling of fun they had before they became an industry.
Jeff Lynne faced much criticism at the time for his production of the two ""new"" Beatles songs. In fact, his sympathetic production ushers the material into the 90's without losing the very qualities that made the band's music so special. While the songs themselves aren't the best Lennon ever wrote (in fact Lennon, McCartney and Harrison wrote much better material during their often uneven solo careers), it's not the quality of the song that matters: what matters is the feeling brought to the performance of the tunes. It's not groundbreaking nor was it meant to be and it shows The Beatles as they really were--a really good band that made it very very big (to paraphrase John).The insights into the making of the Free video are particularly interesting. Director Joe Pykta discusses the origin of the concept, various additions, subtractions made to the video. It's a loving valentine to the band with witty references to oodles of Beatles songs.
The impact of the band on popular music is put into perspective by Ringo when he commented that there were lots of big acts and very few monster acts (to paraphrase him). They were the monsters of rock music at a time when there was a lot of popularity for a lot of bands. It all came down to their level of success and their cultural impact as a result.
The sound quality is terrific and although the remix to 5.1 will continue to generate debate amongst Beatles fans. Tampering with the past is touchy business much less a fan's memory of ""how it was"". Luckily, The Beatles themselves recognized that they were some mythical Holy Grail nor are they some sort of ancient artifact. The remix breathes new life into the older material allowing a new generation to appreciate how groundbreaking much of what the band accomplished really was.
While there's a lot of essential material here, the Anthology really could have been edited down to a two or even three disc set. There is considerable repetition. That was necessarily, no doubt, because each member had not only their own recollections to share but their own agenda about the past as well.
Nevertheless, the wealth of material is worthwhile having for hardcore Beatles fans and rock historians. Is it essential? Well that all depends on how important the era was to you and whether you feel the need to relive it again. As I said sometimes a short dip in the pool of memory refreshes both the soul and makes us appreciate the importance of what is past.
The DVD is less awkward than the videos and more user friendly than both the laserdisc & videotape formats. The importance of the Anthology for fans goes beyond the music or any need to recapture the past. It's comfort video for the soul. Anthology manages to digest an important era in history with a fair perspective. The Beatles themselves recognized they weren't the pied-pipers of the era. They were just for guys making music they thought was important and trying to live down a reputation that was hoisted upon them by the media and a adoring world. Anthology is like an old coat you keep around because it's smells and touch bring life to distant memories.
Now for the nasty stuff--criticism. The picture verges from fair to excellent. The earlier interviews of Paul, George & Ringo look like they were shot without either adequate lighting or on early digital video. The quality doesn't hold up to some of the other footage. The inclusion of the band's promotional videos and performances are great--but it would have been nice to have an option to play them without commentary or as supplements on the 5th disc. No doubt, Capitol plans on re-releasing the Red and Blue albums on DVD with the assorted collection of promo videos included (and there were quite a few).
Anthology is a link to the past not buried by the past. Enjoy Beatles fans, at least some of the band's music has jumped into the DVD age.",1047772800,7,6962,4.688725490196078
802601,5,630416923X,"This is the pinnacle of all DVD releases! Of all the fantastic movies and various live performances which have been remastered to DVD, this is the ultimate! The Beatles revolutionized our pop culture unlike any other influence, and to have their story told on VHS tape didn't do it justice. There is not one bad song in their catalog, and bands are still trying to make ""Revolver"" and ""Sgt. Peppers"" to this day with no avail. I am really excited that they have finally released this monumental collection on DVD. The Beatles can do no wrong. Everything they release shoots straight to number one, and it's been 33 years since the four of them were last in studio together. Look for this collection to sell as hot if not hotter than the original VHS and subsequent CD releases in 1995-1996. Just look at their ""One"" album from 2 years ago. It's just a recompiled collection of their #1 chart toppers and it knocked 'NSync off the charts when it was released! The Beatles broke up 10 years before most 'NSync fans were even born. That's a testamant to the power of their music, and the scope of their influence. ""Anthology"" is recomended to ANY music fan, and if you are a Beatle fan I don't think you could be any happier.
A great addition to ""Anthology"" is the bonus disc, which contains a very relaxed informal interview with Paul, George, and Ringo in 1995.  Also, they take you back to Abbey Road studios one more time in 1995 to discuss how they made ""Golden Slumbers"", ""I'm Only Sleeping"", and their most phillisophical song ""Tomorrow Never Knows"".  For all you musicians and producers, this is really fantastic.  They break down the tracks so you hear each overdub and brilliant idea before the master edit.

The Beatles also along with snipets of John Lennon answering questions that went along with The other three's memory of their history gave me a better insight of the group through their own words. I appeciated that they did it that way to silence the critics and to set the record straight about the rumors surronding the group. I also enjoyed The first video in many years of ""Free as a bird"" with John Lennon's original demo combinded with the mellow sounds of Paul and George Singing Background Like the old days in the 60's. I have to tell you .It made me cry to wonder what could have been if Lennon was alive and would the frenzy still continue after all these years.

interview footage of the two surviving Beatles, as well as taped and film interviews with John

performances of many of their greatest hits, and obscure and un-released songs, which provide
further insight into their creative brilliance as singers, songwriters, and musicians

You will find film performances of many of their greatest songs, which were the precursors to
modern day music videos, a style of musical promotion invented by The Beatles, to promote
their music in the post touring days of the group. But throughout, you will find the wit, humor,
excitement, and creativity that made The Beatles a world-wide musical and social phenomenon.

Anthology was excellent!  This was a documentary that was told by all four Beatles in a mature and intelligent manner without their wacky sense of humor in it.

The flow of the entire documentary is much better on the video version than the truncated episodes shown on television.  In this respect, ""Anthology"" succeeds where the Ken Burns PBS epics fail.  Unlike ""Jazz"", where the music is merely a backdrop for the director to comment on the issue of race in America, the focus is squarely on the subject at hand.  Through the story of the Beatles, one gets a good sense of the times -- popular music, politics, the music business, media.
The editing is a bit overdone at times and some segments go on a little long to set a mood or to allow a rare track or film clip to play through, but these are fairly minor quibbles.  Fans will rejoice in actually seeing or hearing the material; the uninitiated will be amazed at some of the footage and gain a new, fuller understanding of why the group was a worldwide hit.  The Beatles performances in Washington, DC and on Swedish television, for example, delight with the sheer raw energy the group shows; the wit and candor displayed in the interviews and other assorted appearances are refreshing.  The members of the group come off as interesting, complex individuals -- not exactly the type of thing you would have expected to see in a television documentary.
Many hardcore fans may be upset with the exclusion of some subjects from the documentary -- the 'butcher' cover, etc. -- but any project of this type, by necessity, has to eliminate something.  The fundamental question dealt with in the piece deals with how the group developed and evolved.  And this epic video answers the question quite well.",984182400,4,1731,4.765886287625418

For those who just ""like"" the Beatles-it may be too much of a good thing-but for those of us who reached puberty and beyond with the Beatles as our mystical, magical gurus-it's still not enough! The more recent interviews are sparse and Ringo comes across as much more intelligent than the stereotype of him that prevailed during the glory days-an intelligent man without an education.  Nothing shocking-but the skeletons aren't hidden either-as all the Beatles are quite candid.  It would have been nice if Pete Best had been included-at least in the portions that pertained to him--All in all-great entertainment and a nice walk down memory lane.  Although this set is out of print on VHS-it is still available on laser disc if you search--although a laser disc player may be harder to find!

802911,5,630416923X,"This superb, masterfully crafted collection is a MUST HAVE for any serious Beatles fan.  It is a nonpareil collection that will never fail to delight  the viewer/listener.  This is such a real treat to have!  It is a treasure  trove of memories and music.
The montage of the Beatles at the start of  TAPE 1 is brilliantly crafted.  It is a visual treat to be savored along  with the music.  The collection opens with some rare Cavern Club footage  and the delightful, rocking ""Some Other Guy.""  My favorite part  was when Ringo joined the group in 1962.
I was quite impressed with the  way the Stones' shoddy version of the  Beatles' ""I Wanna Be Your  Man"" was juxtaposed on TAPE 2.  This was very effective in calling the  stylistic differences to listeners; the Stones' version is harsh, not fine  toned and an ersatz imitation of a song that Ringo made great.  I loved the  Royal Command performance the Beatles gave for the Queen of  England in  November of 1963.  John has immortalized that concert by telling the folks  in ""the cheap seats"" to just clap their hands and the rest to  ""rattle your jewelry.""  John had a WICKED sense of humor and a  gift for the satirical.  I LOVE IT! John was a natural wit with a flair for  natural expression.
Seeing the TV footage of the Beatles during their  pre-American tour years was an added bonus.
TAPE 3 was one of my  favorites.  1964 has long been rightfully heralded as ""The Year of the  Beatles"" and I could never tire of seeing the Beatles' first  transatlantic arrival to America on a Pan Am flight on February 7, 1964. We  are treated to the Beatles' individual wit during their press conference;  we are treated to the now famous Ed Sullivan TV appearances on February 9  and 16, 1964.
One's heart goes out to Ringo who missed part of their  Australian tour in 1964 due to tonsillitis.  I was glad to see the film  footage of Ringo rejoining his ""mates"" after he was granted a  clean bill of health.
TAPES 4 and 5 chronicle 1965 - 1966.  TAPE 4 gives  a good overview of the filming of ""Help!"", the Beatles' second  movie and Paul tells his story.  The Beatles receive their MBE awards from  the Queen in 1965 and TAPE 5 picks up from there with the 1965 Shea Stadium  concert, the 1966 Japanese concert and the deplorable way the Beatles were  treated in the Phillippines.  George gives an interview about how he and  John met.  My favorite parts on TAPE 5 was the inclusion of the 1965 album,  ""Rubber Soul,"" and the 1966 ""Revolver.""
TAPES 6 and 7  show the psychedelic era.  On the 6th tape, friction is evident in George's  account of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" being Paul's idea.  There is a  bittersweetness to this tape; it includes the Beatles' last concert in San  Francisco in 1966 and the beginning of a new phase -- the pyschedelic  phase.  This is pointed up in TAPE 7 when the Beatles get involved in the  Marhareshi's Transcendental Meditation program and Eastern influence is  heard throughout many of their songs.  Yoko is also included in this tape.  She is a vital element to the group during this period because of John's  strong love for her.  It is this love John has for Yoko that makes the  scenes with her poignant and touching.  I am glad she was included.
TAPE  8 is one of closure.  It shows the famous rooftop performance, the drug  busts of George and John and the end of the Apple record company.  It is a  bittersweet tape, the end of ""The Long and  Winding Road.""
This  is such a worthwhile collection to have.  All we can do now is keep hoping  for another Beatles' collection like this to become available.",967852800,9,3593,4.503912363067292
802912,4,630416923X,"As a serious Beatles fan and trivia maven, I am certainly the last to put down the efforts of the three remaining Beatles to tell their story in  their own words. I thought this was an excellent series, and certainly  worth watching--great soundtrack, cast, plot ;) That said, there are  certain problems inherent in making a documentary of this nature...
But  first, the good points.
This series has an enormous advantage over  similar Beatles videos & books in that it is done entirely from the POV  of the Beatles and their 'crew.' There is no speculation as to motives,  events, feelings, or any aspect of their career as a band. This is probably  as close to the truth as we will ever get. In addition, this is a  comprehensive overview, from the beginning (early history of each member,  John meeting Paul) to the breakup, with all the tours, albums, and fights  in between. Each surviving member has the chance to give his own  perspective on each event, with the intent of clearing up rumors and  biographers' embellishments.
This is where the grey area begins.
The  one very obvious absentee of this series is John. For reasons that are  pretty much self-explanatory (he's dead), he could not be included in the  video by any means other than old video clips. The trouble is that during  the Beatle days, none of them were allowed (or thought it at all wise) to  reveal their true feelings about the group. And later on, they were all so  bitter about the breakup that we have to take comments from the 70s-80s  with many, many grains of salt. For this reason, John's voice and real  feelings are notably absent from this video--a tragic omission.
Another  issue is that there are some 'delicate' events that the ""other  three"" may not wish to fully discuss. These include Paul's breakup  with Jane Asher, the Maharishi, drug use, and (of course) the group's  eventual falling apart. I sincerely doubt that Paul, George, or Ringo would  deliberately lie to us, but I suspect that PR agents (or the guys  themselves) may have decided to eliminate certain elements from the  documentary, to work around them, or to omit certain details.
Above all,  what should be remembered is that this documentary is done from the Beatles  point of view. Each individual member has a different outlook on each  event, and the real facts may be colored by emotion and passage of time.
But despite these problems, which will affect almost any retrospective  documentary, the Anthology is a wonderful look at the Beatles. I would  strongly recommend it to any fan of the group, and to anyone with an  interest in 60s music and culture.",965779200,17,2625,4.747228381374723
802913,5,630416923X,"I hated the though of spending this kind of money on some video tapes, but  after I did, I had no regrets. This is an excellent series that traces the  history of the Beatles from their pre-Beatle days to their breakup. It's  narrated by the surviving members of the bad with some clever integration  of older interviews with John Lennon.
It's also a complete recording of  their greatest hits as well. Each of their big hits is played in full with  excellent video and film images. I still get goosebumps when I think of the  images of the Beatles walking across Shea stadium in front of thousands of  screaming fans.
The series doesn't dull or lose focus. The effort to put  it together must have been mind-boggling. No stone was left unturned. A  must-have set for anyone the least bit interested in the Beatles.",962236800,,815,4.597222222222222
802914,4,630416923X,"The Beatles: Anthology_ suffers from an at times unsatisfying duality.  At once anthology and documentary, there are moments when the producers' need to include obscure video footage of the Beatles performing slows the narrative considerably.
In particular, the producers' enthusiasm for  showing lengthy excerpts of a concert--just to get across the point that  the boys weren't playing well--is frustrating.  Also, there are times where  the narrative given by interviews is actually incredibly sparse to make  room for performances that really don't merit the time.  In short,  _Anthology_ is like the subject it takes on: brilliant but at times  unabashedly self-indulgent.  The result is a vision for the project  sufficiently vague to prevent the editor from making clearer  choices.
Still, the work is completely absorbing.  It's impossible to see  it playing in a room and not want to sit down and watch it.  The story the  interviewees weave leaves you energized and melancholy simultaneously.  It's thrilling to see how great they were together and yet you can see the  tensions emerge and ultimately consume them.

Tape 1 begins with a  video collage of their history, features their youthful beginnings, days in  Hamburg, how Ringo joined the band, and their rise to the top in  England.
Tape 2 shows their growth as a band, talks on their BBC  sessions, performing for the Queen, stories about touring, and some  hilarious TV segments!
Tape 3 begins with their introduction into  America, talks about their performance on the Ed Sullivan Show, Ringo's  tonsilitis, and their 1st movie A Hard Day's Night.
Tape 4 talks about  the pressures of touring, drugs, Dylan, the making of Help!, the  inspiration for Yesterday, and winning the MBE award.
Tape 5 talks about  their Shea Stadium performance, meeting Elvis, Rubber Soul and  Revolver.
Tape 6 talks on the events that led to the Beatles' final tour  in 1966 (the Philippines and John's remarks about Jesus), Strawberry Fields  Forever, Penny Lane,Sgt. Pepper, and their holiday in Greece.
Tape 7  starts with the One World performance of ""All You Need Is Love"",  and talks about the Maharishi, the death of Brian Epstein, Magical Mystery  Tour, the opening of Apple, Yellow Submarine, and John's new companion,  Yoko Ono.
Tape 8 begins with the White Album, discusses the closing and  dissolution of Apple, Hey Jude, Let It Be, Paul's marriage to Linda, John's  marriage to Yoko, George and John's drug busts, Abbey Road, and the Free As  a Bird video (what?  Real Love isn't included! ).

I mean where are all the details of the Sgt. Pepper album? How  about their last recording session (without John)? And why isn't Real Love  some where in there?
One more thing, 26 years after they split, they  practically bring John Lennon back to life and record 2 new songs, and not  a word about that.....What were they thinking? I would have liked it if the  last part of tape 8 would have been about their reunion. Isn't that part of  The Beatles Anthology?

7863509,4,630416923X,"This is a wonderful collection of information about a band in the '60s that in my opinion started the musical British invasion of America.  There are interviews with Paul, George and Ringo, Neil Aspinall, George Martin, footage of the band playing live, and many other excellent bits.  That's why I gave it four stars.  The reason why I didn't give it five stars is below.

Yoko Ono.

The ending parts of this DVD set brought to mind the image of a bunch of people at a family gathering, all determined to not say anything about that huge turd in the living room that smells to high heaven and can't be gotten around.  When I saw the credits, saying that both the Estate of John Lennon (which of course is owned by Ono) as well as other Lennon materials were furnished by Ono, then that fully explained the rushed ending about how the Beatles broke up - because it was obvious to me that, if the makers of this Anthology wanted to have those materials pertaining to John Lennon, they definitely had to avoid in any way offending that creature.  I have read a great deal about the Beatles, and what is painfully felt but missing in this series of DVDs, for the reasons I just mentioned, is just how much Yoko no-talent Ono was hated by not only members of the group but also by people who worked with the group.  I used to marvel that someone like John Lennon, who seemed intelligent, could fall for such a loser like Ono, until I read extensively about his upbringing.  His mother Julia sounds like a dippy man-obssessed fool, who dumped her little boy John in her ever widening pursuit of hedonistic pleasure, usually involving men.  John was raised in part by his Aunt Mimi, who was the polar opposite of Julia, in that she was strict and actually thought that hard work and good grades and a good job were important things to attain in life.  So the schizophrenic way in which he was brought up would produce exactly what he became: a person torn by two intensely dominating figures in his life.  Then his mother Julia died in a horrific car crash, and he was left with Aunt Mimi.  She dominated John, and while he hated it, she was the only mother figure left.  To my mind, this psychologically explains in great detail why John would be attracted to such a grasping, talentless loser as Ono.  John's first wife Cynthia picked up on this in her book, saying that John needed a domineering figure to replace his Aunt Mimi, and Ono was it.  Look at the way John called Ono ""Mother"".  Who calls his partner Mother?  Someone who wanted one, that's who.  Then there's the 1980 Playboy Interview, another example of John calling Ono Mother.  And speaking of that interview, why on earth was Ono there in the first place?  The interview was with John Lennon, not her.  So why was she even present?  Obviously because Ono had him so psychologically brainwashed by that point that John believed she had to be in on EVERYTHING.  What an evil, grasping, self-centered talentless person she is.  And I call her talentless for a very good reason.  One of her ""conceptual art"" pieces was a ladder that you got up on and when you got to the top you found the word Yes.  Yeah, took a lot of talent to design that piece of crap.  Or handing people a business card with one word printed on it: Breathe.  Uh-HUH.  And the way she treated her step-son Julian was absolutely appalling and definitely showed her obsessive and nasty character.  I completely agree with Julian's acidic comment that Ono is very manipulative and ""she knew exactly what she was doing.""

So, the DVD set is fascinating and well done, if you can manage to see through the reason as to why the ending parts are both rushed and are obviously leaving A LOT left unsaid.",1520553600,2,3725,4.513432835820896
