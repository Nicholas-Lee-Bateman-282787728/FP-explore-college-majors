8014075,5,B0001LQL74,Great. Nothing can be said bad about anything about Harry Blackstone Jr.,1463270400,,72,5.083333333333333
8014076,5,B0001LQL74,This is a wonderful collection of illusions from one of magic's greatest performers. I was lucky enough to meet Harry and this collection is a great edition to my magic library.,1390694400,,177,4.741935483870968
8014077,3,B0001LQL74,"I loved watching Blackstone perform. And couldn't wait to see this DVD. What a disapointment ... the video is a compilation of several performances and all of them looked like they were shot by the auditorium for record keeping purposes. This is not a proffesionally shot video. Most of the video is in soft focus, many illusions/tricks are repeated and it diminishes the great Blackstones performances. It is worth wathcing only because there are no other videos on the market.",1325635200,2,478,4.9875
8014078,4,B0001LQL74,"Various clips from Blackstone shows over the years.  Lots of Holiday show footage.  Be aware a lot is from the 70's and 80's.  The footage is great, but at 70's and 80's picture qualety.  Dont expect high def qualety.  This is more vintage collectors qualety footage.  Great for anyone studying magic as it has some of Blackstones classic routines",1261699200,,347,4.796610169491525
8014079,5,B0001LQL74,"Such greate stuff, even if the footage is a bit grainy.  Shot on big stages, with big pit orchestras playing live music (how I miss those days), this is classic Blackstone,Jr....",1199664000,2,178,4.741935483870968
8014080,5,B0001LQL74,"So far I only saw two chapter of the dvd at the moment and they are great. I will see some more when I get around to it, and I like to see more dvds like this. and the title is Blackstone magical moment, but it is a great dvd.",1195603200,,226,3.54
8014081,1,B0001LQL74,"While Mr Blackstone is certainly a very fine magician, I cannot say the same for this very poor quality DVD. Clearly made via bad transfers from video tape,it's so soft and fuzzy sometimes it's hard to know what's happening on

stage. For the price I expected better.",1175644800,4,267,4.680851063829787
8014082,5,B0001LQL74,This DVD is a must for anyone that ever got to see the master at work.  I was lucky enough to be on stage with Blackstone a few years before his death and the showmanship is second to none.  The floating light bulb illusion is worth the purchase alone. Order and enjoy!!,1126137600,5,270,4.173076923076923
8014083,5,B0001LQL74,"I have watched the dvd at least 10 times, and I still can't catch him..try using the advance button on dvd, still can't see where that bird went..The light bulb illusion is fantastic..",1092096000,6,184,4.606060606060606
