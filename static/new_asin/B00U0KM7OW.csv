8703683,5,B00U0KM7OW,"A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG is the majestic work of a master filmmaker who no longer had anything to prove, and instead produced a relaxed, comic ode to desire and longing and alienation. Released the same year that Tati's PLAYTIME hit theaters, A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG has something of Tati's style, though Chaplin's humor shines through in the way he builds up character interaction.

This Blu has a beautiful, rich image. Absolutely worth owning.",1505952000,,449,4.986666666666666
8703684,5,B00U0KM7OW,"I loved this movie so much when I watched it on YouTube that I just had to order a copy on Blu-Ray, even though that meant getting an import from Italy (fortunately, region-free).  Sophia Loren is simply one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen, and she does not disappoint here.  I liked this movie even better than Arabesque, which is one of my favorites.  She delivers quite a moving performance as a stowaway aboard a cruise ship, trying to avoid being caught and trying to convince Marlon Brando to help her out.  A word of advice for Brando, who was ""stuck"" with her - count your blessings, dude!",1459209600,,625,4.504424778761062
