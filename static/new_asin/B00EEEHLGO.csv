5910524,1,B00EEEHLGO,"A group of young adults head off to an isolated home on an island with no electricity on Halloween. They happen to have a wiccan (Courtney Foxworthy) and a Ouija board. The opening of the film attempts to convince us there is a real Ouija board demon named ZoZo and this is based on a real story.

The filming is done by a hand held camera with bad camera angles and jerky motions. They have stopped pretending anyone is doing any filming. It is not found footage, it just looks that way. Tess (Kelly McLaren) is the main character and has trouble delivering lines. In spite of the lights not working, distinct shadows from camera lighting is visible. The horror aspect was also sad. This is a rank amateur film that lacks entertainment value. Appears to be a film designed to scare kids from goofing around with a Ouija board.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.

ZoZo update: ZoZo is the nickname of an ancient Akkadian ruler who became a demon when he destroyed the temples of El. He is currently trapped inside my Siamese Cat. If you encounter a ZoZo while playing Ouija, it is either ""the other guy"" moving the piece or a ZoZo demon impersonator.",1386892800,3,1227,4.538461538461538
5910525,3,B00EEEHLGO,"I was disappointing that I didn't get more of the main characters whole story. I felt I only got a glipse of an experience only mildly related to anything paranormal. It came across as the ravings of a guilt-stricken young woman. If that was the intent, then awesome. Despite that, I didn't feel that it was painful to watch or overly cheesy. I would like to see more like this just a bit more story and better acting.",1386720000,3,418,4.371794871794871

There were times I had to fast forward the movie because not only did it have horrible highly annoying music but it spends a great deal of time - BORING time - watching them fix fish, and eat. To top it off the music will drive you crazy because it sounds so bad. I  truly lost my money  - take my advice - don't get this movie.

5910527,1,B00EEEHLGO,because this director knows nothing of the paranormal this movie sucked ass. an ending with a bitch crying trying to get an inhaler come on where were the elements of a haunting. I am a paranormal researcher all hauntings even from a spirite board cause evp seeing shadows hearing voices clear as day scratching noises and demonic possession does not take 3 seconds to happen don't waste your money as I did world of advice to the director get some special effects in with shadows doors closing voices and other haunting relayed stuff. messy tessy crying like a baby come on the college people who made paranormal activity put real effort into a camera movie and it was amazing and realistic the oujia board then the huge black mass and demonic possession do your selves a favor do not buy this movie I could make a movie better then this,1384905600,2,838,4.593333333333334
5910528,4,B00EEEHLGO,"A friend recommended this movie to me despite knowing I am not a Horror fan. What I have learned from watching I am Zozo is this is not so much a strict horror movie as it is a psychological thriller. The film opens with Tess, our protagonist, already institutionalized  having been driven crazy because of her interaction with the Ouija Board and a demon named Zozo. The story is inspired by true events involving Zozo, who preys on those weak and foolish enough to play his game.

I am Zozo is better suited for people weary of the overused tricks of mainstream Hollywood films. Maybe not for everyone, the pace is a slow burn analogous to a foreign film. The audience knows where the story will conclude because weve seen Tess in her unbalanced state. What happens in the next 80 minutes is a tense reenactment of what transpired the weekend Tess and her friends encountered Zozo.

This is not a slasher film in which the monster shows up to eviscerate the teenagers after theyve had sex or gone on a bender. No moral lessons rest here couched in shock and awe. This movie exists in duality. Is Tess unstable because Zozo has affected her, or is she susceptible to the idea of Zozo because of a preexisting condition? Near the end of the movie Tess is shown as a child covering herself up with a blanket as we watch an ominous shadow stand over her. The audience must consider whether or not Zozo has infiltrated even her earliest memories to pervade every aspect of her psyche, or if this is an indication of an earlier torment, which makes her more vulnerable to suggestion of demonic attack.

The director, Scott Di Lalla, has an accomplished cinematic eye stemming from years of documentary work. He is able to capture just the right image that will evoke the appropriate tone. His use of 8mm film gives the movie a gritty texture and visceral quality. The shots are all beautiful and evocative.

Zozo stayed with me because of the opposition underlying the narrative. The movie could be a tragic tale of misfortune befalling irresponsible young adults after a night of moonshine, or a straightforward demonic attack. The truth is for the viewer to decide. We believe what we want to believe.",1383436800,4,2199,4.657216494845361
5910529,1,B00EEEHLGO,"This is easily the worst film I have seen all year. It is painstakingly boring with no suspense and absolutely no payoff of any kind. For the uninitiated, ZoZo is a supposed deity that has frequently been encountered during spirit board sessions around the world over the centuries. Those who communicate with ZoZo are said to experience terrible events or even demonic possession following their encounters. I AM ZOZO attempts to fictionalize one such case, in only the most mundane ways imaginable. We are first introduced to a group of unlikeable teens led by the idiotic Mel, who refuses to stop playing with the stupid Ouija board even after she repeatedly encounters hostile spirits. The acting is atrocious, and the editing for the Super 8 film stock is even worse, with dialog overlapping cuts and leading to questionable jumps in continuity. ZoZo's powers of possession amount to briefly holding one of the characters down on the bed, and causing Mel to use her inhaler. Then it's over. Although Tess is shown to have become possessed by the demon in the very beginning of the film, we are never shown how this truly takes effect. Writer/Director Scott Di Lalla only demonstrates his complete lack of talent as a filmmaker from start to finish. I AM ZOZO is a pathetic excuse for a film, I regret wasting my time seeing it through to completion, and I apologize to anyone who wasted their time reading this review. Look elsewhere.",1383350400,15,1439,4.853658536585366

5910544,1,B00EEEHLGO,"Remember that one episode of Parks and Rec where April had submitted her idea for a mural? You know, the one with the human hamster wheel with a guy eating raw beef and a big screen tv with the looped video of knee surgeries. And rats made of garbage. This is that. In fact, I think April's idea was better because at least you could look at it and go, hmmm well that clearly is just insane and weird without having to read a title, description, waste an hour and a half just to realize that it makes no sense and has nothing at all to do with what you were lead to believe. This movie is absolutely directionless. A better description would have been; A psychological thriller that will leave you asking why! This 91 minute film that's look to have been recorded as a web quality smartphone video will leave you more scared of having to re watch scene by scene horrible acting and aimless videography mixed with what was probably someone's abandoned MySpace music playlist. As a group of friends go to their friends Dads weekend getaway home, you tag along to yet more aimless cuts and pans of cut off faces and scenery, more bad acting, dialogue that seems more fitting of a group of elementary friends than young adults. Lots of empty plot ties, the film seems to continue to drift among attempts to try and fix these. It's kind of like that argument you have and then after it's over you think of all the best things to say, except these comebacks get crammed into every nook and cranny to try and make up for it. Then, magically, a ouijia board appears from one a friends girlfriend. Whaaaaaaat?! A ouijia board?! I know, I can feel the danger lurking, too! They never pan a full view of the board as it is being used but somehow they manage to get a few words to sentences with just a few back and forth swipes. It's obvious they didn't even want to attempt it because in on instance all they do is swipe and suddenly an entity calls the girlfriend a f***ing b***h. Rude, right? Yeah, don't blame it. When I spell, I just aimlessly swipe my fingers across the keyboard (computer and smartphone) and magically words appear from this without any direction. Finally, Zozo makes its first contact. Oh no! Danger is lurking people! No, no, not really. Then you enter into another 45 minutes or so of just complete randomness. For a movie said to be about a well known entity legend, this has like only .05% to do with it. It focuses mostly on the group of friends through bumps and thumps that give you the chills through the night. Which still makes no sense because even then the friends plot story doesn't have any real direction. So there you go, forced into this perspective of cut off faces and point of views as things get scary for about 30 seconds then end and never return. Zozo never makes contact or attacks again but somehow he's managed to scar this group and kill someone. I won't lie to you, spoiler alert! Trust me though, you'll thank me you knew someone died at random instead of melting your brain through this movie like I did. I am Zozo is more better titled I Am Zozo: My 30 second encounter. Overall, the plot was a let down. The description is kind of spot on but only because they do make contact with a ouijia board but that is it. They don't actually ENCOUNTER and there isn't more to ask. For example, they contact it AND THEN THEY ALL GET FOLLOWED AND DIE HORRIBLY DEATHS WITH ZOZO ETCHED INTO THEIR SKIN! No, they just make contact (more like an attention seeking name dropping friend) and that's about it. So if scatterbrained grainy smartphone quality films with nothing exciting and more question riddled 'thrillers' are your thing, this is for you. If not, well, welcome to the club and you're welcome for saving you a few bucks.",1435968000,3,3765,4.457971014492753

5910551,2,B00EEEHLGO,"Well, to lay the foundation, this is a no-budget, c-movie, weekend-shoot ""supernatural horror"" video. Having said that, there are some great ones, and some epically bad ones (far more of the latter than the former). This one isn't as atrocious as the one-star reviews would have you think; however, it's definitely no higher than two-stars. The acting is predictably at the level of what you'd expect from a group of friends with no acting talent just getting together to make a movie. But, perhaps more accurately, it's more what I'd consider a final exam project for students in a Filmmaking 101 drama course at your local community college.

All that said, there are no scares, no thrills, and - again - the acting is, with one exception, definitely abysmal. The only exception is the actress who played the redhead lead, Tess. I think she may have some talent, and might even have a future in acting. The rest need to go back to their day jobs.

On a positive note, the music was actually interesting...

...except for perhaps the worst song I have ever heard, which you will unfortunately encounter at 1:30:00 mark (near the end of the film) which may permanently scar your hearing (and your brain) as you listen to what must have been the screams of a rabid, drunk badger being run through a blender and set to marching music and a kazoo.

There were some laughably bad scenes and oversights, like when the kids pour and drink ""100% grain alcohol"" into tumbler-like glasses and drink it like it's water. I don't know if you've ever had Everclear or grain alcohol, but the director seemed to forget that it doesn't get served like water, in half-full tumbler glasses. If you can drink even one shot, you're lucky - thse kids pound it like the Kool Aid the pourer describes it NOT being like. The director seems to think that alcohol (even jack daniels) isn't water, which made me wonder if he was a Mormon or something and didn't know anything about booze.

All in all, it's just another c-movie to throw on the crap pile of disposable, homemade ""horror.""",1421625600,3,2060,4.679558011049724

5910559,2,B00EEEHLGO,"So, the film makers here are going for the typical ""how do you sell a low budget flick"" deal by going down the Blair Witch Project and trying to pass this thing off as being based on a true life event. Already it lost one star right there from me, because hey, don't BS a BSter, right? Everyone knows as far as this claim to being a true story goes, it means someone actually did write this story down and it exists as a story, therefor it's a true story... however, does it have elements of truth in the story to real life events? No, not at all.

So the plot goes... sigh... Zo Zo is a ghost or spirit or something that contacts people through ougi and then... well, makes them cry, play the trumpet and live in a mental hospital because he is always with them.... what else you might ask? I dunno, they movie never went into it and that's all the said... except the terrible ending of the film... i'll mention that in a minute....

so, these kids go for a weekend at a lake house... on an island, and they seem to be the only occupants. Oh yeah, it's Halloween, and one of the kids is a wiccan... which they tried to make a big deal, but Wiccan's are just nature lovers really, they aren't witches and posses no oogedy boogedy voodoo mumbo jumbo what-so-ever. Yet, this witch thinks she can use the board to communicate with the dead. The kids manage to contact a few spirits, then find Zo Zo who also pretends to be the Wiccans dead cousin, and then there is a bang on the wall, some pointless dialog, a bunch of kids drunk as a skunk on something more potent than moonshine, and then a horrible ending to the film that ruined it as it was just about to start getting good.

It's that typical ending where they seem to have either given up on filming more, had writers block, or just ran out of money and time to film the rest, as it just quits and reveals a stupid as hell ending that, quite like the Blair Witch Project, had me sitting there with an eye brow raised thinking, ""Is that it, seriously. They ended it like that?""... had I paid for this, I would demand my money back.

It really had potential to be something. The characters where OK, except the Wiccan girl... her happy go lucky attitude and making instant ""BBF's 4 Life"" the moment she meets someone was just lame as. But the story it had going wasn't too bad, it looked like it could really go somewhere. But then the ending. What a horrible way to slap the viewer in the face and say game over, no insert coin, do not pass go, do not collect your refund. I hate when movies do this. The only time I can remember when it was accepted was the ending of ""Monty Python and the Holey Grail"", however, that was a comedy, so you can get the joke that it just ends cause they ran out of money... but this movie is not a comedy... and it stinks to high heaven that they ended it the way it did and had no real ending.

2 stars down for bad ending and claiming it was something that really happened... yeah right, check the websites date of creation on anything that mentions Zo-Zo in a ougi world. Nothing past the last how many years? Guess they didn't think people would check into those facts. But finally why it loses another star... the ougi board itself. Again, this movie claims they work. They are party fun, and even the psychology of the thing is explained in this movie! I was willing to go with it and suspend belief that they managed to make it finally do what it was supposed to in this film... but because of the ending, I will use it against them and say... if ougi boards really did exist, wouldn't Milt and Bradly who distribute these things, you know, the same guys who make Monopoly and just about every other board game... wouldn't they put warning on the thing to be careful about trying to communicate with the dead? Don't you think studies have been done to prove if ougi boards work or not? You really think something like that would be sold by a board game making company if it could lead to harm? Seriously... think about it.

Then ok, if you still want to beleive a ougi board works, and you want to accept that the events of this film really happened... then the end title of the movie should have read ""All the survivors sued the living &^%$ out of M&B, or Parker Brothers or whoever sells ougi boards for not putting a label on the box warning you to never communicate with Zo Zo""

5910562,1,B00EEEHLGO,"Granted, there aren't that many Ouija board genred movies out there, so the creators of this film pretty much had their pick of the patch as far as original ideas went.  Instead they opted for an 8mm fistful of nothing.  The fact that it was shot on fuzzy 8mm does absolutely nothing for the imagination.  At first, I thought this was going to be another found footage film and was proceeding to start cussing appropriately at having been tricked into seeing yet another version of that hackneyed trope.  Then I thought, waitaminute, this story is being told from the point of view of the Zozo demon.  No such luck.  Sadly, the truth of where this story was going quickly emerged:  5 perfectly generic and unremarkable college kids, whose idea of living on the edge is to bring a couple of bottles of beer and wine and their trusty Ouija board, score a weekend at an island cottage.  Hijinks do not ensue.  Granted the high point tension of the film is the actual Ouija session they hold (50 minutes in!).  Though dragged out a little too long, having the witch character interact with multiple spirit personalities added a promise of intrigue and suspense.  Then it goes nowhere.  Ab-so-lute-ly.  Nowhere.  Theres not much else to say.  Someone does die (it is, after all a horror movie), but its such a pathetic and avoidable death that you the viewer will need to be exceptionally credulous to believe that a spirit had anything to do with that death-to say nothing of the so-called real life events that this film came out of.",1392940800,2,1530,4.656716417910448

5910569,1,B00EEEHLGO,"This movie is basically a guide on how NOT to make a film. You have a script with laughably obvious exposition (""Well, as you know, it's Halloween. By the way, remember to thank your dad for letting us stay at his isolated island cabin for the weekend.""). The dialogue couldn't be anymore stilted if this was, I don't know, a documentary about stilts. The characters are completely unbelievable, whether they're weakly trying to tell creepy stories or -- more often -- just sitting around having the world's lamest Halloween party.

It's really hard to tell what's more at fault. Certainly the actors are bad. Absolutely awful, delivering painfully awkward performances like it's their first day at improv camp. But they're also asked to do some ridiculous things, the most common of which being forced frivolity. I couldn't count the number of times the film decided to show our characters having fun, but did it in a way that no one has ever had fun before. The worst example being two female characters, after a quietly dull conversation about dead family members, all of a sudden jumping up and laughing, running outside and literally grabbing each other by the hands and spinning and twirling around in circles before running off to gambol about in the woods. What, are they in fairy training? Who does this?

To pad itself out, the film also includes something like half a dozen musical montages of more boring stuff, including fish gutting, dinner eating, more forest frolicking, and I think maybe a boat ride. When they finally get the Ouija board out, this too is made as boring as possible. (And, honestly, watching people play with a Ouija board is already boring in and of itself.) There's no soundtrack, no atmosphere created, and they even include a parade of false spiritual starts and a completely contrived argument or two before Zozo finally shows up.

Not that Zozo ever really shows up.

Yes. The ""horror"" never really arrives, unless you count bad framing, poor lighting, absent cinematography, and shaky tracking as horror. There are a few things meant to make it SEEM like something scary is happening (a playing card goes missing, a girl has a rough night's sleep, there's more of that laughing), but there is no real payoff. Ultimately, this feels a LOT like a movie that someone decided to make up on the fly and without the benefit of any equipment other than a super 8 camera and a trial purchase of Quick Cut Pro. They even ditch half of the characters an hour into the movie for absolutely no reason other than -- my guess -- the writer didn't have the chops to fit them in without the story getting beyond his means to tell it. What story there is.

Independent film is a mixed bag, even more so lately with the tech and dissemination much easier to get and use. In the past, great auteurs without the financial means struggled to get their voices out there, but now almost anyone with the moxie can find a way to create something, be it film, music, or the like. It's an interesting age, in that this means there are more chances for genius to be discovered in unlikely places, but also that there is an even greater glut of horrible, horrible stuff out there to wade through in order to find the gems. This is especially true since it seems like everyone and his mother believes he has what it takes to make it big or, at the very least, entertain people. Thus I AM ZOZO, a film that fails to do anything right but still somehow managed to get made and watched by me.",1387152000,15,3500,4.62962962962963

It started out interestingly enough, but then lagged on for the next 45 minutes with absolutely NOTHING happening, until the end, which is shocking in its total lack of shock. I sat through till the end, hoping something would happen.  Alas, it was all for naught. Manos - The Hands of Fate had more shock value!",1530835200,,379,4.492753623188406

The over all sotry behind the film could have been good if it had just gone a bit further with it. Honestly, the way it was put together and some of the acting, ruined it.",1519862400,,259,4.098039215686274
