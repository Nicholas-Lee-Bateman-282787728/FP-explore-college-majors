4952016,3,B0064LMWCS,"I like a lot of Jean Arthur films, such as ""The Devil and Miss Jones"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" and others.  But this set came across as more of a collection of movies that were almost good but not quite. ""More Than A Secretary"" really overdoes the basic plot, which is she's out to get a husband but not in as ditzy of a way as her secretary students.  ""The Public Menace"" has her being kind of mean.  I didn't like her underhanded machinations in it and I didn't really care whether or not George Murphy ended up with her or not.  My opinion of the rest of this set is basically the same, they will do if nothing else is available, but they aren't the same quality as the Deanna Durbin movies or the Shirley Temple ones.",1369180800,,731,4.2

4952020,4,B0064LMWCS,"She rarely gets mentioned when it comes to listing the great film actresses of Hollywood's Golden Age, but Jean Arthur(born Gladys Greene in 1900)had something that Greta Garbo, Katherine Hepburn, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford lacked. She was more real and had a down to Earth quality about her that both men and women in the audience could relate to. And then there was ""The Voice"". It was kind of a raspy frog like voice that went higher the more excited she got. And she had perfect comic timing, something that is very difficult to do. Carole Lombard, one of her contemporaries, had it too. The movie going public in the Thirties and Forties could identify with such actresses because they were just like them. At least the characters they played were. Arthur worked hard to create her film persona. She made more than fifty silent pictures before Frank Capra made her a household name when he cast her opposite Gary Cooper(Arthur's favorite costar) in ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town""(1936). She and Capra made three films together(""Mr. Deeds"", ""You Can't Take It With You""(1938) and ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington""). It was this 1939 classic that they are both remembered for and viewing the film today you can clearly see that things haven't changed much in our nation's capital. Like Capra, George Stevens used her in a trio of films: ""The Talk of the Town""(1942), ""The More the Merrier""(1943) and Arthur's last film ""Shane""(1953) with Alan Ladd. She came out of retirement to do ""Shane"" as a favor to Stevens and it was a fitting farewell to a star who is mostly forgotten today. Her intense shyness, insecurity and aversion to studio publicity probably had something to do with that. Sony(which owns her Columbia films) has now released not one, but two Jean Arthur colections thru TCM titled the ""Jean Arthur Comedy Collection"" and the ""Jean Arthur Drama Collection"". She made about eighteen films for Columbia between 1934 and 1944 and each collection contains four films each, but none of the well known ones mentioned above. This review is for the ""Comedy Collection"" and the films are a mixed lot. ""THE PUBLIC MENACE""(1935) has Arthur playing a manicurist who tricks George Murphy into marrying her so she won't be deported back to Greece(the first part of the film takes place aboard ship). I won't give away anymore of the plot, but Arthur underplays her part in contrast to Murphy's overacting. He verbally and sometimes physically abuses her during the film which makes you pull for her all the more. The picture quality is fifty/fifty. Some of the scenes are crystal clear while others are grainy and sometimes out of focus. But it's an enjoyable film and has a happy ending. ""ADVENTURES IN MANHATTAN""(1936) has the first screen pairing of Joel McCrea and Arthur and their on screen chemistry is great. The film however is not what it seems and I won't give away the confusing plot. The picture quality is not very good either. Sony used an inferior print or maybe it was the only one available and the whole picture has grain running through it, but none of those annoying lines that run top to bottom thru the picture. ""MORE THAN A SECRETARY""(1936) is a delight and the highlight of this set. Arthur and George Brent are terrific but it's Dorothea Kent as the dim witted blond bombshell secretary that steals the picture. She's a hoot! And the picture quality is excellent too, very clear with no visable grain until fade outs and fade ins. ""THE IMPATIENT YEARS""(1944) is a wartime message picture that is curious now more than anything else. It takes to long to get to it's message but wartime audiences probably left the theater in tears after viewing it. Lee Bowman stars opposite Arthur and he's very good as her newlywed husband. This was also the last film that Arthur made for Columbia and she only made one more film before Stevens called her out of retirement for ""Shane"". Although these films are lesser known than her Capra and Stevens pictures, fans of Jean Arthur will certain enjoy them. The ""Jean Arthur Comedy Collection"" comes highly recommended.",1344384000,21,4076,4.815977175463623
