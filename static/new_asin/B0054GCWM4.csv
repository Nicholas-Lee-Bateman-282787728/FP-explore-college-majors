There's only one downside to this shoot. That its so unorganized, the director was shooting him questions that weren't in order. One minute Kens talking about his teens and how he was brought up. Then he skips to opinions on his pro wrestling career. Ken tells great stories. I wanted to know if Lou Thesz taught him any moves. Ken wrestled for Lou Thesz' promotion and wrestled his protege. He doesn't talk about it. Some stuff he was very vague about. Like that ""shootfight"" he had in UWFi he had this ""no comment"" attitude about it. I heard that, that's when they decided to make the PANCRASE promotion. Because they proved shootfight could sell. My favorite parts is where he shows respect for Bas Rutten, The Gracies, Dan Severn, and several others. I wish he would have talked about the early years of MMA in the US. When it only survived through VHS tapes. That's a byegone era now. But Ken really does shoot and holds no truth back.",1346630400,,1048,4.521052631578947
