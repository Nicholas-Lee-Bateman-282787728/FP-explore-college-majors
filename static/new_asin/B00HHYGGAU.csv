6165959,5,B00HHYGGAU,"The listed director and supporting cast, in Amazon and IMDB, are for another movie of the same name as the English title for this movie.
I am a native English speaker and so had to go with the subtitles which I found acceptable.  The direction, cinematography and acting were excellent. The movie shows life in a village sometime between 1966 and1976.  An act of voyeurism is a part of the narrative and lead to the movie being banned in China.  However, there was little nudity , and what there was of it was handled with tact.
I watched the film on Hulu plus and immediately logged on to Amazon and purchased the movie, a first  for me.  I would encourage anyone to give this film a try.",1402272000,15,689,4.393700787401575

With light subtitles against light background making it very difficult to see them at times, the story itself was simple to follow along with.  Not what I was expecting given the synopsis, but it was a very unique and, in its own right, beautiful film.  The story seems outdated in that it breaks down to a break in modesty and decorum, but the story is true to the nature of the time and people within which the film takes place.

The only reason I won't give it five stars is the overall film appears to be ended abruptly, and the characters - while they have an ending - don't seem to cleanly end.  (It's like watching ""Of Mice and Men"" and not seeing the end where Lenny is shot by George.)  We know what happens, but it wasn't part of the end.",1423872000,,851,4.2875

6166139,5,B00HHYGGAU,"Wow! This is a film that helps us westerners to understand how serious Asians take honor.  It may be beyond most viewers comprehension because we westerners don't share that same sense of honor.  Yes, the young boys discovery may have been innocent enough but, it's obvious from how he handled it that he knew he had something of value, so he was aware of the big issue HONOR, The boyfriend dumped her because he knew that he'd NEVER be an honored man having taken the hand of a dishonored woman.  The girl killed herself because she couldn't live with the scorn that followed being dishonored.  The young boy left town after his mother brought shame on their family dishonoring their name.  The old man gouged his eyes so that he didn't dishonor the girl again by looking at her dead naked body......Wow!  Honor is a huge issue in Asian cultures.  I knew a school teacher that was fired after giving a young Hmong  girl a congratulatory hug.  I saw another movie on Amazon where a young Asian girl killed herself after being raped.  This movie is about honor and the strong sense of shame and societal scorn that one must endure after being dishonored in an Asian culture.  This film is excellent, it really helps one to understand Asian cultures and how deeply they regard the issue of honor, and how cruel you can be treated when honor is lost.",1416268800,7,1347,4.570833333333334

While the subtitles were difficult to read in some places, nothing vital was missed. The subtle way the story is presented demands your attention - none of the buzz and glam to distract and annoy; it's not needed when the story is so good. Lastly - Slap him to death? How broken must you be, if you can't enjoy that? Open your mind - quite possibly learn something from the choice in translations.

The Culture Revolution influenced every people in China that time under the govern of Chairman Mao, from physical and mental. It's ridiculous and strange but it has deep historic reason that people there acted. A curious, naive boy caused a series of events, people acted sequentially the ideal moral background of communism, then at last a tragedy. The story is told delightedly, lightly when a bunch of children appeared, then seriously and heavily when one of the girl twins was peeped while bathing,  and at last sad and devastating when the girl died.",1411257600,,696,5.052173913043478

6166182,3,B00HHYGGAU,"This film started rather lighthearted but soon turned serious & ultimately rather sad. I is interesting that juvenile curiosity escalates to such tragic responses. It is extreme but considering the period in Chinese history & Chairman Mao's Marxist / Communist cultural revolution. Those warped ideals are translated into the morals of a rural village life. If you enjoy movies that are like mini cultural &/or historical  excursion, then this is a excellent movie to watch.

6166184,5,B00HHYGGAU,Wonderful film,1409961600,,14,6.5
6166185,3,B00HHYGGAU,"This is probably a more compelling film for someone fluent in Chinese and/or well-versed in the Chinese culture of the period.

A young boy is at the center of several troubles in the village, but most significant is his desire to see a film that the town bully has made a big deal out of. This leads him to a bargain with the local mortician, in which he reveals a hole in his bedroom wall through which can be seen the bathing area of the twin girls room next door.

They are caught, leading to much distress, all of it far overblown by today's standards, but likely well-within character for the time and place of the movie.

I sense that the story would have far greater emotional impact on someone who could follow it better. But unfortunately, the subtitles are poorly written, a problem exacerbated by the fact that they are presented as thin while text on an often-too-bright image. These issues are in turn compounded by Amazon's poor Instant Video transfer, which is relatively low resolution.

If the plot were presented in a less subtle manner (at a minimum, relying less on the viewer's own knowledge of the culture at work here), the subtitle problems might not have been such a barrier. But it's a carefully-but-sparsely written story. Not in a way that would normally be a problem, but for people like me who can't keep up with the actual dialogue, not having subtitles that work well makes it all that much harder to connect with the movie.

So, if you are fluent in Chinese there's a good chance you'd like this, and probably would give the film more than three of five stars. But for the rest of us, we may miss too much to really see the art and impact of the film.",1409961600,,1685,4.493464052287582

6166188,4,B00HHYGGAU,"The thing I like about Chinese movies is that they still look a the subtle psychological aspects of life.  They still ""hold the mirror to nature,"" as Shakespeare put it.  A Beautiful Mistake shows village life in China during the Cultural Revolution and how the values of that time affected how people reacted to an incident in which an old man peeped at a 17-year-old girl while she was bathing.  When it was found out, the town punished the old man by isolating him.  He later put out his own eyes (similar to the Oedipus story in Greek mythology), and the girl who was the target of the peeping felt such shame that she drowned herself.  The movie is a poignant demonstration of how much the values of a particular culture can effect how people react to moral situations.  The movie is not so well done, technically; others have pointed out that the subtitles often can't be seen because they are white on white.  However, this is a minor factor compared to the excellence of the story.",1408838400,7,989,4.553672316384181

A young boy looking to get money to see a movie, confides in an old friend, the village undertaker, that he will trade his secret finding for ticket money. The youngster had found a hole in the wall, under newspaper wall covering, that looks into the apartment next door, where two beautiful sisters live and into the area where they bathe. Soon, the old man is caught peeping through the tiny hole, an act that is taboo. Soon, what has happened spreads throughout the village and the series of events generated from this one act, ruins the lives of many people and causes the victim to end her life.",1407888000,11,749,4.769230769230769
6166232,2,B00HHYGGAU,"I decided to watch because it had been banned in China and I was curious as to why. I did not find it offensive or provocative, and there were only a few brief scenes of topless nudity. The officer of the rural town where this is set does take advantage of his position, so perhaps that is a reason. The story centers around three characters; a young boy, an old man, and one of the twin girls. The boy is a bit of an outcast trying to be accepted by the other boys in the village who are dominated by an older, bigger boy, who controls the group. The young boy looks for any way to buy his acceptance of the group, and gets in trouble for stealing. When he discovers a hole in his wall through which he can see the twins bathing, he uses this ""secret"" to get money from the local undertaker in exchange for a little peeping. They get caught and the undertaker is punished by the other villagers. The girl is publicly embarrassed and her bastard of a boyfriend dumps her. She becomes a bit unbalanced, unsure of her identity, and exposes herself to the undertaker before she drowns herself in the river, naked. The undertaker must collect her, and gouges his own eyes out before performing the sad task. In a separate incident, the younger boy has shown the older boy his mother having sex with the town officer. Pain all around. The older boy leaves town, a young girl is dead, and the old undertaker is now blind, all because of one young boy's actions. He seems to get some idea of the pain he has caused at the end, though he seems to escape adequate punishment.
The story itself is not bad, but it is a bit difficult to follow due to poor direction and editing, and pale subtitles. The cinematography was also in need.",1407715200,39,1723,4.337461300309598

8632932,5,B00HHYGGAU,"The undertaker's name is Wuyi and subtitles translate this as Grandfather. There is a familial relationship among the villagers and a hierarchy that is modeled by the group of young boys. There's a New Wave black and white quality to the imagery, recalling the sensibility of Kurosawa, Bergman or Satyajit Ray, unconventional in the film culture of the current decade. Faces and their expressions were instructive for me, the interesting symmetry of the features in the faces of people of China, Korea and Japan, features bred into the genome over thousands of years. One of the twins describes her boyfriend's expression as like an Abanian Papaya. He asks her, what's an Albanina Papaya? Chinese Papayas are smooth and if there was such a thing as an Albanian Papaya, she says, ""I imagined it as wrinkled."" If you reduce any narrative, no matter how great or otherwise, to an outline, as this reviewer has, your intention isn't to criticize the plot but ridiculing the plot isn't talking about those aspects of narrative that compels our attention and interest. My feeling about this film is that right now I'm interested in learning what it's like to be from China, to grow up there and then came here. This film piques my interest.",1487116800,,1234,4.880952380952381
