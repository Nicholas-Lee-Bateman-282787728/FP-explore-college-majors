Have you ever tried to read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica all at once, as in all the pages, right now, and attempted to make sense of all of it while drunk?  Did you figure out all the important characters and plotline?  Can you coherently describe what just happened?

Well, watching the first 6 to 9 episodes of this anime is a surprisingly similar experience and avoiding alcohol doesn't give you much of an edge with everything they are trying to throw at you.  (I know, because I started watching this while thoroughly sloshed and tried it again a couple of days later while completely sober.  It didn't help much.)  It is like the story and over-complicated world it appears in were compressed into a micro-blackhole and sent through time, sort of like Stein's Gate.  There looks to be a possible good story going on here, but so much data got slammed into the tiny bit that is the anime that the early part is a convoluted mess.  If an English translation of the Japanese light novel was available, I would probably grab it to see what all they tried to fit in there, because whatever it was, it almost certainly wasn't light.

The biggest problem this series suffers from is not knowing whether it wants to be a fanservice anime, a romantic anime, a weird historical re-enactment drama, a touching romance, a slapstick comedy, a strange stuck in a game-universe not a game universe anime, a Sci-fi or a Fantasy.  It has a huge cast of characters it wants you to know and meet, a quarter of which you question the necessity of, spend most of their time in the background, but are very definitely there.  There are characters for every type of fan base or strange taste or desire.  A random story of rescuing orphans manages to make room for itself along with some kid wanting to console another that is stressed because they are raising a ghost child for one reason or another.

Juggling all of that, while fitting in a vague plot, it manages to come up with some interesting and different ways of going about some of the fights and scenarios, such as the debate battles.  There is also the baseball strangeness.

The music is great, so is the animation, and the production looks to be beautifully done.  The last 4 episodes of the first season and the second season approach better pacing with better story, humor, and character development.  Despite the confusing beginning and the continued lack of focus, this anime does, in the end, become something worth a good watch.  If you are out of things to watch, looking for something different, or looking for something that is a bit of everything, I would say it is worth a try.",1521676800,,2755,4.631687242798354

8745460,5,B019KDXACC,I enjoyed first and second season of this anime is one of my favorites has a great story plot and it becomes better after watching more episodes of the anime and watching character development progress and has a lot of great action/plot the voice actors both cast English/Japanese did a great job voicing the characters. I enjoyed watching all the characters in this story especially the main protagonist. I hope they decide to make 3rd season want to watch the rest of this great anime series.,1473379200,2,494,4.755813953488372
