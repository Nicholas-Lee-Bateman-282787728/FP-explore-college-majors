I was interested throughout the entire movie and I really just enjoyed watching things unfold. The acting was stellar, everybody was really believable (I almost forgot Duchovny was Duchovny and I hated the mom's bf - as I was supposed to).",1347667200,4,390,4.666666666666667
5140618,4,B0088749H2,"What?  I saw this at Sundance, where everyone loved it, then I read a bunch of bad reviews on-line and thought there must be another film called ""Goats.""  I mean, the poster and the DVD cover are kind of cheesy, but the film is really strong.

I watched it again on PPV a few weeks ago and it was as good as I remembered.

Funny and not too boisterous or obvious, this film snuck up on me and the 1500 other people at Sundance, and turned out to be a real charmer.  Duchovny is kind of genius as Goat Man, both weird and believable.  I liked Justin Kirk a lot, too, and Ty Burrell's nervous restraint is fun to watch.",1347408000,18,617,4.1
5140619,4,B0088749H2,"""Goats"" tracks its main character Ellis Whitman (Graham Phillips), a 15-year-old Arizonan as he leaves the gorgeous desert compound his addled New Age mother Wendy (Vera Farmiga), has decamped to with her trust fund. Ellis has spent much of his early formative years taking treks and toking down with Goat Man, aka Javier, (David Duchovny) with whom he smokes copious amounts of grass and generally hangs out.

Ellis heads to an equally gorgeous New England prep school his own absent straitlaced rich father Frank (Ty Burrell) once attended. In fact, his dad had roomed there with the current headmaster, and so the bar is set high for Ellis. He smokes his courses (cut off from his cannabis connection), meets up with other potheads at the school, runs cross-country after some coercion from the hip track coach, declines a liaison with local dining-hall staffer Minnie (Dakota Johnson), who spends her time reading and making extra money off the student bodies. Ellis initially runs afoul of his father Frank during a terse, tense Thanksgiving, but later the pair find their peace and bond.

Ellis has to decide where to spend summer break, back in Arizona or with his dad, his step mother, and infant half brother.

Well, the critics pretty much gleefully savaged this Sundance film, citing its meandering plot, lack of action, and hybridized comedy-drama tone and comparing the actors and the plot to goats. Cynics are always ready with barbs, but I have to say, this is a fun movie when you don't want 3D special effects, overbearing soundtracks, mutilation and mayhem, and twisted plot lines. In other words, ""Goats"" affords one the chance to just kick back, watch a story without any secret message or theme. It's just a twisted tale, not a study in realism, about choices, growing up, and growing out. We have all done it in one way or another, and the point here is that there is always a story, even if  it is not a cautionary tale or sex romp.

It is not a classic movie, but it is a classic case of what happens when critics drip spleen and venom without considering maybe the point of the movie is to meander. I don't think the goats care one way or another but I enjoyed watching it on a Saturday evening.",1347235200,35,2220,4.72609819121447

These kinds of movies are hit and miss, but this one hits.

If you enjoy off-beat, non-traditional movies, this one is a winner.

The engaging ensemble cast each has his or her own set of challenges.

The protagonist is a boy who has been raised in a very weird environment with some unusual adults.  The boy is the only functional one, and he keeps the community going.  When he is selected to go away to a prestigious school, things begin to unravel at home.

The title comes from David D.'s character who is a goatherd and a bit of an amateur shaman.

It is a very fun movie with some great life lessons.",1434585600,3,653,4.295081967213115
5140642,1,B0088749H2,"This movie shows a young man coming of age without really saying anything new about the process. If you have not seen a coming of age film before this is one.

The major character is depicted as a relatively bright young man who lives with his mother. The mother is depicted as very self absorbed and hiding behind new age religion. She has a hired grounds keeper who is referred to as ""goat man"".He leads treks into the desert surviving off of goats milk for calories and liquid.  At first he is seen as ""cool"" but as the main character grows up a bit ...
goat man is realized to be a relatively broke adult running drugs.

The set of events causing this realization that the major character is sent by his estranged father to prep school. Its the same school his father attended.

During a break form school the major character is asked to visit his father and the fathers new pregnant wife. The boy stops off at a friends place where the friends alcohol spills on the major character's sweatshirt. The father smells alcohol on the boy and wants to be rid of the boy. The fathers wife...intercedes.

I guess part of the films point is the realization that characters are more complex than just good or bad. If your over 35 and already know this, then feel free to skip this film. Most of the older population actually know drug using friends that deem themselves too cool for a regular job, religious fanatics that hide behind their religion for all manner of behaviors, and adults that are very successful in the work place but run away from any difficulty in relationships. If you have seen all that already...this film won't tell you anything new.

Apparently reading the reviews...the younger crowd that has not covered this ground MANY times before....finds all this very entertaining.

Drug use is taken as desirable behavior though hypocritically moving drugs for sale is taken as wrong. I guess the writers don't connect with the fact that one may not occur without the other.  Casual sex is taken as no big deal. A male male sex act is shown. I think many young viewers give the movie a higher ratings because they see the casual sex and drug use in the movie as cool. That's not the values I wish our culture promoted.

I don't recommend the movie at all for teens because of the values about drug use, drinking and casual sex. I don't recommend the move for those over 35 because your time is better spent elsewhere. Perhaps there are a few sheltered collage students or older who may find something entertaining in this film. Even then, I think time is better spent else where,",1434153600,,2591,4.578833693304536

Pot seems to play an important role in this movie.  The characters are quirky enough, but that's not enough to recommend it.  The goars are fun, in a goat way, but don't see the movie on their account.  Maybe it would help if one saw it while stoned?

5140653,4,B0088749H2,"In this American indie film from 2012 we meet Ellis Graham Philips) who is fifteen and about to go to prep school; the same one his estranged father went to. He lives in Tucson with his hippy mother and a stoner, gardener/ handy man  Goatman- played by David Duchovny. They treck with goats, smoke locally grown weed and generally hang out; that is while his mum is off sorting out her chakra, making sure her ying and yang are in harmony and practicing primal screams.

He has to leave for school and is actually academically quite talented. The problems with prep school is no dope and worse still he has to re contact with his father  which will not go down at all well with hippy mom as she has a less than flattering pet name for her erstwhile hubby. He is soon finding his feet and friends at school but whilst missing Goatman he is also re- evaluating himself and those around him. This then is a coming of age comedy drama.

The term comedy has to be seen in the widest sense as it is more amusing in the making you smile department as opposed to laugh out loud funny. The acting is all quite good. Vera Farmiga (Source Code and The Departed) is surprisingly convincing as the hippy mom and brings a lot of energy to the role. The goats are great too. This is a gentle drama which if it catches you in the right mood can only warm the cockles of your heart.",1391644800,,1365,4.27906976744186

5140655,3,B0088749H2,"Goats is a quiet charmer, dramatic at times, quirky at others. Essentially a coming a age film following the plight of 15 year old Ellis (Graham Phillips) trying to find his place in this world.  Raised by his hipster Mom, and Goat Man (David Duchovny), he reconnects with his remarried and absent father.  The reunion is difficult at first, but rebounds later in the film, rather rapidly.  The film has a fair number of characters including Ellis' roommate and prep school buddies, and a mix of neighbors and his Mom's boyfriend (Justin Kirk of Weeds).  It's a ""420"" friendly flick, and this combined with actor Kirk, the movie often reminded me of an episode of Weeds, only slower and not quite as insane (or good).  It's a nice film for a chill moment, to just sit back and watch, presuming you like coming of age films with a bunch of crazy characters.  My favorite line is when the local town girl asks Ellis if Atticus Finch exist in the real world?

As the story of an adolescent coming into his own, it works very well and I loved the actor the actor the played the son (Graham Phillips, a then unknown to me), but honestly Duchovny's thoughts, musings, totally laid back character was meant to tell this story of a boy growing to manhood and the reality not to take things too seriously and go where your heart leads you.

Excellent movie.

They really captured the colors and appearance of the scenery without the usual harshness shown in most digital filming",1350345600,2,363,4.950819672131147
5140686,4,B0088749H2,"There is one thing I really disliked about this film and I'll say that and get it off my chest and move on to the good stuff.  I hated the really ignorant way that ""New Age"" people were depicted.  True, there are fools in any group but to characterize the many serious people who are attempting to find a higher spiritual way of life in the way this film does is offensive.  I turned the film off after about 45 minutes just because of this.

However I did turn it back on the next night and found that it managed to rise above the stereotypes it created in the beginning.  Not only were the New Agers ripped apart but the East Coast ""strait"" guy who went to Prep School was intially dismissed as an uptight jerk. The only sympathetic character was ""Goat Man"" the resident hippie, who somehow escaped being lumped in with the New Agers and, due to his massive consumption of home grown pot, was Mister Mellow.  Having spent considerable time in that area of the world with spiritual seekers and pot growers I think that there are some serious misconceptions about all of them.

However, moving on....I did like the lead character, Ellis Whitman, played by a wonderful young actor, Graham Phillips, enough to tune back in to see what happened to him after he left Arizona and went back east to attend the same Prep School that his hated dad had attended.  This is not very well explained since it's obvious that Ellis isn't at all fond of the man who apparently deserted him early on.  He has grown up with his mother, Wendy, (played beautifully by the wonderfully charming Vera Farmiga,)a ditzy, childish, self-centered but very rich woman and her landscaper/pool cleaner guy, Javier, aka Goat Man.  Goat Man is the surrogate father figure and has given Ellis a great deal of love as well as  dope.

The contrast between the two cultures gives a certain amount of humour and provides the grist for the mill of Ellis' maturation.  The film does a good job of showing how the fellow navigates between the worlds of both parents and that of Goat Man.  Ellis is surprisingly wise and resilient as he faces one challenge after another.  He learns, as we all have to, that no one is all good or all bad.  His flakey mom, in spite of her faults really does love him.  His straightlaced dad comes through, too.  And the hallowed Goat Man is shown to have his own shortcomings. This is done very well without being too obvious or preachy.

The cinematography is great.  The area outside of Tuscon shimmers in that magical desert light.  I loved the shots of Wendy's home....a hippie's dream!  Likewise the Prep School is lovingly shot...beautiful Spring trees in blossom and green lawns.  The staff at the school is first seen as annoying but they come around, too, and help Ellis find himself.  The pot that Goat Man has tried to send to Ellis never comes through and he is forced to go out for track and finds that he is a pretty good runner.  There is an interesting subplot  -- an almost-romance with a pretty, blond, town girl.  I thought the film handled it very nicely.  I liked Ellis' room mate, too....another stock character who manages to rise above his ""type.""

This is a low key, pleasant film that entertains us while telling a very believable tale of how a young boy grows into himself.",1350086400,4,3292,4.551020408163265

This is not great, not anything to make you change your mind about life, but a very fine portrait of a badly parented young man trying hard to navigate between selfish and self-absorbed people and somehow manage to grow up. How he manages to realize whom he can trust and whom he cannot is well done.

Life is confusing, with multiple temptations. Realizing that it may be best to avoid what looks delightful is an essential part of growing to adulthood. Most of the ""adults"" in here have not learned that. Even the ones that look ""cool."" And it avoids a couple of clichs I thought it was illegal to not include.

We kept looking at each other and wondering how and why we were supposed to care about this poor little rich boy with his prep school malaise and having to choose between two spoiled rich parents; o, the tragedy of it all. The script has moments but they're all somewhat rote, and it all feels glossed over to a large extent.

Despite some occasional laughs and decent if not great acting, Goats never does much more than trudge along a path that's pleasant enough but never really reveals any serious beauty or revelation.",1348704000,2,618,4.618181818181818

5140697,4,B0088749H2,"This is quite a different atmosphere for a coming of age story through and around ... Goats?  Yes, goats. Christopher Neil directs this film with charming style and abundant laughs.  I was trepidatious about renting this one.  While this may not be to everybody's liking, it works all the way around for me.

This movie is really about 15-year-old Ellis (Graham Phillips) who is surrounded by a most colorful family.  He is ready to go his own way from Tucson to Gates Prep School on the East Coast, the same school his father, Frank (Ty Burrell), went to before him and the area where he has been living now.

His mother, whom he calls Wendy by name, (Vera Farmiga, who shines in this) is a mix of the spiritual and New Age philosophies floating around in her own self-absorbed reality bubble. If you can rope in Wendy's personality in a couple of sentences you are far better spoken than I.

Goat Man (David Duchovny) or Javier, take your pick, is a 'botanist' and an experienced goat-trekker, who is hired by Wendy to keep up the place along with her.  Residing in the pool house, he tends to his ever growing garden and ... goats.  These two have raised Ellis in an offbeat style, along with a huge amount love.  Once you do get to know them they quickly become very genuine.

Quite simply, Ellis leaves for school and is greeted with an alternate way of life that he easily learns to excel in.  While there, he meets up with his father for the first time in years of absence. Frank has been avoiding his ex-wife Wendy.

Frank is re-married to Judy (Keri Russell) now, with a baby brother on the way. Their lifestyle is easily recognizable as affluent.  While Ellis' father may first appear emotionally vacant, Judy (being much younger) is right on target with Ellis and readily able to befriend him to bridge the gap between father and son.

Wendy stays behind with Goat Man and takes up with a new jealous lover, Bennett (Justin Kirk - perfect in this).  He screens every call and doesn't give Ellis' messages to Wendy, he wouldn't, being that he is a convincingly arrogant prig enjoying keeping Wendy to himself.  They lose touch, because of his interference, and Wendy loses control going more into her spiritual side, well, her altogether self (?)

In this film, watch a Thanksgiving dinner (ala Wendy) take on new meaning with Goat Man, Bennett, and several others present.  Ellis chooses to go to Frank's home ... Wendy didn't get that phone call either.

*Also included is a nice cameo appearance with Minnie Driver if you catch it.

This indie film plays out as one set-up after another onto some depth and hilarity, in a much more subtle way than being hysterical.  Like the other reviewers, I agree with the 'sit back and enjoy' theme of Ellis' journey to find himself.  This movie is one that you wouldn't need to overthink, analyze or anything, but laugh.

As far as Goat Man ... ""He knows the desert well and he'll be fine""

{If there is any questioning of the Minnie Driver cameo, while streaming you can catch a great shot of her at 01:34:05.  She is also listed on IMDb as a Shaman, uncredited}",1348012800,8,3115,4.577617328519856
