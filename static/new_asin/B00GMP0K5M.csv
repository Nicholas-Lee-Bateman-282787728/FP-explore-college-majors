Unfortunately, I had to return it, the quality was so bad you can even see the imagine clear enough, and the sound was so bad. So i am waiting to see if they offer a better quality of movie so I can re-order it. I'm checking off an on to see, if I can find this movie.",1401840000,,405,3.6136363636363638
