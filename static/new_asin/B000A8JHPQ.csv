There's a few clothing choices, hairstyles and music that let you know when it was made but apart from that if it was remade today there wouldn't be much difference in the finished product.  Now being Australian I'm happy to admit we have made some pretty average movies but rest assured this is not one of them.

The plot of the Big Steal - Danny has been trying to work up the courage to ask out a girl at his high school (Joanna) for years.  When he finally does he adds that he's got a car, when she's not impressed by this he tells her it's a Jag.  Only problem for Danny is that his car is a hideous uncool old Nissan Cedric so Danny decides to visit a used car dealer and actually buy an old Jag.  Conned by a salesman he returns with his friends so they can check out the car while he signs the contracts. The car engine is great, only problem is when Danny goes out on the date the engine dies and sputters oil all over Joanna, Danny learns the dealer has switched engines before he took possession of the car.  Danny and his friends come up with a grand scheme to get the engine back, give the car dealer his comeuppance and win back Joanna.  Danny also has to cope with Joanna's overprotective father and his own eccentric parents who were shattered when he traded their beloved Cedric (given to him as a gift days before on his 18th) which had been a part of their life and memories for decades.

The Big Steal is an hilarious movie.  DVD features are - heaps of cast interviews from both 1990 and 2003, original cast audition tapes, interviews with the directors, original trailer, other Australian movie trailers that were made around the same time as this film, plus audio commentary of the entire movie.

IF you like movies where bad guys get their comeuppance, wrongs are righted and you sit back and laugh along the way then The Big Steal is for your collection.  Enjoy!",1195430400,,2001,4.349462365591398

His portrayal of a dodgy car salesman is so spot on. Also interesting to see early performances from now well-known actors like claudia Carvan. This is the sort of movie Aussie do very well....",1129248000,,334,4.982142857142857
