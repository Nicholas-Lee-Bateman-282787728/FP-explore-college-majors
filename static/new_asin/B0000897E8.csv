1832979,1,B0000897E8,"I didn't even want to give this movie 1 star. I reccomend that all of you avoid this movie like the plague. I hope every actor in this film never gets to star in another film.  This film is a pathetic recreation one of my favorite films ""Big Deal on Madonna St.""  Not one moment ""Weclome to Collingwood"" was pleasant to me.  Why? Cause everything about it was poorly excecuted and cheap. The worst part of all of it was poor delivery of the jokes in the film. I didn't even laugh once.
Watching this film was like watching a street vendor sell fake Gucci bags and Bolex watches.",1074902400,3,578,4.284403669724771
1832980,4,B0000897E8,"This ""small-heist-went-terribly-awry"" film has its own charm, which might or might not appeal to you.  It is not the story that counts; it's the characters you enjoy watching, and the terrific cast give this light-weight film some good reason for you to watch.
The film's opening scene should not be missed; four guys in tattered and sooty clothes standing in the street, all staring vacantly in the air.  What happened to them?  The film goes back to the chain of events leading up to the first moment.

And the story is simple; Cosimo (Luiz Guzman) hears a story about a big deal from the guy in jail.  The deal of stealing from a jewelry shop, and Cosimo knows how to break in there.  Cosimo tells it to his love Rosalind, who tells it to another, who tells ... and finally, five guys in Colinwood get together around the plan.  Now let me introduce these lovable guys.  They are: down-and-out boxer Pero (Sam Rockwell, great as usual); Riley, failed artist who had to sell his camera to buy diapers (William H. Macy, never better with Mel Gibson-like sideburns); Leon, Dandy of Colinwood (Isaiah Washington); Toto, too kind and too old maybe for the job (Michael Jeter): and Basil, who falls in love with the sister of his buddy Leon at first sight (Andrew Davoli).  And they are all broke.
You got also the cameo of cast-against-type George Clooney (see his disguise), and Gabrielle Union (""Bring it on"").
The film's approach to the material is downplayed, so the humor is the kind of what you call 'dead-pan' or ""off-beat.'  You might not find the film not so amusing.  After all, potentially the film is talking about the losers who remain losers.  They are likable in spite of (and because of) their utter silliness, and their silliness is mingled with sadness.  But that is exactly the charm of the film.  To realize this, the actors did splendid job, especially Macy, Rockwell and Jeter.
Another merit of the film is its music by Mark Mothersbaugh, ex-""DEVO.""  His bouncing jazzy guitar music gives another joy for watching the film.
""Welcome to Colinwood"" is, as its credit shows, a remake of Italian film ""I Soliti Igonoti,"" usually called Vittorio Gassman's ""Big Deal on Madonna Street.""  This old-Italian film, itself a parody of noir genre, has already spawned several similar films -- such as ""Palookaville"" and ""Crackers.""  Compare them with ""WTC.""",1066089600,12,2365,4.814356435643564
1832981,2,B0000897E8,"I seem to be in a minority here, but I honestly did not find Welcome To Collinwood funny at all. I was looking forward watching and enjoying the film though, since the trailer offered so much promise, but as I came to expect from a lot of movies, unfortunately what you watch in the trailers are the best bits of the film!
The problem with Welcome to Collinwood (a gang of 'idiots planning to pull off a big heist, called bellini) is not the acting, since all the cast is made of fine actors, especially William Macy, so the blame falls firmly on the script. It has more holes than swiss cheese, and the laughter is as sparse as Siberian nighclubs! The main problems with the script lies in the following,
The characters are just too caricaturized, without funny dialogue. The 'silliness' of the too many characters are just too overblown, without it being a parody a la Top Secert or Naked Gun.
The character of the always excellent Luiz Guzman was central to the whole plot, but then when he escapes jail and vowes revenge for cutting him out of his 'bellini',I expected to see more of him later, but he just totally disappeared from the movie without any explanation!!!
The character of the sexy Jennifer Esposito was too shallow, and I really did expect a certain twist, or surprise from her, which alas did not happen. The fact that she is loose (or liberated) and has too many boyfriends at the same time, even inviting two of them to the same party which results in a fight, was just over emphasized in an annoying sort of way.
George Clooney's cameo was in my opinion unnecessary. His presence surely would attract more viewers, but his scenes did not add anything to the movie, and it would maybe have worked better, had these scenes been replaced by more 'misadventures' of the gang.
Brother directors/filmmakers have been quite a 'hip' phenomenon in Hollywood ever since the Coen bothers shot their masterpiece Blood Simple, and we have seen many such teams so far, like the Farley and Hughes brothers, and the Russos are yet another siblings team.(I was thinking Welcome to Collinwood was mediocre with two directors, what would it be like with one??)
If you want 'idiots pulling a hiest' movie then The Apple Dumpling Gang with genuis performances by Don Knotts and Tim Conway is still the best, although it has a 'kiddie' 'Sunday afternoon' tag to it, it is still a very funny film for all, and forget about Welcome to Collinwood. But if you are still interested to check it out then watch the trailer,trust me it is enough.",1065139200,5,2538,4.629711751662971
1832982,5,B0000897E8,"What a great little movie.  I had never heard of this, but it popped up on my recommendations and got good reviews, so I gave it a try.  This so much reminded me of Donald Westlake's comic crime caper novels.  A great little story with plenty of laughs.  The plot involves a group of low rent, misfit criminals trying to pull of a heist of a lifetime, or as the call it, their 'Bellini'.  Well, complications occur, problems arise, and the whole thing gets rather messy.  William H. Macy is great along with Isaiah Washington, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and Luis Guzman.  A great ensemble cast in a highly enjoyable, funny movie.  A sad note, I had heard Michael Jeter died recently, which is quite sad.  I thought he was great in the Green Mile.",1054166400,11,748,4.481481481481482
1832983,4,B0000897E8,"Yes, it's not a perfect movie, and for once, George Clooney was the least enjoyable character.  But, damn if this flick didn't make me laugh pretty hard a few times.  It's silly and not intended to be anything but light entertainment.  What's interesting to note is that three of the main characters were in 'The Green Mile', and three of them were in 'Out of Sight'.",1050969600,5,367,4.53030303030303
1832984,4,B0000897E8,"""Welcome to Collinwood"" is a small, simple but fun story of misfit criminals trying to land the heist of a lifetime.
Sure this is a story we've all seen before, but ""Welcome to Collinwood"" is a wonderfully scripted and acted film that avoids tired clichs. It feels new, like something we've never seen before despite the truth, and that's the mark of a good film.
The excellent cast is what really helps move along the good script treatment. William H. Macy is, as always, a great addition, but it's Sam Rockwell and the late Michael Jeter that really stand out. I happened to watch this for the first time the day I found out Jeter died, and his fantastic off-the-wall character, a trademark of his, made me realize just how much I will miss his film presence.
This is just a smart little indie film that, while not particularly memorable, is plenty of fun and is much better then much of the schlock Hollywood throws together. Definitely worth a rental, and maybe more if you love those quirky little crime films.",1049241600,5,1015,4.613259668508287

1833095,5,B0000897E8,"Quite simply, this is one of my favorite films.

It kills me to think that it did so poorly in the box office (it made $336,620 with a $12 million budget according to Wikipedia).  From its lukewarm reviews, it's clear that most moviegoers don't share my enthusiasm.  Frankly I can't figure out why.  This movie is hysterically funny from start to finish.

All of its characters are sympathetic and, no matter how self-centered and amoral they might appear, they manage somehow to redeem themselves to the audience.  Their coarse world comes across as plausible and endearing, even warm and inclusive.  The acting is outstanding, the story is witty, and the overall mood is uplifting.  George Clooney has one of the funniest cameos I've ever seen.  The romantic subplots are charming and amusing without the usual Hollywood heavy-handedness.  The screenplay is surrealistic and draws viewers into a kind of altered reality.  It's as though they're in on a joke that eludes the cast.  Even the silly intro music adds to the movie's ambiance.

What's not to like?  I've never reviewed a film for Amazon before and when I read how poorly it did, I felt compelled to add my two cents and to try to change the record encouraging people to try it out.

In my apparently perverse opinion, ""Welcome to Collinwood"" is an understated gem.",1291507200,,1327,4.835555555555556
1833096,5,B0000897E8,"I stumbled acroos this movie when it was almost over. It took several times before I saw it in its entirety. It belongs in the same class as Blazing Saddles. Actors, Clooney, Macy and Isaih Washington are shown in non traditional roles which makes for fall on the floor laughing.",1235865600,,279,4.6
1833097,4,B0000897E8,"I cannot say how many times I laughed during this film. I'm really at a loss for how some of the other reviewers were disappointed. I have seen the original ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" and although I generally find foreign films much better than their American counterparts, I like ""Collinwood"" much better. It's funnier, for one thing. The comedy has better delivery, the characters are more solid, and the story more clear.

It is very easy to sympathize with these characters despite all their faults, dishonesty, and criminal behavior. Don't be mistaken - there are some very human moments to offset the funny parts. There are many one-liners, quips, arguments, friendly insults, physical humor, scheming, and the overall situation of never getting things quite right during an attempted heist.

What a great cast too - every one of them perfectly selected for their roles. I love this movie. Not too light and not too heavy. It's just right. Great soundtrack too. This movie was in the official selection at Cannes in 2002.",1195084800,3,1029,4.942196531791907

1833099,5,B0000897E8,"This movie had me laughing all the way.

It all takes place as a crook gets nabbed for grand theft auto. Right away he is hauled off and forced to share the cell with a man who has a funny secret and traditionally wants to pass it onto someone before he dies laughingly. But this is not a story about the old man. This is a story of a group of not-too-smart criminals in pulling off a master of a 'belini', what is referred to in the film as the Big Hiest.

But first, they need a 'Lavenski', a person to take the wrap for the man in jail, you'll find that the movie makes up a lot of words but you'll get the hang of understanding them all.

The group is formed when each member is requested to become the lavinski for the mere sum of 15,000 dollars. But, in telling that person, the word spreads, as they search for a lavinski, of the job and of it's grand total that racks into close to 300,000 dollars.

These bumbling knuckle heads pay tribute to the likes of THE THREE STOOGES and THE MARXX BROTHERS in their gags and criminal endeavors. Some of the humor is in your face at times but there are other times where it's just crossing wittiness and absoultely gut-busting funny. The best character in this movie would have to be The hunching old man with red hair. He's the classic old-timer crook who sometimes doesn't have a clue.

You'll fall in love with this homage to heist comedies. It has a 1930's flavor but the time period is never really annoucned in the movie. But the costumes play a role in dipicting the fictionalized town.

Also, be on the look out for GEORGE CLOONEY who plays a small role in the film, after all, of course he would, he's one of the executive producers.

This is a very funny movie that will have you laughing out loud. You may not like the ending but you'll love all of the gags in between.

Enjoy!",1143676800,3,1836,4.255747126436781
1833100,2,B0000897E8,"A remake of ""I Soliti Ignoti"" [""Big Deal on Madonna Street""], a Mario Monicelli masterpiece of italian cinema made almost 50 years ago, this plot takes place in a inner-city industrial urban neighborhood of Cleveland.  Having seen the italian original, it is remarkable how the same characters are cloned to modern-day cleveland.  For example, the uptight and old-fashioned Michele from Sicily is now a stylish afro-american that could be a pimp.  But while the original had a beat to it that engaged the story to evolve from one scene to the next, as a good page-turner book would do, this remake languished.  The original had a really good musical beat that acted as a ""page turner"".  This one does not.  Too bad:  we need more independent and local film production, but more post-production here would have helped, also to speed up the pace in today's even-more accelerating expectations from the audience.",1122508800,,909,4.9801324503311255

 Bad news first ... I was disappointed in Clooney's role. Good news ... that was all I was disappointed in. THis movie was a laugh riot from beginning to end while at the same time conveying an endearing pathos. This is the first time I have ever seen a criminal caper movie and felt sorry for and touched by the lives of the criminals, even while I was laughing MAO.
