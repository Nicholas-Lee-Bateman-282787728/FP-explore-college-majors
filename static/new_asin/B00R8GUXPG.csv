6902007,4,B00R8GUXPG,"I love the movie, so 4 stars there.  Wanted to watch it again so purchased thru Amazon Prime Digital.  THE QUALITY IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN!  Squiggly lines through the movie, dark and blurry.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY buy the DVD instead or use another source to buy from.  Note: All the other videos I've bought from Amazon are great so this was a huge surprise and huge disapointment.",1533254400,,388,4.408450704225352
6902008,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I've always enjoyed movies with a little bit of fantasy (think Lord of the Rings), but I'm was thinking Marvel comics made into a movie was taking it too far.  My son wanted to watch it with me and I loved it.  The soundtrack for this was also great...The humor in the entire movie is laugh out loud funny!",1533168000,,306,4.169491525423729

6902013,5,B00R8GUXPG,amazing,1533081600,,7,7.0
6902014,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I admit that on the first watch, Guardians Of The Galaxy didn't totally hook me.  I felt that the comedic elements clashed with the rest of the big epic feel.  But after seeing Guardians 2 (and later Avengers: The Infinity War) I gave the movie another chance and was bowled over by how much better I liked it this time.  I'd expected I might like it better because I enjoyed Guardians 2 so much from the first time I watched it, but I wasn't expecting Guardians 1 to pick up by this much.  I'm now a convert - the comedic parts and the rest of the movie now seem an excellent match to me.

I liked the visuals and the cast of characters from the first watch on.  I'm now much more into the story and the way it was delivered though.  Multiple characters, alone or in groups, are searching for an artifact, an ancient metallic orb, containing within it an Infinity Stone, one of the most powerful objects in the universe.  The searchers include an Earthman who grew up in space, named Peter Quill (he prefers the name Starlord, but can't really get the name to catch on with anyone else), a pair of bounty hunters consisting of a walking tree named Groot and a bipedal, talking, machine gun-toting raccoon named Rocket (just don't call him a raccoon, he's very touchy about that), and the forces of Ronan, an alien Kree deeply opposed to his civilization's peace treaty with their traditional enemies on Xandor, which he now wants to destroy.  Two of his agents are Gamorra and Nebula, two 'daughters' of the mad immortal Thanos, who turns his adopted children into living weapons; the pair are sent by Thanos to aid Ronan in his vendetta against Xandor in return for Ronan's relinguishing the Stone to Thanos after Xandor's destruction.  Through a series of events and encounters, some intense and others deliberately farcical (in a good way), several of the searchers end up teaming up to oppose Ronan, finding themselves allied with another alien, Drax, who doesn't start off looking for the Stone but is looking to avenge the deaths of his wife and daughter at Ronan's hands.

Guardians Of The Galaxy is quite different from most of the other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, but its peculiarities and eccentricities are now pluses in my book rather than minuses.  Visually, the movie is awesome (I have to mention that I'd been waiting to see an actual Celestial in a live-action movie basically since I could read) and the characters are among the best in the MCU.  I think my favorites in this one are Nebula followed closely by Groot, but I like all the main players, all the different races, all the exotic alien technology, the whole lot of it.  And I now consider the Guardians movies as indispensable to the MCU as, say, the Avengers movies.",1533081600,,2754,4.639917695473251

6902246,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I remember when this first came out thinking that this was for children and seemed silly in comparison to other MCU films like Iron Man for example.

I'm so glad I gave these a chance because they are amazing. A perfect blend of action, comedy and emotion that works well for the entire family. There is something in there for everybody. Which is the reason this series has been so successful.

The cast just clicks together so well. Chris Pratt is great as Star-Lord. Zoe Saldana is so unique and likeable as Gamora. Dave Batista is so funny as Drax. Then you have Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel lending their talents to bring the amazing duo of Rocket and Groot come to life.

If you enjoy comic book based movies then you will love this series. If you don't enjoy comic book based movies.... odds are you will love this movie anyways. Its different and so good.",1526688000,,863,4.484076433121019

From the scene of Peter dancing through the cavern, I was hooked; and the rest of the movie kept my eyes glued to the screen. I could find no fault with any of the cast - they were all great. I had wondered how Diesel and Cooper would do with their characters, but their relationship came across with no problem. But Peter's slow realization of what ""I am/we are Groot"" means was special.",1525305600,,563,4.165137614678899

6902445,3,B00R8GUXPG,"Marvel's Cinematic Universe continues to produce some really great stuff. This one is particularly interesting as it seems to break from the more serious elements of other stories and well... Lets just say if Star Wars and Pulp Fiction were a couple that had a baby, this movie would be their child.

There is a serious story with some comedy and a comedy with some drama. This movie is the latter, but this has some great moments. Not much of a Marvel Comics fan but I have been a fan of their adapted works and of course the MCU. Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Agents of SHIELD, Nick Fury, etc. However, I've never heard of this one before. It looked strange to me, but I sat in a theater and watched I got to admit I enjoyed it. Its a motley crew of men, woman and odd intelligent beings who come together to end up saving the planet. A human that was abducted by aliens to grow up an intergalactic pirate, an orphaned girl to become the assassin of a warlord, a widowed warrior thirsting for revenge, a sentient plant and an animal turned intelligent turned into a pack of thieves. Put them together as they try to make their way in the galaxy end up in the wrong place in the wrong time... to become heroes.

Plenty of awkward comedy, yet with great action. Marvel does a great job in turning some modest actors into superstars. Chris Pratt is a long way from being a goofball and turns into a grand hero in Peter ""Starlord"" Quill, Dave Batista pulls a Dwayne Johnson in that he's a pro-wrestling champion turned into an awesome action star in Drax, Zoe Saldana adds another great performance as Gamora, Vin Diesel as Groot and Bradley Cooper as Rocket.

Great experience at the movie theater, Blu-ray and Digital Copy.",1518739200,3,1748,4.507886435331231

6902575,4,B00R8GUXPG,"guardians of the Galaxy is the Star Wars of Superhero films.  Its an old fashioned adventure through the Universe, and involves a team of misfits who attempt to stop a powerful evildoer from destroying everything.

The best part about Guardians is the comedy.  Films like this are almost always taken too serious, or like the Star Wars prequel films, the jokes just fall flat.  Here, the comedy actually works, and large part of it is because of the excellent cast.

The film does suffer from a convoluted plot.  There is a lot going on, and a lot of backstory about the characters is not really explored.  You have to pay attention or you will get confused quickly.  A lot of this is because this film is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the writers have to tie all the films together.  As a result, we have two almost identical bad guys, one of which plays almost no role at all except to tie Guardians to the Avengers series.

With the large number of characters in this film, it almost seems like it would have worked better as a tv series along the lines of Firefly, but since this is the first film in a series, then these supporting characters will obviously be more fleshed out in the sequels.",1514332800,,1211,4.488584474885845

It's reminiscent of the humor in Galaxy Quest, although not a spoof of Star Trek, of course and not really a comedy.  The characters are likable, especially Groot, the tree-like being.  Fast moving and action-packed, it's one of the best newer sci-fi movies I've seen.  The 2nd movie is even better than this because it has a lot of very touching scenes.

6902835,5,B00R8GUXPG,"A really excellent movie that many have liked better than the original. I'm torn between liking this over the original, but I'm also very fortunate to be alive to have such 'Old School' movies with no pointless except to continue Hollywood's brainwashing of the American public making it seem  homosexual lifestyles are typical. Plus an even bigger bonus for me with these two movies and all that might follow. No Rap garbage! Instead it has all songs from Quill's mothers cassette tape mixes from music if the 1970s!! YAY!! Finally, truly awesome music with no worries of some rap, trance, hip hop, or other computer based so called music from the turn of the millennium! Ah, what a joy!

Bonus points for Dave Bautista for scoring a massive success in his acting career. Such a long way from being a WWE wrestler of high caliber to movies such as Riddick, then here as the wonderful scene stealing 'straight man' which is a comedic term for some being funny who is supposed to be unaware of being funny, but instead serious. Comedians such as Abbott from Abbott & Costello. Dean Martin from Martin & Lewis. So many things that have been lost in the 'progress' this country has made in the past several decades.

I've developed several projects working professionally as a programmer and 3D artist with various teams in California. I have some perspective about what it might take to create a project like this and how challenging it really is to breathe life into it. I'm absolutely astounded by this film. It's work like this that inspires all of us to achieve more.

To Marvel, Disney and all of those who were involved in this masterpiece, you have my gratitude.

Thank you and good luck,

6903116,5,B00R8GUXPG,"First of all, I am really not a person who goes for this certain superhero-type genre. In fact, my husband had to cajole me to go to a big screen theater to see this one and did I ever Love this action filled fun story filled with the actors and two exclusive character's voices of Bradley Cooper and his sidekick Vin Diesel. Beginning with a dancing Chris Pratt (Star Lord) to an electric and eclectic soundtrack overflowing with earlier generations of music. This has love stories in several ways besides the central theme too, a sarcasm that is done perfectly which I am a fan of in the humor and massive CGI filling the big screen which I usually don't care as much about as the acting. See this on a large screen - if possible - with great sound. On the other-hand, this film was a spectacle; a feast for your eyes and your ears and definitely a great time. Before anyone like me who usually goes for drama or romantic comedies shuns this space romp, give this a look as I think you will not be disappointed. I even bought the Rocket 'action figure' for a Christmas gift following the film. It was such fun at the movie theater that I purchased the Blu-ray for my enthused husband and, let's face it, me too! Sounds and looks great on our large screen and surround sound stereo. I will be getting the second volume of this when it is released too. I suggest, though, to see this first.

I have some perspective about what it might take to create a project like this and how challenging it really is to breathe life into it. I'm absolutely astounded by this film. It's work like this that inspires all of us to achieve more.

The film is backed with lots of vintage Rock and Pop hits which will appeal to older viewers. With GOTG Vol. 2 still playing on theaters, this offers a chance to see the original for the first time for those who missed it and an opportunity to revisit it for those who have seen it before. This is definitely NOT your usual comic book movie!",1497052800,,491,4.466666666666667
6903289,4,B00R8GUXPG,Good movie part 2 was better...,1497052800,,31,4.333333333333333
6903290,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Current day, but in a galaxy far far away, Peter Quill steals an orb, not really knowing how valuable it is. He's part of the Ravagers, a loose-knit gang of thieves for hire. The leader is blue-faced Yondu Udonta, who has raised Quill in the thieving life after abducting him as a kid from Earth in 1988. When Yondu finds out that Quill is keeping the orb for himself, he is furious, ""When I picked you up on Terra, these boys of mine wanted to eat you. They ain't never tasted any Terran before."" Maybe even Yondu will use his Yaka Arrow on Quill, a killing weapon supreme, directed by just a whistle.

So now Quill has Yondu after him as well as Gamora, a green-skinned assassin working for the treacherous Kree, and two bounty-hunters, Rocket and Groot. When the four of them are arrested and jailed together, they find meet Drax the Destroyer. The improbable five escape jail together, and from there on this becomes a buddy movie. With aliens. And fighting and spaceships and LOTS of comedy.

""Guardians of the Galaxy"", now known as Vol. 1 because a sequel came out in 2017, hit the theaters in 2014. It is part of the Marvel world and one of the best, in my opinion, with humor and heart. Sometimes the comic pauses are not necessarily realistic, but the movie shows lots of creativity, such as said Yaka Arrow, and the planet of Knowhere, built inside the decapitated head of a giant celestial being.

Rocket and Groot are CGI, with Groot fashioned on the voice and studio motion capture of Vin Diesel. Diesel was not actually on set, though. Another actor holding a head high gave the other actors something to act with.  Overall, the producers report that the film has 2,750 visual effects shots, comprising 90% of the film. That's a lot of green screen. The prison, however, was a real set. As director James Gunn said, ""Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel.""

On disc, you can view the 121 minute film with a choice of spoken languages: English, French or Spanish in 5.1 Dolby Digital, as well as English 2.0 Descriptive Audio. Subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish.

There are two Bonus Features:
A. ""Exclusive Look at Marvels 'Avenger's Age of Ultron"" (3 minutes) This a making of featurette, has comments by Kevin Feige (producer), Joss Whedon (director), Jeremy Latcham (executive producer) and Elizabeth Olsen (plays Scarlet Witch). The movie includes filming in England, NY, South Korea and South Africa.
B. Deleted Scene (1 minute)
C. Sneak Peeks. Previews of other Marvel movies and video game.

I didn't actually buy ""Guardians of the Galaxy 1"" until after I'd seen the sequel. A very good pair of movies.

6903323,2,B00R8GUXPG,"Boring. Unimaginitive. All the aliens in the film basically have the same culture as typical Americans. Chris Pratt's comedy gimmicks are standard 2014 jokes, even though his character did not grow up on earth... Stupid. Same ""teamwork saves the day"" moral -which is also stupid. The bad guy is another emo freak -like disney's other emo bad guy in force awakens. This movie was as lame as its trailer. I want my 2 hours of life back.",1496620800,2,434,4.64935064935065

6903327,3,B00R8GUXPG,"I finally saw it earlier this year and I was kind of underwhelmed. I think the problem may lie in the fact that I have heard so much about it from so many people that it was built up in my head to be this hilarious movie extravaganza (the same thing happened to me with Napoleon Dynamite, though years later I came back and watched that and enjoyed it). Expectations can ruin anything! I didn't really buy Chris Pratt as being a womanizer. And the way the rest of the misfits fell into place just felt thin. There were no real moments of bonding where they forged friendship in the fires of danger. They were like ""hey, we're a team now!"" So, I'll give it a few years and try again and probably love it. That being said, I'm seeing the second one soon so I don't have the same issue. Maybe it's great?",1496534400,,801,4.207792207792208

I am utterly amazed that this is marketed as a children's movie. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR KIDS. I am kicking myself in the butt for giving in to the media schemes. My two kids, ages 5 and 7 did not and could not enjoy this movie. From first second to the last it is all filled with violence. It has no damn plot. Just fighting, yelling, swearing, pain and suffering. The characters, although they may look cute, are grown adults, and nothing about their decision making is child-like in any way. It is not even funny, like, at all. We literally couldn't finish it, it was so bad!! Seriously save your time and money!! I am so embarassed I gave Amazon $3.99 for this garbage!!",1496188800,4,825,4.261146496815287

But it wasn't; The writing is flat, the jokes are forced, the characters are unlikable (Chris Pratt is usually charming, here he is just a dick). Even for a movie written by a 15 year old, the situations and ""relationships"" are even too implausible for a comic book movie. Oh right, it wasn't written by a 15 year old. I keep forgetting.
Did I mention the set design? I can only imagine someone left a box of crayons on a radiator and called it a day. You think that's harsh? Try watching this neon Indiana Jones/Star Wars knock-off sober. I don't watch movies for CGI so if that's your thing go at it, but no amount of computers can cover the poor job so many people did to get this heap off the ground.

It's like a fun actiony funny cheesy 80's made in modern times. It has a great 1980's soundtrack. You come to care for all the characters like Peter Quill who was abducted from Earth as a young boy after his mom dies. Gamora, a beautiful (and green) assassin that works reluctantly for Thanos. Rocket and Groot, a genetically engineered raccoon-like bounty hunter and a tree-like humanoid. Finally, we meet Drax, a strong muscular warrior who seeks revenge against Ronan and Thanos for the death of his family. Together, this rag-tag group of misfits try to come together and stop Ronan from getting his hands on a powerful Orb and destroying the galaxy.

GOTG is great fun from start to finish, and it never takes itself too seriously. Its witty throughout, and even though the quality of the gags is a little uneven it never feels laboured. The casting is perfect  Chris Pratt in particular excels in his role. Its also visually stunning with some truly impressive effects and epic landscapes. GOTG does not break any new ground, and the story is entirely predictable, but due to its energy, honesty, and marvellous sense of humour all shortcomings can easily be forgiven.",1493510400,,675,4.869565217391305

I never thought I would shed tears for a tree that can only say one phrase, but here I am doing just that. Bradly Cooper gives Rocket such personality it's hard not to relate him to an actual person, and the relationship between Cooper's character and Diesel's is endearing and heartwarming. Zoe Saldana does an excellent job of making her plot line revolve around her characters desire to be out from under her ""father's"" thumb and the desire to do what is inherently good and moral.

6903572,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This seems far-fetched that I would become such a follower of Marvel comics. I never read them as a kid. Lo and behold, I have collected most of the Marvel character movies but THIS one, by far, is my favorite and absolutely entertaining. The lure is the music  - dated 80's music I remember fondly myself, and the acting; by a lovable cast of characters who embrace and run with their roles, including the voice of Bradley Cooper as a ""science gone wrong"", feisty, gun-weilding raccoon, with his soft spirited friend, a tree, named Groot. The dialogue is engaging and the humor is stellar!
My husband and I immediately watched it twice in one evening, then again and again, since! We sing the songs when we aren't watching the movie. We cannot wait to see the theater follow up, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (coming out May 5)! Our movie night (on my husband's birthday no less) is already planned.

6903580,4,B00R8GUXPG,"I came into this knowing nothing as my Marvel Comics knowledge stops at the mainstream Avengers characters (and even there I had no clue who Scarjo or Jeremy Renner were supposed to be let alone Samule L. in the movies). Anyway, I'm not too into the angsty way Marvel deals with people who get superpowers. I much prefer the Japanese model where superheroes just kick butt and don't think about why they can.

Anyway, saw the trailer for the Guardians 2 flick in the theater and it looked intriguing. So thought I should watch the first one to see if it'd be worth seeing #2 in the theater this month. All I can say is wow! The first hour of this one rocks to no end. Thought all the characters were well rounded and far more interesting than the Avengers ever are. The second hour seemed overly long and in need of maybe chopping 20 to 30 minutes out of it to get the story moving like it did in the 1st half of this.

As dumb as I thought casting the Fantastic Mr. Fox's cousin in this, the Rocky Racoon actually worked. The other wild thing is the cameos--Benicio del Toro? Glenn Close? I half expected De Niro or Pacino to pop up.

The extras are virtually nil on this DVD so just go watch On Demand really.",1491523200,,1211,4.279475982532751

If Amazon was smart they would come up with a PC compatible app similar to "" VUDU2GO "",  so you can download and view movies on your PC offline, which is why since I've made this mistake, I've started purchasing movies from VUDU, so I can enjoy movies in SD or HDX format offline on my PC, without having to purchase a kindle, or having to own a smart tv to view my purchases.

So disappointed once again to the lack of consideration for us folks who like to view movies on our PC and until Amazon comes up with an app like "" VUDU2GO "" you've lost me as an customer for movies in digital format.",1490918400,,828,4.098765432098766

6903673,3,B00R8GUXPG,"Actually I saw this on TV I admit I'm a science fiction nut  there needs to be something addressed. Guardians of the Galaxy is a campy and a little-over-the-top romp through a menagerie of creatures, situations, and fun. It opens with a gut-wrenching scene in a hospital and quickly takes you to the near future with the main character foraging for an orb, a very dangerous orb. The action quickly develops, as do the plot twists and the introduction of the other heroic characters who eventually unite to form a mismatched group consisting of a tree, a couple of aliens, a modified raccoon, and one human. But, somehow they congeal into a promising band of ""do-gooders."" Well, not exactly do-gooders, but they end up doing the right thing. Of course, they're kind of forced into banding together when Ronan, the resident bad guy, inflicts major havoc to get the orb. With spaceship chases, fights, weapons, and explosions, the whole thing is entirely enjoyable.
The special effects were fantastic. The acting was great. I even found myself chuckling several times at some of the humor that was cleverly woven into the script. All I can say is that Marvel has done it again.
However, I am concerned about something. Isaiah 5:20 says...
Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;
Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness;
Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
NowI know it's a comic book movie, but even the subtleties of humor and comic books can be used to contradict the word of God. As the Scripture above says, ""Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil."" I noticed in this movie, and other movies, a frequent theme where the outlaws, the killers, the liars, and the thieves become the heroes. I am not trying to be legalistic, but if I were writing a movie like that, being the Christian that I am, I could not in all good conscience make evildoers out to be the heroes. I'll leave it to you to judge whether or not my comments are appropriate or not.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie.

Lessons
One of the oldest lessons in the Bible can be seen in the way both Isaac and Jacob created problems by showing favoritism. Thanos, in the presence of both daughters Nebula and Gamora refers to the latter as his favorite. It is no wonder that Nebula hates her so. The Word of God expounds on the natural reaction to this and condemns its use as well.
Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age and he made a richly ornamented robe for him. When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. Genesis 37:3-7
My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism. James 2:1
Ronin admits early on, They call me terrorist, radical, zealot because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree, and punish those who do not. He sees himself as a deliverer of justice, as many do today, but his corrupt nature, as evidenced by his love of death, clouds his vision, as it will for all evil men, just as Solomon said,
Evil men do not understand justice. Proverbs 28:5
Drax has the singular focus of seeking revenge on Ronin for having killed his wife and daughter. His loss was great, but we understand the God of the Old and New Testament has always spoken with the same voice.
Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord. Leviticus 19:18
Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for Gods wrath, for it is written: It is mine to avenge; I will repay,  says the Lord. Romans 12:19
Gamora, a cold hearted, trained assassin since childhood when she herself was abducted, at a pivotal moment declares,  I have lived most of my life surrounded by my enemies. I would be grateful to die among my friends. She, just as the others, give proof of the kind of self-sacrifice that is rare but is to be treasured when found.
A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother. Proverbs 18:24
Along those same lines there are two great moments in the film, instances of a willingness to give up your life for others that are both profound and moving in their own way and should remind us of Jesus own words when he said, as a foreshadowing of his coming death
Greater love has no one than this: to lay down ones life for ones friends. John 15:13",1488240000,,4463,4.458996328029376

However, the 3D disc appears to have been edited by a film school flunky who thought the movie would have been better if they changed from the original 2.39:1 to a zoomed in 16:9 every other scene throughout the movie. Unless you're watching on an all 16:9 setup, save your money and buy the 2D only version.  This movie was not intended for fans of scope setups.",1486166400,,490,4.568181818181818

6903913,4,B00R8GUXPG,"The Guardians of the Galaxy is served best on the biggest screen you can with the best sound system you've got. Don't watch this on your Kindle if you've got a choice.

Why? Big spaceships, fun music, excellent fight scenes and a lot going on that will get lost on the small screen. I projected mine onto a 100"" screen with stereo speakers, and wished I saw this in the theater.

A few negatives, though.

Bradley Cooper's Rocket character -- his portrayal was disappointingly cliche. He didn't feel genuine. Rocket is complex and we barely see a glimpse. The writers did no favors with his lines.

I wanted more backstory to Peter Quill. So much didn't make sense within the context of the movie.

Nebula, played by the lovely Karen Gillan (of Dr. Who fame and beyond), was under-developed.

Rocket's profanity. However necessary or true to the character it might be (no disputing that), I decided not to show the movie to my little boy.

Overall, I liked it and hope to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 when it hits the cinema.

Fun and a little inappropriate, and watching a talking racoon was not as bad as I imagined.  And I loved the 70's music theme.

6904098,3,B00R8GUXPG,Filled with marvel/comic book cliches this movie does stand on it's own as a comedic space adventure that has excellent dialog and vauge villain motive. The characters are stark and likable however in true comic book fashion a capable character is reduced to a romantic sub plot because marvel can't have a story without one so the only female got detoured to a blushing maiden. The chi is so amazing it's worth watching just for the space scenes,1483315200,,446,4.730769230769231

6904132,3,B00R8GUXPG,It's entertaining.  I am a little humor impaired so not really a film for me.  One scene was so far from science that it ruined the climax for me.  A similar thing happened with the infinity stones. Though obviously not based on science it was distracting how far removed it was from Marvel lore.  Clearly I am too serious for this film.,1482969600,2,337,4.387096774193548

6904282,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Great combination of action and humor. Of course, the action, like in most of these super hero, pseudo-sci-fi fantasy movies is unbelievable but if you can ignore that aspect you can sit back and have a really good time. By ""unbelievable"" I mean one being having the strength and energy to fight off dozens of well-armed attackers, people miraculously surviving falls or explosions that would rip any real-world being to pieces or leave them hopelessly disabled. But you expect that sort of thing in movies such as this so--what the hey.

The actors do an excellent job of bringing the characters to life. The fast pacing and smart-ass humor keep the action moving so that there is never a dull moment. In fact, there is so much going on in the this movie that it is worth re-watching just to try to pick up things you probably missed the first time around.",1481587200,,857,4.6381578947368425

My entire family loves it. My 14 year old begged me for it. There are some moments that are a bit inappropriate for my younger kids, but I'm the kind of parent who sits down to explain things, and if the content is good and it's a classic, I sometimes let certain things slide. I'm usually pretty picky with what I do let slide as many PG-13 movies are terribly inappropriate and even should be rated R, but this wasn't as bad as some and fit the bill for content, so I was okay with them watching it. Two out of three kids were Guardians of the Galaxy characters for Halloween and my husband was Groot. If you haven't seen this, just try it on.

Somehow I had gained a poor opinion of it, I'm not sure how, but it turned out to not just be a great movie but one my grandkids just love, and I am happy for them to watch it.  It has some of the most redeeming values and principles I have seen in movies in a while - loyalty, honor, demonstrations of what true love is - that one would lay their lives down for their friends.  My grandkids started watching it and when my 7 yr old grandson was turning heads in the grocery store singing old 70's classic songs from the movie word for word, I had to watch it with him.  Chris Pratt was just great, and Zoe Saldana wowed as a green space woman.  Rocket, Groot, the big strong guy who I can't remember his name, some of the best original characters - and character development - I've seen in a while and it was effortless.  Great soundtrack, incredible although a little bit confusing story line, just a really solid movie I'm proud to own and watch as a family for years.  Thanks James Gunn and team.

My 11 yr.old and I watched movies in the Marvel Universe in order and when we came across this one we were less than enthusiastic, thinking is that a raccoon? So glad my son wanted to watch it. Exciting and smart, all the characters are great. Doesn't spend first half on Serious Origin Story (hello Spider-Man), after one brief flashback you get to know some backstory through quick paced action. The movie respects the audience enough to skip explanation too, you won't miss it. Believe me you don't need to know where Groot came from to love him. Doesn't have Seriously Dark Brooding Hero syndrome (hello Dark Knight), our main man has plenty of sad baggage to get you invested but is light hearted too. Chris Pratt provides a perfect balance without veering into Doesn't Take Anything Seriously (hello Iron Man). Don't misunderstand I love each each movie mentions above but it's fun to see these stories told in different ways. Even Star Trek fans will dig it, hot green chick alert. Zoe Zaldana rocks it as usual. Enjoy!",1476921600,,1092,4.752631578947368

6904632,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This is a new set of Marvel heroes that I was not familiar with until my kids briefed me and bought me up to speed.

With so many different things happening at Marvel nowadays - it is hard to tell when (what year) things are happening. Take the new Marvel Avenger ""Civil War"" movie for example. In this very recent movie - Spider Man is a real young kid still in high school with pimples and awful costume.
What about all the previous (and terrific) Spider-Man Movies where he is in college? Who knows? Who cares? We're selling tickets here babe!

I believe ""Guardians"" is set in our time period, same as the Avengers (Why? because ""Star Lord"" is taken from Earth as a young child  in our time period and is NOT delivered to his Dad as he was supposed to be), but now he is grown up and lives in a distant part of the galaxy. Great characters, great adventure, great directing, funny and serious all at one time. A great film with a lot of fun. Get snacks and a blanket and watch the whole thing! Crank up the sound, Great soundtrack. Highly recommended.",1476662400,3,1054,4.340101522842639

6904641,5,B00R8GUXPG,"FUN movie!!!  As irreverent as a Mel Brooks film like Blazing Saddles, married with some of the most spectacular sets, costumes, and CG environments you'll ever see.  The color pallets are insane, which isn't something one normally thinks about, but trust me, when you see this movie, you will be amazed if you pay attention to some of the backdrops, skintones (on the aliens), and just the entire setting for each scene.  The plots campy, and there's lots of 'literal' humor.  Add to all of that, the acting.  Acting... a lost art... and yet here it is.. ACTING!  When you consider two of the characters are completely CG.. you have to be amazed that the actors were able to 'act' when the character they're interacting with isn't even physically there.  Watch the bonus features and they do show a great bit about how they worked around that issue.  Anywhooo... I don't know if I've enjoyed a movie this much since I saw the original Star Wars back in.... what was it... 1978?  I forget.  Bottom line... if you like tongue-in-cheek humor married with a space-opera, this movie delivers.  LOVE IT!!!",1476576000,3,1100,4.7368421052631575

Andrews Blu-ray Review: GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY [2014] is a stunning awesome action packed film, that is filled with natural and artificial beauty that is a testament to modern filmmaking with seamless practical and equally stunning computer CGI visual effects that blend together to create a dazzling space adventure world. Its the best MARVEL Studios Blu-ray, it is visually flawless. Every crack in Groots bark, each line in Draxs tattooed body, and every hair on Rockets head stand out with perfection, totally blowing away any imitators, because GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY pristine transfer will blow it away. MARVEL Studios swaps gloomy superheroes for snappy, Saturday-cartoon fun. And it is a total gem.

GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is based on one of Marvel Comics lesser known franchises, this is the tale of Peter Quill [Chris Pratt], an earthling abducted as a boy who, a quarter of a century later, is working as a Han Solo-style outlaw-for-hire under the self-ordained nickname Star-Lord. When his quest for a mysterious orb attracts the attention of some blue-skinned intergalactic troublemakers, Quill throws in with a team of fellow outsiders including green-skinned warrior princess Gamora [Zoe Saldana], genetically enhanced raccoon Rocket [voiced by Bradley Cooper], comically literal man-mountain Drax [Dave Bautista] and a self-regenerating, semi-sentient walking tree named Groot [Vin Diesel] being his usual muscle man agenda.

Basic scenario is that you have a good vs. evil plot in here somewhere, but its rendered largely impenetrable by a profusion of MARVEL-verse asides which will only make sense to those who have followed the mythology across the entire comic and film franchise.  No matter of this space opera, the rest of us can just sit back and enjoy the ride, as the film ricochets from one dazzling, frazzling action set-piece to the next, pausing only to charm our socks off with another pithy retort, classic bubble-gum-pop hit or cutely random alien character.

GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY specialises in total adventure fun, served by the sugar-sprinkled ice-cream-scoop loaded in seeing this odd quintet bluster through space battles and alien brawls that would have defeated anyone smarter and better-equipped. Chris Pratt is a swaggering space adventurer, Peter Quill, and with the groups self-appointed leader, sets Guardians of the Galaxys tone from the start. Abducted from Earth as a boy in 1988 and raised by intergalactic mercenaries, he is a cocky, charismatic outlaw in the Han Solo mould and gets in and out of scrapes by means of bluster and bravado rather than especially quick wits. Peter Quills most treasured possessions is a battered, outlandishly out-of-place Walkman and a mixtape that preserves the pop songs of his beloved mothers youth, hence the presence of such cheesy, engagingly memorable numbers as Hooked on a Feeling and The Pina Colada Song on the soundtrack.

For reasons that is too complicated and confusing to go into here and  believe me it doesnt really matter, but Peter Quill winds up in a very run down space prison in the company of a bunch of bad-ass and wise-ass: green-skinned alien Gamora [Zo Saldana] who is no stranger to playing weirdly pigmented extra-terrestrials, and there is tattooed, slow-on-the-uptake hulk Drax the Destroyer [Dave Bautista], and a sarcastic talking raccoon named Rocket [Bradley Cooper] and his sidekick Groot [Vin Diesel], a walking tree whose vocabulary is limited to the three words I am Groot.

But with this ragtag bunch of misfits oddball crew bands together to retrieve an all-powerful orb and stop it falling into the hands of genocidal bad guy Ronan the Accuser [Lee Pace]. But in the meantime Peter Quill says, This orb has a real shiny blue suitcase, Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe what is it? and where upon Peter Quill gives us the wink that the plot is just a marvellous excuse for fizzing CGI-boosted action and larky, tongue-in-cheek bantering.

Some may find the films self-satisfaction attitude a mite grating, but I loved the whole film, as it is one great rollercoaster action packed film from start to finish. Chris Pratt is a very likeable character, but to some people he will be compared his character to Harrison Ford, which of course he is not, however hard he tries and there are some real moments where the sheer brain-melting relentlessness becomes slightly over powering, but again I loved it for its sheer adrenaline action pack adventure film, especially viewing it in the awesome 3D. But overall this is giddy, ridiculous fun filled, witty, wacky and wonderfully generous sugary gift of a space adventure film that was a total blast, but also with the added bonus of a brilliant music soundtrack. MARVEL fans like me, will love it! Finally, I loved at the very end of the credits where it states, No raccoons or tree creatures were harmed during the making of the film. Also watch right to the end of the film for a very nice surprise. One thing that slightly confused me is in wanting to know where Peter Quill was able to get extra batteries to keep his Walkman tape machine to be played. Of course when the film comes to an end, I started to feel very sad, as it was such an exciting rollercoaster action packed Sci-Fi film, but of course there was no need to feel sad, as at the end of the film we get informed that a new GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY 2 film is coming out in the very near future and so my fears have now subsided and I will be there ready when I can purchase the 3D Blu-ray disc when it is finally released.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  With the combination of MARVEL Studios and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings you GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY from a far off distant galaxy in a highly detailed and gorgeous 1080p ultimate encoded image and also with an equally impressive original theatrical 2.40:1 aspect ratio. This 3D Blu-ray presentation is Blu-ray high definition at its best. This Blu-ray also brings you a wide pallet of stunning colours and with lots of fantastic bright neon colours on everything from environments to starscapes to crazy alien skin tones and all of these are reproduced really wonderfully. The 3D film mixes a number of brightly lit exterior sequences with tons of shadowy space and interior worlds, rendering a visually engaging world in outer space that is never monotonous. Black levels are spot on too. Special Effects too are very highly detailed, with fully CGI characters that come to life in an almost photographic realistic way. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is one long ultimate show-stopper on this 3D Blu-ray disc that is totally perfect for the ultimate demonstrating to people who say they hate 3D Blu-ray discs.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  Again with this MARVEL Studios and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings you GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY in stunning 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. It also I can assure you that it definitely boasts very engaging ultimate reference quality audio surround experience. Dialogue is wonderfully clear, even in the kore chaotic action sequences in the film. Sound effects are aggressive in a brilliant way, especially with the laser blasts and space ships enveloping your home cinema surround sound environment that is deep and punching, accentuating thrusters and thudding explosions. Finally, for classic rock music fans are going to rejoice at how great and expansive all the music sounds that wrap around the listeners. If like me, you are also an audiophile with a high resolution audio system, you probably haven't heard this classic rock music songs sound this well before. Overall GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a fantastic 3D Blu-ray audio experience.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: As an added bonus, these special features can be viewed in 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.

Special Features: Featurettes: Here you get to view two separate features that are as follows:

01. Guide to the Galaxy with James Gunn [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [20:56] This particular feature starts off in a very confusing way, in making think you are about to start a video game, especially as it is titled GALACTIC ADVENTURER Featuring James Gunn. But despite this, here you get to view a decent string of behind-the-scenes vignettes that cover world building, makeup, and the Kiln prison sequence, including the sheer size of the set. They are strung together with a series of side-scrolling 8-bit video game segments, during which time Star-Lord [James Gunn] encounters animated avatars into several scenes from the film as he introduces himself to the characters. Contributors include James Gunn [Co-Writer/Director], Richard Roberts [Set Decorator], Chris Pratt [Peter Quill/Star-Lord], David White [Special Make-Up Effects Designer], Zoe Saldana [Gamora], Dave Bautista [Drax], Michael Rooker [Yondu], Charles Wood B.S.C. [Production Designer], Benicio Del Toro [The Collector], Victoria Alonso [Executive Producer], Lee Pace [Ronan] and Vin Diesel [Groot].

02. The Intergalactic Visual Effects for GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:11] Here with this feature we get an extra look behind-the-scenes of actors doing their voices for the characters in the film, plus the other actors talking about their part in the fil, as well as seeing how the CGI effects were done, especially focusing on bringing the digital characters to life, one gets a sense of how much work went on behind-the-scenes. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel shared their thoughts about their respective characters and the massive amount of work it took to bring those characters alive onscreen, courtesy of the visual effects team. The spot even mentions Oreo, the real raccoon that was used to help the team create Rockets movements and behaviour. Contributors included Vin Diesel [Groot], Chris Pratt [Peter Quill/Star-Lord], Victoria Alonso [Executive Producer] and James Gunn [Co-Writer/Director].

Special Feature: Exclusive Look at MARVEL's AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:16] This is a short promotional film looking at behind-the-scenes at the making of the next Avengers adventure film. The film was shot in New York, Italy, South Africa, and South Korea to give the story a much more global epic feel. Screenwriter and director Joss Whedon talks about the new characters coming to the MARVEL cinema universe near you. Not much more here than what we already know, but it is okay and definitely aimed at the MARVEL nerdy fans who will drool over it. Contributors include Kevin Feige p.g.a. [Producer], Joss Whedon [Screenwriter/Director], Jeremy Latcham [Executive Producer] and Elizabeth Olsen [Scarlet Witch].

Special Feature: Deleted and Extended Scenes [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:22] Here you have a selection of six different scenes, which are as follows: The Kyln will have to Do; Sisterly Love; No, I'm the Stupid One; Fake Laugh and Dancing Guard. These include a wonderful scene between Gamora and Nebula, and a prison guard dancing to Pilots 1974 song Magic. You have the option of playing all what you view with an audio commentary by James Gunn or without. Scenes work best when you have the audio commentary turned on.

Special Feature: Gag Reel [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:54] They say you will Experience Cosmic Shenanigans and Celestial Goofs with this so called hilarious Gag Reel, but overall it is just the usual in-joke bloopers they like to think MARVEL fans will be eager to watch. But I have to admit the last but one where the cast do this Dance Off, which to me is the funniest blooper scene of the lot I have seen in a very long time.

Audio Commentary with Director James Gunn: Here James Gunn introduces himself while watching GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. James Gunn gets really enthusiastic and engaging at times, and also delivers a very candid, and extensive scene-by-scene rundown of the entire film, delving into the script, style and tone, the process of casting the characters and the subsequent actors' performances, designing and realizing the worlds, technology and aliens on display, striking a balance between action, drama and comedy, integrating practical and computer-generated effects, and more. At the start of the film James talks about when we first introduced to the young Peter Quill and when doing the screenplay he wanted to focus on the SONY Walkman, as he felt it was a pivotal part of the plot of the film, and especially Peter Quills great attachment to his Mother, whose character reflects to the music on the mixed tape. When you see Peter Quill 26 year later, landing on the MORAG planet searching for the Orb with using the special hand unit we get a holographic image, and the dog we see is Jamess pet dog, which he named it Doctor Wesley Von Spears and why this name we never find out. But originally the dog was found roaming the streets of Carson City, California, and was taken in by the local dog shelter there when he was just a few months old. He was later on adopted by James Gunn. Doctor Wesley Von Spears is a mixed breed with large parts of Cocker Spaniel and Siberian Husky with a little bit of Greyhound thrown in. James Gunn talks very glowing about the British actor Christopher Fairbank who plays The Broker and really praises this actor and says that Christopher was very easy to work with, and felt he put in an amazing performance and wants to use Christopher in future Guardian films. When we see the Guardian group in the tower in the prison trying to escape, well James informs us that this huge set was built in the Pinewood Studio and consisted of 150,000 lbs of steel and after they finished shooting, they melted all the steel down and sold it off to get their money back and praises Charles Wood [Production Designer] who built the set with help from the Production Design Team. One thing I noticed throughout the audio commentary, that James Gunn keeps saying, this is my favourite moment in the film, which I do not really think he realises he says it and I surprised the people with his in the viewing room did not point this out. When you get near to the end of the film you see Drax and the Baby Groot, when you see it dancing, that is in fact James Gunn dancing and was captured via computer motion reference CGI and comments that is how he does his sweet dance floor moves and also his unique dance style, so watch out John Travolta, James has got you covered. Anyway, more importantly, James Gunn addresses the more curious choices he made in the making of the film, and fills in a few blanks, and answers questions posed by the fan community, and generally enriches the experience with extra layers of detail and backstory. All in all it is a totally enjoyable, engaging brilliant directors audio commentary that never ever gets boring. Definitely gets a 5 star rating from me.

Blu-ray and Digital HD Trailer [2014] [1080p] [2.40:1] [1:30] Here you get to view the Original Trailer for CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER. This is slightly different from the Original Theatrical Trailer.

Finally, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY in 3D is an absolute blast and comes as a breath of fresh air for this type of Sci-Fi film that blends space opera action with the 1970s and 1980s Americana pop culture, making the whole thing feel fresh and proving once again, MARVEL is not yet done defining the Super Hero Genre. As for this Blu-ray, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY boasts a reference quality 3D presentation that is definitely on the short list as one of the best 3D visual experience ever, as well as the equally high quality 2D Blu-ray disc presentation, plus of course it has the fantastic 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround audio experience, and a nice collection of bonus materials, which rounds off this nice little Blu-ray package. But of course if you love 3D then this edition represents the best value in your 3D visual experience ever, which is totally enhanced with an amazing visual experience that is really exciting. But of course if you are not a great fan of 3D, then of course you have the choice of viewing the 2D Blu-ray disc for your visual enjoyment. Very Highly Recommended!

I don't know what magic happened since 2000 but no Marvel, ABC series or Netflix seasons have been by FAR the best watching I can remember. I was a comic book junkie as a kid growing up and would walk two miles to comic store every Friday to buy one or two and a snack during early to mid 80s and though I'm 44 now,  I feel elated watching them all over again. Seriously, Thank you Marvel Entertainment,  Disney and ABC for staying true to form.

I am 3/4s of the way thru it so you might think I've gotten the gist, but nope. Suddenly Glenn Close has another extravagant hair-do and they are battling in sunny skies (despite being in deep space all this time) AND what airship...

6904827,5,B00R8GUXPG,"It's a great movie, it has everything. The flow is great. The story is great. The characters are great. Visuals are really really good. Nothing seemed forced or awkward. They certainly weren't going just for our money, they went for our hearts too. Guess what, it worked! Brilliant movie and can't wait to see this cast again behind the screen.",1473379200,,344,4.75
6904828,5,B00R8GUXPG,Loved this movie. Funny and great special effects,1473379200,,49,5.25
6904829,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Chris Pratt Pratt is coolest kid in school. Zoe Saldana is one of Americas greatest actors.  Dave Baptista went from wrestling to a career making role. Fine work.
I haven't loved a film this much in a long time. Good job James Gunn. You are up there with Spielberg in my book.",1473379200,,276,4.3076923076923075
6904830,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This is so much fun. Chris Pratt is perfect for the lead role. He is goofy and fun. In the beginning of the show it seems to be a little clunky with the writer trying to mesh the different characters personalities together. But, it did finally come together nicely. Of course my favorite character is Groot. (The tree) (Vin Diesel) and Zoe Saldana is great.

This band of misfits come together to save the Galaxy in which they do.  Each character is terribly flawed (In which I love). In the movie each character shows their strengths, but also they vulnerabilities.

It's a lot of fun to watch.",1473379200,2,595,4.542056074766355

6904833,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This is a really fun movie.  It's humorous without being stupid.  It is an origin story for a team, so it's hard to go in depth with any one of characters, but I'm excited to see where they take this in the future.  The soundtrack is great, and works as a plot device as well, which was pretty cool.

If sad stuff bothers you, then watch out for the first 10 minutes or so which explains how a little Earth kid ended up in space, but it's nothing shocking.",1473292800,,456,4.089887640449438

Some of the characters were potentially intriguing, but we learned very little about them.  There was almost laughable overuse of obvious humans painted a different color just to make them look alien. There were some humorous bits and good action and effects. But it didn't measure up to the Avengers. Iron Man or Captain America series, for example. It was OK, not great, for a comic book movie.  I'll stick to Star Trek and SYFY. .",1471651200,,543,4.827956989247312

I hadn't thought I would like it when it came out and I watched the trailer but I was so wrong!  What an entertaining movie this was!

I might have enjoyed it better if the movie had less bad language for the sake of being 'true to the 80s' feel. Or was it 70s? I'm confused. I felt like the writing was on par with a Karate Kid or Footloose but had modern animation and sci-fi elements, sorta. I think this should have been released 20 years ago.",1471392000,3,386,4.092105263157895

6904952,2,B00R8GUXPG,"There are some fun and intriguing elements to this movie, but there is so much swearing and inappropriate humor that really has no bearing on the movie and does not add a thing to the story line.  That really takes away from what could have been a good movie.  I and my family hope when they come out with the sequels they leave out the potty humor and swearing, and leave in a good story line and action/adventure.  We have purchased many of the super hero movies, but this one will not be in our movie collection because of this.",1471305600,,531,4.29

6904954,1,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie is propaganda and it stinks. Oh no, the terrorist want to wipe us off the face of the earth, we are the only ones who should be in possession of the most powerful weapon in the universe. I go to a movie to see fiction and forget about reality, not to be blatantly brainwashed with a one-sided political agenda. There's also some kind of weird slavery angle where Chris Pratt is abused and called boy all the time by his southern talking surrogate dad or whatever through the movie. I don't know, the movie stinks. Write an actual movie, don't make some kind of bizzaro political opinion. Maybe you can throw some religious opinions in there too to make it stink even more in your sequel.

If you want to make a real movie, look to something like Star Trek or maybe Star Wars. There might be propaganda in there somewhere but it's not as blatantly obvious.

The script is bad, the acting is bad, there are moments of inappropriate humor that doesn't fit. The music is all 70's music or whatever, and it eventually gets annoying and doesn't fit to match old music to a slow or romantic moments based on the lyrics alone. It also makes the DVD menu profoundly annoying.",1471219200,,1177,4.469767441860465

6905221,3,B00R8GUXPG,"The movie was an easy 5 stars, but my reasons for a low rating was due to the lack of sound quality that the streaming format presented. We bought and streamed this from the Amazon On Demand video app installed on a 1st generation PS3  (arguably the best of this platforms consoles) HDMI connected to a Yamaha RX-V477 receiver with NS-SP1800 Yamaha 5.1 600 W Home Audio Speaker System with 2 identical subwoofers. Apple streamed movies, DVD's CD's and blu ray's typically sing through our budget setup. The Amazon format sound though was disapointingly muddy at best with very little detail. Loved the movie! Not at all impressed with streaming it ever again through our theatre system with Amazon's app. I'm grabbing the Marvel collection on blu ray so Amazon of course still has a customer but never buying another digital version of anything you all sell until this gets better.

6905303,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Thirty-seven years is all it took for someone to unlock the secret of the success of Star Wars, and it turns out to be with characters that are older than George Lucas original saga.

Guardians of the Galaxy is this generations Star Wars, and director James Gunn deserves the credit for this films success

Credit deserves to be praised on many for this films success, as director James Gunn has truly produced a movie that should do for this generation what Star Wars did for his generation.

Searching for one word that sums up Marvels latest entry into its Cinematic Universe, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY can be best described as fun.

While another example that comes to mind is this generations Star Wars as Guardians reveals the crazy time that was Cosmic Marvel in the 1970s to pretty much a brand-new audience.

Director James Gunn does exactly what George Lucas did in 1977, introducing audiences to a world of new characters that make up a vast and storied universe; and just like Star Wars, the secret weapon of Guardians, is the human element of individuals overcoming large odds to do the right thing.

Gunn and Perlman ground the story on Earth and Gunn is very clever is his use of music, making it a character in the film, allowing non-fans to relate to the character of Peter Quill through the songs of the 1970s and 80s. When Quill first appears on screen as Star Lord, he does so in true Indiana Jones fashion, but while listening to a SONY walkman and a cassette mixtape (or known to todays younger generation as a playlist, but made with a lot more thought and care).

Breathing life into their characters is no easy feat, especially during an origin story

All the main actors did a tremendous job breathing life into their characters and the script was fast paced and organic, allowing a natural origin story for this team that begins with the characters (and audience) not knowing one another.

The breakout stars are Rocket and Groot, and praise should be heavily heaped upon Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel for their voicing of both characters, as well as  Gunn and screenwriter Nicole Perlman. In addition to the above, recognition should also be bestowed to the CGI teams that brought both characters to life on film, as never once did they seem out of place. The hair alone (especially in IMAX 3D) on Rocket is a true masterpiece, as are Groots expression of emotions through his facial expressions.

New races are easily introduced into this film given its galactic landscape, and Guardians is loaded with Easter Eggs, which not only celebrate Marvel Comics rich library of characters and stories, but opens a larger door to its Universe (and continuing to pay off a promise made in the post-credit scene to Avengers). Be careful, as you just might miss something, especially in scenes with the Collector.

While Han Solo and Indiana Jones are both terrific characters to compare to Chris Pratts Quill, Joss Whedons Malcom Reynolds might actually be his brother (I kept waiting for Serenity to flash across the sky a few times).

Guardians was viewed by many as a huge risk when it was announced due to the fact that even most comic fans had an unfamiliarity with the characters. Based on Dan Abnett and Andy Lannings run, and in a stroke of brilliance by Marvel, a new Guardians of the Galaxy monthly comic series was launched upon the films announcement, guest starring the Avengers and written by master-scribe Brian Michael Bendis. The on-screen team consists of these characters, although they have known each other a lot longer than their film counterparts.

Fun is the keyword to this cinematic opera, and fans should have as much fun as the characters do (Quill jamming to a song while searching for an ancient artifact or Rocket enjoying people watching as he looks for his next score, to name just a few).",1467676800,,3839,4.753383458646616
6905304,5,B00R8GUXPG,Marvel is awesome in general and we have enjoyed watching the comics brought to the modern world with great movies.  This one was also awesome.  The humor is great and there are so many wonderful one liners that we were laughing through most of the movie.  Yet the film makers and actors manage to make you connect with these odd characters and feel pain when they feel pain - that is talent.  A must see film over and over.,1467676800,,424,4.329113924050633

I think that the switch to a less serious manner in the show greatly improved it as a whole, (sometimes the other Marvel movies add up to a bit too much 'serious').

6905613,5,B00R8GUXPG,"No spoiler review here. First, this is not a movie aimed at children. This is a worthy member of the Marvel Univese and it is funny, Witty, and has moments of high level action, as does the rest of the charter members of the Marvel series. The 3d looks great. not much on dodging bullets and flying debris, but more set to allow the 3d viewer to be deeply emerged into the particular scene at any given point of the movie. Immensely satisfying. If Avatar sets the 3D bar, this is just below that, but still remains very high on my list of great 3D movies. Highly recommend this movie, along this it's music soundtrack (you need to see the movie to catch my meaning).
For fans of 3D movies, please take a minute and email manufactures, (Samsung, Sony, LG, etc) and let them know terminating this technology is ill advised. No 2016 TVs have 3D capabilities and this is an entertainment setback. 4K is not that much better than a good upscaling BD player and a good SUHD TV, all available now and no reason the abandon 3D. Please jump in and add your support.",1465257600,,1056,4.392857142857143

6905727,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Totally over this film and I am looking forward to the next journey. The story was extremely engaging, the actors were terrific and each person was completely right for his/her role. The biggest surprise to me was how very nasty Lee Pace was as the villain. He was scary in the strong performance that he gave as a being dedicated to revenge, no matter the cost to himself. His intensity was as powerful and insane as Khan's in ""The Wrath of . . . . .""

Not having been aware of Chris Pratt prior to this film, I have no knowledge of his previous work and can only imagine that he has done well. As the Star Lord, I am looking forward to his next chapter as leader of this ragtag group of friends. Can't say that I have a favorite because each one is terrific.",1464134400,,760,4.205479452054795

And after watching it multiple times, I have found something new to increase my entertainment in the movie with each screening.  I especially like the interaction of the cast, be they real living beings or CG like Rocket and Groot.  Adversarial at first, they soon work together for a common goal. We begin rooting for them to successfully obtain the orb and defeat the bad guys, of which there are several.  Watching carefully, there are many funny lines that add comedy to the action film.

6905935,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Awesome movie! Does it match the comics exactly? No way; but that doesn't make this movie any less epic. The writer's and directors did a great job incorporating some seriously moving emotional segments into the mix from the start; yet this is by no means a tear-jerker that makes you pity the main character. The transition from emotional back story to action packed present is simultaneously fun and exciting as Guardians of the Galaxy shows you its true colors right off the bat. A fantastic blend of almost believable sic-fi tech, smart-assed-sharp-tongued wicked humor and a cast of ""just missed the classic hero mark"" characters keeps the movie funny, fresh and riveting to the end. It is rare to find a movie with a ""replay value"" but, in my opinion, this is definitely one of them.",1462492800,,789,4.8088235294117645

Turns out the space junk is an infinity stone - a source of unlimited power, but dangerous to mortal life.  Comical tale of thieves stealing the prize from thieves - getting thrown in the space slam, and with the help of Rocket - a raccoon like lifeform - they escape jail, have a dance off with the big bad guy, and by banding together as a team - conquering the day.

Not just with the special effects or the awesome makeup or the over the top fight scenes.  I was impressed with the humor and the likability of the characters, especially  ""Star Lord"".  This is truly a film that had me on the edge of my seat during the action scenes, laughing out loud at other times and even shedding a tear or two.

Out of all the Marvel films I've seen so far this is my favorite.  I believe I heard they are planning more movies for these characters and I hope I heard right.",1460592000,,621,4.125
6906250,5,B00R8GUXPG,"One of the best Marvel movies in years. Lots of action, humor, drama, action....oh wait, I said that. The surprise hit of the year for 2014. Glad I caught this movie in the theater. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, and Vin Diesel line up the main cast of this movie. They all hit their marks as the characters that are comic book characters. Not very well known is Guardians of the Galaxy, but after you see this movie you may just want to get caught up in the comics and make this movie a collection to your blu ray or dvd library.",1460505600,,556,4.304761904761905

6906255,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Honestly! This movie should not work! Its a space movie that has a talking tree and a raccoon with a huge gun and anger issues all set to a soundtrack of songs from the 70's-80's and starring the funny guy from Parks and Recreation and it is awesome!
Honestly how does Marvel do it?
Chris Pratt has become one of my favorite actors mainly because of his work in this movie and Jurassic World. From the very beginning of the film you can tell that this movie won't be like any other Superhero movie. The first time you see Chris Pratt he is looking for an item, kind of like a sci-fi Indianna Jones and he is going through this ancient temple dodging space rats and jumping chasms all while singing and dancing along to Come and Get Your Love. What?!
If that doesn't get your attention than I don't know what else I could say without giving spoilers.
In closing I guess I just want to say that out of all the Marvel movies made so far this one is by far my favorite as far as comedy goes, I had my in laws watch this with me after we saw the disappointing Batman v superman movie and they couldn't stop laughing and agreed that this is one of Marvels Best.
Definitely worth watching even if your hesitant.",1460246400,,1204,4.262008733624454

This can best be described as a romp...funny, sarcastic, filled with action and great CGI effects.  There are plenty of uncredited appearances and a connecting story line that travels through all the Marvel movies.  Featuring the voices of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper and the visible acting of Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana, this is one of the more enjoyable Marvel offerings. There's mass destruction and explosions on a grand scale but somehow, it doesn't have the angst and threat of say...The Winter Soldier...and the music helps, too.

6906302,5,B00R8GUXPG,I liked this movie. It was good. There is a raccoon in it. It can talk. I don't remember his name but he can talk. He has opposable thumbs but he doesn't wear shoes. If he wore shoes he would be able to tie them because he has those thumbs. In the movie he gets money for turning people in to the authorities. He buys a gun and a leather jacket but he doesn't buy any shoes. If I had a job like that I would get some neat shoes. I think he may be on drugs because people who are on drugs buy leather jackets and guns but they don't wear shoes very much. Maybe their feet get hot? Maybe he just can't make up his mind about what kind of shoes he wants to buy? I don't know. When I was on drugs my feet never got hot and I wore shoes all the time. I have a lot of shoes. If he needs shoes I will give him some of mine until he gets off of the drugs or make up his mind. He doesn't need to be walking around everywhere in space with no shoes. It's dangerous. He might step on a space nail. He would be in trouble because there aren't many hospitals in space.,1459209600,,1055,3.8

That being said, it's a great story of a bunch of damaged self-interested misfits that end up having to rely on each other due to circumstance and discovering they are better together then by themselves. And a bonus, Lee Pace (King Thranduil from the Hobbit) plays Ronin, the bad guy. Good acting, hilarious moments and a crowd pleaser.",1459209600,,535,4.583333333333333

But, had to watch this because it is part of the Marvel Universe, right?  What a surprise!  It was just fantastic.  Not only was Chris Pratt wonderful, but all the characters were. Even the animated ones.  I've watched it several times now, and will be watching it again...maybe now.",1458000000,,441,4.304878048780488

I never read the original comic, but it has the feel of a classic Marvel universe story.... something definitely from my 70s childhood. Nice that it comes with bonus features about production and deleted scenes. Another 30 min of interesting content. I hope Hollywood will produce more films in this genre.",1458000000,,392,5.140625

6906465,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Went into it with little or no prior knowledge of the comic or how closely the film would follow it or portray its characters.  Maybe the best comic book adaption movie since that genre took off.  Thankfully it did not take itself too seriously since, after all, it's based on a comic book.  I did not take it too seriously since I, after all, had not opened the comic book.  Have a couple beers and enjoy.",1457740800,,406,4.302631578947368

6906517,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Guardians of the Galaxy is one of those wonderful, sit back and have a good time movies. Based on Marvel Comics, the movie was what one would expect from such a genre, with lots of action, good humor, good acting, great special effects, and background music. It was so good at the movies that I bought the DVD to watch over and over again at home when the mood hits me. If you're expecting a serious ""Gone With the Wind"" then obviously, this movie is not for you. It's not as ""serious"" as the ""Avengers"" series of movies, as this is played tongue in cheek (where else would you get a talking raccoon or a talking tree) and lots of fun for the young at heart, and purveyors of this genre. Went to the movies with ""da boys in the band,"" and we all laughed and loved it, and watched it again over the bass player's house when I bought the DVD and we had just as much fun. The DVD lacks the extras like ""the making of"" which I missed, but otherwise, lots of fun to watch on a shut in wintry day or whenever the mood hits you.

6906733,4,B00R8GUXPG,"It uses about a hundred cliches in the Sci fi genre and is absurdly over the top and in the best of ways. These characters, while familiar, are written to be entertaining and like able and the plot is little more than an excuse to facilitate their journey together. Colorful, vibrant and insanely passionate it earns the reputation of being what is basically the second true Avengers movie in a sense of spirit. Fun for kids and adults the action is creative and the adventure is stupendous because the movie knows what to take not take seriously (the plot, the science, even the villian to some extent) and what to take seriously(the humor, the emotions, the themes of belonging). Each of the five characters as worth rooting for and you want to see them make it through. The best characters by far are Groot, some space tree that speaks like a Pokemon with the kind sincerity of a saint and a raccoon that can talk and wield a machine gun. That's all you need to love this film",1454025600,2,979,4.50561797752809

6906978,3,B00R8GUXPG,"I was not familiar with the movie nor characters prior to viewing it.  As such, I was a bit disappointed in what I saw for a variety of reasons.  The biggest reason was due to the fact the set up of the story was very confusing.  A lot of characters were introduced and it was hard for me to catch both their names and their relationships to one and other.  The other issue was that a lot of the acting seemed contrived in an effort to inject a bit of humor and this sort of failed in my opinion.  That said, I thought the Raccoon character was pretty good.  Third, the ending did not seem plausible and was only established to be set up for a sequel.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed the film more so had I known both the storyline and characters going in.  Alas, such was not the case.

All in all, I did not feel that I wasted my time watching the movie.  It just wasn't as good as touted.",1449100800,3,889,4.057471264367816

6907003,4,B00R8GUXPG,"I never heard of these guys until I saw the trailers for this movie. In certain ways it reminded me of JUPITER ASCENDING but it took some time  I
to figure  out who was the baddies and who where the  goodies!  Lots and lots of eye candy though unfortunately now cute babe as in JUPITER.
I did like the Tree Man and the Raccoon Man.  Of course there was the Darth Vader evil genius villain that they had to contend with.  Again, the
special effects were spectacular, the acting ok, and there was this blue skinned gal who our hero liked, but she was no hottie, except perhaps
for Captain Kirk.  Anyhow they have all sorts of adventures and save the Galaxy at the end and become the new super Heroes (and Heroines)
This is a fun movie to watch with humor added to boot.  I do not know how this thing did in the theater, so though the producers leave open the
possibility of a sequal.....who knows?  I did not watch this in the theater, but bought the DVD from Amazon.  But I watched on HBO.  Not a serious
film by anymeans but fun to watch the baddies in the end get their comeuppance! FOUR STARS.  Enjoy!",1448841600,,1103,4.25

What I don't like is that the latest Marvel movies don't come with Ultraviolet versions.  If they come with digital copies at all you have to have them on the Disney Anywhere server.  I don't need yet another digital account to access my digital versions.  A real drag.  I could buy an Amazon digital version but that just drives the cost of the movie up beyond my budget.  Disney is just too greedy for me.

That said, I think the movie is a quality product and the performances were first rate.  If you're a fan of the MCU then I think you should see this one.",1448668800,,718,4.107913669064748

I've read some of the ""1 Star"" comments and obviously this movie is not for everyone.

6907184,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I would describe it as better than the Avengers, and by far one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever watched.  It is an action packed movie with a lot of comedy in it, and even better effects than the Avengers.  The story is logical, and rather than just having a basic villain or hero, they are complex.  You can see how the bad guy is bad, but you also learn that his father, and his grandfather and countless others died in the war against Nova, and he wants revenge.  So you see the evil in his actions, but also need to respect that he is doing what he thinks is right, whether or not he is wrong is depending on your position.  He is a true Avenger, in the way that the Avengers movies were never really Avengers.  While the Heros are wildly varying, with none of them being your classic hero.  Certainly none are as boring as Captain America.  Pratt does a great job portraying Star Lord and the movie was an extremely enjoyable experience.  I'd suggest conservative parents prevent children under 10 yrs from watching it, as it does have a lot of inappropriate yet funny moments.  I watched this in theaters, day one showing, loved it, bought it the moment went on sale.  There are parts for everyone, the dramatic and awesome hero fight sequences, and the more emotional scenes of sacrifice, and the many, many hilarious moments.  All in all it has good effects, great story, and diverse characters.",1446854400,,1412,4.4941176470588236

I know how many of you enjoyed this, but I am definitely not the audience for it.

The film is better than I expected from the trailer, but even with lowered expectations this film is a big meh. The humor falls flat, the music sucks, the characters uninteresting (best one is the tattooed strong guy, but even then he's not that charismatic and the basis for his humor is literally at Small Wonder level,) the tree man is a one joke character (?), the raccoon could easily have been Danny DeVito in Hercules. The insults are brainless (calling the raccoon a rodent is simply irritating, I know it happens in real life: remember the 'Squish the Fish 'campaign against The Dolphins? Well, that was irritating as well.)

The conflicts are all resolved by an unexplained magical power one of the character happens to have, there is no danger and nothing is at stake: Ships are falling into a city and that is resolved by exploding them (huh?) A larger ship falls, but not to worry, we are told that the city has been evacuated, but even seconds after the craft crashes, hundreds of people come out from underneath it! What happened to the evacuation? All characters are indestructible, a failing in many of these marvel movies, one character is dying and is fixed by punching a needle into him, the tree man dies - or we are told he is gonna die - only to be reborn immediately after... What is the point?

The visuals are only slightly better than in Green Lantern, by basically going primary instead of purple/green, and the whole thing felt like a flashback to The Fifth Element, except way more CG looking.

I didn't hate it, but it did not do anything for me. In fact I watched it immediately before Tucker & Dale vs. Evil a film I enjoyed immensely more and would highly recommend to anyone here.

But if this is your thing, go for it.",1446681600,2,1869,4.514792899408284

6907271,4,B00R8GUXPG,"I read the 1 and 2 star reviews, and i honestly do not think they understood the movie. Its a scifi action comedy with a heart. Its about need and tolerance slowly transforming into friendship and finally love. A disparate group of losers fit together to form first a fighting force then a family. One of them is a mysterious treelike being who adds magic, wonder, a touch of nature and beauty . The rest have appeared in scifi before but not with this much charm. I do think it could have edited more, but even occasional slowness did not pull me out of the movie. When it was over, i wanted the sequel immediately. So i watched it again, and enjoyed it more the second time. Since then i have watched it 2 more times and am still not bored. Can't wait for Guardians 2!",1445299200,15,770,4.280821917808219

6907305,2,B00R8GUXPG,"First of all, let me state that I collected comic books from the 70s through the early 2000's.  I do not collect them anymore, so my problem with the movie starts with the characters not being what I remembered from my comic book readings.  I was a fan of Star-Lord, Gamora and Drax, but they were not what I remembered or expected and I didn't like the changes.  Groot?  Didn't like it.  Rocket?  Comic relief that was the best character in the movie.

I was afraid of the hype before seeing the movie and really wanted to like it, but I didn't.  To me, the humor was forced and generally not funny.  I REALLY didn't like Yondu (which, to me, was Merle from the Walking Dead with a blue face) or the Nova Corps (and I was a BIG Nova fan in the 70's and 90's from his comic and the New Warriors comic).  I'm really tired of heroes being changed from who they are in the comics to sarcastic, self-centered idiots (Green Lantern) who always end up being heroic by the movie's end.  It's the same old formula and I just didn't like it.

After seeing the movie in the theater, I would have given this movie 1 star, but after buying it to keep my Marvel movie universe intact, I liked it better after watching it a few more times, but not as much as most people seem to.  I still don't understand the love fest for this movie as I consider it the weakest of all of the Marvel movies (with Captain America: The Winter Soldier being my favorite) and generally not that good.

How could it have been better?  With a smarter Drax, a more dangerous and cold Gamara (she is an assassin after all), a less snarky Star-Lord and Richard Rider, Nova in the movie and no Groot (sorry, he was just too boring and one dimensional to me).  Anyway, this is MY opinion and you don't have to like it or agree with it.  If you liked comics in the 70's, 80's and 90's, you might not like the character depictions here or might not recognize the characters who you might have liked as they are totally different in this movie.  I would rather have seen a movie with Adam Warlock, Gamora, Thanos and the Magus instead with Jim Starlin writing it.  THAT would have been awesome!",1444694400,,2151,4.292803970223325

The film is funny, dramatic, and action-packed, all balancing out over a fun story with heartstring-pulling capabilities. It is well worth the watch, and purchase if you're looking to collect all the MCU films, but are unsure if you should spend money on it (depending on if it's good or bad) - it's seriously good.",1443916800,,675,4.586776859504132

6907386,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I honestly wasn't prepared to like it, but it doesn't get much better for opening sequences than our introduction to adult Quill. Maybe not a film for ""serious"" moviegoers who want to nitpick every little thing, but no matter how many times I watch this, it just makes me smile. It's just a fun movie with an unexpected soundtrack - which some have criticized - but I find to be a great addition to the character and feel to the film.",1443225600,,434,4.37037037037037

Then I had to get the Peter Quill Trench coat and Mask at the Disney store for my 5 year old which he instantly wore from the register to the car throughout the whole mall and mind you it was still August.  Great Movie.  Great Story.  Great Script.  Great Actors.  And finally Great Soundtrack.

The story of two souls that made a promise of a union, all others thought to be unbelievable and outlandish.  The joining was to be represented by an amethyst a clear symbol of the depth of feelings found in our couple.  Others desperately try to halt this pairing by stealing this precious rock even pawning it off to a Latin gangster.  Unfortunately obsession gets the better of one of our lovers thinking the symbol to be of greater import than the actual companionship.  Obsession then turns to hate and a rift grows allowing others to spirit the stone away and in the process one of our beloved, he who was consumed with this stone, died.  The survivor bravely decides to continue living but we see the tell tale signs of madness that destroyed his partner.",1442361600,,842,4.617449664429531

I first saw the trailer at D23 in 2013 and I heard people around me mumble ""I'm not sure about the raccoon"", but I was only intrigued.  I had a feeling it was going to be something different and special, and it is.  Every character is fleshed out, even Groot, who only ever says ""I am Groot"".  The action only furthers the storyline and is believeable and fun.  I'm really tired of big battle scenes, but this breaks it up into interesting scenes and I do not get bored.  Chris Pratt is now one of my favorite actors and his wit makes this movie one that you can watch over and over again.  I love this movie and I cannot wait for the sequel.

6907492,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Holy crap this was amazing!

I never liked the comic book. It was such a cheap and obvious attempt to cash in on the Star Wars craze. If Marvel could make me like a movie based on this property, there is almost nothing they can't do...

... Except maybe produce more than two compelling villains. Ronan is sometimes a good guy, sometimes a bad guy, because he puts patriotism ahead of every other consideration. It should have been possible to make him a compelling and sympathetic villain (while offering political commentary on the misuse of patriotism in the real world), but instead they turned him into just another mustache-twirler.

Fortunately the rest of the movie rocks. It's far more quirky and funny than any other Marvel movie. Rocket and Groot practically stole the movie, although everyone else was also amazing.

I didn't mind most of the changes to the characters because like I said, I didn't care for the source material. Drax is still revenge-crazed, but funnier and oddly charming. Quill is more of a goofball and he's better for it. I love the decision to portray Yondu as an unhinged redneck.

One more complaint, though. Gamorra DOES NOT LOSE FISTFIGHTS. I don't care what the plot needs.

The disk has plenty of additional goodies that are worth watching. I'm no expert on Blu-Ray transfer quality, but it looked and sounded great to me.",1441411200,,1362,4.799145299145299

While she was visiting this Summer we spent an evening eating popped corn and watching this movie, she loved it. Like me she thought the sound track was over the top and the story line kept her attention span throughout. I decided to surprise her by purchasing a copy and had it sent to her home. My sister informed me that the package arrived 2 days later ( thanks to PRIME) and that my niece was so excited to receive the DVD.

6907560,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I didn't know anything about these characters aside from a quick cameo they made in the animated Avengers TV series.  Knowing that there was a talking raccoon in the movie, I was aware of how easily this could go badly.  When I finally saw it on opening day, my fears were put to rest and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  So much so, I saw it again in an Atmos screening the next day and have seen the film in theaters ten times, beating out the old record holders of Lord Of The Rings and Star Wars, which were 6 and 5 times respectively.

The movie was shot in 2D, with the stereoscopic effect done in post, which never looks as good as real 3D, and sure enough, the flaws of that process were distracting; stars at wrong depths, feet not where they should be, weird ripples around moving objects, and the worst offenders were reflections that look like they're painted on.

So, why did I get the 3D version?  Well, since the studio wanted to get people to pay more for the 3D versions and the realized the 3D part alone wasn't enough, they decided to load it up with extras that the 2D version doesn't have.  One of those is the changing aspect ratio that the IMAX version had, which, again, was only available to the 3D version of the film.  So, I sprung for the 3D version here to get those larger screen filling shots, which I could watch in 2D by simply turning off the 3D feature on my TV. That leaves me with the original 2D image, which doesn't have any of the 3D flaws.

This was also my calibration disc since the image contains so much detail and color.  I had my TV calibrated professionally earlier this year and this was the first disc I played on that TV.  Even though the TV was pretty close to optimal out of the box, an hour of calibration really brought out the details, and I recommend it to anyone that is serious about their home theater.

I just watched this a couple more times this week, and I'm looking forward to the next movie.

As I mentioned, this is one of my calibration discs now, due to the high quality image and the full range of colors.  Surround sound is quite full as well, probably a result of the original ATMOS mix.  If this gets re-released with an ATMOS audio track, I may just have to upgrade my sound system for it.

If your system is not 3D capable, or you just aren't interested in the aspect changing, then stick with the 2D version; the 3D really didn't do anything for this movie, as it wasn't shot for 3D.",1440460800,,2459,4.278617710583154

Predictable?  Of course, good guys/gals win, bad guys/gals lose.  That's not the point though, it's how you get there and did you enjoy the journey.

Realistic/Possible?  Ppfff... it's a comic book movie!  Refer to line 1 above.

If you want to watch a movie that challenges you, filled with plot twists and turns, acted out by amazing award winning performances... don't go here.  You won't be happy.

If you enjoy a little escapism, having a few laughs, rooting for the protagonists that you already know will win and just enjoy some screen time... this movie may be just what you are looking for.

I mean a raccoon (if that's what it is) as hero... a band of misfits that you find revolting but kind of identify with?

Who makes this kind of movie? Marvel, I guess, and I loved it. The action is awesome, the humor is just intelligent enough to make you feel valued as a viewer, and - in the end - you just can't wait for these guys to seriously throw an Avenger's movie off kilter just when you need it most.",1439856000,,642,4.05511811023622

The actors actually sell us on their greed and recklessness, their rage, their loss and how they find loyalty and honor.

With that said I think they got it perfect, the feel of the two generated toons were great and fit right in with the painted practical characters they were along side with. I have watched it several times since I got it and the movie holds up, still funny and the action scenes are fun to watch again. I might not suggest it if you have found all the comic movies to be not for you but if that isn't you and you like sci-fi even then you will likely enjoy this as much as I have.",1439424000,,681,4.014705882352941

6907672,4,B00R8GUXPG,"When I first heard they were making a movie about the Guardians of the Galaxy, I had extremely low expectations. The Guardians are not exactly A-list Marvel characters. Not even B-List. Very obscure D-list heroes from the 1980s. The only one of the group I had even heard of was Rocket Raccoon. I therefore immediately dismissed the title as pure desperation on Marvel's part, to dig down so deep for new material.
I ignored the movie during its theatrical run. I gave it one week, two at most before oblivion. I was amazed when the movie stayed on and on and on.
Then after it finally closed I never gave it another thought.
On a whim I recently decided to rent it. I figured, if it sucks as bad as I think it will, I will only be out three bucks. I was very pleasantly surprised; decent acting for a superhero flick, and incredible effects. The two scene stealers are of course Rocket and Groot, the most unlikely team ever.
I was also surprised to see old Jack Kirby characters like Ronan the Accuser and Thanos in the movie. The only thing I disliked was the casting of ""Yondu"". I don't dislike the actor, but for me he will be forever typecast as Merle Dixon from the Walking Dead. And this was basically Merle Dixon in blueface. Overall though, I enjoyed the movie, and even ended up buying it. Looking forward to the sequel (s)..",1439078400,,1336,4.457142857142857

6907679,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Marvel films has made me rethink the way I look at superheroes and comic books. Science Fiction is my favorite genre, but I've never been a fan of superheroes, and in fact, ten years ago I would never have even considered seeing a film like Guardians of The Galaxy. On the surface, this looks like a kids movie, but thanks to some fantastic writing and Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), as interesting a character as you will ever meet, Guardians of The Galaxy is Science Fiction at it's best. Quill is a thief, nothing more, nothing less. He is hired to steal something and does it the same way he's done hundreds of times before, only this time, there are a bunch of other people trying to take it from him. Quill will come to learn that the item is so very valuable because it is a nearly unstoppable weapon, that the worst men in the universe will stop at nothing to possess. Together with the other renegades, Quill decides the best thing to do is to stop these men and make sure the item is never able to be taken again. Chris Pratt stars and gives the performance of a lifetime. I remember first seeing Pratt in the show Everwood, and thinking that this guy has no personality, amazing how things have changed. Finally able to be himself, Pratt shows that his personality is larger than life itself, and twice now in his young career, he has turned that gift into two of the best characters I've seen in years. Paired with some of Hollywood's brightest young stars, an incredible team of writers, and special effects that are out of this world, Guardians of The Galaxy had all the tools it needed to become the companies biggest earner. This is a film that a lot of people are never going to think of as anything more than a comic book turned into a film for children, but it is so much more than that. From the music to the storyline, to the stars themselves, this film has something for everyone, it was my top film pick of 2014, a must see movie, and something that any true fan of cinema shouldn't miss.",1438992000,,2007,4.397849462365591

6907682,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Great film, probably my favorite Marvel movie yet.  Dont get me wrong, Iron Man, Capt America, The Avengers are all good; but what sets this one apart in my opinion is that it doesnt have the traditional super hero themes that those others do.  Unless you really were into comic books, you probably never heard of the GoG.  Contrast that to the others, almost everyone has heard of them even if you weren't into comic books.

6907773,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Just when you were thinking you might get a little bored and complacent with the Marvel universe, along comes this wildly goofy, stylistically autistic adventure that is Marvels most cosmic outing yet.
The prologue shows us young Peter Quill having to say goodbye to his dying mother; in his grief, he runs out into a field and is abducted into an alien spaceship. Cut to many years later, Quill (Chris Pratt) has become a galactic scavenger, an Indiana Jones whos traded his fedora for a virtual space helmet and his whip for a cosmic blaster. On a deserted planets ruins, he pilfers an orb, not knowing what a powerful relic he holds. Also seeking the orb is Ronan the Accuser, lead general of Thanos the Destroyer (who we last saw laughing at Earth in the end teaser of The Avengers). Thanos two daughters, the green-skinned warrior Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and the blue-skinned cyborg Nebula (both have daddy issues) are also after the orb for different reasons. With a bounty on his head, Quill seeks to unload the orb to a high-class dealer but is taken down by Gamora. Also bounty-hunting for the reward are Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his companion, a living tree known as Groot, (voice of Vin Diesel). In a bumbling chase, they are all captured by the Nova Corp (the intergalactic police of the Marvel universe) and imprisoned. There, they get to know each other and are joined in escape by Drax the Destroyer (wrestler Dave Bautista), whose wife and daughter were killed by Ronan. Once they learn the true nature of the orb, their intentions turn from mercenary to noble, and they join forces to prevent the destruction of the galaxy.

There are a lot of plot threads to follow here, but it is not essential to know all the fan-boy details to enjoy the sheer humor and manic energy on display. You don't need to know the history of Thanos, the intentions of the Collector, the questionable morals of Yondu the pirate, the importance of the infinity stones, or even who Cosmo the Space Dog is; all the plot details, including a reference to Quills real father, are mainly for the hardcore fan. For everyone else, this is the first Marvel film to be played largely for laughs, and there are many, mainly provided by Rocket and Groot and with a charmingly breezy and funny lead turn as Quill from Pratt, known for his role as the dense and childish Andy on NBCs Parks and Recreation. Pratt easily provides as much heart as hijinks, and carries around his moms legacy to him: a mix tape (still played on an old Walkman) of 70s hits that seem an odd but fitting soundtrack to all the sci-fi action. The effects and world designs are outstanding throughout. There are some very nifty gimmicks (Yondus deadly arrow that responds only to his whistle), and the gun-blazing, caustic, but technically crafty Rocket Racoon is sure to be a big hit. Groot even pulls off a Hulk-like winning moment that will have audiences screaming. You may be scratching your head over many plot points (why is Benicio del Toros Collector played like Liberace in Space? Does the powerful Nova Corp really not have a more secure prison system? Did Glenn Closes Nova Prime get her hair done in Oz?) but never mind; strap in for the summers best, most eye-catching diversion yet.

CLICHES: Well, lots; lost family-less misfits band together, the snarly little guy, the gentle giant; but there are more than enough curveballs to offset the clichs SURPRISES: Cosmo the Space Dog; really, no mention even of the earth-based hero Nova, a popular character in the Marvel world? DISTRACTIONS: really don't get Benecio del Toros bizarre take on the Collector; his scene was there for pure exposition or they are setting him up for something bigger in Avengers 2 YOU ALSO LIKEY: The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai (availble on Amazon Instant Video), and Firefly (Netflix)",1437609600,,3853,4.766467065868263

Obviously buy this if your'e looking for a Blu-Ray disc... but if you're looking for a download or regular DVD I'd recommend getting it through other means.

The characters also did not seem to have great chemistry together. Maybe a fan of the comic, who knows all the history, will enjoy it, but my kids and I kept checking the time. And the 40 extra minutes in the credits? If you're not a 'Guardians'  geek, don't bother.",1436572800,,470,4.402298850574713

6907959,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Well, gotta say, this is a movie that has something for all sci-fi fans, plenty of action, colourful characters,
and a great measure of humour, with one-line quips a-plenty.
It tells the tale of 'Earthling' 'Peter Quill' (Chris Pratt) self proclaimed 'Star-Lord' a galactic-chancer, stealing
an 'Orb' unaware of the attention it is about to create.
The theft leads to 'Bounty' hunters trying to track down 'Peter' to reclaim the stolen item.
'Peter' stumbles upon a trio of characters he will in time call friends including the resourceful 'Rocket' a fast
talking and gun-toting Raccoon,(voiced by Bradley Cooper) a humanoid Tree (voiced by Vin Diesel) and
assassin 'Gamora' (Zoe Zaldana)
When the four land up in prison the team is completed by the revengeful 'Drax' (Dave Bautista) who will
escape alongside the dysfunctional four.
They learn that 'Ronan' (Lee Pace) is in persuit of the 'Orb' which 'Peter' is begining to realize has much power,
he needs to take the Orb to it's rightful place on the planet 'Zelda' in the care of 'Nova Prime' (Glenn Close)
However 'Ronan' arrives to relieve them of the 'Orb' which gives 'Drax' who blames 'Ronan' for the death of
his wife and child, the oportunity for revenge, but he's no match one to one.
'Ronan' plans to use the power of the device to destroy Zelda and it's billions of occupants, now he has the Orb
can anything stop him.
'Peter' attempts to rally his squabbling companions to join him in a seemingly impossible task of facing 'Ronan'
and his overwhelming force in battle, the future of the Galaxy depends upon the outcome.....................'RISE'

6907964,5,B00R8GUXPG,I am groot. It was a great movie. We had family movie night with this one and my child loved it. Ita one that watching more then once is going to happen. It had a mix of sci fi and comedy it was an all around great movie.,1435708800,,221,3.625
6907965,5,B00R8GUXPG,Very good space movie.,1435708800,,22,4.75
6907966,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, roller coaster of a movie!  I saw it in the theater when it was first released and really enjoyed it. This is a spirited movie with a lighter touch. It brings together a group of misfits and losers and transforms them into heroes: The Guardians of the Galaxy. The story line and pace is great and you're left hoping that it won't be long for the sequel. Highly recommended if you like quick paced action movies that don't take themselves too seriously.",1435708800,,486,4.46067415730337
6907967,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I remember last year when I went to see this in the theatre.  My expectations were kinda low for a few reasons.  For one thing, I had only the vaguest of ideas who the guardians of the galaxy were.  Keep in mind that I have read comics for a few years and looked up a lot of the marvel universe.  With this in mind, I was pretty sure that Marvel was just trying to cash in on the success of their other franchises like Iron Man and Avengers.

After leaving the theatre I was pleased with the movie.  I really enjoyed it and thought it was pretty cool.  I like the character of Ronan and thought he was quite menacing even in a slightly more silly movie like this.  I also enjoyed Chris Pratt's performance and thought he pulled off the goofball bro with enough edge to still kick ass.

Then, a few months later I watched the movie on HBO and realized that the soundtrack is amazing.  This should be obvious to anyone who sees the movie but for some reason it took a while to resonate with me.  I love that Bowie song while they are flying into the big alien head.

All in all, I can say that this is my favorite of the marvel movies and speaks to the needlessness of making all these damn remake movies hollywood is so fond of.  Guardians was a huge hit and no one even knows who the guardians are.",1435622400,,1298,4.144

6908064,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Our story follows Peter Quinn, aka Star Lord, (Chris Pratt) a rogue retriever (or thief and smuggler depending on who you ask) who has headed out on his own to retrieve a sphere from a mysterious planet.  However, by double crossing the rest of his retriever clan, they now want to punish him.  Meanwhile, other people show up to try to get it from him.

The result is a chase across space and a fight when he tries to sell this sphere.  See, it turns out that the sphere is actually wanted in an intergalactic ethnic fight, and it could help one side destroy the other.  With so much on the line, Quinn must team up with the very people he was just fighting against, including assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket the Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), to break out of prison and get the sphere into the right hands.  Can this new team learn to trust each other enough to succeed?

Having never even heard of these characters until I started hearing about the movie, I didn't really know what to expect.  But before I even got into the theater, I'd started hearing great things about it.  They were all correct.

Even without any background going into the film, I thought it did a great job of giving us the background we needed to fill in the pieces of the story.  I don't have all the species names quite down, but I could easily follow which side the characters were on, so it was easy to root for the heroes and against the villains.

The movie never bogs down in exposition.  The characters are introduced and the background given as the story unfolds.  While it meant I had to pay close attention early on to get everything, I found it entertaining throughout.

The characters are wonderful.  Over the course of the film, we get to know our five heroes quite well, and I like them and the relationships they form.  While I didn't quite feel the emotion we were supposed to at the end, that was a minor quibble.

Meanwhile, there's the wonderful humor.  There are tons of funny one liners, and at times even a character's expression got a laugh from me and the rest of the audience.

The acting was great as well.  Whether an actual actor or just a voice actor, there was not a false moment to take you out of the fun.

Likewise with the action and special effects.  Two of the main characters are computer generated.  The movie is set in space.  Plus there are several action sequences.  Never once did I stop to think about what I was watching; instead, I was pulled into the story and enjoyed every second of it.

Because Peter left Earth in the late 80's, he's got a cassette tape of music from the 70's and 80's.  This forms the basis of the soundtrack, and the producers use it perfectly to reflect the mood and draw even more laughs from the audience.

My one complaint was the crude language.  It wasn't swearing as much as it was other off color words.  I'm not quite sure why it bothered me so much here, but it did.  Just be aware of the PG-13 rating going in and you'll be fine.  (The rating also comes from the violence, which was about what I expected.)

If you are like me and have no real idea who the Guardians of the Galaxy are, don't miss your chance to find out.  This is a fun movie that will entertain everyone who goes to watch it.",1434585600,,3318,4.374795417348609

This movie is delightfully funny, well-written and acted, and thoroughly entertaining.  Chris Pratt is a comedic genius.  Groot is a hilarious and touching character, which is not easy to convey when only uttering the same line over and over again.  The music brought me back to fun-filled childhood memories.

6908140,3,B00R8GUXPG,"The film wasn't bad as far as Marvel films go, but it did go a little over the top with the CGI and tended to look like a video game for many sequences. There's also a strong 'Star Wars' parallel that comes across, with a Han Solo-style lead, a Chewie-tree character fighting against enromous spaceships with copious red and green laser blasts, a big sword fight at the end with a hand severed, and even a ship fighting sequence with a remark like ""there's too many of them."" I wasn't sure if this was deliberate or if Star Wars is just so big it's hard not to copy from it?

Regardless the film wasn't bad, and the character interaction was enjoyable, but what I found really disappointing was the strong level of profanity in this film. Sure, no F-bombs, but plenty of other crass talk and language (mostly from, of all people, the talking raccoon character?) Marvel does a disservice to younger viewers and honestly I only watched this with the older kids, because the volume of language used in the film felt more like an R-rating.",1433980800,,1035,4.53475935828877

6908222,3,B00R8GUXPG,"Chris Pratt is great. At most everything he does. Zoe Salamander (or whatever her name is) is fine, but at this rate, she's played on 'Star Trek', 'Avatar' and 'Guardians'. She's almost sci-fi boxed in. I'm not sure what it says when I found the best character to be Groot.

The action is fine. The story is fine.....but in many ways, predictable. You have a 99% chance of who will perish and who will not. You have a 96% chance of knowing the ending of the antagonist isn't really the end the first time they succumb to death. You know how the bickering between male and female characters will turn out.

The biggest surprise was probably Glenn Close's hair. And that some of the space folks looked like John C. Reilly when they weren't actually him.

It was fine. It was fun - but don't go in expecting anything you haven't seen before.",1433116800,,838,4.4640522875816995
6908223,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I am among the majority of people (I assume) who said 'who are the Guardians of the Galaxy' when the movie was first announced. I did a little research on them before watching the film, at the time there were dozens of articles to choose from thankfully, but I was still blown away by how fun GotG was. I realize that there were likely several changes from the source material, as there always is when adapting to different mediums, but that didn't matter to me as I still knew very little about them.

I won't detail what I liked and didn't care for, which is my usual format for reviews, so I'll just say that this movie is entertainment at its finest; landing right up there with the Avengers in regards to comic-book films IMHO. It can be enjoyed by any age group and has a great balance of humor, suspense, drama, and action. As an added bonus, being roughly the same age as Chris Pratt/Peter Quill, I also felt the soundtrack was fantastic!",1433116800,,946,4.436781609195402

6908237,4,B00R8GUXPG,"The movie is very entertaining.  A little crude here and there, but overall language and content is clean enough for most audiences.  The ""cosmic"" plot is extremely zany, and the bad guy a little too ""out there"" for my taste, but to be honest, I wasn't very interested.  It's all about the 5 main characters and the way they play off each other.  Very heavy on CG - if that matters to anyone.  There's a good amount of action, but only the end battle is the sterotypical, all adrenaline, somewhat mindless melee common in Marvel films.  There's a surprising, and freshing, amount of engagement scenes in which characters use unique tools, moves, or stategies.  I enjoyed this.

6908262,4,B00R8GUXPG,"As an avid comic book collector in my childhood, I never really got into any of The Guardians of the Galaxy comic books.  Honestly, I cannot even remember seeing any at the comic book stores I used to frequent. So, when I first heard about this movie, I made up my mind not to watch it, but then I heard that it ties into the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe, so I decided to give it a chance.  Right off the bat, after the first few minutes, I realized that I would probably ejoy it.  It was well-written and well-acted.  I even enjoyed the music.  It turned out to be a fantastic movie, and I'm actually looking forward to the sequel.

If you've been following the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then you'll definitely want to watch this one, and pay attention to everything that is mentioned about the Infinity Stones and Thanos, as both will play a huge part in the upcoming films.  There's a real fantasy-epic feel to the movie, and it reminded me a little of Star Wars.  I'd watch it again.",1432857600,9,1005,4.394594594594595

All the main actors were excellent, but what the writers/directors/animators did with Rocket: ""his"" lines and his facial expressions was my favorite.  The Blue-Ray's audio-visual was excellent.

6908296,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This is simply an awesome movie.  This movie proves what I have always known.  It's not great special effects and cinematography that make a great movie(although this movie does a great job in each of those categories).  What truly makes a great movie is the story line...and maybe even more importantly, the characters.  Every character in this movie was great.  You truly liked and pulled for the good guys...as imperfect as each of them is; and even the not so good guys were not bad in the usual cliche way.  The acting was brilliant from everyone involved, the humor was very well done; it was very organic and not too campy....and the music was great.  Quite frankly, there is nothing about this movie I didn't like.  Again, it's the character that make this movie what it is.  If you have characters that you don't really care about, or don't feel any emotional attachment to...then you can only enjoy the movie so much.  But when you have characters portrayed as well as the characters were in this film...you have a 5 star film.  Check this one out...you won't be disappointed.",1432512000,,1086,4.693121693121693

6908302,1,B00R8GUXPG,"Why do people like this movie?  I get that it's supposed to poke fun at the science fiction B films, but that just isn't enough.  How is it, that by saying you're mocking bad films, you can then get a huge budget to make a bad film.  People seem way to easily pleased by the latest gimmick that's going.  If you intend to mock something, there needs to be and underlying intelligence that fuels it, otherwise you're just getting a lot of money to make a less intelligent and even more unoriginal piece of garbage than the garbage your making fun of.
I do have 2 praises for Guardians of the Galaxy.  One, beautiful special effects.  Two, the absolute genius of it's creators in knowing that if you stick a 170 million dollar barrage of special effects in front of most humans (and monkeys, though probably more humans) you can make a fortune without the bother of acting, script, or plot.  Bravo.",1432425600,7,896,4.493827160493828

6908309,5,B00R8GUXPG,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, I love sci-fi and I've been getting tired of hero movies where the main character(s) are seemingly good because it's the right thing to do and not much else.

Rocket the bad-ass raccoon is wonderfully played by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as Groot the empathic tree is amazing.  There is plenty of action and enough pathos to make the movie interesting and intensify the humor.  The best superhero movie I have seen in years.  Rocket is a riot.  Chris Pratt as Quill, or Star Lord as the character prefers to be known, is superb in holding the motley group together and being the center of the action.

Great film more dark than all the rest.  Guardians of the Galaxy reminds me of the lighter weight Star Wars type of sci-fi as opposed to the Blade Runner model.  Snappy one liners that sound like expressions from today's society.  A light-hearted funny hero, etc.  While I did enjoy this movie, it was not serious enough for me and I am not a fan of Chris Pratt.  I think he was horribly mis-cast in this film.

6908474,4,B00R8GUXPG,"This was kind of a weird movie in the Marvel universe; the characters were very quirky and hard to understand early on. As a result, the start of the movie did feel a bit disjointed and slow to build momentum; there were a lot of very separate and unique characters to introduce with vastly separate lives and origins, but the movie did manage to bring this to a head in as reasonably fast a manner as was probably possible given these constraints. Once the movie starts picking up momentum, it does get more immersive and I did find myself enjoying it more, becoming more lost in the world as opposed to feeling like I'm just watching through a window but still strongly aware that I'm watching a movie. Due to the entertaining characters and improvement in the pace of the movie as it progresses, I will give this one 4 stars rather than 3. I am glad I saw it, and I probably will actually rewatch it once or twice, making purchasing it a worthwhile choice. If you like quirky sci-fi, or if you love all parts of the Marvel universe, you will probably find this to be a worthwhile watch.",1431302400,2,1089,4.422885572139304

As a matter of fact, I hadn't seen ANY of the Marvel movies put out in the last decade, so I prepared myself to just get through it while I watched with friends.  I could not have been more pleasantly surprised!  The movie is a ton of fun, it doesn't take itself too seriously (as many similar movies do), and it was visually gorgeous.  I also laughed a ton.  Months after seeing it, I had to buy it on Blu-Ray.  Now that is saying something.

6908499,5,B00R8GUXPG,"My wife and I immensely enjoyed this family friendly title put out by Marvel Studios. I am a long time fan of Marvel comics and to see some of these stories come to life on the big screen is surreal. The plot, acting, and occasional comedy made for an excellent movie watching experience.",1431129600,,288,4.452830188679245
6908500,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Very fun characters.  Surprising and uplifting use of classic music.  Main characters struggle with some social scars, then come together to reinforce strong friendship and life values.  This movie makes subtle ties to other Marvel characters employed in a universal scheme now being franchised.  IE: Avengers and Agents of SHIELD.  Specifically: Thanos and the Kree.  Periodic use of classic pop music from (generally) the 70's is a departure from any other Marvel enterprise; and is executed very well.  The story is a well executed formulation to suit the music used.  Original theatrical music is seamlessly blended though out; making this a well polished production.

Parents beware.  Hopefully, children will not understand an incidental and cryptic adult joke.

Audience will be quickly distracted from disasters by the endurance of main characters, fun music, and awesome scenery.  But, deadly violence is used as a punch line.  Suffering is not appreciated until it happens to a main character.  As usual, not even bruising occurs.  When simple bullets and guns are used, they are not shown for the reality and respect they deserve.  Ray guns are understood to be fantasy.  Only mature minds should re-enter society afterward seeing this and any Hollywood production.  The seriousness of despair and non-value of life in prison, and to prison inmates, and incidental deaths of hundreds of unknown cannon fodders in battle is distorted or dismissed for the convenience of the plot and attention span of audience.  In this respect, story can be compared to Star Wars.

Moments of facing and contemplating one's own death for a greater good are used for pivotal character development.  These moments are not wasted, but happen with deliberate purpose; and are the most redeeming elements of the movie.

Logistics, common sense, or motivation on the part of protaganists and antaganists are sacrificed when the plot needs it.  Story begins with tragedy, which serves as background for a main character.  After that, an unlikely scenario is staged to set the rest of story in motion.  This premise is not explained, but is reinforced briefly near the end as a foreshadow for a sequal.  A mystery for the next movie.  In the end the audience is reassured and comforted with feelings of hope and love by sunshine, uplifting music, and a subtle surprise that springs from the death of one of the main characters.  Another foreshadow for a sequal.",1431129600,,2447,5.1265822784810124

The entire movie seems a little ""out there"", and that's what makes it work so well.  Put in a soundtrack that tops among one of the recent best, and you have a great night at the movies.",1430956800,,433,4.5256410256410255

I laughed more than I have for some time now. I will have this in my DVD collection soon.

6908610,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I love this movie! It's way better than the trailers suggest. I have been a fan of Chris Pratt since his days on Parks & Rec. Very funny guy! He was heavier then, but now he's totally ripped. No doubt that has led to him landing these huge roles. I need to get on his workout plan!!

The plot is pretty straight forward. Bad guy wants to destroy the world and desires godly powers. A band of unlikely heroes comes together to fight against the galactic threat. Initially, they are all driven by their own personal desires: money, revenge and simple circumstance, but they soon realize that the threat is much larger than their personal ambitions and they decide to work together for a common cause. There are moments of sadness that tinge the mood of the film with some semblance of seriousness, but don't expect an Oscar-caliber, introspective film. This movie is all about the fun factor, comedy, action and excitement. There is some minor intrigue to be found, particularly just who IS Star Lord's dad? But, those questions are not answered and may or may not lead to a sequel.

Young and old alike will enjoy this film. The violence is not over the top and more playful; it's age appropriate for youngsters. Enjoy!",1430438400,,1218,4.6342592592592595

6908683,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I really love this movie.  This is one you can laugh or jive with and will likely watch over and over.  Our hero, Peter Quill, as a child was transported to space and as an adult is a thief and a bit of a loser.  He has a chip on his shoulder too.  The dialog is really sharp and funny and the characters have done an exceptional job in creature  interesting characters.  You could enjoy this movie on the dialogue alone.  Theres constant action as our hero meets up with four others who are all vested in cashing in on the silver orb.  Of course the villain wants this powerful orb which turns this movie into a hilarious romp around the galaxy as our five put together heros try to save the galaxy.

The movie reminds me of my other favourite The Fifth Element for its comedy and creation of interesting characters.  Watching it a second time and loving it.",1430006400,,859,4.3125

6908687,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I think this is a very good movie, but the 3D version made this a GREAT!!! movie!  There is so much to look at, sometimes it is hard to figure out what is what, with the regular version.  With the 3D version, everything is in layers, so you can really tell what is going on and where.  You notice so much more, even from the very beginning. It was very rewarding to see them use 3D in a way that gives depth to a movie and not just have objects being thrown at you for a 3D effect.
Tons of fun and love the music!
I highly recommend it.  So Enjoy!",1429920000,,547,3.900900900900901

6908828,5,B00R8GUXPG,Marvel's new chapter in the MCU (Marvel Cinnematic Universe) introduces elements of fun and whimsy to their familiar formula of action and adventure.  I can't wait for the next installment.  The teasers planted at the end regarding Star Lord's father sets the stage for the continuation of this perspective on the quest for the infinity stones that may spell the end of our universe (at least as we know it!),1429315200,,408,4.814285714285714

Either I need to get better wifi (which is not going to happen due to the fact that I am a student and I just wanted to enjoy this movie...) or Amazon needs to change to whatever Hulu/Netflix does so that the quality doesn't get affected bc of the wifi.,1429228800,,463,4.043478260869565

6908864,4,B00R8GUXPG,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a good movie. It has a great story and a little comedic. This is a very unusual superhero movie because it takes place in outer space for all of the movie and that has never happened before in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
This is for OLDER AUDIENCES really not for kids that much. There is a lot of swears. Really bad swears that the main characters say and a little inappropriate it for younger viewers.
This is a good film overall just not really for younger kids.

6908940,4,B00R8GUXPG,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a comic sci-fi adventure based on the Marvel Comic of the same name. In 1988, young Peter Quill (Wyatt Oleff) is abducted from Earth by aliens shortly after his mother dies. Peter is raised by the space pirate Yondu (Michael Rooker), his only connection to his human past being a cassette tape of 1970s pop hits given to him by his mother. Peter (Chris Pratt) grows up to be something of an outlaw himself. On the planet Morag, he pilfers an ancient orb that is also sought by the Cree fanatic Ronan (Lee Pace), a militant who intends to eradicate the Xandarians, with whom the Cree had been at war for 1000 years before entering an uneasy peace. Ronan sends the assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to retrieve the orb from Peter. But a pair of mercenary bounty hunters are also on Peter's trail: a genetically modified raccoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his laconic sidekick, a genetically modified tree named Groot (Vin Diesel).

""Guardians of the Galaxy"" offers up the good-natured irreverence of ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" and the space opera action-adventure of the original ""Star Wars"" films. It's a lot of fun, and we always know it will end well. Chris Pratt's handsome, swashbuckling rogue is sexier than almost any hardbody action star, without ever taking himself seriously. There is a bit of Han Solo in him. Men will enjoy his adventures and his swagger, but women will drool. It's nice to see something for the ladies. The film's soundtrack consists entirely of those melodious 1970s pop songs on Peter's ""Awesome Mix Vol. 1"" cassette tape -and ""Cherry Bomb"" by the girl pop-punk band ""The Runaways"", which plays during action sequences. I hear that song more now than I did in the 1970s and 1980s. The soundtrack is available on CD and actually reached the Billboard 200. This is epic, comic, fluffy sci-fi that really enjoys itself, so the audience does too.",1428624000,,1915,4.803030303030303

6908966,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Five REFRESHING Stars! A really enjoyable SciFi movie. Taking a break from the normal Avengers, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, etc mythology, Marvel Studios deals up a great Guardians of the Galaxy movie, which is the bracing, spirited story of how five unusual personages came together to attempt to save the galaxy. Starring Chris Pratt as Peter Quill aka ""Star Lord"", Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Vin Diesels voice for the animated Groot, Bradley Coopers voice for the animated, smack-talking Rocket the raccoon. Also featured are cameos by Karen Gillan of Doctor Who fame, and Djimon Hounsou of Gladiator fame. The prison scenes are hilarious, as is the line up and description of each character. All of the action centers around a very small, long lost object and the lengths to which all concerned will go to get it. This is a big winner of a production from Marvel Studios with a great storyline and marvelous CGI from end to end. Directed by James Gunn. My Highest Recommendation! Five ENJOYABLE Stars! (Amazon Instant Video. Time-2:01. CC. X-Ray. Marvel is now generating a Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Chris Pratt then went to star as the lead in the hit Jurassic World.)",1428451200,,1201,4.863414634146341

Same plot, similar characters, different setting, same movies. One of these days, people are going to start realizing that the violence in these movies are one reason we have a violent society. I like movies with action and adventure, but the Marvel movies go way too far. If they'd have emphasized characters and humor instead of violence, they'd have had a decent movie-even though it's been done again and again. I would not allow my pre-teen or early teen children watch this stuff. A positive? Very good special effects.",1428364800,,648,4.794642857142857

This is now in my top 10 favorite movies of all time, up there with Big Trouble and The Fifth Element. From those you can tell I love off-beat, different movies that mix genres, especially comedy and sci-fi/fantasy. Guardians delivered Everything I love and then Some. I also LOVE Lee Pace! I can't Wait for the sequel!

One Caveat: I bought the HD version and it SUCKED. Half the movie I had to put up with a fuzzy ""pixeled"" picture. I still loved the movie but for the price I paid for this, I deserved better than fuzzy picture quality.",1428192000,,642,4.487179487179487

It was the kind of surprise that I had way, way, long ago when I was sitting in a Motion Picture Academy screening of ""Star Wars.""  I'll never forget that moment.... none of us knew what we were in for.  When the writing scrolled across the screen and swept us all into its wake...well...i screamed, and loved it and was thrilled.  Same with Guardians of the Galaxy.  It was such a surprise, so much fun, the characters were great, swaggering, handsome and silly.  Love love love this movie.",1428192000,,618,4.407079646017699

6909025,3,B00R8GUXPG,"Amusing. Disposable. Something of a satire for the ""Star Wars"" besotted. Being a satire was free of the unbearable gravitas of so many comic book movies these days. I was slightly turned off by the wretched soundtrack. It's a funny idea. But why, when most movies resurrect the pop music of a bygone era, do they almost invariably serve up a K-tel collection of top forty kitsch? I realize there's some irony at work, but we still have to listen to it. The same thing could have been accomplished with better tunes.",1428105600,,515,4.608695652173913

6909152,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This is one of the best Marvel movies to date.  My family and I enjoyed this again this past weekend.  The story line follows the evolution of a character, Starlord, and lays the foundation for follow on stories.  Some humor is a but on the edge of PG-13 but it goes by pretty quickly.  One of the best elements woven into this movie is the late 70's and early 80's soundtrack.  We are really looking forward to the sequel.",1427673600,,423,4.30379746835443

6909175,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Another great movie from Marvel Studios. I've never read any of the Guardians of the Galaxy comics so i'm not going to base this review off of how closely they made the movie to the comics or not. Just based on the movie itself.
The story is fun and written pretty well. There are some major plot points that kind of just get brushed off because if they weren't then the heroes probably would have died in the first half hour or so. However, I can let that pass, because, who am I kidding, EVERY MOVIE DOES THIS. As long as you aren't expecting the ""bad guys"" to behave in a rational way, then you will love this movie.
The characters are great and each have their own personality. Its fun watching them interact throughout the movie. The computer animation is fantastic. It really draws you into the world that is being created throughout the story. Fun fight and battle scenes. The casting is good, even though I wouldn't have expected Chris Pratt to play that part, but he does a really good job with it. Being serious when he needs to and adding that comedic element throughout to make the character of Starlord stand out.

Overall a great movie if you are a fan of Marvel Studios, superhero movies, or if you just want to watch a great science fiction movie.",1427587200,,1263,4.443965517241379

I actually prefer this to the earthbound Avengers, though the formula is similar.
Where Avengers is serious, this is less so, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and is a more entertaining film for it.
There are funny moments, serious moments, and, honestly, moments that make me want to cry.  This is what film is supposed to do.
One minor criticism of this film is that it never really gives the viewer time to ""breathe.""  which kind of makes it exhausting, but in a good way.

The Marvel comics make for movie gold but how long can it go on.  This movie so surprised me and won me over I don't think there is a movie I enjoyed so completely in my life.  The movie is open to new comers like myself and, from what I gather, the fans of the comic. The story is easy to follow but doesn't plod along.  The acting is top notch and the humor is both subtle but also hilarious The acting is top notch and is cartoonish without being over the top.. The quality of the cast is amazing.

We turned down the lights, turned up the surround, made some wings, had some beers, paused it a time or three for a cig/pee break and had an absolute blast.

I've watched it like six or seven times, and I simply don't do that with modern movies. I've never seen a faster 2 hour 40 minute movie.",1427328000,,561,4.137614678899083

I have stated that it is better than The Avengers, any of the Spider-Man franchises, and now I cannot decide which I liked better, this or Batman Begins. Since they are so different in so many ways, it is not a fair comparison. This movie has heart, where Batman has the darkness the subject requires. This is unlike ANY ""comic book"" movie ever made.

Guardians of the Galaxy

Produced by Marvel Studios

Directed by James Gunn

The Story: Based on the Marvel Comics series of the same name, Guardians of the Galaxy is an action-packed, epic space adventure, that expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the cosmos, where brash adventurer Peter Quill finds himself the object of an unrelenting bounty hunt after stealing a mysterious orb coveted by Ronan, a powerful villain with ambitions that threaten the entire universe. To evade the ever-persistent Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with a quartet of disparate misfits-Rocket, a gun-toting raccoon, Groot, a tree-like humanoid, the deadly and enigmatic Gamora and the revenge-driven Drax the Destroyer. But when Quill discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses to the cosmos, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate stand-with the galaxy's fate in the balance. (Rotten Tomatoes)

The Good: Its Space Opera!

Seriously, there has been a tragic lack of such a medium both on the big screen and the silver screen. What attempts there have been have been met with little success. That is such a problem with tv and movies of a specific genre. For every one good one that comes along there are about a dozen that are either bad or just mediocre. This film takes the Space Opera back to its roots. Cool spaceships, views of outer space, blasters, alien vistas packed to the brim with personality.

The effects of this movie are top notch. A great deal of cg is used, but many practical effects are used, particularly in the more intimate scenes where a tangible material is needed. But it is not just the big things that are impressive. If anything, the small things are even more impressive due in no small part that was always the hardest part. While watching this movie and Rocket shows up, take time to just look at his face. Despite being that of an animal, he is remarkably expressive. Truly a testament to how far CGI technology has come. His eyes widen and contract and you can see his tongue move in his mouth and fur looks soft and cuddly.

At first Rocket just seems like a trigger-happy maniac, but as the film goes on we see a deeper shade of his character and his inner pain. This goes for all of the characters. Drax, Quill, Gamora, and Rocket. Come off as one thing when they first appear but as the film goes on, their characters and stories are deemed much more than meets the eye.

Some characters, such as Ronon and Groot are not that deep but they don't have to be as so much personality is invested into them that they are immediately identifiable. Groot has a lot of heart and Ronon is a diabolical bad guy that is a lot of fun

The greatest thing this movie does is (hopefully) teaches the creative medium a valuable lesson. All of the Marvel titles and even DC titles and even other franchises tend to focus on well known titles and intellectual properties. Superman and Spider-man are expected to draw in the big crowds. Guardians of the Galaxy was a really obscure comic book title, most of us had never even heard of it. Yet this film was a big success, one of the most successful movies of the year. Why? It had great characters and a great story and great effects. If effort is put into something, audiences will respond positively. Quality is in the effort. Hopefully, Hollywood will learn that lesson. Dont expect change overnight though.

The Flaws: Very little is wrong about this movie. It has a great story, a great cast, and it teaches a great lesson.

In recent years, there has been a great deal of discussion and controversy about the diversity or lack thereof of diversity in the comic book medium. The primary audience has deemed by the powers that be, to be heterosexual, caucasian males, which is exactly what Peter Quill is.

The character of Gamora also helps to reinforce this stereotype. Gamora is a strong character but twice in the movie she gets caught by a bunch of thugs and becomes the damsel in distress for the white lead, Peter Quill, to rescue. Gamora is supposed to be master assassin, thats been trained and cybernetically enhanced to be a ruthless killing machine. It seems odd that she would bested by a bunch of prisoners and mercenaries. Again, it falls into the heteronormative paradigms that has dominated entertainment for decades. These facts do not break the movie but it would seem that the film has concurrently broken and reinforced the mold

The only other flaw is really more of a technicality but it is one of those things that bugs the audience. It has been nearly thirty years, so how exactly does a Sony Walkman still keep working? Even Ipods don't last that long.  How has the tape lasted this long? Where does he get Double A batteries in outer space where humans from Earth are still a relative unknown? It can only be surmised that he found some workshop on Xandar to keep his stuff running. Where did he get a tape deck for his ship? That or he has returned to Earth in the preceding time.

Final Verdict: The Worm watched this movie for five nights in a row and never got tired of it. That is how good this movie is.

Five out of Five Stars.

In the short period of time that GofG has been out,  I have watched it more than I have Star Wars over my lifetime so far.

And all kinds of weapons, planets, and people that humans never can imagine appears in this movie! Not only that, this movie is so funny! Unlike other marvel movies, it has funny scenes and actions.

6909322,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Fairly good entertaining Marvel comic book film about a rag tag group of renegade ""Space Society"" drop outs and lone wolf Fighters who reluctantly team up to embark on a quest to save the galaxy.

 I liked the heroes of the story, particularly the raccoon character, found the special effects and action to be adequate along with good stunt performances, but a side of myself felt as if I seen this exact same movie before.  Maybe the ""Fifth Element"", or ""After Earth"" past films about lone wolf people forced to work together for a common cause drifting around the universe.  But never the less we do have a fairly original plot line acted out very well, and the story some how ties in with the other Marvel ""Avengers"" related films in terms of the villain ""Thanos"".

 The story about ""Starlord's"" childhood past losing his mother to cancer I felt was way over the top super sad, the villain in this film was a cookie cutter Hollywood typical bad guy who did not impress nor interest me as much, and I did not get the point of all the 70's rock music but I did enjoy hearing the songs and felt ""Why not?"" as the music played to the sci fi action on screen.  Vin Diesel does an amazing job some how acting as the voice for ""Root"" the tree alien character, with only one continuous short line every time he speaks!

 Pretty darn good film that I give a B-, and two thumbs up slightly for ""Guardians of the Galaxy"".",1426982400,,1413,4.403846153846154

I am a sucker for space operas even though we don't get a lot of them.  This film definitely scratched that itch and if you are a sci-fi or marvel fan this is a must.  I was very surprised by this film, and I cannot wait until the sequel!",1426982400,,491,4.180851063829787

Heroes come from all places and in all shapes and sizes.  Sacrifice, intelligence, fun, generosity, and zeal ... the five GotG let us see each of these important characteristics in new ways, wrapped up in an unconventional definition of family and community.  Plus, we got reintroduced to some great music we'd mostly forgotten about.  I liked that each of the guardians has backstory; they weren't uni-dimensional, but they were still recognizable and relatable.  Personally, I'd have skipped the head-smashing, blood oozing thing at the start.  I was also disappointed that Starlord's philandering was glamorized; treating women as objects and making intimate relationships so, so, so casual and completely self-centric is unfortunately common.

Zoe S killed it, as always, shes great in action movies.  GOTG delivers action, comedy, a tiny bit of romance, and of course awesome characters.  Not sure why Vin D is even mentioned in this movie, he says the same thing the whole movie and you really don't see him, I couldve played his part and you wouldnt have had to pay me as much as I expect he got paid for, but Im a nobody and no one want to hear me talk  tree.

I thank the heavens that it's over. I curse the heavens for allowing its existence in the first place. ""PLEASE LET THE FILM BREAK"" has never gone through my mind more often when watching anything ever. I hesitate to even say I didn't like it, because there IS - NO - IT! The only thing that movie did is be on for two hours! What a characterless, storyless, humorless, structureless, regurgitated vacuum of color, light and noise! The next time I find my self stuck in traffic with the radio broken in the searing heat with no air conditioning and am forced to look at nothing but the ass end of a manure truck, I can now take solace in the fact that at LEAST I'm not watching that movie! I want to find the person responsible for releasing that life extracting waste of existence and I want him brought right here, and I want to look him straight in the eye and I want to tell him what a cheap, lying, no-good, rotten, four-flushing, low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed, ignorant, blood-sucking, dog-kissing, brainless, hopeless, heartless, fat-ass, bug-eyed, stiff-legged, spotty-lipped, worm-headed sack of monkey vomit he is!

6909672,3,B00R8GUXPG,"I have bought several movies from Amazon digital and the convenience of the purchase and having them available for viewing from any device is great.

HOWEVER....

I am a little disappointed in the quality of the video.  Like I said in the heading, this isn't a bandwidth issue.  The movie streamed perfectly, no compression artifacts, no buffering, nothing.  Streaming through a PS4 hard wired to my cable router (50mb service).  The problem is with how dark the movie is.  For some reason the entire movie is about 5 shades darker than I would expect.  For example, the scene at the beginning of the movie where Pratt is dancing to the place where the orb is (kicking little lizards along the way) is almost too dark to really see what is going on.  I have a digital copy of The Hobbit from Amazon also with the exact same problem.  My guess is it has something to do with how they compress the content.  As a point of comparison, I have Netflix running through the same setup without any issues, after the 1st 10 seconds or so of blocky video while the stream catches up, everything looks great with no brightness issues.

I gave Amazon a pass on The Hobbit.  I thought it might be a one time problem.  Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.  I will probably give Amazon a call about this one....I'll update if I get any feedback.",1425945600,2,1342,4.5103734439834025

6909689,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I was a huge comic book fan in the 90s, but by 2001 I had stopped reading them. I remember the Guardians as a cheesy team that never was very relevant to the Marvel Universe. Little did i know they revamped the series in the mid 2000s. So, I never saw this in theaters, despite being a Marvel fan (and Infinity Gauntlet saga being my favorite story). But too many people whose opinions I respect told me that this was a great movie, so i finally broke down and ordered it.

First of all, there is cussing. I don't know why, but i love this fact. They would of had a hard time telling a story about rough and rugged outlaws that were straight edge. Also, its funny. Really funny (at times). They don't themselves too seriously, and that makes them endearing. There are also very sad, touching parts that really dug at my heart, like the story about StarLord's mother (i won't spoil).

So laughter, sadness, and a lot of cool action all in one? How could this NOT be a classic? And at the end the line ""Guardians of the Galaxy...will return."" You're darn right they are!",1425945600,,1068,4.36180904522613

I walked out of the latest installment from the Marvel Universe feeling like I had just watched their best movie thus far and excited about future productions. Because there WILL be future productions Im sure. Of course, with them raising the bar, they have to keep up with that momentum or risk angry fans the world over.

6909741,5,B00R8GUXPG,Toss up whether this or The Avengers is my fav Marvel-comic-to-movie because they're both awesome.  It's probably this one because it doesn't matter if you've never read a comic OR if you've seen any other comic book movie and this is STILL a FANTASTIC and entertaining movie.,1425859200,,276,4.872340425531915
6909742,5,B00R8GUXPG,Perhaps the most entertaining Marvel film to date,1425859200,,49,5.25

6909748,5,B00R8GUXPG,"While I like science fiction, this is a movie I normally would not have spent the time to watch.  When the major characters include a talking racoon and a humanoid tree, I had my doubts.  But what a surprise! This is a unique movie.  It is over-blown, so fantastical in many aspects, yet it is intelligent, witty and down-right funny in parts.  I particularly liked Groot whose only contribution to conversation was always, ""I am Groot,"" to which his friend Rocket would respond as though he had actually said something else.  This is a very creative, imaginative and smart movie.  It is like nothing else I've ever seen!",1425859200,,621,4.703703703703703
6909749,5,B00R8GUXPG,Definitely one of the best Marvel movies so far. It was absolutely hilarious! I'm really excited to see them all in an Avengers movie!,1425859200,,134,4.625

6909752,5,B00R8GUXPG,We enjoyed this movie lots of action and the 3D is great! Will be sharing watching  with the kids again.,1425859200,,104,4.2
6909753,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Great movie. I bought the 1-disc version because I never watch any of the extra stuff anyway and I would rather not pay for it, so this was the right choice for me.",1425859200,,164,4.0

6909767,4,B00R8GUXPG,Great film overall but not that of an amazing Blu-Ray package. Sure it has 3D but it doesn't add anything new to the experience. Special features are nothing new but fun nonetheless. Plus you get to see Baby Groot. But yeah my only beef with it is the price. I don't think the 3D was worth it.,1425772800,,293,4.157894736842105

6909769,5,B00R8GUXPG,"It held true to Marvel Comics. It left questions to be answered in a sequel (which I will watch). It had out of this world action. It had a plant and a raccoon that needed to be taken serious (they brought it on). It had an Earthling so we humans could relate to some of the parts of the movie. It had a green woman in which Captain James T Kirk would have found intriguing. It had a big dumb brute to whom you would just root for.

It's Marvel. It's comic. It's what Adult Swim needs in it's Toonami line-up. It's worthy of a series. It's Guardians of the Galaxy, babyyyyyy!!!",1425772800,,577,4.151785714285714

6909772,5,B00R8GUXPG,Great storyline and acting. I thought it should have received an oscar for its visual effects. I hope this sequel is as good as this. Groot is so exspressive with the one word he says through the whole movie.,1425772800,,208,4.358974358974359
6909773,5,B00R8GUXPG,Might sound strange but one of my top ten all time. I'm no movie purist so there you are. I don't buy movies either but I own this I one!,1425772800,,137,3.6
6909774,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I had to think a bit before giving this 5 stars, because it wasn't the best movie, but I decided it was still a great movie.  Let me explain.  I didn't expect much from this movie, but as I watched it, I laughed and smiled more than I have from any movie I've watched in quite a while.  It was a happy and funny movie.  I needed that kind of movie when I watched it, so I give it 5 stars.

This movie wasn't a movie to make you think much or the best movie of its kind.  It is in my opinion one of the funniest movies of its kind, though.  I don't like to go into the story itself, because I like surprises, and I hope you do too.  I don't want to know the whole story before I watch the movie.

If you want to watch a movie that is fun with lots of action, then this is the movie for you!",1425772800,,789,3.7333333333333334

6909799,4,B00R8GUXPG,"A thoroughly enjoyable movie which takes five C-List Marvel characters and makes them memorable. The only downside to the movie is that the characters themselves are not as diverse as they may seem at first glance. Of the five, they are all criminals in some way. Three of them are the ""Han Solo""/Dashing Rogue with a good heart archetype. Then you have Maximus from Gladiator turned into an alien. Finally, there's Groot, the space Treant. They are still great characters, but there's a lack of balance to the group. They're kinda like the cast of Firefly meets Star Wars. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie immensely, just be aware of what you're getting into.",1425686400,,668,4.767241379310345
6909800,1,B00R8GUXPG,"Not sure if I somehow my system downloaded some fake movie, but whatever Guardians of the Galaxy that downloaded to my TV is boring, predictable and nearly put me to sleep half way through.

It is currently paused at the 1:30 mark and our 6 year old decided he would rather brush his teeth and go to bed than sit through any more of this movie.  Not sure if I am going to bother watching the rest of it or just join him in slumber land where I have no doubt even the most incomprehensible of dreams will be far more interesting than this film.",1425686400,8,543,4.161904761904762

I can't see movies in 3D, so that is completely useless to me, and I don't feel like buying the digital version for almost the same price as the physical copy.  I wish they would have released a combo pack with just the regular Blu-ray and digital copy combo pack.  For that I understand spending $25.",1425513600,,658,4.3884297520661155

Lots of often subtle humor built in. Awesome CGI graphics. Hard-to-explain powers emanating from man's (and woman's) extremities; 250 lb highly portable and maneuverable weapons carried around by... well, everybody except those who don't need weapons because of what emanates from their extremities. Monsters. Really scary bad guys. Even scarier good guys. Interesting walking, talking trees. Buff humans co-exist with awesome hyper-humanoid creatures sometimes--okay, often--at odds with each other. Super-advanced machinery that is... well... 'way too complicated for me to operate let alone imagine what it does. Inspiring architecture. Evil is bad and gets zapped, good is good and smiles storyline. My nine year-old grandson loved it. Not bloody. Not gruesome. Scary, though. Grandma loved it. I loved it. Fun--and enjoyable--to watch.",1425427200,,1004,5.4423076923076925
6909946,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Best of the Marvel franchise.  Largely, I think, this is becomes Chris Pratt seems to have so much fun!
First half is definitely best ... yup ... slows down toward the end, still ... if you like space adventure / underdog / orphan who grows up to be good ... sounds formulaic?
Watch, more than once, the first ten minutes ... and not choke as a child is brought in to say goodbye to his dying mother.  Contrast that with the joy of 'Star Lord's dance sequence and 'Indiana Jones' moment ... LOL.",1425427200,,495,4.311827956989247

6909954,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Get this:  Marvel took an obscure bunch of C-List heroes and made a thoroughly fun film out of it.  DC, are you paying attention?  Because the ""darker, edgier"" approach doesn't seem to be working for you anymore.

I didn't know that much about the Guardians from my own days as a comic reader, and frankly, I didn't have much confidence that Marvel could pull this one off.  But they did.  And how did they do it?  By not going for your typical superhero film.  This is not ""Avengers In Spaaaaace!""  This is a rag-tag group of criminals, pirates, and weirdos who come together to stop a galactic threat.

Yes, the film is silly at times.  I mean, seriously - SPOILERS! - they stop the main bad guy with a dance-off!  But that silliness is part of its charm.  But it can also be very tense and heart-touching as well.

I gave this movie a 5/5.  Not because it is a perfect film - it's not - but because it is a movie I can enjoy watching over and over again.",1425340800,,957,4.238888888888889

I love all the Marvel movies that have been coming out in the past decade (except the butchery done to Spiderman and most of the X-men movies, I refuse to acknowledge Ghost Rider, Fantastic Four, and Dare Devil mainly because they suck), that said, this is the best one yet. It's funny through the entire film, it's got awesome visuals and effects, it feels more a space opera than a superhero film, and it never feels like 2 of the 5 main characters are CGI. It's like the Avengers (which I loved) but with lots of laughs and light heartedness in place of the darkened morale conflicts and egotism of our earthly heroes. Just watch it. My personal advice, if you rewatch films, just buy it.",1425254400,,734,4.485074626865671

6910083,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Even though I'm a big Marvel fan, I thought this movie looked too weird and different in the beginning. I recently begun to get excited for it with all the good reviews and I have to say, this might be the most different and fun Marvel movie I've seen. I've heard people say that it's the best Marvel film yet but it's not quite there. It's third or fourth for me. Chris Pratt is excellent in this movie and he gave a performance as charismatic as Robert Downey Jr. in the Iron Man movies. Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, and Vin Diesel are all pretty good with what they're given. Bradley Cooper is great as the voice of the scene stealing Rocket. The story is really good and the use of music in this movie is great. The only problem I had with the movie was that it was a tad bit slow at one point and the villain was not that great. Thanos was much more interesting to me even with his limited screen time. While not as bad as Malkeith in Thor 2, Ronan is definitely not a villain that I'd call interesting. I found Karen Gillan's villain much better and I'd like to see more of her in the sequel. The movie also had a few emotional moments that were really great and I wasn't expecting. Overall, this is a really fun movie that I can't wait to see again.",1425168000,,1255,4.190082644628099

The CGI sequences were, so to speak, ""shot"" from some sort of rotating camera viewpoint, so that all the explosions, zooming spacecraft, worlds of ""evil empires"" caused in me more vertigo than excitement. The story was so derivative and trite that I gave up caring why who was doing whatever to whomever. I was hoping that in the end the Orb would blow up the theater I was sitting in.

Let us pray that they never never make a sequel.

6910185,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I'm only gonna review the technical aspects of the movie, as you either like it or don't. I bought the Blu-ray 3D movie, which included a standard Blu-ray version. The 3D is just plain spectacular and really ads a lot to the movie. Audio is sharp and clear, and the music really sounds great. Be advised that even though this movie is Blu-ray, when you watch it on a wide screen HD TV, it WILL be letterboxed. That is because of the 2.40-1 aspect ratio. I had the same thing with the movie ""Fury"". The 3D version also changes aspect ratios, but it is SUPPOSED to do that because of the way it was filmed. Other movies in 3D do the exact same thing. Anyway, my opinion it is definitely worth the money. Buy it. Enjoy it. I AM GROOT!  :-)",1425081600,,736,4.219858156028369

6910188,3,B00R8GUXPG,"While abit overrated on rotten tomatoes, Guardians of the Galaxy is still an action packed thrill ride that doesn't fail to deliver.  While there are some characters in the movie that are flat, the villian is somewhat one dimensional, there are CHEAP attempts at emotional manipulation towards the end, and even CHEAPER cameos, Guardians still manages to be a fun movie. This is due to the stunning visual effects, great action sequences, and a great soundtrack straight from memory lane. All those factors help to make up for Guardians of the Galaxy's shortcomings and makes it a fun sci fi movie you'll want to watch again and again.",1425081600,,635,4.87962962962963

Marvel has a wonderful way of interjecting humor into serious moments without losing the gravity of the moment or the humor of the joke, and that is sort of a subtitle for GotG. My critique of the movie is that, as often happens with the first movie of a book or other source, it tries to fit too much into too short of a time. A lot of characters are fit into the movie without enough characterization, leading to some confusion about who some of these people are, both in relation to each other regarding levels of power as well as just an overall question of what is happening and why. But the characters are fun, the plot moves quickly, in my opinion, it's full of action and humor, and it gives you fun half-heroes. The heroes are relatable people who are not good for the sake of being good but instead average people who occasionally have to choose to do extraordinarily good things. And being average, they don't always have the grace of a superhero down, which can be enjoyably refreshing. All in all, one of my favorite Marvel movies, if for nothing else than a very balanced level of humor and action. Very well done.",1424736000,,1337,4.439024390243903

We had heard a lot of good comments about the movie and were interested in seeing it for ourselves.  The movie did not disappoint. The re-occurring theme of the familiar 1980's hit songs gave just the right touch of great music and comedy to this movie.  I especially loved the scenes with Chris Pratt dancing around at the beginning of the movie.  Given the sad and serious nature of the opening scenes, the dancing set the right tone for the rest of the movie.  After seeing it for ourselves, we understand why so many people enjoyed it.  The action and the imagery were both excellent as well.

If you have not seen this movie then I recommend it.  Having purchased the Blu-ray I am confident that we will be watching it again and again.  We also look forward to the promised sequel.",1424476800,,887,4.425925925925926

6910573,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This is definitely a fun space romp.  You don't watch it for a deep plot or totally accurate space sequences (of which neither apply).  You watch it for the humor above all else.  I really liked Expendables because it screamed ""I don't make much sense, but let's have fun anyway"" and Guardians of the Galaxy is no different.  Maybe that makes it more of a guy movie (and my wife didn't find it as good as I did).",1424476800,,412,4.243589743589744

This has the attitude of the first Star Wars movie, or the first Raiders: a real adventure, real life-or-death action, without a heavy hand on dramatic dialog, and a good sense of humor, that varies among the characters, from snark to doofus to stil-working-on-grown-up.

I'll probably end up owning it.",1424390400,,356,4.933333333333334

6910621,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I'm not going to review the actual movie. It's great. A ton of critics and websites can attest to that. Instead I'll focus on the value.

I picked this up right when it came out. For $20, I got the Blu-Ray (and 3D Blu-Ray) plus the digital download. The process to redeem the download is a bit of a pain, but essentially you get a credit for the online store of your choice. I chose Amazon. It downloaded perfectly. I now have it on a couple of iPads, plus I can stream it on the Roku.

From now on, I'll never pay $20 or more for a movie that doesn't include a digital copy. I've loaned the physical Blu-Ray to several people. No problem, because my son can easily stream it whenever he wants to. Plus, no worrying about losing the actual disc.

I'm convinced digital copies are the way to go. It's just irritating that they're often more expensive than a physical copy. Hence my new obsession with Blu-Ray plus digital copy packages.",1424390400,,935,4.362068965517241

I never thought a humanoid tree would cause me to tear up, but Groot did! It is basically the story of the sad orphan beginning to discover who he is, but it is well done.

6910877,3,B00R8GUXPG,"It was a good adventure movie, but some of the characters were a little flat. I wasn't particularly endeared to Star Lord (Chris Pratt) - I think he was playing the role fairly accurately to what it was designed for, I just didn't like him. I also wasn't particularly interested in Gamora, as the character didn't seem particularly built out. Groot and Rocket were the high-points in characters, with Drax taking an interesting straight-man slot in the film.

The story itself was standard fare for Sci-Fi - not bad, just nothing innovative. It's nice to see something new, props to Marvel for taking a chance on bringing out something that wasn't going to be a guaranteed hit. I just didn't think it was as good as everyone else seems to have thought. I'll watch it again someday.",1424304000,,781,4.700729927007299

6910881,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Soo much fun!  Based on a fringe portion of the Marvel Universe, it handles exposition well and leaves you guessing as to who Peter's father really is.  The action is good but it's the dialogue and comedic timing of the main cast that keeps it from becoming too earnest.  Never taking itself too seriously, it allows suspension of belief to occur naturally.  Let's face it.  If you can believe in a talking tree and raccoon, you'll love this!",1424304000,,442,4.615384615384615

6910968,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Love this movie. It sounded odd going in (having never read the comic books), a talking raccoon, a green girl, a walking tree that says 3 words? It's amazing though. My favorite Marvel movie, and that is saying a lot.",1424217600,,217,4.45
6910969,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Even though I know most comic book heroes I knew nothing about he Guardians of the Galaxy and I was unsure of what I was going to get when the movie came out. But I was very happy to find out that this movie was great, one of the best out of all the marvel movies.  This movie ranks up with the Avengers and Captain America 2.

Chris Pratt was perfectly cast and carries the movie with ease. The rest of the hero cast does a great job. The action and laughs are plentiful.

The only real proble with the movie is the weak villians.  Ronan is evil, because he is evil and want to blow up a planet...because he is evil. I feel that Nebula would have been a better character to focus on.",1424217600,,684,4.044444444444444

6910975,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie stands not only as one of the best Marvel movies, but as one of the best Sci-Fi's I have ever seen. It is hilarious, action-packed, and dramatic. Every character shines on their own, but the true beauty is the interaction between seemingly unalike characters. As you get to know them, you learn that despite their vastly different backgrounds, they share the common desire to be something more. Even Groot, a walking tree that can only utter the words ""I am Groot"" manages to captivate you with his charm and personality. This is without a doubt the funniest superhero movie I have ever seen, and yet it doesn't sacrifice the integrity of the story.",1424217600,,660,4.747826086956522

6910979,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Look, it's not the most creative plot. Some of the characters are fairly static. But oh boy, do I love it. I find it to be a refreshing blend of comedy and (sometimes a bit dark) action. I really enjoyed Pratt's performance; he definitely fits the role. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable movie with an average plot that is lifted up by entertaining characters and dialogue.",1424217600,,374,4.597014925373134

6911035,3,B00R8GUXPG,"The movie was was awesome, loved it, great story, great action, easily a 5 star movie, however this movie on blu-ray sucked enough to drop two stars. Specifically the audio, for the entire movie I had to turn the volume way up to be able to hear any of the dialog then way back down for any explosions/action scenes. This is called poor audio mixing. I should be able to set the volume level and leave it for the entire movie and still be able to clearly hear all the dialog and not get blasted out of the room by any explosions/action scenes. I don't have this volume problem with anything other than some blu-ray movies. In the movie theaters, on DVDs, on streaming services, and on TV the audio can be mixed properly, why can't it be done properly on blu-ray too?

6911125,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie has many small flaws but somehow finishes with a feeling of ""I love this movie and I really couldn't care less about the little hiccups!""  I don't know how they managed it since I usually get turned off by things like a character's face and voice not synching but for this movie I just couldn't stop being more and more of a fanboy.

I've probably played it over 100 times now (often just for happy background 'listen-watching' while working at home) and watched it dozens.

And I have some favorite quotes.  I don't think they are spoilers (not giving context for them) but just in case I'll alert:  (Possible) SPOILER ALERT!

Quotes I think you too will love after you see this movie:
========================================
Quill:  ""Star-Lord, man, legendary outlaw?""
---
Rocket:  ""Oh  Yeah.""
---
Gamora:  ""Who put the sticks up their butts?""  (Disclaimer for those who might be concerned:  This is not a foul reference.)
---
Ronan (looking almost like he's going to cry):  ""What are you doing?""
---
Drax:  ""What percentage of an idea?""
---
Quill:  ""Dance-off, bro, me and you.""",1423785600,,1093,4.864130434782608

6911179,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I've spent the last 30 minutes or so reading comments on this movie, good and bad, and even replied to a few, so now it's time to put my two cents worth in.  First, I find it interesting that roughly half of the negative comments I've read were directed at technical issues, not the movie itself.  Now, on to my review.  Among the most common negative comments are poor character development, lack of a plot, uninteresting characters, not making much sense, being ""stupid"", and the music.  I will address these first.  Guardians is not a perfect movie.  (Is there such a thing?)  There were some foolish points in the plot, such as why the prison guards fired their rocket launchers one at a time, at different windows, instead of unloading everything they had at one window and blowing both the guard tower and the Guardians themselves to smithereens. I also wonder, if the Infinity Stone is so sought after, why it was left completely unguarded on an abandoned planet, and that no one had stumbled across it until Quill found it, at which point everyone showed up for it.  I also wonder why Ronan sent just a handful of men for it.  If it was that important, I'd have brought my whole fleet for it.  Also, it doesn't make much sense to me that bloodthirsty, revenge-driven Ronan would allow himself to be distracted from his life's purpose of destroying Xandar by some idiot singing and dancing.  What did it matter what Quill was doing?  It would have taken just one movement of his arm and Quill would be no more, along with everyone else on the planet.  I also thought Yondu's destruction of all the Sakarran's was a bit unbelievable.  In the time it took that arrow to make its way around, SOMEBODY should have shot him.  Yet, these points don't detract from the movie in any significant way.  It is, after all, a work of fiction, and no good writer lets the truth get in the way of a good story.  I thought the character development was a bit shallow, but we did see all of the main characters grow and change a bit, even Groot, who saved the life of someone who had earlier tried to kill him and Rocket.  There was certainly a plot, and a fairly easy to follow one.  I liked all the characters, finding them believable and sympathetic. As for it being ""stupid"", that's a matter of taste. Some people like sci-fi, some don't.  I love it, if it's done right, which I believe Guardians was.  Yes, there's a sentient tree and a talking raccoon, but this is a work of fiction.  I find them no more foolish than vampires, werewolves, zombies, and people who can fly, shoot energy beams out of their eyes, and control the weather, which can be found in a number of blockbuster movies. The music was one of my favorite things about it.  I grew up in the 70's and 80's, and there wasn't a song on Quill's tape I didn't love.
  Now for the positive.  I absolutely LOVED this movie!  I thought it was one of the best I've seen in recent years.  It had humor, action, a decent, if somewhat clich plot, believable, likable characters, excellent acting and direction, and an alien version of Merle Dixon.  I half expected a green skinned Daryl Dixon to show up at some point.  I also liked all the little references to other Marvel movies and comics, and the scene with dancing baby Groot at the end was just awesome.  I also loved the way these diverse characters, who started out fighting each other, gradually became true friends, to the point where they were willing to die for each other.  It was that strong bond, and nothing else, which gave them the strength they needed to defeat Ronan.  I have no trouble giving this movie 5 stars, despite its flaws, because they are far outweighed by the positive aspects.  My advice, check this movie out if you haven't already.  Chances are you'll be glad you did, and if not, well don't watch it again, and let everyone know why.  I expect most will disagree.",1423612800,2,3901,4.499288762446657

It was a test for my 8 year old, though.  We don't use that kind of language, and I don't feel that it was artistically necessary.  Don't get me wrong, the language wasn't all that offensive, but what they did was just not necessary.  Cleaning it up would not have hurt the movie.

I have gotten a glimpse of the Star Lord character in various incarnations, and this one strikes some nice notes. All of the characters aren't bad company for this movie, and the tongue is planted firmly in the cheek. The movie makers strike a nice balance. Chris Pratt makes a fine Star Lord no one takes seriously, and who manages to rise to the occasion while still being a ""good-bad"" boy. The rest of the cast is perfect, and the CGI is nice.

I actually don't have that much to say here as I already stated my impression succinctly on my blog.  This movie is alternately intense and funny all the way to the end. The designs, graphics, and effects are brilliant even without a 3D screen.  The rogues turned heroes are memorable, bolstered by zingy dialog, even if Rocket Raccoon and Groot are the real highlights.

6911248,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Yes, although it is a movie based on a Marvel science fiction/adventure comic book, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (2014) is enjoyable!

It is funny in many spots and is genuinely touching in at least two scenes, where some thieving people and creatures (a walking, talking Ent-like tree named Groot and a brainy little talking raccoon named Rocket) put aside their worst selves and are willing to die with each other for a good cause (saving the galaxy).

I'd give the amusing film a ""B-"" overall, because I reserve ""A"" grades for films that seem really great to me ... such as CASABLANCA, THE LEOPARD, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, COOL HAND LUKE, THE MISSION, THE RIGHT STUFF, and MY FAVORITE YEAR. Of course I understand that madly in love FANS consider this a Five-Star ""A+"" Epic of Perfect Genius; I hope they in return can understand that not everyone is wired the same where perceptions and judgments are concerned.

POSTSCRIPT: As much as I may LIKE several parts of the film SHEENA (1984; staring Tanya Roberts), rating it AS a film I'd find it impossible to give it a grade higher than ""C+"". The only really touching scene was where Ted Wass's character, Vic Casey, is willing to sacrifice his life to save Sheena's ... which is VERY similar to the best moment of this film where Groot takes similar action!",1423353600,,1324,4.64957264957265

6911268,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie is fantastic.
If you are a super hero fan who is tired of the same stories being told over and over, this is the movie for you. The story is new, the actors/actresses are hilarious and engaging, the villains are malicious, the soundtrack is classic, and the setting/universe has some unique features. All of these variables are brought together into a familiar enough plot line that anyone (not just super hero regulars) can jump into it.

I am a marvel fan who has unfortunately not followed these characters much, but after seeing the movie I had to spend a few hours on Wikipedia learning more. The complexity and individuality of their backgrounds is rich, and you really get the feel goods from their coming together and fighting crime. It's exactly what a good action super hero movie is supposed to be.
Plus, it has my favorite scene from 2014 in.

I laughed, I cried, I seriously love this movie.",1423353600,,915,4.6770186335403725

6911272,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Didn't see this in a movie theater. I bought it based on overwhelming positive recommendation. Having now seen it on 2D blu-ray, digital and 3D blu-ray, I think the 3D version is absolutely the best viewing experience. Due to the shifting 2.40:1 / 1.78:1 aspect ratio, you are constantly brought in and out of the action in a way that is unobtrusive and downright fun. In fact, I find watching it in any other format not as enjoyable.

Unlike Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol, Tron Legacy, The Dark Knight and other popular titles produced for IMAX, the 2D version does not offer a shifting ratio. The Guardians 2D presentation remains 2.40:1 for the duration of the film. This means black bars remain on the top and bottom of your screen framing the picture. This purchase offers you a variety of viewing options, decide for yourself. It's worth the few extra bucks.",1423353600,,872,4.774834437086093

None are fatal flaws and the good in this film more than makes up for the bad. A hundred times over. This film is, quite simply, just fun. It's fun. It's a ride like we haven't had in movies for a while. And it holds up to repeated viewings. Pratt shines as the lead and the rest of the crew takes Marvel's riskiest gamble to date and delivers a stunning performance. I'll admit I was skeptical going in--a walking tree and talking raccoon?

Because of streaming services, such as Amazon's Prime Instant Video (Thank You, Amazon!), we don't buy many movies these days. And with 2 young padawan learners we don't re-watch so many non-animated movies. But the Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely an exception. It's whimsical, light-hearted charm makes this an easy movie to watch again and again.

6911472,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I absolutely love this movie.

Some people I talked to said that it was a little too corny, but honestly that's why I really enjoyed this film. Too many Superhero movies these days are dark and gritty and to be fair it's really getting depressing. There's a little bit of drama in the movie, but they never go too far with it like they did in C. Nolan's Batman movies to the point that it gets slow and drags on. This movie has a lot of slapstick moments, ""Avengers"" Style sarcasm, and the 1980s music that you see in the trailers has a purpose. They didn't just do that aimlessly. When you watch the movie you'll figure it out real quick.

The only thing I didn't like about this movie is (really a minor nitpick)the scene in the first 5-10 minutes. Before the opening credits start up. Now don't get me wrong it's not a BAD scene, it just sort of ends awkwardly. I couldn't even tell you if it was meant to be funny but failed; or if they were forcing too much back story into too short of a time. Either way it doesn't work for me.

Overall, a fantastic film. If you're looking for a Sci-fi adventure with comedy, drama, and intense action then this is the perfect film for you.",1422921600,,1181,4.263392857142857

6911529,2,B00R8GUXPG,Just not my kind of movie.,1422835200,,26,3.5
6911530,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Whenever a movie gets a huge amount of hype -- ""Titanic,"" ""Frozen,"" ""Avatar,"" ""Big Hero 6"" -- my first instinct is to cringe.  Inevitably, when I see a movie that is being hailed as ""the greatest movie ever,"" I feel like I'm being set up for failure.  Because all the praise and gushing about the movie builds my expectations up so high that, inevitably, I'll go see the actual film and be left with an incredible sense of letdown.  This is usually no fault of the movie itself, as some movies are genuinely good underneath the mountains of hype... it's just that sometimes you watch something expecting a masterpiece, and instead you get an ""eh, it was good I guess"" instead.  So I was understandably nervous about watching ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" which had been lionized as the best Marvel movie to date despite starring a cast of more obscure Marvel characters.

My final verdict?  ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is no ""Avengers,"" and doesn't quite live up to all the hype.  But it's not a bad movie, and is still a step above most brainless summer action movies... and its cast of quirky characters helps a great deal in that regard.

""Guardians of the Galaxy"" features Peter Quill a.k.a. Starlord, a galaxy-roaming criminal who was whisked off his home planet of Earth as a boy and whose taste in music is still lodged firmly in the '70s (despite being snatched from Earth circa 1986).  When his attempts to steal a strange orb go awry, he ends up in a high-security prison alongside a motley crew of fellow criminals -- Gamora, adoptive daughter of the supervillain Thanos, who wants the orb to fulfill her own mission; Drax, a powerful alien with no understanding of metaphor who wants revenge against Thanos' subordinate, Ronan, for killing his family; Rocket, an intelligent bioengineered raccoon with a penchant for gadgets and big guns; and Groot, a sentient and nearly non-verbal plant being who serves as Rocket's sidekick.  The unlikely group manages to escape the prison, turning the orb in to a being known as the Collector... who reveals that the orb contains the Infinity Stone, an artifact that can destroy entire worlds.  When the Stone falls into Ronan's hands, it falls on this band of misfits to retrieve the stone, defeat Ronan, and save the galaxy.

Yes, the plot sounds like it comes from an episode of ""Thundercats"" or the original ""Transformers"" cartoon.  It's pretty clich&eacute;, and the characters seem to know it and revel in it.  But the movie doesn't take itself deadly seriously, which helps to offset some of the cheesiness of the storyline.  This is a comic-book movie, after all, and with a few exceptions (such as the Christopher Nolan ""Batman"" films), most comic-book movies know that they're pretty much live-action cartoons and don't pretend to be anything else.  The story isn't Oscar material or anything groundbreaking, but it's enjoyable in its own right.

My main quibble with the story is that at times I felt like I had been dropped into the story without enough explanation -- like I was watching the second movie of a series without having seen the first.  I guess that's a typical hazard of a comic-book movie, though at least movies like ""Thor"" and ""Iron Man"" were self-contained enough that one didn't have to be familiar with the comics to understand what was going on.  ""Guardians"" felt like it was expecting viewers to have some prior knowledge of the comics going in, and that detracted from my viewing experience.

The characters largely save this film from being just another comic-book movie or a ripoff of ""Avengers""... mostly.  Peter Quill is an enjoyable character, an unlikely hero with his own quirks and flaws and a habit of rushing headlong into a situation and trusting on luck to carry it out.  Drax is pretty stoic for most of the movie, but his habit of taking everything literally makes for some of the film's most comedic moments, and it's hard to fault his reasons for seeking revenge... even if they get the group in trouble a time or two.  Rocket and Groot make a hilarious comedic duo, and were by far my favorite characters -- I wouldn't be surprised if they got their own spinoff movie somewhere down the road.  Gamora, despite her backstory and connection to the villain, was the weakest character in the lineup, the generic ""token action girl"" of the group with little personality of her own aside from being a ""troubled badass.""  For once could we get a female character in a superhero/comic-book movie who isn't just a generic action girl?  This is the same problem I have with Black Widow in ""Avengers,"" but that's a rant for another day.

And of course, the special effects are worth noting as well.  Nowadays it's almost impossible to look at a sci-fi movie and not draw comparisons to ""Star Wars,"" but I think ""Guardians"" manages to have a unique look that manages to avoid looking like a Star Wars clone.  The CGI was immersive enough that at times I could forget that I was watching computer animation, and the CGI characters (such as Rocket and Groot) melded with the live-action sets and characters enough that it honestly felt like the human actors were interacting with actual people and not pixels on a screen.  The best special effects, in my opinion, are the ones that let you forget you're watching Hollywood trickery, and this film managed to achieve it.

All in all, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a good movie, and well worth watching... but I hesitate to call it the best movie of 2014 (for me that's a toss-up between ""The LEGO Movie"" and ""How To Train Your Dragon 2""), or the best Marvel movie ever (for me that spot's reserved for ""Avengers,"" though that may change when ""Age of Ultron"" comes out).  It failed to live up to its considerable hype in my opinion, but then, it had been hyped up so much that there wasn't much chance of it doing that.  Still, I would definitely recommend this to people who like sci-fi, comic-book movies, or just action movies in general.  It's not a masterpiece, but it's fun, and that's what ultimately counts.",1422835200,,6046,4.743075453677173

I thought the movie was slow to get going, but when the action started, I enjoyed it. A ragtag bunch thrown together to save the universe-I felt there were a lot of missed opportunities for humor. The sci-fi graphics were good and but the character development was weak. The beginning of the movie made sense at the end of the movie and it ended leaving us with the feeling that there will be sequels, but that might depend on how much it pulled in at the box office.

6911582,5,B00R8GUXPG,"If you are looking to have the most fun at the movies that you have ever had, then going to go see Guardians of the Galaxy will be your best option. This is by far the funniest Marvel film to date. Peter QuillI mean Star-Lord (played by Chris Pratt) definitely draws the most laughs in my opinion, but the rest of the cast also has many funny moments throughout the film. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is one badass assassin, Drax the Destroyer is a very powerful being who has revenge only on his mind and he also is a very literal personnothing, including jokes, will ever go over his headbecause he has very long arms. Rocket and Groot (voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel) are in a way yin and yang. Rocket has a terrible attitude toward everyone while Groot has a soft heart for almost everyone, except for those trying to kill him and his new friends. From the very first scene that we are introduced to Groot, you immediately fall in love with him.

The visual effects are astonishing as wellespecially if you watch it in IMAX 3Dwhich this was the first time I have ever watched a film in IMAX and it was simply amazing. The soundtrack used was brilliant in that many of the people who went to watch this film was not even born, including myself, during the time that the songs were popular, so in effect, gives the audience something new to listen to in a more current action film. Star-Lords constant dancing will also brighten up some of the dark moments of the film as well. Chemistry among the Guardians is superb and even the villains show some pretty good chemistry together when they are in the same scene as well. Overall, one of the best movies of the year, but for me, I would still have to say that Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the favorite that I have seen so far this year. Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely number two though and I highly doubt that those two films will be moving from their current spots when all is said and done.

6911644,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I am a Marvel fan from the 70's and 80' and have enjoyed the Marvel movies (and yes, some of the DC ones as well) that have come to cinematic glory.  However, in most of them (HUlk, Thor, Captain America to name a few), outside of a bit of humor, most of the movies are serious.  Here we come to the Guardians of the Galaxy.  What do we see to start the movie?  The hero jamming to retro music on his Sony Walkman of all things.  Now, how the tape lasted so long (as did the Walkman as well) is a mystery for another story.  Here it opens up a movie, that while it has serious portent for the universe at large, for the viewing audience, there is so much FUN about this.  The actions scenes are just that, action scenes but lots of tongue-in-cheek humor that don't seem out of place in a universe where the venerable Walkman is still finding the AA batteries to run itself.

Yet, some of the biggest bang for the viewing buck comes not from the humans dressed up as aliens, but the very digital bytes that from the Racoon and ambling tree (Rocket and Groot).  Rocket is a wiseacre with a complex and Groot a trees with a limited but very expressive vocabulary (that Rocket translates..).

And, we do have personal agnst, team breaking and building moments, somber moments and many funny moments.  All done in a pretty fun format.

So, get yours, load up the popcorn and enjoy an instant classic.",1422576000,,1395,4.343629343629344

Lots of action, memorable characters, enough mystery for those like me who aren't familiar with the original comic books to want to see a lot more of these characters.

6911745,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I'm not sure which I'm reviewing, the movie, the quality of the DVD, the packaging or a little of all of them.  This is a ""product"" review, after all, but the phrasing is ambiguous.  So I'll do a little of all of them.

The movie is great.  Until you see an anthropomorphic racoon riding a ten foot tall anthropomorphic house plant spraying lead and screaming at the top of it's little (don't call me a rodent's) heart, you haven't really lived.  It answers the age old question of whether your greenery boogies down behind your back.  Blue Man Group makes a cameo (sort of), and green turns out to be sexy - and dangerous - on aliens other than Orion Slave Girls.  Gotta admit, the easter egg at the end is a bit of a head scratcher, considering how badly the movie of THAT particular Anatidaean Marvel ""superhero"" did, but it was right up there with the fun weirdness of the movie itself.  After all, if you don't have killer female androids on your rear, it ain't a movie worth watching.  This has enough eye candy for guys and gals - and action thrill seekers - to get diabetes and want to get it again.

If you want an honest review of it, go google ""Honest Movie Trailers: Guardians of the Galaxy"".  It helps if you've seen the movie before you watch that, though.  Do not be sipping anything while you watch.  It's funnier than hell and you might inhale at the wrong time.

As for the physical product, the DVD is a good investment.  It seems strong and sturdy.  The box is the usual DVD box, light weight and functional.  I imagine it's at least as durable and useful as a coaster as those old AOL CD's you used to get every three days in the mail (that assessment applies to both the box and the DVD).  I immediately ripped it to my home network and have it available for private home viewing, of course (that applies to the DVD, not the box).  I then tucked it away where it won't be disturbed until at least the next earthquake, wildfire or malicious act of God.  (That applies to the DVD.  The empty box went into the storage bin we have available for thieves who think they're getting our DVD collection if they steal it.  I hope people were taking notes.  There will be a test later.)

So, altogether it was an outstanding buy.  I'd definitely recommend the DVD because it's a quality media storage device and it's hard to watch the movie with out it, the box as a decent protective and DVD storage device AND the movie because it was a hell of a lot of fun to watch to everyone with a sense of humor who likes mindless action and (literally) out-of-this-world fun.  It's a definite must have movie for the collection.",1422316800,,2632,4.375257731958763
6911746,3,B00R8GUXPG,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun movie, but that's all it is, it's in no way an art house movie. It's just fun with a wise cracking raccoon. Other than that this movie does feel like they combined The Last Starfighter With Star Wars, with the only unique thing being the 70s era music. Most of the rest of the cast aren't that interesting and the villain is a weak attempt at a Darth Vader sort of bad guy.

It's an ok movie, you could do better, but you could do a lot worse.",1422316800,,476,4.010526315789473
6911747,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie was not on my I want to see and own it list.  But when I read the review of it on Hi Def Digest and they praised the movie and the 3D I had to see what all the fuss was about.  So I ordered it from Amazon and watched it one day with little expectations on my part.  Well.. all I can say is that sometimes we are blown away with some undiscovered treasure we stumble across.  I found out that I loved this movie.  It was funny and interesting.  It put my surround sound system to the test and had my buttkicker shaking and rattling me with the explosions.  The thing that got me the most was the 3D.  It is without a doubt the best 3D I have ever seen on any movie.  Avatar and Pacific Rim used to be my Demo Movies for my 3D TV.  My Oppo has really made movies, and especially 3D ones shine.  My brother commented that there was not ghosting whatsoever and that the picture was so clear it was like you were watching through a window.  If you have a good 3D TV with a great Surround System properlt set up, this is a fantastic movie to Demo your system, you may even find that it is one of your favorite movies.  I was glad to learn that they are planning a sequel... I only hope it is as good as the original and that Bradley Cooper and Dave Batista return in their rolls... as they both had me laughing at times....",1422316800,16,1328,3.984848484848485

I had absolutely no expectations going into it since I wasn't at all familiar with this part of the Marvel universe, but in the first ten minutes it won me over.  I love the characters, I love the story, I love the b@lls-to-the-wall, devil-may-care attitude and the sly, offhand humor.  I love the music!  This is odd because most of it was stuff I wasn't crazy about back in the 70s.

Guardians isn't just a goofy, good-natured romp, though, it's smart and it's savvy.  It hits all the right notes, walking a fine line between pleasing the long-time fans, and winning over people who have never opened a comic book.  (Okay maybe I'm overstating here.  There probably aren't any people on this planet who have never opened a comic book.)  One caveat: This isn't for kids.  Seriously, this is not a kids' movie in spite of the talking raccoon. There is nothing whimsical and sweet about Rocket, trust me on this.

6911816,4,B00R8GUXPG,"It's great to see a modern day matinee space comedy for people of all ages to enjoy. No bad taste scenes or discussions.  Just good clean fun. I was surprised, not only, how I enjoyed the film so much, but how the kids in my family took to the soundtrack so fast.

What was once considered dismissible seventies pop schlock and fluff, is actually coming back as enjoyable, optimistic pop music for all ages to enjoy. I've always loved these songs and when Rhino was releasing a CD collection like this one back in the 90's, I was in ""K-Tel Hell Heaven!"" I say ""K-Tel Hell"" because, back in the 70's, collections were released by a company called K-Tell that use to put alot of current pop hits on an album, but you were lucky to get maybe only a minute and a half of each song.

You see, back in the 1990's, Rhino Records released two similar pop collections of many of the seventies pop ""one hit wonders"". The collections were called ""Have a Nice Day: Super Hits of the Seventies"" (25 volumes of 12 songs each), and ""Didn't It Blow Your Mind: Soul Hits of the Seventies"" (20 volumes of 12 songs each)  I have all 45 of these CD's, and each one of them could be an additional volume to the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" music soundtrack. I think that they are probably out of print now, but some are still available if you look on-line. I've seen some at used CD stores but lately, I've seen them starting to disappear. I'll bet this movie got people running to the stores to look for other collections that have the songs you see and hear in this film. Rhino Records should re-consider re-releasing them all over again.

Anyway, the movie is great fun and I am so glad to see kids today recognizing how great the songs were from back in the 1970's.

I can't wait to see the sequel to this film and to see what other songs appear on Star Lord's volume 2 of his mom's ""Awesome Song Mix.""

BTW, it's amazing how his songs sound so good being recorded on cassette tapes. They must have been recorded on some pretty amazing cassette tapes. Better than Maxell and Magnavox because I wore out all my cassette tapes years ago.  LOL",1422144000,,2120,4.362944162436548

6911855,1,B00R8GUXPG,"I desperately wanted to like this film. But the many negatives so heavily outweigh the few positives, I can't.

The easiest way to sum it up is... I've seen it all before. I will be 68 in May. I read science fiction stories and novels as a kid, watched ""Star Trek"" and ""The Outer Limits"", on TV, and was thrilled by ""Star Wars"" when it opened. Fantasy and science fiction not yet having deeply penetrated popular culture, all had a degree of novelty. That is what ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" lacks. It hasn't an original idea in its head. And I don't think my less-than-sanguine reaction is the result of getting old and grumpy (though I am).

I doubt James Gunn was consciously copying -- any more than writing stories about hard-boiled detectives automatically plagiarizes Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler. But that doesn't lessen his responsibility to /try/ to find an original take on old ideas.

Watching ""Guardians"", my oft-repeated reaction was ""Oh, that's the [scene] from [movie]."" Screenwriters are oft-reminded there's only a certain number of basic stories. A movie has to find something novel in its treatment of tropes we're all familiar with. Gunn must not have been in class that day. (His writing has other failings -- notably having characters discuss things we've just seen. And he hasn't learned how to write terse dialog.)

And then there's the problem of tone. ""Guardians"" is both a farcical parody of comic books, and an attempt to tell a story about beings with real feelings. It's hard to get these to play together well. We're apparently expected to ""recognize"" characters from other films (eg, Rocket is Han Solo and Groot is Chewbacca), and thereby ""fill in the blanks"" this story leaves vacant. Perhaps if there had been fewer loud action sequences, there would have been more time to explore the characters and their relationships.

Tyler Bates' forgettable score does nothing to enhance anything about the film -- either its action sequences or tongue-in-cheek humor. It's easy to predict that Mr Bates will never write a classic (or even near-classic) film score. I urge him to study Bernard Herrmann's and Jerry Goldsmith's scores -- especially ""The Trouble with Harry"" and ""Gremlins"".

It is unlikely I will watch this film a second time.

ADDENDUM: I decided to watch a second time (on a 60"" plasma), demoting ""Guardians"" from two stars to one in the process. It's a loud, tedious, bore -- so annoying/boring that I gave up halfway through. It's a model of how eating snack foods destroys one's taste for meals with nutritional substance. I suspect Mr Gunn knows nothing but pop culture, never having read a good book or listened to good music. (Brahms' ""Song of Destiny"" is not only good music, but profound. ""The Pi&ntilde;a Colada Song"" is neither. Quill's mother had atrocious taste.) It is incomprehensible this film received so many favorable reviews, including one from the generally insightful Kenneth Turan.",1422057600,37,2953,4.9776876267748476

6911878,5,B00R8GUXPG,"First off, as my title implies this is a review of the 3D version of the flick. One thing that I found interesting about the home video version of the 3D version was that like Tron Legacy's 3D version the film was at certain points a different screen ratio. Sometimes the black bars would be there, others it looks full screen. This is to give us the feel of the Imax screening similar to the tf4 3D home video version and it is primarily for the scenes for when they're in space. as for my opinion, the movie is actually great. I found when I saw this in theaters to be a rather enjoyable flick.",1421971200,,596,4.191304347826087

  what a great entertaining movie.  chris pratt is a big time star, but still has the fun characteristics from parks and rec. he is just buffed up and has that star quality.  the plot was fun, the characters were a blast and it certainly was fun trying to match the voices with our favorite shows from other media.  nathan fillion??? ha... this movie should get the oscar for the best visual effects for sure... great movie and characters.  guardians part 2?",1421971200,,465,4.609756097560975

Guardians of the Galaxy is an exception. I had so much fun watching this one that I didn't want to be at the mercy of ever-changing lineups at the streaming companies. The action and humor are superb. The characters are a great mix of misfits. Now I just have to hope we get a sequel!,1421971200,,436,4.265060240963855

6911904,5,B00R8GUXPG,Love this movie wasn't to sure about it when it came out but changed my mind after watching it. Then I bought it.  Just wish it would have had a regular DVD instead of or as well as a 3D DVD. Since we don't own 3D DVD player and don't plan on getting one any time soon it is of no use to us. As far as the movie Guardians of the Galaxy my husband and I loved it.  We've watched it a dozen times since we got it a couple of weeks ago. Very entertaining has a little bit of everything in it.,1421884800,,489,3.6923076923076925

6911912,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie takes from the fringes of the Marvel universe and brings some crazy characters together to fight evil. It looked goofy to me and I had reservations about watching it, but gave it a chance and durn if it didn't make me a huge fan. I thought Chris Pratt was perfect for the goofball Star Lord. Zoe Saldana has made a living out of playing blue and green colored aliens. Rocket the Raccoon is a nice comic release, but I think Groot made me laugh the most. And what's to say about muscle bound Dave Bautista except ""dang I'm jealous"".

I hated the comics of Guardians of the galaxy but Marvel turned it into a well paced movie that had allot of back story to cover. Made my wife and Aunt laugh and cry.  Good solid humor without the cheese. I would give away the whole movie if I tried to just give you its high points.  I am anxiously waiting for the sequel.

 Zoe Saldana was HOT, funny and played her character very well!  Did I mention she was HOT!  Chris Pratt is in the spotlight now with his performance.  Dave Bautista made an awesome muscle bound butt kicker. Djimon Hounsou, awesome acting and will never be able to get out of my head ""WHO!""

6912015,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Some of the best fun you can have watching a movie.  Guardians of the Galaxy is a fast paced, well written and acted marvel comic book adaptation to film.  It really took some ""second string"" characters from the marvel universe and vaulted them right to the top.  The music soundtrack is great: the use of 1970's pop tunes serve as the main character's (Peter Quill's) touchstones to the life he had, the mother he loved, and what he left behind, and they move the film along in a way that will have you tapping your feet and singing along. (If you know the songs)  Can't recommend this one enough.  It'll probably become one of your favorites too.",1421712000,,648,4.504273504273504

For those of you who grew up in the 80's, I thought of the first scene with our anti-hero as a comic bit from the movie ""Heavy Metal."" This movie is not afraid to laugh at itself.

I had, and not long after the super depressing intro, this movie turns into the hilarious joke fest that I had been expecting, based on all the hype and reviews. It's definitely funny, and the characters are endearing (Groot's my favorite, but I've been a huge fan of Chris Pratt since Parks and Rec Season 1), which is more than enough to make up for the predictable plot which has been the same for every Marvel movie I can remember (evil guy with selfish motives strives to take over world or universe, and underdog good guys must pull together to stop him). The special effects in this movie are incredible, and I have to give a lot of credit to whomever designed the ships. It's hard to create something truly unique in sci fi/sci fantasy nowadays, but everything in this movie looks fresh. The air battles are truly amazing, and have to be seen on the big screen to be appreciated to their fullest. I can't wait for the sequel!",1421625600,,1104,4.443349753694581

It seems obvious that there was some major compression being applied. Pixelation was very bad on a 65"" screen. Surround was not good even though my receiver was indicating decoding. I have more invested in my sound and video than most people do in their cars (ashamed to say) and this was the worst quality streaming I have ever seen or heard. I watched 15 minutes and stopped it.

Update: Maybe this is due to my not using my PC to stream with. I am streaming with conventional WiFi enabled devices like my Blu Ray player. Here again, get with it Amazon.

It gave me no options to play it in plain Blu-ray or any other options. So I sent it back and ordered a DVD version. It might be a good movie, I don't know yet.

I will simply say that I completely enjoyed the movie. No, it isn't a perfect movie - but this isn't ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" it is strictly for fun, and yes, it was fun. Groot was my favorite character, the 'hero' not as fun to me as all the other characters, but still enjoyable. Overall, a nice way to spend an evening laughing. I look forward to the next!",1421452800,3,614,4.125
6912150,5,B00R8GUXPG,"The blu-ray package features both 2d and 3d, as well as a digital copy I put in VUDU and iTunes. Lots of extras. The movie fills out the 50GB disc (2D, no 3D TV) and looks incredibly filmic, with slight hints of crush on occasion in the intense darkness that often occupies scenes, though it's never distracting. Audio is top notch. Music often takes the sound stage by storm, and you wouldn't have it any other way with a soundtrack of this caliber. Every alien device sounds how you would expect, and it all roars, crashes, and zooms through the soundstage like it was really happening in the room. You might even be able to follow the whole film with your eyes closed, and very few can live up to that claim (Johnny Dangerously).

As for a review of the movie itself:
I found the trailers for this to be amusing. Good music choices for the trailers, too. I knew it was a comic book movie from the start, despite not having heard of it.

I had zero clue about any of the comic book lore, or the characters. I thought Rocket Raccoon was a Starfox knockoff. Not sure why I thought that, with Starfox being a fox, but he did nonetheless. Casting seemed okay. Dave Bautista never surprised me much in any role I'd seen him, and Chris Pratt just seems cheesy.

Then I started hearing a lot of positive reviews. I heard that Dave Bautista took acting lessons just to keep from looking like an oaf. I heard the name ""Star Wars"" and ""space opera"" more than once.

I was poised to see the Ninja Turtles movie, having been a childhood fan, but I wasn't entirely jazzed about the development. Then I started hearing such good feedback about Guardians, which settled the scales. All my friends and I went to the local movie house to see Guardians of the Galaxy.

I don't want to spoil the show, even though I can't help but want to really let go. The first thing that I noticed is the prominent role that music plays in the film. It really tugs my heartstrings. This isn't just a case of the right songs being chosen and edited into the right places; music is Peter's most beloved collection of memories of home. His connection to his mom. It's the only thing that he had to keep him from just being lost in space. Peter's passion for his cassette tape will bring you to tears, without any overt attempts to make you cry. In fact, most of the film is fairly straightforward and situational, and it's quite easy to suspend disbelief, because you see everybody as a real person (or creature) just doing what they do. There's nothing terribly supernatural about these heroes. They're really just a bunch of screw-ups and loners, and you just can't help but love them. They occasionally make bold moves, only to find out how small they truly are in the galaxy they live in, and yet they push on because nobody else is doing any better.

Ronan the Accuser might seem a bit intense and cliched, but he's The Accuser, and it just made sense to me that he'd be wordy and, well, accusatory in nature. It just made sense that way; he passes judgment on everybody, and it turned the cliche on its ear. Nebula took her daddy complex to the extreme, then showed her true colors by siding with whomever she felt was going to be victorious. Thanos hardly bats an eye at all this fuss, as if all this is below him. It is, and they are; he's merely biding his time before showing his true colors.

Drax/Bautista was brilliant. Hilarious. Groot stole more than his share of scenes, despite his very limited dialogue. Gamora was kind of dry, but it seemed more as if she was driven and focused than just poorly portrayed. Rocket showed layer upon layer of depth. Quill played off of all of them with a level of brilliance and realism that proved he was the glue that held them all together, time and time again.

I had no clue how emotional the ride was going to be. I laughed and cried, was shocked and amused; yet hardly ever where I expected to feel a particular feeling.

Guardians of the Galaxy is truly was the most wondrous adventure I've had since I saw The Empire Strikes Back. I felt like I was 5 again.",1421452800,25,4084,4.420212765957447
6912151,2,B00R8GUXPG,"This wasn't a horrifically awful movie, I probably would have given it a 3 if it hadn't been pushed so much as being awesome.

I'm not a comic book person.  Maybe if was I would be more forgiving about the storyline.

Honestly, for me the ONLY saving grace is the music.  If I had to write a one line description of this movie it would be ""a bunch of criminals got lucky.""  Yes, Hans Solo was a black market bootlegger, but he had some charisma and some character at the core.

I don't see it in this movie.  In the opening scene, the main character is jamming along to his mom's tunes and . . . just for fun . . . drop kicks an alien animal out of the way.  Is that supposed to be endearing?

It's just a bunch of chases and explosions . . . a video game on the big screen.  Maybe the reason that I don't like this movie is because that is all it is, and I'm not a gamer.  If you asked me to tell you the point of it all, I couldn't.

The one thing, and the ONLY thing, that I found interesting was that there is an End of Days reference and the main guy is supposed to be the ""son of God"" or that is the implication.  I've been seeing this across a lot of movies and shows, some in very odd ways, but the awareness is out there.

It's pretty sad when the only character that shows any nobility is a tree.

I wish I had rented this first before I bought it.  I don't think I will ever watch this again, I could barely sit through the whole thing the first time.",1421452800,2,1462,3.921768707482993

6912206,2,B00R8GUXPG,"This is easily one of the most overrated movies in the history of filmmaking.  The overall plot, while not bad, was generic to the point of absurdity.  It felt like a really bad episode of Thundercats or Voltron or some other random 80's cartoon, but with much better special effects.  The dialogue was utterly horrible and cliche.

As far as the acting went, the least painful performance was given by the CGI tree that only had one line that it kept repeating over and over (which, I admit, was a bit funny at times).  Dave Bautista should never be allowed in front of a camber unless a professional wrestling ring is involved.  Even Zoe Saldana, who I normally like, gave a performance that felt more wooden than Groot.  The rest of the cast, while not overly bad, certainly didn't provide anything that was particularly praiseworthy either.  The primary villain was incredibly generic and yet the actor managed to completely ham it up.

All in all, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a paint-by-numbers summer action flick with uninspired acting and ever worse dialogue that, for reasons unknown to me, was anointed by movie-goers as the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Personally, I would much rather stare at sliced bread for two hours.",1421366400,10,1241,4.838862559241706

6912293,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This is what a family movie is supposed to be like.  To say it had me laughing would be a misnomer.  I was snort-laughing.  The characterizations were awesome.

We learned a little about each character and understand each of their nuances long before they band together.  Knowing that we may know how and why they are together.

As with all Marvel movies, one of the fun things is to watch for Stan Lee in his cameo appearance.  Fortunately, this happens early.  Had it not, I'm certain I would have been too engrosed in the film to catch a glimpse of His Marvelness.

Guardians is fun.  There's do doubt about it.  This movie will be around for a good long time.",1421193600,,663,4.441666666666666

6912298,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I bought this movie because it was cheapest on Amazon even though I have no use for the 3D version. I don't think blu-ray makes a difference if your TV is less than fifty inches. The digital copy works with iTunes and several other providers.

The first time I watched this movie it felt a little bit cheesy, but after the second watch it didn't feel cheesy for some reason. The movie itself is a well made and interesting throughout. The soundtrack is an interesting take on the usual music in movies with lots of 80's music that works surprisingly well in this sci-fi movie. The plot is well made and evident throughout the movie and makes this movie a real winner. Without giving out spoilers; if you liked The Avengers you'll probably enjoy this film especially if you like music from the 80's. All in all this film is well made and worth the price.",1421193600,,853,4.467948717948718

As for the movie, I love it! It was very funny, a lot of the humor surprisingly sophisticated. You might need to brush up on your art history to get one of the funniest jokes in the movie. It was about very silly-looking aliens in space, but somehow the humanity of the movie made you forget that. Half the characters don't seem like you could relate to them at all at first, but halfway through you find you do. My first couple thoughts watching this movie for the first time were, ""I don't know if I can like any of these people enough to care about their story"", and ""It feels like a goofy 90's Jim Hensen movie, I don't think I can take this seriously"". But by the end of the movie, I decided it was one of my new favorites. If you like adventure, goofiness, moody bad guys, and silly-looking aliens in space, (or even if you only like one or two of those things!) a movie couldn't get any better for you than this one.",1421107200,,1136,4.14027149321267

6912432,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Mix three parts sarcasm, one part veritable and add a pinch of tree bark....Voila! Pure entertainment! Nice to see Marvel not taking itself so seriously this outing. The visuals in this movie are spectacular and the comedy is spot on. These characters are excellently portrayed by their Actors and Actresses. You easily are submerged in a world with no explanation but that doesn't matter. The background is only supplemental to the primary story narrative. Sit back grab some popcorn (Or whatever tasty treats you like) and have a good time. You will laugh, you will tense with excitement and in the end you will wish you knew what, ""a bit both!"" was.

Oh, the soundtrack I forgot to mention is truly deserving of its title, ""Awesome Mix 1"". Most music buffs have these songs already but if you don't get the sound track you won't be disappointed. This is one of the few times I can actually replay a movie in my head just listening to the arrangement of songs in their order.",1421107200,,977,4.6473988439306355

6912513,5,B00R8GUXPG,"My hat is off to the producers and director of this film. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the lesser known Marvel comic titles, and it has a strong tounge-in-cheek, doesn't-take-itself-too-seriously tone. When I saw the previews, I thought ""enh, that will be fun, but it's bound to be terrible."" I didn't think that it would be possible to translate the mashup of cosmic scale, sarcasm, and fun of the comic book to a movie without it feeling like a b-rate cheese fest. They pulled it off smashingly. Not only was it a great adaptation of the comic series, but it even ties into the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe fairly seemlessly.

This is actually a cut above many of the other Marvel cinematic adaptations. And the sountrack... Well let's just say there's a reason that Frozen was the only soundtrack that sold more copies last year.",1421020800,,846,4.677852348993288

I'm glad they used the music from the 70's, these are songs we all know and love and it hit the mark!!!

The movie has a bunch of comedic points throughout, although there are parts that might be a tear jerker.  This movie is one my favorite movies that came out in 2014 (the other being Big Hero Six).

The acting, directing, script, filming, soundtrack - really everything in this movie is done so well, it's my idea of a perfect film. It has the right balance of humor and emotion, character development, action, and stunning visuals. I'm sure Hollywood would like James Gunn to direct all movies from now on - and I think he's as capable as Joss Whedon and J.J. Abrams and other extremely talented, creative directors - but it almost feels as if he caught lightning in a bottle with this one.

I don't like ""Heroes"" to be villains, and at the beginning of the movie it's clear that none of them are good guys. I liked it better after awhile. I think it should have had more real heroes. It would have been better if they'd stuck more to the comics' versions. Any of the versions. I would have liked to have seen Adam Warlock, Captain Marvel, Nova, Quasar, Silver Surfer, Major Victory or Starhawk.

Chris Pratt and Dave Bautista are the saving grace of this movie. Both are hilarious and were the main reason I continued to watch to the end.

I don't know who likes the music but I'm deducting one star for the music choices in the movie. With all the great music to choose from the movie uses stuff I forgot existed. I was expecting Steppenwolf and Led Zeppelin but got what I would call Lame disco instead. Vin Diesel ? I guess he deserved credit for wearing a body suit covered with sensors so they could map the CGI onto his character Groot but only two lines ? I am Groot and we are Groot ? Sorry Vin.

The character development doesn't really involve me with the movie enough. I enjoyed the genetically enhanced Raccoon ""Rocket"" the most and that doesn't say much for the non CGI stars of the movie.

I still have to rate MIB 3 as a lot better. Maybe this will be one of the movies that has a sequel that's better than the first movie.  One can only hope so.",1420761600,,927,4.167597765363128

6912769,5,B00R8GUXPG,"When this movie first came out I was like, why and what?  I didn't bother going to the theater to see it.  I'm sorry but the studio did not promote it right.  My son begged me to see this so I rented it on Amazon and WOW what a GREAT choice!  1st of all, the music from the 70's and 80's blew me away and gave me some great memories!

The movie is a huge fun ride!  Groot is so loveable and adorable and Drax, OMG what can you say about him, ""You are in imbecile"" STILL cracks me up (as I've watched it about 4 x since renting it).  Peter is an unlikely hero because of who he grew up surrounded but you can see he needs friends.  And anybody would love to have a friend like Rocket, can do anything electronical.  Gamora.  Well we have seen Zoe kick butt as herself, as a blue person and now as a green person.  What color can't she play and kick ass?

There are so many parts that I enjoy in the movie I just can't name one.  I will say the end with Peter and Ronan confront each other, the dance off is hilarious because Ronan is confused and helpless to defend himself because of it.

To find out, as the movie plays out, Guardians of the Galaxy, is part of the Marvel Universe and somehow Thor, Avengers were connected made me want to watch but as usually you can watch each Marvel movie without having to watch any other.  The writers, producers are doing a great job keep each movie separate and yet equal to each other as far as action, adventure, storyline, etc.

As I'm enjoying the entire series of movies that they are doing now and the connections and I can't wait until the next Guardians comes out.

My only question is, who isn't in a Marvel movie?  Glenn Close was a pleasant surprise.",1420761600,6,1702,4.152905198776758

Why the 4 stars? Audio quality. I own the Blu-ray. Watching this and other sci-fi movies back to back on the same system at the same volume, it becomes clear this movie has some audio fidelity issues. Highs aren't as crisp, lows aren't as deep. The movie lacks an audio presence, and feels flat. Nothing really pops. Which is a shame, because this movie has some truly magical sci-fi moments.

I've watched the movie about a dozen times now and I certainly enjoy it, but I was hoping for a light and sound extravaganza. There are lesser movies that make me laugh out loud with giddy ""it sounds so good"" joy.",1420761600,,690,4.512

The film contains a solid mix of action and comedy. Chris Pratt is starting to emerge as actor to be reckoned with. I, like many, was unfamiliar with the Guardians storyline from the comic. However, I was pleasantly surprised and found the storyline to be quite enjoyable.

6912829,5,B00R8GUXPG,I purchased this for my 9 year old son because he kept raving about the movie and wanted us to see it as a family. The movie is very entertaining for the kids (I also have an 11 year old daughter who enjoys it) but there is some inappropriate language. I didn't realize I bought the 3D/Blueray version. We don't have a 3D compatible TV so I can't speak to the quality of that disc.,1420675200,,381,4.093333333333334
6912830,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I have seen this movie 3 times at the theater and liked it better each time.  To be honest, I have been a fan of Chris Pratt since Everwood, but I never knew he had this kind of talent.  I thought of him more as a character actor, but he is definitely leading man quality.  He truly owned this movie and played his character flawlessly.  I never knew anything about this comic and have never read one, so I don't know if it follows the storyline in the series or not, but the story was truly outstanding.  What really is astounding to me is how much the music contributed to my enjoyment of the movie.  I am old enough to remember everyone of the songs in his mother's tape she gave him for reasons I won't divulge.

I am not going to reveal anything about the storyline because it would reduce your enjoyment of the movie.  If you rent it, I will be surprised if you don't buy it.  It starts out when Chris is child and at a very critical time in his life and from beginning to end it is full of surprises and just completely immerses you with in sound and story.  You will LOVE it!

6912834,2,B00R8GUXPG,"What to say about this movie that exemplifies the very worst of Marvel comics culture and characters.  I cant understand the praise thats been put its way.  Stupid ideas and names, confusing plot, cheap use of baby boom soundtrack. Ronan, who was a dignified adversary from the Fantastic Four comic, is here reduced to a rebellious monomaniac with poo smeared on his face. Maybe not as mixed up as Thor 2. Maybe not as embarrassingly bad as Iron Man 3. Given the scrawled-on-a-napkin-by-idiots nature of the components, the technical masterminds have assembled about as good a product as could be achieved.  Seems to be liked by the worldwide public; then again, maybe Idiocracy is coming to pass in general. However, its still trash - sorry.",1420675200,2,742,4.92

6912916,1,B00R8GUXPG,"My husband and I enjoy Marvel movies, so when Guardians of the Galaxy came out, we decided to see it.  It was the biggest waste of time we've spent on a movie in a long time.  The ""heroes"" are crude and self-centered, and they do good but they aren't good at their core.  They're almost proud that they might do good or evil (one of the last lines in the movie this was said by the characters).  We're used to how heroes nowadays are imperfect (Tony Stark) versus yesteryear's ""perfect"" heroes (Superman).  But the ""heroes"" in this movie are nowhere near the definition of ""hero"".  Sure, the special effects are good, but that was the only thing that was good in this movie.  We hope this isn't the new trend in Marvel's hero movies.",1420588800,12,733,4.425373134328358

6912935,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Guardians of the Galaxy has to be one of the best pure escapism films to hit the big screen since the original Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Both of those movies you could see over and over and over again and still have fun watching them. Guardians is much the same way - the story is so wildly funny, quirky and with some off-beat humor that a repeat watching is still enjoyable. It's why I purchased the DVD. And for those on some far away alien planet who don't know - at least the theatrical version had a rather cute and quirky ""Easter egg"" at the very end of the credits as a certain duck pays a visit.",1420588800,,617,4.107438016528926

I thought it was generic and derivative at best with annoying characters. Since I bought the darn thing I decided to force myself to watch it again. Maybe I was just in a really bad mood the first time around because the second time I watched it I loved it. I think I already had some preconceived notions of how certain characters would act and they didn't. Anyway, the second time was the charm.

6913346,4,B00R8GUXPG,"One of the kids in my family has declared this movie to be the best movie ever made.  This reviewer disagrees, but the movie is entertaining.

This movie doesn't focus on the continuing adventures of the Guardians, instead it focuses on the building of the team itself.  Each character has a different strengths and weaknesses and the characters use their strengths and weaknesses in combination to gain the Infinity Stone.

The movie has excellent special effects, good acting, and is a triumph of the imagination, but it lacks an adult depth on weightier matters such as the ideas in the Batman or Superman Universes.",1420502400,,619,4.923076923076923

But other than the things I mentioned in the third sentence and the music, the film is just okay.  It will not be that memorable to me as a great sci fi film.  Also,  Batista can not act.

6913422,5,B00R8GUXPG,"As a long-time fan of the Marvel comic universe, I am still shocked that a title as far from mainstream as GoG could have succeeded so well as a film. Prior to Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning's remake of the Marvel cosmic universe (variously inhabited by Silver Surfer, Nova, Adam Warlock, and the Inhumans), the idea of a Marvel cosmic ensemble film seemed almost crazy.

However, there is a superb balance of humor, action, and gravity that is exactly what I love about the comic. Although this iteration of Peter Quill is a bit of a jackass, his actions do matter. This version of Drax is a bumbling fool, but he remains heroic. The plotting was great - 75% of a ""getting the band together"" story and 25% of a succeeding against all odds tale.

Without question, this will fit brilliantly into the Marvel cinematic universe quite well. One could imagine Iron Man, S.H.I.E.L.D., the upcoming Captain Marvel, and, certainly, the Avengers interacting with this group. Well done, once again, Marvel Studios.",1420416000,,1002,4.819767441860465

6913425,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This film comes from Marvel, the makers of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Avengers. A ragtag and almost humorous small group of misfit heroes must fight for their lives against an army of very powerful aliens. A man renamed Starlord who is from Earth originally is now a very good space pilot, much like Han Solo from Star Wars. Then there is Rocket, a raccoon that has been modified to have human intellect and speech but that does not change his animal lust for war! Imagine Wolverine trapped in a raccoon's body. Groot, a rather strange being, is like a tree come to life with brutish yet human intellect. Gamora(not the giant turtle) is most similar to Dark Angel starring Jessica Alba. Imagine a super ninja or the Black Widow with Captain America's strength and you understand why Thanos wants his own relative dead! Then there is Drax, the most dangerous of the group. Drax in the comics was like a Klingon on the warpath but with the strength of the Thing or Colossus(about 70-85 tons benching). Although not as strong as Thor or Ronin the Accuser, Drax still makes up for it in sheer ferocity! Now they must fight to save the universe from Thano's minions. Thanos is like a god in power level on a par with Odin or the Stranger. Thano's main minion called Ronin the Accuser is who the Guardians must fight in this movie. They soon find out that Ronin is everything they were warned about! However, Starlord might be hiding something about his past. Something even he does not fully know or understand yet. Something that just might be the Guardians only chance at beating Ronin and saving everyone! OUTSTANDING CGI. Some of the best special effects of any film I have ever seen! ANY. One of the best soundtracks I have ever heard! If you like classic rock, you will love this! There is also a surprisingly large amount of comedy in this film as well. Chris Pratt plays the role of Starlord. Zoe Saldana(Columbiana, Uhura) plays Gamora. Dave Bautista(Riddick, WWE) plays Drax the Destroyer. Vin Diesel(XXX, Fast & Furious, Riddick, Pitch Black) does the voice for Groot. Bradley Cooper rounds out the cast doing the voice for Rocket the Raccoon. Included in the bonus features is an exclusive look at the new Avengers film coming out soon called Avengers:Age of Ultron when the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver join the Avengers team! Rumor has it that Captain America is killed in Age of Ultron and replaced by the Falcon who then starts wearing the Captain America uniform(with the wings too?). No certainties when it comes to rumors however. Guardians of the Galaxy is not quite as good as Avengers or The Winter Soldier but the CGI I feel is actually better in Guardians of the Galaxy than all other Marvel films.

This is a family movie that everyone can enjoy.  Chris Pratt gives a career making performance and Dave Bautista shows how a physical monster can also be an intellectual.  If you want to watch a positive, success oriented, life affirming movie, this one is for you.  It was the top money maker for 2014 and that success was deserved.

All of the actors excel in their quirky roles as a misfit group of opposites coming together to take down a genocidal mad man. The heart of the film, though, is the computer generated Groot, who made me pause the film from laughing so hard twice. If epic space-fantasy hurts your head with all the names of planets and people to remember, rest assured that this film does not require you to memorize an encyclopedia of alien cultures. Careful with the really little ones, as there are plenty of sexual innuendos, some light swearing, and mildly graphic violence throughout.

6913584,4,B00R8GUXPG,"This is a very good, somewhat different comic book world movie.  I liked it.  I liked it a lot.  But I can't give it a fifth star.  And this review is going to mainly explain why.  First - Disclaimer:  I watched this movie streamed from Amazon via a Roku device at home on a large screen TV, so it might have lost something compared to seeing it in a movie theater.  First, the soundtrack is not optimized for a TV, the music and the sound effects are way too loud and he dialogue is often muddled and inaudible in comparison. Those are technical issues, and it's unfortunate that soundtracks can have various sound options using the methods (Roku and Amazon Prime) that would help optimize it for non-surround systems and simply using the TV speakers.  Now for the movie.  Some people are raving about this, and it doesn't merit raves, but it's still solid entertainment and very creative. Clever at times, and has some new-ish elements to it.  But the story is still full of gratuitous action and fight scenes.  I'm not against them, just de-sensitized to them.  They've become boring at this point.  There is really no drama when you know that your main character isn't going to exit the movie.  I would've fast forwarded through the action scenes if I thought I wouldn't miss any plot elements, and the noise and flash of these scenes, and there are way too many of them and as a viewer I begin to feel browbeaten by them.  Yes, you have great CGI, yes you can make great CGI fight scenes, you've proven that.  Now show me something else.

Look, I liked the movie, it's a lot better than a lot of the garbage being put out these days and I will certainly see the sequel, but it bothers me that this could've been a whole heck of a lot better with some editing, throttling back on the pandering to the lowest common denominator, and a bit more intellectual creativity.  All of the previous suggestions would make the great CGI, the excellent fight scenes and the cool new comic book world pop even more.",1420416000,,2006,4.494475138121547

6913589,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Really well done. I have to give it four stars because the concept and the special effects were amazing, but the storyline was predictable and the writers seemed to have a problem deciding if this was a kid's movie, or an adult movie. It really needed to be one or the other. Guardians could have been a very cool adult movie, with characters who were more complex and a storyline that was less predictable.",1420416000,,407,4.513513513513513

If Marvel usually takes its movies a bit too seriously for you, this is the one that doesn't.  The music is another big plus, fun tunes from (if your my age) your past.

Now I can wait patiently till the next episode in 2017.",1420416000,,408,4.1265822784810124

But srsly though, this was a cute movie with enough action and emotion to keep me entertained the whole way. I never read the comics, so I was bit worried that I wouldn't be able to follow along or get all the jokes, but the movie was solid all around.

The filmmakers did a wonderful job with the sound editing, imho. My favorite part was in the beginning when Chris Pratt is doing his Indiana Jones thing while doing singing along to one of his walkman tunes. Seriously creative and instantly one of my fav scenes.",1420416000,,528,4.3232323232323235

I saw it with 3 others in my living room and it did have that certain 'movie magic' that appealed to each person watching.  It had that 'fun' part of the first ""Star Wars"" movie and the classic 'good vs. evil' plot along with pretty cool CGI.  The characters were jocular and the actors gave forth life to them.

Villain is yet again rather underdeveloped, and it is pity to see that Chris Pace's and Karen Gillan's talents aren't used better.

6913906,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Great movie! I thought some of the characters were a little one-dimensional (Gamora, Drax). I get that Drax was supposed to be a bit simple. Gamora had pretty much no personality, even for someone who was supposed to have no personality. I also thought that Gamora was very underpowered. Almost everything she tried to do in the movie failed, and for a galaxy-class assassin it seemed like her movements were slow and fighting ability mediocre. Otherwise, stunts were amazing, dialogue was very entertaining, Groot is the best character (of course), good movie for kids.",1420329600,,570,5.074468085106383

I'm not a huge fan of movies that love to show off variations of aliens (blue skin, red skin, weird looking creatures, etc), but I do love a good sci fi movie.  This movie has an irreverent and funny tone; doesn't take itself too seriously, and keeps the plot moving.  Excellent first half.  Wanes a bit in the second half (shoot 'em up, the some more shoot 'em up, then some more...).  Fun ride, worth it.

6914113,3,B00R8GUXPG,"I heard all the hype when this was in the theaters so I was expecting more.  Most of the popular Marvel characters came around after I quit reading comics so younger people may have a different take on the movie than I do.  A varied group of individuals, each with a special talent, unwillingly form an alliance to insure their own survival and end up as a team fighting against an arch villain that wants to take control of the ""galaxy"".  Special effects are well done as is to be expected with CGI.  Some of the conversations are quite cerebral and unexpected for a movie such as this.  There is humor as in the other Marvel movies along with the obligatory bit part by Stan Lee and one last scene after all the credits run but I haven't a clue what it was about.  If you are a Marvel fan I'm sure you will like this movie.",1420243200,,825,4.222929936305732

We are both older nerds who grew up on Nintendo, Star Wars and Comic Books, so this was up our alley.

I understand that that's kind of the theme of the movie, but seriously.  This movie, all by itself, had at least 3 of the most awkward scenes in any movie ever.  The 70's music just adds to it.

Nonetheless, this movie is worth it for the laughs and action.  Actually, it's worth it just to see the evil villain in action.  That actor should get an academy award.  He exhibited an amazing variety of evil drama queen pouty expressions throughout the movie.  It was awe inspiring.",1420156800,,597,4.514018691588785

Basic alien-abduction, dumb-guy-becomes-hero, and intergalactic adventure movie.  (Just check the movie's website and previews.)

Excellent CGI and digital work.  The voice talent does well (Vin Diesel as a talking tree with a three-word vocabulary is funnier than you think.)

Wife and kiddos approve.  And it's funnier after the second (or third) viewing as you pick up small elegant touches that were built in to the movie.",1420156800,,499,5.0

I happen to love comics (and Marvel comics in particular), but this is a movie for everyone. I know so many people who put off watching it just because it was ""one of those comic movies,"" but once they finally saw it they were in love. I saw this in the theaters opening week, but I just had to ring in my New Year with this movie.",1420156800,,500,4.387096774193548

I am amazed that I wasn't turned off by the raccoon. Thought he was going to be cheesy but ended up being my favorite character. Vin diesels acting in this movie was amazing and to the caliber of his acting ability. The way he made me feel that he truly was groot, well my words wouldn't convey the true power of it. His voice training and the true no auto tuned voice corrected infliction made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. I truly see an Oscar in his future.",1420156800,,611,4.0578512396694215

6914430,3,B00R8GUXPG,The movie had moments that were funny and clever but overall it was very predictable and focused on action over story (always a bad sign). There were several enjoyable and memorable characters (Groot) and the actors did a pretty good job. Lots of CGI and battle scenes for those who enjoy that sort of thing. But most viewers are now well past the gee whiz stage of what can be accomplished with CG and want story to accompany the images. The backdrop music includes favorites from the 70's (Cherry Bomb by the Runaways and others) was a nice diversion. The intentional mismatch between the songs and images was very intriguing. Overall-glad I rented it. Probably would not see it again.,1420156800,11,687,4.733333333333333

My only complaint is about James Gunn and his refusal to include Richard Rider, the Earth man Nova who played a pivotal role in the comics.

6914540,3,B00R8GUXPG,"A boring movie, and not worth the money. The humor was juvenile at best, and outright boring at worst. Save yourself some money and see Spaceballs for free on Prime.",1420070400,,165,4.533333333333333
6914541,2,B00R8GUXPG,"Lots of action but the movie never engaged me.  I didn't care about the characters or the orb.  The movie was not able to create empathy for any character except Quill.  There is minor humor in the movie.  The different planets are so odd and there are too many and, you don't care about those either.  The music was the best part.  I got bored and did my nails.  I finished watching it because I paid for it. It was mediocre at best and I expected more and was disappointed.",1420070400,6,475,4.211111111111111

6914557,2,B00R8GUXPG,"Two stars for the effects and the imaginative worlds but other than that, this movie is over the top, sappy and dumb. It has some funny moments but they really try too hard with the dialogue and the acting. Chris Pratt is an obnoxious little boy with too much screen time and the makeup effects are pretty bad. Story needs some work, a few of the characters were fun and interesting with the exception of the cheesy ending. Worth watching ONCE and then never again. Even then, you might want to be doing something else while you watch it, like cleaning the house or something.",1420070400,,576,4.495238095238095

6914573,5,B00R8GUXPG,"For fans of the Marvel universe this obscure title will be a pleasant surprise.  As a kid who grew up in the 60's and 70's this was not a comic book of my era.  Regardless this was a fun movie that really was what the 3 Star Wars sequels could/should have been.  Chris Pratt who never really impressed me on Parks & Recreation shines as the star of this show.  You know when the opening sequence features an ""Awesome Mix Tape"" playing the Blue Swede remake of B.J. Thomas' hit ""Hooked on a Feeling"" you are in for a different Sci-Fi adventure.  Bradley Cooper voices a talking raccoon with a surly attitude so much more enjoyable than his over the top turn in American Hustle.  Zoe Saldana is turning playing weird aliens into a habit but she's good at it.  Vin Diesel is credited as the animated tree creature Groot who has only one line repeated through the film ""I am Groot"" which sounds dumb and uninteresting but really captures the audience's admiration.  Let's face it, on the surface the Wookie from Star Wars didn't sound too appealing either but you warm up to the big lug when it's all over.  Clearly a sequel is in the works and I'll look forward to seeing it.  We viewed the 3D version and thought it was a good experience.",1420070400,4,1236,4.405286343612334
6914574,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Really love this one, but there's more ""adult theme"" material that I feel comfortable with for me to feel great about letting my kids watch it.  Detracted a bit from the gratuitous violence.  Yeah, PG-13 for a reason.",1420070400,,217,4.684210526315789

6914713,5,B00R8GUXPG,There is a reason this was the number 1 movie of 2014. Great action. Great humor. I fell in love with all of them.

Good space fantasy flick very much in line with what a 12 year old.  Space, fighting (but not too much to detract from the story line), ""bad guys"" that are really good guys.  Shows how teamwork and friendships can be built out of hatred or distrust.",1420070400,,407,4.113924050632911

I really enjoy a well made fantasy movie and this was just that.  I am not going to go into the storyline but I will comment on the good production values.

6914744,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Fantastic visual effects and great acting by all cast members.  Even ""Rocket"" was a hoot!  Love Marvel's television series also.  This is a perfect example of how entertaining a movie can be,  full of action and a decent plot (it is science ""fiction"" after all), and not have one four-letter word in the entire script.  I now wish I had seen it in a movie theater, especially the 3-D version!  Downloading to Kindle and having 3-day rental for $4.99 was well worth it as I watched it twice!  Once was able to plug Kindle Fire HD to TV with the mini-HDMI cable available through Amazon and watched that way as well as on Kindle alone away from home.",1419984000,,648,4.440677966101695

6914748,5,B00R8GUXPG,This movie surprised me....I'm a big SciFi and Fantasy fan but I don't know why i just expected this to have been rushed or not that good but i was wrong about that....it was excellent.  For sure worth seeing more than once.,1419984000,,224,4.333333333333333

6914751,1,B00R8GUXPG,"""stick up your a$$?""  ""pelvic sorcery?""  Great for kids, eh?  I am a marvel fan and love eye candy.  Unfortunately, in this movie the script is utterly childish and full of cliches.  I don't mean it's written for children, it's written by children.  Everyone in the ""gang"" talks like they are the toughest and exert nothing but attitude...no humor.  I find them to be unbearable bores. There's plenty of fit throwing, yelling, whining and arguing from almost all the characters. Great for kids, eh?  And then their is the obligatory cocky wise-cracking smart alack with attitude and cliches.  And really, what is so cute about small terrestrial creatures ""cock-fighting"" for entertainment and gambling?  Again, great for kids, eh?  Very disappointing. This is not the kind of rating I like giving to Marvel movies, but this one really bored me.  I forced myself to watch the whole thing hoping for something redeeming.  It didn't help.

Also, much of the picture is dark, not a lot of light.  I don't care for any picture that keeps one literally in the dark so much.",1419984000,11,1067,4.81767955801105

6914756,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I didn't expect anything from this movie, I really thought it would suck.  But I was very pleasantly surprised, this is a great movie.  Throw in the weird (but great) 70's soundtrack, some incredible cgi, and some really well rounded characters and you got a fantastic movie.  To top it off, the one guy I really thought was stupidly defined, Ronin (the villain) died at the end.  Much more interesting was his boss, Thanos.  Anyway, this was an ""eye-candy"" movie and it didn't disappoint in that regard, it was visually stunning!  The plot was contrived and overly complicated, but the character development made up for it.  Really, the most outright enjoyable movie I've seen since the first Transformers movie.

And for the record, I think every Transformers movie since the first completely sucks.  Let's hope this start doesn't tail off so quickly.",1419984000,,853,4.950704225352113

6914948,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Before I saw this I simply figured that I'd ""like"" it. In the sense that I wouldn't mind sitting still for a couple hours. I knew that Marvel knew how to write for many big characters (too bad we can't say that for Sony) and do it pretty well. But I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. This is now one of my favorite movies of all time. If the talking raccoon, the walking tree and the green chick weren't enough to tip you off that this isn't supposed to take itself seriously....it's not. Nevertheless this movie is cleverly peppered with perfectly timed moments where it DOES indeed take itself seriously and causes some introspective wonder. The cast all did great, all of them. The writing was clever and fun and upredictable at times. The score to the film is fantastic, while also adding a wonderful playlist of 1970's era poprock music that really give this space opera some hometown flavor! I freaking love it. I've watched it about 10 times since it came out and I watch the whole thing with a smile on my face everytime. Not many movies do that for me.",1419984000,,1073,4.507692307692308

I will spare you a gushing movie review, as I am sure anyone reading this has read a million of them. The movie plot deviates from the comics, but that is no great surprise, most of the Marvel movies so far have deviated from a direct comic book translation (but this has resulted in some great movies). If you are a Marvel fan, this movie is a definite must own.",1419984000,,491,4.020408163265306
6914976,5,B00R8GUXPG,"IMO, this was the most surprising and most entertaining big movie of the Summer! The whole move topped the Avengers for looks, script, and overall entertaiment factor. I know almost nothing about the Guardians in comic book form, so I was a blank slate and sort of trepedatious about seeing it in the theater. In short, hands down a wild ride delivering everything you could ask for in this type of movie and more!",1419984000,,414,4.608108108108108

6915009,5,B00R8GUXPG,"The most refreshing movie of 2014! Not one of the more recognizable characters of the Marvel universe, but as with everything, with good writing and scenarios and great cast, it was surprised hit! Launching into the cosmos, you see it through the eyes of Peter Quill, half human, half alien, he was kidnapped when he was a kid and raise by a band of space pirates. He later became one himself and is how this story develops. His adventures includes, running from madmen who wants his bounty, recruiting a crew to help him in his quest to save the galaxy from a despot who wants to destroy it. Technically, it's a step above all others, Colorful scenarios, highly detailed worlds, varied landscapes, ships that only exist in the minds eye. The Blue-Ray transfer is top notch, HD audio is awesome! It comes with extras that complements the story and enhance it, not to mention a sneak peek at Avengers 2! Highest possible recommendation!

All of the cast is good, so many deadpan delivery's (""I am going to die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy""-Soldana)  to emotions like Rocket saying in frustration "" You're. making. me. kick. grass!!!""
Its a fun movie, I think it would be just fine for older children...its one of the few movies that I remember in years that made my nephew laugh out loud and more than once. (younger ones usually like animations and a lot of the humor would go over their heads).",1419897600,,741,4.613636363636363

6915042,5,B00R8GUXPG,The most fun I had at the movies in 2014.  Honestly don't know what I can say about this unexpected Marvel hit that hasn't already been said before. If you like Science Fiction ala Star Wars mixed with a dash of comedy then this movie should be in your collection. The extras are standard behind the scenes documentaries and gag reels that never seem to be as long as I wish they were. The picture is pristine and the sound is crystal clear and immersive through our home theater speakers.,1419897600,,489,4.433333333333334

6915044,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I went and saw this three times in the theater, twice with the Bride. It was just a heck of a lot of fun for everyone, even with some of the mildly vulgar language involved. The soundtrack was a rocking lot of fun and supported the action in the movie for me. The CGI was awesome all the way around and was part of the story rather than something that took you out of it. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have suggested it to many, many folks. I have a decided trend to only review stuff I find to be four or five star, the rest I'm just not that interested in rehashing the experience. This movie is definitely in the uber five star category for me.

6915050,5,B00R8GUXPG,"What can I say, it blows away ""The Avengers"" in my mind.  The humor, music, action and the character depth was great.  The background story of each character was known and it didn't take 30 minutes to give you an idea about why they behaved the way they do.  Great visuals and tech in the movie and there were no eye-rolling characters or scenes.

This movie translated great to the small screen; whereas I thought that ""The Avengers"" was way less impressive (well, I thought it was mediocre) on the small screen.",1419897600,,513,4.543478260869565

6915070,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I have to admit that I had my doubts about this from the get-go. Ever since Disney absorbed Marvel comics into it's ever- broadening quest to become THE ONLY media empire in the galaxy, adaptions of Marvel comic books have been shooting out faster than one-liners from Stan Lee, and the result has been mindless QUANTITY (explosions, bloodless battles, more explosions, more battles and on and on and on ad nauseum...) instead of quality. (character development, suspense, an absorbing storyline.) The only holdouts have been the X-Men films (20th Century Fox) and the Spiderman films (Columbia/Sony) , which have been good, although the last Spiderman movie sucked.
So imagine my surprise when along comes this totally delightful film about the adventures of a group of 3rd stringer Marvel characters that only those of us who have been around a while vaguely remember. And perhaps that's the reason this film does so well - there are no big preconceived notions about how they should translate from comics to film. There is plenty of spectacle, to be sure, but the writer, editor and director wisely knew how to keep certain action sequences from going on interminably long. (which is my main complaint about the current crop of Marvel films-just how much can you take of Marvel characters fighting alien forces, or each other? When a so-called ""action sequence"" begins to put you asleep because there's just no end to it, there is definitely something wrong.) GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY takes you into one situation, and then wisely moves on to a break and then onto the next while in between, wwe're introduced to the totally delightful band of misfits, and some very interesting and quirky side characters. The pacing in this movie is spot-on, liberally dosed with humor to keep the boredom factor down, and to actually make you care about what happens to our heroes. Let's face it-the effects people have the whole CGI universe down to a fine science - unlike some other filmmakers, the creators of G.O.T.G. know when to give us the pizzazz, and when to get back to the story. The result is a totally delightful romp through a strange and fantastic comic universe, that will leave you cheering and smiling at the end and looking forward to some more in the future!",1419897600,,2267,4.875647668393782

6915207,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Saw it in the theater and bought the bluray.  The first thing you have to know is that this is equal parts a marvel movie, a James Gunn movie, and a sci-fi movie.  If none of those things interest you... You might not want to check this out, (but honestly why would you even bother reading reviews if that was the case?).

The film itself is great.  It's quirky and hilarious without being cheap or compromising the dignity of any of the main characters.  The chemistry of the team is the joy of the movie, and I really look forward to future installments of this franchise.

The only complaint is where the villain is concerned.  He is a little one-note and generic, a throw away that really only serves as a backdrop for the team to play off of and hold a place for the next, more serious threat once introductions are out of the way.  You never really feel like he is a threat or care about his motivations..... You feel like if he had a mustache that he would be twirling it.

Those complaints aside, you'll be too busy enjoying the movie to analyze it that in depth until you decide to write a review anyway.

Let's put it this way, is the best selling Christmas gift of the year for a very good reason.  Enjoy.",1419811200,,1216,4.2894736842105265

Had I'd known how much bad language there is I would've made them wait. That was my fault - it's PG-13 afterall...I'd just heard it was a great story but no one mentioned the colorful language!,1419811200,,346,4.375

Not as intense as Winter Soldier but still a good time. I liked the characters and plot. The effects were probably the most impressive part of the movie. I mean, two main characters are completely CGI but never feel cartoony! For me though, the big draw was the expansion of the Marvel Universe into cosmic territory.",1419811200,,485,4.586206896551724

One note, the digital copy is only available through the new Disney Movies Anywhere.  It is not something you can get through Flixster.

I'm sure I could have viewed a pirated stream that would have had better quality than the ""HD"" stream I paid for from Amazon.  I had the same problem recently when I attempted to stream the last X-Men movie.  Picture was shockingly blurry and fuzzy.

Really Amazon, WTF?

I ended up getting the movie on-demand from Comcast and picture and sound were fine.

I thought the acting was good. I like Chris Pratt, he is entertaining.

I can see why this was popular.  While the movie isn't groundbreaking material it was typical superhero movie stuff,  but I enjoyed it for it's action, comedy, and overall good production.  I think this was like a more fun Star Wars/comic book movie.  I think the characters were enjoyable and interesting.  I think the comedy in the movie is mixed in just right with dialogue or small visual bits.  The action pushed the movie along of course, but it felt just right.  It has a good production value and I think it's worthy of adding to my collection.",1419724800,,861,4.379746835443038

6915519,3,B00R8GUXPG,"Wise cracking misfits get thrown in jail. They break out to sell some ball and get rich. They find out what it does. Decide to not sell it. Bad devil looking creature is after them to get the ball.

Perhaps I have superhero plots, world-is-going-to-end plots, creature character plots over load, but this movie was just a bore. The sarcasm of the ""heros"" was just a turn off. They were not just smart mouths; they were just lazy and loser types. Their entire anti-hero hero swagger can be heard in one line: ""What shall we do next? Something good? Something bad? Something good bad? All right. Something good and bad it is."" Just losers. Also the main character was another MN moth-eaten beard guy who pseudo sounds like a southerner. Definitely nothing wrong with southern accents but if you are MN shouldn't you talk like you are from MN? If you put Ashton Kutcher's body in the picture and moved his mouth as this guy talked you would think it was Ashton. I just think they are both child men. Good casting job. Losers playing slacker losers. But not people I care to watch. More supernatural fight scenes filled the void. More boring predictable stuff. As a matter of fact if I didn't know better I would think this was just a cheap half-hearted rip off of Star Wars. The space ships. The devil creatures. The humans and good creatures. The planets with weird names. It just all had this smart mouthed foul mouthed 12 y/o adolescent boy stereotype approach to it all.

I just passively watched this movie. It has all been made and seen before.",1419724800,,1547,4.581227436823105

It isn't quite slapstick enough for the under 16 traffic and not sophisticated enough for the over 35 set when some sense of irony has started its slow growth to cynicism.  It has some ho ho moments but I really don't think that they were actually planned.  The characters are stock, the plot is stock, the situations are stock.  This whole movie could have been made out of cutting floor sweepings.  One thing I realized after setting through most of it.  The movie was recommended by two sets of twenty somethings. Maybe they are developing a sense of humor because I actually took their advice and watched most of it kind of.

This one worked as a great family movie and that is all I asked for.,1419724800,,347,3.767123287671233

Average special effects. As American movies go, physical beauty is a must for the protagonists (at least the human ones) and I was surprised about the casting for the green lady, as she is no model. If you can spare 2h without much expectation this movie suits the need. If the two hours must be filled somehow then renting it online is also appropriate; if time is on your side wait until it come to regular stream on Netflix/Hulu/AmazonPrime, etc",1419724800,,692,4.823529411764706

6915765,2,B00R8GUXPG,"It's too bad so many people  are not really understanding how bad this movie really is. The comic book community, who are the vast majority supporting this film, need to have individual opinions and not love something because their ""circle"" of friends do. Anyone above a 12 year old mentality should recognize early that this film suffers from horrible dialog, misfire jokes, music that is totally out of place, bad acting and a plot that's same old same old. You can tell the producers wanted this to be exactly like the Avengers in style and tone but unfortunately they totally drop the ball. The problem is the actors. Whoever made the the decision for this casting should be fired and go back to working in the real world. Peter is a pretentious, loser sad-sack  character who is suppose to be the hero. The guy trys so hard to be Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark whipping off dialog that's suppose to be clever and funny but not. His character in the real world would be reading his very own comics in his moms basement. The Raccoon is about the most unlovable character in the movie. Telling Drax, ""Who cares if your wife and daughter are dead"" and walks away never apologizing. Speaking of Drax, he has to be the worst actor in the movie. I mean damn, it's actually cringing to listen and watch this guy try and act. Michael Rooker is so miscast. His character is basically Merle from Walking Dead. Every other word is boy or son in that white trash demeaning way. And what's up with the songs and music? I was born in 1970 and I even hated the songs. It seem so out of place when they kept sticking it in and pounding us over the head with it. Again it's very pretentious and out of place. We even get a extremely lame post credit scene. Howard The Duck?!? Really? I know it was suppose to be a joke, but Howard The Duck? This is what the producers pulled from the Marvel Files. A cameo by a character that flopped in is own movie and no one really gives a crap about. Except now, all these comic book geeks will think it was cool and probably make him a icon in the next few years. Save your time and money on this and stick to The Avenger films!!",1419724800,5,2154,4.3424317617866

Unfortunately my system is somewhat older and cannot handle DTS 7.1 so the only way we could listen to it was through the center speaker on my monitor, unless I wanted to listen to it in Dolby 5.1 in FRENCH or SPANISH!

This movie is a bit different as it's not as serious, but that's why I would give it four stars. It does lighthearted really well, is backdrop to a bunch of 80's music, and just jokes with itself along the way. Fun movie.",1419638400,,392,3.9746835443037973

So if you're watching this with a kid, be aware. If they've watched Star Wars and were fine they may be okay with this. There are strong female characters with their own goals and motivations.",1419638400,,351,4.415384615384616

6915803,2,B00R8GUXPG,"Not hearing the comedy in this that everyone else heard, I never laughed out loud. The movie basically was geared toward CG effects with the tired story of villains chasing the heroes for some entity (a ball) that destroys universes or something. How original eh..!

6915875,2,B00R8GUXPG,I am trying to get through this movie for the second time.  Turned if off half way through last night.  It is very hard to watch.  I think it was designed for grandparents to watch with their 5-8 year olds.  A lot of the costumes are bad--dyeing a person's skin is not a good costume--although some costumes are good.  It is inconsistent.  The music is very bad 1960's and 1970's (intended to appeal to the grandparent?).  Possibly the worst most annoying music that time period had to offer.  It has violence and rough language.  A lot of the content is not appropriate for children.  I wanted to like it.  I was hoping it would be cute and entertaining.  It isn't either for me.,1419638400,3,680,4.439024390243903

6915900,4,B00R8GUXPG,"I thought Marvel had bit off more than they could chew with this franchise. I never knew of the comic or if I did I probably dismissed it for the same reason I thought the film would fizzle.... 5 leads but only one human, and a red guy, a green girl, a plant and a raccoon!! Plus a cast of relative unknowns! I started the film with true doubts and was greatly surprised. It's got humor and heart. Lee Pace continues to impress. I woulda bet Ned from Pushing Daisies would not make a good heavy but I'd have been wrong. Pace has transitioned, first playing the relative emotionless elf in The Hobbit then tweaking that a bit for Guardians. Voice enhancement helps. Bradley Cooper's voicing of Rocket the raccoon is good but only part of what makes Rocket work as a character. The film isn't as good as The Avengers for multiple viewings... but it ain't bad.",1419638400,,857,4.430379746835443

6915938,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Unlike anything Marvel has ever put out, this movie broke the mold for Marvel.  It was a big gamble for the studio to invest in, but obviously, it has paid off in spades.  Thoroughly enjoyable, well written, well directed, great special effects, and the greatest bonus (at least for me), it was hysterically funny!

Knowing that Bradley Cooper was doing the voice of the Racoon (Rocket) made his lines even funnier.  Cooper proved his comedic chops in Silver Linings Playbook, which was also fantastic (IMO).  I don't know what will become of this franchise, all I know is that if there are more (which according to what I've heard there will be), I hope they use the same crew, writers, and directors.

Well done Marvel.  I take my hat off to those who do things outside their comfort zone.

6915947,1,B00R8GUXPG,"Over the years, there have been many movies that manage to cross boundaries.  Whether it's 'The Princess Bride' or 'Up', some works of fantasy are justifiably loved by young and old.  Well-drawn characters become parts of our own narratives.

'Guardians' is not that.  It's hackwork.  It substitutes noise and kinetic distraction for thoughtful writing. I'm happy that many fine actors found a payday in this movie, but I hope they have all gone out and found new agents. They deserve better.

It appears that Stan Lee and his minions have an endless fountain of these characters and I fear the onslaught is not yet over. But I prefer movies that take longer to write than they take to watch.",1419638400,15,692,4.773109243697479
6915948,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This was a movie that could have been very good, or very bad, depending on whether it was done right.  Fortunately, it was and the result was a very fun, and funny action movie.

The story revolves around the formation of Marvel's ""B Team"" of heroes, or as the Honest Trailer calls them, Space Avengers.  It is set in the Marvel Universe, so while superheroes exist none of the guardians have powers.  The closest is Groot, who is a 7 foot plus tall tree looking thing.  There is some cross-over with the other films as well.  Thanos, who was last seen in the end credits to Avengers plays another background bad guy in this one, and the collector who was in Thor 2 also makes an appearance.

The story revolves around an orb which is more powerful than most know.  It is in fact another infinity stone which can destroy almost anything (or anyone) who touches it.  Chris Pratt's Star Lord/Peter Quill character, who ends up the leader of the group, is basically a thief hired to steal the orb.  Which sets off a huge galactic chase leading to the end battle with Ronan the Accuser, played by Lee Pace.

What makes these characters interesting is that even the good guys are not all good.  And they all have very different motives.  Drax is after Ronan on a mission of revenge, Gamora is an assassin for Thanos wanting to get away from him, Rocket, Groot and Quill are basically all bounty hunters in it for the money.  But what separates them from everyone else is when they need to do the right thing to save each other, and stop the bad guy, they do.

Like I said in the beginning, this was totally a movie that could have bombed.  Considering 2 of the main characters were totally CGI, and one was an ex-wrestler who was never known to have what passes for good acting skills even in the world of pro wrestling, it could have gone bad quickly.  Luckily they wrote Drax's lines totally deadpan and made his character so monotone and serious that Bautista really did not have to do much other than be big and scary.  And the animators did so well with the CGI characters, that unlike how they would have looked back at the beginning of the CGI craze, they did not look fake or out of place at all.  Bradley Cooper brought great life to a wisecracking smart-a** racoon and the animators did such a great job giving Groot a personality, it ended up being Vin Diesel's best acting performance yet despite him only repeating the same line over and over.

For those who get the discs, the movie sounds and looks great on blu ray.  I did not watch the 3D version, but the regular version was flawless.  As far as extras go, they pretty well mirror what was on Thor 2 and Captain America 2.  A couple behind the scenes and making of features, deleted and extended scenes, a gag reel, and short look at the making of Avengers 2.

The movie does have a Star Wars meets Marvel Universe feel to it.  Or even more appropriately Spaceballs meets Marvel Universe feel.  It is as much a comedy as it is an action/adventure movie, and both aspects work very well.  If you are a fan of the other Marvel movies and are in any way on the fence about this one, I definitely think it is worth checking out.",1419638400,,3187,4.3941979522184305
6915949,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Great Marvel movie!  I took my granddaughter to see this for her birthday, and we both thought it was awesome!

6915950,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun romp through the universe. I saw this movie in the theater and new that at the end I would need to see it again to catch some of the more subtile parts. This movie is a great reminder that a picture can be made that has all the science fiction and humor of the first two Star Wars movies. I believe it is OK to play make believe with a science fiction movie and yet still not take it too serious. Great family movie, although younger children won't get the 80's humor. If you are 30 years older or more you should have a blast with the references. So go dig up your Walkman and plug in your head phones.

6916138,1,B00R8GUXPG,"I wanted to like this movie. My comic book loving friends raved about it and how funny the raccoon was, but this movie was so bad I couldn't get through most of it. There is no character development at all. At the end of the story (there's a story?) you know no more about the characters than you did at the beginning. The most interesting characters are the bad guys and they are barely in the film. If you are watching for Karen Gillan from Doctor Who, she is in it for maybe five minutes of collective screen time. The raccoon's cheesy jokes are not even jokes. It just isn't funny. Not even in a cheesy-bad way. Stealing some guy's prosthetic leg... yeah, hilarious. One character is extremely literal and truthful. So, he refers to the only female character as a whore. Completely unnecessary as that has nothing to do with her character. The big dumb tree is called a big dumb tree, the outlaw criminal is called an outlaw criminal, and the only female is called a whore. The pacing is atrocious. Expect a two hour long pod race, basically. The guy falls in love with the girl, of course. Even though they have ABSOLUTELY no reason to fall in love. It is like they tossed that in as an afterthought and it gets only seconds of attention in the film. This is just bad. Horribly bad. I could write a thesis on why this is bad. It is just a CGI fest with no meat and veg. Strap a strobe light to your head and stand in a canoe for two hours and you've got the same experience.",1419552000,26,1479,4.285714285714286

6916150,4,B00R8GUXPG,"The Guardians of the Galaxy first appeared in 1969 and in various Marvel comics of the mid-70s, like The Defenders, before appearing as the main attraction in Marvel Premiere in 1976-77. The Guardians are like the Avengers (or Justice League) of space, a superhero team with a revolving door line-up.

This popular 2014 film was based on the 2008 version of the team, which includes Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper) and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). The movie details how these characters meet and become the Guardians of the Galaxy as they square off against Ronan (Lee Pace), Nebula (Karen Gillan) and the intimidating Thanos (Josh Brolin). Michael Rooker is also on hand as Yondu, the space redneck who kidnapped Peter Quill (Star-Lord) from earth when he was a boy.

I'm only familiar with the 70's team, which included Star-Lord, Gamora and Drax, as well as the villains Thanatos and Ronan. It was fun seeing these characters come to life on the big screen. The movie combines elements of The Avengers, Star Trek and Star Wars and is a thrilling blockbuster that's fun, but probably too goofy at times for people who prefer the dead seriousness of Nolan's Batman trilogy. As far as galaxy-traveling superheroes go, I prefer the more-serious-albeit-still-amusing tone of ""Thor"" and ""Thor 2.""

Despite that cavil, I liked the way these independent, misfit anti-heroes slowly learn to gel as a team and even care for each other as the story progresses. Their initial selfish goals morph into a noble universal cause. Gamora is my favorite character, followed by Drax, Rocket and Groot. The sinister Thanos -- Jim Starlin's knock-off of Jack Kirby's Darkseid -- is excellently depicted in his brief appearance.

The film runs 121 minutes.

Suddenly we get the story of a band of alien misfits that become a rag tag team of heroes in one of the most outlandish chapters.

Guardians of the Galaxy, a comic book that many Marvel faithful have heard of, but never say much about. Re-releasing the comic in 2008 we get a whole new team with some real characters. That is what this film has, lots of character. Tons of action a great cast starring Chris Pratt, Lee Pace, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, just to name a few. Toss in a great classic rock soundtrack and some of the coolest special effects and you have a real underdog fan favorite. This ended up being one of the highest grossing films of 2014 and it is one of the true fan favorites. I am very curious to see what is in store for this team and if they will ever encounter Tony Stark and his crew in the future. With so many more chapters about to unfold in the next 5 years I am truly hooked on the Guardians.

6916202,5,B00R8GUXPG,"THIS EDITION NOTE: This copy comes with a digital copy, which is accessible and DOWNLOADABLE through iTunes.  While most movies opt out for UltraViolet copies (that are online DRM only), this edition features a full HD iTunes copy.  For this very reason, it gets my highest recommendation.

Without getting too poetic, Guardians of the Galaxy is fantastic. Pure and simple.  Guardians is just flat-out exactly what I wanted from another ""group against badguys"" action spectacle: a witty and snappy sense of humor, phenomenal writing, *gorgeous* special effects, well rounded and lovable characters and an overall story that weaves its way effortlessly into the Marvel movie mythos.  It's one of those rare, jam-packed rides that makes me want to just go get right back in line and enjoy it all over again.

It stands right next to The Avengers as an incredibly entertaining piece of filmmaking while also offering plenty of its own style and humor to make it unique, while the Sci-Fi backdrop makes Guardians all the more enthralling and fresh.  In a mere two hours the characters grow and surprise, which is incredible for 5 major characters never before introduced to the Marvel Movieverse.

The whole cast is phenomenal, but it's evident that Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) steals the show (I think the whole audience agreed on that one).  Combine winning and hysterical performances with smart, snappy writing and you get an excellent, side splitting action comedy.  Who knew?  Chris Pratt is also *perfect* as StarLord, Saldana plays Gamora very well, Vin Diesel's winning performance of Groot is awesome, and Bautista's character is just plain funny.

Combine all the above with some great emotional notes, a few excellent and relevant themes, a fun and entertaining score (combining a memorable orchestral score with classic 70's tunes) all while exploring an enticing and incredible world makes Guardians of the Galaxy just so much fun.  It may have some issues, but I had too much fun to care.  Top of the line entertainment all around, and one of the best movies of the year.",1419465600,,2088,5.049562682215743

There is Groot, Rocket Racoon and many more. This is in my humble opinion a western in space. It reminds me a lot of another great Joss Whedon project that went before it's time ""Firefly"" but with more of a storyline. These characters are brought together as nothings and make themselves into something. That's all I will give away. If you have not seen it, I strongly suggest you do.

6916281,1,B00R8GUXPG,One of the worst movies I have ever watched.  Acting sucked and screen way to dark during some scenes couldn't see what was going on.  I can't understand what anyone liked about this let alone compare it to Star Wars!  I am afraid this confirms that we are degrading as a society.,1419379200,5,280,4.346153846153846
6916282,5,B00R8GUXPG,Didn't know much about the guardians of the galaxy going in and I'm a avant comic collector. I knew it was probably a enjoyable movie before seeing but just didn't know about a talking raccoon seem sort of dumb to me at first (but a guy in a bat costume kicking ass is ok). But I saw the movie in the theater and I got to say it's a really well made movie and the character development is amazing. It's got a lot of action and cool visuals but it's not all just throw in there for entertainment value it helps the progression of the story and plot and with a lot of humor not sort of silly humor but stuff that actually is really funny but does not taint the edge of the characters. Don't know how close it keeps to the comic books but still a great movie none the less. It's got sort of a cooler Star Wars vibe with star lord sort of reminding me of Han Solo but a little cooler.,1419379200,,880,4.005681818181818

6916302,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is one of those rare occasions where the final product surpassed the brilliant trailer. Sadly, more often than not, the trailers promise so much more than the film actually delivers. In THIS case, the film was more fun than I anticipated. Yes...the operative word being ""FUN"". It's filled with all the archetypes, plot devices, laughs, and pathos that cinema should contain. It's also one of the most colorful films I've seen in a long time.

As a member of the original Star Wars generation, I would even go as far to say this ranks up there among the best summer popcorn flicks in history. That is saying A LOT as I am not a fan of this age of CGI crap fests the studios crank out every summer. It's a blast to look at, but it also has a hell of a bunch of heart.

Well done, Mr. Gunn.",1419379200,,811,4.294117647058823
6916303,3,B00R8GUXPG,"This is not a review of the movie, just a quick note of why I give it only 3 stars.  The movie is good, but the portrayal of Thanos as
the ultimate evil character he is was lost to me.  Thanos  evoked no fear or apprehension.  The Ronin part was done well.
The series would have been better to start with Thanos and Ronin only so the audience would know what these characters
are capable of doing and then have the Guardians come in later in the series.  The background of these bad guys needs to be
better established to make the series more sensational.",1419379200,,555,4.247619047619048

Predictable, to the point where characters did things just to satisfy what the screenwriter thought the audience might expect. Too long, desperately in the need of editing. So much CGI that the movie felt like you were looking at the Guardians of the Galaxy action figure set, not real people in real locations. Unfunny attempts at humor. One-dimensional characters and performances. More like a series of video game cut scenes than a real movie.",1419379200,15,561,5.2444444444444445

Really, you haven't seen its like since Mystery Men when it comes to comic book comedy/adventure movies...and you haven't seen its like since Farscape on the Sci-Fi front. All around the best out of left field adaptation of a comic book. Clever nods to the grandfather of the title (the late, great Jack Kirby) abound and it incorporates one of the more unconventional Marvel events in a way that leaves you eagerly anticipating the sequel.

...So, James Gunn. Can you show D.C. a little love and give us a Shadowpact movie? (Why is this not a thing that is happening already? Can we just give James Gunn all comedic ensemble properties henceforth and have him sculpt them into sheer awesomeness?)",1419292800,,748,4.84375

There appears to be an error in the encoding of the film, I understand that the film was shot in different aspect ratios but that should not translate to my screen constantly fluctuating between full and wide screen view. This issue should have been resolved in post production. It is very distracting. I have not had this problem with any other 3D content. The standard versions of the film both DVD and Blu-ray appear fine, so this clearly could have been resolved prior to release. Doesn't seem fair that when you pay more for the 3D box set of the film that you get a half mastered version in 3D.",1419292800,23,667,4.475409836065574

6916532,5,B00R8GUXPG,"The past few years have been very good to movies based on comic books. While those based on DC comics have been slow out of the gate movies based on Marvel comics licenses have skyrocketed. Perhaps the most surprising of these was a movie based on a lesser known and not hugely popular comic that took the box office by storm. Not only was it a surprise hit it just might be the best of the Marvel movies released to date. That movie arrives on DVD this week and is called GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.

The movie opens with a young boy confronted with the death of his mother to cancer. Running from the hospital he finds himself beamed aboard a UFO. Fast forward some years later and we see that boy now grown landing on a desolate planet devoid of human life forms. He steals an orb from a futuristic safe and is then set upon by minions of Ronan the Accuser out to take the orb for their leader. When he tells them his name is Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) otherwise known as Star Lord they are less than impressed, not even recognizing it. That adds to their surprise when he takes back the orb and flees with them hot on his trail.

Quill is out to make some money by taking the orb he was sent to steal to a dealer and bypassing his leader, the head of the Ravagers known as Yondu (Michael Rooker). At the same time Ronan (Lee Pace) has set his own special warrior to retrieve the orb, Gamora (Zoe Saldana). The dealer cancels the deal when he learns of Ronans involvement and Gamora tries to take the orb. At that same moment an unlikely pair of fortune seekers reads that Yondu has put a price on Quills head. The pair is Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) who actually is a raccoon, and his partner Groot (Vin Diesel), a walking talking plant. As the four struggle for control of one another they are eventually captured by the space police known as the Nova Corp.

Sent to the worst prison in the universe the four make a deal to get the orb and take it to a buyer Gamora is aware of. It turns out she hates Ronan and is double crossing him. When they arrive at the prison she is set upon by a few inmates, specifically Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista). When Drax learns that Gamora was not responsible for the murder of his family, he joins with the foursome to plan their escape so he can seek revenge.

Escape they do and from there the adventure moves forward with alarming speed. Moving from one part of the universe to another, pursued by Ronan who is working for a cosmic bad guy named Thanos (Josh Brolin) and wanted by the Nova Corp, the five misfits join forces to do what it right. Eventually that comes down to facing off against Ronan after he has taken the orb and utilized it to his advantage. By the third act the now called Guardians of the Galaxy have united with the Nova Corp and try to save a world from being obliterated.

I have to say that words cannot begin to describe how much I enjoyed this movie, so much so that watching it on DVD was my third viewing. I can tell you that it holds up to multiple viewings and is one that Ill probably watch every few months, enjoying it each and every time. This movie offers the near perfect combination of action, humor, worlds of wonder and space opera unlike any seen before. Watching this movie brought back memories of the first time I saw STAR WARS. It is that good.

The driving force that brought this about was director James Gunn, a man who labored under some truly bad movies for Troma but who has grown into an accomplished director who knows how to do it right. Once you include some amazing performances by all around and in particular Pratt who brings Quill to life, you have a great flick. That is just added to by the eye popping special effects on scene here from the basic aliens done with make up to the state of the art CGI effects that bring Rocket and Groot to life.

While these things combine to make it look great, the story itself takes it over the top. This is a tale of misfits, a group of people who don't quite fit in anywhere, who band together to form something good. In the process they begin to become friends and to care for one another. At times they frustrate one another and at others they're willing to sacrifice themselves to save their group as well as the Universe. In so doing these criminals become the greatest of heroes.

This year Ive seen more movies than usual not just on DVD but in theaters. I can say now without a doubt that this was by far my favorite film of the year. My guess is that due to its popularity and the fact it is comic book based it won't be nominated for any major awards with the exception of effects. Thats too bad because for me this was the best movie of the year. Add it to your collection today.",1419292800,2,4737,4.284916201117318

I have no idea what the accomplished movie critic would say about this film, but I have watched it several times and have no real criticisms.  It appeals to the imagination, has tons of action, and the special effects are 'first rate'.  The characters Rocket and Groot are a little hard to take, but, all in all, come across as 'second-level' super heroes.

I wasn't familiar with the comic book series, and I don't think one needs to be in order to enjoy it.  The animation, especially in the action scenes, was not seizure-inducing like some other sci-fi movies as of late, and the characters were cast well and likeable.

6916883,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Didn't expect much from this movie at all since, like most people, I wasn't familiar with the comic series and it had a talking squirrel...but it turned out to be one of my favorite Marvel movies. Perfect balance of humor, action, and amazing visuals. To me, this feels like this generation's Star Wars (we'll see if the actual new Star Wars ep. 7 lives up to that). The blu-ray has some pretty decent extras like the ""making of"" featurettes and audio commentary.",1419292800,,463,4.658536585365853

6916904,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie was very good and my favorite characters were Rocket and Groot.  I think they could remove the language as it's not necessary.  The movie can easily stand on it's own without that and it would open it up to younger children (yes, there are still parents that don't want their kids to hear the language).  Overall, very good movie there are parts that show references to movies and events past that made it that much more enjoyable.",1419292800,,442,4.569620253164557

6916922,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Okay, I have to admit, when I first rented this I was expecting something really stupid, but, being out voted by my better half and 9 year old, I had to concede.
But I have to admit, in about 20 minutes really started liking this movie.
It has all the flavors of entertainment:
Good Effects
Good, dark Comedy
Lightheartedness with some of the banter
Zoe Saldana in a great outfit painted green
Oh, and more green Zoe Saldana
Did I mention it has Zoe Saldana in it?

No, but seriously, it's like Star Wars, the 5th Element and Star Trek rolled into one.
Very entertaining and great for the kids, they watched it two more times.",1419206400,,626,4.396551724137931

6916925,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Perhaps this movie caters to a certain age group or sense of humor, but it was right up my ally.

I knew I was going to love this movie from the opening scene where Star Lord  is singing in to the space rat to the awesome song of ""Come and Get your love"" The dialogue is quick and witty,the world  and technology  itself is varied and interesting.

The villains were  as fresh as they could be. The characters were all well played and believable. The movie is tinged with 80's nostalgia which I love. I think a lot of the people who gave it a one star review may be just too young to catch all the references,hence not finding it funny.

The soundtrack itself is a character in the movie. Come on Ziggy Star Dust  ! Oh the awesomeness. I cannot wait for the second movie.

Yes there are a few potty words but not the F word and yes there is some space shooting violence.

I was pleased to get to see my  dance off in the bonus scenes and it so made my month. Awesome movie for people who love sci fi and the awesome 80's.",1419206400,30,1021,4.080402010050252

Besides the fact I'm completely unfamiliar with the comics,  It looked like one of those that gave away all the best bits in the previews and would just be a clustercuss of a movie that tried too hard to make me care.  If it weren't for a trusted friends ""dude...trust me.""  I never would have seen this in the theater.

This film is fantastic..  The dialouge.  The delivery.  The cast.  The action.  I wish I could compare it to another for a frame of reference, but it's really just so delightfully odd and doesn't neatly fit into any one genre.  It's comedy and action not truly seen since maybe 80s era Indiana Jones.

6917281,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Marvel has done it yet again. This time instead of using the famous spotlight of Iron Man and the Avengers, Marvel tackles a rather obscure group of characters called the Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie follows these five adventurers as they embark on an action packed ride to save the universe. All the while these characters discover what the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe is building towards. Yet they remain blissfully unaware of many of the key players in this coming event and there is also the possibility that they in fact may play a larger role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. No other director besides James Gunn could have pulled this movie off. The comedy was excellent as these characters are not to be taken completely serious, and the story and introduction of these characters in all is very well executed. While this movie is a part of the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe it is very well contained and doesn't require a lot of prior knowledge of the characters or the story. Though you do see two or three familiar characters from the Avengers for a very short moment. Overall, another hit from Marvel. I enjoy all of their movies so far and I look forward to whatever they present to us in the future.",1419033600,,1236,4.700460829493087

I also thought it very unusual how quickly and easily characters who seemed to be adversaries suddenly became friends and developed strong bonds. The movie really feels like they tried to compress too much story into a 90 minute film. The storyline should have centered around Groot and Rocket",1419033600,,468,5.012820512820513

So I'm upgrading my review from ""it stunk"" to ""good, pretty funny with occasional moments lame moments""

***UPDATED REVIEW ABOVE***

I love action films with space aliens and I think Marvel Studios has created a lot of hits but this was one of the worst things I've seen in a long time.  It was stupid from beginning to end with idiotic dialogue. I wish I had ten thumbs so I could point them all down.",1419033600,,669,4.312

I seem to only like the ones with either 1). real science (or mostly science), or 2). irreverent humor. So Batman (Nolan's first two) for #1, and Hell Boy for #2 are the only ones other than this that I can watch more than once. All the others that are coming out over the next several years I couldn't care less about. A sequel to this will be a must see, though.",1419033600,,440,4.127906976744186

That's the best way I can think to describe the final product as it was the most fun I've had all year in theaters, and it is undoubtedly my favorite film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far, which is filled with some fantastic quality films. The only negatives I have regarding this product is that the extra features (especially the Sneak Peak at Age of Ultron) felt a little lacking, but what's there is fun and the film itself is more than enough to give this blu-ray package a 5-star rating.",1419033600,,546,4.362745098039215

Even if your not a fan of sci-fi fan I think you'll enjoy this movie. The easter eggs scattered throughout the movie are great references to older sci-fi characters/movies. I would definitely head the PG-13 rating, the humor is at such a level the younger audience might not follow but the action can be fairly intense from a visual standpoint. My daughters love superhero movies but it will be many years before I let them watch. Overall I would highly recommend this movie.",1419033600,,627,4.709090909090909

6917359,4,B00R8GUXPG,"What fun! Just as I was growing bored of the Marvel films and their repetitive look and feel, this comes along and breathes new life into the comic-book movie genre for me. Props to Winter Soldier as well, that was a fantastic movie.

This one stands on its own as an irreverent and quirky thrill-ride. Whereas most of the other franchises have all merged into one big jumbled mess, Guardians stands apart. It is sharply produced, but possesses an element of soul that most big blockbuster franchises have entirely lost these days. The soundtrack certainly helps. ""Anti-hero in space struts around firing laser beams while grooving to 70's hits?"" I'm in! There's plenty of camp around the edges to keep the action light-hearted; I bet this movie was a blast to make, the entire cast seems to greatly enjoy themselves.

Pratt rolled the dice on hooking up with an unknown franchise, but the roll came up good and has paid off in spades; with this movie he's established himself as a new star and he just oozes charisma on the screen. His character is less the average dumb action star and more of the swashbuckling Indiana Jones-type just, you know, in space. He's in way over his head, but he's having a good time, and when the action subsides and he's still left standing, there's a smirk and a grin on his face as if to say ""holy crap, I can't believe that actually worked!""

On the downside, some of the jokes probably won't fly the second time, and simply for the sake of expediency it wraps up the film with just a stereotypical mash of in-your-face action in the last third.",1419033600,,1580,4.595744680851064

The previews for this movie made it seem fairly funny and my daughter really wanted to see it, so I relented and we rented it. I can say that she at least truly enjoyed it (she's 18). To me the plot was rather loose, with so much introduced as far as the ""world building"" that without playing closer attention it was difficult to keep everything/one straight. However, a caveat there - I was undergoing a medical test that week that required me to be sleep deprived, so it's possible I simply had a harder time keeping the names/worlds/planets straight because of this. Another thing that bothered me was that while the trailer seemed funny, in large part the most funny scenes were actually featured ON the trailer so no real new laughs. (Except for the attempted dance off - probably the best scene).

There were also some unanswered questions that I guess could be addressed in a sequel, but I have heard nothing of one being made (and wouldn't watch regardless). Still, it was a 3-day rental and my daughter watched twice so I suppose the $ was worth it, and always good to do anything with my girl.  ",1418947200,,1116,4.537313432835821

6917414,1,B00R8GUXPG,"I am not negatively critiquing the movie. The movie was amazing. I am thoroughly disgusted by the quality of this disk.

First, the aspect ratio seems to be off. The entire film is more dark than I remember it being, and no, it's not my television or player. I just watched another movie and it was fine.

Second, there were two separate moments when the screen went completely black for a noticeable amount of time as scenes transitioned. This did not happen in the theater. Why is it happening in my copy?

Third, and most importantly, I like to pause my blu-rays and see things I missed in the theater. A key scene I intended to view slowly was after the arrest when some character information is displayed too quickly for me to read.

When I paused a huge image obscured all the text. This image tells me where I am in the film. I can't make it go away, I can't even move it. I am disgusted. Why is it even there? Why is it so big?

G-rated words cannot express my feelings but I'll try: what were those blasted incompetent individuals of low intelligence with inadequate planning skills thinking!

6917578,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Guardians of the Galaxy is exciting, and well written with imaginative dialogue and editing.  I believe the last time I've enjoyed watching a movie this much was when the first Star Wars movie came out.  The movie is based on the old, Marvel Comics...but the director, Bryan Singer brings a refreshing and modern touch to the story. Reading reviews from the one and two star commentators, I would agree this movie could have increased it's likability if it had a more fully developed plot...but it is quirky, quick and fun.  My only explanation why someone would label this movie ""dull, is that they do not like ""fun,"" and ""quirky.""  My favorite character was Groot played by Vin Diesel.  He probably had the easiest to remember dialogue in science fiction film history only having to say, ""I am Groot,"" throughout most of the film.",1418860800,,832,4.79020979020979
6917589,5,B00R8GUXPG,"I was pleasantly surprised. Thought it would just be another superhero film with tons of non-stop action, but the film had a wide range of characters that mixed well together and the story did not disappoint. Loved the music, and overall feel of the movie and would definitely recommend as one of the best Superhero movies I have seen.",1418860800,,335,4.694915254237288
6917590,2,B00R8GUXPG,It's stupid,1418860800,,11,5.0
6917591,3,B00R8GUXPG,"This is a tough review to write...

The film was good. But it wasn't great. The cast from Chris Pratt down performed quite admirably. Even Vin Diesel who basically had one line throughout the film put forward some effort. What wasn't there for consideration was a substantive story.  The musical interludes... As a child of the 80's, they were much appreciated.  As for Chris, Zoe and company galavanting across the universe. It was tough to swallow.  Odd-balls of different strokes all come together inside a magical minute to form a perfect bond and fight off the bad guy?  They had to kill my favorite shield agent to pull The Avengers together. This was all just too convenient.  In case I didn't say it earlier... Chris Pratt was one of the few things to salvage this movie and why I gave it a third star.

Now. If you want to chide me for calling this movie filler, go right ahead. But that is all it was.  The first Ironman managed to combine substance with origin story -- and did it well. But then again, that was Paramount, and this is Disney now operating behind the scenes.

For me, there were two things to take away from this film... The Starlord back story was sufficiently teased but never really explained which led me to go and do a little research on wikipedia to find out what I was missing from the comic book translation. The second bit - where is this story going?  I kept wracking my brain wondering to myself... You don't need any Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel... That's what Thor and his people are for, isn't it?  Unless of course this is not part of the greater Marvel Universe but is somehow part of the three-phase Disney/Marvel movie plan.  I digress.

A question I am left with... If I am not a comic book fanatic, how are Thanos and Ultron different bad guys?  They both seem to feature prominently in upcoming Marvel sequels.

Is it worth seeing?  Yes.
Is it better than other Marvel films?  Not even close.
Would you rent it again or buy it?  Sadly, no.",1418860800,,1990,4.495821727019498

6917595,3,B00R8GUXPG,"Good special effects, but an odd movie with a plot that appears to have been borrowed from several other much better movies. The soundtrack leaves a lot to be desired; a variety of tracks that seem to have been picked (blindfolded) from a second-rate 'Best of the 60s' album. It can get tedious at times. The first time I watched it, I thought it was awful; the second time (I wanted to give it a chance), I found it a little more entertaining.

This movie was a lot of fun. If you are a fan of comics movies OR sci-fi I believe you will enjoy it as well. Unlike some 'super-hero' movies they don't spend a lot of time on back-story; they give you just enough to become involved with the characters and then off you go!! Make sure to watch after the credits, like many movies these days.
I hope they have many sequels coming.",1418860800,,392,4.24

Make no mistake, it's not a parody like a Naked Gun movie, it just has a slight wink and tinkle of the eye...it's pure fun. I'm suprised every kid didn't go as Rocket Racoon for Halloween this year.

It has all that a good needs, a solid plot, great action, and very likable character with the added bonus of tons of Easter eggs hidden throughout the movie that will keep comic fans and people that grew up in the 80's hunting for a long time.

6918300,5,B00R8GUXPG,"A lovable rogue who wants to be known as Star Lord, a green-skinned assassin; a talking - and somewhat psychopathic - raccoon; a plant-man with a 3-word vocabulary and a muscle-bound guy with severe anger issues are the ""Guardians of the Galaxy' and they're trying to save a planet in this high-flying SciFi flick from Marvel Comics.
This film got a lot of pre-release buzz and I was a little worried that it wouldn't live up to the hype but it did - at least for me. The actors - led by Chris Pratt and the always delectable Zoe Saldana - give performances that are a shade over the top but - hey - this is a SciFi adventure about an evil fanatic who wants to obliterate a planet so I'm thinking that's forgivable.
The visuals are excellent, something I've come to expect when Marvel is involved in a production, and the soundtrack features some really great music from the days when songs were sung, not screamed. I particularly enjoyed the obsession Pratt's character has with his music and his unrelenting attempts to get Saldana's character to dance with him.
This film has its share of funny moments but it's not a comedy, per se. I like the fact that it also contained some pathos and some well-done scenes that showed how much the misfits who are thrown together in this world-saving quest learn to appreciate, and care for, one another.
All in all, an excellent flick.",1418774400,2,1377,4.578947368421052

Whereas I liked some of the jokes that were not too overly forced and lame and some visuals the film just doesn't deliver the goods. Being a Marvel film it makes sense though. There are some funny and fun scenes that do not make one cringe but is a very overrated film with not much to it unfortunately. Starts off good then goes down quickly. If you are a kid or pre-teen this is your kind of film, if an adult well if you like mindless corn you are all set. I expected more with all the reviews over the past year but films are not too good these days so it makes sense as to why this was overrated so much. Definitely a Gunn film but not as good as other efforts. That being said, loved Cooper's over the top voice unlike the lame villain Ronan who is a dead ringer for Superbad's McLovin.

6918384,4,B00R8GUXPG,"New York Times has already released its list (or one critics list) of the best 10 films of 2014 and shockingly, this is not one of them.  Yet the critic does note, peering down spectacles at the audience, that it has already scored some 300 million dollars, which I think is more than any of the films on his list
.
My wife watched 5-10 minutes of it and dismissed it as a guy movie.  OK sure, I can see why younger boys and men could be its main target audience, but my question was: why cant more women appreciate the sheer physical beauty of a film, even if they have to ignore the plot, characters, dialog and action?

This is yet another movie inspired by the characters and stories of a Marvel Comix series.  I was interested to read how, when the first one of those came out Marvel Comix was about ready to collapse financially.  Fortunately for it, it received cash up-front for the movie rights to that film, and ever since, we have been subjected to pretty much an annual Marvel-based film or even several: Iron Man, Spiderman, Captain America, Thor, Incredible Hulk, Avengers, as well as now Guardians of the Galaxy.

I can see the potential value for kids (those who are old enough, as it does depict plenty of combat, and at least implied deaths.  The film is rated PG-13).  Back to the potential value: as the main character, who dubs himself Star Lord observes about halfway through the movie, We have a lot in common.  Weve all lost a lot.  At the beginning, only two of the five main characters are working together.  They are thrown together with the others by the plot, initially competing against each other, and from wildly different backgrounds.  By the end of the film, of course they have become firm friends while saving the galaxy.  There has to be a subliminal message there, about accepting others despite apparent differences and about finding unexpected friends.

That being said, the main draw of the film, as far as I was concerned, really was the special effects, which were spectacular.  There are no great quotes, the plot is not any more complex than a 13 year old can handle, the acting was decent, and there were a heck of a lot of big names and recognizable faces in this cast.  Some romantic interest is provided in the relationship between Chris Pratt (Star Lord) and Zoe Saldana as the green-skinned but still fine-looking Gamora.  Of course the most unusual characters are a mutant raccoon-looking creature voiced by Bradley Cooper, and the treelike Groot, voiced by Vin Diesel.

Plans are well underway apparently for a sequel to be released in 2017.  If its as pretty and as friendly as this one, it should do well.",1418688000,,2660,4.6093418259023355

That's the kind of silliness that stands out in my memory from my childhood, and that's exactly what you're getting here AND MORE!

James Gunn, director and co-writer, provides a commentary track for the movie. He learned film-making at Troma Studios, which is just the coolest pedigree I can think of for the Marvel Universe. And he clearly did his homework and cares a great deal about his characters (and his cast). There are also featurettes about making the movie and the Marvel MU.

The movie is not flawless, but it has one of the best soundtracks like ever, and the casting achieved a great ensemble that feels emotionally connected at the apex of the movie.

I have been following the Marvel universe from Iron Man one (including Captain America, Thor, The Avengers, Agents of SHIELD, etc.) and I can't wait until this group of characters begins merging with the others!!! I am not a comic reader, though my husband is and he keeps me apprised of the differences and similarities that Marvel Studios is keeping with the comics and I am just fascinated with the studio's ability to make such enthralling stories, especially with how they all integrate with one another. This particular film did a wonderful job introducing a whole new set of characters, ensuring that you knew enough of their back-story to be engaged with the characters, but not so much that it drown out the plot of the film. I can't say enough good things about this film!",1418688000,,858,4.76510067114094

6918868,2,B00R8GUXPG,"I collect movies and bought this movie based on the 5 star reviews.  I just don't get it. All I can figure is that the movie industry is now paying reviewers instead of script writers.
The raccoon was cute, but the lack luster script was largely carried by the 70's soundtrack. Beyond that it was two hours of battle scenes and special effects.. It also took the idea that 'evil"" is a good reason to do something WAY too far. How about some real motivation?? Only one character had it because he lost his wife and child and he pretty much forgot about it when someone told him to ""get over it"".  He was also belittled for having a vocabulary and I'm not talking about words you'd have to look up, I'm talking about words most people used to know before the dumbing down of America. Useful only as a testament to how low our taste and acceptance of banality has fallen. To say I sorely regret this purchase is an understatement.",1418688000,6,927,4.383720930232558

Immediately after taking it he is captured and is thrown together with an evil mercenary Gamora (Saldana), a brute bent on revenge, a fast talking raccoon, and a tree. When the true nature of the artifact is found out the group must find a way to work together to save a planet. First off I have to start by saying once again that I am not a big fan of comic book movies. I didn't see this in the theatre but the only thing I have heard since then is how great this was. Every single person that saw this told me how good it was. I head the best superhero movie ever over and over so the expectations were a little higher than normal for this. I don't know if it was the expectations or that I am tired of comic book movies but I was disappointed in this and wasn't all that impressed. I thought the best part was the soundtrack and the raccoon. This is a movie that is almost critic proof since it seems that any super hero movie makes a billion dollars so really nothing I say will change anyones mind but I have to say I wasn't amazed by this like everyone else was. Overall, Im sure I am one of the only ones to say this but I didn't really like this. I give it a B-.",1418601600,3,1391,4.043478260869565

Chris Pratt and his band of misfits are a KICK! The plot weaves late 70s tunes with the story line to great effect. I watched this three time in two days",1418601600,,310,4.016129032258065

6919012,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Running Time Approx. 2hrs Hi Def. 7.1 DTS Sound, and Hi Def. widescreen picture. Movies like this don't come along too often. Its not a spoof movie, but for me some aspects of its humor are reminiscent of Space-Balls and the Green Lantern. This film is well written and produced to (A-list) level production, which means top-end CG effects. This movie is funny, serious, and emotional all in one, and the make-up for all of the various sci-fi humanoid beings and their various wardrobes are absolutely amazing! Hardcore fighting and (hand to hand) combat sequences. All set designs have stunning detail and realism. Some of the sci-fi futuristic ideas for weapons and space craft designs are cutting edge. Even though this movie has its flaws, example NO living being or creature can space-walk without a space suit  and or be exposed to outer space in the flesh without being crushed to death by the sheer pressure and force of outer space. Thats a quality assurance no-no for a space movie, unless you are the Alien from the move Alien! Otherwise, the movie is amazing and fun entertainment for everyone. The movie is absolutely hilarious, I have never laughed so hard like I did watching this movie, in a long time. Buy on Blu-ray. This one is a classic keeper.

6919016,5,B00R8GUXPG,"One of the best Marvel movies to come out this year and that is saying something if you count the Captain America and Iron Man franchises. Guardians not only follows the rich marvel comic history of this team and it's villain's but it blends in so much humor and action and heart it's just hard not to look and want to look again. Chris Pratt really does and outstanding job as StarLord, while Rocket Racoon and Groot provide much of the comic relief. And who would have thought of all people that Josh Brolin even being the great actor that he is.....who would have thought he would be chewing up the scenery in a marvel movie playing one of the most iconic bad guys of all time Thanos!

I love the story and all the characters and while in a way it seemed to run long...I did not let it bother me instead just go along for the ride and enjoy this latest marvel masterpiece.",1418515200,,875,4.303030303030303

6919162,5,B00R8GUXPG,"When I went to see this movie in 3-D with my brother and his eleven year old son last Summer it reminded me of one my most cherished moments of my childhood.  I was fourteen in the Summer of 1977 and the third oldest of nine kids.  My father worked seven days a week sometimes at two jobs just to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.  Despite that he tried to make time for his offspring.  One Saturday he surprised me and took me to see ""Star Wars"".  Aside from it being a film like any that I had seen up to that time it gave me some valuable bonding time with my Dad.  You may ask what this all has to do with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"".  I figure when all is said and done there will be over 10,000 reviews and in many cases blogs about the movie on the Amazon site and there will certainly be a degree of repetition.  Watching ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" I felt like a kid again and I hold it in the hallowed place that ""Star Wars"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" occupies in my heart",1418515200,,997,3.95

6919184,2,B00R8GUXPG,"A very poor attempt!  I was sucked in by all the very positive reviews, and all the hype selling this movie in ads and trailers.  I am a huge fan of many of the Marvel comic-to-movie efforts, however this one falls considerably short in many ways.  I would have posted a single star rating if not for some amazing artwork and special effects.  The plot is extremely confusing and the movie bogs down with a tediousness that made me stop watching half way through.  I guess there are a lot of hard core Marvel fans out there given all the five star ratings, and for them, plot is secondary to simply seeing the comic come to life on screen.  I kept hoping the movie would draw me in, but there was never that ""oh, wow"" moment whether generated by some crazy amazing stunt, plot twist, or mystery to make me want to continue watching.",1418515200,5,832,4.37012987012987

6919187,4,B00R8GUXPG,"I was really looking forward to this Blu-ray release and it was pretty good overall. However, I was a little disappointed because it looked like it had the potential to be the Star Wars of Marvel movies. It seemed to tout some Han Solo swagger and had some cool-looking concept art that gave me some hope that this could be a new favorite. Well, it just didn't happen. It has some interesting moments, but it plays a little more like a mix of Ice Pirates and maybe The Fifth Element. Don't get me wrong, I liked those movies for what they were, but they aren't favorites by any stretch of the imagination. This left me feeling about the same as most recent Marvel films, a lot of cool stuff and you get more than your money's worth in effects, but it still comes up short since it doesn't take itself all that seriously. And by that I mean it has some humor that would probably make a veteran crime scene detective blush (Jackson Pollack reference) and I'd call it juvenile but that would be an insult to juveniles so should probably call it sociopathic humor to be more accurate, just gross for a mainstream film. Couldn't imagine a Star Wars movie making crude jokes like that. Plus, as the film goes on you never really feel like anyone is in real danger. I don't know, it seems the Marvel world of superheroes is in the wrong hands. Sure there are some great special effects and they brilliantly tie them all together, but with the gross jokes here and the booze-swilling crew in The Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer it's tough to tell which ones are the heroes and which are the villains. I think films like Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy and even Man of Steel have a better approach to what superheroes should be. A hero like Peter Quill/Star Lord who describes his quarters as looking like a Jackson Pollack painting under a blacklight doesn't seem very heroic. Like I said though, it was still a fun movie with lots of cool effects, but couldn't take it more seriously than it took itself.",1418515200,,1993,4.493112947658402

6919200,2,B00R8GUXPG,"Oh my lord, what is it about this movie you all are high-fiving? I haven't seen a movie fall this far below its hype and raves since, well, Prometheus and Avatar. The storytelling here is dreadful, just dreadful. They try to cram like three dozen major characters and all their stories and WAY too much backstory and exposition into a single movie. It's like trying to speed-read through an entire comic book series in one sitting. The result is a total narrative mess. Half the time you have to strain to figure out what's happening or why, and strain harder to care. The shame is that there are a lot of nice little moments and one-liners scattered through it, but they don't add up to anything coherent. At best this is like the rough draft of a screenplay. Yes, it looks good in that giant-screen 3-D CGI created by 10,000 programmers way that big-budget movies do now, but is that really enough for you all? Me, I'd much rather watch a smaller-budget, lovingly-crafted movie with real characters and stories like, say, Serenity or THX-1138 or such. I love sc-fi, but after all the hoopla, I was supremely underwhelmed by this.",1418428800,3,1131,4.66
6919201,4,B00R8GUXPG,"THE FILM: First off, I don't read comic books, but I am at least nominally familiar with a lot of the Marvel characters. That being said, I had no idea who the Guardians of the Galaxy were. To a degree, after seeing this, I still don't completely understand since they don't really go into a lot of character depth but I am interested in going back to this world and exploring these characters again. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY has eye-popping visuals, an incredible soundtrack and some legitimately good world-building that manage to transcend a rather run-of-the-mill story. The basic plot is that these five characters, who are all outcasts in their own way, are thrust together through circumstance and unite to overcome a villain bent on destroying a planet. Those characters are Peter Quill/Starlord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel). The best elements of the film which stuck out to me were the outstanding visual effects, world-building and character design. There are a lot of things thrown in together, and despite the enormity of it all, I never felt overwhelmed. Also, the action sequences were well-shot and there some truly amazing space battles. The performances, however, are more of a mixed bag. First, I will say that Chris Pratt was amazing as Peter Quill. He brought an everyman quality to his character and had a great sense of humor. Rocket and Groot were also great characters to watch in every scene they appeared. I'd go so far as to say they were my favorite characters. They were equal parts cute and badass, and have some of the best lines and most poignant scenes in the whole movie. On the other end, though, I thought that Dave Bautista and Karen Gillan (as Nebula) weren't at the same level as other members of the cast. And then there were other characters who barely registered because they just weren't in the movie that much. Thanos is one of these, and I also didn't like Josh Brolin's voiceover. You also have John C. Reilly and Glenn Close who show up for a few scenes. Sadly, the main villain Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) was just as weak a villain as any other villain in a Marvel film. That's not to say that Lee Pace didn't do a good job or that the character didn't look cool, but he just wasn't given enough to do. On a more positive note, the soundtrack was amazing. Kind of makes me want to buy a copy of Awesome Mix Vol. 1. And, for all of the lack of originality in the story, it was executed in an interesting way and elevated by the chemistry of the core cast members. I wouldn't say that it's the best Marvel movie to date, but it certainly is the most ""out of the box"" and daring thing that they've attempted so far.

THE EXTRAS: Unfortunately, there isn't a wealth of supplementary material, but it is worth watching. There are two featurettes, totaling about 30 minutes, that go into various aspects of production. The first is a guide by James Gunn that has several interviews with the crew and cast members talking about their experiences and characters. There's also a shorter featurette which goes into the visual effects and creation of Groot and Rocket. In addition, there's around 4 minutes worth of deleted/extended scenes with optional director commentary. However, these scenes have unfinished visual effects and/or are roughly animated. Finally, there is a gag reel and a feature-length audio commentary by James Gunn. All things considered, they could have had a lot more material but what they provided was interesting enough.

OVERALL: I was expecting quite a bit given all of the hype surrounding this film, and for the most part it delivered. It has some of the most eye-popping visuals ever seen in a Marvel film and some of the best humor. Sure, a few of the performances weren't on par with the rest of the cast, but I'm sure they'll up their game in the sequel. As for the special features, the quantity was a bit lacking but delivered in terms of quality. So, this Blu-ray package is a must-own for Marvel fans and everyone else should enjoy it as a rollicking space opera.",1418428800,17,4132,4.705801104972376

6919222,4,B00R8GUXPG,"In Guardians of the Galaxy a group of intergalactic misfits are forced to work together to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.

I really didn't know anything about this comic from Marvel but since I am a fan of most Marvel films, I decided to watch this one.  At first, I wasn't really sure what to think of this eclectic band of characters including a talking raccoon and a tree, but over the course of the movie, my favorite character of the movie was one of the strangest of characters, Groot, the tree.  Even though he had few lines, or rather few words, he had a charm about him that made him the favorite of the movie for me.

The story itself starts a bit slow, but is to be expected in order to introduce the characters and give the backstory.  But the action does get going and the movie is fun and entertaining all the way through.  The special effects are well done throughout the movie and the character interaction funny as well.

Overall, this is a fun sci-fi action adventure movie that even though I wasn't familiar, I quickly became a fan of the unique band of heroes.  I look forward to the sequel.

6919412,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Good flick overall but I think I was expecting more.  Perhaps I over hyped it in my mind waiting to see it or maybe I was expecting more/something different in it.

I did like it, I'm glad I bought it and watched it twice already and probably will a few more times before I get it out of my system, but it just wasn't as good as I had hoped.

Part of the problem I think is also what made it interesting as the ""Epic Space Opera"" they were going for.  TOOOOO many characters, each with a good bit of time, dialogue and scenes to fill them in so that the main characters ended up feeling a tad under-used.

Sort of what happens when you do a set-up movie.  First Captain America for example, good flick but blah blah blah all the ""this is how he was created"" junk gets old and never really needs to be seen a second time.  Thus making repeat watchings (which are important to me in a great movie) less interesting.

A few things I was slightly annoyed with and didn't have me confused on whether it was my expectations warring with reality however are as follows (some spoilery stuff):

Collector was a wimp.  In the comics he's a pretty powerful immortal character in his own right, not just some Glamorously dressed rich guy with a collection fetish.  But when something happens on his home turf he's tossed around like a ragdoll as if he was a second rate chump.  I would have preferred some interesting gadget (cool diamond bling ring) to quickly erect a force field and protect him type of deal, or the entire thing just washing over him without a problem.

Nova corps were NOT like the comics.  Instead of a corp of super powered suit wearing individuals they were basically just space cops.  BORING.  Glenn Close as Nova Prime should have been powerful enough to blast space ships out of the sky on her own, and instead she's just basically a politician (and a particularly bad one considering how everyone ignores her whining).

Gamora seemed exceptionally weak to me.  I mean they intro her as this bad to the bone assassin wanted across the galaxy and then every second rate criminal with a prison shank gets the drop on her like she's a 3rd grade schoolgirl waiting for the bus to get to school.  Too many films make their characters look weak or stupid in order to flesh out the plot (we need some way for the Main Dude to save her!  I know, lets get her kidnapped by clueless twits!  Yay!) and I get the need to build drama, but a little more effort to make it look believable (don't let chumps auto-capture a super assassin off-screen) would have been nice.  Rewatching the scene a few times I realize a guard was in on the deal but that should have been made obvious in the film the first time through for example.

Anyhow, none of you want to hear me nitpick the entire thing, especially since I'm rating this 4 stars so I'll end on a point I was really glad they added.

Yondu rocks.  After 3 or 4 parts of the movie with him threatening people with his Whistle-Arrow I was psyched to see him actually use it to basically wipe out an entire squadron of Necrowhatevers in seconds.  Very sweet.",1418428800,,3108,4.38986013986014

Some of the biggies are Thanos , The Collector, Drax the Destroyer, Ronan the Accuser and Gamora (the most dangerous woman in the universe. Of course there are also the members of the group ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" . Membership in the group has morphed a bit from the original group the comprised The Guardians of The Galaxy , but this groups members are the current lineup in the current Marvel Series of this name. This group has a mission and they work at it with lots of action scenes and a lot of humor.  I am a comic junkie from way back (I read the original series by this name that ran in the 90's. I am a fan of nearly all of the Marvel super hero movies and I would have to place this movie fairly high on the list. I was particularly delighted to see Thanos - one of my heroes.

6919570,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Barely a week after its release this Marvel Comics actioner was already a marvel at the box office, earning almost twice its 170M production pricetag. And the critics love it too, something of an anomaly for comic book actioners! Watching it today, with a friend, there was no question in my mind about the reasons for its popularity and critical acclaim. With its fine screenplay, original characters, superb acting from an ensemble cast and James Gunn's masterful direction, this is not just a great sci/fi actioner; it's a great movie...one of the best released so far this year. Add to that some mind bending visuals and some of the best Sci/Fi humor since the original ""Star Wars""; and there's no doubt in my mind this will be a classic in its genre! Look for nifty performances from Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star-Lord; Zoe Saldana, in her best sci/fi role since ""Avatar"", as Gamora; Dave Bautista, as Drax the Destroyer; Vin Diesel who does the motion capture and voice for Groot, a dwarf, limited vocabulary version of the ""LOTR"" Ents; Bradley Cooper, who motion captures and voices the raccoon-like creature, Rocket; Lee Pace as the primary villain, Ronan the Accuser; and many others.

6919589,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Bias Alert!!! I own over 5000 comics, so anything from the Marvel or DC universes I have to see. But if you never read a comic in your life this is a truly enjoyable movie for the entire family. There is something for everyone, Sci-Fi, Action, comedy and the possibility for romance. I was not a collector or fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy and normally I can't stand action/comedies but this is an exception to that rule. The storyline was strong and they jumped right into it. All of the actors were convincing in their roles and you want to know more about all of them. Which means that they left plenty of room for a sequel. There is so much going on in this nonstop film that you have to watch it a few times to catch all of the things you missed. I saw it in the theatre and again on dvd this week as soon as it was released and I will see it again this weekend. P.S. - My wife loved it also and she dislikes my comic collection.",1418342400,,938,4.075675675675676

I especially loved Chris Pratt, and David Bautista (who I was prepared to dislike but turns out he was genius!) and had a very pleasant suprise in Karen Gillan as Nebula (although I would have loved to see more of her!)
The soundtrack, as everyone knows by now, is Awesome Mix Vol 1, and was almost another character in the movie. It IS in fact, an awesome mix tape :)
The CGI was amazing. I always feel like there is a certain amount of CGIness that has to be ignored in movies like this, or it takes me completely out of the movie. I did have that in this movie at all. In fact, I literally forgot that Rocket and Groot were not real people.  How do you forget that a talking raccoon and tree are not real?? I don't know, but I did!

6919604,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie tries to do it all and largely succeeds. The wild romp will jump from tearjerking heartache to hysterical comedy to intense action to tender romance all in a blink. While the tone is largely light and silly, there are still ample moments of dark emotion too. The semi-schizophrenic storytelling is only occasionally off-putting as the creators try to cram even more bang for the buck into the experience. Yet it's hard to complain about being gifted so many glowing jokes, bits and moments, even if some colorful backstory is awkwardly shoehorned into the wrong scene.

But overall the film is a tremendous success. The lively swings in plot and character make invincible killers become pushover weaklings, or humorless warriors turn into dorky comic relief. So there is a fantastic unpredictability to its proceedings despite trying to be all things to all people in this mega-blockbuster.

Every one of the five heroes is a winner, all ably displaying charisma, humor, compassion and cool domination. However, the clear standouts are Rocket and Groot, two fantastic inventions that will easily charm any viewer with their deceptive cuddliness and quirky toughness.

Sure, the movie can be sourly dissected as a carefully calculated amalgamation of past tropes and winning formulas (mix equal parts Indiana Jones, Star Wars, ""Avengers"" + love story for women + cute characters for kids/toys.) But to do so would overlook the fun ride of this intergalactic heist-adventure caper.

In my opinion, this is easily the best post-""Avengers"" Marvel movie, eclipsing the various sequels to Cap, Thor and Iron Man. While I still largely enjoyed those films, they occasionally felt like jumbled and bloated messes suffering from surfeits of side characters and subplots. But ""Guardians"" somehow bursts at the seams in just the right way.",1418342400,2,1839,5.223728813559322

Seriously, no option to purchase a bluray + dvd bundle?  My parents are older and comic book marvel movies are a big nostalgia hit for my dad.  I got them a blu-ray player for their living room last christmas, but, the rest of their house is still just dvd players.  Most modern movies have a two disc combo packs option of blu-ray + dvd, even including digital copy.  But not this movie?  So I either have to buy the blu-ray version and tell my dad he can only watch it on the new player in the living room, or buy the lower quality dvd version that he can watch anywhere in the house, or buy him both versions and explain why I had to get him two copies of the movie.",1418342400,13,812,4.193548387096774

I am glad Marvel pulls off different and odd stuff like this; unlike DC.
The film has the typical origin story but the characters are pretty unique; especially the film stealers: Rocket and Groot.
It is a funny film. It is an entertaining film. The only downside were the villains and the typical group who don't get along but do in the end. The music was okay too, not as great as everyone thinks ( I do dislike a few of the songs ) but I love that the songs fit the style/mood of the film and its characters.
In the end, a nice fun ride and something I expect from Marvel.

6919678,1,B00R8GUXPG,"First of All I absolutely love the film so this is in no way shape or form a reflection of the movie. The movie is awesome and you should watch it.

This is however a reflection of how poor a product the DVD version is (not the blu-ray). It clams, on the package that it has Bonus material and Deleted scenes. If by bonus they mean a bunch of commercials, ONE rough cut scene from the movie of the ""fake laugh"" and a 2 minute long behind the scenes for Avengers age of Ultron well I guess we have a much different opinion on what a bonus is. News Flash Disney, bonus are things people might actually want. Advertising is not a bonus, it's a nuisance.

I have yet to find on the DVD ANYWHERE any  ""Deleted Scenes""... I wish i had just bought the Blu-Ray eventho I don't have a blu-ray player which i suspect is what Disney wants everyone to buy. Don't waste the money on the DVD unless you're just looking for the film and nothing extra.

6919747,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Except that I'm not. No, it doesn't feature Chris Pratt firing lasers out of his eyes at a green space alien who retorts by shooting dubstep lightning(Amazing Spiderman 2, anyone?) out of her fingers. But regardless, Guardians Of The Galaxy is a fun movie, as Marvel continues its foray into mainstream cinema. Chris Pratt plays the ever-so-daring and witty Starlord who if I could describe him, I'd say he's the Jack Sparrow of the future.

The dialogue in this movie is hilarious, and there were many times in my theater when the audience and I joined together in uproarious laughter. But don't misinterpret my praise. This wasn't ""Oh, it's so bad that I laughed"". This is ""Oh, it's so good that I laughed."" The movie itself is a fun adventure, with just a slightly cliched story of a kid being abducted by aliens, and then setting out to have adventures in space with a crazy sociopathic mutated raccoon, a sexy green alien, a rage-a-holic bodybuilder, and uh, a tree..(No, you read that right.). But it's cliched in the best way. It's cliched in the way that when you were a kid, you probably wished you could go have wild space adventures too. It pretty much capitalizes on that very concept in the beginning of the movie.

And how could you get more awesome than this?! The aforementioned racoon, named Rocket..Coupled with its anthropomorphic tree-like alien named Groot, whose only dialogue in the whole movie is ""I am Groot."" Zoe Saldana plays as Gamora, an alien assassin trying to repent for her sins. Dave Bautista, who plays as Drax the Destroyer, a hulkish alien who literally takes things literally. And I mean literally. As far as plot details go, I'll let you figure that out yourself. But it does involve the much teased and cameo'd Thanos from Thor and The Avengers.

Guardians Of The Galaxy is one of Marvels most brilliant movies, and I urge everybody to give it a chance. My favorite part of the movie is Chris Pratt as his role Starlord(I even wish I had that nickname as a child). Also, be sure to watch the trailer for Jurassic World to see Chris Pratt riding alongside a pack of velociraptors.",1418256000,,2119,4.690860215053763

6919769,5,B00R8GUXPG,"It starts off with a real tear jerker scene but quickly moves on to become a fun movie and probably one of the best from Marvel. The music is good and the humor is grown up and in character. This is an action sci-fi type movie, There is a little crossover with the Thor movies, but only a tiny bit, so don't worry if you didn't like them, but it does make for some fun speculation as to what's to come. There is also a sequel planned, which is good since this was a good movie. About the only complaint I have is the cameos for Stan Lee are getting too obvious and it's really obvious he must have a clause inthe license that he must appear in every movie from Marvel.",1418169600,,668,4.068181818181818

6919792,1,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie reminded me of a cheap StarWars spin off.
It didn't have anything sexualized in nature that was a red flag. It didn't have anything in it that was overly gross/gory or torture-like scenes. It did of course have lots of slap stick type humor and alot of fighting. As all superhero movies-they decided to sacrifice themselves for other's well being.  What it did have that made the move a big fat ZERO for me was (I wouldn't even give it one star) a lot of filthy language. The whole film practically was littered with it. I can't stress this enough... lots of language. If you have kids, (or even if you don't) pass this up. Plenty of other stuff to watch that doesn't have that. The plot of the movie was mediocre at best. It wasn't terrible story wise, but it wasn't great either and was predictable. This is not a movie I'd watch twice, regardless of the language.

6919817,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Guardians of the Galaxy was my most enjoyable film of 2014.  The film starts off very emotional, but then swiftly shifts gears into an incredibly fun ride that hooks you from the very beginning to the end, but even after it's over you're just going to want to watch it again.  That being said the film as an top notch cast, but the best performances came from Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, and Michael Rooker (best known for his role as Merle Dixon in The Walking Dead).  On top of the acting being excellent, the music is just as good, and couldn't be anymore of a perfect match.  The music just adds tons of character to the movie, but more important is one of the best soundtracks in a movie that I've ever heard in a movie.

6919826,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Back when this movie first hit the theaters, I was one of those people who thought to themselves ""a talking raccoon & a walking tree, I think I'll pass"". Huge mistake!

After watching this movie last night, they were my two favorite characters! Rocket Raccoon and Groot have the best one-liners in the movie. All the characters had comedic lines, but those two were the funniest IMHO.

The rest of the cast were fantastic as well. Dave Bautista, the famous wrestler, did a fantastic job as Drax the Destroyer. Michael Rooker, better known as Darryl's racist brother on 'The Walking Dead' played his part to perfection as Yondu.

The soundtrack had some great music on it was well, all from the 1970s. I never understood what the cassette tape had to do with the story (in all the previews) but after watching, it all made perfect sense.

I can't wait for Part II and eventually Part III. Hopefully they'll also make an appearance in future Avengers movies as well.

Audio and video quality (on the Blu-Ray at least) were excellent. My 5.1 surround sound was shaking my living room between all the space battles, explosions, and Infinity Stone exposures LOL.

Highly recommended to anybody who loves (1) movies set in outer space, (2) comedies, (3) comic book nerds, and (4) a fan of any of the actors in the movie.",1418169600,,1314,4.691304347826087
6919827,1,B00R8GUXPG,"Black Bars SUCK!  Buying this DVD was infuriating! The fluctuating Aspect Ratio throughout the whole movie was excruciatingly painful.  I have a TV that I can zoom out the Black Bars in just about all cases but, not one that can automatically go back & forth.

I plan to take this back for an exchange and get a version that does not do this, if possible.  This totally screwed up a great movie experience.  I saw this at the show house and the screen was not like this!  This is unacceptable.  We used to have a choice with VHS, we had the ability to buy ""Full Screen"" versions, now it is force fed to all of us! How can we make the producers of this stuff feel our pain?

This has been going on, back as far back as LD's.  I don't care about a little better resolution and I don't care about the new 4K stuff either...  How many times do you need to get in may wallet? We want movies to fit our flat screens, thank you very much!

Totally disgusting & disappointing!

6919837,5,B00R8GUXPG,"""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Brash adventurer Peter Quill finds himself the object of an unrelenting bounty hunt after stealing a mysterious orb coveted by Ronan, a powerful villain with ambitions that threaten the entire universe. To evade the ever-persistent Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with a quartet of disparate misfits -- Rocket, a gun-toting raccoon, Groot, a tree-like humanoid, the deadly and enigmatic Gamora and the revenge-driven Drax the Destroyer. But when Quill discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses to the cosmos, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate stand -- with the galaxy's fate in the balance.

The cast led by Chris Pratt (in a funny star-making performance as Peter Quill), Zoe Saldana (as Gamora), Dave Bautista (as Drax), Vin Diesel (as the voice of Groot) & Bradley Cooper (as the voice of Rocket) is excellent. The directing by James Gunn is excellent. The story & screenplay (based on the comic book by Dan Abnett & Andy Lanning) by Gunn & Nicole Perlman is excellent.

The music by Tyler Bates is excellent. The cinematography by Ben Davis is excellent. The film editing by Fred Raskin, Hughes Winborne & Craig Wood is excellent. The casting by Sarah Halley Finn is excellent. The production design by Charles Wood is excellent. The art direction by Ravi Bansal, Ray Chan, Jordan Crockett, Romek Delmata, Alan Payne, Phil Sims, Mike Stallion & Mark Swain is excellent. The set decoration by Richard Roberts, set dressings by Adam Kedis, Mark Papworth & Brenden Salmon & set designs by Matthew Robinson is excellent. The costume design by Alexandra Byrne is excellent. The make-up supervised by Karen Cohen & special make-up effects coordinated by Fawn Muller & designed by David White is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Steve Dent is excellent. The special effects supervised by Paul Corbould are excellent. The visual effects supervised by Nicolas Aithadi, Stephane Ceretti, Vincent Cirelli, Trent Claus, Matthew Crnich, Jonathan Fawkner, James D. Fleming, Florian Gellinger, Kyle McCullough, Stephane Naze, Katherine Rodtsbrooks, Greg Steele, Olcun Tan & Peter G.

This is an excellent, fun (also funny), entertaining, sci-fi/action/adventure that is interesting and intriguing. It is also well-done and well-crafted, thematically and visually. Chris Pratt gives a funny and entertaining performance as Peter Quill and leads an excellent cast. James Gunn has directed his most interesting film to date, thus far.

6919853,4,B00R8GUXPG,"They're a band of misfits: a Terran mercenary; the emissary of a vicious warlord; a brutal prisoner bent on vengeance; and a conniving raccoon and his partner who's...mostly a tree.  Thrown together in the hunt for a mysterious orb, they are forced to band together to stop a rogue madman bent on destroying worlds.  In the process, they'll come to know each other, find what's really worth fighting for, and listen to some rockin' tunes.

Remember THE AVENGERS?  How Joss Whedon weaved together a world that was both fun and serious, with humor and heart and something truly at stake?  GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is all of that, minus the real danger.  Oh, it starts out with you at the edge of your seats; but by the halfway point, when things start to take their ultimate shape, you understand that this isn't THAT kind of movie.  Which, you know what, is okay.  Sometimes, it's good to just have some fun.  You've got a wisecracking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper; what more could you want from life?

The cast is strong.  Chris Pratt solidifies his star power as the leader of our misfits, with Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Cooper and Vin Diesel (in voice roles, although Diesel is almost a non-presence) holding their own as his counterparts.  Lee Pace makes a menacing villain, until he has nothing left to do but grunt and make menacing gestures.  Michael Rooker was a welcome surprise (as he usually is), and Glen Close, John C. Reilly, and Djimon Hounsou do great in their small roles.  (Also: look for Josh Brolin.  That's all I'm gonna say.)  The real scene-stealer is Benicio del Toro, who only has one scene (minus the post credits scene, which is just dandy) but pretty much steals the whole movie with his performance.  Which is basically par for the course.

James Gunn has proven before that he's a director to watch; SLITHER remains a personal favorite of mine.  He knows how to make movies fun.  There's not much truly at stake in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, which is a bit of a downfall (hence the half-star); however, this movie is fun, fun, fun.  You know how it'll end up, but at least you've got a ragtag bunch of antiheroes to root for.  Also, the soundtrack, which actually plays a significant role in the film.  Put in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, sit back, have some popcorn, maybe a beer if you're of age and mind, and just enjoy.",1418083200,,2351,4.612048192771084

6919896,4,B00R8GUXPG,"I didn't see this in theaters and really had no expectations for this being a good movie. I figured it would be on par with something like the first Fantastic Four movie; hollow characters, watered down action sequences, and set in a narrow reality. I must say this was nothing like that and is actually a really good movie. Humor, action, well thought out costume design, and set within the larger reality of the ""Marvel Universe"". The CG characters were actually very believable and showed character development, which typically doesn't happen in these types of movies. I think the only character that needed a little more development was Ronan, the bad guy. The plot could have used a few more twists and turns as well, and perhaps been a tad darker. Overall though, comic book geeks seem pleased with this movie, but at the same time people not as familiar with this story line and characters will also enjoy the movie. Oh, an this is not exactly a little kid movie...not really suited for kids under 10 in my opinion.",1418083200,,1022,4.683333333333334

From the casting and direction to special effects, CGI, make-up wardrobe, editing, production design, lighting and sound a very fun action story that was well written was well produced, no less a task than saving the universe! Guardians of the Galaxy will be seen as the Star Wars of the twenty first century.
Every character was gifted with great dialogue and all the actors in this fast paced story rose to the the challenge of the writing. While keeping it real they moved through the verbal word play like ninjas. I felt this was a familiar story that was, at the same time, new to me.

Plenty of humor, action, wisecracking characters to give you a fun sci fi action film.  Well done, easy to follow story line, and good action sequences keep the movie moving along at a good pace while giving you a feel for the characters.  Well worth watching, an entertaining film.  Five crazy characters come together to form the Guardians of the Galaxy.

This doesn't make it a bad movie by any means, and it is certainly entertaining.  I am mostly giving it 3 stars because this movie was greatly hyped and I think it wasn't warranted.  It's a nice departure from the usual Marvel super hero movies.  But, it's not better than most of them.

And by the time you are through seeing this movie I promise you will be tired of hearing ""I am Groot"".  I found that gag to be old very fast.",1418083200,,601,4.033898305084746

6920007,4,B00R8GUXPG,"Marvel and Disney give the gift that keeps on giving all year round with the release of Guardians of the Galaxy on 3D and regular Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Download. Although high expectations were had by both studios, I was up in the air until seeing it in theaters. Why would anyone want to see a movie about a bunch of characters no one is familiar with flying around the universe? Thankfully, I was wrong. What we get is an exhilarating space opera with enough connections to the Avengers to pull in a mainstream crowd hungry for more super hero escapades.

Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) was abducted by intergalactic mercenaries moments after his mother died of cancer. He grew into manhood searching the universe for valuable items to sell to different collectors of all species. After finding a mysterious orb, it seems like everyone in the known galaxy is hunting him down to take possession of it... including the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin). Quill puts together a team of misfits to keep the object out of the villain's deadly clutches.

The Blu-ray edition of Guardians of the Galaxy is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1). The picture is pristine and clean and offers the trademark clarity we expect from both Marvel and Disney. Instead of being limited by clean video and showing off its limitations, the CGI is actually enhanced and looks better than ever.

A 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix guarantees that home audiences are thrown right into the thick of intergalactic battles. Lasers bounce around the room while starships blaze in different directions. All of these sound effects are balanced beautifully with the humorous dialogue and Tyler Bates bombastic musical score.

The Blu-ray version of Guardians of the Galaxy posesses some entertaining special features. James Gunn provides audio commentary for the film. The 21-minute documentary Guide to the Galaxy with James Gunn goes behind the scenes and takes an insiders look at the production. The featurette The Intergalactic Visual Effects includes interviews with the cast and crew. The sneak peek at Avengers: Age of Ultron is much too short clocking in at 2 minutes. Deleted and extended scenes and a gag reel finish out the extra.

Guardians of the Galaxy is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language. There are also quite a few sexual innuendos younger children won't pick up on but older ones might. The violence is on par with the Star Wars movies wheres there isn't a lot of blood or gore.

Even in a home theater setting, Guardians of the Galaxy will tantalize viewers with its mix of wit, humor, and sci-fi action. It truly is the Star Wars of a new generation. At least until Star Wars: Episode VII  The Force Awakens comes out next year. The Blu-ray is the version most Marvel fanatics will want to pick up thanks to a healthy dose of great bonus material.

Guardians of the Galaxy is available now on 3D Blu-ray, DVD, and as a Digital Download.",1418083200,,2986,4.8641732283464565

6920046,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie obviously doesn't need my two penny worth with these reviews, and the highest box office of 2014 more or less clinches it. This is a wonderful movie - great relief to have a relaxed almost spoof treatment of the super hero theme. Having just endured the new Superman, Man of Steel, which took itself so, so seriously, The Guardians was a breath of fresh air. So lateral thinking does exist at Marvel Studios.

I actually think these preposterous creations - against which I have a few reservations based upon George Orwell's analysis (and American society where this genre was born) in his famous essay - actually work much better with a few drops of the engine oil of self mockery and parody. Spiderman and especially Ironman (which albeit is mind numbingly dull despite the increasingly tight lipped quips) seem to have learnt that lesson, also the Fantastic Four. But perhaps as standard bearer for the franchise Superman has to take himself seriously. He, he he...

Thank God for the gloriously funny Guardians. Thoroughly enjoyable - I even shed a tear when the Tree Man ""died"" that's the magic of the movies - and more, more, more please!",1417996800,,1155,4.798994974874372

It's great to see a movie based on some lesser known comics do so well. Every one was well cast and overall seemed to enjoy doing the movie. Vin Diesel is great with so little. A greatly fun movie.

We originally saw this in the theater, but I struggled keeping the 3D glasses on my 4 year old, so I was a bit distracted and didn't love the movie.  I loved it much more (so much more that I couldn't understand why I didn't love it so much the first time) when we watched it in 2D at home.  In fact, we turned around and watched it again the next day, and the day after, and now I'm ready to watch it again.

This is a family-friendly Marvel Adventure based on the comics.  Kind of fun to have less-glamorous less-than-strictly-amazing-super-heros banding together to form The Guardians of the Galaxy... a quirky team that bands together and becomes super-heros in their own rights by the end of the movie.",1417737600,4,902,4.377245508982036

6920269,5,B00R8GUXPG,"In 2014 Marvel hit another 2 massive grand slam home runs with the movies they brought out. We had the magnificent ""Captain America : Winter Soldier"" which I could write volumes about in praise of but hey that's for its own review section. Then we had the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" released and there was glowing pleasure and enjoyment all around! I will be honest, when I first heard Marvel were going ahead with a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie I was very sceptical about it, why would they spend money on  what I considered a relatively unknown team from the 1970's, I thought the original team were okay as characters and I enjoyed their linking up with the Avengers. However  I was totally ignorant and unaware of the new team which of course consisted of Star Lord, Drax, Gamora, Rocket Racoon and the irrepressible Groot! From the moment I saw the first trailer of the movie I was instantly and totally hooked! ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was the first movie I have seen in 3D, what an experience. What this movie had which shone like a diamond was that it had a massive big heart, we cared about the characters, they are misfits with hearts of gold and I think everything clicked into place with this movie. The casting was perfect, Chris Pratt as Star Lord, perfect choice, a likeable ratbag, Zoe Saldana the ideal Gamora, Bradley Cooper voicing Rocket, nobody can be as sarcastic or as endearing, Vin Diesel made us care about a character who only uttered 3 things, bravo Groot and the revelation in this elite group, Dave Bautista as Drax, who knew he had such a wonderful sense of timing in his comedic actions, he was fabulous! Look I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this movie, there were scenes of fantastic comedy ""your pelvic sorcery"", ""nothing goes over my head"", ""you have a plan"", fantastic laugh out moments. The comedy is balanced up by the heart felt compassionate scenes, Rocket begging Groot not to sacrifice his life, Drax consoling Rocket by patting him on the back of the head, such heartfelt moments, so well handled. The soundtrack is to die for, from the incredible start of the movie with 10CC's sublime ""I'm not in Love""  to the joyous ""I want you Back""  by the Jackson 5 playing at the end the movie soundtrack is another perfect element to this joyous movie. Word must be made of the support actors, the ever reliable John C Reily, Glen Close, Michael Rooker and Benicio Del Toro as The Collector perfectly round of the stellar cast.",1417651200,,2479,4.601809954751131

As an action movie, this movie has it all, villains, damsels in distress, an overarching power that threatens to destroy the universe, and a personal struggle exhibited by each of the leading characters that is coincidentally similar to one another.  It is especially noteworthy that the lead characters (with such different backgrounds from each other) are able to come together as a team and accomplish something noteworthy.  Great movie for teens and older although I doubt very many younger than the age of 30 would understand some of the character references and those younger than 14 would probably not get some of the plot points.",1417651200,,759,5.146341463414634

What if my kids grow up to believe that it is OK to have loveless sex with a bunch of blue/purple/green women because of this kinda extraterrestrial trash?

No comic book person well maybe the two or three remembered who ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is. If they claim they have always been fans they are liars. No one knew what to expect of this and that is the beauty of the film. This movie besides being downright fun and enjoying to watch as a team space opera is an amazing set up. With a great cast doing all their parts with excellence, this is a funny action packed and rich world building film. This movie sets in place a universe for Marvels Films that is infinite. Guardians makes you forget you are watching a talking raccoon with a mean streak and a living plant tree thing with a huge heart. Pratt as Quill nails the role and sets the tone right off. This is definitely a great pizza night movie! Marvel took a title no one remembered or cared about and just blasted it out of this world!",1417478400,,1006,4.3563829787234045

Ive never read the comic (I don't read any comics) and I was initially sceptical of a Racoon being a leading character.  The Racoon is actually believable in the setting of the story and plays an integral part in the movie.  Groot alone is worth the price of admission!

6920517,5,B00R8GUXPG,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" introduces to movie audiences a set of 45-year-old Marvel characters that, unlike Spider-Man, Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man, are from the more obscure branch of the Marvel family tree. The Guardians are Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), also known as Starlord; green-hued Gamora (Zoe Saldana); muscle-bound, dim-witted Drax (Dave Bautista); angry raccoon warrior Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper); and a masterful CGI creation, the walking humanoid tree Groot (voice of Vin Diesel).

The plot is familiar. A galactic villain wants to obtain a mystical object -- the infinity stone -- that will give him the power to rule the universe. For assorted reasons, the Guardians are determined to stop him.

What makes the movie unique is its lighthearted tone, far from the seriousness that infuses not only Marvel superheroes, but those of the DC universe as well. The Guardians are an unlikely alliance. They bicker, wisecrack, fight, and seem to have conflicting agendas until they reluctantly decide that uniting in their common cause is superior to going it alone.

Pratt, who has been a reliable ""friend of the main character"" in such films as ""Delivery Man"" and ""Her,"" finally gets to be the star, and the role of Peter Quill suits him. Reminiscent of Indiana Jones, with a touch of Han Solo thrown in for good measure, Quill is a mercenary given to listening to a mix tape given to him by his mother on her death bed. His use of a Sony Walkman is delightfully anachronistic and adds a nice touch to an otherwise futuristic world. Quill is a young man with an old soul. He is more sensitive than his patter and exploits reveal, but the viewer is let in on his little secret, which humanizes a character that might otherwise have been merely another hunky, generic space hero. Quill is flawed, often unsure of himself, and funny -- qualities that work for the character and create balance with the movie's action and special effects.

Rocket, the raccoon, is an angry, embittered creature, quick on the trigger and often acting on emotion rather than careful reasoning. The others often have to reign him in. Mr. Cooper adds a kind of sadness to his persuasive interpretation. His Rocket is a tough-talking scrapper who bears considerable hurt. Though the CGI is terrific, it's Cooper's nuanced voice work that allows us to see Rocket as more than a visual joke.

The most incredible CGI achievement is Groot, the tree, whose entire vocabulary consists of ""I am Groot."" Groot may have been inspired by Chewbacca in the ""Star Wars"" series. Huge and powerful, he proves to be a valuable part of the team despite his limited language ability. He differs from Chewbacca in that he possesses magical powers, which are revealed at key moments in the story. Diesel's voice work is necessarily limited, but his deep basso is the right match for the walking tree with a surprisingly expressive ""face.""

Ms. Saldana""s Gamora is a tough gal in the mold of Emma Peel in TV's ""The Avengers"" or Trinity in ""The Matrix."" She holds up her end of the action while conveying a vulnerability. She's an alien woman raised by a super-villain as an assassin. Aware of the evil she's been forced into, she wants to make amends and redeem herself. Ms. Saldana is probably one of few actresses who can look alluring in mint-green skin.

""Guardians of the Galaxy"" features supporting performances by Michael Rooker as a blue-skinned bandit and father figure to Quill, Djimon Hounsou as a feared intergalactic bounty hunter, Glenn Close as the leader of Nova Corps, whose mission is to protect her planet, and John C. Reilly as a Nova Corps officer.

Director James Gunn wisely chose to focus on the characters rather than the plot, which isn't all that engaging. We've seen it before in one form or another. The characters, however, are new to the screen and fascinating. Because ample time is devoted to their back stories and interaction, the movie experience is rewarding.

Rated PG-13, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a clever picture that goes beyond traditional superhero movies. The heroes here are misfits who clash with each other as well as with outside forces. The story is a clever showcase to introduce this colorful quintet to a hoped-for new and profitable franchise.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include deleted scenes, making-of featurettes, gag reel, digital copy, and a preview of ""Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron.""",1417392000,2,4448,4.926568758344459

6920668,1,B00R8GUXPG,"I saw this in the theater with my kids. Was without a doubt Marvels greatest movie to date. Had everything I could have asked for in acting, action, drama, and more. Effects were spot on and didn't look trashy or too CG. I thought this was Vin Diesels greatest acting moment on film (haha).

All in all, I was mighty impressed and wanted to pre-order this the moment it was released. Would easily have given it a 5 star rating. BUT...

... why exactly would you have an exclusive Blu-ray only and DVD only package? Almost every film released in recent years have gone with a Blu-ray + DVD combo. Even re-releases of old 80's films have given us the ability to have both formats.

I'm stuck. I have a dying PS3 that will likely not last long. Can't afford a standalone Blu-ray player (nor a TV to make real good use of it). I have a DVD player in another part of the house that I use as a backup in case the PS3 refuses to work, but have to move it around the house if I want it to play in another room. It was always so convenient for us to get the combos.

I can either buy one or the other... and be S.O.L. Or, I could wait and see if some Ultimate Super Special Directors Edition comes out that might have both. Either way, this was a poor move on the publisher/studios part and now I'm stuck with a decision I really didn't need to make.

I know I'll probably get this review voted down for going with one star... but I absolutely can't overlook this. The industry standard is to box both together. Have another Blu-ray + 3D combo for all I care. But don't do this nonsense to your viewers.",1417392000,8,1594,4.196078431372549

6920673,2,B00R8GUXPG,I really had high hopes for this movie but it was just not good! A few moments were funny but not fond of any characters and writing in movie sucked. You never find out in this movie who leads characters father was and it is only mentioned in the start and at the end. I was not impressed with any of the acting.,1417392000,3,312,3.9682539682539684

I actually really enjoyed the extras, it was basically a ""making-of"" documentary, but I thought that it was very well put together. It of course had commentary from James Gunn, the cast, and a few others who worked on the film.

6920804,3,B00R8GUXPG,"There is a primary femme in Guardians of the Galaxy, but she is basically another Black Widow variant. The movie almost should've been called ""Male Guards of the Galaxy"" as even the freaking TREE is characterized as a male. I wouldn't be so torqued about this were it not for the fact that the Marvel movies have been so misogynistic in general.

Michael Rooker was funnier than he has been in years, that's a big plus is my book. Chris Pratt was unfortunately miscast - he should've voiced Groot, while Vin Diesel should've played Star Lord (instead of voicing Groot). Follow what I'm saying? Maybe the sequel will kick this thing into overdrive because what we have here is easy to watch but not very memorable.",1417219200,2,713,4.658730158730159

6920834,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Excellent Si-fi movie with a twist on the same old same old you see today.  Great music, unforgettable characters and great comedic acting making this a must see for any age.  No nudity, swearing minimal, so ideal for any age.  Never remember seeing Chris Pratt in a movie, but he was the ideal cast as Starlord for the title role, his smile is infectious as his humor, even the green Gamora is not overdone in being such a bad ass, though her sister Nova was actually quite cool as an evil villain in the thriller.

My guess is that you will love it as much as the many who already say they do.  I am sure there is going to be a sequel, no doubt. While we are on the topic of Sc-fi just though I would mention, IMO, I say the new Star Wars trailer and was SOOOO disappointed.  Was that the best they can come up with an epic movie chain, or is this the end now that Disney owns it.  I hope the Force Awakens trailer was just having a bed head with that preview.

Take care and thanks for reading.",1417219200,,997,4.103092783505154

6921088,3,B00R8GUXPG,"I will start off by saying, I am not a comic book kind of guy, didn't read them when I was a kid and definitely wouldn't as an adult. There are MANY ""comic book"" movies that I THOROUGHLY enjoyed, if not outright loved (Avengers, Captain America, Thor) I tend to base them on the movie itself, verse a preconceived idea of how it ""should"" be. With that said, this movie could have been epic and lost it based on the music selection alone. I am a byproduct of the time period and while I recognized the songs ... none of them sent me wheeling down memory lane to bring a smile to my face. There were sooooo many more songs from that timeline that would have been perfect for many of those scenes and instead we got someones truly lame playlist. To those that connected with the music, sorry there were better that could have been used and SHOULD have been used. Yes, this seems trivial but it honestly isn't given how the music is used in the movie (avoiding spoiler territory).

TL;DR ... It isn't a bad movie, it just failed to connect with me through the music which they were attempting to do.",1417132800,,1095,4.341463414634147

The bonus features are worth watching. For the first time in years, we actually watched all the way through and were entertained - even amazed at the making of the film.",1417132800,,384,4.579710144927536

6921094,4,B00R8GUXPG,"People have been telling me I have to see this movie. They've been chanting Groot. Why?

I get it now. I think that Groot is a rebel of his people. The adventurer in a (pardon me) planted society. Good thing they're joyful and peaceful. That's some mighty hefty abilities he's totin'. Yeah, I agree. Groot rocks.

The rest of the picture isn't bad either. The detail in the background made a very believable world that clipped along and kept me interested.

Makes me want to space travel.

Go ahead and watch it, it's a good time. I'm glad they're going to make another. I hope they make it soon.",1417046400,2,596,4.440366972477064

6921106,5,B00R8GUXPG,"Easily one of the most enjoyable movie viewing experiences I've had with Marvel. Every character had so much life, and so much heart. I really liked the talking raccoon. What I've give to have one of those around the house. He's a little marmot, and helps out the team so much. I've got a 31 year old human man living under my roof, and he doesn't do half of what that cute little fuzzy guy does. Loved the movie, a lot of fun!",1417046400,,427,4.156626506024097

6921110,5,B00R8GUXPG,"The movie was absolutely fantastic. I never read the old comics about them so was on the fence about watching the movie but very glad I did now. As one reviewer put it: it reminded me of seeing Star Wars for the first time. Great acting and just a fun, lighthearted script with universal destruction undertones.

Now as for Amazon Instant Video they get 1 star or less. I pre-ordered this title a while back but, like many, I ordered the SD version to save a couple of bucks. When they released the movie early, they only released the HD version while the SD people have to wait until Dec 9th. This is just another data point in an ongoing pattern of playing games with the customers. It started when they decided that new movies can't be rented right away you instead have to either buy the movie or wait for several weeks until they decide you can rent it. Really? Keep it up Amazon and I'll just hop over to one of your competitors instead. The barrier to switching instant video vendors is very low as is my tolerance for games.",1417046400,,1032,4.375

6921113,5,B00R8GUXPG,"This movie reminds me how I felt the first time I saw Star Wars.  I saw it twice in theaters and paid the Amazon HD price to watch it again because I didn't want to wait for the DVD to come out.  The dialogue is great, the humor is great, the sex is kid-friendly, the villains are engaging and pure evil, the science is completely unrealistic.  It's just fun.  No deep philosophy.  Get your popcorn and settle in.",1417046400,,413,4.243589743589744

6921132,5,B00R8GUXPG,"After seeing it both in theater and at home, I think Guardians of the Galaxy is the most entertaining movie of 2014. The characters are extremely likable, the plot is interesting but not so convoluted that it's difficult to follow as many sci-fi movies are. Plus it has just the right mix of humor and drama. Special effects are excellent. Kids will enjoy this movie (it is PG) because of the racoon and Groot, but there's lots in it for adults to like as well. The test of a good movie is that it is just as good on home video as on the big screen and this movie passes with flying colors.",1416960000,,590,4.230088495575221

I saw part 2 before this one on a well-known movie streaming service, but I would recommend watching part 1 first. Part 2 is actually better in my opinion since it has baby Groot.",1534118400,,471,4.413793103448276
