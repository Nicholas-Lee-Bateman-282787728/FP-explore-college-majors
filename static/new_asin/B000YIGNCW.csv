3029548,1,B000YIGNCW,"This movie falls on the low end of the ""B"" movie spectrum and fails to deliver on every level.  The characters are almost totally unsympathetic, mismatched in their marriage, and irrational in their behavior.  The ""science"" involved in the explanations of the ""dirty"" bombs is garbage.  First, it's just unexplained, then it's toxins from the burning buildings, then it's a virus.  It not only defies the common understanding of a ""dirty"" bomb, which involves radioactive materials, but changes itself in order to lead to a contrived ending.  Moreover, the core plot supposes that one or more individuals can live in a totally duct-tape sealed building for more than a few hours, which was proven wrong in tragic deaths in New York following 9-11, so it gives bad suggestions for surviving a dirty bomb.  There are no elements of a good story either; no lessons learned, no catharctic moments, no character growth or development, and no satisfaction either in the process nor the resolution.  Run away from it like it's a toxin.",1202515200,9,1028,4.976608187134503
3029549,5,B000YIGNCW,"This is a must see! Riveting! It will have you on the edge of your seat, and make you think about your government... and your relationships. Very philosophical. Thoughtful, entertaining and terrifying! A great flick.",1201824000,,216,5.2
3029550,1,B000YIGNCW,"I'll start by saying that I didn't finish the movie, so if you're the type of person who invalidates reviews based on whether someone saw it to the finish line, you'll find nothing of interest here.

Right at Your Door is intellectually dishonest and emotionally cheap.  It presents characters who might work in a pure allegory, but not in a movie that tries to suggest that their reactions are any approximation of what real people might do in a premise involving a biological attack.

Director Chris Gorak, who has received so much praise for his efforts here, doesn't seem to have a coherent moral vision, or even an opinion.  He's more like Eli Roth, a bit of a sloppy misanthrope, a man who believes that our least desirable impulses are important enough to propel a narrative.

During the 45 minutes I could stand of this rubbish, so many visceral reactions emerged.  How can anyone be so stupid and needy that their base instinct is to drive into deep danger to save a girlfriend?  Think about it.  Rational human beings won't just swallow the garbage sensational radio voices spew at them -- unless they are as stupid and cliched as the sheeple Gorak seems to think we are.  This is where the dishonesty and cheapness of the film really rear their head -- only an incredibly stupid person would race toward a bombed zone to save one person -- I don't care how many romantic fairy sprinkles you throw at the situation.

If someone inside your house, during a municipal crisis, told you that you couldn't come into your own home, would you not, as a right-bearing, survival-keen property owner (or even renter) do everything in your power to bust into your own home?  Nobody will ever keep me out of my house without a fight, but Gorak expects us to sit through endless doorway conversations while a weak male character (who can cry on cue) and a weak female character (who should shatter every window in that house to get in) make decisions based on either 1) no information or 2) fuzzy, empty radio information.

The characters lack roundness.  Gorak is not interested in their extended lives other than to offend us with a rude, irrational, and completely implausible moment when the male character hangs up (!) on his missing girlfriend's mother, a woman who only wants the comfort of knowing what's going on.  This male character spends endless airwaves and battery cycles calling and calling his girlfriend, as if she is the only person in the world.  Sorry, filmmakers, but most of us have other important people in our lives, people we'd want to call: moms, dads, siblings, the list goes on.

The real reason I could not finish this movie is that it assumes we have no ingenuity whatsoever and are now completely (d)evolved sycophants in the Bush era.  We wait for what the radio tells us.  We don't know anything about biological warfare.  We duct-tape our windows even though that advice is unsound.  We can't put together a simple plan.

The movie and its makers think we just fell off a Christmas tree.",1201651200,5,3020,4.7034220532319395
3029551,5,B000YIGNCW,"We lived in Florida during the Cuban missle crisis and instead of ducking and covering under our desks we went out in the hallway and huddled against the wall during our nuclear attack drills.  When I was growing up it was pretty much taken for granted that one day the Cold War was going to go nuclear.  There were movies from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Beach/dp/B00004SGB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Beach</a>"" to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fail-safe/dp/B00004XPPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fail-safe</a>"" that played out possible scenarios for the end of the world as we knew it, and even ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B0002JJBZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>"" assumed that World War III was going to be a nuclear war.  When ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After/dp/B0001WTVUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After</a>"" came out Carl Sagan was on the special edition of ""Nightline"" that followed saying that a real nuclear winter would be much worse than what we say in that made for television movie.  But now we live in a world where a full out nuclear exchange between two super powers seems extremely remote if not impossible and we would like to believe that a terrorist attack involving nuclear weapons is not inevitable.  We have seen such a scenario played out with super Agent Jack Bauer on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B00008YGRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>,"" but that never really involves ordinary people.  That is not the case with ""Right at Your Door,"" which plays out against our worst fears at a very basic level.

Brad (Rory Cochrane) and Lexi (Mary McCormack) are living together in Los Angeles and on this fateful morning she goes off to work.  The next thing Brad nows there are reports on the radio of a series of blasts in the city.  It turns out that not only is this a terrorist attack, but that the bombs were dirty bombs that are filling the air with toxic clouds of deadly ash.  Of course Brad tries to contact Lexi, but the phone lines are jammed and when he jumps in his car to try and go and find her, his efforts are thwarted by the police.  Chances are she is already dead, but Brad simply does not know one way or the other.  So he returns home and seals up his doors and windows against the toxic cloud that is coming, and waits for Lexi to call or get back home.

This turns out to be only the grim opening act of first-time writer-director Chris Gorak's film, which was screened at Sundance in 2006 and only grossed $64K when it was released for a few weeks last year.  Now that it is out on DVD, word of mouth should help ""Right at Your Door"" get a much larger audience, because this is an engrossing little film.  One aspect of the film's low budget is that instead of television coverage of what is going on, all we and the characters get are radio broadcasts.  However, this ends up working in the film's favor as our imagination fills in the grim details, as do the simply sights of black clouds of smoke and the rain of ash particles.  More money would not have improved the finished product and most of the story plays out in and around the home that Brad and Lexi share.  There is also an echo of 9/11 in how family and friends reach out by cell phone.

The film that ""Right at Your Door"" reminds me most of in terms of these apocalyptic films ends up being ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Testament/dp/B00062IDJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Testament</a>,"" the harrowing story of a family trying to survive in the aftermath of a nuclear war far enough away from the destruction, but not far enough away from the fallout.  ""Testament"" has a much longer time-frame than ""Right at Your Door,"" but it shares the same intimate focus.  Overall I liked the way things played out in the end (I certainly was not expecting that particular resolution), although the set up for the end game did strike me as a bit strange when it was happening.  That was the one bit that immediately struck me as unbelievable that under those circumstances the cell phone (this reference will make sense when you see the film) would be an issue worth pursuing.  I was going to round down on the film because of that flaw, but you know me.  I think irony is the master trope of the universe and when you surprise me with an ironic twist at the end of the story I end up rounding up.

The DVD extras include the scripts for a pair of alternative endings for the film, and it is heartening to think that at least Gorak did not film either one of them, because I am getting tired of filmmakers getting to the ending of their flms and picking options (just take any of the classic films of your choice, imagine alternative endings, and shudder accordingly).  This is an effective little film, and while I would not call it great, it certainly deserves to be seen by more people than have caught it to date.  That is why I have talked in general terms about the opening act and left the other two-thirds of the movie for you to discover for yourself.",1201651200,34,5275,5.089327146171693
3029552,5,B000YIGNCW,"Although produced on an independent budget, the filmmakers here have created a fantastic thriller.  Set in Los Angeles, the film starts out as every day in our lives does, until that is, an unknown terrorist organization sets off a series of dirty bombs in the downtown area.  Recalling the panic that set in on 9/11, our main characters don't know what to do, who to trust, or where to find credible information.  What ensues is a truly scary proposition of what might happen, police declare marshall law, hospitals become traps for unwilling victims, and general chaos follows.  The performance of Rory Cochrane is really what drives this tale, as he might finally get the recognition he deserves as a dramatic actor, after appearing in such films as Dazed & Confused, and A Scanner Darkly for the past 10 years, as well as CSI: Miami.  The supporting cast is excellent as well, although it only takes a few poeple to drive this story, an element of its genius.  I won't give away the ending, but it is definitely a twist you don't see coming.  Some might not want to see a movie about what might possibly happen in the future, but I think that would be missing the point.  We need to ask ourselves what we would do as a society, so we don't end up like the characters in the movie, if it ever does happen.",1201651200,18,1308,4.512711864406779
3029553,5,B000YIGNCW,"Why this incredibly crafted and relavent movie was never in wide release eludes me. I attend the Sundance Film Festival every year and see many films that ultimately have become quite famous. This film deserves just as much, if not more, fame as ""Little Miss Sunshine"", ""Hustle and Flow"" among others. It still ranks as one of the most unforgettable and original movies I have ever seen.

Why this didn't get a theatrical release I don't know, definately one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.  I actually watched this movie thinking it was a zombie movie, I had no idea what it was actually about.  It plays off your fears of current events with the bUSH administration & our war on terror.  This really is one of the most terrofying movies I've ever seen!!  The movie starts out with a couple just waking up in the morning & the woman hurrying off to work in downtown LA.  The man stays home when multiple explosions take place all over the downtown LA area.  I really feel like I should say more about the plot, but don't want to spoil anything for anyone.  The acting is absolutely superb, & the movie is filmed the way ""28 Days/Weeks"" is filmed for that more realistic kinda feel.  It's perfectly made to eat away at every American's fears made so prominent by bUSH's republican reich, you'll all be terrified by the end of the movie.  Seriously though, I think this movies gonna go down as one of the most underrated films ever, this movie deserves to be seen by lots & lots of people.  This movie should be up for awards & deserves a spot on your own personal DVD shelf.  BUY THIS MOVIE!!!

3029593,4,B000YIGNCW,"Other reviewers have covered the plot, the Indie script and the acting quality and direction.

As a premise, this is an all too plausible scenario--a dirty bomb, and unprepared civilians caught unawares and scrambling to cope.

The unemployed musician beta-male obediently tapes up the house with duct tape as the Government voices on the radio instruct him to do. Obediently he refuses to allow his (obviously contaminated) wife into the sealed house, as the Government told him to do.
And ultimately he is killed by officials of that same Government. You could make a libertarian argument out of this film, along with a decline of American manhood argument, and the script suggests both.

Ultimately it's a very bleak film with a fatal ending. Much of the dialog is pretty mundane and forgettable. None of the characters are remotely likable, even though their predicament is tragic and it's obvious that one or both are doomed.

None of the loose plot threads--who did this, why, what else is happening in the larger world outside-- are ever explained or resolved. That's not artsy or enigmatic, it's just sloppy scripting. And it makes this a just-OK film, but not the powerful cult classic it could have become with a better, smarter script and tighter, less self-indulgently directionless editing.

Four Stars for the concept, and the effective atmosphere (pardon the pun) of doomed claustrophobia and powerlessness.

I wouldn't care to own it. But for free streaming, it has some moments amid the bleakness. Obviously, this is not a first-date movie.

Hope this review was helpful. Enjoy!",1407369600,,1595,5.088122605363985
3029594,3,B000YIGNCW,"In Right At Your Door (2006), the population of southern California unexpectedly faces an unknown biological threat, and one man finds himself sealed inside his home, waiting for answers.  Some minor spoilers follow.

Brad (Rory Cochrane,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oculus/dp/B00KNVF3US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oculus</a>) is at home when he learns that dirty bombs have been dropped in LA.  He heads out to search for his wife Lexi (Mary McCormack,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Plain-Sight/dp/B001QUXNQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Plain Sight</a>) but is turned back by the police.  Returning home, Brad finds a laborer named Alvaro (Tony Perez) in his home, and together they apply duct tape over the openings in the walls, and tape plastic sheeting over the windows, sealing themselves inside.

Lexi does return home, but has been exposed, and is forced to remain outside.  Most of the action is confined to the house, but matters proceed rather slowly, until the army appears on the scene.  Although a terrible fate is anticipated, what happens will probably take most by surprise.

Written and directed by Chris Gorak, Right At Your Door features some good performances, as the story follows a pretty credible path, in regards to how a catastrophic event like this might unfold.  That said, realistic doesn't always make for the most engrossing watch.  Nothing really amazing happens, and the downbeat ending won't be to everyone's liking, but for those interested in ""outbreak"" tales, this film is certainly worth a look while it is available on Prime.

3029609,1,B000YIGNCW,"I added this to my watch list because there was a few 4-5 star reviews on it.

Warning: Spoiler alerts below.

This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Let start with random fade to black, meaningless scene transitions? I have seen a fair amount of low budget films, but this is just a lack of creativity and most of the time the use of it is absolutely meaningless. In the last (~20m?) of the movie, there is about 6 of them in which the main characters never move, they are just having conversation, and the screen fades to black and reopens with them in the same effing spot. Maybe they were trying to go for dramatics? I have no idea.

But that brings us to random shaky screen effects. It adds absolutely nothing to the movie (except maybe motion sickness for the audience) when the screen is shaking like the cameraman is jogging on a treadmill trying to film the video. Though, that may have had more to do with the trend that was occurring while this film was being made.

The plot:
It is like a middle school student had to write an essay for an English class and did it the night before. Save for a bit of a twist at the end, it is the most underdeveloped plot I have seen, and actually beats out Napoleon Dynamite for that trophy. Halfway through I am  begging for the female lead to be killed off, because apart from finding out that she inadvertently kills her husband, she adds absolutely nothing to the story. Just screaming and yelling and making bad decisions. Also, who is Rick? He randomly tries to call her, and this is the first we learn of him, then  he shows up at the house takes her with him, drops of the kid and vanishes again? It's like halfway through writing it the author/director decided he didn't want the kid to be harmed so he threw Rick in there to get the kid out and made him vanish as fast as he appeared, then went back and added the phone call in to the previous part of the story to TRY to make it seem like he was part of the story whole time? Nah, fit in perfectly. I can't even continue to explain this because it is just frustrating that I watched the whole thing expecting something ground breaking to happen and it didn't

Yes, perhaps a bit slow at times (my impression on my first viewing), but the second run through was eye opening. My wife and I, both in the medical field for over 20 years each, have often wondered what we would do if faced with a real-life disaster scenario, not unlike what is depicted here. ""Right At Your Door"" was certainly low-budget, but not low on great acting and high tension. It was done very well, very edge-of-your-seat. It thrived without the special effects so prominent in many movies we see. It succeeded without all the explosions and special effects. Your mind, trapped inside that house, will give you the effects needed to work.",1391472000,,799,4.555555555555555
3029622,2,B000YIGNCW,"Right at Your Door (Chris Gorak, 2006)

I've had Right at Your Door sitting in my Amazon movie wishlist for I don't know how longprobably since it first came out. Once I resubscribed to Netflix, I moved it straight into the DVD queue, and when it showed up for Instant Streaming, I moved it over and watched it within a couple of days (given the size my my Instant queueoh, excuse me, My Listthat happens approximately once in a blue moon). I wish, given all that, I could say it's a better movie than it is. It's not an entirely awful one, but it certainly didn't live up to I've been waiting seven years to see this.

I will tell you right off in the synopsis that if you're watching this one at Netflix Instant, this is another one of those movies where if I had implemented it, the Netflix Synopsis Accuracy meter would be sitting right there at zero. The Netflix Synopsis had me believing that Brad (Argo's Rory Cochrane), our hero, is sitting in his house just outside the radius of the dirty bomb attacks that hit Los Angeles at the beginning of the movie, becoming increasingly crazier and more paranoid, to the point where he's gibbering and drooling in the corner, eating his wife Lexi (K-PAX's Mary McCormick) after cooking her thigh over a bonfire or something. I'm sure there's a way that could be farther than what actually happens, but I can't offhand think of it. Instead, Lexi goes off to work, the dirty bombs hit, Brad's at home camping out with the neighbor's gardener, Alvaro (Scarface's Tony Perez), and trying to reach Lexi via cellphone, which is of course impossible after a terrorist attack. There's also a neighborhood kid, Timmy (Scotty Noyd Jr., who had the misfortune to be in Dark House), who's afraid to go home because...well, that gets into the second half of the movie, at which point we are heading deep into spoiler territory. There are also government agents. Talking about them is not getting into spoiler territory, because if you've seen any two movies about terrorist attacks that contain government agents, you know which side they're on.

The setup is good, if a little understated; I figured Gorak was just taking his time getting the tension ramped up. And then it never got started...and never got started...and never got started. Drama, not thriller. But a little tension works well in a drama, and besides that, it's obvious from the pacing and the sequence of events that this is meant to be a thriller, so in the end, it simply misses the mark. Still, you can see glimpses of what could have been, and if that works for you, give this one a shot. **",1391212800,,2600,4.611231101511879
3029623,4,B000YIGNCW,"This was a good little end of the world indie movie. It really didn't seem like it took much budget and really relied on the actors to carry the ideas across. When I first watched this, I was pleasantly surprised at the unexpected plot twist at the end. That's what really made me want to watch it again to share it with my significant other. He felt the same way that the film was okay until the unexpected ending. I found that it's not a movie you can watch multiple times though. On my second watch of it, I was quite bored but was more interested in the reaction it would receive from the other person I was watching it with (their first time). Whilst I've watched movies multiple times without boredom, this one is more of a one time watch. The female playing the wife could have been a lot stronger portraying more depth in emotion- I felt she was reaching quite a bit and made it uncomfortable to watch her. The male playing the husband I felt was pretty strong in his emotional depth and really carried the entire story.",1390608000,,1028,4.359375

The government would be on vacation or debating the evils of welfare and figuring out how to send more money to rich evil dictators and thugs and start a new liberation somewhere and would not have much time for this distraction, it would be called an incident. The terrorists would be sent home to Saudi Arabia or somesuch and our government would start saying they were just misguided Folks and it was all a cultural misunderstanding. The innocent citizens would have the book thrown at them by prosecutors seeking to be judges. A rumor would start that it was all the fault of some little guy who made a cheapo video. Citizens would be lectured that it is a form of bigotry to be angry at any Muslim and that we should seek all understanding and care and compassion for the nations who do not have Democracy as we do. A tv debate would begin about the meaning of Democracy, If people started to get sick we would be told that it had nothing to do with politics, germs cannot have a political opinion. More money would be sent to dictators and we would be told that we are better people because we care so much. The super little l liberals would have shows blaming it all on American people and our history of slavery. The little c conservatives would say it was Their gods wrath because some Americans are homosexual. If the inner city poor white and black people started dying, we would be told it was because they had not gotten their yearly flu shot and that it could have been something else anyway. We would be told that it would be years before we could begin to know what really happened and not to jump to conclusions. The Californian Hispanic Mexicans would all move to Arizona and there would be Arizona social rallies and arguments and etc. The strong and powerful and democratic silent majority of Muslims would stay silent and out of sight because of fear of American intolerance.

But by the time Lexi arrives back at the house I found myself bored and screaming at the TV for all the stupid things that was happening. For example, the news is reporting that there was a series of dirty bombs (defined as radioactive contamination) around LA but as soon Lexi gets home she is forced to sleep outside the first night. Why didn't Brad immediately seal off a room for her to sleep in to limit her exposure from the radioactive contamination like he does later on in the movie? Why is Lexi constantly walking around outside amongst all the radioactive ash? Why does she try to break through door and then not 5 seconds after she has exposed Brad to the ash she tells him ""I'm glad you're safe inside."" Oh that's right, it's because of the ""plot twist"" at the end where the ""dirty bombs"" suddenly change to biological bombs and somehow because Brad sealed the house with plastic he has made the conditions inside his home worse.... oooookaaay then...",1345939200,,1094,4.53030303030303

I had never heard of this movie before I saw it listed on Amazon.  I bought it because of the subject matter and the high customer ratings.  I'm glad I did.

It is very seldom that a movie ends with a genuine surprise.  One such movie would be ""Sixth Sense"".

THIS is another one.  The ending packs the same sort of wollop that the some of the original ""Twilight Zone"" episodes did in their premier airings.

By all means, settle down with friends and loved ones to watch this little gem.  But, if you already know the ending, DON'T TELL ANYONE.

One little irritant (maybe only to me) was that the DVD producers chose to frame the picture at top and bottom with GREY BARS instead of the usual black. They are always present, but whenever the screen fades to black or the picture gets very dark during night scenes, they stand out unnecessarily.  For me, it was almost as bad as if they chose to make the bars red.  I hope this doesn't become a trend with other DVD's.",1342828800,,993,4.308108108108108

I thought the end would be Cochrane breaking the seal to hold his dying wife, choosing to die himself. Or maybe the last shot would be Cochrane on his side of the seal, alone. Nope, the movie turned it around. Cochrane was contaminated and sealed in by the military and gassed. Pretty amazing movie.",1321833600,,573,4.466666666666667
3029668,4,B000YIGNCW,"A rather well done film.

Not much character development, but the film gets off to a dramatic start quite quickly. Overall, a dark, emotional film that had me asking myself, ""What would I do.""

With my background in Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) training, the husband did just about all the correct protective measures a civilian can take - including preventing his wife from entering the house. Some minor mistakes regarding the military uniforms/equipment and the mobilization of Reserves vs. National Guard, but nothing too horrible.

Like other reviewers, I suspected a ""history"" between Jason and the wife Lexi, but that plot thread isn't followed up on with definition. Perhaps leaving the viewer to assume a history and admire the husband (Brad) for accepting and forgiving his wife's history with Jason. An affair or a former boyfriend - it's an unanswered question.

Several reviewers of this film have stated anger at the husband for not letting the wife inside. That's the plot writer's idea - to strike at the emotions of the viewer. As can be read by the posts, the writer clearly succeeded. Other reviewers comment that they would have forced their way inside the house to the husband. Hmmmm....let's think about this, I'm contaminated, gee....I think I'll force my way inside the house and cause the death of my spouse by exposing him to contamination as well. Ah, now that's true love! Let's hope for the spouses of those reviewers, that they are never exposed to such a situation as portrayed in this film.",1306195200,,1529,4.984313725490196

With only a radio to provide news information, the tension grows as the husband struggles to find and help his wife, who'd been headed to an area where on the explosions took place.

After a series of 'dirty bombs' encase Los Angeles in a poisonous cloud, a husband and his infected wife must struggle to survive on opposite sides of the plastic sheets sealing their home. Mixed reports delivered in a Wellesian fashion filter in through the radio and television broadcasts, while the couple must hide to avoid capture from suspicious military officials. The film strikes an emotional chord in the wake of 9/11, tapping in to real life terrors that hit close to home. Director Chris Gorak implements a hyper-kinetic filming and editing style that intensifies the frantic pace and panic in the streets, while the tiny windows into the outside world delivered through the media create a huge scope on a small scale. Just when the script seems like it has no where to go due to its cramped shooting location, jarring suspense sequences and sharp twists maintain a steady forward momentum. The limited cast members deliver powerful and effective performances that also serve to drive an emotional high from start to finish. Lock your doors, seal your windows, then pop in RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR for a smart and frightening disaster flick.

3029685,4,B000YIGNCW,"This is a powerful indy thriller that demonstrates what can be achieved with a small budget as long as you have a good idea, a good script, and a good cast. The cinematography is impressive, as is the first time direction from Gorak. The performances are convincing, adding weight to this disturbing examination of the effects of terrorist activities on Mr and Mrs Everyman. Their struggle to survive makes for harrowing viewing, and, although it does run out of steam in the middle, it provides a memorable experience. It's a shame that a little humour wasn't injected, particularly during the slightly flat mid-section, and the ending, on reflection, seems just a tad contrived. But overall this is a muscular and unsettling piece of worthwhile cinema.",1266105600,,754,5.04
3029686,2,B000YIGNCW,"This movie frankly irritated me. The pivotal moment is where husband who has been distraught at the possibility of wife being lost in the anthrax cloud rejoices at seeing her return, but is too spineless to allow her back into THEIR house (probably paid for mostly by her) lest she contaminate him. From that instant, even if they were both to survive, that marriage is toast. This aspect is hardly even alluded to in the film itself - now, OK, wife reckons she is doomed anyway so perhaps it's not her numero uno concern at that moment ... but over a timescale of a couple of days, might it not cross her mind? .... hey, come on!

It's a low-budget, independent type of film, but I was quite riveted by it nonetheless. Well, mostly. While I was dutifully chilled to the bone by the images, predicaments and consequences presented in the film, there were some things that didn't quite jell for me.

3029689,5,B000YIGNCW,"""WOW"" was the word I kept silently mouthing as I watched this film.  Cinematography, flawless acting, and an endlessly foreboding tone and script come together for the most engrossing cinematic experience I've had in some time.  Slight spoilers follow, but they all follow under this umbrella: ""This is a small interpersonal story taking place within your typical disaster movie.""

The strength of the script is two-fold: First, it employs a gritty realism via the only source of information the main characters have on hand: the radio news station.  The story of the disaster that has befallen the outer world unfolds through this mechanism, the application of which should trigger memories of 9/11 for all but the most obtuse.  The comparison, however, is never explicitly made, and the implied connection between the American disaster and the events in this film is applied with finesse and grace.

Second, the script and direction trust the intelligence of the viewer.  In particular, subtle use of the radio provides small doorways into the current psychological states of the characters.  Hence, the film isn't nearly as interesting or engaging if the viewer does not surrender their full attention.  For the right viewer, however, that won't be the slightest problem.  Additionally, there are any number of nuances to the relationships between the main characters; catching them all requires even more attentiveness.  The director isn't hiding these things, however.  These extra spices simply contribute to the feeling that the audience is watching real people.  Plot points aren't telegraphed 20 minutes in advance in real life.

This riveting package comes in a small box.  It was filmed on a small budget, but the claustrophobic quarters that provide the setting for the majority of the movie only add to the horror and futility of the situation.  Considering that this is Chris Gorak's first film, I haven't been this excited about a debut since Shane Carruth's Primer (what's HE up to now?).  Hitchcock ain't got nothin' on Chris Gorak!

Highly, HIGHLY Recommended!",1252454400,4,2078,5.2265861027190335
3029690,3,B000YIGNCW,"Lexi (Mary McCormack) gets in her car and drives to work. Brad (Rory Cochrane) seems to want to patch up an argument they had the night before. Terrorists start blowing up dirty, virus carrying bombs all across Los Angeles. In a brief and effective fashion, ""Right At Your Door"" begins.

Problem is, this suspense/drama doesn't have the moxy to stay interesting for its 90-some minute running time. It probably would have made a great 40 minute short or a decent made for TV hour long. Despite the realistic premise and the tightened focus of the film, it never gets a real firm pace. It really wants to be a two-actor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Beach/dp/B00004SGB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Beach</a>. Instead, it's a talky soap opera that often gets ridiculous in the ""suspend your disbelief"" department.

For instance, it is perfectly acceptable that, once Brad hears that bombs are going off in the city, he freaks out and rushes off to find his wife. It's plausible that the cops would start forcibly turning people away and drive Brad back to the house. It's even likely that a panicky neighborhood handyman might rush into your home looking for help. But if your wife came back and begged for help, would you be able to demand she stay out of the house, knowing she would most certainly die? If you were the one locked out and fatal toxins were snowing down around you, would you cave in or start smashing your way in? And if you were doomed to sit near each other while likely dying, would you just sit there and yack yack yack for days?

That's the problem with ""Right At Your Door."" The realistic scenario is undone by the illogical choices made by Lexi and Brad. The film also takes plot turns that are left undeveloped. When Jason (seemingly an ex-boyfriend) suddenly appears outside and tries to convince Lexi to leave Brad and save herself, Brad is more upset in the ""what the hell is he doing here"" manner than the ""Don't leave me"" way. But then the thread just vanishes, along with Jason. Why is he there? What did he mean to Lexi? Then there's the little kid, Timmy. He added some real artistic tension at the beginning by being the human prop that made you look at Los Angeles in flames, but his re-emergence in the film is pointless.

In fact, the visuals in ""Right At Your Door"" are more interesting than anything else. That one look at Los Angeles under attack was more unnerving than anything else in the movie. The falling toxic ash shot was also very effective, as were the ash-coated dead birds. The use of radio broadcasts helped convey the claustrophobic helplessness Brad felt locked inside his house. Had writer/director Chris Gorak stayed more with these kind of cues, maybe cast a pair of more believable actors and tightened the script, ""Right At Your Door"" might have been more like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;and less like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AVP-Alien-Vs-Predator/dp/B00005JMZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AVP - Alien Vs.

3029691,5,B000YIGNCW,"Having seen the positive reviews and the negative reviews for this movie, I had to enter in my own for the first time because I believe that the reason people are reviewing it negatively is because they were A) expecting a horror movie, which this is not, B) don't seem to understand that in a crisis situation such as the one depicted here, yes, people in reality WOULD be screaming at each other, cursing, not thinking straight, panicking and worse, and that it's hardly overdone in this movie, or C) just mad at the characters for not being smarter or more able to anticipate the nature of the mysterious toxic threat since, well, you know, everyone and their mother these days are apparently experts on biological/chemical/radiologic agents.

If you think you can watch this movie without A, B, or C, then I think you're going to enjoy it, and at the very least, it will make you think about some of the hard questions that emergency personnel must ask when they are responding to a large-scale event . . . and the questions we must ask ourselves as possible victims of such an event.

The characters are a realistic couple (reminds me of Rashida Jones's character, Ann, and her boyfriend from Parks and Recreation!), and although you don't get too much character development before the terrorist attack, in my mind they were very believable, very real, and everyday people with realistic responses to the situations presented in the film.  Most of the negative reviews seem to rip on the characters and their reactions to what occurred in the movie as atypical and unbelievable, but I found them to be quite plausible and consistent for people under stress and threat of death, and who were simply trying to survive while being pummeled repeatedly and emotionally by the evolving disaster.

I won't give away the ending, but through it all, you, the viewer, can't help but ask yourself what you would do in the situation.  Presented with an unbearable decision to make, what would you do . . . would you survive at any cost, would you be true to higher moral standards, would you want your loved ones to sacrifice themselves for you, would you trust in your government and neighbors to see you through, would you sacrifice yourself for the good of others?  And what, if any, consequences could you eventually face for your decisions?

The one thing I will agree with as far as the negatives surrounding this film involves the biochemical agent in question.  It is 100% unrealistic for the agent, as described (but I won't give it away), to demonstrate the properties it does in the movie from a purely scientific perspective.  However, if one can suspend their disbelief on this one aspect of the film, and instead commit to the uncertainty of the nature of the biochemical threat as a core part of what moves this film, the rest of it is quite a ride.",1247011200,4,2857,4.709418837675351

3029694,1,B000YIGNCW,"On the list of movies that make me what to pull my brain out through my nose in frustration this one has taken first place.

For as little attention that is paid to it, the premises could have been about a surprise shortage of Gummy Bears. The principal characters of this disaster, (the movie not the subject,) are quite possibly the two stupidest people in the galaxy.

Almost the entire 86 waterboarding minutes are spent watching these two high school drama rejects running around the house in a state confused panic. The male of the two, - played by Rory Cochrane- has Duct Taped himself into his house in oder to avoid ingesting the killer ash that his girlfriend -played by Mary McCormack- on the other side of the plastic has been breathing in like Tony Montana getting geared up for a backyard firefight. Strike number one for this douche. If it's the woman I love; I'm dying with her if I have to, but I'm not leaving her alone on the other side of some Visqueen.

Cochrane divides his time up between running around the house screaming and yelling the same questing or instructions to his girlfriend over and over, and nurturing his complete inability to make even the simplest  decision such as whether to make a phone call or not.

Every time one of them shouts, (a normal tone of voice from these two is about as rare as plutonium 239,) to the other they go out of their way to ignore each other. Neither one seems to have any interest in what the other is trying to tell them no matter how important it might be.

I couldn't understand after his girlfriend left the first time to get to a hospital why she returned. Surly a lung chocking death in a barren urban landscape is better fate. If I was Duct Taped in a house with Cochrane I'd claw my way outside and be jamming toxic ash in my mouth like Rosie O'donnell at an all you can eat Haggen Daz buffet.

Pick up your phone and listen to the dial tone for an hour. You'll be much happier in the end.",1233705600,7,1966,4.36986301369863
3029704,4,B000YIGNCW,"With so many Americans having settled back in to a pre-9/11 mindset, Right At Your Door is a timely and pretty effective wake-up call, really hitting close to home with the ever-present danger of international terrorism.  I have no idea why the working title of this film was once Forearm Shiver, but the final choice of title fits the story perfectly.  Brad (Rory Cochrane) and Lexi (Mary McCormack) are sort of a modern-day Everyman and Everywoman (she works while he practices - or not - with his ""band"") whose normal lives are shattered by a series of explosions across nearby Los Angeles.  As if that weren't bad enough, the drama reaches a sustained crescendo at the couple's very door - literally.  Plenty of films make you wonder what you might do in a certain character's shoes, but Right at Your Door takes it to an extreme, all but demanding that you take a stand on one of the most difficult of questions.

Brad is performing the most mundane of tasks - brushing his teeth - when the local radio station interrupts the music to announce that multiple bombs have exploded all across Los Angeles.  Unable to reach his wife (who works in LA) on the phone, he jumps in the car and heads out into the chaos to find her and bring her home.  Turned back by policemen blocking the city off from incoming traffic, he returns home and soon learns that some sort of dirty bombs were used in the attacks.  As the deadly ash makes it way toward his location, he holds out as long as possible, hoping his wife will suddenly turn up at the door,  before rushing to seal off the house - with the help of a construction worker from next door who has come there seeking refuge - from the deadly fallout.  Then, not long thereafter, the miraculous occurs, and his wife is in fact there at the door, still living and breathing and asking - then demanding - that Brad let her in.

What would you do?  Would you let your soot-covered, contaminated spouse into your house or would you heed the advice of government leaders and deny her entry, hoping that medical help will arrive in time to save her?  Knowing she has been exposed to whatever chemical or biological substance the dirty bombs were packed with, Brad must make an agonizing decision.  Since that decision pretty much sets up the final hour of the film, I will not reveal it here in the context of this review - nor will I even offer a hint as to the nature of the ending (except to say that I think it works rather well).

If you're looking for heart-stopping, blockbuster special effects or visceral horror, Right at Your Door is sure to disappoint you on those counts.  This is very much a character-driven story.  Even if writer/director Chris Gorak had had more than a limited budget to work with, I don't think he would have shot the film any differently, as a bunch of distracting special effects would have interfered with the interpersonal dynamics at the heart of his story.  Brad can see smoke from the nearby explosions, but his only real source of information is the radio (he and Lexi just moved into this house and this was the very day that the cable guy was supposed to come out and get their television set up).  This only adds to the insular feel of the drama playing out before our eyes.  Having said that, though, I do have to admit that the film didn't pull me in as powerfully as I thought it would.  While Brad and Lexi obviously love one another, there's seemingly a lack of chemistry in their relationship.  I felt as if one of the home's many layers of plastic sheeting and duct tape found its way between me and the characters - just enough to prevent me from truly embracing this couple and their awful plight.  Still, Right at Your Door is a memorable and well-made film built around a most fascinating premise - and quite a debut for first-time director Gorak.",1233532800,4,3843,4.505763688760807
3029705,1,B000YIGNCW,"I watched this video expecting to see something similar to what was mentioned in the blurb on the case. In reality, the story was pretty much the opposite. The characters were not sympathetic and the drama was a little overdone.

I would have had a better review had the movie actually been what was on the box. The ending was cheap and contrived. You're expecting some awesome event only to find, naturally, the military is our enemy. Now, is that a new and original twist?

3029706,4,B000YIGNCW,"It's present day Los Angeles, and terrorists have detonated several ""dirty bombs"" in the heart of the city.  The immediate damage is bad enough, but these bombs are carrying a deadly toxin in their ash, and it's starting to blow out to the suburbs.  Many hundreds of thousands of are dead or likely to die.

RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR posits the above scenario...but as a very low budget film, we see the story from the point of view of two suburbanites, Brad (Rory Cochrane) and Lexi (Mary McCormack).  This thirty-something, childless couple are moving into a new house, and in the morning, Lexi heads off to her downtown job with a cellphone that needs charging.  Brad, who might be some sort of musician or something that keeps him at home, goes about his day.

A chilling scene occurs.  We see Brad brushing his teeth, listening to some rock on the radio.  Suddenly, the familiar sound that signals a ""test of the emergency broadcast system"" starts.  How many times have we heard that.  We know exactly how long that tone goes on before the ""this is a test"" starts.  So does Brad, so when the tone goes on longer than usual, we see the tension enter his body...just as it would ours.  We KNOW something that isn't a test is about to happen.

Brad hears that downtown LA has been hit with explosions.  He tried to call Lexi...but remember, her phone is dead.  In the early scenes of the movie, we see him panicking and running for this car to go find his wife.  He sees scenes of growing chaos around him, smoke in the distance and a rapidly increasing police presence.  He even witnesses the police shooting a man who has clearly made it to the suburbs from downtown because his car is covered in ash.

Brad reluctantly goes back home.  He's joined in his house by an elderly Hispanic man who had been doing some work on the house next door.  The man tells Brad they need to seal up the house before the toxic ash comes their way.  Brad, naturally, is reluctant to seal his wife out...but eventually he agrees, and they tape up the house just as the ash begins to drift down.

But then Lexi shows up, obviously already feeling the effects of what she's been exposed to...and Brad cannot let his wife into the house.  From there, emotional, physical and moral challenges occur.  I don't want to tell you any more, because describing the plot is hardly the point anyway.

The TONE of RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR is what grabs us.  At first, we understand the panic & fear than anyone would feel.  Seeing this movie via Brad's point of view not only makes it work within the limited budget...but it makes the scale of the disaster personal and we can empathize.  Later, as news from the scene becomes murky and rumors of what's ""really happening"" at the hospitals and quarantine sites begins to spread...a feeling of dread and paranoia sets in.  The movie isn't quite taking the path of ""the cure is worse than the disease"" or ""we are our own worst enemies"" by showing soldiers who will shoot anyone or Americans killing each other...but it does convincingly show how common sense can collide with fear, and when mixed with sketchy information, can lead to some bad choices.

RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR gets a lot of details right.  This isn't a nuclear explosion after all...so electricity remains mostly on and the radio / TV coverage is constant.  Cell phone service continues unabated, and we get a sense, through calls with family members, of an ""outside world"" that is physically untouched and normal...but also reeling with the enormity of what has happened.

Mary McCormack (who is doing such a nice job on the new TV series ""In Plain Sight"") is convincing as the wife who is at first appalled at being locked out of her own house and then finds reserves of bravery.  If only her eye makeup hadn't been so terribly bad (she's been crying, you see, so much of the makeup is smeared all over her face during much of the movie).  But it is Rory Cochrane, whom I'm sure I've seen before but never taken notice of, who owns the movie.  He's in literally all but two or three scenes...and his ordinary guy demeanor is just right for the film.  He's not a coward...but he is full of fear anyway.  He loves his wife...but also fears his own death if he touches her again.  The dynamics between the two are almost as interesting as figuring out everything that's going on around the disaster.

The film is not perfect.  Although it's only 96 minutes...it feels stretched.  Some scenes in the middle seem to cover the same ground a few times.  I think 10 minutes could have been lost and the film would have had a very crisp pace.  As it is, it drags at times.  And the nighttime scenes are TOO murky.

Writer/director Chris Goran, with a background as an art director, has made a very nice first film.  It has ambitious themes and it knows its limits VERY well.  The budget never feels stretched.  He makes the needed small scale work for him, because it adds to the mood of isolation.

(I hope I've made it very clear that this is a drama about moral choices we make in the face of extreme stress and danger.  It is NOT an action movie or a horror movie or a sci-fi movie...or a political movie.  I've seen a few reviews from viewers who clearly expected such and thus blasted the film.)

RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR also has an unneeded but still effective surprise in store at the end.  It felt a little like a gimmick...but was still chilling.

Overall, I have to recommend this solid, effective outing.  It was a nice surprise.",1221696000,2,5499,4.510121457489879

3029709,1,B000YIGNCW,"As has increasingly become the case, I made the mistake of trusting horror buff movie reviewers at a certain ""bloody"" website once again and ended up renting (thankfully not buying) this arty little throwaway of a flick.
Right at Your Door tells the tale of a young married couple living in Los Angeles whose affections and committment for each other are put to the ultimate test when they become the victims of a terrorist biochemical attack.
The movie begins somewhat servicably enough with a decent score by TomandAndy, as we are introduced to a young couple whose marriage may or may not be a little strained due to the fact that the wife is the primary bread winner. While on her way to work the terrorist dirty bomb attack goes down with husband (Cochrane, an underratted actor in my opinion) trying frantically to reach his wife by any and all means to see if she's alright.
Eventually we learn that the bomb has unleashed unknown chemicals into the air and has sent the city into a panic.
SPOILERS AHEAD: Long story short, the wife makes it back to the house where her husband has already taped up the windows and doors forming a makeshift quarrantine. Various silly attempts at tension and drama ensue and then before you know it, the movie (which seems a lot longer than it is because it's boring) ends on a completely foreseeable note when we learn that the husband has doomed himself, and not his wife, by locking himself in the house and her out. Confused? don't be, the movie sucks.
And I'm not judging it on the basis of it's obviously limited budget, nor the actors, who both do a wonderful job with such an amateurish script and story to work with. I'm judging it on pure entertainment and intellectual value, it's lame, boring and a waste of time.",1210032000,5,1765,4.606349206349206
3029710,2,B000YIGNCW,"There seemed to be hope that ""Right at Your Door"" would be an intense and realistic view into a dirty bomb attack on a major American city. Our main character desperately tries to get to his wife through a torrent of confusion, police officers, and onlookers. Distraught, he returns home. And stays there. The rest of the film is spent in the confines of the house. There is never any real sense of the monumental disaster going on downtown. It is only the fear and panic of a few people, and it is explored only on a superficial level.

In fact, this reminds me of an off Broadway play. You get glimpses of smoke in the background, occasional sirens, peeks out of the window, but there is little here that couldn't be found on stage. The movie attempts to capture the raw emotion of a man, his wife, and a neighbor in crisis and isolated, but the result is downright boring. There is little connection to the plight of the city and its residents, and the disconnect makes this largely uninteresting. Yes, there is a twist at the end, but it doesn't make up for the lack of tension or storyline required to get to it.",1208995200,3,1117,4.422330097087379

3029712,1,B000YIGNCW,"Watch out for the Dirty Bomb!

No, silly, I'm talking about this movie!

Meet crack business warrior Lexi (Mary McCormack bringing home the bacon AND frying it up in a pan AND...uh, FRYING): hard-charging yuppie on a mission. The Early Bird gets the Germ!

Meet schlubby unemployed loser husband Brad (shlubby unemployed loser actor Rory Cochrane): watch as he ponders the breathless pace of his morning---will it be cheese doodles? Dr. Phil? Cheese Doodles *with* Dr. Phil?

WATCH! There really are Two Americas---Lexi in the one that works, Brad in the one that doesn't (but chums off America #1). So tighly-wound yuppie chick on a mission Lexi gets up early and motors it onto the LA freeway, while schlubby husband Brad, unemployed, part of a 'band' (hey, man, he's got guitars to prove it! he's cool! yeah!) schlubbs around the house after trying a little AM whoopee (dead sexy, Brad! hot! rowwwr you Romeo you!) with the wife.

Lexi goes to work. Brad stays home, presumably to chill on the couch, eat cheese doodles, watch Dr. Phil.

GASP! As Terrorists, meanwhile, bored of GTA4 with nothing better to do, do a little urban jihad on old LA with a bunch of combo hit LA with a bunch of combo chemical/biological bombs that turn everyone in hotzone (translation: workers of the world, exfoliate!) into walking geiger counters, Lexi included, and soon LA has more air quality worries than a little smog.

Brad, meanwhile, gets to---uh, stay in the house, eat cheese doodles, and lounge around on the couch. Score one for Brad!

MORAL #1: Being unemployed and lounging around the house watching Dr. Phil and eating cheese doodles is a lot better than sucking down a load of Ebola Zaire-Anthrax-Mustard Gas blister agent! And it's even more useful than stocking up on bottled water and duct tape if you wanna make it through a terrorist dirty bomb attack!

MORAL #2: The Glass Ceiling ain't got a thing on the Anthrax Ceiling!

MORAL #3: Terrorists don't really appreciate the whole ""Earth Day"" thing.

Director Chris Gorak (formerly artistic director for Fight Club, etc., and that full command of grungy authenticity does come through here) really tries to generate a kind of crescendo of mortal terror with ""Right at your Door"", and you've got all the nods to the great apocalyptic flicks: soldiers and fuzz in hotsuits and gas masks grunting out muffled orders, the city sinking mortally wounded into terror, and death, and darkness, and some workably impressive backdrops of a doomed and dying Los Angeles cityscape.

It would work nicely if the movie weren't a complete bore.

It could be a stage show, comprised of three characters: Shlubby Brad, Sexy Lexi, and the next door neighbor's Mexican handyman who Brad inexplicably bonds with, proving there are no atheists in foxholes, but there sure are a lot of weirdos.

Given that the handyman gets bored and wanders off midway through the show (I feel your pain, amigo!), that means ""Right at your Snore"" is an intimate little duel between two characters. That would work if we're talking David Mamet (a la ""Glengarry Glen Ross""), but here we're more at the level of Oprah (a la ""Women who love Men who love Midgets with Big Butts).

Nothing really happens. The three characters take turns looking 1) nervous 2) constipated 3) nervously constipated 4) dialing around on their cell phones & texting 5) drinking bottled water. That's it. Occasionally The Man comes around (in gas mask! In hazmat suit! with machine gun! rat a tat tat!) looking a little confused and pokes a flashlight at Brad.

Here the tension boils down to this: can Brad get his fat butt off the couch long enough to call 911? Don't believe me? Here's a sampling of film dialogue:

BRAD: Honey, I'm so sorry, I hate that you gotta sit out there on the porch and die. Hey where did you put the cheese doodles?

LEXI: I'm glad you're safe honey! I'm glad you stayed home and watched dr. phil! Does this portable gas mask make my butt look fat?

The biggest problem with ""Right"" is I didn't believe a minute of it.

Bottom line: take a good hard look at Lexi. Then check out Brad. Go ahead. I'll wait. Back? OK: you and I both know if Brad did what he did to Lexi at about 30 minutes in, it would have taken her about 2 seconds to do a SWAT roll through the kitchen door and sent Brad (courtesy of the Flying Roundhouse Chop) for a little quality time with the formica floor. Terminated! With Extreme Prejudice!

Check out that little crinkly delta of pure red rage wrinkles that crop up around the time she realizes her unemployed loser husband is keeping her out of her own home: yeah, baby, it's CLOBBERIN' TIME! If Lexi had drop-kicked Brad across the dinette set at that moment, this flick would have gotten 5 stars. Mary McCormack actually is a real champ with her preposterous role (in any decent flick she would have been wearing Brad's ears for a war necklace about 5 minutes after his ""you keep a knockin but you can't come in"" moment.

I mean, jeez: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus, sure, but when Venus gets a little gas that's grounds for making her park it on the back porch forever?

3029713,2,B000YIGNCW,"""Right At Your Door"" was a huge disappointment from the start until about four minutes before the credits. It reminds me of ""Monster"" (no, not the one with Charlize Theron, the other one. The stupid one). It starts out auspiciously enough, with the ""bombing"" of L.A., then degenerates quite quickly from there. Rory Cochrane is unconvincing as Brad, the Husband. Mary Mc Cormack, as Lexi, the Wife, is just as bad.

Things move rather quickly during the bombing, but come to a screeching halt once Brad makes it back home. When Lexi finally decides she's had enough of running around like a chicken with it's head cut off, and makes it back home, as well, it's just yap, yap, yap at the back door, for much too long. I caught a little snooze time, as the next thing I saw, was Lexi being dragged off by someone in a bio suit, saying that she was the lucky one! Brad is convieniently ""put out of his misery"" with a gas that is piped into the house, to kill the virus/fungus/bugaboo, because it has incubated IN the house all that time! WOW!

3029714,2,B000YIGNCW,"This is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, it is not very deep, it lacks emotion, good acting, and a plausible plot, but oh how ironic this film ends up being. You want irony? You got irony, and little else.

The film takes place in LA after a series of ""dirty bombs"" have gone off in downtown turning the streets of Americas 2nd largest city into a battlefield overnight. Husband and wife Brad and Lexi wake up one typical sunny day and go about their lives as usual. Lexi dries downtown to work while Brad stays home. Suddenly Brad feels the ground shake, hears a distant boom, and then messages start to come over the radio about a terrorist attack in the downtown area. After a useless attempt to find his wife, Brad seals himself off in his home and tries to make sense of the situation unfolding around him though scattered and confused radio reports.

The film is basically yet another play on our post 9/11 fears. This kind of movie has been done so many times since the towers fell that it's no longer original, depressing, and, more importantly, it's no longer scary. How many times are independent film makers, lacking in budget and talent, going to keep making this same movie over and over and over again? When will it stop? It is good to remember that day, but it isn't necessary to bombard us with these constant speeches and ""artsy"" films. Right at your Door is just another independent film trying to do its best with a low budget by pulling on our emotional strings and relying far too much on the events of 9/11 for its main themes. Not to say that's a bad thing, obviously films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>, which came out earlier this year, managed to do just that in a very convincing way, but there are dozens of poorly made low budget independent films that all try to do basically the same thing. This film is nothing special.

The acting is okay overall, with Mary McCormack giving a superb performance as Lexi, while Rory Cochrane's portrayal of Brad was bland and unconvincing. The real meat of this film comes from what little we see of the devastation of LA. Although we see relatively little- the whole film takes place in their home and rarely moves outside of it- what we are shown of the disaster is stunning in its realism. The poison ashes raining from the sky like snow, a little boy staring at the smoke rising in the distance, its all very haunting and is far and away the best thing this film does. Unfortunately the suspense and dread built up in this film dies away as the film goes on. SPOILER!!!! Why is it, after about three days of being exposed to the poisons, does Lexi not feel any of its effects other then a cough when the news says people are dieing in the streets? END OF SPOILER!!! Why does Brad's car still drive after getting a flat tire? It doesn't make much sense.

This movie has some seriously twisted irony at the end, but it really isn't that hard to see coming, and it's hard to care when it does come because the characters aren't really the kind of people you'd care about.

As toxic residue blankets the area, Brad finds himself in a classic lifeboat situation.  Whom to save and whom to jettison?  Where do you draw the line between helping others and putting yourself in jeopardy.  An end of film twist raises questions of who is the rescuer and who is the rescued.

A disturbing film and a vision one hopes remains confined to cinema.  Other eras had Godzilla and other monsters spawned from atomic fallout.

It's a pretty strong independent film. I thought the use of music was good. What I like the most is how they reflect that feeling when something real bad happens, it feels almost unreal.
Also the alternation of faster-paced scenes and quiet ones is done quite nicely.
I like the special features as well. Lotta interview footage with Gorak. The only thing though is that his voice is rather calm- keeps making me feel sleepy.",1205625600,4,692,4.634146341463414
3029718,3,B000YIGNCW,"For some reasone I kept expecting to see Jack Bauer make an appearance..heh.

I remember seeing the trailers for this movie quite awhile back, and it looked very interesting. So when I saw it sitting in the DVD isle, I snagged it right away, even though I started to expect bad things since it I figured it was going to be in theaters, but apparently not.

I don't remember names so we'll go with Husband and Wife. They both just moved to LA and are still unpacking into their new house. Wife has to go to work and Husband stays home to keep unpacking. A terrorist attack occurs in the city while Wife is in the city. Husband doesnt know what to do. You can tell he's definitely in love with his wife because even though the news is saying to stay at home and that a dirty bomb has exploded downtown, he still takes off to find her. Without accomplishing what he set out to do he returns home to wait for his wife. When she eventually shows up (this was all in the previews so I'm not trying to ruin anything) is when basically the emotional and mind-bothering scenes begin to happen. I try to picture myself in a situation like this and sometimes I cant figure out what I would do. Do I risk letting her in? Would I want to live without her even if she IS infected? Even if I wanted to die with her...would I be to scared to go out the way she does since the virus could be excruciatingly painful? This part of the movie really does get to you.

But sometimes I wonder if they even think that. Sure they love each other...but sometimes you just wonder. When you see some of the actions they both do in the movie (mainly her), you have to wonder..WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? I'll tell you my biggest problem with Wife that won't ruin the movie. During the movie, you see cops and the military on the public streets doing sweeps of neighborhoods trying to locate individuals caught outside. Well Husband wants Wife to stay in the backyard and he even sealed off the house from the bedroom that has a sliding door to the outside so she could have a bed and fresh water and food he placed in there before he sealed off. Well she's on her cell phone talking and talking and just walking around...not staying in the house...and then walking to the side of the house where she can be seen. I'm thinking to myself ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" Parts like that really aggravated me about this movie and it happens a lot.

Another reason why I just think this is a SO-SO movie is how boring it could be at times. I thought it was much to drawn out, and parts in the movie just didn't need to be there. Also me and my friend both pretty much guessed the whole movie (almost) down to the ending. Though through our thought process we came up with a MUCH better movie than we were watching..heh.

Sadly, I wish I could rate the movie higher, but I just thought it was to boring. Thought provoking..yes...but just to boring. I DO think the director has promise though.",1203897600,2,2942,4.303249097472924

3029721,5,B000YIGNCW,"I don't know what happened to ""Right at Your Door."" I don't know why it wasn't given a larger theatrical release and why the DVD has hit video stores without any support. Could be that it hit too close to too many people's post-9/11 terrors and, as a result, was just too damned scary.

This incredibly tense apocalyptic thriller follows what happens to a happy, middle-class couple when a series of dirty bombs explode in Los Angeles. Rory Cochrane plays Brad, a musician/slacker who's recently moved into a new home with his wife, Lexi (Mary McCormack). When the film opens he's staying home to finish unpacking boxes and she's driving downtown to go to work.

Then all hell breaks loose.

Working within an indie budget, writer/director Goran keeps the focus of his story tight and uses creativity to suggest the large-scale disaster he can't show. As someone once said, it's the horror you can't see that's most frightening because your imagination is always worse than the real thing, and the film takes advantage of this at every turn.

Goran creates an in-the-news tension and terrific mood by describing the bombs' destruction and chaos in a series of radio broadcasts that continue almost uninterrupted through the entire film. Brad first notices something is wrong when his morning news is interrupted by the urgent tone of the Emergency Broadcast System.

The phones are jammed and Brad can't contact Lexi, so he jumps into his car intending to drive downtown and get Lexi at work. He tears through the streets of his neighborhood as the radio announces additional explosions and greater destruction. When his rescue mission ends in police blockades just a few blocks away and the shooting of a man from downtown who's probably ""infected,"" Brad returns home.

Turns out the bombs are dirty, packed with radiation, chemicals and/or biologic agents. (The film never makes the exact mix clear -- another smart choice, because it mirrors the confusion that would actually follow such an event and makes the terror that much more effective. It also helps set up the film's dark ending.)

The radio warns listeners to seal up their homes and avoid contact with anyone who may come to them for aid. Brad and a handyman from next door wait for Lexi and watch as the fallout heads their way. When they can't wait any longer, they reluctantly seal up the house with duct tape and plastic tarps, but not before Brad puts a few supplies outside in case Lexi does make it home.

Which, of course, she does, frantic and covered in ash, grateful to finally be home, terrified and enraged when she realizes that Brad has shut her out and can't open the door. Even though the story lags a bit at this point -- the first 30 minutes' screaming panic just can't be sustained indefinitely -- it soon builds up steam and interest as Brad and Lexi struggle with the reality of their situation, negotiating their stand-off and figuring out a way to survive until help arrives.

Not everything disaster-related happens off-screen. Goran gives us some eerie shots of the Los Angeles skyline shrouded in gray clouds and a lovely but upsetting scene when toxic ash falls onto Brad and Lexi's backyard like snow.

Like ""Cloverfield,"" ""Right at Your Door"" makes a virtue of its limited perspective. But unlike this winter's big horror hit, there's not a lot of metaphor at work here. Goran admits in the DVD's bonus materials he was inspired by 9/11. Maybe it's because his monster is all-too plausible that executives got cold feet when it came time to market and release the film, even though it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and won for its cinematography. (This last one I don't get -- if I have one criticism it's with the film's sometimes muddy look.) For whatever reason, ""Right at Your Door"" limited U.S. theatrical release came and went with nary a word in August of 2007, virtually guaranteeing viewers would miss it. But don't be one of them. ""Right at Your Door"" is one of the scariest films I've seen in a long time.",1203292800,,4031,4.778735632183908
3029722,1,B000YIGNCW,"We don't care about these characters because the development is zero. When you finally do reach the ""twist"" you are so bored that you couldn't care less what happens to this couple. The film attempts to create these loving, sympathizing characters during extreme circumstances but fails miserably. Perhaps it is the use of over-the-top foul language that prevents the viewer from really wanting to feel for these people. I'm no prude and actually see how harsh language is sometimes realistic and adds to the drama but hearing people screaming, ""f*#k this"" and ""fu*king that"" 5-6 times in one minute is just ridiculous. Bring some knitting or your checkbook to balance because there is plenty of time for it. When the twist (FINALLY) comes I guess we're supposed to get all, ""Woe! That is so freaky!"" but I was left hearing Peggy Lee singing, ""Is that All There Is?""",1203206400,7,866,4.858108108108108
3029723,2,B000YIGNCW,"In the wake of the success of such films as ""28 Days (+Weeks) Later"", the ""Resident Evil"" trilogy, ""I Am Legend"", ""Cloverfield"" and a trillion others - some good, some terrible - to come out and make another apocalyptic drama, where the threat is massive and unstoppable, seems to be a risky move, especially with literally no budget to supplement it. The novelty of those films' relevance tends to quickly wear off, baring the so-called meat'n'bones that shape the film. Apart from the numerous nods to the current political chaos, the question is whether a film can stand on its own, with a strong plot to supplement the dreary poignancy of post-9/11 imagery.
""Right at Your Door"" cannot. It tries hard, mind you, or rather insistently attempts to keep the tension level sky high using only dialogue between two people, trapped in a situation that first comes off as truly terrible and heart-wrenching, but gradually becomes more and more unbelievable as the film progresses.
It seems like just another typical L.A. day, when struggling musician Brad (the reliable Rory Cochrane) wakes up next to the sexy wealthy Lexi (Mary McCormack) (oooh, can you see the conflict building here?). She's off to work; and then the film plunges right into its premise. Brad hears shocking reports on the radio about 'dirty bombs' going off in downtown L.A. His first priority is to get Lexi. The city emanating ominous black fumes in the background (hauntingly evoking 9/11), Brad races through the hilly neighborhood, fruitlessly trying to get through the panicking police. At this point, the audience is hooked: the tension is palpable, the situation all-too-real. Those early scenes are directed and edited so well, it's doubly disappointing to realize that the film stops short once Brad returns home (about 15 mins into the film) to find a frightened man who's rushed in from the chaotic streets, and together they begin to seal up the house. At this point it's clear Brad ain't getting out, and the action is going to be limited to indoors. When Lexi comes back through the rain of ash (an effective shot; one of the very few), coughing and spitting blood, Brad refuses to let her in, and the film hangs on their dialogue, spoken through a shield of firmly-taped plastic.
Richard Linklater did it in ""Tape"" and ""Before Sunset"", but Chris Gorak (art-director on films like ""Fight Club"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") is no Linklater - here the conversation between husband and wife fails at sustaining interest. It's 'been there, seen that' territory. You can predict the characters' actions (not that they do all that much to begin with). There are a few scenes that approach a mild level of suspense, most of them involving angry, unresponsive dudes in masks questioning Brad through the sealed doors. And if the outcome does come a bit unexpectedly, to call it satisfying would be a long stretch. It actually makes less and less sense the more you think about it.
So while ""Right at Your Door"" starts off on a high note, it literally disintegrates into low-budget drivel - cruel, shriek-y, depressing pseudo-artsy fair. It says nothing new about terrorism, or its effects, and what it does say is bleak and monotonous. A better director, say, Danny Boyle, may have turned this film into an edge-of-your-seat apocalyptic drama. As it is, ""Right at Your Door"", like its dying female protagonist, should remain locked behind it.",1202860800,4,3427,4.930795847750865

The characters are almost totally unsympathetic, mismatched in their marriage, and irrational in their behavior.  The ""science"" involved in the explanations of the ""dirty"" bombs is garbage.  First, it's just unexplained, then it's toxins from the burning buildings, then it's a virus.  It not only defies the common understanding of a ""dirty"" bomb, which involves radioactive materials, but changes itself in order to lead to a contrived ending.  Moreover, the core plot supposes that one or more individuals can live in a totally duct-tape sealed building for more than a few hours, which was proven wrong in tragic deaths in New York following 9-11, so it gives bad suggestions for surviving a dirty bomb.  There are no elements of a good story either; no lessons learned, no catharctic moments, no character growth or development, and no satisfaction either in the process nor the resolution.

Right at Your Door is intellectually dishonest and emotionally cheap.  It presents characters who might work in a pure allegory, but not in a movie that tries to suggest that their reactions are any approximation of what real people might do in a premise involving a biological attack.

Director Chris Gorak, who has received so much praise for his efforts here, doesn't seem to have a coherent moral vision, or even an opinion.  He's more like Eli Roth, a bit of a sloppy misanthrope, a man who believes that our least desirable impulses are important enough to propel a narrative.

During the 45 minutes I could stand of this rubbish, so many visceral reactions emerged.  How can anyone be so stupid and needy that their base instinct is to drive into deep danger to save a girlfriend?  Think about it.  Rational human beings won't just swallow the garbage sensational radio voices spew at them -- unless they are as stupid and cliched as the sheeple Gorak seems to think we are.  This is where the dishonesty and cheapness of the film really rear their head -- only an incredibly stupid person would race toward a bombed zone to save one person -- I don't care how many romantic fairy sprinkles you throw at the situation.

If someone inside your house, during a municipal crisis, told you that you couldn't come into your own home, would you not, as a right-bearing, survival-keen property owner (or even renter) do everything in your power to bust into your own home?  Nobody will ever keep me out of my house without a fight, but Gorak expects us to sit through endless doorway conversations while a weak male character (who can cry on cue) and a weak female character (who should shatter every window in that house to get in) make decisions based on either 1) no information or 2) fuzzy, empty radio information.

The characters lack roundness.  Gorak is not interested in their extended lives other than to offend us with a rude, irrational, and completely implausible moment when the male character hangs up (!) on his missing girlfriend's mother, a woman who only wants the comfort of knowing what's going on.  This male character spends endless airwaves and battery cycles calling and calling his girlfriend, as if she is the only person in the world.  Sorry, filmmakers, but most of us have other important people in our lives, people we'd want to call: moms, dads, siblings, the list goes on.

The real reason I could not finish this movie is that it assumes we have no ingenuity whatsoever and are now completely (d)evolved sycophants in the Bush era.  We wait for what the radio tells us.  We don't know anything about biological warfare.  We duct-tape our windows even though that advice is unsound.  We can't put together a simple plan.

The movie and its makers think we just fell off a Christmas tree.",1201651200,5,3020,4.7034220532319395
3264048,5,B000YIGNCW,"We lived in Florida during the Cuban missle crisis and instead of ducking and covering under our desks we went out in the hallway and huddled against the wall during our nuclear attack drills.  When I was growing up it was pretty much taken for granted that one day the Cold War was going to go nuclear.  There were movies from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Beach/dp/B00004SGB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Beach</a>"" to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fail-safe/dp/B00004XPPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fail-safe</a>"" that played out possible scenarios for the end of the world as we knew it, and even ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B0002JJBZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>"" assumed that World War III was going to be a nuclear war.  When ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After/dp/B0001WTVUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After</a>"" came out Carl Sagan was on the special edition of ""Nightline"" that followed saying that a real nuclear winter would be much worse than what we say in that made for television movie.  But now we live in a world where a full out nuclear exchange between two super powers seems extremely remote if not impossible and we would like to believe that a terrorist attack involving nuclear weapons is not inevitable.  We have seen such a scenario played out with super Agent Jack Bauer on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B00008YGRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>,"" but that never really involves ordinary people.  That is not the case with ""Right at Your Door,"" which plays out against our worst fears at a very basic level.

Brad (Rory Cochrane) and Lexi (Mary McCormack) are living together in Los Angeles and on this fateful morning she goes off to work.  The next thing Brad nows there are reports on the radio of a series of blasts in the city.  It turns out that not only is this a terrorist attack, but that the bombs were dirty bombs that are filling the air with toxic clouds of deadly ash.  Of course Brad tries to contact Lexi, but the phone lines are jammed and when he jumps in his car to try and go and find her, his efforts are thwarted by the police.  Chances are she is already dead, but Brad simply does not know one way or the other.  So he returns home and seals up his doors and windows against the toxic cloud that is coming, and waits for Lexi to call or get back home.

This turns out to be only the grim opening act of first-time writer-director Chris Gorak's film, which was screened at Sundance in 2006 and only grossed $64K when it was released for a few weeks last year.  Now that it is out on DVD, word of mouth should help ""Right at Your Door"" get a much larger audience, because this is an engrossing little film.  One aspect of the film's low budget is that instead of television coverage of what is going on, all we and the characters get are radio broadcasts.  However, this ends up working in the film's favor as our imagination fills in the grim details, as do the simply sights of black clouds of smoke and the rain of ash particles.  More money would not have improved the finished product and most of the story plays out in and around the home that Brad and Lexi share.  There is also an echo of 9/11 in how family and friends reach out by cell phone.

The film that ""Right at Your Door"" reminds me most of in terms of these apocalyptic films ends up being ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Testament/dp/B00062IDJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Testament</a>,"" the harrowing story of a family trying to survive in the aftermath of a nuclear war far enough away from the destruction, but not far enough away from the fallout.  ""Testament"" has a much longer time-frame than ""Right at Your Door,"" but it shares the same intimate focus.  Overall I liked the way things played out in the end (I certainly was not expecting that particular resolution), although the set up for the end game did strike me as a bit strange when it was happening.  That was the one bit that immediately struck me as unbelievable that under those circumstances the cell phone (this reference will make sense when you see the film) would be an issue worth pursuing.  I was going to round down on the film because of that flaw, but you know me.  I think irony is the master trope of the universe and when you surprise me with an ironic twist at the end of the story I end up rounding up.

The DVD extras include the scripts for a pair of alternative endings for the film, and it is heartening to think that at least Gorak did not film either one of them, because I am getting tired of filmmakers getting to the ending of their flms and picking options (just take any of the classic films of your choice, imagine alternative endings, and shudder accordingly).  This is an effective little film, and while I would not call it great, it certainly deserves to be seen by more people than have caught it to date.  That is why I have talked in general terms about the opening act and left the other two-thirds of the movie for you to discover for yourself.",1201651200,34,5275,5.089327146171693
3264049,5,B000YIGNCW,"Although produced on an independent budget, the filmmakers here have created a fantastic thriller.  Set in Los Angeles, the film starts out as every day in our lives does, until that is, an unknown terrorist organization sets off a series of dirty bombs in the downtown area.  Recalling the panic that set in on 9/11, our main characters don't know what to do, who to trust, or where to find credible information.  What ensues is a truly scary proposition of what might happen, police declare marshall law, hospitals become traps for unwilling victims, and general chaos follows.  The performance of Rory Cochrane is really what drives this tale, as he might finally get the recognition he deserves as a dramatic actor, after appearing in such films as Dazed & Confused, and A Scanner Darkly for the past 10 years, as well as CSI: Miami.  The supporting cast is excellent as well, although it only takes a few poeple to drive this story, an element of its genius.  I won't give away the ending, but it is definitely a twist you don't see coming.  Some might not want to see a movie about what might possibly happen in the future, but I think that would be missing the point.

3264090,4,B000YIGNCW,"Other reviewers have covered the plot, the Indie script and the acting quality and direction.

As a premise, this is an all too plausible scenario--a dirty bomb, and unprepared civilians caught unawares and scrambling to cope.

The unemployed musician beta-male obediently tapes up the house with duct tape as the Government voices on the radio instruct him to do. Obediently he refuses to allow his (obviously contaminated) wife into the sealed house, as the Government told him to do.
And ultimately he is killed by officials of that same Government. You could make a libertarian argument out of this film, along with a decline of American manhood argument, and the script suggests both.

Ultimately it's a very bleak film with a fatal ending. Much of the dialog is pretty mundane and forgettable. None of the characters are remotely likable, even though their predicament is tragic and it's obvious that one or both are doomed.

None of the loose plot threads--who did this, why, what else is happening in the larger world outside-- are ever explained or resolved. That's not artsy or enigmatic, it's just sloppy scripting. And it makes this a just-OK film, but not the powerful cult classic it could have become with a better, smarter script and tighter, less self-indulgently directionless editing.

Four Stars for the concept, and the effective atmosphere (pardon the pun) of doomed claustrophobia and powerlessness.

I wouldn't care to own it. But for free streaming, it has some moments amid the bleakness. Obviously, this is not a first-date movie.

Hope this review was helpful. Enjoy!",1407369600,,1595,5.088122605363985
3264091,3,B000YIGNCW,"In Right At Your Door (2006), the population of southern California unexpectedly faces an unknown biological threat, and one man finds himself sealed inside his home, waiting for answers.  Some minor spoilers follow.

Brad (Rory Cochrane,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oculus/dp/B00KNVF3US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oculus</a>) is at home when he learns that dirty bombs have been dropped in LA.  He heads out to search for his wife Lexi (Mary McCormack,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Plain-Sight/dp/B001QUXNQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Plain Sight</a>) but is turned back by the police.  Returning home, Brad finds a laborer named Alvaro (Tony Perez) in his home, and together they apply duct tape over the openings in the walls, and tape plastic sheeting over the windows, sealing themselves inside.

Lexi does return home, but has been exposed, and is forced to remain outside.  Most of the action is confined to the house, but matters proceed rather slowly, until the army appears on the scene.  Although a terrible fate is anticipated, what happens will probably take most by surprise.

Written and directed by Chris Gorak, Right At Your Door features some good performances, as the story follows a pretty credible path, in regards to how a catastrophic event like this might unfold.  That said, realistic doesn't always make for the most engrossing watch.  Nothing really amazing happens, and the downbeat ending won't be to everyone's liking, but for those interested in ""outbreak"" tales, this film is certainly worth a look while it is available on Prime.

3264106,1,B000YIGNCW,"I added this to my watch list because there was a few 4-5 star reviews on it.

Warning: Spoiler alerts below.

This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Let start with random fade to black, meaningless scene transitions? I have seen a fair amount of low budget films, but this is just a lack of creativity and most of the time the use of it is absolutely meaningless. In the last (~20m?) of the movie, there is about 6 of them in which the main characters never move, they are just having conversation, and the screen fades to black and reopens with them in the same effing spot. Maybe they were trying to go for dramatics? I have no idea.

But that brings us to random shaky screen effects. It adds absolutely nothing to the movie (except maybe motion sickness for the audience) when the screen is shaking like the cameraman is jogging on a treadmill trying to film the video. Though, that may have had more to do with the trend that was occurring while this film was being made.

The plot:
It is like a middle school student had to write an essay for an English class and did it the night before. Save for a bit of a twist at the end, it is the most underdeveloped plot I have seen, and actually beats out Napoleon Dynamite for that trophy. Halfway through I am  begging for the female lead to be killed off, because apart from finding out that she inadvertently kills her husband, she adds absolutely nothing to the story. Just screaming and yelling and making bad decisions. Also, who is Rick? He randomly tries to call her, and this is the first we learn of him, then  he shows up at the house takes her with him, drops of the kid and vanishes again? It's like halfway through writing it the author/director decided he didn't want the kid to be harmed so he threw Rick in there to get the kid out and made him vanish as fast as he appeared, then went back and added the phone call in to the previous part of the story to TRY to make it seem like he was part of the story whole time? Nah, fit in perfectly. I can't even continue to explain this because it is just frustrating that I watched the whole thing expecting something ground breaking to happen and it didn't

My wife and I, both in the medical field for over 20 years each, have often wondered what we would do if faced with a real-life disaster scenario, not unlike what is depicted here. ""Right At Your Door"" was certainly low-budget, but not low on great acting and high tension. It was done very well, very edge-of-your-seat.

3264119,2,B000YIGNCW,"Right at Your Door (Chris Gorak, 2006)

I've had Right at Your Door sitting in my Amazon movie wishlist for I don't know how longprobably since it first came out. Once I resubscribed to Netflix, I moved it straight into the DVD queue, and when it showed up for Instant Streaming, I moved it over and watched it within a couple of days (given the size my my Instant queueoh, excuse me, My Listthat happens approximately once in a blue moon). I wish, given all that, I could say it's a better movie than it is. It's not an entirely awful one, but it certainly didn't live up to I've been waiting seven years to see this.

I will tell you right off in the synopsis that if you're watching this one at Netflix Instant, this is another one of those movies where if I had implemented it, the Netflix Synopsis Accuracy meter would be sitting right there at zero. The Netflix Synopsis had me believing that Brad (Argo's Rory Cochrane), our hero, is sitting in his house just outside the radius of the dirty bomb attacks that hit Los Angeles at the beginning of the movie, becoming increasingly crazier and more paranoid, to the point where he's gibbering and drooling in the corner, eating his wife Lexi (K-PAX's Mary McCormick) after cooking her thigh over a bonfire or something. I'm sure there's a way that could be farther than what actually happens, but I can't offhand think of it. Instead, Lexi goes off to work, the dirty bombs hit, Brad's at home camping out with the neighbor's gardener, Alvaro (Scarface's Tony Perez), and trying to reach Lexi via cellphone, which is of course impossible after a terrorist attack. There's also a neighborhood kid, Timmy (Scotty Noyd Jr., who had the misfortune to be in Dark House), who's afraid to go home because...well, that gets into the second half of the movie, at which point we are heading deep into spoiler territory. There are also government agents. Talking about them is not getting into spoiler territory, because if you've seen any two movies about terrorist attacks that contain government agents, you know which side they're on.

The setup is good, if a little understated; I figured Gorak was just taking his time getting the tension ramped up. And then it never got started...and never got started...and never got started. Drama, not thriller. But a little tension works well in a drama, and besides that, it's obvious from the pacing and the sequence of events that this is meant to be a thriller, so in the end, it simply misses the mark. Still, you can see glimpses of what could have been, and if that works for you, give this one a shot. **",1391212800,,2600,4.611231101511879

He felt the same way that the film was okay until the unexpected ending. I found that it's not a movie you can watch multiple times though. On my second watch of it, I was quite bored but was more interested in the reaction it would receive from the other person I was watching it with (their first time). Whilst I've watched movies multiple times without boredom, this one is more of a one time watch.

3264165,4,B000YIGNCW,"A rather well done film.

Not much character development, but the film gets off to a dramatic start quite quickly. Overall, a dark, emotional film that had me asking myself, ""What would I do.""

With my background in Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) training, the husband did just about all the correct protective measures a civilian can take - including preventing his wife from entering the house. Some minor mistakes regarding the military uniforms/equipment and the mobilization of Reserves vs. National Guard, but nothing too horrible.

Like other reviewers, I suspected a ""history"" between Jason and the wife Lexi, but that plot thread isn't followed up on with definition. Perhaps leaving the viewer to assume a history and admire the husband (Brad) for accepting and forgiving his wife's history with Jason. An affair or a former boyfriend - it's an unanswered question.

Several reviewers of this film have stated anger at the husband for not letting the wife inside. That's the plot writer's idea - to strike at the emotions of the viewer. As can be read by the posts, the writer clearly succeeded. Other reviewers comment that they would have forced their way inside the house to the husband. Hmmmm....let's think about this, I'm contaminated, gee....I think I'll force my way inside the house and cause the death of my spouse by exposing him to contamination as well. Ah, now that's true love! Let's hope for the spouses of those reviewers, that they are never exposed to such a situation as portrayed in this film.",1306195200,,1529,4.984313725490196

After a series of 'dirty bombs' encase Los Angeles in a poisonous cloud, a husband and his infected wife must struggle to survive on opposite sides of the plastic sheets sealing their home. Mixed reports delivered in a Wellesian fashion filter in through the radio and television broadcasts, while the couple must hide to avoid capture from suspicious military officials. The film strikes an emotional chord in the wake of 9/11, tapping in to real life terrors that hit close to home. Director Chris Gorak implements a hyper-kinetic filming and editing style that intensifies the frantic pace and panic in the streets, while the tiny windows into the outside world delivered through the media create a huge scope on a small scale. Just when the script seems like it has no where to go due to its cramped shooting location, jarring suspense sequences and sharp twists maintain a steady forward momentum. The limited cast members deliver powerful and effective performances that also serve to drive an emotional high from start to finish. Lock your doors, seal your windows, then pop in RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR for a smart and frightening disaster flick.

3264182,4,B000YIGNCW,"This is a powerful indy thriller that demonstrates what can be achieved with a small budget as long as you have a good idea, a good script, and a good cast. The cinematography is impressive, as is the first time direction from Gorak. The performances are convincing, adding weight to this disturbing examination of the effects of terrorist activities on Mr and Mrs Everyman. Their struggle to survive makes for harrowing viewing, and, although it does run out of steam in the middle, it provides a memorable experience. It's a shame that a little humour wasn't injected, particularly during the slightly flat mid-section, and the ending, on reflection, seems just a tad contrived.

3264183,2,B000YIGNCW,"This movie frankly irritated me. The pivotal moment is where husband who has been distraught at the possibility of wife being lost in the anthrax cloud rejoices at seeing her return, but is too spineless to allow her back into THEIR house (probably paid for mostly by her) lest she contaminate him. From that instant, even if they were both to survive, that marriage is toast. This aspect is hardly even alluded to in the film itself - now, OK, wife reckons she is doomed anyway so perhaps it's not her numero uno concern at that moment ... but over a timescale of a couple of days, might it not cross her mind? .... hey, come on! Poisonally, I would not even want a spouse like him weeping over my mass grave and nor should she.

It's a low-budget, independent type of film, but I was quite riveted by it nonetheless. Well, mostly. While I was dutifully chilled to the bone by the images, predicaments and consequences presented in the film, there were some things that didn't quite jell for me. Still, I give it thumbs up for scaring the bejesus outta me and turning my skin as cold as stone, like all good apocalyptic type stories do.",1253577600,11,695,4.523809523809524
3264186,5,B000YIGNCW,"""WOW"" was the word I kept silently mouthing as I watched this film.  Cinematography, flawless acting, and an endlessly foreboding tone and script come together for the most engrossing cinematic experience I've had in some time.  Slight spoilers follow, but they all follow under this umbrella: ""This is a small interpersonal story taking place within your typical disaster movie.""

The strength of the script is two-fold: First, it employs a gritty realism via the only source of information the main characters have on hand: the radio news station.  The story of the disaster that has befallen the outer world unfolds through this mechanism, the application of which should trigger memories of 9/11 for all but the most obtuse.  The comparison, however, is never explicitly made, and the implied connection between the American disaster and the events in this film is applied with finesse and grace.

Second, the script and direction trust the intelligence of the viewer.  In particular, subtle use of the radio provides small doorways into the current psychological states of the characters.  Hence, the film isn't nearly as interesting or engaging if the viewer does not surrender their full attention.  For the right viewer, however, that won't be the slightest problem.  Additionally, there are any number of nuances to the relationships between the main characters; catching them all requires even more attentiveness.  The director isn't hiding these things, however.  These extra spices simply contribute to the feeling that the audience is watching real people.  Plot points aren't telegraphed 20 minutes in advance in real life.

This riveting package comes in a small box.  It was filmed on a small budget, but the claustrophobic quarters that provide the setting for the majority of the movie only add to the horror and futility of the situation.  Considering that this is Chris Gorak's first film, I haven't been this excited about a debut since Shane Carruth's Primer (what's HE up to now?).  Hitchcock ain't got nothin' on Chris Gorak!

Highly, HIGHLY Recommended!",1252454400,4,2078,5.2265861027190335
3264187,3,B000YIGNCW,"Lexi (Mary McCormack) gets in her car and drives to work. Brad (Rory Cochrane) seems to want to patch up an argument they had the night before. Terrorists start blowing up dirty, virus carrying bombs all across Los Angeles. In a brief and effective fashion, ""Right At Your Door"" begins.

Problem is, this suspense/drama doesn't have the moxy to stay interesting for its 90-some minute running time. It probably would have made a great 40 minute short or a decent made for TV hour long. Despite the realistic premise and the tightened focus of the film, it never gets a real firm pace. It really wants to be a two-actor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Beach/dp/B00004SGB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Beach</a>. Instead, it's a talky soap opera that often gets ridiculous in the ""suspend your disbelief"" department.

For instance, it is perfectly acceptable that, once Brad hears that bombs are going off in the city, he freaks out and rushes off to find his wife. It's plausible that the cops would start forcibly turning people away and drive Brad back to the house. It's even likely that a panicky neighborhood handyman might rush into your home looking for help. But if your wife came back and begged for help, would you be able to demand she stay out of the house, knowing she would most certainly die? If you were the one locked out and fatal toxins were snowing down around you, would you cave in or start smashing your way in? And if you were doomed to sit near each other while likely dying, would you just sit there and yack yack yack for days?

That's the problem with ""Right At Your Door."" The realistic scenario is undone by the illogical choices made by Lexi and Brad. The film also takes plot turns that are left undeveloped. When Jason (seemingly an ex-boyfriend) suddenly appears outside and tries to convince Lexi to leave Brad and save herself, Brad is more upset in the ""what the hell is he doing here"" manner than the ""Don't leave me"" way. But then the thread just vanishes, along with Jason. Why is he there? What did he mean to Lexi? Then there's the little kid, Timmy. He added some real artistic tension at the beginning by being the human prop that made you look at Los Angeles in flames, but his re-emergence in the film is pointless.

In fact, the visuals in ""Right At Your Door"" are more interesting than anything else. That one look at Los Angeles under attack was more unnerving than anything else in the movie. The falling toxic ash shot was also very effective, as were the ash-coated dead birds. The use of radio broadcasts helped convey the claustrophobic helplessness Brad felt locked inside his house. Had writer/director Chris Gorak stayed more with these kind of cues, maybe cast a pair of more believable actors and tightened the script, ""Right At Your Door"" might have been more like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>&nbsp;and less like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AVP-Alien-Vs-Predator/dp/B00005JMZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AVP - Alien Vs.

3264188,5,B000YIGNCW,"Having seen the positive reviews and the negative reviews for this movie, I had to enter in my own for the first time because I believe that the reason people are reviewing it negatively is because they were A) expecting a horror movie, which this is not, B) don't seem to understand that in a crisis situation such as the one depicted here, yes, people in reality WOULD be screaming at each other, cursing, not thinking straight, panicking and worse, and that it's hardly overdone in this movie, or C) just mad at the characters for not being smarter or more able to anticipate the nature of the mysterious toxic threat since, well, you know, everyone and their mother these days are apparently experts on biological/chemical/radiologic agents.

If you think you can watch this movie without A, B, or C, then I think you're going to enjoy it, and at the very least, it will make you think about some of the hard questions that emergency personnel must ask when they are responding to a large-scale event . . . and the questions we must ask ourselves as possible victims of such an event.

The characters are a realistic couple (reminds me of Rashida Jones's character, Ann, and her boyfriend from Parks and Recreation!), and although you don't get too much character development before the terrorist attack, in my mind they were very believable, very real, and everyday people with realistic responses to the situations presented in the film.  Most of the negative reviews seem to rip on the characters and their reactions to what occurred in the movie as atypical and unbelievable, but I found them to be quite plausible and consistent for people under stress and threat of death, and who were simply trying to survive while being pummeled repeatedly and emotionally by the evolving disaster.

I won't give away the ending, but through it all, you, the viewer, can't help but ask yourself what you would do in the situation.  Presented with an unbearable decision to make, what would you do . . . would you survive at any cost, would you be true to higher moral standards, would you want your loved ones to sacrifice themselves for you, would you trust in your government and neighbors to see you through, would you sacrifice yourself for the good of others?  And what, if any, consequences could you eventually face for your decisions?

The one thing I will agree with as far as the negatives surrounding this film involves the biochemical agent in question.  It is 100% unrealistic for the agent, as described (but I won't give it away), to demonstrate the properties it does in the movie from a purely scientific perspective.  However, if one can suspend their disbelief on this one aspect of the film, and instead commit to the uncertainty of the nature of the biochemical threat as a core part of what moves this film, the rest of it is quite a ride.",1247011200,4,2857,4.709418837675351

For as little attention that is paid to it, the premises could have been about a surprise shortage of Gummy Bears. The principal characters of this disaster, (the movie not the subject,) are quite possibly the two stupidest people in the galaxy.

Almost the entire 86 waterboarding minutes are spent watching these two high school drama rejects running around the house in a state confused panic. The male of the two, - played by Rory Cochrane- has Duct Taped himself into his house in oder to avoid ingesting the killer ash that his girlfriend -played by Mary McCormack- on the other side of the plastic has been breathing in like Tony Montana getting geared up for a backyard firefight. Strike number one for this douche. If it's the woman I love; I'm dying with her if I have to, but I'm not leaving her alone on the other side of some Visqueen.

Cochrane divides his time up between running around the house screaming and yelling the same questing or instructions to his girlfriend over and over, and nurturing his complete inability to make even the simplest  decision such as whether to make a phone call or not.

Every time one of them shouts, (a normal tone of voice from these two is about as rare as plutonium 239,) to the other they go out of their way to ignore each other. Neither one seems to have any interest in what the other is trying to tell them no matter how important it might be.

I couldn't understand after his girlfriend left the first time to get to a hospital why she returned. Surly a lung chocking death in a barren urban landscape is better fate. If I was Duct Taped in a house with Cochrane I'd claw my way outside and be jamming toxic ash in my mouth like Rosie O'donnell at an all you can eat Haggen Daz buffet.

3264201,4,B000YIGNCW,"With so many Americans having settled back in to a pre-9/11 mindset, Right At Your Door is a timely and pretty effective wake-up call, really hitting close to home with the ever-present danger of international terrorism.  I have no idea why the working title of this film was once Forearm Shiver, but the final choice of title fits the story perfectly.  Brad (Rory Cochrane) and Lexi (Mary McCormack) are sort of a modern-day Everyman and Everywoman (she works while he practices - or not - with his ""band"") whose normal lives are shattered by a series of explosions across nearby Los Angeles.  As if that weren't bad enough, the drama reaches a sustained crescendo at the couple's very door - literally.  Plenty of films make you wonder what you might do in a certain character's shoes, but Right at Your Door takes it to an extreme, all but demanding that you take a stand on one of the most difficult of questions.

Brad is performing the most mundane of tasks - brushing his teeth - when the local radio station interrupts the music to announce that multiple bombs have exploded all across Los Angeles.  Unable to reach his wife (who works in LA) on the phone, he jumps in the car and heads out into the chaos to find her and bring her home.  Turned back by policemen blocking the city off from incoming traffic, he returns home and soon learns that some sort of dirty bombs were used in the attacks.  As the deadly ash makes it way toward his location, he holds out as long as possible, hoping his wife will suddenly turn up at the door,  before rushing to seal off the house - with the help of a construction worker from next door who has come there seeking refuge - from the deadly fallout.  Then, not long thereafter, the miraculous occurs, and his wife is in fact there at the door, still living and breathing and asking - then demanding - that Brad let her in.

What would you do?  Would you let your soot-covered, contaminated spouse into your house or would you heed the advice of government leaders and deny her entry, hoping that medical help will arrive in time to save her?  Knowing she has been exposed to whatever chemical or biological substance the dirty bombs were packed with, Brad must make an agonizing decision.  Since that decision pretty much sets up the final hour of the film, I will not reveal it here in the context of this review - nor will I even offer a hint as to the nature of the ending (except to say that I think it works rather well).

If you're looking for heart-stopping, blockbuster special effects or visceral horror, Right at Your Door is sure to disappoint you on those counts.  This is very much a character-driven story.  Even if writer/director Chris Gorak had had more than a limited budget to work with, I don't think he would have shot the film any differently, as a bunch of distracting special effects would have interfered with the interpersonal dynamics at the heart of his story.  Brad can see smoke from the nearby explosions, but his only real source of information is the radio (he and Lexi just moved into this house and this was the very day that the cable guy was supposed to come out and get their television set up).  This only adds to the insular feel of the drama playing out before our eyes.  Having said that, though, I do have to admit that the film didn't pull me in as powerfully as I thought it would.  While Brad and Lexi obviously love one another, there's seemingly a lack of chemistry in their relationship.  I felt as if one of the home's many layers of plastic sheeting and duct tape found its way between me and the characters - just enough to prevent me from truly embracing this couple and their awful plight.  Still, Right at Your Door is a memorable and well-made film built around a most fascinating premise - and quite a debut for first-time director Gorak.",1233532800,4,3843,4.505763688760807

I would have had a better review had the movie actually been what was on the box. The ending was cheap and contrived. You're expecting some awesome event only to find, naturally, the military is our enemy. Now, is that a new and original twist?

3264203,4,B000YIGNCW,"It's present day Los Angeles, and terrorists have detonated several ""dirty bombs"" in the heart of the city.  The immediate damage is bad enough, but these bombs are carrying a deadly toxin in their ash, and it's starting to blow out to the suburbs.  Many hundreds of thousands of are dead or likely to die.

RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR posits the above scenario...but as a very low budget film, we see the story from the point of view of two suburbanites, Brad (Rory Cochrane) and Lexi (Mary McCormack).  This thirty-something, childless couple are moving into a new house, and in the morning, Lexi heads off to her downtown job with a cellphone that needs charging.  Brad, who might be some sort of musician or something that keeps him at home, goes about his day.

A chilling scene occurs.  We see Brad brushing his teeth, listening to some rock on the radio.  Suddenly, the familiar sound that signals a ""test of the emergency broadcast system"" starts.  How many times have we heard that.  We know exactly how long that tone goes on before the ""this is a test"" starts.  So does Brad, so when the tone goes on longer than usual, we see the tension enter his body...just as it would ours.  We KNOW something that isn't a test is about to happen.

Brad hears that downtown LA has been hit with explosions.  He tried to call Lexi...but remember, her phone is dead.  In the early scenes of the movie, we see him panicking and running for this car to go find his wife.  He sees scenes of growing chaos around him, smoke in the distance and a rapidly increasing police presence.  He even witnesses the police shooting a man who has clearly made it to the suburbs from downtown because his car is covered in ash.

Brad reluctantly goes back home.  He's joined in his house by an elderly Hispanic man who had been doing some work on the house next door.  The man tells Brad they need to seal up the house before the toxic ash comes their way.  Brad, naturally, is reluctant to seal his wife out...but eventually he agrees, and they tape up the house just as the ash begins to drift down.

But then Lexi shows up, obviously already feeling the effects of what she's been exposed to...and Brad cannot let his wife into the house.  From there, emotional, physical and moral challenges occur.  I don't want to tell you any more, because describing the plot is hardly the point anyway.

The TONE of RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR is what grabs us.  At first, we understand the panic & fear than anyone would feel.  Seeing this movie via Brad's point of view not only makes it work within the limited budget...but it makes the scale of the disaster personal and we can empathize.  Later, as news from the scene becomes murky and rumors of what's ""really happening"" at the hospitals and quarantine sites begins to spread...a feeling of dread and paranoia sets in.  The movie isn't quite taking the path of ""the cure is worse than the disease"" or ""we are our own worst enemies"" by showing soldiers who will shoot anyone or Americans killing each other...but it does convincingly show how common sense can collide with fear, and when mixed with sketchy information, can lead to some bad choices.

RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR gets a lot of details right.  This isn't a nuclear explosion after all...so electricity remains mostly on and the radio / TV coverage is constant.  Cell phone service continues unabated, and we get a sense, through calls with family members, of an ""outside world"" that is physically untouched and normal...but also reeling with the enormity of what has happened.

Mary McCormack (who is doing such a nice job on the new TV series ""In Plain Sight"") is convincing as the wife who is at first appalled at being locked out of her own house and then finds reserves of bravery.  If only her eye makeup hadn't been so terribly bad (she's been crying, you see, so much of the makeup is smeared all over her face during much of the movie).  But it is Rory Cochrane, whom I'm sure I've seen before but never taken notice of, who owns the movie.  He's in literally all but two or three scenes...and his ordinary guy demeanor is just right for the film.  He's not a coward...but he is full of fear anyway.  He loves his wife...but also fears his own death if he touches her again.  The dynamics between the two are almost as interesting as figuring out everything that's going on around the disaster.

The film is not perfect.  Although it's only 96 minutes...it feels stretched.  Some scenes in the middle seem to cover the same ground a few times.  I think 10 minutes could have been lost and the film would have had a very crisp pace.  As it is, it drags at times.  And the nighttime scenes are TOO murky.

Writer/director Chris Goran, with a background as an art director, has made a very nice first film.  It has ambitious themes and it knows its limits VERY well.  The budget never feels stretched.  He makes the needed small scale work for him, because it adds to the mood of isolation.

(I hope I've made it very clear that this is a drama about moral choices we make in the face of extreme stress and danger.  It is NOT an action movie or a horror movie or a sci-fi movie...or a political movie.  I've seen a few reviews from viewers who clearly expected such and thus blasted the film.)

RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR also has an unneeded but still effective surprise in store at the end.  It felt a little like a gimmick...but was still chilling.

3264206,1,B000YIGNCW,"As has increasingly become the case, I made the mistake of trusting horror buff movie reviewers at a certain ""bloody"" website once again and ended up renting (thankfully not buying) this arty little throwaway of a flick.
Right at Your Door tells the tale of a young married couple living in Los Angeles whose affections and committment for each other are put to the ultimate test when they become the victims of a terrorist biochemical attack.
The movie begins somewhat servicably enough with a decent score by TomandAndy, as we are introduced to a young couple whose marriage may or may not be a little strained due to the fact that the wife is the primary bread winner. While on her way to work the terrorist dirty bomb attack goes down with husband (Cochrane, an underratted actor in my opinion) trying frantically to reach his wife by any and all means to see if she's alright.
Eventually we learn that the bomb has unleashed unknown chemicals into the air and has sent the city into a panic.
SPOILERS AHEAD: Long story short, the wife makes it back to the house where her husband has already taped up the windows and doors forming a makeshift quarrantine. Various silly attempts at tension and drama ensue and then before you know it, the movie (which seems a lot longer than it is because it's boring) ends on a completely foreseeable note when we learn that the husband has doomed himself, and not his wife, by locking himself in the house and her out. Confused? don't be, the movie sucks.
And I'm not judging it on the basis of it's obviously limited budget, nor the actors, who both do a wonderful job with such an amateurish script and story to work with.

Our main character desperately tries to get to his wife through a torrent of confusion, police officers, and onlookers. Distraught, he returns home. And stays there. The rest of the film is spent in the confines of the house. There is never any real sense of the monumental disaster going on downtown. It is only the fear and panic of a few people, and it is explored only on a superficial level.

In fact, this reminds me of an off Broadway play. You get glimpses of smoke in the background, occasional sirens, peeks out of the window, but there is little here that couldn't be found on stage. The movie attempts to capture the raw emotion of a man, his wife, and a neighbor in crisis and isolated, but the result is downright boring. There is little connection to the plight of the city and its residents, and the disconnect makes this largely uninteresting. Yes, there is a twist at the end, but it doesn't make up for the lack of tension or storyline required to get to it.",1208995200,3,1117,4.422330097087379

3264209,1,B000YIGNCW,"Watch out for the Dirty Bomb!

No, silly, I'm talking about this movie!

Meet crack business warrior Lexi (Mary McCormack bringing home the bacon AND frying it up in a pan AND...uh, FRYING): hard-charging yuppie on a mission. The Early Bird gets the Germ!

Meet schlubby unemployed loser husband Brad (shlubby unemployed loser actor Rory Cochrane): watch as he ponders the breathless pace of his morning---will it be cheese doodles? Dr. Phil? Cheese Doodles *with* Dr. Phil?

WATCH! There really are Two Americas---Lexi in the one that works, Brad in the one that doesn't (but chums off America #1). So tighly-wound yuppie chick on a mission Lexi gets up early and motors it onto the LA freeway, while schlubby husband Brad, unemployed, part of a 'band' (hey, man, he's got guitars to prove it! he's cool! yeah!) schlubbs around the house after trying a little AM whoopee (dead sexy, Brad! hot! rowwwr you Romeo you!) with the wife.

Lexi goes to work. Brad stays home, presumably to chill on the couch, eat cheese doodles, watch Dr. Phil.

GASP! As Terrorists, meanwhile, bored of GTA4 with nothing better to do, do a little urban jihad on old LA with a bunch of combo hit LA with a bunch of combo chemical/biological bombs that turn everyone in hotzone (translation: workers of the world, exfoliate!) into walking geiger counters, Lexi included, and soon LA has more air quality worries than a little smog.

Brad, meanwhile, gets to---uh, stay in the house, eat cheese doodles, and lounge around on the couch. Score one for Brad!

MORAL #1: Being unemployed and lounging around the house watching Dr. Phil and eating cheese doodles is a lot better than sucking down a load of Ebola Zaire-Anthrax-Mustard Gas blister agent! And it's even more useful than stocking up on bottled water and duct tape if you wanna make it through a terrorist dirty bomb attack!

MORAL #2: The Glass Ceiling ain't got a thing on the Anthrax Ceiling!

MORAL #3: Terrorists don't really appreciate the whole ""Earth Day"" thing.

Director Chris Gorak (formerly artistic director for Fight Club, etc., and that full command of grungy authenticity does come through here) really tries to generate a kind of crescendo of mortal terror with ""Right at your Door"", and you've got all the nods to the great apocalyptic flicks: soldiers and fuzz in hotsuits and gas masks grunting out muffled orders, the city sinking mortally wounded into terror, and death, and darkness, and some workably impressive backdrops of a doomed and dying Los Angeles cityscape.

It would work nicely if the movie weren't a complete bore.

It could be a stage show, comprised of three characters: Shlubby Brad, Sexy Lexi, and the next door neighbor's Mexican handyman who Brad inexplicably bonds with, proving there are no atheists in foxholes, but there sure are a lot of weirdos.

Given that the handyman gets bored and wanders off midway through the show (I feel your pain, amigo!), that means ""Right at your Snore"" is an intimate little duel between two characters. That would work if we're talking David Mamet (a la ""Glengarry Glen Ross""), but here we're more at the level of Oprah (a la ""Women who love Men who love Midgets with Big Butts).

Nothing really happens. The three characters take turns looking 1) nervous 2) constipated 3) nervously constipated 4) dialing around on their cell phones & texting 5) drinking bottled water. That's it. Occasionally The Man comes around (in gas mask! In hazmat suit! with machine gun! rat a tat tat!) looking a little confused and pokes a flashlight at Brad.

Here the tension boils down to this: can Brad get his fat butt off the couch long enough to call 911? Don't believe me? Here's a sampling of film dialogue:

BRAD: Honey, I'm so sorry, I hate that you gotta sit out there on the porch and die. Hey where did you put the cheese doodles?

LEXI: I'm glad you're safe honey! I'm glad you stayed home and watched dr. phil! Does this portable gas mask make my butt look fat?

The biggest problem with ""Right"" is I didn't believe a minute of it.

Bottom line: take a good hard look at Lexi. Then check out Brad. Go ahead. I'll wait. Back? OK: you and I both know if Brad did what he did to Lexi at about 30 minutes in, it would have taken her about 2 seconds to do a SWAT roll through the kitchen door and sent Brad (courtesy of the Flying Roundhouse Chop) for a little quality time with the formica floor. Terminated! With Extreme Prejudice!

Check out that little crinkly delta of pure red rage wrinkles that crop up around the time she realizes her unemployed loser husband is keeping her out of her own home: yeah, baby, it's CLOBBERIN' TIME! If Lexi had drop-kicked Brad across the dinette set at that moment, this flick would have gotten 5 stars. Mary McCormack actually is a real champ with her preposterous role (in any decent flick she would have been wearing Brad's ears for a war necklace about 5 minutes after his ""you keep a knockin but you can't come in"" moment.

I mean, jeez: Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus, sure, but when Venus gets a little gas that's grounds for making her park it on the back porch forever?

Truth in advertising: this movie stinks. I guess it really *is* a Dirty Bomb.

3264210,2,B000YIGNCW,"""Right At Your Door"" was a huge disappointment from the start until about four minutes before the credits. It reminds me of ""Monster"" (no, not the one with Charlize Theron, the other one. The stupid one). It starts out auspiciously enough, with the ""bombing"" of L.A., then degenerates quite quickly from there. Rory Cochrane is unconvincing as Brad, the Husband. Mary Mc Cormack, as Lexi, the Wife, is just as bad.

Things move rather quickly during the bombing, but come to a screeching halt once Brad makes it back home. When Lexi finally decides she's had enough of running around like a chicken with it's head cut off, and makes it back home, as well, it's just yap, yap, yap at the back door, for much too long. I caught a little snooze time, as the next thing I saw, was Lexi being dragged off by someone in a bio suit, saying that she was the lucky one! Brad is convieniently ""put out of his misery"" with a gas that is piped into the house, to kill the virus/fungus/bugaboo, because it has incubated IN the house all that time! WOW! I sat through all that for THIS (well, it's at least better than ""Monster"")?!

That this dreck won awards at the Sundance Film Festival does not bode well for Independent Film. I expected better from Independent Filmmakers, as it appeared that they were the only ones to ""go outside the envelope"". Or, this could just be a fluke.

3264211,2,B000YIGNCW,"This is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, it is not very deep, it lacks emotion, good acting, and a plausible plot, but oh how ironic this film ends up being. You want irony? You got irony, and little else.

The film takes place in LA after a series of ""dirty bombs"" have gone off in downtown turning the streets of Americas 2nd largest city into a battlefield overnight. Husband and wife Brad and Lexi wake up one typical sunny day and go about their lives as usual. Lexi dries downtown to work while Brad stays home. Suddenly Brad feels the ground shake, hears a distant boom, and then messages start to come over the radio about a terrorist attack in the downtown area. After a useless attempt to find his wife, Brad seals himself off in his home and tries to make sense of the situation unfolding around him though scattered and confused radio reports.

The film is basically yet another play on our post 9/11 fears. This kind of movie has been done so many times since the towers fell that it's no longer original, depressing, and, more importantly, it's no longer scary. How many times are independent film makers, lacking in budget and talent, going to keep making this same movie over and over and over again? When will it stop? It is good to remember that day, but it isn't necessary to bombard us with these constant speeches and ""artsy"" films. Right at your Door is just another independent film trying to do its best with a low budget by pulling on our emotional strings and relying far too much on the events of 9/11 for its main themes. Not to say that's a bad thing, obviously films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>, which came out earlier this year, managed to do just that in a very convincing way, but there are dozens of poorly made low budget independent films that all try to do basically the same thing. This film is nothing special.

The acting is okay overall, with Mary McCormack giving a superb performance as Lexi, while Rory Cochrane's portrayal of Brad was bland and unconvincing. The real meat of this film comes from what little we see of the devastation of LA. Although we see relatively little- the whole film takes place in their home and rarely moves outside of it- what we are shown of the disaster is stunning in its realism. The poison ashes raining from the sky like snow, a little boy staring at the smoke rising in the distance, its all very haunting and is far and away the best thing this film does. Unfortunately the suspense and dread built up in this film dies away as the film goes on. SPOILER!!!! Why is it, after about three days of being exposed to the poisons, does Lexi not feel any of its effects other then a cough when the news says people are dieing in the streets? END OF SPOILER!!! Why does Brad's car still drive after getting a flat tire? It doesn't make much sense.

This movie has some seriously twisted irony at the end, but it really isn't that hard to see coming, and it's hard to care when it does come because the characters aren't really the kind of people you'd care about. Who cares what happens to these people? Overall it's not really a film worth spending time and money on seeing, but if you HAVE to see it make sure you don't spend more then a couple dollars to do it and keep your hand on the fast forward button.",1206662400,3,3424,4.617405582922824

A disturbing film and a vision one hopes remains confined to cinema.  Other eras had Godzilla and other monsters spawned from atomic fallout.

I remember seeing the trailers for this movie quite awhile back, and it looked very interesting. So when I saw it sitting in the DVD isle, I snagged it right away, even though I started to expect bad things since it I figured it was going to be in theaters, but apparently not.

I don't remember names so we'll go with Husband and Wife. They both just moved to LA and are still unpacking into their new house. Wife has to go to work and Husband stays home to keep unpacking. A terrorist attack occurs in the city while Wife is in the city. Husband doesnt know what to do. You can tell he's definitely in love with his wife because even though the news is saying to stay at home and that a dirty bomb has exploded downtown, he still takes off to find her. Without accomplishing what he set out to do he returns home to wait for his wife. When she eventually shows up (this was all in the previews so I'm not trying to ruin anything) is when basically the emotional and mind-bothering scenes begin to happen. I try to picture myself in a situation like this and sometimes I cant figure out what I would do. Do I risk letting her in? Would I want to live without her even if she IS infected? Even if I wanted to die with her...would I be to scared to go out the way she does since the virus could be excruciatingly painful? This part of the movie really does get to you.

But sometimes I wonder if they even think that. Sure they love each other...but sometimes you just wonder. When you see some of the actions they both do in the movie (mainly her), you have to wonder..WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? I'll tell you my biggest problem with Wife that won't ruin the movie. During the movie, you see cops and the military on the public streets doing sweeps of neighborhoods trying to locate individuals caught outside. Well Husband wants Wife to stay in the backyard and he even sealed off the house from the bedroom that has a sliding door to the outside so she could have a bed and fresh water and food he placed in there before he sealed off. Well she's on her cell phone talking and talking and just walking around...not staying in the house...and then walking to the side of the house where she can be seen. I'm thinking to myself ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" Parts like that really aggravated me about this movie and it happens a lot.

Another reason why I just think this is a SO-SO movie is how boring it could be at times. I thought it was much to drawn out, and parts in the movie just didn't need to be there. Also me and my friend both pretty much guessed the whole movie (almost) down to the ending. Though through our thought process we came up with a MUCH better movie than we were watching..heh.

3264218,5,B000YIGNCW,"I don't know what happened to ""Right at Your Door."" I don't know why it wasn't given a larger theatrical release and why the DVD has hit video stores without any support. Could be that it hit too close to too many people's post-9/11 terrors and, as a result, was just too damned scary.

This incredibly tense apocalyptic thriller follows what happens to a happy, middle-class couple when a series of dirty bombs explode in Los Angeles. Rory Cochrane plays Brad, a musician/slacker who's recently moved into a new home with his wife, Lexi (Mary McCormack). When the film opens he's staying home to finish unpacking boxes and she's driving downtown to go to work.

Then all hell breaks loose.

Working within an indie budget, writer/director Goran keeps the focus of his story tight and uses creativity to suggest the large-scale disaster he can't show. As someone once said, it's the horror you can't see that's most frightening because your imagination is always worse than the real thing, and the film takes advantage of this at every turn.

Goran creates an in-the-news tension and terrific mood by describing the bombs' destruction and chaos in a series of radio broadcasts that continue almost uninterrupted through the entire film. Brad first notices something is wrong when his morning news is interrupted by the urgent tone of the Emergency Broadcast System.

The phones are jammed and Brad can't contact Lexi, so he jumps into his car intending to drive downtown and get Lexi at work. He tears through the streets of his neighborhood as the radio announces additional explosions and greater destruction. When his rescue mission ends in police blockades just a few blocks away and the shooting of a man from downtown who's probably ""infected,"" Brad returns home.

Turns out the bombs are dirty, packed with radiation, chemicals and/or biologic agents. (The film never makes the exact mix clear -- another smart choice, because it mirrors the confusion that would actually follow such an event and makes the terror that much more effective. It also helps set up the film's dark ending.)

The radio warns listeners to seal up their homes and avoid contact with anyone who may come to them for aid. Brad and a handyman from next door wait for Lexi and watch as the fallout heads their way. When they can't wait any longer, they reluctantly seal up the house with duct tape and plastic tarps, but not before Brad puts a few supplies outside in case Lexi does make it home.

Which, of course, she does, frantic and covered in ash, grateful to finally be home, terrified and enraged when she realizes that Brad has shut her out and can't open the door. Even though the story lags a bit at this point -- the first 30 minutes' screaming panic just can't be sustained indefinitely -- it soon builds up steam and interest as Brad and Lexi struggle with the reality of their situation, negotiating their stand-off and figuring out a way to survive until help arrives.

Not everything disaster-related happens off-screen. Goran gives us some eerie shots of the Los Angeles skyline shrouded in gray clouds and a lovely but upsetting scene when toxic ash falls onto Brad and Lexi's backyard like snow.

Like ""Cloverfield,"" ""Right at Your Door"" makes a virtue of its limited perspective. But unlike this winter's big horror hit, there's not a lot of metaphor at work here. Goran admits in the DVD's bonus materials he was inspired by 9/11. Maybe it's because his monster is all-too plausible that executives got cold feet when it came time to market and release the film, even though it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and won for its cinematography. (This last one I don't get -- if I have one criticism it's with the film's sometimes muddy look.) For whatever reason, ""Right at Your Door"" limited U.S. theatrical release came and went with nary a word in August of 2007, virtually guaranteeing viewers would miss it. But don't be one of them. ""Right at Your Door"" is one of the scariest films I've seen in a long time.",1203292800,,4031,4.778735632183908
3264219,1,B000YIGNCW,"We don't care about these characters because the development is zero. When you finally do reach the ""twist"" you are so bored that you couldn't care less what happens to this couple. The film attempts to create these loving, sympathizing characters during extreme circumstances but fails miserably. Perhaps it is the use of over-the-top foul language that prevents the viewer from really wanting to feel for these people. I'm no prude and actually see how harsh language is sometimes realistic and adds to the drama but hearing people screaming, ""f*#k this"" and ""fu*king that"" 5-6 times in one minute is just ridiculous. Bring some knitting or your checkbook to balance because there is plenty of time for it. When the twist (FINALLY) comes I guess we're supposed to get all, ""Woe!

3264220,2,B000YIGNCW,"In the wake of the success of such films as ""28 Days (+Weeks) Later"", the ""Resident Evil"" trilogy, ""I Am Legend"", ""Cloverfield"" and a trillion others - some good, some terrible - to come out and make another apocalyptic drama, where the threat is massive and unstoppable, seems to be a risky move, especially with literally no budget to supplement it. The novelty of those films' relevance tends to quickly wear off, baring the so-called meat'n'bones that shape the film. Apart from the numerous nods to the current political chaos, the question is whether a film can stand on its own, with a strong plot to supplement the dreary poignancy of post-9/11 imagery.
""Right at Your Door"" cannot. It tries hard, mind you, or rather insistently attempts to keep the tension level sky high using only dialogue between two people, trapped in a situation that first comes off as truly terrible and heart-wrenching, but gradually becomes more and more unbelievable as the film progresses.
It seems like just another typical L.A. day, when struggling musician Brad (the reliable Rory Cochrane) wakes up next to the sexy wealthy Lexi (Mary McCormack) (oooh, can you see the conflict building here?). She's off to work; and then the film plunges right into its premise. Brad hears shocking reports on the radio about 'dirty bombs' going off in downtown L.A. His first priority is to get Lexi. The city emanating ominous black fumes in the background (hauntingly evoking 9/11), Brad races through the hilly neighborhood, fruitlessly trying to get through the panicking police. At this point, the audience is hooked: the tension is palpable, the situation all-too-real. Those early scenes are directed and edited so well, it's doubly disappointing to realize that the film stops short once Brad returns home (about 15 mins into the film) to find a frightened man who's rushed in from the chaotic streets, and together they begin to seal up the house. At this point it's clear Brad ain't getting out, and the action is going to be limited to indoors. When Lexi comes back through the rain of ash (an effective shot; one of the very few), coughing and spitting blood, Brad refuses to let her in, and the film hangs on their dialogue, spoken through a shield of firmly-taped plastic.
Richard Linklater did it in ""Tape"" and ""Before Sunset"", but Chris Gorak (art-director on films like ""Fight Club"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") is no Linklater - here the conversation between husband and wife fails at sustaining interest. It's 'been there, seen that' territory. You can predict the characters' actions (not that they do all that much to begin with). There are a few scenes that approach a mild level of suspense, most of them involving angry, unresponsive dudes in masks questioning Brad through the sealed doors. And if the outcome does come a bit unexpectedly, to call it satisfying would be a long stretch. It actually makes less and less sense the more you think about it.
So while ""Right at Your Door"" starts off on a high note, it literally disintegrates into low-budget drivel - cruel, shriek-y, depressing pseudo-artsy fair. It says nothing new about terrorism, or its effects, and what it does say is bleak and monotonous. A better director, say, Danny Boyle, may have turned this film into an edge-of-your-seat apocalyptic drama.

****SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW****

The main character, Brad was completely unlikable in every way. He is a leech who lives off of his girlfriend, Lexi. She wakes up in the morning because she has to go to work to support him and he gives her the guilt trip because he wants to have sex since he doesn't work and isn't tired.
After the bomb goes off he cries like a baby and acts as if he can't live without his girlfriend (he probably can't). Then we she comes home after the disaster he won't let her in the house because he's afraid he might catch something. Unbelievable! Suddenly he can live without her. He makes her sit outside all day and takes his time preparing a room for her. This takes all of a few minutes.

The handyman neighbor has to do almost all the work of sealing up the house because Brad wants to sit around and cry and be depressed. Brad then spends most of the movie giving the neighbor an attitude and acts as if he should be kissing his rear for letting him stay there. You'd think Brad would want to have company at a time like that.

The neighbor is also seriously lacking in common sense. After calling everyone he knows looking for his wife and knowing that if he goes outside he will surely die, what does he do?....he decides to go outside and look for her despite a quarantine.

The side story with the kid goes basically nowhere.

Let's face facts here, Lexi could have gotten into the house if she wanted to. How hard would it have been to break the glass and open the door.

The behavior of the soldiers was completely unrealistic. There is no way they would treat Brad the way they did. There is no way they would handle the situation like they did. I mean really...board up the house with Brad in it and light it on fire. Come on! The fire could spread anywhere and the stuff they were trying to contain would surely get free. It's not as if this is a post-apocalyptic movie. The soldiers were all trained soldiers.

His wife, who is badly infected, is the one who is ok!?! You really have to scratch your head with this one.
One little bit of dust gets in the house and suddenly Brad's home is the most problematic home in Los Angeles!

I'm going to stop here. I almost never sell movies. I'm going to sell this one for whatever I can get.",1512518400,2,2611,4.29938900203666

8232920,3,B000YIGNCW,"Boring, slow, largely uneventful - but it certainly had an unexpected twist at the end.

Run of the mill - D rated SHTF flick. The beginning starts out promising... some unknown terrorist attack. Things develop a bit and then it just hits snoozeville. Low budget.. only 4 or 5 actors in the entire film.

If you like the genre like I do, it's probably worth the $2 to kickback with your six pack.",1498435200,,396,4.410958904109589

I disliked her as soon as she broke the glass it should her selfish nature right there and then. Then to top it off the military Could not explain what they were doing at the end nor allow good byes then to kill some one in that manor was so cold blooded and unemotional .. I wish I never wasted my time and watched it ..",1498176000,,432,3.865168539325843
