8086920,4,B000BI5MEU,"This is an excellent video and although you can't learn everything from a video it's nice to see Grandmaster Shinpo Matayoshi, and the future head of Gojuryu Grandmaster Morio Higaonna do there thing. If you like this style of kobudo you can train with anyone from MATAYOSHI KOBUDO KODOKAN USA (MKKU)Headed by James Hawkes, Sensei. This video is worth seeing for anyone learning Matayoshi Kubudo.",1251072000,,396,5.107692307692307
8086921,5,B000BI5MEU,"Dragon Associates & Tsunami Productions simply offer the best professional grade martial arts instructionals in the English language.  This performance by Matayoshi Shinpo is no exception!  In addition to a total of 6 Kobudo Kata, Matayoshi Sensei demonstrates two Hakutsuru (white crane) kata learned from his father Matayoshi Shinko, who in turn learned them directly from Go Ken Ki, the Chinese tea merchant and White Crane Teacher who lived on Okinawa before WWII.

The scenery is beautiful, many scenes (both Hakutsuru and the Eku [Oar] kata) using the Ocean as a backdrop.  All kata are shown from different angles, in demonstration and then in teaching.  Likewise, bunkai (applications) of kata are shown as well, with noted Goju Ryu teacher Morio Higaonna serving as the uke (assistant).  I found this method more stimulating and less repetitive...David Chambers narrates clearly, and where there is music, it is not distracting.

This production opens with a demonstration of the first Hakutsuru Kata, and then moves to the Bo (long staff), for which 3 Kata are shown:  Choun no Kun, Sakugawa no Kun, and Suishi no Kun.  Matayoshi Tonfa follows, then Matayoshi Nunchaku, and an impressive rendition of Tsuken Akachu no Eku Kata done on a sandy beach, showing the practical purpose of tactics utilizing sand...the details of this specific form would have been completely lost with only a studio demonstration.

Most forms are taught in studio, with a black backdrop which makes it easier to focus on the subject.  Matayoshi is clear about little nuances often forgotten, a twist of the wrist here, a stamp or turn of the ankle there.  This first volume closes out with a demonstration of a second Hakutsuru kata, which is simililar but not identical to the one shown in this film's opening.  Please note that it is difficult to learn from a dvd with no prior experience.  Those with some kobudo experience, or individuals looking for an informative survey will not be disappointed.  Tsunami DVD's are higher priced than many other instructinals, but from my experience I can confirm as the old saying goes: higher priced, but worth every penny!",1161561600,2,2152,5.073863636363637
