7981624,2,B00008DDSR,I  usually like bad scary movies (I'm weird like that) but this didn't quite cut it. Save you money for a different movie.,1357430400,,122,4.304347826086956
7981625,1,B00008DDSR,"I love anthology horror and I'm a big fan of Randal Malone; I also wanted to like this movie but I couldn't. Cinematography, set pieces, dialogue and even story choices were all out-to-lunch. I'm pretty sure this is the same director of Hollywood Mortuary, which I loved, and I'm sure that with some control and willpower this could be remade into a workable and enjoyable B-Horror romp. The movie felt like being in a car after the driver had a seizure and you could see the brick wall straight ahead. Some people would complain about bad acting but I don't expect Shakespeare in low budget; what I do expect in a coherent, cohesive and copprehensive presentation. Okay, so you're thinking why'd I give it one star or even bother to write this critique? Randal Malone's hammy Italian mobster, while it didn't save the movie, gave me great amusement. Better luck next time, guys, and hopefully a bigger budget. Here's seeing ya at the movies!",1349568000,,942,4.75
7981626,1,B00008DDSR,"This film is the litmus test for all bad movies in my collection.  When I see something really awful, I can say, yeah that was a bad movie, but it was no Dead Time Tales!  Bad directing, bad acting, bad cinematogrophy, bad scripting, 10 dollar special effects budget, this film has it all!  It sounds like it would be so bad it's funny, but they manage to screw that up as well.

Here is a tip from me, get some friends in a room and play this movie.  Warn them ahead of time to avoid lawsuits later.  Watch them react to the movie.  It's hysterical!!!  Sheild your own eyes and ears from the movie for the sake of your own sanity.  No one should ever view this film more than once.  Be aware that I have lost friends with doing this, so continue at your own risk.",1156550400,2,764,4.136054421768708
