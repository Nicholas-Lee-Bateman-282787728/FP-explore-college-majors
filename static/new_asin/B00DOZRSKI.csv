5839523,5,B00DOZRSKI,Perfect DVD for 2 year olds.  Wibbly is a delight and our granddaughter laughs out loud at his adventures. We also purchased a plush Wibbly Pig that she loves.,1419465600,,159,4.482758620689655

5839525,5,B00DOZRSKI,"We had to upgrade our DVR so we lost all of our recordings. Wouldn't you know, Wibbly Pig no longer airs so I could not replace the recordings? My 3 year old was not happy. Luckily, we have Amazon Prime so him and I picked out this DVD and had it shipped. This volum has a good amount of episodes which the kiddo was satisfied with. He likes Wibbly and his catchy songs and mommy likes being able to play the DVD out in the playroom so she can have the main TV for once.",1410825600,,470,3.957894736842105

5839527,1,B00DOZRSKI,"Wow...sorry Mike Inkpen...after falling in love with Kipper (which our children can't stop quoting and now speak with a British accent), Wibbly Pig was a complete loss for their interest.  This is hardly interesting and I couldn't stop yawning trying to monitor it with my kids for their first few viewings.  Also, at least one brief really scary part that I wouldn't subject my little ones to again (a shadowy, threatening, demonic dragon that a few seconds later is presented as really cute and docile...nevertheless, the lead up was frightening).",1410307200,,549,5.088888888888889

8595627,5,B00DOZRSKI,"My husband and I both love watching Wibbly with our son.  At just-turned-9 he thought he'd outgrown it (much to our dismay), but asked for it again one day, out of the blue.  We still love it and plan on seeing more episodes.",1487376000,,225,4.209302325581396

8595635,4,B00DOZRSKI,"My toddler is a huge Wibbly Pig fan. I am thankful that this DVD was released so we can watch these fun (and thankfully) short episodes on road trips in the car. The cartoon itself is wonderful, each episode runs less than 20 minutes, so it's not a huge drain on your time. Since the episodes air sporadically on Sprout TV, this is a nice back-up.",1428364800,,347,4.2727272727272725
