8572419,3,B00BQ42Q1U,"Was somewhat disappointed. Much of cartoons are Superfriends. I assume there wasn't a popular Superman solo TV show to choose from. Most of cartoons have subpar animation, because technology wasn't like today. These are old cartoons from 25 years ago.",1475539200,,251,5.3

8572423,1,B00BQ42Q1U,"I guess I came into this with very high expectations after the excellent Best of Batman DVD release, but sadly this was greatly disappointing.
Whereas Batman's ""best of"" sourced episodes primarily from Bruce Timm's run on the character throughout the nineties and 00s, this one only features the three-episode ""Superman: The Animated Series"" and two episodes of ""Justice League Unlimited"". Which may not be a bad thing, after all, other Superman series had good runs, such as the Max Fleischer series of theatrical shorts, the 1960s ""The New Adventures of Superman"" series and the 1988 Ruby-Spears cartoon simply titled ""Superman"". Sadly, only one Fleischer short was included, only one short (less than 15 minutes) segment of ""The New Adventures of Superman"" was used, and nothing was included from the Ruby-Spears series.
Instead, the primary ""meat"" of this DVD is Super Friends, and about half the Super Friends episodes featured on this DVD set do not even feature Superman in the spotlight. In fact, some do not feature him at all. Given that over half the set's content is Super Friends, it leaves us with a depressingly Superman-free ""Best of Superman"".

There are so many good Superman cartoon episodes out there, including the ""Justice League"" two-parter titled ""Hereafter"", that to call this not-even-all-that-Superman-heavy DVD set a ""Best Of Superman"" is insulting.
All in all, save your money, buy the ""Best of Batman"" DVD set instead, or better yet, use the money you saved by not buying this to save towards purchasing a Superman: The Animated Series boxset, a Justice League boxset or a Max Fleischer's Superman boxed set.",1375315200,8,1638,5.134831460674158
8572424,5,B00BQ42Q1U,"I like all of the episodes that was on the DVD, wish it was more of some of the old episodes of superman from the 60s and the 70s.",1374796800,,130,3.5172413793103448
8572425,1,B00BQ42Q1U,No audio on over half of the discs.  Very odd and disappointing.  Don't understand why.  Never had this problem with any other DVD or Blu-ray.,1374364800,,142,4.6
8572426,4,B00BQ42Q1U,More team stories here than Superman solo.  All shows are represented from the 40s to the 2000s.  Nice way to get a sampling without having to buy all the shows separately.,1373587200,2,172,4.516129032258065
8572427,4,B00BQ42Q1U,This is a great sampling of Superman animation from the 40s to to 90s and is a fun overview of the various versions of the character.  A fun package.,1372636800,,149,4.137931034482759
