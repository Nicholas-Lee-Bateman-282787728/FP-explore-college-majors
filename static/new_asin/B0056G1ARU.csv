4588381,5,B0056G1ARU,"This series is one of the finest treatments of Western Art and Art History that is available in multimedia.  It is a series that appeals to both experienced art historians, and, persons who want an introduction to art history.

This second episode focuses on the cathedrals and churches constructed in Europe from the tenth century (Romanesque period) to the High Gothic period.  It shows how the Middle Age architects used the Roman principles of architecture and engineering, and how they refined Roman building techniques, to create the extraordinary cathedrals and churches of the Middle Ages.  This episode not only focuses on the cathedrals of France and Spain, but, also on the Norman spread of Romanesque architecture to England.  In appreciating this episode, it helps to have viewed the first episode in the series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Classical-Ideal/dp/B007NEZBC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Classical Ideal</a>, but, it is not necessary to view the first episode in order to appreciate this one.
.
The episode focuses on the development of the High Gothic cathedrals in Chartres and St. Deny (in France) and the perfection of the High Gothic cathedrals in England after the Norman conquest.

The series then continues, in the next episode, to show the extraordinary contributions that Italian artists made to art and architecture during the Early Renaissance period.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Early-Renaissance/dp/B007NF0SKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Early Renaissance</a>

I really enjoyed watching this series.  I own the DVD set, but, found that Amazon's digital download provides better resolution for HD tv's than a progressive scan image from the 1989 DVD set.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Art-of-the-Western-World/dp/B0056G1ARU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Art of the Western World</a>

Michael Wood (see below) has taken a unique approach to art history in this program.  Instead of telling a story of art with arcane analysis, he presents a series of presentations by art experts that explain Western Art, from the Greeks to present day, in the context of the historical realities in which the Art developed.

This series follows a companion book of the same title (although the book is not necessary for viewing the DVD).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ART-OF-THE-WESTERN-WORLD-From-Ancient-Greece-to-Post-Modernism/dp/B000X6OPX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ART OF THE WESTERN WORLD From Ancient Greece to Post Modernism</a>

I highly recommend this series as an excellent overview of Art History in the West that allows us to understand, not only Art, but, its origins.

For those of us who have viewed Michael Wood's documentaries, he needs no introduction. For those of us who haven't, here is a brief summary: Wood has produced over 100 documentaries in this thirty year career as a journalist, scholar and broadcaster. Each of them brings history alive. Much of his focus, in his documentaries, is on dispelling myths and misconceptions about history. His documentaries are scholarly, yet fascinating to even the average viewer. He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, the Royal Society of Arts and the Society of Antiquaries. He is a governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company and a Pro- Chancellor of the University of Staffordshire.

Trivia: Wood's charismatic presence on the screen and his looks are appealing especially to women. He was humorously dubbed ""the thinking woman's crumpet"" by British newspapers.",1350691200,13,3656,6.143137254901961
4588382,2,B0056G1ARU,"It's listed as ""A sweeping overview of western painting, sculpture, and architecture."" Sweeping is the optimal word. Woods doesen't really go into much detail about the art or the artist. Just a romp through history with a few pictures. If you want more than just an overview (and this is not a very good one), sweep this one aside and pick-up ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" or ""The Power of Art""",1327622400,10,395,4.577464788732394
4588383,5,B0056G1ARU,"Exceptional production, Great Host and great writing.  Even prior to taking my first college history course on art, I had already viewed this exceptional work on PBS.  Michael Wood is the perfect host and you can feel his enthusiasm while transported to each time period.
Wonderful commentary by leading art historians also add to the production.

I was very pleased this was made available on DVD.  It has been freely available as a low resolution broadcast on the internet but it's nice to see the full glory of the new digital transfer.  It may look dated due to the use of film initially,but it was an exceptional production.",1324252800,35,629,4.787037037037037
4588384,5,B0056G1ARU,"Western Art 101. Beginning Art Appreciation, yet some details to interest even the aesthetically enlightened. Not conclusive, but an authoritative look worthy of university credit. 9 SUBTITLED episodes presented by art historian, Michael Wood. Many other art scholars are included as the viewer is carried into a film (not stills) of architecture and art pieces from Greece to yesterday's newest art encounter. Wood keeps the presentation at a vocabulary level suitable for most high-school age and above. Recommended for any art major/minor, or anyone taking an appreciation class, and of course art lovers.

Immediately this DVD set brought back my own personal art history experience of 1960s undergraduate art major days. I discovered this series is closely related to a text ""History of Art"" by H. W. Janson. That university art history text has been preserved by me now for 43 years and was consulted while viewing this DVD set. A Coordinating Producer for the ""Art of the Western World"" PBS documentary was Gail Janson. I suspect a connection, book-series. Film is an enhanced way to see a sculpture (all sides), painting (zoom), or architecture (interior and out)-- betters textbook photos.

Episodes are each almost an hour, SUBTITLED, and follow Parts and Chapters of the mentioned ""History of Art"" text. Text locations indicated in ( ).
1: The Classical Ideal
Greek & Roman impact on the world to follow. (Part 1 Chap. 5,7)
2 A white Garment of Churches: Romanesque and Gothic Art
Pilgrimage, cathedrals & monks manuscripts to Gothic flying buttresses & pointed arches. (Pt 2 Ch 3-4)
3 The Early Renaissance
Florence to Flemish oils (Pt 3 Ch 2)
4 The High Renaissance
Papal patronage & Venice; Leonardo & Michelangelo (Pt 3 Ch 3)
5 Realms of Light: the Baroque
First in Rome, then Austria & Germany; church & royalty; Rubens to Rembrandt (Pt 3 Ch 6-8)
6 An Age of Reason, an Age of Passion
Picturesque landscape & architecture; Rococo; neoclassicism; Romanticism (Pt 4 Ch 1)
7 A Fresh View: Impressionism and Postimpressionism
Manet Monet Degas Renoir, Van Gogh ...  (Pt 4 Ch 2-3)
8 Into the 20th Century
Klimt Matisse Picasso Mondrian Frank Lloyd Wright...  (Pt 4 Ch 4-5)
9 In Our Own Time
Post-modern Pollock to Warhol to women (text was prior to this time)

Bonus: viewers guide with more interesting information, related to but not repeating the DVDs
Text bios of Michael Wood and major artists; disc 1 Kritias & Nesiotes, Gislebertus, Filippo Brunelleschi, Jan van Eyck; disc 2 Leonardo, Andrea Palladio, Caravaggio, Jacques-Louis David; disc 3 Manet, Picasso, Corbusier, Pollock.

I strongly recommend this to the visual art enthusiast, educator, student, and patron. Regardless of prior knowledge, you will be enlightened, entertained, and enraptured with this intellectual collection. Also take a look at another fantastic art DVD set ""Every Picture Tells A Story"".
Consider H.W. Janson's ""History of Art"" text to read while watching PBS's ""Art of the Western World.""",1313884800,103,2986,5.121149897330596

4588407,5,B0056G1ARU,The most important dvd collection I own. Once upon a time you could only buy this collection through the Annenberg /CPB website for educational purposes if you were a teacher. The price was $300 for it. But it finally was released and thank goodness I didn't buy it for that price. But I almost did. As an artist this is a must in my collection.

4588416,4,B0056G1ARU,This was a good series of artwork and their artists.  My biggest complaint is that it is very dated and not in HD.,1400544000,,114,3.9565217391304346
4588417,3,B0056G1ARU,"When it came out this was a brilliant general introduction to western art but it is not aging particularly well. If it was reshot using modern equipment, so the display is not small and grainy it would be a four or five star video.

The choice of material is great and Michael Wood is interesting throughout. While there is a lot of variability between the nine episodes, in general the comments of the guest speakers are thoughtful and not too dull. Through the monologs, the viewers learn about the political/religious issues of the times while seeing some of the most famous works of art in the western world. The art is introduced with some reference to events of the times but the viewer who is missing a background in history may get lost to the importance of cultural figures (especially the artists' patrons). On the other hand there is enough to hold the narrative together and this does set the stage for people who want to learn more.

Obviously with only nine hours to work with there is a lot of room to complain about missing works but in general this is an excellent skeleton for a viewer who wants to start to learn about the history of western art. One can only hope that it gets reshot in higher resolution (and without the oh so dated fashions).",1399766400,,1264,4.5394736842105265

The program does an excellent job of relating how art from the past influences art that is new.  The influence of the Greeks and Romans on the Renaissance up to today's modern art was well presented and defined.  There is a lot to cover when you are presenting over 2000 years of art but I think this program does a decent job emphasizing the key periods.  I would rank the 9 hours of this programing to be a great introduction to art history of the western world.

4588445,3,B0056G1ARU,"I have to give this survey mixed reviews because it is so uneven. Each of the nine 55 minute episodes (from the Greeks through Contemporary art) is written and directed by someone different.

Moreover, even though historian Michael Wood narrates all nine, each episode gives considerable time to individual art historians of particular periods and artists. So, for example, in episode 7, ""Impressionism and Postimpressionism"", one art historian gives a wonderfully accessible yet deeply informed commentary on Courbet, Manet and the Impressionists. And then another art historian takes over for the Postimpressionists, and gives a less accessible art jargon filled commentary.

In addition, some episodes try to cover too much and therefore move quickly, while others such as the one on the Baroque, the focus is kept on seven artists: Pietro di Cortona, Borromini, Bernini, Caravaggio, Velazquez, Rubens and Rembrandt, giving lots of screen time to the paintings themselves, something I really appreciated.

And finally, the production values seem really dated, even though it is from the late 1980s. The production notes say they filmed in 150 locations in eight countries, at considerable cost. And yet that is woven with other grainy stock footage of scenery.

All in all, though, it was worth watching, and the price is reasonable.",1351382400,43,1336,5.37799043062201

8459580,5,B0056G1ARU,"This DVD is a classic for teaching any subject on the history and development of  ""Western Art.""  It is comprehensive, well done, well received and a fabulous visual follow-up series for all teachers of this important subject, whether it be undergraduate or graduate level courses in college or university art history.  I highly recommend using this audio visual aid whether in the classroom or on-line. After very thorough discussion of each subject in the book by the same title or even another related text, it illustrates exactly what the class has been discussing.  It is the best I have found to do this for the teacher and student.
