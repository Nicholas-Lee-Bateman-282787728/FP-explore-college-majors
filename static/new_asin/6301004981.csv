305766,3,6301004981,"May Britt, whose greatest claim to fame may have been her marriage to Sammy Davis, Jr., plays Ingrid, a deeply religious woman.  Someone molested Ingrid as a child.  A series of attacks by a scissors-wielding person seems to be making Ingrid relive the molestation in her mind.  Ingrid is also in fear of someone raping her.  While the scissors-wielding person is one of the people she fears, it seems she is worried about most men, except her uncle.  I will discuss Ingrid's Uncle a bit more in a moment.

We do see a murder by the scissor-wielding maniac at the beginning of the movie that sets the tone for Ingrid's fears.

Frankie, who works at the local meat market, attacks Ingrid twice.  One of the things that bothered me was that Frankie's attacks on Ingrid seemed different to me from the attacks on other people.  Then there was the stranger in town.  Strangers are always easy to blame for attacks.  However, in most modern thrillers the designated stranger is usually there to provide distraction from the real killer.

The one person in this movie, besides Ingrid, who is strange is Ingrid's uncle.  He seems to appear and disappear with regularity.  While I had Ingrid's uncle pegged as a possible attacker, when Frankie attacks Ingrid I got confused.  Fortunately, Uncle Carl, played by veteran actor Cameron Mitchell, provides some answers in the final scene of the movie, so things do get a bit more clear at the end.

Though this movie focuses too much on Ingrid's flashbacks and Ingrid's concerns about a possible attack until something actually happens, as the movie nears the end things heat up dramatically.  A shower scene near the end of this movie gave me flashbacks of the shower scene in the Alfred Hitchcock's version of ""Psycho.""  Things happen quite quickly in the last fifteen minutes of the movie and a lot is crammed in, so you have to watch closely to understand, or at least, be prepared to understand, what is happening.  Even watching closely I was a little confused until the very end.  Some surreal moments near the end added to my confusion.  The surreal moments were likely deliberate to keep the end as much of a surprise as possible.

While this movie is not one of those you put on your ""must watch"" or ""must have"" list, it is worth a watch for the surprise ending.  Some viewers may guess certain aspects of the ending, but guessing and seeing are two different things.  I was moderately surprised at part of the ending and I did enjoy watching this movie, but I doubt I will watch this movie again.

Picture Quality:  Mostly acceptable, but some of the scenes were too dark.  I am unsure of whether the dark scenes were that way when filmed or whether the film had degraded.

Sound Quality:  Average for a movie in the public domain.

Good luck!",1303171200,2,2792,4.673511293634497

What do you get when you take one part ""Repulsion"", one part ""Homicidal"" and one part ""Sheriff Lobo""? The answer is ""Haunts"", an unassuming '70s thriller no one has heard of but one that can pass 90 minutes with little discomfort.

May Britt (who IS she?) is a Scandinavian farm woman who looks like Jean Arliss from William Castle's ""Homicidal"". In one scene, much to my delight, she even smashes a picture frame with the same demented frustration as Arliss did in ""Homicidal""'s flower shop scene.

We learn from the start she's a little off-balanced because she has dreamy childhood flashbacks involving attempted molestation (as she's milking her goat!).

What's upsetting her even more is that a scissor-wielding maniac is stalking and killing the women in her rural community.

It's clear that May is frigid and uncomfortable around men due to her past. She is repulsed by the butcher, with whom the town tramp Nell flirts shamelessly. (Nell's big scene at the local watering hole as she switches back and forth between lonely drunk and big-mouthed bitch were the comic highlight of the film.) May also rebuffs the advances of the new guy in the church choir.

As the movie progresses, May is raped by the butcher, not once, but twice, and I had to keep guessing to figure out where all this was going.

I assumed there was going to be some sort of lesbian revelation, or that her strange uncle (Cameron Mitchell) was somehow responsible.

3/4 through, there is a police chase in a sawmill which I thought would produce some serious gore, but it did not deliver.

Needless to say, things got a little muddled towards the end but it did make for anything but a routine who-dun-it.

While most people would be disappointed by the slow pacing and lack of gore, I rather enjoy this type of film much more than the big-budget CGI, MTV-style edited garbage of today.

FYI I got my copy in a budget-priced box set called ""50 Chilling Classics"".",1293062400,,1987,4.747093023255814

305771,3,6301004981,"Ingrid (May Britt) lives on a farm with her uncle Carl (Cameron ""The Demon"" Mitchell), spending her days milking a goat and having disturbing flashbacks about her childhood traumas. Meanwhile, a scissor-wielding maniac is killing women around town. There are several suspects for the sheriff (Aldo Ray) to be wary of. There's Frankie, the young, smarmy playboy who chops meat at the butchershop. Then, there's the stranger who just arrived in town. And we also have uncle Carl to wonder about. Ingrid seems semi-normal, but she starts to unravel as the story progresses. Has she really been attacked by the madman? Twice?? What about her hallucinations about blood? Is she just cracking up? HAUNTS is an average little thriller / chiller with some above average asperations. The characters are genuine and even endearing, in a Mayberry sort of way. I especially liked Ingrid and the sheriff. However, a lot of what is supposed to be mysterious and scary comes across as confusing and rather dull. I still recommend it for a night of 70s cheese...",1127952000,3,1046,4.982857142857143
7809013,4,6301004981,"I watched this film just last night and was very impressed by the plot and by the natural feel of the acting. In fact, I think the plot works much better in these post-David Lynch days, because audiences may not be so demanding that everything is so clearly spelled out for them. Once I saw the ending, I wanted to watch it again to see if I could tell which of my various theories was correct. I think this deserves a solid release through Scream Factory or some other specialty blu-ray company for genre buffs.",1511049600,,512,4.4
7809014,1,6301004981,"Agree with everyone on this topic, movie was complete waste of time. The location they filmed it in is rather a nice area, i enjoyed that.",1498435200,,138,4.346153846153846
7809015,3,6301004981,"I was mainly interested in this film for its location being Mendocino County in the early/mid 1970s. It's a strange little film, definitely dated, and the video quality is pretty washed-out and degraded in places, although the audio is strong and fine. I ended up confused by the plot line and what was what, but I enjoyed some of the film's cheesier moments, like a bizarre scene where the rapist-killer tackles a victim in full view of a cop who'd pulled a sports car over, the cop leaves his ticket book on the sports car to help the rape victim, and the sports car driver takes the ticket book, rips up his (presumably speeding) ticket, throws the ticket book, and drives off. There are some interesting little details like that in this film. There's a Nick Nolte-esque, alkie sheriff who throws up in a toilet that has -- get this (I remember these things from the 70s) -- a fantastically ugly dark green warmer/carpet on the toilet seat. It's also interesting to note that this film has a goat-milking scene where blood gets in the milk, which was used in a very effective and creepy manner in the recent film The VVitch. (sorry for these spoilers!) But overall this is a pretty uninspired slasher flick. I was drawn in by, as I said, the Mendocino background and reading about how the main character has these weird flashbacks while milking her goat, but that's not enough to make a movie good. It's interesting if you are a cinephile or like so-bad-they're-good-movies, but apart from that this a slow, cheesy film pulled from a very worn and faded print. Up to you whether you wanna invest in this film or not.",1462492800,,1619,4.6055363321799305

Adding more after just spoiled it. I guess it also didn't help that after I found out who the killer was I truly lost interest. Maybe if it was done in a better way it could've worked out, Maybe if the killer wasn't revealed that soon the last bit wouldn't have felt like extra stuff added on just to add time to the movie, Hmmm.....

7809020,2,6301004981,"""Haunts"" was shot amid the scenic beauty of Northern California's Mendocino Coastline in 1974 under the title ""The Deadly Veil"".  Soon after its 1977 release it was featured as the ""Dog of the Week"" on Gene Siskel's and Roger Ebert's network TV program ""At The Movies"".

They highlighted a scene in which Aldo Ray (as the Sheriff) is drinking a glass of milk (something which must've been quite difficult for him unless it was laced).  In each scene the levels of milk in the glass seemed to indiscriminately rise and fall.  This probably made self respecting continuity folks go ape.

I was 23 years old when I appeared in this film as Tony the bartender sharing scenes with the great Susan Nohr as Nell.  In some ways the story was ahead of its time.  Unfortunately, the rough production values and some of the acting (it was a very low budget film even for the 70's) did not help it find an audience.  However, I still enjoy watching it every once in a while if only to see and remember what it was like to have a 28 inch waistline!!!

7809021,2,6301004981,"This film from a 50 pack of chillers was very confusing to me and I felt disgusted and let down at the end for that reason.  What really happened to Ingrid as a child?  Is her uncle`s account really reliable? The flashbacks gave very little to go on.  Was the drifter the killer or was it Ingrid`s uncle?  Jump to Ingrid`s funeral without any preparation or explanation and why is her image in the mirror behind  her uncle if she is indeed dead?  A who done it that`s not worth a second viewing to figure out, if indeed it can be figured out. The picture was somewhat blurred with occasional blips but better than a lot of budget releases.",1369008000,,639,4.3277310924369745
7809022,2,6301004981,Mildly entertaining 1970's drive in schlock about a scissor wielding killer terrorizing a small farm community.  The lead character is a Swedish spinster with issues (constant flashbacks to her childhood suggest this even though the flashbacks themselves don't show anything particularly disturbing) whose sewing scissors disappear around the time the murders start.  Is she the killer or a potential victim?  Since this is a pre-slasher horror film the violence is pretty mild.  Haunts isn't particularly suspenseful but it's a decent enough time-waster if you like 70's B movies.  Then there's the transfer.  This looks pretty much like a VHS tape.  The bright scenes are watchable enough but the dark scenes are frequently so washed out that you can barely see anything at all.  Keep your expectations very low if you decide to watch this one.,1361491200,2,846,5.214814814814815
