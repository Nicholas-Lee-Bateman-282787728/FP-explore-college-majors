8423418,4,B004CQZF9Y,"Bill Moyers is one of my favorite journalists and he does an excellent job here with all his interviews and insights.  The only drawback to this series is that it was filmed in 1987 and is now quite outdated.  However, despite it's age, he does ask some timeless questions about how the Constitution and the U.S. government work together and the interviews with politicians, lawyers, and Supreme Court justices are fascinating.  Watching the series made me aware, for the first time, of how unique the American system truly is, in comparison to the governments and laws of other nations.  I would recommend this series to anyone who is interested in learning more about the Constitution and how it affects our daily lives.",1424304000,2,722,4.89344262295082
8423419,5,B004CQZF9Y,"These Are the Rich People Who Want To Establish A New World Order. The first thing to go will be the US Constitution as Canada, Mexico, and the US form a new government if they get a chance to do it. They must be stopped before the Bushes and others try to establish a dictatorship in North America.
Bill Moyers has picked a good group of experts who explain why we need to keep our constitution and not accept lies from future leaders who want to establish a dictatorship to replace our democracy. Highly recommended.",1388361600,4,518,4.463157894736842
8423420,5,B004CQZF9Y,"More facts were gleaned from this DVD set than was learned about the constitution over my 17 years of formal schooling. Bill Moyers was a master at interview and digs deep into the minds of scholars, politicians, justices, and citizens to find the story of the constitution's worth on the 200th anniversary, 1987. James Madison is considered by most to be the primary writer of the Constitution. 11 episodes enlighten and teach about how the Constitution is working for modern America. This set is historic footage in the light of 21st century Supreme Court decisions as well as the documentation of thoughts of past Justices now retired and/or deceased.

Episodes are approximately 60 minutes each.
SUBTITLES are provided.

An extremely entertaining, educational, and worthy set to own. Every American would benefit from seeing this. Every HS through University library should hold a copy, as well as public libraries. And perhaps work programs for the public's education around some of the episodes. The vocabulary and material is at a level most young adult and older will find appropriate.

Bonus includes text updates on each of the 4 discs for participants and/or issues covered on the disc. There is a Moyers text bio. An excellent Athena produced 13-page booklet adds episode discussion questions, a well explained glossary of today's Constitution buzzwords, and 3 more Constitution related articles.

One of the best Emmy winning Bill Moyers sets from PBS released by Athena yet.",1293753600,8,4032,5.588524590163934
