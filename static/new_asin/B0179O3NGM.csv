8738438,3,B0179O3NGM,"The region 4 DVD is rated M by the Australian Government, but really this is like watching a G made for captive school kid audience. There's a little bit of language in it, but really other than that it's a made for kid level cyber stalker movie. It's marketed as a thriller where a Saw type villain decides to teach an online bully (Maisie Williams) a lesson.  But really it's so mild that there's no reason you'd be concerned for Maisie's or any other character's safety.  The whole threat from the hacker character is he's going to release five photos of her topless that she sent to her boyfriend, these photos look pretty mild to me, although she'd obviously care, it seems a bit unlikely she'd do what he wants her to towards the end of the movie, just to stop them being published.

The movie only goes for an hour, it's obviously made for, or at least wanting to be picked up by the UK (and possibly other country's) school curriculum as an education resource.  Someone has gone, you know we need to get a popular face that kids love to play our main character.  Hey Game of Thrones is really popular, why don't we get Maisie Williams to play her, kids will be really into this.  They won't be, although William's performance is pretty good she has a very lame and limited script to perform from.  Her foe is someone talking like K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider.

The film seems to be more about being a class discussion point once it's over for what Maisie's character did wrong to become the target of the vigilante for online victims, as she did stuff that as she points out, most teenagers do. She also blames the victims for making themselves a target. Obviously the goal of this is to make them aware of the consequences to the victim being trolled.  Which is obviously a serious message.  But for a movie, it was very predictable where it was going with the bad singer element and other parts.  The movie just ends once this lesson is out there for the classroom audience, if it was a real thriller we'd have found out the motivation for the vigilante, we'd likely see them caught or at least someone try to, we'd at least see events play out with her father.  We don't even see that actor as they obviously don't want any adult actor to change the focus from Maisie.  I also found it unrealistic that he wouldn't come to her room, she is shouting at the vigilante and is clearly distressed, what kind of father wouldn't come into the room no matter how much she tells him to stay out?

There's plenty of cyber victim, cyber stalker movies out there.  Even a lot of low budget made for TV movies are better thrillers than this one.  Unless you really a big fan of Maisie Williams, I'd give this one a miss.  It also has in a very minor role Ellla Purnell (Emma from Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Mackenzie from Wildlike).",1490572800,,2846,4.463320463320463
8738439,1,B0179O3NGM,The DVD was bad. Sound would go in and out the whole time. The picture would skip start and stop the whole movie. It was not my DVD player. I put in a different non-usa DVD disk and it worked fine.,1486425600,,197,3.8292682926829267
