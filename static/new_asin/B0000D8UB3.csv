8423421,1,B0000D8UB3,"I tap danced when I was younger, (I am 22 now) and have recently decided I wanted to get back into dance so I purchased this tape as a refresher course. As soon as I turned it on I realized this tape was not what I expected. I don't feel that the instructor explains the steps enough, she performs them but gives you no direction as to how to do them. In looking at the DVD cover and this performers website ([...]) it looks extremely unprofessional and this look comes across in the DVD also. The performer is standing on a small piece of tapping floor and is definitly not in a studio. The price for this DVD is outrageous and I was expecting much more out of it. I gave it about 10 minutes of play time but couldn't bear to go on from there.",1126051200,6,744,4.102739726027397
8423422,4,B0000D8UB3,"I recommend this product to both first time tap dancers and tap dancers wanting to refresh or continue learning more advanced steps. Ginger goes through each lesson step by step, then with counts, and then once more with music....all of which are very helpful in learning the timing and feel of the moves once the move is learned.

The only thing preventing me from rating this product with 5 stars, is the fact that when she is instructing the Shim Sham (Part 1) she says ""shuffle, step, step"" but when she performs the move with music she actually does ""shuffle, ball change"", which are very different actions. So there are times when she is inconsistant with what she says and what she actually does.

I think the Zoot CD is a nice added bonus, if you like jazz style music, because it makes you want to get up and dance!",1121817600,3,824,4.486666666666666
8423423,5,B0000D8UB3,"I didn't start tap class until pretty late in life and discovered everyone was better than me even though it was beginners' level. I decided the only way to keep up was by practicing on my own and tried a number of different tapes and DVDs until I discovered this one. It was absolutely sensational. It moves at a clear, even pace with the teacher showing you absolutely everything you need to know and repeating it carefully until you get it (although of course you can always replay any parts that need special work) and I discovered that  now I can not only keep up with the rest of my classmates but I'm even getting better than some of them!

Tap with Ginger. Golden Treasures. 2003. 4hr. DVD $44.95
A competent tap dance teacher shows wannabes various dance steps while voice over narration (spoken in a slight European accent) explains techniques and movements. The instructor stands on a raised dance floor, initially facing viewers before turning her back so the camera can record her foot movements. The steps are repeated four times and the beat is counted out. Music accompanies the fourth repeat. Viewers can choose beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels with 15 steps included in each. Shuffles, flaps, slides, paddle rolls, trills, rolling steps, riffs, and pull-backs are among the demonstrated steps. The DVD also features a tap dance dictionary and review lessons. This no frills, well-executed instructional is suggested for dancers at all levels. --Nancy McCray",1073520000,19,934,5.493055555555555
