8425865,5,B004DPTK8G,"Fair warning for hardcore Fireheads like myself... this book/DVD is absolutely essential to your happiness. BUT be prepared, it will alter your perception of the FST dramatically. Specifically, it will make you want to steal Phil Proctor's microphone forever and hide it somewhere very far away.

As we all know Phil is responsible for many of the very finest and funniest Firesign moments... we needn't go into them here. BUT for some reason, Phil on the radio show is grimly, horribly determined to drive the show into the ditch every time he gets the microphone. He reads boring stories from the paper, he tells pointless tales on and on endlessly, he tells us crash scene reports, war atrocity reports and news reports (Did you know Tiny Tim's wife had a miscarriage?) and is just generally not ever in sync with the rest of the troupe when they get close to the edge. Pete and Phil (Austin) will be riffing away like nobody's business and Phil will stop them dead in their tracks to read something from an old Life magazine. It happens over and over and OVER until you wonder why they didn't stop him!

If you listen closely, Austin and Bergman often make fun of Proctor by snoring while he's talking, but maddeningly, he never takes the hint. If it's interesting to him, he thinks it must be interesting to us.

Ossman is almost as bad, with his incessant reading of things that are simply not funny and only borderline interesting. Yes David, the Indians, we know, we know. Guess what, you're famous for being a COMEDY group.

But Bergman. And Austin. Oh my God, they are funnier than you even thought they were. They riff off each other like, well, like the Firesign Theatre. They make the show worth listening to almost every time.",1389052800,3,1740,4.676470588235294
8425866,4,B004DPTK8G,"Like any good box set on a single artist, it doesn't hurt to know a little about the subject before diving in. Unless you're familiar with the artist or have big ears followed by large amount of curiosity, the experience might feel similar to drowning. With this particular set, you just might need a life preserver as the back cover notes proudly boasts of its 80 hours of audio content, all loaded into its data DVD disc. This is not for the novice....or, to the point, anybody who still thinks the radio morning zoos and Carrot Top are still funny.

The comedy group of The Firesign Theatre are the ones behind all of those 80 hours hanging over your head and though all that content might sound intimidating, think of it as a comedic almost cosmic journey of four performers/writers interacting, or `riffing', with each other like a `word jazz' campfire.

If you are familiar with The Theatre, all of this comes to no surprise. The group's recorded output has always been a multi-layered hyper assault on the mainstream and the senses. Album titles like Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me The Pliers and How Can You Be In Two Places At Once When You're Not Anywhere At All are a small hints of the complex furry that is to come when the needle hits the vinyl or aluminum disc crammed into the machine. Though there's lots of improvisations and chatter in this set, the assault is still there, only more casually.

The focus here is on the groups three radio series from 1970-72 on various public radio stations in Los Angeles; 45 to 90 minute almost weekly episodes of four hyper actively creative men gathering around the microphones talking, performing and general gibberishing all over the map. Such an unstructured format can flounder a bit and hard to follow, but that's part the course with the Firesign in such an environment; four artists following wherever their jittery muse goes until the clock on the wall tell them to knock it off or one of them passes out, whichever happens first.

To go into detail of what is filled inside these radio programs is a major task all by itself. My personal favorites includes Dr. Beanbag (a fractured segment on a fractured advice doctor, a prediction of the coming of Dr. freakin' Phil) and `Hey Banana Nose!' (a diorama on growing up and the internal battle between mind, body and sexual urges grow ups tend to fight), but these are more structured material and there are far more improvised moments that are equally funny and deep. For a small highlight reel of this experience, one must also hunt down their 1971 album, `Dear Friends', which contains small cuts from their second series of the same name.

All of this blathering doesn't even address the 110 page book that houses the DVD. Much like the silver disc, the book is indeed crammed; interviews with the surviving members and staff, archival material, Phil Proctor's intense collages and detailed track listings! `Too much is always better than not enough' is the Sub-Genius phrase that I kept hearing in my head while digging through this heap, and being a fan, I can't argue against that hard fact.

There's another hard fact to conceder; the only place in today's radio realm where you can hear such unabashed creative and entertaining spirit is The Hour Of Slack and Negativland's Over The Edge and forget satellite radio. As FST member Pete Bergman addressed this issue: ""We're not crude, we're not really rude, we're not sexist or ageist or racist, really. We question authority, We bite every hand, starting with our own. And we figure that's fair. We don't take on the weak. We take on the powerful. We were unafraid to display how educated we were. It's a bit difficult to find four people who will go public about being smart and educated, and do it without feeling anyone's looking over their shoulder."" Yup, it's interesting and a bit scary how a little dose of humanity can get in the way of the bottom line.

The only minus here, aside of the intimidation factor for the newbies, is that this is a limited print run. In fact, by the time you read this, it'll be out o' print and you'll have to go through E-bay and the Amazon jungle to hunt it down and literally pay the price for coming in late. I got my copy just days after it was announced that only 100 copies were left.....and this set came out in February of this year!

The only thing left to do, outside of possibly going broke, is to contact Seeland Records (Negativland's record label) and the Theatre and demand a second printing. The bottom line to everybody who plan to get this multi-media monster and to those who already have: Good freakin' Luck, you'll need it!!",1372896000,2,4656,4.662606577344701
8425867,5,B004DPTK8G,"OK, first of all, for an old-time Firehead, having this huge collection of the radio shows on a DVD audio disc really is a decades-old dream come true... the motherlode... the Rosetta Stone... etc.  I've only begun to delve into the shows themselves; it's gonna be a lo-o-o-n-n-g strange trip (and I don't need no funny smoke for it either-- THIS stuff is the funny smoke!)

But the book that accompanies the disc is actually the main reason I'm chiming in here.  That, too, is a treasure; as someone else said here, it's worth the (original) price all by itself.  You get a detailed breakdown of all the shows.  You get interviews that illuminate the whole behind-the-scenes process of creating the programs each week. You get plenty of illustrations/scans/photos of the source material that inspired many of the ""Dear Friends"" set pieces-- for example, the actual 1918 ""Bringing Up Father"" comic strip with ""Why don't you let him enjoy the war!!""  It's the next best thing to having been there.

And-- what really pushed me to write a review-- you get Phil Proctor's weirdly hilarious collages, assembled during the Sixties from magazine ads, newspapers, old comic-book speech balloons, and so forth.  If you loved the surreal collages in the SubGenius books, you'll devour these too!  Think of them as non-sequiturs with sharp teeth. They embody Firesign's skewed outlook on modern society just as much as the records and radio shows-- tapping into the cultural unconscious to unveil the seething complexities hidden just below the tip of the iceberg that was the Officially-Approved U.S. of A.  And, as with the records, you may not be able to describe in a coherent way what he is telling you, but on some level of your brain you GET IT (or, if you're not so fortunate, you don't).  The piece that combines, among other things, a baby on a hospital bed and James Brown (!) made me laugh out loud.  So well does it convey the dark undercurrents of mid-1960s America that it ought to be blown up to poster size and displayed in the Museum of Modern Art with Andy Warhol and Salvador Dali.  In Phil's interview he explains why that will, sadly, never happen.  Put it this way:  If you've ever thought of Proctor as merely part of the ""lighter, stand-up-comedy half"" of the Firesign Theatre, his work here should help cure you of that notion.

Bottoms-out line:  If you can't get enough of prime Firesign, GET THIS PACKAGE NOW (if you still can)!",1354665600,6,2447,4.760663507109005

I made a tape copy of each for myself and have listened to them several times over the years.  Now to have fairly pristine copies of almost every syllable ever uttered as syndicated radio by the other fab four is quite a neat experience.  The book accompanying the amazing DVD audio disc is pretty cool in itself.  A lot of neat pictures and some spectacularly goofy ones too, along with commentary and history from the boys and other close Bozos makes this a darn near irresistable package.

Finally, a very satisfying Firesign Theatre product has been released, just in time for Groundhog Day. You don't have to be afraid of these (back from the) shadows, and if you are, just scurry down your hole for 80 hrs. of the 6 more ""Old Man Winter"" weeks listening to all of the `live' Firesign radio broadcasts air-checked in the early 1970s. Included are the full length shows: ""THE FIRESIGN THEATRE HOUR HOUR"" (1 - 7/70), ""DEAR FRIENDS"" (9/70 - 2/71), and ""LET'S EAT"" (11/71 - 3/72) all slightly edited with the musical interludes chucked out. As if that's not enough to chew on, the ""listener's digest"" syndicated versions of the ""DEAR FRIENDS"" and ""LET'S EAT"" shows served up to `underground' radio stations on LP and Reel To Reel tape are also on the plate.

There's even a 108 page, 7 x 10 inch menu to devour info about the salvaged material in informative and entertainingly written essays with easy to swallow interviews direct from the mouths of the participants. The book's satiated with rare photos and color artwork to flip through while you flip out, massaging your brain with the MP3-DVD ear candy.

The only downer about whole deal is that the audio can be a little hard to access. The best way to play the files, obviously, is in your computer or some DVD players. However, the individual series and shows can be downloaded into MP3 devices or burned onto `jukebox' CDs.

Firesign fans only familiar with their commercially released LPs and CDs might be a little disappointed in the lack of production values, soundscapes and developed story lines that made them famous but this soon wears off as you go with the flow.

Newbies and Old Timer Radio fans might be confused or put off a little by the Boomer stoner and non-PC humor but the infectious material crosses all lines in the sands of time and holds up in the arrested development of FM programming. They just don't make radio shows like this any more, in fact it was fairly rare at the time, as is explained in the linear liner notes. Firesign Theatre radio wasn't a series of jokes or one liners but a separate world amalgam of passed around improvisations and puns, scripted bits and pieces, poems, found and otherwise, readings set to music, and multi-layer surrealist blather. In other words, a conversational wonderland. It's 4 or 5 guys talking to and through each other that can't be explained, just listened to.",1295654400,17,2484,4.727482678983834
8425871,5,B004DPTK8G,"First off, this is not a DVD video.  This is a DVD-ROM chock full of MP3 audio files.  As such, there is no region code.  It can be played on any computer and many DVD & Blu-ray players.  This is a little odd, but stay with me; this is the best decision they could make for this release.

And, it comes with a book.  But more about the book later.

THE DVD-ROM
This one disc contains over 80 hours worth of mp3 audio files from the radio broadcasts of KPFK-FM.  If they tried to put this on CDs it would take almost 70 of them!  I don't have enough shelf space for that.  It would have cost many times current price to release it, making it unobtainable for many.  For this project, a DVD-ROM makes the most sense.

The great thing about this is that I can copy the mp3 files onto my computer & listen to them at my computer, on my iPod, at work, etc.  For those without a computer (I'm sure there are a few Fireheads out there without one at the moment), many blu-ray & DVD players will play this disc.  My Blu-Ray player, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-BDP-S470-3D-Blu-ray-Disc-Player/dp/B0036WS4CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony BDP-S470 3D Blu-ray Disc Player</a>, plays this disc fine.  There are five folders, and the folder names do have spaces in them.  This *might* be an issue for older players, but I doubt it.

So, why are they making it even easier to 'share files' with other people?  Aren't they afraid that many fans won't buy it & 'borrow' it instead from other fans? I don't think so.  Here's a few reasons I can think of why that is not the case:

1)  Among MANY other things, this set contains the incredibly rare 12 LP set that was sent out to other radio stations.  When I could find that set on eBay, it used to go for $100 alone. The 12 LPs originally sold for $225 for commercial broadcast & $110 for closed circuit college stations.  And, the 12 LP set is less than 1/4 of the total content.  The price is very affordable for the insane amount of material.

2) It comes with a full color book written/designed by Taylor Jessen, with photo collages by Phil Proctor.  Taylor's work is incredible.  (he's the same person who edited and restored/remastered the audio.  All 80 hours of it. Truly a labor of love) The book alone is worth the price.

3) Fans of the Firesign Theatre are on the most part, good-hearted people and realize that the 4 or 5 crayzee guys are not ultra-rich, and certainly are not going to get ultra-rich with the price point on this collection.  They are not ripping anyone off here.  This is a huge gift to the fan base.  Many of us have been waiting for our entire lives for this.  Heck, I tried for years just to get the 12 LP collection.  This is so much more than that.

So, how does this compare to their other material?  The quote on the back of the book by Richard Metzger sums it up best:

""This is comparable to being a James Joyce fanatic and finding not just one notebook where he's working out the themes he'd develop in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, but an entire crate of 'em... A countercultural treasure of the highest order""

THE BOOK
I mentioned before that this also comes with a full color, 107 page book.  It contains the aforementioned photo collages by Phil Proctor (which are really, really great!), an essay about the group, new interviews, and run downs of everything on the discs.  These linear notes take up almost 40 pages.  The collection is that big.

You can find pieces of the Deputy Dan Coloring Book in here, a cartoon of Bringing Up Father (you already know which one), and did I mention photo collages by Phil?  Some of them contain nude images, but I would not call any of them obscene.
