1866569,5,B00008Y1AI,"This is my first Kipper DVD. It is fun with simple ""from a child's imagination"" story lines. Kipper is not like Barney or Wiggles, trying to teach outright, but does a nice job promoting friendships using the ""whimsical days of childhood"".

1866574,5,B00008Y1AI,"""Fun In the Sun"" was our family's introduction to the Kipper series, which we'd only seen previously in previews on my 2-year-old's Thomas videos. The snippets I'd seen appealed to me, so I bought this video and was NOT disappointed. Kipper and his friends Pig and Tiger are thoroughly charming, thoroughly British and an absolute delight for me and my son. A wonderful choice for toddlers everywhere, with the added bonus of a quiet, gentle pace and jazzy soundtrack that will not get on a parent's last nerve, even after the 100,000th viewing. :-)",1130284800,4,549,4.851063829787234
