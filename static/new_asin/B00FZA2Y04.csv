8619711,3,B00FZA2Y04,"I watched it. I did not like the music. I liked the performances of Deragh Campbell and Hannah Gross. In fact, Hannah was in Marjorie Prime, and I found this movie after seeing that. I think my late wife would have given this 4 stars.",1518739200,,234,4.222222222222222
8619712,5,B00FZA2Y04,"A subtle, wonderful, and moving film.",1512950400,,37,5.333333333333333
8619713,1,B00FZA2Y04,Really bad acting and scriptwriting.  Boring plot.  There was no reason to finish it.  Just one awful movie and waste of time.,1404000000,,126,4.636363636363637
8619714,1,B00FZA2Y04,"What a sorry excuse for a film! There's no plot, no character development, no interesting dialogue and a lot of sub-mediocre-to-awful musical performances within the film that seem to go on forever. I watched it to the end (which isn't even an end; the film just stops at a certain unresolved point and leaves the viewer hanging), but it was a LONG hour and a half.

Very post-modern and arty, I suppose, but totally unsatisfying for this viewer.",1399852800,,446,4.717948717948718
8619715,2,B00FZA2Y04,I forced myself into watching this movie for 40 minutes or so before I gave up. It wasn't that it was hard to follow but it was very slow and I was easily distracted I found myself puzzled at what was going on when something actually did happen in the movie... which was rare.,1392768000,2,276,4.12962962962963
8619716,5,B00FZA2Y04,"First I must admit that I watched this DVD because it was filmed in Baltimore, where I live in the suburbs.  I was pleasantly surprised to find an intelligent movie with great acting and excellent music.  The pace is leisurely, befitting a summer film which doesn't rush to the end.  Spend 90 minutes with this film and I'm sure you will enjoy it.",1392336000,4,347,4.476190476190476
8619717,1,B00FZA2Y04,"This unremarkable film seems to have been produced as a showcase for some musical talent wrapped around a very flimsy plot.  As far as story lines go, there really isn't much that's new or exciting. It deals primarily with mild to moderate marital discord along with the comings and goings of two somewhat spoiled older adolescents attempting to, ""Find themselves."" On the other hand, if you're from the Baltimore area, you might get a kick out of viewing an extended scene filmed inside of the Prime Rib Restaurant--a well-known landmark in these parts.",1392076800,5,554,4.956989247311828
8619718,4,B00FZA2Y04,"When Taryn(Deragh Campbell), a Northern Irish runaway, finds herself in trouble, she seeks refuge in Baltimore with her aunt and uncle, Kim and Bill who are having problems of their own: they're trying to dissolve their marriage gracefully for the sake of their daughter Abby(Hannah Gross), just home from her first year of college.

A story of family revelations, letting go, and figuring out where you might find love next.",1391558400,4,425,5.071428571428571
