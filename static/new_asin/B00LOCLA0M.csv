6495030,5,B00LOCLA0M,"A young Jesus Freak has his faith in Jesus tested to it's limits, when the girl he falls in love with, has a family from hell.

A chilling essay on the evil that lurks in the hearts of men, the likes of which have not been seen since Pasolini's Salo. And while not on the epic scope of Pasolini's work, first time feature film helmer, Katrin Gebbe delivers a confident and dark, esoteric work, that slowly burns into crescendo with every frame and detail, leading the viewer further down a rabbit hole of sweltering evil.

Unknown actors add to the impending dread, each delivering multi layered performances, commendably so. Especially Julius Feldmeier,  who conveys a haunting sensitive performance, comparable to Mia Farrow's, in Rosemary's Baby.

A masterwork. Katrin Gebbe, is director to look out for.",1420070400,2,807,4.955555555555556
6495031,2,B00LOCLA0M,"Where to start on this one? Of course, the title is meant to be ironic, so it's no surprise when something bad does happen. It's just that bad is very bad. There's terror that involves a mad man in a horror flick; and terror when a victim gets caught up in enduring torture in return for favors, such as in the movie ""Cheap Thrills.""  And then there's terror as seen in this movie, when a seemingly normal family man turns out to be totally psycho and takes hostage a vulnerable young man. It's a story of escalating, meaningless brutality and mockery of the young man's faith. I guess if you need a possible backstory to the many victims that turn up in the news, this movie could offer that. Otherwise, there is no redemption. I suppose as a ""think piece"", there is a win somewhere that involves others in the family, but otherwise, it is like watching a crime unfold in slow motion. The two stars are for the brave and believable acting by all, especially the young man who plays Tore. This movie isn't for everyone. I don't think it was for me.",1415145600,4,1048,4.402061855670103
8667156,5,B00LOCLA0M,"This movie chilled me to my core... Only two other movies have had the same effect as this and those are ""The Girl Next Door"" and ""Boys Don't Cry""... The fact that all of them were based on fact makes it so much harder to watch... not for the faint but definitely worth the watch if you can handle it... Be prepared to be shocked and disgusted by this movie though.",1529452800,,365,4.154929577464789
8667157,5,B00LOCLA0M,"Not for the faint of heart for sure. But it is a powerfully told tale of what one person's faith will drive him to do, in spite of the horrific consequences. And, that it's based on real events makes it even more powerful.",1495843200,,222,4.186046511627907

8667159,1,B00LOCLA0M,"Nothing Bad Can Happen is a really slow movie that takes most of the movies duration for what your watching it for to finally kick in.  Basically a very naive, likely mentally challenged dole bludger, starts a religious group of other young religious people which he calls The Jesus Freaks.  They have concerts, most dress like goths or European punk rockers, and go around helping stranded motorists whose cars won't start when jumper leads aren't available by praying on the bonnet (hood).  It is one such encounter that the main character meets a middle aged man with a family who likes what he sees in the white curly haired lad.  Of course before driving off he was invited to the latest propaganda concert.  At the concert the speaker talks about how essential but difficult it is turning the other cheek.  After the young man has an epileptic seizure which is ignored by everyone else, the man decides to take the kid home with him to a place he is obviously squatting in, and begins subtly testing how literally he took that sermon. He also controls, puts down and abuses his other ""family"" members noting the young man does nothing to stop him.

For me the main character simply wasn't likable. He's happy to mooch of the German taxpayer while stating money means nothing to him.  Of course his tester is mightily pleased with that, happy to accept his ATM card and pin.  He witnesses many things that even if he doesn't believe in regular society laws, rights and wrongs, still breach religious wrongs.  Yet he does nothing.  Ridiculous comparisons could be made to him being like Jesus by not resisting his punishment and letting God delve out justice if he wishes, but I hardly think Jesus would have stood there and just watched others including children being mentally and physically harmed. This guy was simply dumb and self centered, doing nothing to try and score points for the afterlife while letting others suffer.  At the end a text blurb (subtitled in English like the German language speaking was) tells us this was based on a true story but doesn't give any other details such as did the other victims escape, did they live a normal life, how many of those that abused the guy were jailed, how long for or anything like that.",1485043200,,2249,4.694656488549619

8667163,5,B00LOCLA0M,"It's a story about a nice, well meaning, decent looking and fairly intelligent young man, who apparently has no family, has been poorly developed, is very foolish and naive, but has a deep faith in God, although, he seems very poorly catechized.  He's looking for a place to belong and a mission in life and he's likable, so he makes friends easily.  However, he hasn't learned that you can't change people, so you've got to let them be what they are.  In other words, you loving them and trying to set a good example, won't keep them from hating you and wanting to hurt you.  He also has no respect for any lesser authority than God Himself.  So, he seems to always end up offending the authority figures that he depends on for his lessor needs, like food, shelter and companionship.  Ultimately, this precipitates his destruction.  Although, he clings to his faith through it all, which is the only thing that makes it all bearable for him.  He seems like the kind of guy who needs to study and somehow reconcile books like, ""The 48 Laws of Power,"" and ""The Bible.""

In the end, it seems as if the young man's lack of wisdom encourages the villain's lack of faith, rather than converting him.

The acting was very good.  The sets were good.  I liked the script.",1440374400,,1263,4.515418502202643

8667165,5,B00LOCLA0M,"Intense, dark and truly a mind altering experience.

The music score and the jarring noises and intense sounds seem as if they crawl under your skin and give your mind a waking nightmare.

A thriller surrounded by a mental drama. A darkened state of religious belief, darkness and a horror inducing psychological trip.

The movie sends the viewer down a path that you never know where it's going. The feeling of the film is very tense and has a total sense of dread slowly building

Twisted, disturbing cinema. A masterpiece of emotions and deprivation. Floored on its dark brilliance. There has only been a hand full of times that a film has emotionally drained me. This makes another check on that list of emotionally draining cinema. I am still trying to get over this movie, it left me physically ill, and I literally mean that.

This is written by Katrin Gebbe. This is her first feature length film. It's a true unrelenting experience of tension both deep and dark. Truly a brutal debut that gives a shocking and numbing brutality. It's unique, original and something that leaves a bitter taste of emotions.

The acting is phenomenal. Julius Feldmeier gives truly an award worthy performance that creates inside the viewer watching an emotional tight rope that never lets up. Might I add this is Julius Feldmeier first feature? This being his first major starring role I am shocked at his acting excellence and what he gives inside this film is a reality and meaningful one of a kind ordeal like no other. His reality to the character, innocent, loving, childlike even in the face of such brutal actions is a spark of acting genius.

Disturbing is only a word until you have experienced this ultimate darkness and deprivation of humanity. Brutalization at its harshest. A movie that expressed evil of human nature. The animalistic darkness inside the very recesses of culture. The idea of evil at a true level is captured in this film. There are many films that shock and leave you dumbfounded and give an experience that leaves marks on the viewer, but very few films can express true insanity, true horror and the meaning of sadistic. Nothing Bad Can Happen is a film that makes you question what you just watched. It makes you angry. Its makes you saddened and depressed. It fills the emotional side with the feelings of torment and pain.
