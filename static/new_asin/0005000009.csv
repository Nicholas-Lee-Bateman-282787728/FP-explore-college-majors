179724,2,0005000009,"Though my favorite story ever is the story of Jesus, I really thought this movie would be more about the history and places where Jesus walked.  It wasn't.  It was basically the story we read in the bible with pictures of those places He visited.  I know the story, but not much about the places he went, themselves.",1360713600,8,316,4.413793103448276
179725,5,0005000009,"This is one of the best DVDs I've viewed on the archeology of the Holy Land. It talks about the archeology and shows some of it. The choice of sites is excellent. The photography is beautiful! The music is authentic.

I had no idea how much had been learned through archeology about the time and people of the New Testament!

I've been going over and over in my mind how we got to certain sites when I was there. Now some of that confusion has been explained. ""We've been wandering around for 15 minutes. I'm not sure I could find this place again.""  (paraphrasing) Watching them wander around the streets of Jerusalem on their way to one of the sites, it finally made sense why I didn't remember getting there. I felt much better knowing I wasn't the only one who was a little turned around.

There were explanations throughout of why 'traditional' sites were chosen, along with discussions of whether they should have been chosen or not. For example, I was actually annoyed to hear what was said about the traditional site of Golgotha, the site where Jesus was crucified, and the site where He traditionally was buried and rose again 3 days later. I really wanted to hear that The Garden Tomb was more likely to be the authentic site. I visited both last year. I found it so annoying to be in these sites of great importance and not be able to make sense out of what I was seeing because of all of the 'trim' everywhere. I would also like to see the rare art and museum  pieces, but building a church over the cave where Jesus was said to have been born, for example, makes it impossible to see anything that looks like an inn or a cave. I still have no idea what I was seeing when I was supposedly looking at the traditional tomb of Jesus. The Garden Tomb actually looked like exactly that. In this DVD, they explained that it couldn't have been, and they tell us why.  In all honesty, I'm glad to have facts, even if I'm annoyed to hear them.

The coverage of the Golden Gate where Jesus is expected to return and walk through those gates was excellent! It was worth watching the whole DVD because of the unexpected discovery of a young archeologist who 'fell through' an adjoining tomb. Fortunately, he took a picture of what he saw, because the next morning the area had been covered over in what appeared to be concrete. That was amazing!

Coverage of the area of Tiberias and the Sea of Galilee, Capernauum, etc., was wonderful.

This was an amazing presentation and well worth viewing for anyone who wants to know more.",1324857600,6,2528,4.466377440347071

179728,4,0005000009,"As a designer myself, it's basic knowledge that one keeps one's work unified with whatever medium they are using (colors, typefaces, graphics, etc) With this video though, it's a real mixture of different footage, different Jesus-es, different music, songs, and you have a main narrator but with other voices reading various lines in the script. It's a real fruit salad! Bells and whistles non-stop. A designer's nightmare so to speak... HOWEVER, oddly enough, it somehow worked with this video making it rather interesting. I actually enjoyed watching it all the way through. Some parts did get slow, but overall I do recommend it if you are interested in learning more about the happenings during Jesus' life.",1272499200,,711,5.137931034482759

You are moved from location to location as the story of Jesus' life and ministry is reinacted. Don't look for a lot of fancy special effects in the dramitization of the story of Jesus. That's not the point of the video. There is much outstanding footage of the shrines and churches that fill Jerusalem and the surrounding countryside that mark pivitol events from his life, death and resurrection. If you feel that you will never get there personally, owning this video is the next best thing.",1167696000,26,620,4.75
179730,4,0005000009,"I enjoyed thje film.  It was well done in presenting the possible persecutions that followed his resurection. The disbelief of His own people because of Jesus' humbleness was clearly depicted.  They expected some great war lord that would come to rule with the sword.

179747,3,0005000009,"Good.....for the way the producers and backers; Bill O'Reily wanted. Some scenes could have been placed in without seeing Angels or Devils. The entrance to the tomb, with Mary Magdalene being first, alone, then running back to the disciples still hiding in a house, then having to argue with (Simon) Peter would have been an excellent scene: all human. Christ, risen, as the Gardener, could have spoken to her without seeing Him; as could have the Angels in the tomb asking, then telling her the good news. These were ALL human scenes; based on Jesus holding a boy casting out devils (not scene) then brought to life. The way John the Baptist was presented, on a platter as written, was unnecssary. Showing his dismember head, as written in scripture, would have given the scene that was tried to be presented to the audience.
 In quick commentary it didn't  tell how the Pagan Roman Christians (Pope) was made to place John on the aisle.  Rome, first, tried to 'french fry' him in boing oil but without any success!, Peter was crucified upside down on the cross: The Pagan Pope being the Vicar of God, saw both men as false prophets interpreting their views by Satan; just as Christ was originally charged .

The Pagan Pope Christian changed many other Commandants without question, while John was still alive:  which today are kept. Asked, they proudly, in many written theses, state the Church was in Authority, hundreds of years before the rebellions during the 'dark ages.  Almost all (Protestors of the Dark Ages): Protestants keep the change of the 4th commandment: The Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday for convience. The Catholic Church changed by edict of the Vicar of God,: The Sabbath: Saturday to Sunday. AS Catholic authority: Any Priest will so state it, without having to use any scripture  as a reason. Many Protestant Ministers use scripture showing their interpretion to cover the change of God's Law in the Ten Commandments.  The quick, brief so called commentary of the ends of the disciples and in contenium was not finished.

The brief history of how both men died should have stated these, keeping all incidents in perspective. The Pagan Christian Pope changed many Jewish laws so the newly converted Christian Romans could swallow the new God",1433980800,,2265,4.892950391644908

179767,3,0005000009,"I think some clarification might be needed.  The Prime Instant Video description lists this as a 2006 movie.  The credits, however, say MCMXCVII (1997). To add to the confusion, the IMDb site lists it as 1995.  Am wondering which is correct.
Also of note is that the IMDb site neglects to give the name of the narrator shown in the end credits of the movie - Edmund Purdom.  I found it  very interesting that it was he, as I had just recently watched The Student Prince and the 1953 version Titanic. He was the star of The Student Prince and had the role of the 2nd Officer in the movie Titanic.
It was nice to see some of the areas where Jesus did walk.  I was heart broken to see so many ""churches"" erected over the possible sites of Biblical history.  Understandably the areas needed shelter but why all the murals, windows, incense burners?  Those are all the things Jesus was against.  He was talking about the spiritual kingdom of Almighty God, and worshiping God, not a kingdom made by humans, worshiping buildings of ornamentation, nor making a place a shrine.",1422144000,,1068,4.549738219895288

179795,4,0005000009,"Beautiful videography in a documentary format that follows the life of Jesus on a visual tour of the Holy Land. The film starts out promisingly, showing Christian pilgrimage sites and other things you cannot see unless you visit Israel. But the narrated recreations of Jesus's life, while charmingly quaint at first, grow increasingly distracting as they gradually come to dominant the film. By the end of this overlong (70 minutes) visual meditation on the life of Christ, we are watching a poorly dubbed and hammily recreated passion play. The interesting pilgrimage sites and descriptive narration of the holy land disappears by the end. Although the concept is good and the scenery is beautiful, the film increasingly put me to sleep as it descended into hokey narration. Worth a look for younger kids, but anyone older will probably find it a bit painful to watch. The visuals and music are still very well done.",1382140800,5,917,5.0

Many movie cut scenes making this documentary not only good to learn, but entertaining as well.",1380672000,2,139,5.666666666666667

179800,4,0005000009,"This video was very interesting. It had some new information to me.

Be be warned- this is not just a video about where Jesus walked.

I really wanted to watch a video about the places Jesus went.... The Sea of Galilee etc. This video had some of that but it did not have a lot of that by the end. It started off with information about the places Jesus walked, but before too long it turned into a video about the story of Jesus.

The other thing to be aware of is that this is a dated video. It is slightly older and as such does not use newer discoveries. Some of the video in this video also seems older than other parts. The colors look faded and seem dated in places.

Overall the video isn't long and if you have Amazon Prime it is worth the time to watch it. I probably wouldn't spend much money to watch it though.

Enjoy.",1373328000,,830,4.098765432098766
179801,4,0005000009,"I have not read this book, but based on the other reviews and the title, I think it might be the next book I read.  Either that or the idiots guide to bathroom tiling because I need to redo my bathroom.  My wife has been driving all of us nuts with how badly the tiles are arranged.  Which is really why this book is so important.  When jesus walked on water, he walked I'm assuming in a roughly strait trajectory.  When I'm walking on our bathroom floor, I am always walking a bit diagonally because of the  crooked layout.  I think if I buy both books (and read them haha) I will be able to walk as Jesus did and have a really fantastic bathroom.",1372550400,,648,4.136
179802,1,0005000009,My grandma made me and my brother watch this when we were like 8. It was soooooo boooooring and the host was so dull. I did have some use with it as a sleep aid.
