2437542,5,B000BQ5J22,"I literally flew across the continent (from St. John's, Newfoundland to San Francisco, California) to attend the first screening of Live Freaky! Die Freaky! I even booked the first 2 tickets to the show. Disappointed, I was not. Mingling with John Roecker (director) and members of Rancid and AFI, entering the decrepit-looking Roxy theater on the ""Helter Skelter"" carpet, and sitthing through the most outrageous dark comedy I've ever seen was the time of my life. Green Day's Billie Joe (my idol, for the record) was superb as the voice of Charles ""Hanson"", his shameless, sexual, shock-value comedy kept me in stitches, along with AFI's Davey Havok's portrayal of Sharon ""Hate's"" very gay hair stylist. The film does have a lack of taste, but we were all warned, so people need not complain if they choose to see it. Personaly, I loved how the entire audience would switchs from laughing hysterically to groaning with disgust (and I'm pretty sure they did, too). Basically, this is a risque, dark, shocking movie that is not for the blue collar working man (or his pretty wife). However, if you like to see people pushing the envelope and doing something completely out of whack (but still trying to make a point), then please give this movie a chance. It has gotten some rotten reviews, just remember you are your own best critic.",1133136000,18,1334,4.855263157894737
2437543,2,B000BQ5J22,"LIVE FREAKY! DIE FREAKY! almost defies description. It is a musical horror comedy about Charlie Manson and The Manson Family as told by deranged clay puppets. John Roecker directs this psychedelic nightmare that is not unlike Jim Van Bebber's outrageous film THE MANSON FAMILY. Roecker enlists the help of alternative rockers Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, Tre Cool, Kelly Osbourne, Travis Barker, and many others to voice Manson and the rest of the sadistic characters. The crude stop-motion animation is just plain disturbing, like a Technicolor Tool music video that lasts over an hour. LF!DF! takes puppet sex, drugs, and rock and roll to their furthest and most disgusting extremes since MEET THE FEEBLES. Roecker's tasteless writing is clearly intended to shock and offend the audience in any and every way possible, which he has certainly achieved. As if the subject matter and awful humor weren't enough, he also demonizes the victims and blames them for their own destruction. All of the dialog is as heavy and indecipherable as The Family's beliefs, and it isn't nearly as smart or funny as Roecker would want you to believe. The only thing that is more surprising than the fact that so many rock icons signed on to the project is that anyone with John Roecker's animation skills and imagination would waste their talent on this garbage. LIVE FREAKY! DIR FREAKY! should only be seen for the simple fact that a film of its nature even exists.

2437544,4,B000BQ5J22,"This was without a doubt one of the craziest movies I've ever seen. It was so wrong on so many levels. It was dirty, disturbing, filthy, and very funny! When Susie Hatkins is on an acid trip, she meets Charlie Hanson. She joins his cult and starts killing people for him. If you wanna see a unique crazy musical about the Manson massacre, you might enjoy LIVE FREAKY DIE FREAKY!!!",1283904000,,380,4.442857142857143
2437545,1,B000BQ5J22,"I'm a big fan of John Waters and David Lynch type cult films.  I also love musicals and claymation, so the combination looked like a winner, even though I'm not a fan of the Charles Manson story.  On top of that, Asia Argento's name was on it and usually her involvement in a film is a treat.  This DVD is pure garbage on so many levels.  It was bad enough listening to the horrible theme song go on and on during the menu screen (I made the mistake of inserting the DVD and going off to do something while it loaded).  Then you play the film and are treated to a full 2 minutes of the title on screen.  I forwarded it after 30 seconds.  The film is just awful!  I hate when filmmakers think they are trying to make a statement or give you some enlightening message, while using shock tactics and bad taste.  John Waters makes this work, this filmmaker does not.  I have seen a lot of bad films and a lot of films people would find insulting.  This is one of the few that had me disgusted and insulted. On top of that, with the amount of musical talent involved, you would think that the music would at least be a selling point.  The music is horrible and most songs go on way too long!  Not worth viewing at all!  I'm glad I bought the film at Big Lots for cheap.  And even then, I still felt ripped off!",1275177600,,1305,4.102766798418973

2437548,1,B000BQ5J22,"I want 2 hours of my life back..(well an hour because I couldn't watch the rest of this terrible human mistake). It is written, without any focus. Half the time it wants to be a comedy, and the rest of the time it wants to be social commentary. One can only assume the topic of the Manson family was a weak attempt to be cool. The subject matter is created with less edge or controversy than a mini van commercial. The most unbearable part were retarded amount of sex jokes that come out of no where. ""Hey how's it goin Billy?""... ""That huge sperm shooting cock in my mouth is great"" said Billy. I hate myself for having watched as much of this hackneyed trash as I did. I would rather be burned with cigarettes than watch this again. At least burning myself would make me feel like I was being productive with my time.",1213920000,,819,4.290322580645161

2437552,1,B000BQ5J22,"Honestly, I love cult classics almost as much as I love punk rock and all that. But, this film is horrible. Even Davey Havok couldn't salvage this film. I waited almost 2 years for this to come out in theaters in San Francisco. I ended up seeing it at the same screening as Davey Havok. This is an awful film...and it really dissapointed me.

2437554,3,B000BQ5J22,"If possible I would have given this movie a 2.5 but a 3 will do. Let me start off by saying that this movie, is well....Freaky. The stop motion animation isn't the greatest but the kind of people that will watch this movie probably won't care. The music is the best part of it, it's also the reason I bought it. It's all star cast includes punkers such a Billy Joe Armstrong, Tim Armstrong, Davey Havok, and many more. The story is pretty much of a man trying to decide if he, being a godless nomad, should worship Charles Manson when he finds the book Helter Skelter.

The story is sub-par and the acting is pretty bad and the script is that filled with gay jokes and swear words. As said before, not for the easily offended. I've had this movie for maybe around a month and I've only watched it twice. Once on my own and once with a friend. It's not something I plan on watching again for lesuire. But it is a fun movie to say you own. So 3 stars. Have a nice day.",1173312000,3,966,4.138297872340425
2437555,5,B000BQ5J22,"This movie is the absolute best f*!$ing film ever! It's basically a horribly politically incorrect interpretation of the Charles Manson murders, all from The Family's point of view.

Though I suggest you read Helter Skelter before watching it (It makes it even funnier) It's still awesome without knowing much about the Manson Murders.

This movie is not for the weak at heart",1142640000,10,348,4.523809523809524

2437565,2,B000BQ5J22,"This movie is only for people who have so many cult-classics, that they need something new.

When a work of art shocks with the intention of teaching a lesson, it can shine. When it shocks with the intention of shocking, it loses all artisic value. The majority of the shock in Live Freaky, Die Freaky is just there to shock.

I did give it two stars though, so I have to justify that. I think that the premise of this movie was a good starting point for what could have been a brilliant, if not corny and bloody cult classic. It just didn't deliver.

There are a few people who will enjoy the movie. I'm not critisizing them. They will enjoy it for the punk voices (that's what had me interested), and the silliness. There's nothing wrong with that.",1141776000,14,750,4.381294964028777
2437566,1,B000BQ5J22,"I don't care how punk rock this film is. I love punk and I'm a fan of Tim Armstrong and AFI. However, this film is the worst thing I've ever paid to see. I was at the San Francisco premiere and it was nice meeting everyone involved in the movie. When it came to watching the movie itself, I was completely disappointed. I like indie films, stupid humor, and the concept of DIY as much as the next person. However, this film was just done in such poor taste. The editing is terrible. The story is hard to follow. There's almost nothing I like about the movie. The only real funny part is hearing Davey Havok of A.F.I. be the voice of the gay hairstylist. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend that anyone buy this. Try to borrow it from someone else if you can help it. It's not worth $21.99. To be honest, I'd give it less than 1 star if I could but that's the lowest that the rating will go.",1141603200,11,892,4.161849710982659
2437567,3,B000BQ5J22,"the 3 stars i gave this film were for billie joe's voicework.

the film itself isn't anything you can watch more than once, not because it's too weird or anything, but simply because the editing job is absolutely terrible.

the film is a great concept, but it just drags along because of some poor voiceovers and the choppy editing.

considering this took like four years to finish, john roecker could have definately done better.

billie joe, however, does a great job, and the behind the scenes feature on his night of recording lines was a real plus.

if his name wasn't attached, you probably wouldn't know it was him. i don't recognize him at first, and that's coming from a long-time fan of his bands.

all in all, its worth a watch once, but borrow it from someone before deciding to purchase it.",1141603200,4,803,4.580419580419581
2437568,3,B000BQ5J22,"I'd been waiting to watch this movie,and when I finally got it into my dvd player, I was kind of disappointed. Basically, porno with puppets. A lot of talk about cocks, drug consumption, puppet sex. Kick ass idea, but got overshadowed by puppet porno. I like what the director talks about in his inteview on the inside sleeve, and found it more interesting than the movie. If your not thinking for yourself already, I don't think this movie is going to open your eyes and free your mind.",1141257600,5,487,4.545454545454546
2437569,5,B000BQ5J22,"This movie is SO rediculously funny.  Definitely one of my new favorites.  Everybody I've shown it to so far has either loved it or said ""oh, that was interesting"".  If you want a deep, insightful message on society's perversions... see this movie.  If you're overly sensitive and can't wrap your mind around ANIMATED gore, blood, or sex humor... don't bother, you won't get the message.

And the fact that the cast is (mostly) punk as frick just makes it that much more awesome.  Old school punk mixing with new skool something.  Rancid played an awesome acoustic show at the DVD launch (Matt looks alive and well).  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  Look out Rocky Horror... here's a new cult.",1140393600,4,711,4.715447154471545

It has everything. It has a low budget and it still has everything that a big box ofice smash has! Put it this way, i was waiting about 4 years for this film and when i saw it...i was far from dissappointed, i loved it. Ive watched it several times now and in my honest opinion it just gets better. In regards to the whineing people saying that all this stuff actually happened, you've just added into the mix of Pro's, its educational!! I think your afraid of this film, fear is just another kind of awareness, awareness is another kind of love, so once you completely rid of all the fear all that is left is awareness....and that is left is love. ;). John Roecker is brilliant and spent a lot of time and money over this film. and i for one LOVE it!",1140220800,5,912,4.247126436781609

It made me think about society, about history, about trends, about crowds, about dreams, about lonliness...it just made me think. It may be crude, it may push the line on decency, it may offend some...but that's the point! No message has even been effective if it was weak and not afraid to offend. I really feel sorry for the people who just don't get it because they are missing out on something truly amazing here.

PLUS this movie was done for less than $40k. That in itself is indepedent and punk rock. Old punk attitude. No one will back your view so you do it yourself the way you want to do it any way you can. I think people are expecting a slicked over Tim Burton/Team America $30+ million budgets type movie. This movie is what punk is all about.,1140134400,3,502,4.239583333333333
2437573,1,B000BQ5J22,"I'm not a Christian red-stater or pro-censorship, and I thought this movie was awful, sick trash.  One thing that people should realize is that the way it is described is completely misleading:  it says it's about some future person who finds Helter Skelter and thinks Charles Manson is a messiah.  Sounds sort of weird and South-Parky; probably tasteless, but possibly with something to say about religion and what people worship, etc.  Well, there's like three seconds of that storyline at the beginning.  Then the rest of the movie makes no reference to that at all; it is just a reenactment of the Manson ""family"" and the awful things they did.  And, hello, it isn't ""loosely based"" on what they did--it is pretty much EXACTLY what they did.  To real people.  Look it up.

One last thing:  why do so many men think it's really funny to produce/watch a depiction of a pregnant woman being butchered?  How you would you feel if someone did that to your wife or girlfriend or sister and then forty years later some rich spoiled jerks made a movie with puppets portraying her grisly, shocking death just to amuse themselves?",1140048000,7,1124,4.742268041237113

It's very loosely based on the Manson family, mostly it's meant to be a filthy romp that thumbs its nose at those who take ANYTHING seriously-- whether it's god, facts or the rules of animation. It's amazing how much work went into this film! And let's say you still not sure if you want to buy it after reading all these great reviews: the music stands up all by itself. Tunes just as catchy as anything in Hedwig or Jesus Christ Superstar. There should be an accompanying CD, dang it to heck!",1139875200,3,554,4.4411764705882355

But here's what's really wrong with this film: the people depicted are not fictitious. Charlie Manson may have become a pop culture caricature but his victims were real - and their families are still alive. Sharon Tate has a sister still fighting for the rights of crime victims. The LaBiancas had children. Steve Parent was only 18. Sharon Tate's baby would be 36. That baby really was carved out of his mother and killed. It really happened.

John Roecker delves into the depths of pop culture with great zeal and comes up with a hilarious social commentary on media obsession. Everything works here from the witty songs to the re-imagining of all those claymation characters from those holiday specials from the 60s and 70s, who in this film have turned onto the Brady Bunch from hell better known as The Manson Family. Roecker drops quite a few symbolic messages in this film if you're smart enough to catch them, its not just a gross out film..this is an artist saying something about the enviroment he sees. I feel we all have a sick and twisted side to ourselves and I think John Roecker is just one of the brave who is willing to show it.

Mr. Roecker obviously has more creativity and talent in his little finger than all of you boring, miserable, and judgemental idiots put together!!!  This movie is meant to be fun, tongue in cheek, visually stimulating and most of all, a fresh and ironic view of the way cult leaders can poison young minds!  Mr. Roecker, in my mind, has the ability to disect a very disturbing reality in our culture in a way that the not so ""retarded"" punks will watch, reflect on and hopefully learn to never buy in to the main stream!!!  The punk mentality is everywhere

not just in kids with peircings and bondage pants.  Use your brains for more than what your schools, church, or boss expect of you!!  Kids, Buy this movie!!!!!

Then I see it and reality sets in. The clay-mation is terrible. The worst quality ever seen. Those old holiday specials are better than this. The voices are dubbed horribly, and most of the voices are more annoying than children doing a school project. The script is bad, flat out bad. Every line is meant to sound vile and obscene, and make the characters saying them sound stupid. But really... they just sound stupid.

8091061,5,B000BQ5J22,"One of the best films I have seen. I feel like this work of art is very underrated. I believe pseudo history is a subject that is a subject that is not touched that often, and this is a good piece to add to the public. Choosing the Manson murders for a fictional script was a great vehicle to express to the public the corruptions and ludicrousness of a police state, psychopathy, wealth inequality, that was done in a humorous fashion. Highly recommend this.

P.S. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.",1434240000,,504,4.478260869565218

8091063,3,B000BQ5J22,I don't know if this will end up being a cult classic. I don't have any plans on watching it more than the one time but...The soundtrack is cool and I appreciate the art of the whole thing. This is by no means historically accurate and I hope it wasn't meant to be. Usually I can't stand when artistic license is taken when truth is stranger than fiction and in the true crime genre (HATED the Black Dahlia movie) BUT..they're puppets sooo..Who cares. Worth owning. Not a masterpiece but I'm happy with my purchase nonetheless.,1391040000,,527,4.557894736842106
8091064,1,B000BQ5J22,"I'm one of those weirdos who loves Manson trivia/stories, I've been morbidly fascinated since I first got my hands on a copy of 'Helter Skelter.' This...is beyond terrible. How can it be BEYOND terrible? It's easy, it seems....just take a bunch of artists who think because they are doing something incredibly low budget it must be artist and outre, yes? Sorry, but no. It's 'punching yourself repeatedly would be more entertaining' awful. Really, really REALLY awful.",1372982400,,468,5.171052631578948
