5737659,5,B00CSCKL0C,"This movie and study guide is a ""must see"" for every American. See how our forefathers dealt with the issue of ""separation of Church and state"".",1393718400,,144,4.576923076923077
5737660,5,B00CSCKL0C,This documentary shows how our founding fathers belief in our almighty God directed their founding of the rules and laws of our country.,1391644800,,136,4.956521739130435
5737661,5,B00CSCKL0C,"Very Educational and Entertaining. I'm a former school teacher and I was amazed at what I did not know about the Pilgrims.
The film inspired me to learn more about the founding of our country. I recommend it to everyone, especially homeschoolers.",1391299200,2,246,4.880952380952381
5737662,5,B00CSCKL0C,"Note: There are 2 versions of this movie. One is a single DVD, Monumental: In Search of America's National Treasure and the other is this 5 DVD set, Monumental: Restoring America As The Land of Liberty. The 5 DVD set contains the movie (disk 5) and 4 additional disks of additional information plus a book. Both are recommened, but I recommend this one because you get a lot for your money.

Kirk Cameron is to be congratulated on a great job with this movie. The movie is a little like a mystery and the ending is way better than expected. A lot of people are going to hate this movie. Not because its a bad movie, but because it's such a very good movie. Facts are a stubborn thing. They don't go away just because you don't like them. Watch it America. Learn who you are, and your lost history. I also recommend Runaway Slave to go with this. Completely different movie, but another gem of independent movie making about America.

I read the negative comments (1 star) on the single disk DVD for this movie and they are just comical. It's really like most did not watch the movie because they make claims that are easily shown to be untrue. Just watch the DVDs and decide for yourself.",1391299200,48,1188,4.420091324200913
5737663,5,B00CSCKL0C,"For the majority of Americans which have received the Liberal Progressive polluted, revisionist history of the founding of this country, this is a great introduction to the true difference of the establishment of this country versus other countries.  It clearly defines how the origins of this country set it on a course for greatness, and how close we are to actually losing the extraordinary difference the United States has over other countries.",1391212800,2,448,5.222222222222222

5737674,5,B00CSCKL0C,"A very inspiring movie and series. Even for a Dutch person like me, it answers what does a biblical basis for society and government look like? What is the basis of true freedom in a nation? And the proof of it can be seen around the world, which nations are free nations? The ones that have a Christian background. Get inspired to go and teach your kids and defend the truth.",1436745600,,376,4.309859154929577

5737701,5,B00CSCKL0C,K. Cameron did a fantastic job on this film. He obviouslyspent a great deal of time on research before filming. Every parent and grandparent  needs to get back to the basics of our freedom AND/the cost to our forefathets...they were Bible based believers just as we need to be today.,1395187200,,283,4.66

5737703,5,B00CSCKL0C,"I'm heavily involved in the liberty movement in America and after much experience, learning and continual research, I cannot stress how vital it is to our success that we centralize God's word in how we think and what we do.  Without the biblical view coupled with our historical view, we're doomed to return to tyranny shortly after any success we may have.  It's simple causality.

 Like a magnifying glass, this study guide (book and DVD's) expands the movie's messages TIMES FOUR.  There are other quality sources (such as Michael Anthony Peroutka's ""American View"" course or any material produced by The John Birch Society), but this is a purchase I am proud to recommend and just like the movie itself, friends will be borrowing this set as well.

  There's a reason the fat cats ""pulling the strings"" and those vain and aspiring men and women who occupy the highest seats in government do NOT want US to use these Christian beliefs, knowledge base and thought processes that are so inherently conducive to liberty of a truly free people.  Over many generations, they've been successful in removing it from our schools and almost from society itself, for without Christian values their selfish goals become infinitely easier to achieve.  The constitution hasn't failed us any more than God's word has.  This study guide helps teach the tools for our hard work to be more effective in getting back to both.",1394150400,21,1411,4.9113924050632916

8585751,5,B00CSCKL0C,"This is an outstanding documentary that I would recommend to anyone to view (not just Americans). It explains in detail the effect of Christianity on the founding of the United States, and the fact that Christianity is a core foundation of American values, traditions, and why the U.S. was established the way it was by the Founding Fathers.
The Liberty Matrix monument located in Plymouth is a monument I was not aware of, and the movie explains its meaning in detail, and what it represents is what is needed to restore America to the land of liberty (as the title of the documentary says).",1479081600,4,592,4.701923076923077
