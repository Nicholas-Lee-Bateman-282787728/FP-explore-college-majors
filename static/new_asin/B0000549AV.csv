7930787,5,B0000549AV,"This series is an outstanding beginning to Yoga, or any other exercise routine. Yoga Zone gracefully overcame a paradox, which is to market teachings of a method that is so deeply against aggression and competition. They make mind-body awareness accessible to an audience who at best has seen bumper-stickers, posters, and flyers on the topic.

At the risk of enormous generalities, they are mainstream north-Americans, who do not appear to be rooted in ideological wars, neither on political, religious nor ethnic fronts. They tease out the essence of the yogic approach to spirituality and physiology, and present it, in a manner that is relevant to the experiences and needs of the secularly-minded western audience.

They also, remarkably, use the routine to compensate for the casualties of our hyper-technical, cushy lifestyle, and the pressures of our rigid work-ethic.

Personally, these videos alone introduced me to Yoga and to physiology in general. I have fibromyalgia, and I began to feel a lot better when I started following their stretches, and listening to their advice.

Those who are master yoga practitioners might take an interest in their delicate approach.  For those who are not interested in Yoga, it offers an excellent model, of how to incorporate awareness into a physical fitness routine. The dynamic stretches presented would make great 20 minute warm-ups for a more strenuous cardio or resistance routine.

Wonderful, inspiring work.

7930788,3,B0000549AV,"I would not recommend that beginners buy this as a place to start.  It's really just short, separate segments from their TV series.  I was expecting a more developed, explanatory format,like their other videos featuring Alan Finger (which are better).  Those other videos are a much better place to start!  This was a disappointing set.",1004745600,5,336,5.054545454545455
7930789,5,B0000549AV,"I chose this beginners set because I had never done a yoga pose in my life... but was ready to begin. This is an excellent set for beginners. It is easily paced and (for the most part) the instructors are great at explaining the poses and what you should be feeling or reaching for. There seems to be 2 mistakes in the Total Body Conditioning - where they miss ""doing the other side"", and I'm not overly fond of the student-teacher's instruction in the second session on the same tape.
However, I am extremely satisfied with the tapes and noticed improvements in my flexibility almost immediately. There are 2 ~15 minute sessions on each tape - and I beat the boredom by mixing the sessions together. (I have a short attention span!) If you've never done yoga, these tapes are a great place to start.",1003449600,6,800,4.524137931034483
7930790,5,B0000549AV,"I'm a yoga novice. After using a couple of hour-long Yoga Zone tapes for a little while (featuring instructor Alan Finger), my wife and I decided to look for shorter sessions. We've been very happy with this three-tape set, which includes six 20-minute sessions, lead by other Yoga Zone instructors.
One reason I love these tapes is that they all demonstrate modified versions of the poses for beginners and the less-flexible. Sometimes the instructors topple, too, which is good for the beginner ego. The second reason I love these tapes is (I must admit) one of the instructors is stunningly gorgeous. So every time my wife suggests doing yoga, I'm enthusiastic about it. Hey - every little extra bit of motivation helps, right?",993081600,30,730,4.943089430894309

Included are : ""Yoga for Abs"", ""Introduction to Power Yoga for Beginners"", and ""Total Body Conditioning"". Hope this helps!",975801600,230,235,4.488372093023256
