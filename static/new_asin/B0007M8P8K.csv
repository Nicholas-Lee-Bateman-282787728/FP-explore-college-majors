8048905,1,B0007M8P8K,"I'm not sure if this is some kind of the joke or what? The lessons are sooo dull. After watching it for 30 minutes not only me but my daughter, who is a very a very enthusiastic about dance, we were both bored. This is a big joke and if you plan to spend money, look for something else.",1379635200,,286,3.864406779661017
8048906,5,B0007M8P8K,"This video is cute old nursery rhymes done to some very entertaining toe tapping. My kids loved it from age 3 and 4 to now age 5 and 6... the kids loved dancing with the actors and doing the same movements and the music is very catchy, the kids were singing these songs all day long!!! Great buy for kids who love to sing and dance!!!! (Moms, you might find your self singing too!)",1289952000,,381,4.162162162162162
8048907,1,B0007M8P8K,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter and was excited to get it after reading several rave reviews (including one in a magazine.)  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed.  This didn't keep the attention of my daughter or my 5 year old son.  I even found it boring.  Most of the songs have only one set of feet dancing to them.  I thought there would be several pairs of feet dancing to each song which I believe would have kept us all a little more entertained - sort of like ""Riverdance"" only without the upper body.  This was definitely a waste of money.  It is slow paced and lacks the ""wow"" factor I was looking for.",1194739200,,628,4.316239316239316
8048908,5,B0007M8P8K,"Nursery Tap, Hip to Toe Volumes I and II are my favorite gifts for baby showers and birth announcements. Infants love listening to the nursery rhymes on CD, and children as young as 9 months love watching the rhymes performed in a variety of dance styles.  The choreography is charming and tells a story; the sets and costumes are simple and clever. The device of showing only the dancers' bodies and feet allows children to imagine the characters. Our copies are very popular with our six year-old and her older sister dances along.  I highly recommend Nursery Tap to all parents looking for a break from Disney, Nickelodeon and Baby Einstein.",1172793600,7,644,4.792792792792793
8048909,5,B0007M8P8K,"Both Nursery Tap, Hip to Toe (Volume One and Two) were given to my twin daughters when they were three and have been a favorite ever since!  My girls are now five, and are still drawn into the magic of these one of a kind masterpieces.  The rythmic nursery rhmes set to dance are a must see for kids...my daughters LOVE them!

In their own words...""I like it because I like to see the dancing"" and "" I like it because...I don't know, I just love it so much!""

I would recommend these fabulous DVD's to any family with young children.  It is by far a favorite in our house and I'm sure it will be in yours!",1172793600,6,605,4.093220338983051
8048910,1,B0007M8P8K,"I can see why people talk about the creativity in this movie.  It is not like anything I have seen before.  However, the ""creativity"" is actually quite frightening to both my child and myself.  This movie is creepy.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  The only value this movie may have is for a child who is very serious about dance lessons to be able to watch the footwork.",1172448000,,379,4.357142857142857
8048911,5,B0007M8P8K,"I teach dance and have four kids ages 8,6,4,2. My kids watch this over and over. They are even learning the dances. It is literally just the dancers waists down and did seem strange at first, but I love how it show emotions can be portrayed through pure dance, not facial expressions. I also appreciate that it comes with a cd so we can listen in the car. I've incorporated some of the nursery rhyme/dance with my younger dance classes. Great product!",1172188800,5,451,4.512195121951219
8048912,5,B0007M8P8K,"This is a great video for toddlers! The formatting and design helps children practice their language skills and work on their fine motor skills (movement), while introducing them to the performing arts.",1127692800,7,202,5.34375
