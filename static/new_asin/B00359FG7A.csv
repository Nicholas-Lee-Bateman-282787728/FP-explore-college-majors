8616048,1,B00359FG7A,"This is the worse ""documentary"" that I have EVER seen and in NO WAY is representative of Barbados, the beautiful paradise that my family and I have holidayed in on numerous occasions over the past thirty years. Just like Tiger Woods, my (then) girlfriend and I fell in love with the island on our first visit, and exclaimed, ""When we marry, it MUST be in Barbados!""... AND WE DID twenty-eight years ago.

The makers of this ""documentary"" should withdraw this product from the market and apologize to the people of Barbados, along with the many celebrities like Simon Cowell, Rihanna, Oprah Winfrey, Roberta Flack, Sir. Cliff Richard, the British royal family, etc. who own mansions on the island and visit several times annually, after having fallen in love with its beauty, charm and wonderful people.

They never mentioned the myriad of world-famous, luxury hotels like Sandy Lane Hotel, The Crane, Barbados Hilton, etc. and world-renown restaurants like The Cliff, Cin Cin, Champers, etc. nor did they show the magnificence of the west, east and south coast beaches which are among the world's finest!",1348876800,,1104,5.027322404371585
8616049,1,B00359FG7A,"This dvd needs to be confiscated by the Barbados Department of Tourism and will be shortly I suspect. It is the worst tourism promoting DVD and does nothing but damage to the potential tourist about to visit the Island!
In fact, everyone we showed it to said ""Why would anyone want to go to that place after watching this dvd!!
It was produced by some backwoods, poorly educated person who is a danger to himself and others with a video camera.

We plan on sending our copy to the prime minister of Barbados to file suit against the person who produced this trash.",1284854400,,564,4.475728155339806
