8418890,5,B0049AF6TW,"Okay, I have friends who think this series is awful. I only got hooked because I viewed two shows on an airplane where I was bored enough to try it. Personally, I think it's great. I, too, had thought ""What could be funny about a person with an identity disorder?"" but (a) Toni Collette is amazing and (b) what can I say? It's funny. Yep, sad moments, but it's a crazy world out there. Naturally, the DVDs arrived quickly and in perfect order - as usual with Amazon.",1316304000,,466,4.306818181818182
