8255401,4,B0014EAV8W,"This DVD is exactly what it says it is, a ""getting started"" guide for Adobe After Effects CS3. While not a true tutorial showing the full fuctionality of AE (it would have to be a multi-disk set to even scratch the surface), the presenter does a good job showing the interface, workflow, and basic functionality.

For beginers, and at this price, this is a great product!
