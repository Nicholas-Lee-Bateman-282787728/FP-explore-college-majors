3791545,5,B001TK80GG,"I don't drink, but after watching the series, I started on the path to learning. Zane is crazy, and this show is better (IMHO) to drinking made easy. Sit back, throw a few back and enjoy the show.",1334620800,,196,4.184210526315789
3791546,5,B001TK80GG,This is one of my favorite shows.  The ONLY drawback is that there are not enough episodes.  Each one makes me want to travel to that location.,1304035200,,143,4.2592592592592595
3791547,5,B001TK80GG,"Listen, I get tired of mentioning bits from this series or referencing it when talking with other expats and then having to explain to you people what the H3ck the gag is.  Just get the d@mn thing already.
Seriously, if you like gonzo travel and think Amazing Race is an international panty-raid, you'll enjoy this.",1301270400,,315,4.7272727272727275
3791548,5,B001TK80GG,"Ever since my friend first told me about the show (back when they were on MOJO) I fell in love with it! The show really teaches the viewer about different types of drinks and different drinking cultures from around the world. Though this may sound boring to some, the way Zane Lamprey hosts the show, it's a riot! I would recommend this show for anyone who's curious about learning the differences between the different types of whiskeys (or, whiskys if you're Scottish) and other alcoholic beverages and to the people who want to play along with the game that Zane has throughout the show! *burps* DRINK!",1277856000,2,605,4.716981132075472
3791549,5,B001TK80GG,This show is great for those who love to travel or at least who love to try different drinks from other countries.  It is pretty funny and is informative at the same time!,1264982400,6,171,4.181818181818182
8341884,5,B001TK80GG,"Great, funny travel show and a good value for 3 seasons.",1462665600,,56,4.181818181818182
8341885,5,B001TK80GG,"Too bad zane stopped on his 4th season, this is a great combo pack.",1451952000,,67,3.857142857142857
8341886,5,B001TK80GG,"Lots of fun to watch. I have seen them all on Netflix then HULU, Its not just about drinking booze, though that is the fun focus. Its about other people, cultures and style. Zane travels the world to go drink. Mojo should have made a season 5. It really is that good.",1449100800,,267,4.153846153846154
8341887,5,B001TK80GG,"One thing to keep in mind while watching the early episodes-Zane didn't start out as the kindest, or most worldly traveler. His relations with locals in the first few episodes were (for me) cringeworthy. He starts to find his footing eventually, but that does put a damper on most of my enjoyment of Season 1. But if you love to travel (or love the idea of traveling) and love to drink, this is a great show to learn about how the rest of the world drinks.",1443312000,,456,4.313953488372093
8341888,5,B001TK80GG,"classic, it's aging a little but still vary relevant and funny",1437868800,,62,4.7272727272727275
8341889,5,B001TK80GG,This show is the best. It makes me want to travel all over the world and drink. Best drinking game at home with friends.,1424995200,,120,4.041666666666667
8341890,5,B001TK80GG,"Regarding the aspect ratio.

If these DVDs are playing in a 4:3 aspect ratio on your TV, then don't worry, all you need to do is change the aspect ratio on your DVD player or TV.

What im saying is that none of the picture is cut off. It is just scrunched into a 4:3 aspect ratio and is not meant to be like that. The sides of the picture are not cut off, I have done comparisons with the Hulu version which are in the original 16:9 aspect ratio.

I am saying this because in some review for the First Season DVD set, which is included in this package on the same exact discs, people were complaining about it playing in 4:3 aspect ratio.

Also, please realize that on a 16:9 screen, you should not have black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. Unfortunately with the first season i was unable to avoid this. The point is that if your picture is in 4:3 or is showing black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, this is not how it is supposed to be viewed. It is supposed to fill the whole 16:9 screen, because the original aspect ratio is 16:9. Again, don't worry about anything being cut off in the picture though, because the image on the DVDs does not cut anything out of the picture even if on your screen it is playing this way. You will just be viewing a scrunched up image.",1409356800,,1291,4.111111111111111
8341891,5,B001TK80GG,"When this show was on the air it was one of the few shows that my husband & I both enjoyed watching. It combines geography, culture & fun. I prefer this show to the more recent ""Drinking Made Easy"" because it travels all over the world & not just within the USA. It's as if I get to travel along to places I've never even heard of!",1394323200,,331,3.955223880597015
8341892,5,B001TK80GG,"love Zane, love Three Sheets, and the follow up, Drinking Made Easy. this is an enjoyable show to watch from time to time, either to see some cool places and learn about awesome drinks and cultures, or to play along with the drinking game (rules can be found on Wikipedia). highly recommended",1388016000,,292,4.634615384615385
8341893,5,B001TK80GG,"We love this show and the movies,  We watch them all the time.  Fun to watch when you have free time.",1357689600,,101,3.761904761904762
