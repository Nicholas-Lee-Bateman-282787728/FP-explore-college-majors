5839109,5,B00DOZNGT0,"I grew up with Transformers in the house because of my brother Eric, but let me tell you, they have changed a lot since then. Liz hasn't ever been into Transformers but my nephews all love them so I knew this was a must add to our movie collection.  Transformers Prime is the ""newer"" more improved Transformers that kids now days love!

This movie is amazing to watch because of all of the wonderful character interactions as well as fight scenes.  In Transformers we have seen each individual character fight their way through their differences, but in the end the characters finally accept that they are what they are.  Which is a a fantastic lesson to be teaching children of today.  Each character and child are all individuals and we should celebrate our uniqueness and fight till the end.  But because all things end eventually Transformers Prime also ends with this video. For
Transformer lovers everywhere this will be a double edged sword.  They will get to see the series end but enjoy the new DVD at the same time.

While it isn't the original Transformers I grew up watching it is the perfect remake of the old classic.  But one thing is for sure it will keep you on the edge of your seat filled with action packed adventures both children and adults will both enjoy.",1380758400,,1279,4.599118942731278
5839110,5,B00DOZNGT0,"Transformers Prime reignited the spark in my inner child. The series is beautifully done, and this movie encapsulates why Transformers Prime has been one of the best cartoons if not one of the best shows of the past decade. With the fate of Cybertron at stake, this movie treats us to some of the best character interactions as well as some of the best fight scenes to grace this series. The movie is both epic and intimate at the same time; we relish in Autobots continued search of peace and finding a way to restore their planet while dark forces continue to claw and scrape at the Autobots hoping destroy them once and for all. The movie provides a rare thing for most television viewers, and that is closure. We get to see each character grow, mature, or find acceptance in who they are. We see fights come to a bitter end, final acts of desperation, and the emergence of new leaders. When the battle resolves, we are reminded that each person has the ability to transform into greater persons and to rise to causes greater than one's self. And it is on this theme the movie concludes and that's when the credits roll out.",1380240000,5,1127,4.5024390243902435
5839111,4,B00DOZNGT0,"I am a huge fan of Transformers Prime. I loved how Season 3/the series ended. Also I would agree with other reviewers that this is the BEST Transformers series since the original, however I do not agree that this film was on par with the 1986 Classic TF:TM. While Predacons Rising has a solid plot (No spoilers here I promise), I do feel it left several loose ends. If the next Transformers series would pick up where this one ended, I would be ok with that (ala Beast Machines from Beast Wars) however with the next iteration set to be more ""family friendly"" I do not see how that would be possible considering the current status of some characters in this universe. As for the film itself, it is quite entertaining, it is pretty much the self-contained story I always wanted. Also the *absence* of a certain species in this film is absolutely a plus. The ending however was bittersweet. It felt a little like how Beast Machines ended, but executed far better. One thing I will say. --Season 3 left me lamenting the loss of this series, wanting to see it go on. Predacons Rising however (based on its conclusion) reversed that decision for me. Despite the loose ends, I do not need or want to see any more stories told in this continuity. Hasbro has for the first time forcibly caused me to ""move along"" with them onto the next thing and not constantly feel regret for what is , in my opinion, ending to soon. well played Hasbro, well played.",1379894400,17,1443,4.490494296577947
5839112,5,B00DOZNGT0,"Don't worry no spoilers int his review.  This was a dramatic, dark, and actiony movie that really left you on the edge of your seat. You don't know who actually will win good or bad.  The really sad part is that the Prime series is over.  And if you cry, it's normal. Definitely more of an adult movie since the intensity is so high but kids should watch it without problem.  Amazing movie. Though at times it could be a bit oddly paced but that could be overlooked. And this movie is great for KnockOut fans. Just sayin",1379462400,8,520,4.275510204081633
5839113,4,B00DOZNGT0,"An alliance is formed between the Autobots, Decepticons and the Predacons to defeat the risen Zombicon army. There's plenty of action and clashing metal.  In the end, some tough decisions have to be made and a valuable lesson of self sacrifice is learned.  Any Transfromers fan will not want to miss out on seeing this finale.",1379289600,5,326,4.803571428571429
5839114,5,B00DOZNGT0,"I watched a pre-release copy of ""Predacons Rising"" earlier today. It picks up right after the last episode of Transformers Prime, Season 3 (if you haven't watched the series, certainly do that first). And if you are not aware of Transformers Prime, it is the BEST series since Transformers G1.

Everyone hates spoilers so I won't speak of the plot, but I will say that this movie is on par with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Movie/dp/B000H6SY5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers Movie</a>&nbsp;from 1986. The animation and story line are terrific, and it is definitely made for adults (but still kid-friendly). It's also a pleasure to watch it flow as a continuous movie with no cuts for commercial breaks.

Do yourself a favor and buy this. My only regret is that this movie is the finale of a fantastic series.",1379116800,35,880,5.609022556390977
5839115,2,B00DOZNGT0,Season 3 was a complete departure from the well-crafted storytelling and awesome fight scenes choreographed in seasons 1 and 2.  Few things make sense throughout the series and it just seems like the writing was lazy.  That's all I'll say.  Such a let down.,1377561600,2,257,4.795454545454546
5839116,5,B00DOZNGT0,"From what i've heard this is suppose to be an epilogue to season 3.

5839138,1,B00DOZNGT0,"Review by child of Mominator  warning spoilers below

Ok, after the three glowing reviews for the three seasonsPrime went south I am very glad we got this from the library and did not buy it. If youve watched the 1986 Transformers The Movie then you're in for the same sort of death, doom, and destruction of the leaders of the Autobots and Decepticons.

The whole movie felt rushed, I mean you were not able to keep up and almost out of breath. It was exhausting, the TV show you could breath, even if you chose to watch the story arcs all the way through but thisyou were falling downhill with no way to stop yourself. The CGI, actors, everything was the sameif the ending had been as it should have been, then it would have been fine. None of the humans were in the movieI don't think they were even mentioned.

The ending should have been one big fight between Optimus and Megatron  who was controlled by Unicron. Optimus beating Megatron, not killing him, and they live to fight another day with maybe a wounded Megatron fleeing with his forces to the stars to regroupmaybe I could have lived with that. But no, Optimus has to die for the hundredth time!!!!!!!!!!!! Not fair!!!!!!!!!!! I don't care if he comes back in this new TV show Robots in Disguise! Transformers is not Transformers unless Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) is leading the charge against the Decepticons led by Megatron (voiced by Frank Welker).

The only reason I believe that Prime was cancelled is because the Bay-formers people were upset that Prime was stealing their thunder with good clean family entertainmentneed I say more?

I don't advise buying this; rent it from the library or some other service. Make sure youve got a big box of Kleenex and maybe a plush Optimus Prime to squeeze and cry into when you watch the last five minutes. I was too mad to cry when I watched itbut I did squeeze my Optimus Prime toy.

Would this not be great though? If Hasbro goes back and makes a movie (that goes to theaters) that shows the entire story that brings Orion Pax and Megatronus to who they are in Prime. In this movie they show how Wheeljack and Bulkhead worked together in the Wreckers only to end up lightyears apart. Arcee and Tailgate, Bumblebee, Smokescreen, Cliffjumper, Ultra Magnus, Starscream, Soundwave, everyone seen and mentioned. Everything. That would be a movie I would pay to see, how about you? I am going to tell Hasbro Studios about this. Who knows, maybe they might consider it. Roll out fellow Transformers fans!

Be sure to tell Hasbro Studios how much you really, really, really don't like this! Use the picture to know how to contact them. Dont forget to ask when they are going to make another TF show like it! Make sure to ask about Transformers Prime Powerful Alliances!",1493596800,,2785,4.632860040567952

5839173,2,B00DOZNGT0,"This was a very disappointing movie.  The TFP series was really well done.  The writing was solid, the story engaging, and the development of the characters was handled nicely.  So when this movie came out I expected the same.  Unfortunately they got lazy.  Really lazy.  Without adding any spoilers, one character had an about face that just... happened.  I thought they might send him to the Autobots but they could have at least developed it.  Instead they handle it with one line of dialogue.  Lazy, lazy writing.  Starscream was barely even IN the show and he was a fan favorite. The story they tried to tell could have been pulled out into another season but instead they dumped it all into a single movie.  This was a very disappointing end to an otherwise fantastic series. No doubt some idiot in a suit made that decision.  That always seems to happen.",1412812800,2,861,4.666666666666667

My only regret with this is that it's shorter than I'd like. I personally felt that they could have stretched out the plot of this into a few hours. It's just over an hour long, and they throw a lot at you at once. It sometimes feels like they were rushing to end it, but for what it is I enjoy it.",1412726400,,540,4.09433962264151

Truly great acting by veterans Peter Cullen & Frank Welker, amazing animation, wonderful plot twists, & with the absence of human characters in this final installment, you see what a great dramatic series this is.  Predacons Rising also features a surprising turn by one of the main antagonists towards the end which caught me by surprise.

An ancient enemy is hellbent on destroying the newly returned planet, and it will take the combined effort of all Transformers to stop it.

5839220,5,B00DOZNGT0,"Though in some cases a bit predictable. This takes place at the end of third season, ""Transformers Prime"". Optimus and the others finally leave Earth to rebuild their home once more, only to find their problems have followed them back. Shockwave and Starscream have set up shop seeking the remains of the Predacons to build an army to take the planet. Predaking has also returned for much the same reason and has managed to find at least two others that Shockwave had resurrected and has established his power over them, recruiting them to his service. Once they learn about the Predacons, the Autobots try an overture of Peace with Predaking only to be refused, because the Autobots are blamed for wiping out his race, save for two. Bumblebee did managed to tell Predaking the truth, that it was the late Megatron who engineered that incident and had the Autobots do their dirty work for them. Troubles are compounded when Unicron, once defeated on Earth. has managed to arise and return to Cybertron using Megatron's corporeal form to raise an army of the undead Predacons intending to utterly destroy Cybertron and his old enemy Primus once and for all forcing Megatron's spirit into a horrific punishment. Optimus and the others rally to fight the undead army, but it isn't until Predaking and his cohorts arrive that the alliances are formed at last as what few Decepticons also join the side of the Autobots. An ancient relic known as the All Spark proves to be the only item that can contain Unicron's spirit for all time, but, the container can only be used if Optimus fuses the All Spark with the Matrix of Leadership that he carries. Once Unicron disappears, Megatron is resurrected, only this time, he chooses peace and leaves alone. As for Optimus, his plan to release the energy of the Matrix into the planet's core means his own demise, but one that promises life for all. As for Starscream, well, the Predacons have a new target to terminate. This is one when the loose ends are tied neatly and in one last grand battle.

The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that the movie created some questions in its content that were not answered by the end of the film. Specifically, it appeared as though Shockwave died only to be seen again a few minutes later. I think maybe the creative team didn't think this through as the movie gave final closure to the series and characters. Otherwise, it was worth watching.",1392681600,,555,4.196261682242991

The running time is about 1 hour, i expected a little more, for being a movie and the final of the series it is a little short.

Predacons Rising was a wonderful end to what in my opinion was the best T.V. show ever made.  I cried so hard when Optimus Prime died at the end of the movie.  He has been my hero and I must say that I love him to death.  I wish they hadn't killed him, but it was a beautiful example of who Optimus Prime really is and just how much he was willing to sacrifice.  I was also so thrilled that KnockOut joined Team Prime.  He has been a favorite of mine since the first episode he was in!

I always thought Transformers Prime was an adult series because of the violence, complicated story, and the emotional content.  For teens on up, however, this is one awesome series.  And for all you teens reading this, yeah it is seriously cool!  Take it from me, I am a 19 year old girl and I know many Transformers Prime fans way older than me!

I am just so sad that Transformers Prime is over.  They will never be another show like it.

I know apparently it is expensive to design new character digital models or some such, but REALLY!

Also, since this is the end of the series, it would have been nice for a conclusion of lasting peace. I mean Megatron was humble(d), but if he and Prime shook hands and said something about peace talks. Even if Starscream flew away, Shockwave could have seen the logic in this, and it looks like the Predacons were already kind of hankering for peace with the good guys.

So obviously, I was saddened to hear that the show was coming to an end. The final chapter to this epic series is in the form of a movie. But does it do the series justice?

Yes. Yes it does. The series finale, like the rest of the show, has a great story and lovable characters. Unfortunately, the humans from the series do not appear in the movie. It's an all-robot movie. Fortunately, the robots are so well developed, that it's okay. I especially love how Bumblebee gets a starring role in this one, since most of the show he's kind of been a background character. Yes, Optimus is cut out most of the movie, like the Bay films. Except this time, there's a good reason. Optimus must find the All-Spark to revive life on Cybertron (they made the planet inhabitable, but didn't recreate the lives of the Cybertronians). I should note that this movie isn't really a movie, but rather a really long episode. The difference with that compared to most TV movies is that that's a good thing.

The voice acting and music are as great as they usually are. Brian Tyler's epic soundtrack is once again used in the movie, with some new tracks as well. The animation is also great, with the same details as the show. This time, the animation seems even better than the show, with it's greatness being used in bigger places.

There isn't a whole lot of action, which is surprising for Transformers: Prime. But the story and characters were so excellent that I actually didn't care. The way season 3 ended made me want to cry, because I knew that one of the greatest shows on TV was over. The way this movie ends makes me okay with that. It ends in a good way that really can't be continued on from. Though I am going to miss Transformers: Prime, it's nice to know that the show ended on such a good note.

5839317,4,B00DOZNGT0,"Bumblebee (Will Friedle-Voice) and his friends have to save their home
once again from Megatron (Frank Welker-Voice) who has been trying to
take over their world for some time now. While trying to save his
world, Bumblebee encounters some obstacles and problems along the way
and needs his friends to help him through these challenging times. Will
they be able to save the world?

The animation in ""Transformers Prime Beast Hunters Predacons Rising"" is
outstanding with a variety of colors, big characters and lots of
detail. There is a little confusion in the beginning of this film but
by the middle, everything is making sense and it makes for a good
storyline with lots of action. I like the characters' names because
they are very unusual and they are not something I would hear every
day. My favorite character is Bumblebee because he knows when to take
charge when nobody else wants to, knows how to get down to business
when others are afraid, and knows who to look up to that gives him
wisdom and guidance. The transitions of the transformations goes very
smoothly and you can really see them transforming into their shapes,
objects or other things/creatures.

Other voice talent actors are Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) and Steve
Blum (Starscream / Darksteel) who do a great job with their voice
acting capabilities. They really portray their emotions through their
voice, going from happy to sad to angry and back to happy again. It is
all so believable and convincing.

One great message in ""Transformers Prime Beast Hunters Predacons
Rising"" is that you should always keep trying, no matter what and never
give up. It may get hard sometimes and you feel like you want to quit,
but keep trying!

I recommend this film for ages 7 to 15 and people who love The
Transformers. There are some violent, intense scenes with robots
fighting each, but they are really not too scary to look at. I give
this film 4 out of 5 stars because it is a little confusing in
beginning and I sometimes cannot understand what a few of the voice
characters are saying.

All nostalgia for the fantastic G1 series aside, this series has been pretty excellent and one thing is for certain, Transformers never looked so good.

However this epilogue, Predacons Rising, isn't very good. It has a running time of 66 minutes and the contents are not really worth paying $ 15 or more for in my opinion. It is too light. It has a few nice scenes but the whole plot doesn't make much sense and overall the ""film"" fails to engage properly at any point in the story.

My favourite scene is probably early on when Ultra Magnus and Smokescreen get attacked by the two new Predacons in this film ( who are later shown as noticeably inferior to Predaking) and the two Autobots basically get the s*** kicked out of them. The UnicronMegatron creation sounds much better on paper than it is executed in this film. The fight scenes are generally a bit bland.

5839353,4,B00DOZNGT0,"I didn't realize it had the BluRay and DVD both inside. There is no difference in content, and the extras are almost non-existant, with the exception of a video about the studios in charge of making the series and movie. It was a good watch, but I was really hoping for some insight into the movie itself, preferably commentary from the writers or even the voice actors.

The BluRay is beyond beautiful on a large, HD screen. The movie has a few laughs, mostly Smokescreen, who's childish personality seems to have been ""ramped up"" a little, probably to separate him from the more mature Bumblebee, who you should know by now, can talk again (in a voice very similar to Smokescreen). It worked. -_- I'm a fan of Smokescreen and I found him a little irritating a few times, even if funny.

The end made me feel sad, (after initially being a little disbelieving) but it was definitely a conclusion that was up to TF:Prime standards. There was a seriousness to the show, and the end marks a new beginning for Cybertron.

I will say that there were a few times where things happened that were not SHOWN, and I think they should have been. Even in a quick flashback. The show did this a few times, and it didn't feel corny. Without being able to see certain things happen, It made the movie feel a tad bit rushed, or almost like it wasn't planned all the way before they started working on it.

5839357,3,B00DOZNGT0,"This finale to the unique Transformers Prime series I felt was rushed. They could've added so much more content and depth to it.

The story gives some more spotlight time on the Predacons as to how they're going to find and rebuild their race. However, considering the events that played out, it should've been titled ""Unicron Rising"" since the focus was mostly on the Chaos Bringer. The Predacons and their quest was more of a side story.

For those that don't already know, Unicron makes his inevitable comeback this time using Megatron's body as his vessel. What else would he want, but to destroy Primus? His sudden appearance on Cybertron has thrown the remaining Cybertronians ('Bots, 'Cons, and Preds alike) into a tizzy. With Autobots and their newest ally (though his usefulness lies in the comic relief area) are the ones who naturally have the most urge to stop the latest threat. The Decepticons, what few remained, lend their aid in subtle ways.

That is basically the plot for this movie.

I personally felt as though Primus should've made an appearance and had aided Optimus in his battle against Unicron. I can't really call it a battle either, more like a scuffle. It's short, VERY short. There were more intense battles on Earth.

Spoiler alert: I also didn't like the fact that when Megatron finally saw the light, Optimus surprisingly said and did nothing! No offer to reconcile their past friendship, no suggestions for him to stay and undo the damage. Nothing. After all of the battles and encounters, Optimus just lets his former friend fly off into the distance without a word.

I am extremely happy that Megatron for once (maybe the first time ever) turned over a new leaf and wasn't killed off like most of the other series. However, I'll have to resort to imagination as to what became of him in his new life. (Megs is my favorite character.)

In any case, this finale is a great one, but it could've been so much better considering how great the series was. I admit that I wasn't head over heels for TF Prime, but I did enjoy the new take on Transformers very much.

I'm just sad to see that the ending was rushed like this.",1381449600,,2152,4.6596306068601585
5839358,3,B00DOZNGT0,"The good:
Graphics are good, has a great storyline, picks up right were season 3 left off. Has some funny moments and SOME good action.

The bad:
Should have been about 90 minutes long, not 66, as most of the movie was spent laying the plot.  Sound was not as adequate, my surround sound wasn't pounding very hard, or at moments it looked like it should have.  Liar or uhh leader Bumblee (enough said.) Going inside Megatrons head was overdone, though if the movie would have been 30 minutes longer, those moments could have been more spread out.

The Ugly:
The entire movie was spent laying a plot, then the final battle came and went, don't blink or you might have missed it. There weren't any unexpected events in the final battle and it was a lame way to finish the fight. The season finale to season 3 had a better, more unexpected ending than the movie did.

IMHO: SPOILER sort of:

It would have been better if there would have been a twist and a lot more action. For instance, Unicron should have killed Optimus and then just when the audience thinks its over, Primus takes over Optimus's body and the real showdown begins!!!!",1381190400,3,1134,4.507317073170731
5839359,3,B00DOZNGT0,"SPOILER ALERT! I have included spoilers, so don't read any further if you have not seen the movie yet.

I have been a huge Transformers fan for the past six years and have watched Transformers Prime since its beginning back in the fall of 2010 and have loved it with every episode that has been released. I was very satisfied with how the series ended and, when I discovered there was still one more movie (not to mention the first animated Transformers movie since the one in 1986), I could not wait to see it. However, I felt a bit let down after watching the ending to this amazing show.

I will definitely admit that it had its perks. The animation was flawless and looked better than it ever has. Most of the lines and the fight scenes were amazing and the characters remained in character (always a plus). Also, it only had Transformers. NO HUMANS AT ALL!! Which was also very nice to see!

The thing that erked me the most while watching this movie were the many missed opportunities, especially for the older fans (considering this show had many references to the older shows). Here is my list of what I expected:

1) With Unicron using Megatron's body as a vessel, it would have been epic to see Primus come alive through Optimus. Then, a million year old rivalry would have come alive again through the present rivalry of Megatron and Optimus. Not to mention, fans have not truly witnessed Primus himself since the Cybertron series released in 2005-2006. It would have been nice to see the BIG guy again.

2) I did very much like how Megatron finally was able to see the light by witnessing what Unicron planned to do to Cybertron, but I expected Megatron and Optimus's last confrontation to end more like the ending of the Dark of the Moon film adaptation by Peter David.
*SPOILER ALERT*: If you have not read the DOTM movie adaptation, I highly recommend it. The endings between the book and the movie are night and day to one another with the book ending having Megatron and Optimus coming to a truce and agreeing to rebuild Cybertron rather than fighting over it. It would have been nice for Optimus and Megatron to have a conversation about the rebuilding of their newly restored planet at the end of Predacons Rising.

3) It would have been nice to see more Transformers rather than the ones we have been following throughout the entire series. More Autobots and Decepticons who have perhaps taken refuge somewhere upon the planet (maybe in stasis or something) or maybe even hiding out on one of Cybertron's two moons. It would have been nice to see more of the fan favorite Autobots like Ironhide and Jazz, the female Autobots (who, even on a dead planet in the G1 series, still managed to survive), or maybe the other Decepticon seekers like Skywarp and Thundercracker. Having more Transformers would have made the end battle with the terrorcon Predacons that much more epic.

4) The final battle between Unicron/ Megatron and Optimus was... short. So very, very short. They had more intense battle sequences throughout the show: Darkness Rising, Part 5 and Alpha, Omega to name a couple of the episodes. This is where the battle between Unicron and Primus could have been inserted.

My list is shorter than I anticipated, but these are just things that erked me about the movie and this is only my opinion. I am not sure if other fans feel the same way about these missed opportunities, but perhaps I staked my hopes to high before actually watching this movie. I am not trying to write anyone off from seeing it nor am I attempting to change how anyone views it, I am simply stating what I had hoped to see in a series that has done so well over the past three years.",1380931200,12,3688,4.585735963581183
5839360,4,B00DOZNGT0,"The war is over!

After centuries of conflict between Optimus Prime and the Autobots against their ancient enemies, the Decepticons, their leader, ""Megatron is no more!"" The most merciless of the evil Decepticons has fallen, and so the brave Autobots  can at last begin the task of rebuilding their war ravaged homeworld, Cybertron. But other foes await them on the planet of their birth: the war may be won but the battle to defend Cybertron continues in ""Transformers Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising,"" the movie length adventure that brings the ""Transformers Prime"" animated series to its cosmic conclusion.

Picking up from the climax to Season three of the television series, ""Predacons Rising"" opens with the Autobots  taking the first steps to bringing robotic life back to Cybertron. The war weary Transformers hope that refugees of the long, bitter war that devastated Cybertron, scattered throughout the stars, upon learning of the war's end will return home and help in its restoration. But when the Autobots discover signs of life on the planet, they are confronted by new foes long thought dead and the renewed threat of the most evil of enemies, Unicron the Chaos Bringer. The Autobots must battle once more with the future of Cybertron at stake.

""Predacons Rising"" is an almost relentlessly action-packed adventure for Team Prime and showcases these endearing characters for the last time. For this reviewer, it is an enjoyable but regrettable experience. Throughout its three television seasons, ""Transformers Prime"" has been a joy to watch, an epic computer generated version of a great ongoing mythos. The stories and most importantly, the characters have been engaging and entertaining and these traits are dramatically displayed again in ""Predacons Rising."" The movie seems to bring the ""Prime"" story  full circle as the viewer sees a new undead army rise just as we did in the series' premiere adventure, ""Darkness Rising."" A subtle bit of artistry adds atmosphere to the film's drama: The movie opens during a daytime setting on Cybertron, hinting at the hope the Autobots have for their new beginning on their homeworld. But as ""Predacons Rising"" unfolds and its plot grows grimmer, daylight fades to a threatening night. During the film, we the audience witness the comraderie between the heroic Autobot family, the conniving of the surviving Decepticons; Starscream, Shockwave, and Knockout, the primal power of the beautifully designed Predaking, as well as the continued inspiring nobility of Optimus Prime. Regretfully there are plot elements from the TV series that the film does not resolve. This final ""Prime"" adventure could have been a longer length than about 70 minutes. But if there is any real fault with the film it may be the sad fact that it brings to an end a Transformers tale that seems, to this fan at least, to have come to a conclusion too soon. Like any story one comes to treasure, ""Transformers Prime"" is a saga this reviewer wishes didn't have to end. Still, it is worth noting that the creators of this Transformers continuity offered the fans of the show a two-fold finale; the first at the end of the TV series on Team Prime's adopted homeworld of Earth, the second on the planet they fought for so long to restore, the world of their birth, Cybertron. It is gratifying to watch a cherished television series bring its story to a worthy finale.

The Blu-Ray plus DVD Combo Pack also includes a single ""Behind the Scenes"" feature, ""A Look at Polygon Pictures,"" the Japanese CGI studio that collaborated with Hasbro Studios to produce the animation for the ""Prime"" series.

""Transformers Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising"" is a film that is well recommended.

Long live Optimus...and Team Prime!!",1380931200,4,3757,5.076175040518638
