8572840,5,B00BQUHKFQ,"SWEET Movie. It's a kids movie but great for adults, too, about an orphan boy and how he sees Krishna-the-child (who is always animated and the only animation in the film). Great actors. Juhi Chawla and the boy steal the show. Also in the cast is a bit of katrina Kaif and a cameo of Hrithik Roshen. Heartwarming and just cute. This movie was released in 2013. (more recent than I'd realized).
I don't even know much about or have any real affinity for Krishna; as a Westerner who has never read the story of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. But knowledge of or affinity for Krishna or not, this is a Heartwarming, cute, even delightful story that touches the heart and brings a smile with good actors and I liked it a lot. If it was on streaming, I'd watch it right now. Am just looking into buying a used copy/English subs so I can see it again.",1510099200,,844,4.314465408805032
8572841,5,B00BQUHKFQ,I love the story about Krishna and this film does show that story. Yet it shows how Lord Krishna became a child to be friends with a child. How Lord Krishna cared for this little boy the day he was born was well done in this film. The songs were great. I have played this movie many times.,1370390400,,289,4.0
