I bought both of the Costa Rica titles and they are just so relaxing and soothing. I've been putting them on the tv and just leaving them on for hours and they warm my soul on these cold winter days.",1230940800,,347,4.1940298507462686
8194057,5,B000Q36UJ6,"I first want to say that both of the soothing environments DVD's I own are really great, well made products. I find them truly inspiring and relaxing and put them on a lot. I've tried a few different brands of these kind of DVDs and I found these to have the best quality. Each one gives you around 2 1/2 hours of video too, so its like getting 2 DVD's for the price of one.

I wanted to comment on what one of the other reviews here said about frozen skies, lack of wild life and small waves. This DVD has a lot of great variety and every scene is different.  While a lot of the scenes have sort of gentle waves which are typical of costa Rica, there are some really strong waves in a few of these scenes, one with some quite large swells. I would say calling them, ""lap pool waves"" is misleading and inaccurate. There are birds in a few of these scenes, too. It's like a few days at the beach. Sometimes there is wildlife and sometime there isnt. I have no idea what they mean by frozen skies but the skies have really gorgeous colors in these scenes and I was truly impressed with the cinematography. In my opinion that reviewer was just looking for something very specific that I've never seen.

This DVD had several scenes and they're all different so I think that if you're looking for different vibes you cant go wrong with this title.",1206230400,,1342,4.275590551181103
8194058,3,B000Q36UJ6,"So far, the DVD I am trying to find has not been found.  This DVD had lapping waves and some of the sky does not seem to change.  Not much bird life or critters in the sand.  MY quest is to find large swells, bird life and activity in the sand that shows the place is alive.

It is a pretty tropical color but it is not what I am hunting for in a wave DVD.  I bought both the Costa Rica DVD's and I would suggest that you get one to see if it is what you want.",1203724800,,460,3.606060606060606
8194059,5,B000Q36UJ6,"The footage on this DVD is truly stunning. I love the moonlight scene. It's rich and colorful, not a fake day for night shot with the sunlight faking as moonlight. The sunrise at the beginning is amazing too. It was shot in Montezuma, down in the Nicoya Peninsula where I spent a week last year so thats pretty cool too. I just love the DVD. Its really well done, it sounds great too. Sometimes I just leave it on in the background all day. It helps keep my mood calm and focused. Free shipping from Amazon makes it a no brainer. Enjoy!",1184889600,,536,4.264705882352941

Living in NYC and finding it hard to get a peaceful moment, I turn it on while i'm having my morning tea and it just saturates my whole body, and day. I even tried sleeping with it once and found it surprisingly like sleeping next to the ocean, one of my favorite things. I woke in the morning feeling far more rested than usual. The production quality on these is pretty amazing. Enjoy!",1179792000,4,448,4.22093023255814
