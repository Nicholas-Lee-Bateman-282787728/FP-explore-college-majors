If you are not or don't know, again it is a great movie for you to better understand what the supernatural is all about.  I would recommended it highly for however you might feel on this subject.",1171238400,,273,4.132075471698113
8490352,3,B000KKSW9G,"If you're 'into' the supernatural, you'll like this movie.  They deal with spirits as entities and not as 'real people' holding conversations as they walk along (ie Ghost Whisperer, Medium).  It has a lot of elements that are true if you know anything about the spiritual world and how to 'contact' the dead.
