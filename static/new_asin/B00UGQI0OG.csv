8706679,4,B00UGQI0OG,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2017 and directed by David Lister, Malibu Shark Attack chronicles events in Malibu, California, after an undersea earthquake releases several prehistoric goblin sharks to attack the beaches, which is made worse by another quake that unleashes a Tsunami, trapping the protagonists in a lifeguard station surrounded by sea.

Peta Wilson stands out as the seasoned lifeguard involved in a love triangle with two rival men (Warren Christie & Jeff Gannon). Chelan Simmons plays a superficial, whiney beach girl while Remi Broadway appears as the lifeguard she tries to charm. Nicholas Cooper & Sonya Salomaa are on hand as a couple ready to marry.

This is a decent TV-budgeted nature-runs-amok flick with a serious tone and a kinetic first act. The story morphs into a suspenseful confined environment movie in the second act whereupon the main cast is stuck in the lifeguard shack staving off the sharks. The closing act shifts to a reasonably well-done showdown in a flooded basement. The prehistoric goblin sharks are interesting, albeit cartoony CGI, and present a formidable antagonist.

THE MOVIE RUNS about 88 minutes and was shot in Gold Coast & Brisbane, Australia, with establishing shots of Malibu. Writer: Keith Shaw (as Lindsay James).
