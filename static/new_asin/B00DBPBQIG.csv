8591351,5,B00DBPBQIG,"This is the second one I ordered.  First was for my father and second for my ex-husband, both die-hard Steeler's fans. I have yet to watch it but it has to definitely be worth the purchase as it includes the game that day.",1417996800,,222,4.162790697674419
8591352,5,B00DBPBQIG,"As an avid Steeler fan who lived in Pittsburgh during the 70s, this is an AWESOME program which saw on cable TV. THRILLED that Amazon had it!  CAN'T WAIT for the episode about Joe Greene!",1414281600,,187,4.3428571428571425
8591353,5,B00DBPBQIG,"This is good stuff.  The ESPN production seems to treat the subject thoroughly, and in an unbiased manner.  Included is the original NFL Films 'Game of the Week' video of the game narrated by the 'Voice of God' himself, John Facenda (interestingly, the 'Immaculate Reception' had not yet been named as such, and the controversy hadn't reached the heights it has since).  The 'jury is still out' on the legality of the Franco Harris game-winning catch.  The video presents one photograph which does not offer 'unimpeachable proof' that the catch should not have been allowed, but is as close as you can get to that conclusion (which why this event has taken on the qualities of legend).  I'm biased, though, since I love the Raiders.  Judge for yourself.  Worth buying for the extras, and not having to look at video borders and the annoying ticker you see on the NFL Network or ESPN.",1395878400,2,883,4.73202614379085
