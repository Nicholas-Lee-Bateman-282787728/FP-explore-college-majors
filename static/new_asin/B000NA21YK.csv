2763867,4,B000NA21YK,"This is the eighth DVD in the series, and includes four episodes from Season Two of the brilliant children's television series, The Backyardigans.

1. Movers of Arabia

2. Cops and Robots

3. Sinbad Sails Alone

4. The Best Clowns In Town

1. Movers of Arabia (Tyrone, Pablo, Uniqua, Austin)

Tyrone is a Sultan

And he's got a cave of stuff

He needs a team of movers

'cause the job is really tough

A genie in a bottle helps

To speed the job along

They have to learn to say ""I wish""

Whenever things go wrong

2. Cops and Robots (Tyrone, Uniqua, Pablo, Tasha)

Two cops patrolling outer space

Must stop an evil scheme

When robots storm a factory

To start a new regime

3. Sinbad Sails Alone (Tyrone, Pablo, Uniqua, Tasha)

Tyrone is a sailor

And he's going on a quest

To sail his ship to rainbow's end

Because he is the best

Pablo stows away on board

Without Tyrone's permission

The Siren and Medusa skits

Enhance this expedition

4. The Best Clowns In Town (Tyrone, Uniqua, Pablo, Austin)

Three little clowns looking for work

But Tyrone isn't willing

To have them as a circus act

Though they deserve top billing

None of the episodes feature all five characters, with Austin and Tasha alternating, and although each has its defining moments, this isn't the best DVD of the series.  Next up is ""Into the Deep"" which will be released at the end of July 2007.

2763868,1,B000NA21YK,"Compr el DVD porque deca que vena en 3 idiomas y espaol era uno. Ahora que lo tengo en casa, me doy cuenta que slo viene en ingls, vuelvo a amazon para ver que pas? Encuentro que en la ficha del DVD cambi y marca como nico idioma el ingls. Correccin tarda, por parte de amazon.",1181001600,3,277,3.9642857142857144
2763869,1,B000NA21YK,"I bought this DVD only because all press that I previously read indicated ""Save the Day"", my daughter's favorite episode, would be included.  However, ""Save the Day"" was not on the DVD, but instead some episode called ""The Best Clown in Town"".  I don't know why Nickelodeon would choose to omit one of the best episodes they've aired from this new DVD.",1180483200,2,352,4.661290322580645
2763870,4,B000NA21YK,"My 4 year old son *loves* The Backyardigans (and as was said before one of the few kids shows *I* can stand over and over again and I actually LIKE the show), so I have been collecting the DVDs for him and for my 1 year old to watch when he is older.
The episodes are always good, but instead of ""Save The Day"" which I have heard is one of the best, if not THE best episode, they have substituted ""Best Clowns In Town"", a good episode but not the best.
We don't get to watch the episodes that often on TV, so the DVDs help us catch up. I was disappointed that they didn't include ""Save The Day""- it wouldn't have stopped me buying the DVD, but I was looking forward to that episode.
No info on when they will include that story on a future DVD, the next one due out doesn't mention it.  I would have given this 4 1/2 stars if possible, the 1/2 star differnce due to the episode change.",1180396800,,885,4.028409090909091
2763871,5,B000NA21YK,"These episodes are scheduled to air on Nickelodeon starting Monday, March 19th (10:30AM ET).

Surprised that the DVD wasn;t released before the air dates for these episodes. The Legend of the Volcano Sisters was released at least 2 weeks before those episodes aired.

My son loves this show. Every episode sets him off on his own adventures. Highly recommended for sparking imaginative stories in youngsters.",1174003200,19,408,5.2615384615384615

2763880,1,B000NA21YK,I baught this product and it was not even the movie inside it was a waste of time I ended up with Dora episodes sorry my 2 year old son doesn't like Dora. Very disappointed in this purchase not to mention all the scraths on the disc,1361836800,,232,3.9574468085106385

2763883,5,B000NA21YK,This is a great bargain.  All Backyardigans shows are excellent and especially good for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.  The dancing and singing keeps their attention span for the full 30 minutes.,1305590400,,204,5.34375
2763884,5,B000NA21YK,"I'm actually buying this for two reasons:  number one I just saw Sinbad sails alone and number 2 because I haven't seen these other episodes in the tv line up.  The mambo in Sinbad is worth buying the DVD.  I am slowly starting to notice the thinly veiled references to very adult (as in mature, not inappropriate)situations, such as Gotta Dodge, which sounds a lot the games men play with women at times.  Funny stuff! (see my review for Into the Deep re: the song about Tasha and Uniqua's off-limits ""garden).",1276646400,2,511,4.582417582417582

2763888,5,B000NA21YK,"My son is a huge fan of the backyardigans. We recorded the Best Clowns in Town on our media center last July and he still want to watch it at least once a week. I love it too, it's the cutest episode by far!
Sue & Noah",1232841600,,218,3.6595744680851063
2763889,5,B000NA21YK,This is a great DVD!  My little boy loves the backyardigans and the 4 shows on this DVD don't disappoint!,1206403200,,105,4.25
2763890,5,B000NA21YK,I Love the Backyardigans. My daughter is almost 3 and she won't watch anything eles. It has gotten her singing and dacning and playing dress up. The show is really good quality. The kids doing the voices in the show and the songs they sing are by far the best ever in a kids show.,1205193600,,280,4.109090909090909
2763891,5,B000NA21YK,"Mother's, Fathers, Grandparents, & babysitters. The backyardingans provide good learning tips when you share with the child what is taken place. They share, care, get out and explore, and love to dance. My two yr grandbaby luv them and I enjoy watching them with her. They provide music from different backgrounds. So if you like country, rap, soul, pop ect they have it on one of the disc.",1194048000,,390,4.75
2763892,5,B000NA21YK,"My daughter absolutely loves all episodes of The Backyardigans. She is now 14 months old but has enjoyed this show now for about 6 months. It is the only cartoon that is not annoying. In fact, my husband and I are often singing the songs throughout the day with or without her. :) The Singing, Dancing, and colors really keep her interest for the duration of the show if you really need to get some chores done.",1189382400,,411,4.35064935064935
2763893,4,B000NA21YK,I know and sing all of the songs.  Three out of four of the episodes are good.,1186963200,,78,3.588235294117647
2763894,5,B000NA21YK,"In terms of collections of episodes this is one of the best yet. We have fully enjoyed all 4 episodes on this DVD, with Sinbad Sails Alone easily jumping into the Top 5 of all time Backyardigans episodes.... no mean feat. The other three episodes are also of a high standard and I think I enjoyed the Clowns episode even more than my littleone. Highly recommended!",1185667200,,364,4.53030303030303
2763895,5,B000NA21YK,"This one is pretty good. The day we got it my daughter watched ""Best Clowns in Town"" 4 times. We have seen it plenty of times since. She's 3 and my 1 yr old loves to dance to the music.",1185235200,,185,3.65
2763896,5,B000NA21YK,"My son has about a dozen Backyardigan DVD's and videos. He loved Movers and Shakers so much, that it he watched it several times a day for a week! It even re-awakened an interest in his OTHER DVDs, so he pulled those out and watched them, too.

Movers & Shakers features four episodes:

Movers of Arabia - Movers Pablo and Uniqua move Sultan Tyrone's magical things to groovy surf music. But can they do the job without using up Genie Austin's three wishes? This surf rock episode (think Beach Boys!) includes the songs I Am the Sultan, Movers of Arabia, I Wish, and The Genie Bottle (sung to the tune of Take Me Out to the Ballgame).

Cops and Robots - It's a space chase set to jug band music, as Cops Uniqua and Tyrone try to stop Bad Bots Pablonator and T-900 Tasha from turning the galaxy's robots bad! (My son *especially* loved this episode because we had bought the super-cool&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cops-and-Robots/dp/1416915729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cops and Robots</a>
book last fall!) The songs on this episode are Can't Stop the Cops/Bots (sung to the tune of Shoo Fly, Don't Bother Me), We Are Badbots, Steer, Baby, Steer, and I Feel Good.

Sinbad Sails Alone - Set sail for adventure--and mambo--as Sinbad (Tyrone) encounters rough waters, Siren Uniqua and Medusa Tasha! Will bumbling First Mate Pablo help--or sink the ship? Songs on this episode include I'm Sinbad the Sailor, Siren says, Got To Dodge, and Do It Myself

Best Clowns In Town - Silly music plays as Clowns Pablo, Uniqua, and Austin try to impress Ringmaster Tyrone while shuttling him back to the circus in time for the really big show! The circus-like songs in this episode include The Best Clowns In Town, That's Not Funny (to the tune Goodnight Ladies, The Show Must Go On, and At The Circus.

There are also two videos on the 99 minute Movers and Shakers DVD: Into the Thick of It and One Good Turn Deserves Another.

As always, I'm always impressed by the colorful animation, witty dialogue, clever plots and--of course--the tour of diverse music styles. I love that the Backyardigans introduces children (and parents!) to various music styles...some which may not be familiar. A great buy!",1184457600,8,2234,4.97319034852547
2763897,5,B000NA21YK,"...how can you not give it 5 stars?

I couldn't recall seeing these episodes on television, neither could my 5-year-old, and in my opinion, they weren't the greatest episodes (we still like It's Great to be a Ghost better), but she loved them anyway, and she's the reason for the purchase in the first place, so if she likes it, I love it.",1184371200,,339,4.380952380952381
2763898,5,B000NA21YK,Shipping was fast. Product just as decribed. The new pre-order stories are wonderful. My grand-daughter loves them!,1182902400,,115,5.823529411764706
2763899,5,B000NA21YK,"My girls (and I!) love the ""Clown"" episode - very fun and fast paced!  The ""Arabian Movers"" episode is probably the weakest one on the disc, and it's still good.  Even if you don't have all the DVD's (like we do) you would probably want to pick this one up.

TIP: use the ""Chapter Up / Next Chapter"" key on your remote to get by the THIRTEEN previews.  I swear they should start paying us to allow these things into our homes with all the advertisements they put on DVDs these days.",1182211200,,482,4.206521739130435
2763900,5,B000NA21YK,"Four more episodes, as described in the previous reviews.  As usual my sons love them, the songs, animation, and choreography are top notch, and the story lines fun and interesting for kids young and old.

""Cops and Robots"" is the big favorite from this DVD as far as my 3 year old is concerned.  I am sure yours will love it too.

Some previous DVD's offered English and French (why French?).  This one appears to be English only and I would love to see English AND Spanish languages supported.  Not sure why they don't produce them for Region 1 with English/Spanish.

""Can't stop the cops!""",1182038400,,592,4.580952380952381
2763901,4,B000NA21YK,"Just to resolve the controversy over the episodes included:

The bonus episodes are ""Sinbad Sails Alone"" and ""Best Clowns in Town""; ""Save the Day"" will probably appear on upcoming Into the Deep DVD.

My son loves Backyardigans, but this one is a mixed bag. He didn't care for ""Movers of Arabia"", but ""Cops and Robots"" is one his all-time favorites. The two 'bonus' episodes are a novelty right now, but don't seem memorable to me; Tasha appears in the first and Austin in the second.",1181433600,,483,4.670588235294118
