8618756,1,B00FVCUYLM,"This looks to me like the standard definition DVD was just placed on a Blu Ray disc. In fact, this Blu Ray version looks WORSE than my DVD version. Everything is super grainy and it looks like part of the picture has been cropped out in many instances. I am hugely disappointed as this is a great Duran Duran concert.",1446076800,2,317,4.3
8618757,3,B00FVCUYLM,The picture is great but the sound is clear and good but the sound mainly come out of the left speaker center and right are low on sound so when you watch it it's funny to see the singer in the middle but the sound voice comes from the left side,1445385600,,245,3.823529411764706
