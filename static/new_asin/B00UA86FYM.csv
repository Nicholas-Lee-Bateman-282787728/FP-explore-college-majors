I can see why it won tonnes of awards. Its a really refreshing film with two cute and cool characters and its a very real scenario that takes place. I feel like most films don't do that any more.. this film is refreshing in that way. I really recommend it.",1457568000,,399,4.2631578947368425

8704931,5,B00UA86FYM,"I *really* related to this movie - Its my kind of a story and my kind of a  humor.
This movie does not shout at you.. it whispers, and it
earns itself a place in my DVD collection upon release for the sheer fact it matches my 20-something experience to a huge degree, and all the feelings along the way.",1427673600,,303,4.05
