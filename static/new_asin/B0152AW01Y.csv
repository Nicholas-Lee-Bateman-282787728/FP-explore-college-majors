7425620,5,B0152AW01Y,"Wow. Beautifully shot and excellently crafted acting performances. The soundtrack was hollow and new age and used sparingly which only added to the indie style of the film. About the plot, well almost a cult like environment where the participants believe/brainwashed that they are living off the fat of the land but is convincingly done so by the amazing Gregory (Cassel). A slow boiling menace that creeps up as the film develops is portrayed superbly by Alexander (Chabriel) as he continues to try and find morality as he grows into a young man. I won't spoil anything so I will say this: what happens when a child's innocence is forced into depravity, what can come of that even when the best intentions lurk behind that depravity and immoral compass?",1445644800,7,755,4.8604651162790695

7425694,4,B0152AW01Y,"Vincent Cassel stars in this Australian film as Gregori. He has a harem of women who all have children  mostly it would appear  with him as the father. They live in an isolated community where they seem to lead a happy life with the children learning yet enjoying their childhood. Gregori is the only man. His eldest son is Alexander and at first we see true paternal love and the reflected devotion.

However, all is not as it seems as we learn that the outside world is not a nice place and Gregori  is training his children to be hit men or hit kids more appropriately. As Alexander learns more of the world forbidden to him he slowly starts to question what his fathers motives are and their way of life.

Now this is extremely well made being in part made by Animal Kingdom It Follows fame. The actors all seem to be unknowns but all do brilliant jobs of what was a very physical film in terms of what is expected. Cassel is just as good in an English language role as he is in his native French and puts in a stellar performance. The plot was apparently inspired by child soldiers of Colombia. It is a very thoughtful film and despite the violent undertones is actually fairly responsible in avoiding the actual gore but still addressing the issues head on. It has had mixed reviews but I for one found that it stayed with me long after having seen it  which is always a good thing.

7425706,5,B0152AW01Y,"Partisan is a brilliant film.  It works on many levels and is for the serious cinephile, which explains the varied reviews.

Visually breathtaking, Kleiman avoids the typical temptation of presenting post-apocalyptic type settings in drab grays and blacks.  Instead, he uses color adroitly to portray the seeming childish innocence of an isolated world where violence is condemned, yet the young are taught to be assassins.  The directors use of subdued and implied violence was refreshing, yet potent.  Scenes were artfully shot and Kleiman took his time, not rushing the eloquence.  The soundtrack was skillfully arranged, with liberal silences juxtaposed with subtle use of haunting melodies and childrens surreal karaoke.

I usually prefer to avoid attributing symbology to fiction in any form, but couldn't help myself with this production.  As the film progresses, Gregorios beard comes off along with his gentle veneer, and he struggles intensely to maintain the composure of a fanatic in denial of his own dark side.  Earplugs used to muffle the gunshots of the child assassin Alexander are shed to indicate that hes finally listening to a higher order.  The final scene is vividly moving.

This is not a movie for the faint of heart.  It is a powerful representation of how humans can hallucinate a personal reality that sublimates darker intentions, and yet externalizes them in potent ways that defy moral logic.  And do so in a dramatic flourish that violates the innocence of the spirit.  We might look to some world events that mirror this.

7425715,5,B0152AW01Y,"I believe this is the most intelligent movie I have seen lately. There is a lot of content beyond the obvious in this movie. Even when you can see this movie as the story of a strange commune, or a ""coming of age"" tale, it can also be watched as a brilliant metaphor for our 21st century society. There are similarities between the leader of the commune and the apparently benign government of an isolated country. Following the same reasoning, the children can represent soldiers that, in their innocence, do not know the real reasons behind a war and yet participate in it, believing they are protecting their home (in fact, a partisan is someone that is a zealous supporter of a faction, a party or a country, because he is biased by the same strong emotional allegiance that a child feels for his mother --not in vain the word ""motherland""). In this sense, the movie criticizes any killing done ""in the name of the authority"", and defines growing-up as the moment when a person begins to question unethical orders. After watching this movie as a work of anti-war art, you may believe that the story is less about the future than about the recent past, as well as a warning for the present.",1450915200,,1193,4.579439252336448

7425728,3,B0152AW01Y,"I was sucked into this movie after reading the description. I was looking forward to seeing how young children were molded into elite assassins reminiscent of Salt, Hannah, Hitman, etc. Balloon targeting was the highlight.

At first, I thought the city they were in was a former Eastern Bloc slum. However, it turns out that the decrepit buildings and sad scene-scape are actually somewhere in Australia. So much for what I thought Australia looked like.

Because I kept waiting for this movie to ""mature"" I did not stop it... I made it to the end. I'm glad I did; although, my expectation never arrived.

In retrospect, I was disappointed by the storyline. However, I felt the actors, all of them, did a superb job with their lines and characters. If I was a citizen of Australia, since they funded this movie, I would petition the government to stop spending money on ""entertainment"".

The movie wasn't horrible. The movie wasn't good. The movie was just there. The best character was the protagonist boy who only wanted to save the chickens.

However, it's absolutely unreal. Characters don't exist as the people are in this movie. Not even in cult communes. The psychological abuse needed to keep people fixated on the cult leader is constant and verbose. Second, a number of possible locations, perhaps Kosovo in the 1990's or Easter Europe in the Putin era, cannot even come close to anything like this movie. If you like the idea of spending an 1.5 hours watching a character sketch about something that'll never happen in this reality, you'll enjoy it.

I thought is was a brilliant portrayal of a sociopath narcissist  (Gregori) who has up front good intentions to harbor and provide safety for abused women and their children.  However, you learn that there is a cost in this relationship.  The cost is the freedom to make a choice outside the confines of Gregori's ""Utopia"" -- in other words choosing to act on something without Gregori knowing about it..  The women are knowingly and unknowingly imprisoned in this relationship.

Where the story take place, or the mundane details of the society in which he lives, are not as important as the development of his character, which is the focus and intent of the film. It's not a movie for those who cannot recognize evil behind a smiling face, or violence without gore, or enemies without a chase. I did not find it ""slow,"" I found it compelling. This film affected me much like The Pawnbroker, where the plot is not based on action, but rather on a character trying to come to grips with what life has dealt him.

There is much here for those who can look beneath the surface. The final scene is left intentionally ambiguous, but if your understanding evolves along with the boy's, you will have a good idea how it ends.",1449446400,,890,4.460122699386503

7425738,5,B0152AW01Y,"Australian director Ariel Kleiman's first feature film shows lots of promise for great things to come from the young director. It's a gripping coming-of-age tale set after an unspecified apocalyptic event has occurred in the presumably not-too-distant future.

Vincent Cassel gives an excellent performance as Gregori, a charismatic leader of a small commune, that consists of Gregori - the only adult male, and his small band of mothers and their children. Gregori teaches the children that it is a dangerous and evil world outside their encampment. He trains the children in class and through play to act as cold-blooded assassins against the commune's designated enemies in the outside world.

Gregori is a complex character, full of genuine love and concern for his flock of followers. He is husband, father, leader, teacher and disciplinarian to his small tribe. He offers protection and comfort to them from the perceived dangers and insecurity of the immediate world outside the commune. At the same time, there is a dark side to him, and Gregori has a gnawing sense of insecurity that manifests as anger on those rare occasions when his authority is questioned or his orders not obeyed.

Surprisingly, the threats to his authority come from a couple of the children, not any of the adults. Alexander, an eleven year old boy played by newcomer Jeremy Chabriel, looks up to Gregori as both a father figure and hero. He is obviously a favorite of Gregori as well. But the boy is not above a little mischief now and then, and develops a slow but growing sense of independence. Over time Gregori falls off of the pedestal that Alexander has set him on and the boy begins to question the wisdom and integrity of his mentor and guardian. This creates a growing tension between the two that leads to a falling out between them.

I really enjoyed watching this movie. It's not a fast-paced thriller, but rather a character study of young Alexander and his relationship with Gregori. I enjoyed the thematic clash of authority versus individualism, and the growing tension between the two main characters as Alexander matures and begins to doubt the truthfulness and morality of all that he's been taught. The tension only increases as the boy determines that he must become the protector of his newborn brother against all potential harm from his immediate environment. As for Gregori, he is torn between his obvious love for the boy and his need to remain the undisputed and unquestioned leader. All cannot end well as long as the two are at odds with each other.

The movie is purposefully ambiguous about the cause of the apocalypse, where it is taking place, and also of the reasons Gregori sends the children out on missions to kill their victims. This did not detract from the effectiveness of the story at all for me. I did feel that the young actor playing Alexander was perhaps trying to fill shoes too big for him as his performance came off as a little wooden to me. However, it may be that this was part of the director's design to help show how the boy had been trained to be a cold-blooded killer to carry out his missions. There is obviously some violence in this movie, and although disturbing because it is carried out by the youngsters, it is infrequent and not especially gory. It is very suspenseful watching the man and boy as their very warm relationship at the beginning of the story gradually grows cold and they become emotionally distant. The resolution is only determined in the final scene. This is a different and intelligent story that I hope gains a large and appreciative audience.",1449446400,3,3611,4.836569579288026

Some people might even think it's boring, but it's actually one of the best movies I've ever seen. It does require some thinking and intellect, though. It's about the dangers of isolationism, and the futility of messianic utopia in a dystopic wasteland. It's explores the personal struggle of how people, in such a predicament, can ambiguously be both hero, and villain. It has an amazing electronica soundtrack, full of ambient melodies, and melancholic adagios, composed by Daniel Lopatin, a.k.a. Oneohtrix Point Never. Plus, a little synthpop karaoke, which seems to act as the film's only source for comedic relief, where it's otherwise entirely absent; by the likes of members of Metronomy, All Seeing I, and Sbastien Tellier.

The film was well acted. My interpretation of the film is through a psychological approach. The city in which the events take place is both desolate and oppressive. A man goes about bringing home stray women who are basically psychologically damaged (victims of abuse) to his home. Which is a commune type compound he created out of rubbish and the damaged throwaways from society (much like the women he collects). He raises their children and spawns a few of his own since he is the only adult male on the premises and being the complete control freak he is; everyone obey's (or they disappear). No one holds down a job, they wear face paint and work in the garden all day. The source of the money he uses to support his clan is disclosed about half way through the film. Although,he may profess non-violence; he is indeed a criminal. He uses the oldest male child as a ""hit man"" to kill various people who are targets. It is through those acts that they are able to survive (financially).

The rest is up for the viewer to watch.  I won't tell you the ending. I gave it four stars for the acting.  The story was tiresome.  Having lived through the 60's and early 70's I still don't like male dominated communes. Especially, when one egocentric male dominates the whole show.

7425961,4,B0152AW01Y,"Don't be surprised if the first half hour of Ariel Kleiman's remarkably atmospheric and diabolical thriller, Partisan, leaves you off-balance. That seems to be the point conjuring up as many unanswered questions as possible, creating a mental fog that disrupts the senses. Who is the mysterious, charismatic man in the maternity ward who both seems to belong there and yet, strangely, does not seem to belong there? Why does he have such a control over the woman about to give birth?  Years later, why is he the only grown up man in a community of women? And where in the world is this isolated, rocky commune located?

Partisan's greatest achievement is dropping the audience into a world of peculiar construct and providing little in the way of a lifeline. Kleiman, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sarah Cynglar, keeps information at an absolute minimum, which as it turns out is exactly how it should be. Commanding our attention from the very beginning is the great Vincent Cassel as Gregori, the leader of what can only be described as a cult. When we first meet him he's overseeing the birth of Suzanna's (Florence Mezzara) son, Alexander (Jeremy Chabriel, a solid match for Cassel), who grows into a strong, inquisitive 11-year-old boy. Unfortunately, being inquisitive isn't seen as a virtue in Gregori's realm, in which he's the only fully grown man surrounded by women who worship the ground he walks on. And yet there are dozens of children of various ages, all being trained in the art of assassination. Gregori sees to it personally, rewarding the kids for their murderous proficiency with treats and parties. But he has no patience for those who question him or his knowledge of the outside world.

While a fascinating sub-set to explore, the film is slow to introduce conflict, but when it does the tension burns hot. Alexander begins to change his outlook on life when a young boy trying to protect a chicken becomes the target of Gregori's wrath. As Alexander asks more questions, Gregori is forced to assert his authority in harsher ways, but Kleiman never depicts him as outright abusive or even as an evil figure. There's gentleness to Gregori that one can see as calming. He does seem to genuinely care about his charges, who he believes he is protecting from a cruel society on the outside. Even if his ideology is fractured and completely skewed, Gregori still comes across as somewhat sympathetic, a tremendous feat that can only be accomplished with an actor as skilled as Cassel.  There are moments of light-heartedness and normalcy, which only underscores how screwed up everything really is.

Shot in Eastern Europe's haunting, abandoned block structures in Georgia, one gets the impression these people are living in a kind of ghost town. How all of these people, who appear to have come from different regions, could have possibly come together under Gregori's command. Another mystery is whether the outside world is really as decayed as he wants his followers to believe, or if it's a carefully crafted lie.

It's rare that a filmmaker has the level of confidence shown by Kleiman, who never feels the need to guide us through Partisan point by point. This is a tremendous first effort, and if it's a sign of things to come then we've all got something special to look forward to from him.",1448323200,12,3322,4.881205673758865
7425962,5,B0152AW01Y,"Thought provoking and incredibly well acted by the two main leads, Gregori and Alexander. Best to watch this without reading any spoilers as discovering exactly what is going on as it unfolds but to give a brief description it is the tale of a young boy named Alexander who lives in the compound of a cult led by Gregori, a charismatic and charming man with numerous children with many different women in the compound who keeps them sheltered from society who raises them and teaches them a certain skill set. Alexander is coming to terms with growing up and events unfold between the two. This is the kind of film that has tension building from the get go. If your looking for a blockbuster action action or drama, look elsewhere.",1447977600,,731,4.630769230769231

7425964,2,B0152AW01Y,"I couldn't work out what was the backdrop to this story, where were these events taking place?  The blurb on the DVD cover and websites like this doesn't tell you, it says it's origin is Australia, but we're clearly not in an Australian city, the sound-stage for internal compound shots maybe, but the buildings, the cars, their number plates, that accents, we're obviously not in Australia or North America or the UK either for that matter.  Characters are speaking English but that's probably because the film maker assumes we don't want to read subtitles. Originally I thought this was a post nuclear war, zombie outbreak, virus wiping out most of the population type world, due all the grey dull dirty buildings in the background.  But clearly there is still a functioning city here with a commuter train going by in the background, electricity, a large functioning hospital and other indicators of life.  Is this supposed to be set in a current war zone that has been going on for the lifetime of the kids in the film?  Who knows? It's confusing, and you're thinking you'll find out as the film goes on, but even once you get to the end and the film is over, you've still got no idea.

Basically the film follows events through a young boy whose grown up in a compound with his mother, as well as other mothers and their kids who are his age or younger.  If there have been older kids than him that aren't there anymore, we the viewer never know. What else he and the other kids have been  groomed to be by the only male adult in the compound, who at the start of the film we saw approach a new mother in the maternity ward and bring her and the baby back to live with the others, we never find out either. But we do see him and other kids train for with paint guns and go outside the compound with bullets and recreate the phone book searching by The Terminator, only instead of uttering the words ""Sarah Connor?"", before they say yes and are blown away by a shot gun, they confirm their name, are told they are receiving a delivery from their aunty, with that something being a bullet fired from a hand gun into the confused person's face.  Why the kids are being trained to do this or who these victims are, who they work or worked for, like everything else we are kept in the dark, and never find out.

So even though you never know where this is taking place, why the kids are groomed and trained, we do see what the grooming process is like and experience some of it through the main boy. Along with some bad karaoke song selections of what look like 80's songs that never made the charts being used as reward. As are gold stars usually a reward for much younger children.  We along with the boy see the anger on the cult leader's face when a boy of similar age questions his facts and threatens his image to the children as the wise one, when he makes a remark to the children that nothing can grow in their garden in Winter, when that boy corrects him and gives examples of plenty of vegetables that can.  We later see how he deals with that boy when he locks himself in with the chickens after witnessing one get killed for dinner when confused about what extinction means, believes is going to happen to his fowl friends.

If you knew the purpose of the cult and a bit more information on what else went on there, even in the minds of the adult women, the film would have been more satisfying.  Also knowing when and where this is supposed to happening would have allowed you to get more into the film rather than trying to work that out.  The extras on the DVD are much better than the movie, well one is. Compound Diaries is very cleverly done with different kids to the actors in this movie answering questions in the style you've seen kids do in TV interviews answering something the way naive kids do that adults laugh at. Instead of something like how does a plane fly? It's a parody of those shows where obviously the viewers are adults who aware of the training and missions or who did it when they were kids. The questions are things like what do you do if you shoot someone twice and they still get up?  It's interesting and a little disturbing, especially the African boy who plays with a gun like it's a toy and risks accidentally shooting himself constantly, and even tries to shoot the interviewer when he gets embarrassed but obviously hasn't been trained how to use the gun yet or it doesn't have bullets.",1445644800,6,4436,4.411260709914321

If you have ever been around members of cults, you may recognize some of their common antics that are expertly brought to the screen by the cast of this movie. I would hang this movie poster in my house with pride, and my wife might just let me, because she liked it, too.

SPOILER ALERT:

If you can't decide what happened in the end, look at the cotton in that baby's ears.",1492300800,,541,4.4
8732359,5,B0152AW01Y,"Gut wrenching and riveting psychological drama of a god-like sociopath in his secluded utopian cult and a child, unwittingly indoctrinated to kill,  who finally dares to confront  the patriarch regarding his sick ideology, after a life changing experience !  For the record. This is not a movie made  to entertain the general public, it is a movie intended for clever viewers  how like to -think, analyse and interact with the plot-.  There are basically to types of movies: those you watch for no good reason, just for the viewing pleasure  and those in which you use your brain to think and feel.  Partisan is the latter!  An excellent psychological ""thriller"".!  Unfortunately, it has been extremely down rated.  Indeed,  it is not a waste of time, it is slow pased for a purpose. It is disturbing, because the average public thinks of movies as some magical, cheesy, moralistic, high action, Hollywoodian nonsense.  This is not the case with Partisan, it reveals the dark reality of a decadent society and the methods for survival for a disturbed, messianic emotional blackmailer, and of how his ideals backfire at the end. And by the way, the last scene of the movie is mesmerizing; very common in foreign films. They have open endings and  they leave the interpretation up to the viewers' thoughts and imagination.  Not the typical  sweet eased  -happy end- of most hollywood's productions.  Watch Partisan  with an open mind and try to put yourself in the shoes of the  characters and what their lives must be like. I'm sure, you'll enjoy the experience of a profound and fascinating  5 star drama.",1490745600,,1605,4.892193308550186
