8627406,3,B00GTSVM54,"Jade (Laurie Love) owes the wrong people money. They kill her new bar tender husband and leave her for dead. She vows revenge and gets help and training from Hammer (Fred ""Spearchucker Jones""Williamson) former Viet Nam sniper. After a 10 minute music montage, Jade is a trained killer going after her assailants, each of which has their name painted on a bullet.

This is a low budget grindhouse with some camp value thanks to the inability of Laurie Love to deliver her lines and make us believe she is a fighter. There is no character build-up prior to the killing. It is a simple revenge flick, rather poorly done and with ample nudity, the main attraction to the feature, plus the head and body explosions with blood splatter.  Bad guys are into heroin and strip clubs, I think you get the idea.

1 or 5 stars depending on what you want from a film.

F-bombs, sex, nudity (Laurie Love, Amari, Gabrielle, Louise Kay, Brittany Madrid, plus others including Windy West-thank you.)",1397865600,3,981,4.719298245614035
