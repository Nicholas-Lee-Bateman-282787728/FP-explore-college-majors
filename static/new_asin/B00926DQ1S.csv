5243186,1,B00926DQ1S,"The people who made this movie must not have small children. Many of the topics are inappropriate and the imagery is too visceral. I wish I'd checked these reviews before renting because I agree with all of them.

And besides finding the content deplorable, the production values are lame. Feels like it was filmed 30 years ago, and even then it would have sucked.",1363910400,13,364,4.6875
5243187,1,B00926DQ1S,"Kids and Family????  NO WAY.  Only if your last name is Munster.  Do NOT let any child watch this movie.  Within 15 minutes a toothless transient-looking Peeping Tom scares the teenage boy that was first shrunk and transported to the Tiny Kingdom.  Then the teenager goes into the town and approaches a woman standing with her back to him.  When ""she"" turns around, she has no eyes or eyebrows, only a whistle in her mouth.  Other eyeless characters start blowing their whistles.  THAT IS WHEN I TURNED IT OFF.  It scared my 8 year old.  I could not get to the OFF button fast enough.
Ridiculous Movie.  Have no idea what is in the rest of it or how it all played out, but I could care less.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.  IT WOULD ONLY BE APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TEENS TO WATCH.  If I could have rated this one ZERO stars I would do so!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1362873600,19,856,4.30188679245283
5243188,1,B00926DQ1S,"I concur with other reviewers this movie is definitely not for kids. Not sure who this movie would appeal to either because its not scary in a good way. It has disturbing looking characters but looks like one of those cheesy 80's movies with cheap sets and low budget. But that was the first 15 minutes of the movie, I had to turn it off. It scared my children and it was just too silly to keep watching.",1362873600,8,404,4.1923076923076925
5243189,1,B00926DQ1S,Despite appearances this movie is NOT for kids - I had to turn it off about 15 minutes into the movie and that was really 10 minutes too late.,1362787200,18,142,3.9310344827586206
5243190,1,B00926DQ1S,"It's probably an interesting movie with interesting symbolism, but it's certainly not a family movie. I had to stop it after 10 mins. Now I hope my kids won't have nightmares tonight! Yuck!",1362182400,13,189,4.757575757575758
8534635,1,B00926DQ1S,"I just received this dvd in the mail. When I saw the advertising insert for movies I would never let my kids watch, (or even watch such stuff myself), I had doubts about the dvd, even though the cover looks like a childrens movie. I came here to read the reviews and will not be watching this movie.
I believe the cover art constitutes deceptive advertising.
I wish I had read the reviews before ordering-will do so in the future.",1515715200,,430,4.3875
8534636,3,B00926DQ1S,Like so many movies we watched when we were younger we found it wasn't like we remembered.  We figured if we had liked it our grandchildren would like it but after watching it again we figured that removing peoples eyes and having them walk about town with whistles would be too much for our young grandchildren to handle.  It gets 3 stars for good adult political satire.,1438905600,,372,4.537313432835821
8534637,5,B00926DQ1S,"As you can tell from the other reviews, this movie is awesome!!",1410220800,,63,4.333333333333333
8534638,2,B00926DQ1S,I watched it hoping it would get better.  I was not impressed and had a hard time finishing the movie.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  It was ok but nothing to get excited about.,1390694400,,186,4.111111111111111
8534639,1,B00926DQ1S,"I had a sense of foreboding when the preview before the movie was bad.  I found it confusing, poorly written and boring. The actions and motivations of the characters were nonsensical and boring.  The most interesting character was the villain and he was acted over the top.  But, that was better than his cardboard companions. The eyeless people and man-dog were creepy and disturbing.

Oddest of all, my 9 year old son liked it. I think it's because it was better than going to bed on time.",1373328000,,492,4.620689655172414
8534640,1,B00926DQ1S,I would give this less than one star if I could.  I was fooled by the cute cover and description of the movie.  My 11 year old was so upset by this he was screaming turn it off!  Very disturbing movie. There should be a warning and rating to reflect this!,1372982400,,255,3.9607843137254903
8534641,1,B00926DQ1S,This is a rereleased movie from 1998 that should have been left in some movie vault to die.  Not for kids! Mystery science theater couldn't help this picture.  Stay away!!!,1372896000,,172,4.7
8534642,1,B00926DQ1S,"My eleven year old daughter picked this from the redbox thinking it might be a good movie. Where do I start? The teen sister ""likes hurting"" her baby brother and when he asks her why she likes to hurt him, she says ""I don't know, I just get angry sometimes, being a teenager is hard."" Seriously? The older brother is a coarse, self-absorbed apathetic, not caring if his younger brother is hurt in front of him, and the youngest brother is a pathological liar. The entire movie is about parents leaving their kids alone for some unknown time period. A creepy man stalking the older boy through the street, a kingdom where people are stamped with an ID number on their arm (as in Nazi era) and are surgically mutilated so that they will do a job they are assigned. ""Perfection"" is a man being cut up and dog jaws inserted into his mouth and then placed on a leash to track other human beings, another man being mutilated and having his eyes and mouth sewn shut... many people having their eyes removed, and the ""leader"" choosing to have part of his brain removed so that he could act without compassion or caring. This is a very disturbing movie that no young child should be exposed to, EVER. Whoever rated it G are perverse and evil people who should NEVER be allowed near young children. In fact, the makers of this movie clearly have some really sick ideas of what young children should experience.",1372723200,6,1400,4.515748031496063
8534643,1,B00926DQ1S,"Creepy, creepy, creepy!  Not for kids! Watched the whole thing in hopes of finding a redeeming moment!  It never happened!  The only good thing from this movie is that it's over and my kids now understand really bad writing, characters, and plot!  The Tiny Kingdom must have had a tiny budget and tiny talent available!  Do not waste your time or creep your children out with the no eyed mutant people!",1371686400,3,402,4.605633802816901
8534644,1,B00926DQ1S,"We actually watched this from start to finish with my kids. It was unbelievably bad. And yes, very creepy characters like eyeless people and ""dogs"" that are really mutated people. But aside from the creep factor, EVERYTHING about this movie is terrible. The acting, the story, the script, the special effects. Even the music and how it's used is awful. The story does not make sense and has countless holes of logic in it. Why the heck Redbox is including this in it's limited offering is beyond me. They must have signed a deal with the devil. Don't be fooled by the quaint description of A Tiny Kingdom. It sucks in a massive way.",1366588800,15,632,4.552631578947368
