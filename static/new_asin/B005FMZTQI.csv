8470302,5,B005FMZTQI,"Absolutely recommend to parents of pre-ballet and ballet 1 students who need to practice at home. Stretches and barre work included. My girls had to take a break from their ballet classes for a year. This was a wonderful DVD for them to get back into routine and continue to practice at home. That said, adult participation is required, i.e. a parent needs to be a teacher too for this DVD routine to work well.",1405900800,5,411,4.493333333333333
