8290185,5,B001CW9FDI,"A sex-comedy that features the very beautiful and profoundly sensuous celluloid-goddess---Adriana Vega in a constant state-of-undress is just what the doctor ordered!! And that's exactly what we get, ample time where one gets to take in her physical feminine perfection. Ok, enough of the hype and on with the show. ""El liguero m&aacute;gico"" (""The Magic Garter Belt"" from 1980), was directed by the ""granddaddy"" of the Spanish sex-comedy---Mariano Ozores, who made about one hundred of them in his long and prolific career.

Somewhere in Spain, in 1875, 'Alicia' (Adriana Vega), inherits a supposedly haunted stately-mansion, along with a vast sum of money, some hidden treasure, and an insane household that wants to scare her away. So she enlists the help of 'Armando' (Andr&eacute;s Pajares), the executor of the estate and, soon enough, all hell breaks loose along with the aforementioned bits! There's a hunchback (doing his best Marty Feldman imitation), a mute servant-girl, a wolf-man, etc.

Listen, when a sex-comedy gives you ample opportunity to marvel and gaze at the beautiful and sexy bodily-forms of: Silvia Mir&oacute; (woman who seduces 'Armando' in the first 5 minutes of the film), Adriana Vega, Alexia Loreto, all with FFN, consider yourself lucky! And, believe it or not, the film is pretty funny too. Enjoy, I know I did.

The DVD picture and sound quality is very good, its been digitally restored. PAL format, Spanish (no English subtitles), FFN, NR 90 mins. (BTW: it's available through Amazon.es.)

Love and Peace,
