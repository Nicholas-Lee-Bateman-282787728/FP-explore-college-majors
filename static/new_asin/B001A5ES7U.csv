3445631,4,B001A5ES7U,"Hollywood Hotel has plenty of action--and terrific swing music especially with Benny Goodman and His Band in tow! The plot moves along pretty quickly although they could have edited out some footage; at times the plot has too many complications. The acting is very convincing with the exception of Mabel Todd who plays Dot Marshall, the kid sister of famous Hollywood actress Mona Marshall (Lola Lane). Mabel overacts and director Busby Berkeley should have told her to tone it down; watching Mabel do the role of Dot Marshall gets on my nerves. On the other hand the cinematography is excellent and the choreography works very well.

When the action starts, we get that remarkably famous, timeless ode to Tinsel Town entitled ""Hooray For Hollywood"" performed by Benny Goodman, his band and some musicians who were born to ham it up by belting out this tune! We quickly discover that the band is at the airport to give a send-off to their saxophone player Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell). Ronnie has a ten week contract with All Star Studios in Hollywood and although Ronnie doubts he'll reach stardom he's pretty excited anyway.

Once in Hollywood, however, things don't go so well for poor Ronnie. The big Hollywood star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) is frantically planning her big appearance that night at the Hollywood premiere of her latest picture with co-star Alexander DuPrey (Alan Mowbray), but when Mona finds out that she has lost the coveted role in the upcoming movie production of ""Bitter Night"" she throws a huge tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere. All Star Studio head 'B.L.' Faulkin (Grant Mitchell) tries to convince Mona that she's too good for ""Bitter Night"" but Mona boycotts the premiere. The studio itself panics and hires a Mona Marshall look-alike named Virginia Stanton (Rosemary Lane) to pose as Mona Marshall--and then they hand-pick Ronnie to escort the person he thinks is Mona Marshall to the premiere.

Ronnie becomes smitten with ""Mona,"" who is, of course, really Virginia; and they begin a romance that gets complicated by misunderstandings and more. Eventually, at least some things gets straightened out even though Mona has them both banned from All Star Studios.

Other things can go wrong; and so the plot can go anywhere from here. Ronnie finds work as a singing waiter at a drive-in coffee shop; but when a director at All Star wants Ronnie to dub songs for Alexander DuPrey there could be trouble and heavy politics if Mona ever finds out that Ronnie is back at All Star. How did Mona get her way about having Ronnie banned from All Star in the first place? Moreover, what happens when Virginia poses as Mona, picks up DuPrey at his home and takes him in her car supposedly to the Hollywood Hotel for a radio show appearance? What about ""Fuzzy"" (Ted Healy), the man Ronnie hires to be his agent--will ""Fuzzy"" do a good job and get Ronnie work? Watch the movie and find out!

Some of the best moments in the picture come when we are treated to seeing Benny Goodman and His Band perform both at the beginning and closer to the end of the picture. They do a rousing rendition of ""Sing Sing Sing"" and Frances Langford appears as a singer for Raymond Paige and His Orchestra. Great! Louella Parsons plays herself in this film. The other songs, including ""I'm A Fish Out Of Water,"" are generally quite sweet and they come throughout the film.

The DVD comes with a few extras. We get a Porky Pig cartoon and another bonus feature that has some vaudeville act footage. There's also am extra bonus that features Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.

Overall, Hollywood Hotel is a fine motion picture that suffers a bit from too much going on at once. I think Warner Brothers wanted to turn out a wild, jam packed full of action film with well written, snappy lines but they overdid it; the plot suffers from an occasional manic spell every once in a while. It remains one of the better films from this era, though, and I do recommend it for fans of the actors in this film and director Busby Berkeley.",1236211200,3,4034,4.72972972972973
3445632,4,B001A5ES7U,"I love Hollywood Hotel! It's a wonderfully silly, typically inane Dick Powell musical that's missing only Ruby Keeler. It has little in the way of plot, but it has Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wilson, and Harry James. The BG Orchestra plays ""Sing, Sing, Sing,"" and the Quartet plays ""I've Got a Heart Full of Music."" These come at about the 78 minute mark, and are worth the price of admission.",1229731200,2,414,4.684931506849315
3445633,4,B001A5ES7U,"""Hollywood Hotel"" was maybe the last of the big budget musicals from Warner Brothers in the thirties. The cycle was running out of steam, particularly when the Hays Code censorship removed the sting in the screenplays and finally when Dick Powell, fed up with playing singing ninnies, left the studio. This one is based on a radio show of the same name, hosted by Hearst gossip columnist, Louella Parsons. The film is a spoof of stardom with Lola Lane playing a temperamental star and Powell trying to get a break. As farce, the film is quite amusing, the highlight being the hilarious performance by Alan Mowbray as a ham leading man. He steals the film. Here are some points to note:

- Rosemary Lane plays the ingenue opposite Powell. Lane has charm to spare and a spirited presence but her trained soprano does not lend itself to the pop tunes. Her singing voice grates.
- the songs from Johnny Mercer are not memorable with 2 exceptions. Both ""Hooray for Hollywood"" and ""Let that be a Lesson for you"" have bouncy arrangements and dynamic visuals with Busby Berkeley flying around on his boom. The lyrics are tossed around too and this really makes them energetic and entertaining.
- Benny Goodman's band appears and Harry James solos some choruses.
- Louella Parsons grins her role, sure determined to convince us she is a nice person, which she was decidely not.
- Ronald Reagan and Carole Landis are clearly visible in bit parts, the former as a radio announcer and the latter as a hat check girl.

The print is in great condition and there are quite a few extras. The short film with ventriloquist Edgar Bergin and puppet Charlie McCarthy is typical dated fare and the technicolour short on Scottish poet Robbie Burns is horrible although the colour is preserved well. It is hilarious to see the arid California country doubling for rugged Scotland. The cartoon is good fun with Porky Pig in an imaginative fantasy which manages to tie into the film and its songs cleverly. The original trailer is of unusual interest too because it contains a chorus of Frances Langford which does not appear in the film (you can see where it has been cut when you view the film) and an alternative take of the finale.

The DVD is best value if purchased as part of the second set of the films of Busby Berkeley.",1226534400,14,2304,4.656019656019656
3445634,4,B001A5ES7U,"Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) is a saxophone player in Benny Goodman's band, but Hollywood is calling. He has just been signed to a short term trial contract there, so off he goes to a world of luxury and extravagance. He checks in at the Hollywood Hotel where the famous Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) is staying. He is even selected to escort her to a premiere, but trouble arises when Mona's temperament prevents her from attending. At the last minute, a lookalike named Virginia (Rosemary Lane) steps in and no one is the wiser. Ronnie quickly falls for his date, unaware that she is simply a waitress with a beautiful voice. And is Mona mad when she finds out her doppleganger is running around town!

The story is silly and the music isn't overly memorable, but there is something about this film that is truly enjoyable. The sets are fabulous and so very art deco. The cast abounds with notable faces from gossip columnist Louella Parsons to vaudeville talent Ted Healy to big band icon Benny Goodman to fast talking Glenda Farrell. Songs like ""I'm a Fish Out of Water"" and ""I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star"" are sweet and light, just like the film. ""Horray for Hollywood"" is the obvious standout, a good commentary on the ways of Hollywood.

Hollywood Hotel began as a radio show. In the mid 1930s, Parsons used her influence on many top notch stars and coerced them to appear on the radio program. Powell was the master of ceremonies and all of the action took place in the Orchid Room which is also featured here. In reality, no such place existed, but Hollywood constantly got calls from tourists hoping to reserve seating there. Unfortunately, only four episodes are known to exist today and of those four only two are in circulation among collectors. This film is not an accurate representative of the radio show, but it is the closest that most people will get to it.",1221955200,7,1873,4.63855421686747
3445637,4,B001A5ES7U,"OK, the movie is OK. But I bought it for the very best version of Benny Goodman's ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" with the very best version of Gene Krupa's solo. I don't think that Gene does it the same each time he plays it, but this version is THE one to use as the standard. This one is far better than his performance in The Benny Goodman Story. In the Gene Krupa Story, the song didn't even get played -- go figure. I play drums, so it was worth the price to own this version. If you're not into drums, then maybe you should pass.",1430352000,3,523,4.038461538461538

3445639,5,B001A5ES7U,"I gave this 1937 Warner Brothers Picture ""five gold stars"" for two reasons. First, it is a fast-paced, funny and full of entertainment- from start to finish. Second, the film ""Hollywood Hotel"" (Busby Berkeley Production) captured the mood of the United States in 1937 with songs and lyrics that kept the audience humming and whistling, and it portrayed on screen from our American radio sets that popular Friday evening star-studded radio program bearing the same name. The story line...Dick Powell who is a member of an orchestra starts on his way from St. Louis Airport to Hollywood for fame and fortune, only to find himself in a case of mistaken identity between a famous motion picture actress and a young waitress. The premiere showing took place on Friday evening, 31 December 1937. It was a year that America established new aviation records, and in his second term in office our President Franklin D. Roosevelt brought back the confidence America needed to survive against the Great Depression and the overtures of those aggressor nations overseas. The picture represented the lively attitude Americans felt when they celebrated at night clubs, stage shows, parties, high school proms; especially on Saturday nights at the college campuses. It captivated a new generation of teenagers and young adults who began listening, tapping their shoes and singing along inside local theatres. Two big bands were featured as specialty acts: Benny Goodman & His Orchestra, and Raymond Paige & His Orchestra. Catchy tunes matched with magnificent settings, with a swiftly paced inside story of the Hollywood life-style. Warner Brothers presented their best star-studded cast led by Dick Powell, and cordially invited our Ms. Louella O. Parsons (International News Service columnist who plays herself in this picture) as an honored guest in her first film role. Although the 10th Academy Awards did not include this picture, ""Hollywood Hotel"" brought into our homes that big-hit song we enjoy to hear as we watch the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presenting the Oscars to our favorite stars- ""Hooray For Hollywood"" (music and lyrics by Richard E. ""Dick"" Whiting and Johnny Mercer).",1391299200,,2191,5.2272727272727275

3445645,2,B001A5ES7U,"From the packaging, I was expecting something of a faded print of the film, so I was very pleasantly surprised to find a very sharp, very clear and beautiful rendition.  The sound came across very well too.  I wish I could be so enthusiastic for the story but, hey...

The movie opens with the great old ""Hooray For Hollywood"" sung by Frances Langford and played by the Benny Goodman orchestra, in what has to be the most rousing version yet done.  Dick Powell is ushered off to Hollywood as a saxophonist under contract for $100. a week(?) and is put up at the old Hollywood Hotel, which in grand Hollywood Movie Style is about five times the size and ten times more glamorous than the original structure ever dreamed of--once you go through the doors.  From that point on, everything goes wrong and Powell doesn't really get his chance till much later in the film, and even then it's a stretch, and by Hollywood standards for pulling our leg, at that.

But, while the story may have you yawning, Benny Goodman and company keep you hopping.  A couple of slow, romantic numbers serve as interludes to a soundtrack that is otherwise some of the hottest swing and jazz from the era, with Gene Krupa taking it out on his drums so fast the camera can only barely keep up with him.

This barely makes the list of the great Busby Berkeley musicals, aside from the music.  There are none of the great, kaleidoscopic dance numbers whatsoever.

You do get some outdoor shots of pre-war Hollywood, although, ironically, almost everyone in the film has been forgotten--Dick Powell was probably the biggest known of all the main stars, although fans of old films will recognize some of the co-stars that made careers out of character acting.

And, if you pay attention, you'll see a skinny Ronald Reagan!

One more piece of trivia:  When Mona Marshall enters the lobby with all of her dogs, about midway though the film, she calls out to ""little Strongheart"".  The real Strongheart ( a german shepherd taken from Germany after WWI) was a film contemporary of Rin Tin TIn and has his own star out front of the Capitol Records bldg. in Hollywood.",1300492800,2,2132,4.63563829787234

8276067,2,B001A5ES7U,"I always wonder what movies the Amazon reviewers have watched in their lives that would make them give something like this a four or five star rating. It's just a bunch of forgettable songs strung together on a really flimsy story. There is one memorable song--""Hurray for Hollywood""--but the main singer in the number is so freakily strange you want to turn away or close your eyes. The one bit of plot that might have been developed interestingly was using the waitress as a double for a famous star, but that story line fizzles out early on. Busby Berkeley directed, so why didn't he include any of his fabulous over-the-top production numbers?
Still, I always try to find at least one little thing that's worth seeing or remembering, and in this disaster it has to be Louella Parsons, who looks and talks just like Edith Massey. She's the egg lady in an earlier incarnation! I especially like her scene in the Orchid Room when she's wearing a formal and jewels that are truly worthy of a John Waters wardrobe choice.
But really, people, don't bother.",1433462400,,1054,4.702702702702703
