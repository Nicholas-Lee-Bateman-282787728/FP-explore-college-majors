8258087,4,B0015DIEL8,"This is a review for the ""B"" western, CAVALRY which was
released by Republic Pictures in 1936.

I'm not sure why but CAVALRY is a fairly elaborate film
for the ""B"" western genre.  It might have been because Republic
Pictures, a brand new combination of older ""B"" movie companies
like Lone Star, wanted to get things started with a bang.

And I'm guessing that's what happened with CAVALRY.
CALVARY was directed by movie veteran R.N. Bradbury and
stars his son who went by the name of Bob Steele.  The two
of them worked with each other from the early 1920s  so they
probably knew what was expected and were able to do it with
little or no problem.

As to the story, Horace Leeds, played by Hal Price,  is out to set up a new Confederacy on the west coast after the Civil War. It's up to government man Capt. Ted Thorn, played by Bob Steele, who's sent west to protect the new telegraph wires,  to put a stop to the lawlessness and give the  country  a chance to unify at last.

CAVALRY is a well made film, a western made when there really weren't many
westerns made for adults and as I said before, a film with a fairly high budget, although some stock footage may be found padding things out
in the movie.

Over all I rate CAVALRY an enthusiastic Four Stars and I certainly wish
they had made more like this one in the mid-thirties.",1284681600,,1334,4.334677419354839
