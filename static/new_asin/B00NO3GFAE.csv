6673319,4,B00NO3GFAE,"This is one of those classic, carefree adult films from the late 70's. A time before so many female performers began trashing themselves with dozens of 'tramp stamps' (tattoos) and everyone and their grandma began shaving 'down there'. A time when many of the adult film producers still knew how to put together a decent, funny film with a good cast, and all without resorting to scenes inserted just for shock value and the cast spouting profanities at every opportunity.

The legendary John Holmes runs a pizza joint with some VERY special delivery girls...Shakey, Gino, Celeste and the newcomer from Alabama, Ann Chovy (yeah, I know. Corny. But there's a lot of humor like that in this one). It's never explained how the customers are wise to the set-up, but depending on how they order their, um, 'pie' (pun intended) they get more than just a pizza. Another in-joke..the girls were deliberately given names that sounded like popular pizza chains of the time, including Shakey's and Papa Gino's. A trio of good ol' boys, led by Paul Thomas, are heavily invested into fried chicken. After sampling what the pizza girls have to offer, they realize they're up against some serious competition. They hatch a plan to dethrone pizza as the local fast food favorite by employing the use of the notorious San Francisco Night Chicken, who begins assaulting the girls by luring them into an old shed. You never see the actual attack, the girls just come staggering back to the pizza parlor looking disheveled and spitting feathers. The sex scenes are nicely done, including a couple of threesomes and brief girl-on-girl action.

I won't tell you how it ends, but it will leave you laughing. It was a pleasure seeing this movie again after so many years. The transfer was nice, but not perfect. It tends to have a grainy look at times, but the colors looked right and the sound was fine. There were many exterior scenes, and I got a kick out of seeing all those classic cars of the 70's. The passage of time has been far kinder to the female cast than the males. John Holmes was at the peak of his career, and was already beginning a downward spiral into an increasingly dangerous drug addiction. He ended up prostituting himself to men and women, and allegedly engaging in criminal activity, to make money for his drug habit. Less than 10 years after 'Pizza Girls', Holmes was dead at 43 from AIDS. Paul Thomas continued on in x-rated movies until becoming a director/producer some years later. Ditto for Candida Royale, who eventually started her own production company to do adult films geared more for female viewers and couples. She was truly gorgeous in this film. The director, Bob Chinn, appears as John's partner, helping out in the kitchen. Laurien Dominique (who played Shakey) passed away in 1986. And then there's Desiree Cousteau. Every once in a blue moon, I see a girl who just looks too cute, too wholesome, to be doing x-rated movies. Desiree was one of them...Candy Evans is another that comes to mind. Desiree seems to have faded into obscurity. Rumor has it that she went back to school, earned a degree, and is currently a practicing psychologist. Could you imagine getting HER as your therapist??? In his interview on the DVD, producer Damon Christian claims money from the mob was used to finance the production.

All in all, this an entertaining film and anyone who collects or is into vintage adult movies will enjoy this.",1419120000,20,3441,4.78956228956229
6673320,5,B00NO3GFAE,"I remember this film from over 30 Years ago when my then partner, now wife moved in to our first flat. We thought it was a very funny, cheesy (pardon the pun) adult film, then on video, and enjoyed watching it.
We have lost the original video many years ago but I was pleased to see it still existed on DVD which to be fair is the only format we can play films on today.
The product arrived very promptly in time for my wife's valentine day present and the quality was a bit grainy but over all very good and it was a pleasure to see Ann Chovy, Mr Blacky and of course the infamous John Holmes back in action back in the day. I would recommend it to anyone.",1362960000,5,657,4.022900763358779

8679420,4,B00NO3GFAE,"This is a solid remaster of a late 1970's Classic

Originally released on dvd by VCX on August 2007
The first release by VCX is a bit rare and out of print I honestly doubt it looks this good
This re-release is a legit digital remaster that is the only way to go if you want to see a crisp and clean print of the film
This remaster is also Region Free
includes: Theatrical Trailer
and a exclusive/new interview with Producer Damon Christian (which is very cool and interesting)
It's a shame the dvd has no other extras

Cast include early pioneers that changed what Adult was
Bob Chinn, Candida Royalle, Christine DeShaffer, Desiree Cousteau, John Holmes, John Seeman, Laurien Dominique, Paul Thomas

WE DELIVER!This is a comic look at the fast food business and rates one of Damon Christian`s best films ever. John Holmes operates a pizza delivery service that adds very special toppings provided by the delivery girls - Desiree, Candida, Chris and Laurien. But Paul Thomas and the fried chicken people enlist the aid of the infamous San Francisco Night Chicken to Drive the Pizza operation out of business. The sex scenes are exceptionally ludicrous in this very entertaining classic adult movie.

This is a legit classic that should be lumped in with other classics like Debbie Does Dallas, Deep Throat, Devil In Miss Jones, Behind The Green Door
If the only adult Companies you can name are Internet Studios this isn't for you
This was the era that started everything it's a must have and deserves a spotlight
