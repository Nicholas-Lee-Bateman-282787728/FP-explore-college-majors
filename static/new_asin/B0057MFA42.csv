A nice mix of early stuff, some b-sides (haven't seen Been A Son, but they were spot-on with their performance of Aneurysm) and key tracks from Nevermind.  The video and sound quality are excellent - it looks like it was shot yesterday, rather than 20 years ago.

then I can watch that band. I hope they don't suck.

Wal-Mart's website didn't specify the format and I was hoping it was the DVD because of the reported issues.  However, the blu-ray came, but I experienced no problems playing it through my PS3 on my Samsung LCD TV.  Either the manufacturer fixed the issue or it is hardware dependent.  Having no surround sound system, I initially watched on the stereo mix but also went back and played a song on each of the surround mixes to see if the problem was specific to one mix.  All mixes played correctly for me.  The show itself is great as many other reviewers have said.",1449273600,,735,4.785714285714286

4597040,5,B0057MFA42,"The thing that gets me  about this concert and Kurt Cobain is how he's playing perfect guitar for these songs, these revved-up punk/grunge songs, while he's jumping up and down, falling all over the place, spinning about like a man possessed. I loved Nirvana on the records but I never thought of Kurt as a great player or anything. I mean he was good for the songs but I never considered him up there with the guitar greats, until I watched this dvd. I never seen anyone play guitar like that in my life, and I seen over 100 shows since the early 70s. The rest of the band kicks ass too. A great concert, all their best songs up until that point of their career. I like this better than 'Live at  Reading'. A must have for every rock  fan.",1432425600,,740,4.23404255319149

4597042,5,B0057MFA42,"If you have any interest in Nirvana at all, this concert film is a must-own. The band plays in their hometown on Halloween just a month after the release of ""Nevermind"". I'm saddened I never got to see these guys perform live, so this is the closest I can get. A strong setlist with tracks from the first two albums plus some obscure cover songs. The performances are intense, powerful, rough and yet polished and professional. It's amazing that they were able to coax such a huge sound out of such spare instrumentation - one guitar, one bass, and one drum kit. Kurt doesn't say much in between the songs - bassist Krist Novoselic provides most of the stage patter - but he instead speaks through his singing and guitar playing. Dave Grohl shows what an amazing drummer he was, he really pounds on that drum kit!

As for the technical aspects of the disc - it was shot on 16mm so it's very grainy as it should be. The sound is excellent and makes you feel like you are right there in the audience. Before I watched this, I read the reviews on here with many users claiming the audio is out of sync. I looked very closely and honestly, I didn't notice any problems. I'm not sure if the disc was fixed and quietly re-issued. I'd be curious to know if those claiming problems with the disc saw it themselves or noticed it after reading about it on here. The lip movements during vocals were all spot-on and the same goes for the drumming. The most common complaint seems to be that the drumming is out of sync during ""Aneurysm"" - Dave is really pounding the drums fast and furiously during that song so I can see how some people may have convinced themselves it's out of sync. I'm not really sure - I know some will accuse me of having bad eyes or ignoring the issues, but I watched very close and everything seemed spot on to me.",1429401600,,1828,4.360703812316715

You don;t put a shot gun n your mouth and pull the trigger which was barely reachable and no way he wasn't nodded out and posed that way by some devil.

Of course, it's not the ""Mtv Unplugged in New York"", which is definitely their best show ever, even acoustic.

Otherwise this is a great recording of an excellent performance.  Price is a little high, but it has that in common with all Blu-rays.  If I'm allowed to edit this review, I will change it to 5 stars if the manufacturer ever fixes the audio sync issues.",1388102400,5,518,4.637362637362638

Nirvana's music still rules, if you appreciate good concerts then get this DVD. It's unacceptable that the BLU-RAY version of this concert's audio is out of sync that's why I bought the DVD version.

This is either a terrible production or the audio and video are from different shows.  If the audio is from a different show then that needs to be disclosed. This product is unacceptable.

Just drums, a bass, a guitar and the best cigarrette damaged voice your ever hear. Oldschool rock how its supposed to be.

4597071,5,B0057MFA42,"This Blu-ray concert, Nirvana: Live at the Paramount, is an absolute keeper for any Nirvana fan!  It was recorded a month or so after the release of Nevermind--way before Nevermind's success got the better of Cobain and his live performances started to suffer.

The video quality was better than I expected--especially since the concert was originally shot using 16mm film.  The grain from the film is noticeable, but definitely not objectionable.  The 16mm film may not take full advantage of the Blu-ray format, but the concert still has significantly more detail and resolution than a standard definition DVD.  The sound on my DTS enabled receiver was awesome!  Every portion of Grohl's drum kit (every cymbal hit), the vocals, and Kurt's guitar, was clear, clean, and punchy!!

Note: If you've been reading the reviews for the Blu-ray version of this concert here on Amazon, you'll notice a LOT of people have been having problems with the video being out of sync with the audio.  My local retailer was aware of the problem and said he would offer me a store credit if it didn't play properly on my player.

4597083,4,B0057MFA42,"A brief note before I begin this review. I did not come across any technical issues with this disc. I may have just been lucky enough to receive a ""good"" copy, but I won't be bringing any of that up during the review.

Most spent Halloween night of 1991 at parties or at home catching a marathon of horror flicks. But for a lucky bunch of fans at the Paramount in Seattle, it was an evening of rock delivered by one of the most well-known and influential bands to come out of the 90's. That band was Nirvana, and this Blu Ray disc captures the concert in high-def goodness.

Stringy blonde hair covering his face, Kurt Cobain gives it his all. Screaming into the microphone, one can truly see the passion he felt for his craft. Krist Novoselic interacts with the audience between songs, and Dave Grohl is very impressive as he hammers away on the drums with an intensity that would later shine through when he became the front man of the Foo Fighters. It's a thrill to see these three musicians doing what they love. They are at the top of their game here, making this concert an invaluable snapshot of Nirvana Mania which swept the nation over twenty years ago.

The setlist is solid. Most of the band's biggest hits are performed, including ""Lithium"", ""About A Girl"", ""Breed"", and the radio staple ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". There's even an early version of ""Rape Me"" towards the end of the show, a song which would be included on the In Utero album a few years later. There are also a few surprises thrown in. The bizarre track from their debut record, ""Floyd the Barber"" makes an appearance. It fits in well despite its disturbing lyrics.

I really enjoyed the cinematography of this concert. Much like Nirvana's music, the camera work is very exciting. One often feels like they are on stage with the trio due to the use of interesting and fluid angles. The high definition transfer adds to this. While there is a large amount of grain, the picture is detailed and impressive, especially during close-ups. The sound is well mixed as well. The roars and cheers from the audience are loud and clear, as are Kurt's vocals and all instruments.

In the extras department, this disc has nothing to offer. It's a disappointment. A documentary about this show or some music videos, maybe even a commentary by the surviving members of the band, would've gone a long way. However, the concert itself is so satisfying that this isn't a big issue.

Over two decades since the filming of this show and eighteen years since the tragic suicide of Cobain, Nirvana remains a band with a large and passionate fan base. Their music touched a generation. With a sarcastic attitude and angst-filled lyrics which youths could embrace, Nirvana was a breath of fresh air in the music scene at the time. Even those with a passing interest in the band should pick up this Blu Ray. It's a fantastic concert, and watching it cap off with Kurt swinging around his guitar like a madman on a stage bathed in red lighting is an awesome sight to behold.

Some say the grunge movement died with Kurt, but that special moment in rock history is forever immortalized with this disc. Highly recommended!",1334534400,2,3171,4.621669626998224

Carved it on the chalks to the point it annoyed my teachers. I say it again. Nirvana Rules. Awesome concert. Bluray video quality is good enough (a bit grainy) but still worth the buy. The only complain is that I feel the audio and video is not totally synchronized. I notice this clearly when watching Dave. I hear the snare sound miliseconds before he actually hits it. It is not a major problem but considering this is a musical performance, sound and video precision should be given priority.

HOWEVER, This is still totally worth the purchase.

4597088,1,B0057MFA42,"Unfortunately, it is true.  After waiting 20 years for this concert to be released, Universal has given us an unwatchable Blu-Ray.  The concert itself is amazing.  The video and audio are, on their own, fantastic.  But they're out of sync.  It varies, and certain camera shots are OK.  But much of the time, you hear a cymbal crash notably earlier than you see Dave hit it.  Or you hear Kurt slide from one note to the next a moment before he actually does it.  If you're paying any attention at all, it quickly becomes unwatchable.

The DVD is apparently fine, and while the quality won't quite measure up to the Blu-Ray, having it in sync is more important than the uncompressed audio and higher resolution we could have on BD.  I haven't picked it up yet, but that's the only option.  Don't buy the Blu-Ray.  Universal denies there is a problem and says it's the fault of our equipment, but nearly every review of the Blu-Ray is negative.  It's clearly a defective production.",1327363200,6,979,4.589595375722543
4597089,1,B0057MFA42,"Don't let the Director/Producer/Manufacturer reviews fool you into thinking that the BD doesn't have sound syncing issues.  This isn't a simple customer correctible firmware fix and more than likely your equipment is NOT at fault.  You can prove it for yourself by simply putting on two or three familiar concert BD and comparing the results.  If your other concerts don't have syncing issues, ...guess what?

I have literally hundreds of video concerts on DVD and BD.  None of my other BD concerts display synch problems.  Why should this one?

The manufacturer says update your firmware, check the settings and empty the cache.

Folks, this isn't a cache problem, it's a CASH problem, and those who already have yours aren't likely to part with any of it in order to recall discs with an authoring problem.  So, it's YOUR fault and will continue to be YOUR fault because after you've paid for the product it's easier for the Director/Producer/Manufacturer to blame ""faulty"" customers than to step-up and fix the problem.

My suggestion: if you want to see this concert without the syncing issues (and it is a good concert which makes this all the more frustrating), you're probably better off buying the DVD, ...and be sure to get the word out on this BD.",1327104000,16,1257,4.859154929577465
4597090,2,B0057MFA42,"This is the best you will ever hear or see Nirvana. It's a shame that when the two are combined everything is completely out of sync. It's amazing to see Dave Grohl bringing his hands up to crash the cymbals when you've already heard the crash, or to hear Kurt Cobain start singing while he's still a few feet from the mic and hasn't opened his mouth yet. (And to clarify, I've tried all three included audio tracks, and they all have the same problem.)

I only gave it two stars rather than one because it's definitely quite playable as a live audio disc; the music all sounds spectacular on its own.

Long story short, as someone else already said, this Blu-ray is an A+ and an F at the same time. The audio and video are amazing; if only they could be synced up. This release is a travesty. Whoever mastered this and whoever gave the approval for the production should be fired, and it's incredibly disingenuous of UMG/Geffen to blame end users for these issues.

Kurt was a great on-stage presence in his own unique way. He kind of kept to himself while things went crazy around him. He appearantly liked circumstantial irony. When a guy falls off stage after jumping up, first he's concerned for him, but when he sees he's OK he looks down like, ""What did you expect?""

And their cover of The Vaselines' ""Jesus Doesn't Want Me For A Sunbeam"" is really awesome. I just bought it on DVD because I don't have a Blue Ray player, and I don't really care about Blue Ray. DVD's were awesome when they first came out. I don't see anything wrong with them. Plus people say the sound and picture on this concert are out of sync on the Blue Ray version. Oh yeah, and somebody said in their review that their DVD had extras on it. Well, the extras are only on the version that comes with the Super-Deluxe 4-CD + 1-DVD box set.

The picture is grainy, but that's the film. The production is basically not there, just film the concert, leave.

It's a decent show, mostly covers and bleach songs with some Nevermind sprinkled in.

All in all okay, decent picture (upgraded to 16:9 but avail in 3:4 as well) and sound even without the 24/96 -- though there's no noticeable difference between the pcm and dts.

As for the bonus 4 Nevermind promo vids, unfortunately are not on the stand-alone release of this show, which is kind of baffling but only means a market ploy by the companies. Anyways, on to the review..

This show is absolutely great! Filmed on Halloween at the Paramount Theater in Seattle 1991, this show is a great example of Nirvana's intensity live, right on the brink of exploding. Nevermind had only been released a little more than a month after this show was filmed, but you can almost sense the sound of revolution this band and this genre was about to make on the music world. In some ways, this show displays some intimate moments, one being a hometown show and that the band was still in the somewhat early stage of their short years as a band. Songs like Floyd the Barber and Love Buzz are great somewhat nostalgic trips, while Breed and 'Teen Spirit usher in what would be a tidal wave of genre-defining rock. The video presentation is excellent, you can choose wide or full screen, and the sound is a great 5.1 surround sound. As for the CD version, unlike the Reading Festival, is not as heavily edited down, so if you do spring for the may I say, excellent box set, it is a great addition. Overall, this is a great show if you're a Nirvana long-time fan or just novice looking into the group and why they are still being praised today, this show surely shows why.

On a side note, if you're a Blu-ray loyalist, I would wait until the issue is taken care of before purchasing it, which I feel it will be soon enough if enough fans speak up. It'll be worth the wait.",1317945600,,1754,4.410493827160494

You hear Dave hit the snare almost a full second before seeing it.  It's just inexcusable.  And no, it isn't my player or receiver.  I have watched countless other blu-rays on the same equipment and not a single one of them had audio/video sync issues.  I tried watching the BD in every sound/visual combination possible.  They were all the same; just bad.  I couldn't even finish it.  I put in the DVD that came with the super deluxe edition just out of curiosity.  Sure enough, there are no sync issues at all on the DVD.  The audio and video are in perfect time.

I'm with others that hope that there is a recall and reissue of this.  I was really looking forward to this on BD and now it's just going to collect dust, unless Best Buy will let me return it.

4597109,5,B0057MFA42,"A little back-story.....living in the Seattle area I had heard a few nirvana songs off the bleach album but honestly wasn't really that familiar with the band. Many of my in the know friends however, kept hyping the future release of Nevermind and I remember a few attended the record release party. So the day the album came out I stopped by the record store after school and picked up a cassette copy (was 17 at the time).... listening to the album cranked up through my walkman absolutely blew my mind and would be the  soundtrack of my life that fall season.

I attended this show about a month later and was right up close to the stage. It was an absolutely electric performance and you could just feel it in the air that you were witnessing something special. I was so stoked that this show had a proper full DVD release other than the few teaser clips as seen on live tonight sold out! The sound and picture quality are phenomenal and all the sights and smells all came rushing back like a trip down memory lane. I feel they were at their peak and this was the greatest time to witness Nirvana and be a fan....It was right before they started exploding into the stratosphere and getting overexposed and dare I say becoming clich&eacute;. They start to lose that exuberance that makes them so special and future performances seem more labored.

This show was partially responsible for my indie punk / underground music scene obsession that would last for years.

It represents that moment in time in Washington State where nearly every late teen / 20 something was in the same consciousness and doing the same things -

* Going to thrift stores and smelling like patchouli
* 100+ mile road trips to see bands you thought mattered at some hole in the wall dive
* Hanging out at small indie record stores and scoring that hard to find colored vinyl
* Working that bummer job to fund your music collection and hanging out.
* Sharing a big dilapidated house with a bunch of your punk friends
* Vintage instruments and gear was actually affordable for your dream of being in a band and touring in a broken down van.
* Staying up all night at greasy spoon diners with your friends drinking copious amounts of coffee trying to figure out the meaning of it all...(no internet! Actually had physical contact with people instead of virtual!)
* The damp, rainy dreary weather....and so forth

Kurt Cobain lived all these things himself and had an uncanny ability to transfer that whole vibe that generation X was feeling into musical form. That's what makes Nirvana and particularly this show so iconic.",1317340800,16,2598,4.624728850325379

The band is firing on all cylinders, the sound in the venue is great, and the atmosphere/audience is energetic. In addition, the video transfer is breathtaking and the audio mix is solid. Sounds like an A+, right? welp, the audio and video are OUT OF SYNC with one another. The DVD is in sync, but the blu ray is out of sync! completely inexcusable! The blu ray should be re-called/re-released because this is an otherwise stellar product.

UPDATE: The above review was for the same product listed on this page (nirvana 10/31/91 blu ray), but the copy I initially purchased was from best buy (this blu ray was a best buy exclusive and was released by B.B. months ago). I returned the blu ray to best buy because it was defective (A/V played out of sync on a litany of different systems...including every blu ray/tv set up inside of the best buy store). Point is, contrary to the garbage stated by the manufacturer about this disc being perfectly fine, ITS NOT. PERIOD. I just received my copy from amazon today (1/12/12). I was hoping that the manufacturers had quietly corrected the glaring audio/video sync issues on the latest batch of blu rays that went out to amazon and other retailers etc. THEY DID NOT. Bottom line: the performance contained within this blu ray is amazing! the audio mix and the video transfer are both fantastic! However, the fact that the audio and video are unacceptably out of sync with one another makes this blu ray unwatchable. Of note: it appears all dvd copies of the show are correctly produced/sync'd and all blu ray copies of the show are defective (out of sync). DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BLU RAY UNTIL THE MANUFACTURERS CORRECT THEIR MISTAKE AND RE-ISSUE THIS RELEASE! amazon should send their copies back to whoever it was that pawned off defective merchendise onto them (UMG? Geffen?). 2 stars for the amazing musical performance. 0 stars for the defective blu ray and the deceptive lies told by the manufacturer.

Quote from UMG/geffen etc:
""Please note that great care was given to ensure a quality Blu-Ray disc was created. Audio/video synchronization playback issues have not been replicated at the manufacturer or releasing company testing facilities on multiple players.""

PLEASE!.... then those involved in this process are either remarkably stupid or liars (or both).

8460891,5,B0057MFA42,"No audio sync issues on my Samsung UBD-K8500 UHD Blu-ray player and Marantz SR7010 receiver. Looks amazing! One my biggest regrets is not seeing Nirvana live, and after seeing a few crappy cover bands, I have to say this is the closest I'll ever get, and while the crowd energy is missing, this makes me feel like I'm *almost* there.",1483660800,2,333,4.566666666666666
8460892,5,B0057MFA42,No sync issues. Play this loud and it's the next best thing to actually being there. Great live set. Current bands can't compare to the raw yet melodic songs that Nirvana have on display here.,1474848000,,192,4.514285714285714
8460893,5,B0057MFA42,"This live concert of Nirvana on dvd rocks. Sure, they play a lot of their poppier songs in the setlist on this one, and I would have preferred their weirder and angrier songs, but it's still really enjoyable. And they do make up for it by playing On a Plain, Territorial Pissings, and a killer version of Endless Nameless at the end of the show.

Not much else to say, the quality of the video on this thing is amazing. Though it was filmed literally 25 years ago now the video is so high quality that it looks as if it could be from this year.",1474848000,,544,4.132075471698113
8460894,5,B0057MFA42,"Nirvanas live shows are just great!!!! These guys sound like a insane Punk Metal band in their live performances!!!! If you like the album versions for their songs, you gotta check their live stuff!!!!",1463875200,,201,4.9411764705882355
