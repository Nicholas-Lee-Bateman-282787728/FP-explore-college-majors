7922727,4,B00004TJGM,"To be perfectly honest, I was a bit disappointed when this came in the mail, because it was the subtitled edition. Yeah, Ranma 1/2's dub is actually good (except for the very beginning, that stunk)! Plus, I find the dub to be a bit funnier. However, this is still great, and is worth getting.

Basically, Ryoga gets a mark on his stomach that makes him the ""Strongest Man on Earth"". However, the mark...is one of the most laughable things I have ever seen. As a result, Ryoga wants Ranma to beat him in order to get the mark off. It gets insane, like most Ranma episodes do.

Overall, this tape is worth getting as it will provide plenty of laughs!",1309478400,,648,4.391666666666667
7922728,5,B00004TJGM,"Sounds a little weird no? Well, in this movie he thinks he will be.  Desperate to beat Ranma, Ryoga has a martial arts master tattoo his stomach with the image of the ""battle god"".  It supposally makes him  invincible against any opponant.  It would be fabulous exept the fact that  the tattoo shows up on p-chan too, and it doesn't look to ""cool""  to begin with.  This movie is a hilarious continuation of the already long  list of ranma movies!  I loved it and give it 5 stars and two thumbs way  up!",960595200,,502,4.301075268817204
7922729,5,B00004TJGM,"This is a very funny tape. It's a two part episode,and once you see the first episode you'll want to see what happens next. You'll be laughing the whole way though it. The main character is Ryoga. It's all about how he  gets this strange tattoo a.k.a Mark of the Gods, and the problems it  causes. Ranma tries to help Ryoga get rid of the tattoo, and Akane almost  finds out P-Chan is Ryoga. This is one of the best Ranma videos to own.",948585600,,436,4.166666666666667
