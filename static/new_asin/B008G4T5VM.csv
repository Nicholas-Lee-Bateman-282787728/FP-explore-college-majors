All of the wrong turns movies pretty much the same bad guys but different ways to Die & get chopped up
it had  a good beginning & a Good end as they left it open to make another one
for me this series for wrong turn can never get old.",1350518400,3,316,3.579710144927536
5159279,5,B008G4T5VM,This sequel was alot of fun and had some great practical effects. Mean spirited kills and a great campy vibe overall. I recommend this film to any fan of the Wrong Turn franchise.,1350345600,5,179,4.454545454545454
5159280,5,B008G4T5VM,"Loved ALL of the Wrong Turn series, but as much as people disagree, WT 4: Bloody Beginnings has to be my favorite so far. The men Sean Skene, Dan Skene, and Scotty Johnson who play the 3 Hilliker brothers and the actors who play the young Hilliker brothers put so much personality into their characters. I love the movie all-together, kind of more corny than the other 3 due to the acting on some of the other actors, but the Hilliker brothers are why I am in love with the movies. Especially 4. They show more on them, their love for each other as brothers, their personality, same old gore, suspence, and humor.",1346976000,8,613,4.433628318584071
5159281,5,B008G4T5VM,"Well if it is like the first four movies,Then it should be great especially for a horror movie because we really like the other ones that were made. Because you never kno what is going to happen in the movies and it's very thrilling because it keeps you on the edge of your seat when you watch any of these movies.",1346544000,7,314,4.163934426229508

5159285,3,B008G4T5VM,"Not the worst of the franchise, but nearly so. Yet this remains watchable for those seeking some guilty pleasures in the form of boobs, gore and uninspired kills. Watch this for fun, not for horror.

Director Declan O'Brien (Cyclops, Sharktopus, Wrong Turn 3-5) returns for his third Wrong Turn sequel featuring our favorite inbred hillbilly cannibals: Three Finger (Borislav Iliev; Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead), One Eye (Radoslav Parvanov; Undisputed 2-3, Wrong Turn 6) and Sawtooth (George Karlukovski; El Gringo).  We open with wretched dialogue, a graphic sex scene, and an opening kill that just continues to never live up to that of Dead End (2007); basically, OBriens sequel staples.

This time our cadre of horny vacationing college students are attending the Mountain Man Festival on Halloween in West Virginia. Its quite like Burning Man, but with a bunch of buffoons dressed up as inbred, mutant, cannibal hillbillies.

The writing, story and dialogue were all pornishly bad.  And boasting 3-4 heavy-moaning sex scenes, the lecherousness makes the nudity from the Night of the Demons 1-2 (1988, 1994) almost feel classy.  Really feeling forced and rather out of nowhere is the new addition to the family.  Our cannibal brothers father Maynard is probably among Doug Bradleys (Hellraiser 1-8) lesser roles.

The action/violence was terrible and the special effects were pretty weak, with most of the blood spurts being CGI.  The majority of death scenes were forgettably poor (even the electrocution, sigh), including some of the most lackluster disembowelments of the franchisealthough, the Jigsaw-esque car trap disembowelment was pretty good, mostly for the humor of the victims lover trying to shove the bloody intestines back into him!  Credit would also be due for the leg-hammering scenejust brutal a la Misery (1990).  Lastly, the lawnmower death scene was okay; somewhat funny along with some good chunky-sloppy gore.

Were I to order the Wrong Turn movies from best to worst, Id say 1-4-2-5-3, with a big gap between 4 and 2.  Somehow Declan O'Brien nailed it with part 4 (still smutty, but the best kills from parts 3-5) and just couldn't reproduce it.  Perhaps an issue of budget?  No clue.  I was especially disappointed by the stage-y town set designthe last third of the movie takes place in the sheriffs office and the street outside.

The writing might be terrible, yet this sequel manages to entertain without much regret.  Youll feel more fun (or tedium) than fear.  But this could make for a great Bad Movie Tuesday if you're looking for some gory laughs.",1504742400,,2585,5.097387173396674

5159304,1,B008G4T5VM,"Well as it turns out Wrong Turn 4 was more a fluke than anything because Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines is a terrible movie. I started reading a newspaper about 30-40 minutes into it but pushed through to the end knowing I'm unlikely to bother with another movie in this franchise again. It's meant to be a direct sequel to WT4 but a prequel to the first three.

 The plot was absurd, Doug 'Pinhead' Bradley now the 'father figure' of the deformed cannibal brothers arrested and thrown in the cells at the local cop shop and the cannibal brothers killing anyone that gets in their way in attempting to break him out. Supposedly a music festival is on nearby which is why the little town is nearly deserted and with the phone lines down the local female sheriff is constantly taunted by Bradley at her impending demise throughout the movie. There is a cameo from Finn Jones of Game of Thrones but still.

 The acting was crap (including that of Bradley), the local streets looked pathetic as it was clear it was all shot in a smaller studio than WT3 and looked more like a set out of Sesame Street, the CGI was horrible and the movie had a feel of being more a contractual obligation than a genuine attempt to make money or heaven forbid expressing a creative vision.",1463702400,,1260,4.489082969432315

5159345,1,B008G4T5VM,"I'm sorry but this movie was complete garbage, and I'm saying that as a dedicated Wrong Turn fan. Very disappointing.
Not only were Maynard's (Doug Bradley) lines unbelievably cheesy, but the movie was nauseatingly predictable. The characters were forgettable, and I thought it was ridiculous how the entire town just suddenly disappeared to the festival and was not heard from again.
If you like gory kills and nothing more, sure, this film is for you. If you prefer real plots and good acting in your horror, though, look elsewhere. (Assuming you already saw the first two Wrong Turn films, might I suggest trying Wrong Turn 6? That one wasn't half bad, actually! At least it had some sort of story.)

I am not sure whom I was angrier at: the demented cannibal hillbillies or the screaming victims who turned passive at all the wrong turns. The crazy killers were led by the well-known Doug Bradley of HELLRAISER fame. Here he is the uncle of a clan of inbred hyeanas. They are born to indescribable sadism. I kept hoping that justice would prevail and every last one would be subject to the same tortures inflicted on their screaming victims. But the victims showed no brains about survival. The lone exception was the Sheriff Angela, and even she had been heavily armed. I suppose that different viewers react in different ways to monstrous celluloid evil. In my case it was anger. If the director wanted an emotional reaction other than horror or disgust, then he succeeded with me. I still cannot decide about the artistic merit of this movie.

 We are in Fairlake, West Virginia. A couple, Billy (Simon Ginty) and Cruz (Amy Lennox) are making out in a tent. We see three people coming towards the tent. Suddenly, Billy and Cruz are interrupted. It is their three friends, Gus (Paul Luebke), Julian (Oliver Keare) and Lita (Roxanne McKee), played a joke on them in backwood clothes.  They plan on going to the Halloween festival in the town of Fairlake this evening.
  A reporter, kaleen (Emila Klayn) goes into the woods to jog before she returns to town for the festival. The mutant rednecks get to her and cut off her fingers. She runs and meets Maynard (Doug Bradley). She helps her to hide.
  You will have to watch the rest of the movie to find out what happens next.

The horror elements of this film and acting were average, but it was kind of boring in parts of the film compared to the previous installments. So far, the first four installments were a lot better.

5159428,4,B008G4T5VM,"This instalment to the tremendous Wrong Turn series was a bit of a let down. This one is a sequel to number 4, still taking place before the original. Great concept, but the film had a lot of problems.

Having said that, it was interesting to see who 'fathered' the hillbilly's. The sense of loyalty was profound, and the menacing ex-Pinhead actor was creepy. There was a sense in the film that it had difficulty progressing; a lot of the film was threatening banter between Doug Bradley and the Sheriff, and the festival was not a very good excuse for the people to gather in the town - after all, we hardly saw any footage of the festival.

The characters were a bit weaker in this film, but it was terrifying at the end when the blind chick is found by the hillbilly crew - it is terrifying because we know what is going to happen to her after the film ends (based on the fact that we know the hillbilly's have a family in later years).

Still, I did enjoy the film and I will watch it again (probably a few times). It will be interesting to see if this is a film that grows on you. 4 stars might seem too high based on this review, but despite the films problems, it still is a great movie, it definitely adds to the franchise. I just wish it had been produced more effectively.",1375401600,,1282,4.245901639344262

But I stuck with it, as I usually do because of my love of B-movie horror. This movie is where I will have to draw the line. It's just laughable. Prosthetic latex masks that don't adhere to the actors faces. Ludicrous storylines that make you slap your forehead multiple times. Inbred killers that can amazingly predict every action without fail..... Just your usual low-budget horror. This is what makes this so hard. I love low budget horror and have seen too many to count. But, I guess, the more I see, the more jaded I become..... I just couldn't stomach this one. I know it's called 'wrong turn', but it should have been called Wrong Decision. Decision after decision, just more abysmal than the next. Police sheriffs giving guns and car keys to drunks. Opening motel doors to deformed freaks multiple times. Streets being completely packed with people and vehicles during a town festival and then being devoid of anything in a matter of seconds. I just don't know what to think anymore about my beloved B-movie horrors. Maybe age and experience have gotten to me, but I find myself nitpicking more and more quite often. So to end my rant..... You have to really love low-budget, no story, un-believable tales of bloodthirsty hillbillies to get through this one. But, at least it has some boobs.",1366848000,,1460,4.729411764705882

That, and stupidity on my part because I knew full well what this movie would be like and yet watched it anyway..........as I have the entire series (only kept the first one that started it all).  I wish I could say I was pleasantly surprised by this installment but it was pretty much business as usual.  At this point, they're following a worn-out formula; they don't deviate from it one iota.  On one hand, you have the three maniacs running around giggling.  On the other hand, you have the usual accounting of fodder.  (The body count was as high as the cast of non-hillbillies.)  The deaths weren't particularly inspired.  Apparently, at this stage of the game, this trio of nitwits can kill with impunity, with no one the wiser.  This means running roughshod over an entire town that left for a nearby music festival.  I don't know how this can be accomplished in any known universe.  Bodies were left strewn about hither and yon (maybe their meat locker was full?).  The only dubious honor involved in this effort was the casting of Pinhead (Doug Bradley), as Maynard Odets.  Unfortunately, without his iconic makeup he's just another bald geezer.

At this juncture, I don't see how they can breathe life back into this franchise, especially if they keep basing everything on the same story with the same results.

I liked Wrong Turn 1, very good movie, Wrong Turn 2 wasn't as good, but it was watchable, 3 sucked, 4 was decent, which brings me back to this one, absolutely horrible, bad acting alone did it for me, none of the actors were convincing, usually when I get movies this bad, I take them to work and leave them on the lunch room table cause I know somebody will take it, sometimes when I come back it's gone, but then it's times where I still see it sitting there.

As this happens, the sheriff tries to defend her jail from the freaks in the middle of a town that has no people, and very bad writing arranges to have the killers come out on top.

This is really a low budget movie and is just a cash out. The movie takes place in a town festival but the town is empty. Where are all the people ? Looks like a fake movie set. The hillbillies look stupid and there are no spectacular kills and effects (which is what wrong turn has always been about). Dont be fooled because Doug bradley is in this because his performance is shocking and makes you realize why he has always been dressed as a monster with limited lines,He cant act ,He went from hellraiser to this ? Even the low budget horror films of the 80's were better than this movie !!! THIS MOVIE IS TOTAL CRAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1360972800,,775,4.208053691275167
5159452,3,B008G4T5VM,"I feel that the Wrong Turn series is essentially an outlet for showing extremely gory ways to kill people nowadays. Now while I have absolutely no problem with that, seeing as I am a huge gore hound and this series always delivers, the movie itself lacks substance and had a decent amount of potential that it didn't live up to.

First off, the set and premise of the movie was that it was supposed to be centered around a music festival in the middle of a small town, something which I thought was pretty cool, but we hardly ever see anything about said festival and most of the movie takes place either in the police station or wherever one of the victims is getting killed.

Second, the time this movie took place is only clear if you look really close at the subtle detail of certain parts of the movie. There is a brief shot of a computer indicating that it's 2003, the year the original WT was released. Also, it can be inferred that the cannibals recently escaped from the Asylum since WT 4 is a prequel and this is obviously not a prequel of a prequel so the movie apparently takes place between 4 and 1.

Third, there are some make-up inconsistencies such as blood disappearing from wounds on a shirt and a few other small screw ups that might disappoint the avid horror movie critic.

To conclude, it's a great movie if you want to see a lot of gore and don't mind all the cosmetic fallacies and plot holes. If you're overly bothered by moderate things like that then this is not a movie for you. I would suggest this to gore fans or those who want a simple slasher to watch.",1360540800,,1585,4.344594594594595
5159453,2,B008G4T5VM,"Fox takes another wrong turn with this failing Slasher series, this time bringing the inbred hillbillies out of the woods and in to the Mountain Man music festival, where they have their pick of plenty of drugged-up, over-sexed teenagers to mangle and destroy as they see fit. Why this is being called WRONG TURN 5 when all of the teens end up exactly where they intended to is beyond us, but that is the least of our worries. Declan O'Brien's script could have supplanted any other group of deranged killers and the film would have remained just as pointless and unnecessary as the last sequel. Once the audience has given up on the annoying lead characters, the only thing to look forward to is the gratuitous sex and gore, but even the effects department fails to deliver any memorable moments of bloody violence. The continued decline in quality and entertainment that this series poses is beginning to outweigh the fun of the first two films, and it is time to either bring back Joe Lynch for more absurd exploitation or kill off the mutant mountain men once and for all.

5159465,1,B008G4T5VM,"Let me just put it this way; Horror is a dying genre in the film making industry. And this film does NOTHING to give horror any justice. If anything, it's contributing to its downfall. Even though I knew this fifth installment in the Wrong Turn franchise was going to be awful, this film fell WAY below my already painfully low expectations.

Now I loved the first two Wrong Turn movies. They were crazy, creepy, and completely unexpected. That's not to say they were flawless, but compared to other slash n' hack fests I've seen, these were quite driving films. Ever since Declan O' Brien took over this franchise, he's just been soaking it with every predictable slasher cliche in the book, substituting convincing practical effects with inferior CGI gore, and making every character he casts into idiotic stereotyped teenagers/ young adults that value nothing more than sex and drugs.

The entire movie is more predictable than a clogged toilet after taking a massive dump that clearly won't flush. The plot is nothing more than your sub-average dime a dozen generic slasher plot; you have a group of horny college kids (again, horribly stereotyped), they plan on attending a party (the ""Mountain Man Festival"")...and they get killed off one by one by the hillbillies. In fact, Three Finger pretty much does all the work here. Saw Tooth and One Eye are kind of just shoved into the background and hardly make an appearance for their roles to serve any significant purpose. They'll throw a punch maybe once or twice, but that's it. Speaking of the kills, they are all horrendous. Not in the sense that they're gruesome, but in the sense that it leaves you thinking ""what's the point?"" It really does seem that Delcan is missing the idea behind the character of these cannibals, and why they do what they do. Delcan has reduced these once sneaky and clever cannibals into senseless torturers that ""play with their food."" If you watch the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All but one death, which was the first one, was actually relevant to the point of the movie. Every death after that was set up like a scenario you would see in a Saw movie...which is...alright, BUT THIS ISN'T SAW. This is WRONG TURN. These are CANNIBALS, they EAT their victims, they just don't torture them for no reason and leave them in the middle of the street. Declan seems to miss this every time, and this is what makes his movies directionless and just flat out stupid. He seems to be more interested in creating morbid death scenes and pointlessly drawn out sex scenes that is basically borderline porno footage that have nothing at all to do with the plot than making a constructed story that actually makes sense. UGH.

The acting is so awful it isn't even worth mentioning, much less the characters that decide to constantly contradict the plot. ""We're staying in here until dawn when my deputies arive, and that's final. We HAVE to stick together."" - ""Billy go look for your dead girlfriend while I go halfway across the street to contact some guy who clearly takes me for an idiot, and give my ONLY working vehicle to some drunken bimbo while an impressionable idiot college girl watches over my station with a manical psychopath that clearly nobody trusts except this forementioned impressionable college girl who eventually buys into his BS."" If this isn't pure stupidity at its highest peak, I don't know what is. The town? I can hardly call it a neighborhood. It looks like maybe one or two small streets and a couple alleyways at most. In fact, a lot of it looks like the backlot of a studio. You can see large trucks (they are hard to miss) blocking off buildings and pathways. Very unimpressive. In fact the festival that's going on only has about 5 minutes worth of footage in the entire 90 minutes this trash film runs for, and when the cannibals arrive everyone in town except the main cast just suddenly disappears? This film is just heeps of flaws and poorly executed...well, just about everything in this movie is poorly executed.

My advice? Stick with the first two movies. They are MILES better, have great effects, plots, and tons of gore, and even sex that doesn't detract from the plot more than that is necessary. Five is by far the worst installment in the Wrong Turn franchise. And from beginning to end you're not going to be ""wowed"" by anything exceptional since the entire movie is predictable and cluttered with just about every known slasher cliche in the book. If there ever is a sixth movie, I can only hope Joe Lynch will direct it and Declan can stop butchering this franchise. (pun intended). Skip over it and watch the first two.

Wrong Turn 4 was admittedly decent, so I had high hopes for Wrong Turn 5 following in the same vein. Sadly, it did not, but the entertainment factor of the movie is not missed on me.  WT5 has some killer one liners and at least one pair of nice boobs. The stupidity of the victims and the randomness of the hillbilly cannibals rigging up Jigsaw type traps (which makes no sense, and seriously, WHEN did they find time to make those traps anyway?!?!?) is good for a giggle.

5159485,3,B008G4T5VM,"So if you're familiar with the WT series your aware of how different they can be from one to the next.
It used to be in the first two I believe were there's killing getting done and it's not always the deformed hillbillies doing the killing. At some point the normal people trapped in a living nightmare actually do some serious fighting back.
Not so in the last two entries of the series.
But let's stick with WT5 and not get sidetracked with WT4.
This movie features some of the dumbest victims EVER. Might as well just lay in the street waiting to be killed in some horrible way.
It's hard to get into this movie when the people being attacked and picked off one by one run around like chickens with their heads cut off.
So dumb as dirt teenaged idiots and a deputy and an equally retarded sheriff make the roster of soon to be dismembered or ripped apart by three mentally challenged unable to speak I doubt if they can even read hillbilly inbreds.
The kills are creative and some of it is CGI no doubt,but they're still inventive and pretty neat.
One completely unrelated boucing boobies sex scene is inserted (pun intended) and if they just continued with the softcore porn theme from that point on it probably would've been better. The girl is HOT but the scene itself last about thirty seconds...just the mandatory sex scene for a standard horror movie.
SO like I said three mutant cannibals outsmart law enforcerment and a bunch of horny teens...I get the teens but really? Trained law enforcement can't compete with a bunch of ugly morons in fight for survival?
Yeah right.
This movie is plagued with people doing the dumbest things ever instead of just getting a crow bar and wait behind a door and cave a head in or two.
This movie is all about the kills...no twists...no surprise ending...no logic...good kills...nudity at the opening credits and then that's about it.
I hope the next one is infused with the ability to make wonder what's gonna happen instead of silently mouthing out the words: here we go again.",1354233600,,2026,4.599447513812155

5159492,1,B008G4T5VM,"Alright first off, I'm not going to get into how much of an epic failure this movie was with the plot and everything.  So lets just start out by saying the movie in my opinion was terrible because everyone pretty much dies.  So to the people who made the Wrong Turn Films let me start off by saying for the umteenth time THIS ISN'T THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING THE CANNIBALS/WEST VIRGINIA BACKWOODS HILLBILLIES KILLING EVERYONE DOES NOT MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THE GOOD GUYS LIKE IT DID IN THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING WITH LEATHERFACE AND HIS FAMILY.

Now with that being said lets start off by getting into the plot of this movie then comparing it to the epic failure 4th installment of the Wrong Turn movie sequence since it is the only other installment of the Wong Turn movies where everyone dies.  The plot of this film is simple it takes place in a town known as Fair Lake located in Greenbrier County West Virginia home of everyones favorite backwoods redneck cannibal family.  Fair Lake according to the plot is a town that was established in 1814 and de-established in 1817 because all the cannibals who were the first people on the land before it was a town establishment and before West Virginia (originally part of Virginia) was even established as a state ate everyone and turned Fair Lake West Virginia (technically Fair Lake Virginia at the time) into a ghost town.  Basically every year outside the forest area of Fair Lake West Virginia there is a music festival known as the Mountain Man Festival and a group of 4 senior college kids and one college drop out (Billy) saying he's taking a break from school for longer then 2 semesters even though his parents don't know about it decide to camp out in the woods of Fair Lake West Virginia where the fearsome 3 sum of cannibals (3 finger, sawtooth, and one eye + Maynard (the old man in the first 2 wrong turns) live.  After being set up in a trap designed to crash the college students car on their way to the music festival dug by the cannibals involving the college students camping out kicking Maynard.  Right when the students are kicking Maynard after their car crashes from Maynard jumping in front of it when he's down and the cannibals are getting ready to strike their prey, the Greenbrier County Sherif and a few deputies show up and take the kids along with Maynard to jail for assault (mainly on Maynard) and illegal possession of drugs on the college kids.  And since Billy brought the drugs he takes full responsibility for them and the rest of the kids go to a near by motel.  Then the sherif finds out Maynard is guilty of multiple killing crimes and when she tries to report him to a higher police authority through radio the cannibals shut off all the power in the jail and motel.  Then Billy's girl friend Cruz brings him supper and is followed by one of Billy's college companions Julian.  Cruz gets killed by 3 finger on her way and Julian gets to the jail where the Sherif deputizes everyone in the jail cels (basically the 2 college kids + a drunk) to hold down the fort and get Maynard to a more secure facility due to death threats involving the other 3 cannibals from Maynard.

Now comparing Wrong Turn 5 to Wrong Turn 4.
First off Wrong Turn 4 was a worse movie, at least Wrong Turn 5 didn't go take place in this past decade (see prev review on Wrong Turn 4) even though it should have because Maynard is killed in the second Wrong Turn (created in 2007).  And the makers of Wrong Turn 5 didn't go take out all the fun of allot of parts in the plot like they did in Wrong Turn 4.  The creators of the film don't leave the viewer wondering how the cannibals got some of the things they did as they did in the fourth installment of Wrong Turn.  Plus the cannibals in Wrong Turn 5 acted more like killers rather then sissies like they did in Wrong Turn 4.  The good guys in Wrong Turn 5 didn't blow off killing the cannibals when they had the chance like the did in the 4th installment since they never really got a chance at killing the cannibals.  And at least Wrong Turn 5 Bloodbath/Bloodlines has a more suitable name and doesn't look like a poser film to the first wrong turn like the 4th installment did.

However everyone dies in Wrong Turn 5 just like they did in the 4th installment and that's why it only gets one star.  But if you don't mind horror films where everyone dies and the bad guys win, you may like this movie even though it really should have taken place somewhere between 2004 & 2006.  However, in my opinion the creators of the Wrong Turn series of films with the 5th installment have shown pretty much a failure to make up for their god awful creation of the forth wrong turn, are getting pretty desperate for ideas, are starting to feel they should have left the wrong turn series at 3 films, and most importantly feeling like someone else needs to re-make their 4th and 5th installments of the Wrong Turn series.  Just like the people who made Starship Troopers feel about the second and third films they made (well I guess Starship Troopers 3 wasn't really that bad).  And just for the record, you can add a reporter, the sherif's boyfriend, and a deputy to the list of people who are killed in this film.",1353628800,,5248,4.44375

partying in the streets, yet you end up with a deserted studio lot and six or seven people,
including the sheriff.

I'm still baffled how, with such a wild party happening, the entire set is like a ghost
town, with tumbleweeds blowing by in the distance.
That said, the acting is quite good, and the kills are quite gruesome.
One scene gives new meaning to the term, ""Lawnmower man.""

There's also a random scene, near the begining, that serves no purpose, except to show a beautiful
girl with large breasts, earning a free pass into the supposed ""festival.""
One would think this ""festival"" would have been a Bon Jovi concert, judging by her enthusiasm.
Hey, i'm not complaining...

It's also worth noting that the inbred cannibal trio possess a whole lotta smarts, which kind of
struck me as funny.
They can knock down cell towers, create a makeshift rotisery out of scrap wood & trash barrels,
dodge bullets like a super hero, and string up a security guard like a christmas tree.

5159495,1,B008G4T5VM,"This is going to sound like the Woody Allen joke about the ""food being awful and the portions so small,"" but this movie consisted of very little but raw sadism, and it wasn't even well done.  The acting, effects, and make-up were terrible.  Even the fairly graphic sexual nudity could not be enjoyed, because this film has a fetish for killing folks en flagrante delicto.

To be clear, I LIKE extreme movies, even ones with torture in them, including the Saw and Hostel series.  But those movies had some point to them.  However small, however contrived, there was at least some plausible context for the suffering, and some anxiety and hope, rising and falling tensions, the possibility of justice or revenge--something.  ""Wrong Turn 5"" is an exercise in pointless, nihilistic suffering, full stop.

If you have a taste for scenes of torture, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tortured/dp/B001G5REP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tortured</a>.

5159500,3,B008G4T5VM,"How often does a horror franchise needs not one but two prequels?  Apparently Wrong Turn did and so we now have Bloodlines.

Set a couple of years after Bloody Beginnings, we find that our favorite trio of inbred cannibal brothers have now left the snow covered grounds of the asylum and have taken up residence in the cabin featured in the original Wrong Turn as well as having a ""normal"" human caregiver played by Doug Bradley (Hellraiser).  As usual we have the standard set up of partying college kids to supply an ample amount of sex, boobs, and Hot Plate Specials, a few cops, and one town drunk.  All of which takes place during West Virginia's Mountain Man Festival, an idea that is sadly never fully utilized.  Somehow all the action takes place in the darker, deserted part of town.

Now, there are plenty of good kills and lots of nudity.  But my problem lies in the character played by Doug Bradley.  The man is seriously annoying.  Think of the old dude in Friday the 13th who kept saying ""You're all Dooomed!"" and amplify that to a twenty.  He's not menacing but every time he opened his mouth to let the sheriff and the kids know that his boys were coming for him and what they would do to them, I seriously wanted to jab a pair of chop sticks through my eardrums.  I get that these movies are all about the brothers and the victims are just meant to be that.  But Doug Bradley isn't one of them.  At best, he's a poor Jigsaw wannabe with his little mind games and traps.  Hopefully Declan O'Brien will kill him off in the next prequel as he hinted at earlier in the movie as one of the brothers clearly hates this guy and I, for one, can't blame him.  And how do I know there will be another prequel?  Where else can they go with the series when we now have a fourth baddie that clearly isn't around by the time Eliza Dushkue, Desmond Harrington, and their friends come knocking on their door in the original?",1353283200,,1925,4.380281690140845

The characters were slightly more developed, which is very important to any horror film.  The kills only work if you somewhat care about them. I agree with many of the other reviews on how stupid (for lack of a better word) the plotline was, but I guess like any fan I'm hoping this situatuion was created to get us through & past the mess that was #4. Please bring back the creative camera angles & characters that actually fight for survival. Take us back to the isolation and desperation we were given in the beginning of the Wrong Turn series.  I guess if I had to point out what was really decent in this movie it would be the downfall of the final two victims.  While sort of predictable, you can't help but feel for them.

The film takes place in modern times some 30 years later after...? I'm not sure what, but now Maynard Odetts (Doug Bradley- ""Hellraiser"" Pinhead) has been there for 30 years but absent from the other films as a killer. I decided not to think too hard on this one and just enjoy the film. There must be more than one branch of cannibal killers in the area.

The town of Fairlake, WV is having a 10 year annual festival celebrating the Hillbilly cannibal slasher...Seriously?

People are in costume which allows our recluse gruesome threesome to enter town with knowledge of cell phone towers, phone lines, and electricity. The film gives literal meaning to ""Give me a hand"" and ""Lend me your ears."" The killings/torture was done in different and entertaining ways bordering on Troma style using real pig entrails. Clearly this film is not for everyone. But for those who like an 80's Troma style slasher film, you might want to check this one out.

Basically there is a music fest going on but we rarely see that, so the town is empty expect for the teens, the sheriff, her husband (never explained if it was or not), Maynard, and a drunk.

5159520,3,B008G4T5VM,"I have all of this franchise on DVD and now in Blu-ray and have been somewhat of a fan. Here's what I noticed after the first viewing:

Story:
It's never made clear the time frame of this movie. WT4 was a prequel. After some long thought on this, I believe this is supposed to be after 4 and before 1. All 3 of these mutants are alive and well, so it doesn't make sense that this would be a continuation from 3.
There is a reference from the older man Maynard that they aren't in an institution any longer. Maynard also refers to the 3 hillbilly freaks as ""my boys."" I never took him seriously, but after some consideration, maybe this man was really supposed to be their father. We don't know where this man came from or how he got hooked up with these 3. We just know that he ran into them at some point. We do see a computer screen at one point that would indicate that it is 2003, which would put this just months or even weeks before the original Wrong Turn.
The story is very simple. Simply put, a group of victims gather at the sheriff's office one way or another and get picked off one at a time.
Once the gang is more or less together at the sheriff's office, the sheriff tells everybody to stay together. They are trying to split them up to take them out one at a time. From that time forward everyone does their desperate best to try and split up. And when there's nobody else left that can leave, the sheriff herself wants to leave.
This is all supposed to take place during a festival and the trailer leads you to believe that this is all wrapped around this festival, but you never get to see it. It's only an excuse to have an empty set. The sheriff was expecting a busy night of trouble from this festival and she didn't get one call or visit the entire night.
I was confused as to how these 3 hillbillies could get hurt when smacked around by their 'father,' yet when one is shot in the leg, he doesn't flinch or even bleed. The one called 'Three finger' looks like he always did, but the other 2 don't resemble themselves from the other movies very much.

The kills:
Of course creativity is the thing with this and the movie does deliver some unique ways to kill people. I did feel that this time things had a bit of a ""Saw"" feel to it.

The sex:
Three sex scenes. They were very sensual rather than overly graphic. One had nothing to do with the story.

The Special Effects:
I didn't notice any CGI in this one. They went 'old school' and used actual animal guts. It gave a more realistic feel to it. Good call on this one.
One particular kill was the first one where the woman is killed in the street. It looks like she has a day pack under her shirt. this is where the guts were stored for the scene. Really needed to do a better job on this scene.
Maynard is shot in the shoulder. He's hurting pretty badly, but over time he just blows it off. Apparently he also has a self-cleaning shirt, as the blood gradually disappears as well.

The set:
This town sure looked like a small movie set. I was unimpressed. Low budget all the way here.

The acting:
Good acting all around. None of these actors are even American. You may pick up a slight accent from a line or 2 if you listen closely. Very impressive how well they acted and kept to an accurate American accent.

Other random stuff:
The ending of this movie looks a lot like the same location where #3 ended, at a hairpin turn. Pretty sure it's the very same place.
Apparently people don't believe in using their brakes when something goes bad when driving.
Nice BMWs don't have air bags.
Greenbrier county, being a redneck area (I have lots of family still living there) has apparently become very open minded and elected a pretty woman to be county sheriff.

The Extras:
Few extras are included in the Blu-ray copy. No deleted scenes. You get to see how the killings were done and that the next installment may pick up not too far from where this one leaves off. That's about it.

The disc itself:
The picture quality was excellent and well presented with a nice menu system. There is a ton of movie trailers as well, which I could have done without.

I give this one 2.5 stars. It's not far from WT3 in my mind. Actually 3 was better. There was real character development and drama going on in 3. This was more like a bunch of idiots trying to see how fast they can get themselves killed. So this would be the worst of the bunch. If you're a fan, rent it.",1351036800,35,4431,4.258026159334126

The kill scenes where nothing special and they should have been great, this is why most of us buy Wrong Turn movies right? The makeup was terrible and the whole movie just had a really low budget look and feel to it. The town where pretty much the whole movie took place looked like a bad cheap movie set. Im all about atmosphere in horror movies and this had none. I was pumped months ago when i first read about this movie and it sounded like it might have a little bit of a Halloween vibe to it...nope! Some festival is supposed to be going on but all of a sudden the town is pretty much empty. If your going to have a bunch of people in the streets then all of a sudden everyone is gone why would you not have the killers wipe out a bunch of people, there is plenty of ways you could have done something, lazy, lazy? I get these kind of movies have bad acting but this was really bad. Im all for sex scenes but one of them was just randomly thrown in the movie and had nothing to do with anything.

I could go on but I will stop there, just trust me on this one, rent before you buy, this director needs to get a clue because this movie was complete crap and ive been excited for it to be released for a few months now.

this film was beyond pathetic and boring...the acting was so bad that i couldn't even stand to watch them talk and this new and exciting plot was ridiculous and i was left have way through the film wishing i had never started watching it to begin with...i was truly and deeply disappointed on how bad of a film declan o'brien created this time around. nothing made sense in the film at all,the acting was horrible,the hilliker brothers looked like nothing more than 3 guys wearing store bought halloween masks and three finger this time was so annoying u wanted to reach through the tv and punch him in the face and it just got worse from there on.

 5 so called college aged kids 3 boys 2 girls are heading to the mountian man festival when they almost hit a man in the middle of the road and crash and after a brief fight with him the kids and him are hauled off to the town jail by police and then the fun begins...NOT...the town doesnt even look like a town it looks like part of the back lot of universal studios and for such a big festival going on in town and stuff where did all of the people go...even when there was explosions and fires and people standing in the street screaming for help not one other person besides the small group of would be victims were ever seen i mean really???? the kills in this film were boring and the special effects to go along with them were cheaply done and u could tell when u saw the so called bodies....but the worst part about this entire film was the acting by all of the actors including the beloved doug bradley his whole character made no sense and he repeated the same crap over and over again and became so annoying that i just wanted to turn down the volume on my tv just so i didn't have to hear him talk but the acting on the parts of the others who played the kids was even worse and sometimes the words would come out faster than what their lips were moving and the ending of the film was left open to yet another one to be made...please lets hope not!

all in all this movie was complete and utter CRAP and a waste of time to watch and the money to watch it but since i have the other 4 i will buy it just to add to the series but i won't be watching it again cuz i couldn't put myself through that again...i give this new wrong turn 5:blood lines A BIG FAT SUCKING 1 out of the 10 score and thats being generous.",1350777600,5,4496,4.140732265446224

These films are basically like the cheaper version of Final Destination because you mainly only go to see them for the kills! This movie delivers the guts, blood, violence and imagination and it also had some decent acting (Doug Bradley)... I do however believe that this is the 2nd least gory of the wrong turn movies (the least gory being part one) but all in all it still kicked parts 3's ass!

Plot: The Mountain Man Festival... a time to cherish the crazed and deformed hillbillies from 1817. But four uninvited guests have arrived and blood is being spilled left and right... now, in a Police Station (Which is where three quarters of the movie takes place!!) a group of people must stay alive to let the world know that their lives have taken a wrong turn towards death and that killer hillbillies are responsible for every poor lost soul that fed their cannibalistic hunger!

Review: The action and terror in this movie was most definitely campy and cheesy but in a fun-spirited way which brings me to a couple of good things about this movie.... there was practically almost no CGI gore, fun characters, some decently tense scenes and one scene that cannot go without mention, you all know the mirror scare where a character looks into a mirror, opens it and then when that character closes it some figure appears and either A.) Scares them or B.) Kills them, just think of that in the opposite way! The Soundtrack was cool too; it had some very good bands such as The Cheetah Whores and my favorite The Blackout City Kids! The make up effects could've been a little better and the pacing could've been quicker but all in all this film was quite decent.

Acting: It wasn't as bad as everyone says it is, I really didn't see one seriously bad actor in this movie and that says a lot!

Gore: I really wished that there was a massacre seen involving the whole town, but unfortunately it doesn't quite happen that way! we get a chopped off finger, a lot of guts, severed limbs, a gory slashed throat, some chopped up peeps involving a giant bladed lawn mower, some severed ears, stabbings, an off-screen eye gouging scene, and more.... it was probably the least gory in my opinion but it still delivered and it was the best looking of Declan `O Brien's Three Wrong Turn Movies, mainly for the fact that they used a lot more practical gore effects than CGI!

Bottom Line: It was better than part 3 but not as good as parts 1, 2 or 4, I honestly believe that there will be a 6th and most likely the series will continue, parts 1,4, and 5 are based in the same year (2003) but a lot can happen in a year!

This was a SOLID horror movie with a very good villain and just Horrifying deaths.  And sometimes dying is better....

I read that our brains have some difficulty discerning a movie from reality while we are watching it, or of course they would have no effect on us.

This one did.  Pretty sick. Pretty horrifying.

That's why we watch them, no?",1527292800,,473,4.2
