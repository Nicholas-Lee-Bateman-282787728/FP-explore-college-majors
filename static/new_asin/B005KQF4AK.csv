4718098,5,B005KQF4AK,"If you are reading this, you are probably already aware this DVD is a documentary of Marvin (""Popcorn"") Sutton, the ornery old moonshiner of Maggie Valley, North Carolina, as he sets up his moonshine still for one last run of likker to show us young'uns how its done.

This tenth anniversary special edition also contains ""This Is The Last Dam Run of Likker I'll Ever Make"", the private one Neal made for Popcorn to sell personally at his stand.  This longer version contains some quite colorful language said the way only Popcorn could say it.  ""The Last One"" is sanitized for family presentation on PBS.

The ""Last Dam Run of Likker"" is also on YouTube, in pieces, re-encoded as .mp4.  It will give you an idea of what you are going to get.  For me, I saw that and had to have the real thing if I could get it.  Neal must have worked with the Sutton family to get a release so we could all enjoy seeing this documentary of one of our more colorful American ancestors.

You probably know Popcorn is no longer with us, as he chose to return to his maker rather than face prison for doing the thing his family had done for generations.  He is among the last of his kind - an artisan of art that rubbed some people the wrong way.  When you see the mettle of these Mountain Men, you could easily see the British did not have a chance in those mountains during the revolutionary war.

I only wish I could have met and talked with this old coot.  He seemed to have more horse sense than most people I have ever met.

For what its worth, I am 60 years old, and this is the third DVD in my life I thought was worth having, and actually purchased it.  I do not have the Amazon Verified Purchase tag here because I got mine directly from Neal at Sucker Punch Pictures of North Carolina.  Same price.  I did not know he was also selling via Amazon, as I followed the links shown on the YouTube video.  When I saw it here, I knew what this was, and had to write this review.  Thanks to Google and YouTube, I was able to discover a lot more about this old coot's life, and developed a very deep respect for him.",1348531200,31,2099,4.231155778894473

4718100,5,B005KQF4AK,This is a movie I would recommend to all. It's part of our history that has pretty much disappeared. My grandfather had a still when I was younger and I learned how to make shine. When he got up in age he gave the still to a friend so that I wouldn't try to make shine after he passed. This movie is very interesting. Popcorn Sutton was no dummy. He also had a very charitable side that the DVD didn't show. Well worth the money this one is !!!  :),1337644800,,448,3.977777777777778

4718106,5,B005KQF4AK,"I give The Last One DVD much more than 5 stars but can't because there are not that many. Popcorn shows the true way moonshine was made from the beginning. It is truly a bygone era now that Popcorn has passed away. There aren't anymore like him. I personally don't drink alcohol but I knew Popcorn for many years by buying items at his Antique Shop in Maggie Valley, NC on HWY 19. He called it his junk shop and I never understood that. I'm suppose to rate this DVD but I cannot stop but add that Popcorn was a very good man. He gave back much to the poor people in the community and never asked for anything in return. Nor did he even tell the people he would set items on their porches late at night it was him that gave. This DVD is a very heartwarming memory of him to keep and pass on later. I highly recommend  it even to those who do not even drink. A true history lesson.",1320192000,7,879,4.051724137931035

4718156,5,B005KQF4AK,"I enjoy reading about ""the old days"" and these actually were today....just people in our backwoods areas (North Carolina woods) doing things our ancestors did.
Popcorn is an engaging old guy...and very single-minded about what he is all about.
He almost strikes you as one of the old Hatfield-McCoy guys from old pictures, as he is not of our times.
You can see firsthand how he goes about making his White Lightning, how he locates his still, cooks the mash, and how he deals with his friends and associates.
Popcorn committed suicide not so long after this documentary was made; I believe he feared a life in prison, along with other fears he seemed to have.

The life of Popcorn Sutton alone as depicted in this movie is really amazing, but it doesn't stop there as they bring a lifestyle lost in this day and age to the forefront over the course of this movie. The honesty and unscripted dialogue is telling of days gone by and not only is it interesting but educational as well.

Only downside is the newly edited version isn't as good as the true original, which it has a option to watch it as well.

8477118,4,B005KQF4AK,"I bought this for my husband after he had heard about Popcorn. It seemed like something he would like, and he did. I liked it because he reminded me of characters I met while visiting my grandparents as a child. They lived in Bristol, VA, which straddles the state line into TN. Popcorn somewhat resembled my own grandfather, although he grew tobacco and was not a moonshiner nor a drinker. Solid country folk with a deep sense of morality and honor. It was too bad the government couldn't have just left Popcorn alone.",1513296000,,519,4.591397849462366
