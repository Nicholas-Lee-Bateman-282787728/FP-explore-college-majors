8344805,5,B001URA692,"I cannot emphasize enough how important this film is to the history of hip-hop. Though it focuses on the west coast underground it really explains how the dichotomy of underground and mainstream occurred as well as giving exclusive interviews from the guys that were there watching it happen. This film centers around the legendary L.A. open mic which ran from the late 80's to the mid 90's at the Good life cafe in south central. Many of the mc's and dj's who attended this tiny cafe would later become household names such as Snoop Dogg, Will.i.am of black eyed peas, the pharcyde, Jurassic 5, Members of NWA, and many many more. But those household names are only the tip of the iceberg when considering all the underground talent and influence that the resident mc's of the good life had on the mainstream. For example you have the legendary freestyle fellowship which redefined the term ""freestyle"" to mean rapping a verse off the top of the head with no rehearsed or memorized material. They also developed and evolved the double and triple time chopping styles that tech n9ne and bone thugs n harmony would later incorporate into their music, making them lots of money. In fact, tech n9ne was at the good life in 1993 before he had ever started recording music. And the bone thugs were signed by eazy-e of NWA, who was in contact with Myka 9 of the freestyle fellowship(Myka 9 was also a ghost-writer for early NWA).There are many stories of freestyle fellowship being played for up-and-coming emcees and giving them the boost they need to sound original to those who had never heard of freestyle fellowship(which was most people). Before the Leaders of the New School was a group, Busta Rhymes heard Freestyle Fellowship live and talked and rapped with P.E.A.C.E and Myka and was hugely influenced by them stylistically. The same with Talib Kweli and Mos Def of Blackstar. Myka 9 and Talib kweli lived together in the early-mid 90's and they would cypher together and go to open mics in NY with the likes of Mos Def, Nas, Saul Williams, Q-tip, and many more. I can talk all day about how important this film is to hip hop history all I want but it doesn't matter if nobody can watch this essential film for understanding the history of the hip hop industry as well as the history of styles of rap, specifically freestyle and chopping. It's a shame that this movie isn't more widely available from such a high profile director. Ava DuVernay, if you're reading this, the hip hop world needs you to re-issue this on DVD and offer it on Netflix or Hulu. More people need to see this. Besides showing the good life's influence on hip hop it also reveals what young minds can do when given an outlet of creativity. Many lives were saved by the good life and we need more places like this in the world.",1477267200,,2803,4.6305220883534135

This films, directed by one of the rappers from the scene (Ava DuVernay aka Eve of Figures of Speech), documents the legendary hip hop scene / open mic night at the Good Life Cafe in South Central LA from 1990-1994.

The artists that came out of this scene include Jurassic 5, Chali 2na, Cut Chemist, Freestyle Fellowship, Aceyalone, Myka 9, Busdriver, 2Mex, Volume 10, Abstract Rude, Chillin Villain Empire, Rifleman Ellay Khule, Medusa, the list goes on and on....

The Good Life Cafe open mic led directly to the Project Blowed open mic night, currently the longest running hip hop open mic night in history.

Even if you are not familiar with the artists in the documentary, this is a fascinating portrait of underground hip hop and a scene which was struggling to be the antidote to the gangsta rap which was overtaking LA and the entire hip hop industry.

I would rank this among the top 5 greatest hip hop documentaries, up there with Wild Style, Scratch, The Freshest Kids, and Freestyle.

I believe this can still be purchased directly from the creators at the website goodlifelove.

fellowship, project blowed, etc.  some really cool footage and interviews on here.",1389225600,,231,5.026315789473684
