7486192,5,B01711DCHI,Love it! The Limited Edition comes packaged with Blu-Ray and DVD Combo Pack with SPECIAL COVERS on both cases very nice covers on the box as well!!!,1453161600,9,148,4.518518518518518
7486193,5,B01711DCHI,"Excited to finally own this on bluray. Having watched it as it aired each week in Japan, I was immediately hooked on it and knew this was something I wanted to own. I began to wonder who would be casted for the English dub and if it would be given a brilliant deliverance as the Japanese dub was presented. The dub is just as great. It was cool to hear Aaron Dismuke (original voice of Al in the 1st Fullmetal Alchemist) play Twelve and how much his voice has grown since he was a young teen voice actor when he started. I thought for sure that Steve Blum would voice Shibazaki since he seems to voice strong leads in most of the English dubs of Watanabe's animes. I wasn't disappointed with the choice at all. If you like good plot and great pacing with an impactful ending, grab this. You will not be disappointed.",1453161600,10,816,4.305194805194805

7486196,5,B01711DCHI,"AMAZING anime! Beautiful HD display, I got this when the limited edition set was actually a few dollars cheaper than the regular set, so I chose this one. Nothing too special comes out of this one compared to the original. Just a case for the movies and 2 small photos in each case. I would highly recommend!",1468627200,,308,4.421052631578948
7486197,1,B01711DCHI,"A mash up of anime conventions including a secret government program experimenting on/manipulating children, cat/mouse being fed clues and riddles for a protagonist to figure out, a generic cast (super serious guy, chipper guy, shy girl, deranged genius, guy who was so good he barked up the wrong tree and was demoted) and round it out with a plot that touches on terrorism and quickly devolves into a soap opera and you have, Terror in Resonance. I'm not entirely sure what the creators were going for here. The story is dragging by episode 3 and it was a chore to get past episode 6. I only finished watching because I had dropped around $45 on the discs or I would've simply stopped by episode 7. There was clearly an intent to tell a more serious/realistic story here but when they miss the mark, the whole thing ends up feeling like if Pokemon tried to tackle a serious issue. The animation itself and direction is done quite well but the character designs feel as uninspired as the characters they represent. I wanted to like this, but this is simply not up to the standards of the team that created it.",1467158400,,1110,4.582914572864322
7486198,4,B01711DCHI,"Short concise story that kept me on edge for most of the episodes. The main girl Lisa is a little annoying and not a very enjoyable character to watch' thankfully Nine and Twelve make up for that. I found some parts could have been expanded upon, but for only 11 episodes I find that they wrapped things up very nicely. Would recommend watching only before purchasing since it's a small series that you may not want to invest $30-40 in.",1466899200,,436,4.4625

7486204,5,B01711DCHI,"One of the best items i have bought in a very long time

Anime 10/10
The story is pure and amazing. the characters are incredible the poor unfortunate soul of Lisa. she always gets handed the losing hand. Twelve and  Nine are amazing characters their development and the things and reasons they do things are perfect. Lisa was the light that this anime needed however without her the two boys would be nothing

The Limited Edition its self was kind of disappointing, however once you get to the special features the comments and casts commentaries are incredible maybe its just me but the cast seemed to really grasp the concept and understand this anime at its core. Aaron Dismuke for one was amazing as Twelve. He has grown so much as a voice actor and the way he took Twelve and ran with it. it was amazing! If i could thank him for doing the role the way he did and the things that the cast said in the special features i would try.

The Box set
The only special part is probably that it has both blu ray and dvd along with the small pictures/post card things that are inside. they are alright but its nothing really special. I wish that they had considered doing a bigger special edition say like having the sound track with it or some kind of special something. that would have been AMAZING.",1460851200,3,1297,4.414225941422594
7486205,5,B01711DCHI,"This is not an ""easy watch"". If you're just looking for an action-packed show with geniuses taking on the established order, this is probably not for you. The story is deep, intricate, and delicate. The series tries to stay as true to reality as possible (reflected even in the character designs), in order to instill in the audience the sense that while this ISN'T real, it COULD be, and to my mind it was chillingly effective in managing this. At first, it seems as if the story is about two teenaged terrorists, blowing up government buildings. But the fact is, to the protagonists, the bombs are just a means to an end, their real goal is something quite different, and they go to extraordinary lengths to ensure their attacks cause no fatalities. The heroine is refreshingly REAL, no cardboard princess, no secret badass, just an ordinary girl caught up in extraordinary circumstances and just doing her best to muddle through. The police are also refreshingly three dimensional in their reactions to the bombings, and their varying degrees of interest in either just making an arrest or pursuing the actual truth. The series shows what unholy things can happen when politics clash with justice or even simple human decency. Some things may fly over the heads of western viewers, since this series is set very solidly in the modern Japanese political climate, but I found it an interesting learning curve.  And the science used in the series was also presented in interesting and even cool ways.",1458777600,17,1500,4.882352941176471
7486206,5,B01711DCHI,"Terror and Resonance comes from the brilliant mind of the director of Cowboy Bebop and is blended with the haunting soundtrack made possible by Ghost in Shell's soundtrack composer Yoko Kanno, so it's safe to say that this series carried a feeling that was channeled from beginning to end.

Mashima Lisa finds herself entangled with two teenage terrorists, who go by the name of Spinx online, where they give clues to their acts of ""terrorism"". In truth, these two have a far deeper purpose and just want an audience to listen to what it is that they have to say. This series packs a punch- literally in explosions, but in emotions as it shows how far scars can run and block us in our ability to run. It is this entanglement that Lisa has with Sphinx that allows us to fully understand exploitation, abuse, and wish for justice.

This is a beautiful, painful, haunting series, and I'll say this, it wasn't perfect, but it's flaws were overshadowed by its clear message and feeling of hope even in the worst of times. A series anyone has to watch, just to experience this series...because Terror in Resonance is an experience.",1458345600,,1126,4.681818181818182

7486208,3,B01711DCHI,"The animation is good but the plot and characters are lackluster, basically v for vendetta lite. In the end, the price of $45 is too much for what you get.

7486210,5,B01711DCHI,"One of those rare animes that has a great plot, great action and can accomplish bringing everything together in just 11 episodes. Although there is enough substance to maintain this for 15-20 episodes which is the only real disappointment here. When a series is this great sometimes you just want a little more. The story line is amazing and thought provoking. The main characters Nine and twelve don't fit the typical hero/anti hero roles which is refreshing. It has a solid conclusion which should leave most satisfied. Voice acting on this dub is awesome (but I'm never really disappointed by a funimation dub). Overall 4.5/5.

7486215,4,B01711DCHI,"Nine and Twelve are two teenagers with a mysterious past and interesting day job as the terrorist team called Sphinx. When Lisa Mishima gets caught up in their first attack, she finds herself mixed up in their plot without knowing what they are plotting or why.

I was a little reluctant to watch this show at first - at first glance it appeared to be trying to sympathize with terrorists, which didn't sit well with me. But the way (and eventually why) that Sphinx executed their plots made it interesting and entertaining without making me forsake my morals.

Sphinx immediately challenges the police with their attacks, posting videos and dropping hints as to where the next attack will come from. Each attack is like a mini mystery while still furthering the main plotline along. The ending neatly ties everything up and was supremely satisfying (I love good endings).",1454976000,3,872,4.885135135135135

7486222,4,B01711DCHI,"(May contain spoilers)

I was looking for some anime to watch, and I came across this one, which is directed by 'Watanabe Shinichiro'. As soon as I read who was directing it, the hype went from 0 to 10. The story follows 2 teens who are geniuses (Nine and Twelve), and by terrorist acts, want the world to know about secrets the government of japan is hiding. a 3rd character (Lisa) without knowing ends up getting involved in the mess that the other characters are making.  The animation is beautiful and can be breathtaking at times. You could tell this was one of the most important things of the show. It can be eye candy overload. The music which is composed by 'Yoko Kanno' is also gorgeous, and merges beautifully with the animation, thus creating some powerful scenes . Terror in Resonance presents some really interesting plot and concepts, but they somehow never really merge together very well, and I'm pretty sure it's because of series being only 11 episodes. When it comes to the 'characters', I feel like they really missed a good chance at making them excellently developed. There IS a little bit of development, but not enough, in my opinion. Overall, the series was never able to properly tell the story is was trying to tell the audience. Still, in my opinion, the story and plot aren't too bad, and I was able to still very much enjoy the show. If you're a person who is a plot and story critic, you might not like it, but it's worth giving a shot.

Limited Edition packaging:

This limited edition does not come with many things. It only has 4 art cards, and a special artbox. I did not pay much more than what the regular edition was going for, which is the reason I got it. I simply prefer the art that it has. I will upload some images, so you guys can see how it looks.",1453334400,30,1794,4.443768996960486

8737834,4,B01711DCHI,"When my dad I bought this dvd two years ago, I loved the gift we bought together. It was a very beautiful show by Shinichiro Watanabe and Kazuto Nakazawa on Fuji Tv's Noitamina block. I got hooked onto this series a couple years back and I still watch it today.

The characters were beautifully drawn and the background visuals are very well designed, the animation was very well proportioned, the music was sad yet beautful and the ending song and ending as a whole made me cry. The plot is very good but needs a bit more of a longer story and the voice actors nailed their characters. My favorite characters in thwme show were Nine, Lisa and Shibazaki.

A couple things I didn't like about the show is that how the story is quickly rushed for eleven episodes. I wished the series was ran a bit longer. Another issue I have is that they didn't have enough to explain Lisa and Shibazaki's backstory. I heard a tiny bit of Shibazaki's past but I didn't heard any of Lisa's backstory. I've heard major backstories from Nine, Twelve and Five in their shady, grim past but I never seen much of the main character(Nine/ Arata Kokonoe) on when he was born, how he ended up at the institution, how he met Twelve and Five and how he was plotting for revenge when escaped.

Flaws aside, it's a very good show with a good premise and great storyline.

If you like this show, there are similar shows like:
-Ergo Proxy
-Hellsing
-Texhnolyze
-Deadman Wonderland
-Psycho Pass
-Tokyo Ghoul
-Michiko and Hatchin
-Cowboy Bebop
-Samurai Champloo

It was a great gift that I should be watching anytime soon and I thank my Dad for helping me buy it together.",1530835200,,1638,4.52027027027027
8737835,3,B01711DCHI,"Not Shinichiro Watanabe's best work.  His name was a big selling point for me. Best known for Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, 2 segments of The Animatrix, The animated segment in Kill Bill, and Space Dandy.  With that resume I expected more form this title. Shinichiro's fun, cool, hilarious, edgy style is absent for most of the series. The animation is really top notch and well done but that's its only good point. Very predictable derivative Anime that tries to be political but fails to say anything. The Characters are all anime cliches and anime tropes you've seen in every other anime. It just fails to stand out from the crowd of other better anime. Especially from the guy that gave us Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo.",1526601600,,730,4.785714285714286

8737842,4,B01711DCHI,"Terror in Resonance is a likable series. However it leaves a lot to be desired. The first words I said after finishing this series ""what a bummer"". This show had a lot of potential. It created an intriguing world and provided just enough backstory to grab your attention. I believe it did what it could in only 11 episodes but missed the mark on being a memorable anime.

The art, dub, and music for this show are awesome. Its a beautiful show no question. The story attempts to carry the show for as long as it can but the rushed ending and plot holes really become noticeable during the last episodes. This show isn't going for realism but some of the things they do to make the ending seem complete are just a stretch in the least.

I did like this show. I wanted more of it, more answers, more build up.... less damsel in distress. For $60 and a lot of hype all you get is 11 episodes and what felt like an incomplete anime even though this show does have an ending. Honestly I would stream this show if you could. I don't really think its worth owning at this point.",1475625600,2,1071,4.270935960591133
