8234542,3,B000YZHFK4,"The dvd was mastered poorly. It included one episode twice, why?  It also included some cartoons that had Nothing to do with Tobor.",1438128000,,131,4.695652173913044
8234543,3,B000YZHFK4,"This item is supposed to have 4 Tobor selections.  However, in the copy I received, which was in new condition, there were in reality only 3 selections as the 3rd and 4th were the same.  If you don't mind this, then order the item.  Otherwise order one of the more expensive editions now available.  Although no one else has mentioned this, it appears to be a manufacturing error.  It may or may not have been duplicated in other copies.",1232841600,3,437,4.481012658227848

8234545,1,B000YZHFK4,It seems like this is the only DVD compleation version availible but unforgently it wasn't remastered to make it look like how it looked when it came out originaly. I bought this for my dad and athough he was greatful to have it. He wished that i looked and sounded like it had when he was a kid,1211328000,,295,4.103448275862069
8234546,1,B000YZHFK4,"Like the corny ""home made"" cover, this is a cheap thrown together release . First off the video and audio quality is horrible and secondly it is NOT in color, though the package and item description says it is. It's basically a ""gimic"" / ""False Advertising"" to make money.

If you want a high quality 8th man I reccomend the high quality 16:9 wide screen release by T.A. Productions.",1208217600,,383,4.550724637681159
8234547,1,B000YZHFK4,"Tobor the 8th man is not in color, it is in black and white. If it is it may be colorized. Make sure that this item is what it says. Please.",1198281600,,140,3.5483870967741935
