8005705,5,B00012QLMI,"Very well done prequel to 'Wizard of Darkness', & contains different elements from the other film to make this stand out on its own. True, it does have a 'Terminator' formula of strange-man-meeting-target-girl-to-keep-her-alive plot, but makes it no less fun to view, especially if you're into bloody teen horror. And blood is definitely what you get here! Featuring the late great Eisei Amamoto from 1967's 'King Kong Escapes' & 2001's 'Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack'.",1384041600,,502,5.448717948717949
8005706,2,B00012QLMI,"Eko Eko Azarak was the best bad movie I ever seen. The sequel, not as amusing. It was never very scary or even funny. But I'm still going to watch the last part..",1114128000,,162,3.9393939393939394
8005707,5,B00012QLMI,"I really enjoyed the first in this series and the second part does not fail to excite and titillate. Also,Its very scary. Unlike the 3rd movie the cast is the same.....at least Misa is the same (She's the Good chief witch).

If you can find them get both at the same time and watch them one after the other. There was a little bit more money for the 2nd one and you can see it on the screen.

I hope you like them as much as I did.

Thanks",1106870400,5,439,3.9101123595505616
