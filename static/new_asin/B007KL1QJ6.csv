Prior to getting this DVD, if I was working on a project where I had to file notes, pictures, graphs, leads, etc., I would open a Word folder and put everything in there. The problem was I would have to open each doc to review. With this note system it can all be laid out in one long form and you can see everything at once.

I purchased a different DVD from this author previously, so I knew what kind of quality to expect. And I wasn't disappointed. You can go at your own speed and learn as little or as much as time allows. By having the DVD in my desk, if there is something I need a refresher on, it is right there. I do not have to call `tech support' and pay high hourly rates that I cannot afford.

What impresses me the most is that this producer is not trying to ""sell up"" to other products or services. He is always giving you tips and instructions on how to get as much detail as you can for free. I like free!

I would definitely recommend this lesson to anyone who wants to take advantage of new, no-cost, up-to-the minute applications for their computers. You get so much for the low price!",1334188800,,1159,4.142222222222222
8519109,5,B007KL1QJ6,"As a new small business owner, I am still getting up to speed on all the free tools out there to help me stay organized. I found this DVD very helpful to walk me through Evernote, possible uses of it, as well as the different platforms where it can be installed.

I am a visual learner, so I like instructional material that is very clear. Similar to the other DVDs by this company, I appreciate that much of the content is a capture of the narrator's computer screen as he goes through all the exact steps needed to set up the various accounts and to use the apps. I liked that I could pause the DVD and go through the step right along with the narrator.

One of the most valuable parts of this DVD is the Tips and Tricks section. I learned some things that I will be putting to use right now.

Overall, this DVD is a good tutorial to help you get Evernote installed and running on your computer and other devices.  It is easy to follow along and does not use any complicated jargon. Much appreciated if you are not a computer whiz. Bottom line, if you enjoy learning and giving things a try when it comes to computers and applications, this DVD will be great for you.",1334102400,2,1169,4.252252252252252
