521693,5,6302824737,"Yes .Hi.
Shame on Sony pictures.
Fans of this film deserv so much more/but I guess they don't care.
I can see however. That Sony pictures is trying to give their customers a option to view this film in decent quality.
However. Sony pictures still has no good excuse fore not putting this film on disc.
I still feel that this film would look and sound a lot better on BD.
So I still think strongly. How dare you Sony pictures.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I call Sony pictures all the time.
And all I get is there isn't enough demand to put this film on disc.
I guess that's why a lousy DVD-R of the film just dubbed straight from a old VHS tape is still selling on ioffer.
And you can get a DVD-R of the film  that has been burned to a DVD -R.Which was taken from on demand standard def.
Why is that Sony pictures.?Ha.?
So. I bough the amazon instant video download.
Decent/but not great qulity.
As far as those old VHS tapes go.
At $ 49.95 and $ 89.95.
The sellers must be on some heavy drugs.
And anyone who pays that much for some crappy VHS tape.
Should have their head examined.!!!!!!!!!!!
Because the amazon instant video is better then crappy VHS.
Any day of the week.!!!
And twice on a Sunday.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!update. I have rewatched the amazon instant video.
And it really is very high quality.
However. That does not change the fact that I still very much  want to see this film on BD.!!!!",1322006400,3,1391,4.387596899224806
521694,4,6302824737,"I haven't seen this movie in many years so I don't recall every nook and cranny of it. I just remember it being very suspenseful and I was on the edge-of-my seat watching it. As a child I didn't know who Siouxsie Sioux was but I'm now a huge fan!! In this world of so many crappy movies making it to DVD, why in the world is this excellent movie not available as of yet????",1304985600,6,373,3.986666666666667
521695,4,6302824737,"It is a VHS, so the quality is not great.  It does not come in anything but VHS at this point.  But this is a very 80s movie complete with a live performance from Siouxie, some cool clothes, underground L.A., and lots of action. Anthony Michael Hall is as good in this as he is in anything. I really enjoyed it then and still do, when I feel like reliving my 80's days. The soundtrack is great if you like more alternative/punk sounds of the 80s.",1281657600,,446,4.174418604651163
521696,4,6302824737,"loveable geek Anthony Micheal Hall is fantastic in this action film with some other soon to be great stars such as Jenny wright ( forest gump, the crossing guard, near dark ) and meat loaf to name a few. great action suspense and great to see the geek get to be a real man for a change, and the villian adds the weight needed to make Anthony's ressurection from geek to street wise player",1115856000,2,388,4.256756756756757
521707,4,6302824737,"The movie itself is great. However, the picture quality needs some work. Especially during the dark/night scenes, I could see a lot of pixilation going on. Nice to have, though.",1441238400,,177,4.933333333333334

521710,5,6302824737,Love it.,1424304000,,8,3.5
521711,2,6302824737,"Sigh. Another one of those 1980 movies, I enjoyed way back when, but just doesn't hold up any longer. The only reason it's managed two starts is because of Jenny Wright's presence in the movie.
Can't honestly recommend.",1417824000,,219,4.7894736842105265

521716,5,6302824737,I like this movie a lot... just a good movie with a good soundtrack. Hall does a really good job in this flick.,1398816000,,111,3.869565217391304
521727,5,6302824737,"I love this movie & remember seeing in the 80's because of Siouxsie being in it.  Whether you live in LA or not, it is fun to see the old Hollywood & AMH is great in it with the girl.  This has non stop action the whole movie & isn't goofy or too campy.  It reminded me of an old Dirty Harry movie with even more action.
This is when AMH went from cutesy teen movie to a more grown up, good looking & serious actor.  I am so glad that it was released as a digital download at least.
This movie was so under rated & hardly known about.  Yaaa, I LOVE this movie!!",1391731200,2,561,3.8434782608695652
521728,5,6302824737,I love this movie!!! Haven't seen it in years !!!! Awesome 80's flick !! A must see and must have !! Wish I could find a copy on Dvd.,1389398400,,133,3.6206896551724137
521729,5,6302824737,"This is an older film--note the format-that I have loved for years. Anthony Michael Hall (pre-DeadZone) is wonderful. The
premise is good: a Iowa farm couple/parents are experiencing a marriage crisis and splitting up. Dad goes camping, Mom to stay with a friend. Giving Hall her contact info, Mom transposes one number. Hall flies to California to stay with his married older brother. On the flight, he meets his first wild-child California girl, and at the terminal accidentally picks up a bag identical to his, but this one is full of drugs. When the drug dealers come searching for their bag, Hall goes on the run. This movie, in places gruesome or bloody, is mildly violent by today's TV standards. The tension is believable and well timed. Overall the film is gratifying to watch as Hall employes his own talents and strengths to outwit the bad guys and get the girl.",1384473600,,873,4.788079470198675
521730,5,6302824737,"I could never find it on dvd, so glad I was able to locate it on Amazon. I loved watching it as a kid and I still do.",1383264000,,117,3.2142857142857144
521731,4,6302824737,"The movie is very much as I remember it from when it first hit the theaters. I only give four stars because it is dated. Anthony Michael Hall has never gotten the credit that he deserves, but this role shows how he can morph from a hick Iowa farm boy to a street tough city kid in the same movie. The range he shows is shown here. It is the beginning of his road to his best role to date, The TV series ""The Dead Zone""",1375142400,,418,3.872093023255814
521732,4,6302824737,An enjoyable less known Anthony Michael Hall film Out of Bounds takes him from teen angst to a serious roll. For some reason this film is not available on DVD or Blu-Ray format.,1370995200,,177,4.393939393939394
521733,4,6302824737,"Critically maligned when released back in 1986, this action-thriller shows teen star Anthony Michael Hall breaking out of his previous image as a high school nerd. It's basically about any thing the can go wrong, pretty much does. Darryl Cage (Hall), a farm boy from Iowa, moves to Los Angeles following his parents separation. When in L.A., he hooks up with his brother and tries to start a new life. This all gets up ended, when Cage grabs the wrong duffle bag at the airport which contains over a million dollars worth of heroine which belongs to a ruthless and sociopathic drug smuggler Roy Gaddis (Jeff Kober). Cage's brother and sister-law are found by him the next day murdered, for which he is framed for. Now on the run, Darryl is pursued by Gaddis, corrupt cops and the L.A.P.D.. With the walls closing in on him, Cage turns to a young and wild actress wannabe named Dizz (Jenny Wright) with whom he first met on the plane. Cage and Dizz team up to clear his name and capture Gaddis along with his accomplices. For those who want a fun '80s action movie should find plenty to enjoy here. I watched this after almost 25 years, and it's still a fun movie that brings back plenty of great memories of my teen years. Since this is not available on DVD, this digital streaming format is  great for people who want watch it for the first time, or want to relive their memories like I did.",1362787200,,1392,4.480314960629921
521734,5,6302824737,"I saw this movie again recently, and it was as fun as I remembered it. It's a bit outdated of course, and Anthony Michael Hall would never be confused with an action star, but it just turns out to be a really intense thriller. Jeff Kober was brilliant as the villain, and Stewart Copeland's soundtrack really captured the time period well. He did the music for the 1980's TV series ""The Equalizer,"" and you can definitely hear that influence in this movie.

There is a real CRIME here that this movie hasn't, at the very least, been given a proper DVD release. I'm hoping for a blu-ray one day, but I'd settle for a well done DVD.",1360195200,2,630,4.384615384615385
521735,3,6302824737,"this movie was okay,but he has done better. The breakfast club and sixteen candles are his best works. I still like this one okay.",1356652800,,130,4.458333333333333
521736,5,6302824737,Loved Every Minute of This movie...A must see. Please release this on DVD or Blu-ray. Five Stars! 80's Classic. Fun Edge of your seat thriller.,1340496000,,143,4.76

7832155,5,6302824737,"I'll never understand why this movie isn't available on Blu-ray/DVD yet. It's a great film. Anthony Michael Hall gets to show that he's more that just ""the geek"". The supporting cast is very good. Out of Bounds is action packed with a good script to support it. The soundtrack fits the film well. I look forward to the day this film gets it's due!",1504310400,2,347,4.4375
7832156,5,6302824737,Ok movie.,1493596800,,9,4.0
7832157,4,6302824737,"I came across this movie when I was surfing through the Amazon videos.  It immediately made me nostalgic for the 80s so I just had to rent it.  I still love the premise of the movie and I think Anthony Michael Hall did a superb job.  But somehow, I thought it was better back in the 80s.  It was a little more believable back then.  Maybe that's a testament to how over produced most movies are in present day.  I gave it 4 stars because it was a great trip down memory lane but didn't give it a full 5 stars because it wasn't that believable and the quality of the film was not that good (it needs to be digitally re-mastered).",1479945600,,628,4.10655737704918

7832163,3,6302824737,"I watched this movie because I first saw it when I was a kid at the theater. It had to do with the nostalgia factor. It seemed highly unlikely that some guy from some small farm in Iowa had the street smarts to deal with a drug dealer in Los Angeles, but hey that's fiction for you.",1448236800,,282,3.9649122807017543
