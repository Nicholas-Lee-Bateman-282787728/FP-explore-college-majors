8341745,4,B001TK28ZK,"This tale of the Ethiopian diaspora in America mostly fit the bill for me. Previously I was unfamiliar with the Ethiopian culture. For the most part, the acting was good. However, Solomon did seem to meander a bit throughout the film. While his vision and actions regarding the cafe shop were clear, the rest of his life was not as defined, especially his ambiguous relationship with his previous live-in girlfriend. Hanna was a bit more developed as a character; her motivations were always clear.
Overall a good film for a quiet evening. However, I was not prepared for the brief burst of profanity uttered by the fashion photographer in the middle of the film. It seemed out of place with the rest of the film. The fashion agent,who had more reason to be angry, was tame by comparison. This prevented me from rating this film higher.",1278460800,2,836,4.732876712328767
