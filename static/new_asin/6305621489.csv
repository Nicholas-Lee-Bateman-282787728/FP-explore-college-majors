what happens in the movie is that these 3 scientists invent a program tat can make people like the ultimate fighting machine. and the evil terrorist, Alien kidnaps one of them and kills one of them's fiance.
filled with anger, ekin and fung(ill jus call him that) test out the program on themselves. so they can rescue their friend Kelly.
the program domake them super fighter. but there are side effects.....and.....
this movie dissapointed me because Hong Kong cinema in the late 90's has not made a well-made masterpiece yet.( maybe the young & dangerous, and storm riders....) Ekin cheng still is the man.",1015286400,,896,4.713375796178344

7892340,5,6305621489,THIS IS THE KINDA FILM THAT CONSTANTLY HAS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT AND WHEN YOU THINK THINGS JUST CAN'T GET WORSE THEY DO. IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING IT. EKIN GIVES A GREAT PERFORMANCE.  IF YOU ARE AN ACTION FAN THEN I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED.,947289600,3,285,4.0
7892341,4,6305621489,"A good,well acted movie with interesting characters. C.S.(Jordan Chan),Tango(Cheng Kee Yin),and Blue(Kelly Chan) are 3 agents working for the C.I.A.,(who also have been friends since they were very  young)specializing in a virtual reality training program that turns  ordinary people into great fighters. When C.S.'s fiance is killed and Blue  is kidnapped by an international terrorist named Alien,who brings her to  Hong Kong,C.S. and Tango decide to train in the v.r. program to rescue  Blue. After they rescue Blue,they still have to find Alien because he has  his own plans of causing riots around the world by using subliminal  messages. Blue and Tango learn from their superiors that the v.r. training  has a side effect on some of the trainees. The side effect is violent  outbursts,and C.S. expiriences this while searching for Alien. C.S. kills  off a bunch of Aliens henchman during a fit of rage. When the three agents  are ordered back to the U.S.,the C.I.A. tries to handcuff them and bring  them back to be brainwashed. C.S. while escaping accidentally shoots Blue  dead. This eventually leads to a showdown between C.S.,Tango(now brainwashed  and ordered to kill C.S.),and Alien. A good all around film. The gunfights  and fistfights are not the best ever put on film,but are still good and  refreshingly original. Kelly Chan is one fine looking lady.",944352000,4,1367,5.17351598173516
7892342,4,6305621489,"This is another film which The Matrix seems to have been in part inspired by. From the programming of ordinary men with fighting techniques to the VR training world, this really smacks of what would later be seen in the  box-office smash Matrix. Obviously The Matrix has the clear edge in the fx  department, but Hot War's action and design are not to be sniffed at. The  set-pieces are well executed and the numerous locations pleasing on the  eye, but Hot War's real advantage over the Matrix is heart. It has seemed  recently that Hong Kong films have tended to imitate Hollywood too much and  therefore lose the heart that made their films in the 70s and 80s great.  Hot War though borrows from Hollywood's big-budget feel, but remains a Hong  Kong picture. Ekin Cheng and especially Jordan Chan are excellent. Even the  westerners hired for the film aren't bad (see Mr. Nice Guy review!). With  all of these ingredients, Hot War stands as an excellent Hong Kong  actioner.",943920000,2,977,4.72189349112426
