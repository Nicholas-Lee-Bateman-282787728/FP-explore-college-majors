Maybe good for die-hard fans, but I don't think everyone who likes F&S would find this exceptionally funny.",1376524800,,245,4.951219512195122
7951467,5,B00005R1JJ,"We saw this show in Oxford with a sold-out house.  (Their entire tour was to sold-out houses).  Our audience consisted of equally older and younger men and women -- in other words everybody loves French & Saunders.  They are unique and brilliant comedy artists.  There has never been anything like this in the US.  Buy a region-free DVD player (they're not expensive), and enjoy these amazing women.",1232323200,,399,4.895522388059701
