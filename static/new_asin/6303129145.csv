586782,3,6303129145,"One of Lon Chaney Jr.'s best horror vehicles, ""Man Made Monster"" (1941) holds up surprisingly well for a B-movie quickie. Clocking in at 59 minutes, the film benefits from Chaney's sympathetic portrayal of the electrically-charged ""Dynamo Dan."" Lionel Atwill lends effective ""mad doctor"" support and director George Waggner keeps the proceedings moving at a good clip. It's an underrated Universal chiller worth seeking out.",1201392000,18,424,5.640625

586784,3,6303129145,"Man Made Monster is an excellent example of Universal Studios' work during the 1940s. This neat little B picture has great mood and art design, some good special effects, and excellent performances by Lon Chaney Jr. in  another of his sympathetic parts, and Lionel Atwill playing another of his  (almost) over-the-top mad doctor roles. Highly recommended.",955238400,13,355,5.321428571428571

There is a storm, a bus crashes into a power line pylon. All the passengers save one were electrocuted. Dan McCormick runs a carnival show to amuse customers, its all an act (phony). Dr. Lawrence wants to test Dan to see why he survived. Electro-biology is his specialty of research. His assistant Dr. Rigas runs experiments in the laboratory. Paul believes that electricity can power people so they can do more work. Science should better mankind. Dr. Lawrence wants Dan to work for him as a test subject; he will be paid and get room and board. When Dr. Lawrence is away his assistant runs tests on Dan. Are there after-effects? The dog Corky runs away! Shocking. The tests continue. Dr. Lawrence notices a change in Dan. He is told about the two dead goldfish. A blood sample of Dan shows changes.

Dan acts as if he was sedated. A visitor tells about mickeys, which have a similar effect. Dr. Rigas continues his tests. [Informed consent?] Now Dan glows and flickers. Will he follow orders? Dan must wear rubber gloves for insulation. Dr. Lawrence objects, Dan kills him! The District Attorney will investigate. Dr. Lawrences daughter tells the DA that Dan is too nice to commit murder. She thinks Dr. Rigas did something to Dan. Alienists question Dan about his background in an orphanage. [Is this satire?] The diagnosis is acute melancholia. [Is that black bile from the humoral theory of disease?] The verdict is guilty, Dan will be sent to the electric chair on May 29 (a Wednesday). But there is a problem: three shocks and he is still alive! Dan escapes, the warden is with him. The body of the warden is found, he was electrocuted.

A man tells where Dan is; hes wearing rubber boots. There is a search on for Dan McCormick. He is heading for Dr. Lawrences laboratory. Dr. Rigas boasts of his experiments with Dan. He wants to experiment on Dr. Lawrences niece! But Dan arrives to stop Dr. Rigas. The police arrive after Dan leaves with the niece. Corky the dog follows. A barbed wire fence grounds Dan, the electricity runs out of him. June shows the reporter the notes from Dr. Rigas experiment, then the notes are burned in the fireplace.

You can notice similarities between this story and the horror movies of the 1930's. A mad scientist creates a monster that threatens people, it then turns on his creator. [Is this a political statement?] The threat to people is ended in the last minutes. When this movie was produced WW II was ongoing, it had real horrors worse than in any Hollywood movie.",1474502400,,2541,4.677852348993288

7839936,5,6303129145,"An underrated Universal B Picture...MAN MADE MONSTER sums up the perfect combination of acting, monster magic and suspense.  What was supposed to be a 'vehicle' for Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff called ""The Electric Man""...became a collaboration between Lionel Atwill and Lon Chaney Jr.  Toss in a few Universal supporting players like Samuel S. Hinds (in a kindly role as the head doctor), atmospheric Charles Previn music, and this 59 minute movie is a keeper.  I still have the VHS tape of this, but it's worth a 2nd look on DVD.  Perhaps this was prep work for Chaney...who essentially played the same part in GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN?  (Bela Lugosi & Lionel Atwill were co-conspirators for that one).  MAN MADE MONSTER gets my 5 stars because of an excellent, slightly preposterous story...good acting and atmosphere.  Can you imagine what Boris and Bela would have done with this script if they hadn't turned it down?",1417392000,,920,4.973856209150327
7839937,5,6303129145,"Man Made Monster is Lon Chaney Jr's first foray into the world of horror and it's quite a step for him.. Successful one too, so successful that by the time the movie ends, you actually feel sorry for His character, who was transformed from a mild mannered carnival side show performer, into a maniacal killer, an Electrical Man, thanks to a mad scientific genius, Dr Regis, assistant to Dr. John Lawrence, who offered to help Dan McCormick (Chaney), the lone survivor of a bus accident, where all of his fellow passengers were electrocuted.
Dr. Lawrence assures Dan that he wants to find out why he's immune to electric shock, so maybe one day he can help the scores of people who are killed by electrocution each year.
Dr. Regis has no such plans, as soon as Dr. Lawrence leaves for a convention, Regis begins feeding Dan with large quantities of electricity, until he is able to sustain the full capacity of the voltage.
Dan breaks loose and is now a glowing, Electrical beast.....Dr. Lawrence, now home walks into the lab and realizes what Regis has done and tries to call the Police, Regis orders Dan to stop him, Dan murders the man who tried to help him and Regis tells him to admit that he did it,
There is a trial, he's found guilty and is put to death......in The Electric Chair!
The execution is carried out but doesn't quite go as planned and ends up re-energizing Dan once again and he escapes from prison, which leads to quite a climax, as Dan breaks through the rubber suit he is wearing that he got from the lab after he kills Regis, who was about to do harm to Miss June, he gets caught on a barbed wire fence and the electricity runs out of his body and kills him.
This movie wastes no time getting right into the story and it moves right along at a nice pace, don't let the 61 minute length fool you, it does a fine job of presenting the story within that time frame.",1399680000,,1885,4.404011461318052

7839939,4,6303129145,"Chaney's first horror film with Universal Pictures. I heard this was described as a test vehicle, to see if young Chaney Jr. had the chops to fill the shoes not only of his legendary father, but to see if he could become the studio's new horror man after Karloff and Lugosi.

He must have passed the test because it was not long after this that Universal put him in a little picture titled ""The Wolf Man"" where Chaney cemented his legacy as one of the all-time horror greats.

Getting back to ""Man Made Monster"", it's a pleasant B-Movie programmer, speeding along at barely over an hour & featuring a suitably sinister ""mad doctor"" performance from the always capable Lionel Atwill. And Chaney is excellent as the ill-fated & tragic Dynamo Dan, a type of character that he would portray again as Larry Talbot.

Hopefully one day, this Universal feature will get a standalone DVD release (fingers crossed).",1374710400,,905,4.751592356687898

(6.3) Man Made Monster (1941) - Lionel Atwill/Lon Chaney Jr./Anne Nagel/Frank Albertson/Samuel S. Hinds",1321747200,,899,6.176
7839941,3,6303129145,"Man Made Monster is directed by George Waggner and stars Lionel Atwill, Lon Chaney Jr & Anne Nagel. It's adapted from an original story titled The Electric Man which is co-written by H.J. Essex, Sid Schwartz & Len Golos. It is notable for being the first horror venture for Chaney Jr who would make his signature horror movie The Wolf Man the same year. Plot sees Chaney as ""Big Dan"" McCormick, the sole survivor of an electric train wreck. That all the other passengers were killed by electrocution fascinates the sci-fi boffins, particularly diabolic Dr. Paul Rigas (Atwill), who coerces Dan into a series of tests. The outcome of which will spell disaster as Dan absorbs huge levels of electricity and becomes immune to it. Soon Dan will become the unstoppable Electric Man.

Universal's Man Made Monster has no pretence what so ever, it is what it is, a short sharp shock shocker that plugs itself into the mains and lights up the screen for its 1 hour running time. Which in the case of the excellent Chaney Jr is actually the case, as he is transformed into a hulking, walking light bulb head that garners sympathy in the way that Universal's other man made monster did. The photography (Elwood Bredell) is moody and atmospheric, Hans J. Salter's musical score delightfully oozes familiar Universal values, while Waggner and his team, when one considers the short running time, do very good work on the characterisations; with Atwill given full license to be bonkers-real bonkers.

It's all very conventional in the grand scheme of Universal horror. Monster elicits sympathy, a foxy lady in the mix (Nagel), mad scientist, dashing hero type (Frank Albertson) and here we even have the intelligent pet. There's some smarts in the writing as the makers observe capital punishment and note man messing with things he probably shouldn't be. But really just don't go too deep with it and enjoy a solid little chiller that's boosted by John Fulton's first rate special effects. 7/10",1296345600,3,1982,4.895833333333333
7839942,4,6303129145,"Man Made Monster is one hour and one minute long and was released on March 28, 1941. This was Lon Chaney Jr. first horror picture and not a bad one at that. The movie starts off with a bus crash into an electrical pole. Dan McCormick (Lon Chaney Jr.) is the sole survivor. Dr. John Lawrence asks Dan to come to work for him. Dr. Lawrence wants to run some experiments on him and try to find out why he was the sole survivor on that bus accident. While Dr. Lawrence intentions are good, Dr. Paul Rigas are not. He wants to change Dan into this electric beast and create an army of them. Dr. Rigas finally succeeds in his experiments and in so doing order Dan to kill Dr. Lawrence. Dan is under Dr. Rigas control and has no will of his own. Dan's survives his on electrocution in prison and escapes. He heads back to the Moors and kills Dr. Rigas. Finally Dan meets his own death when his rubber suit rips and is electrocuted himself. There are some special effects, but nothing major. This is a good movie to watch or own.",1233446400,,1021,4.241025641025641
7839943,4,6303129145,"'Man Made Monster' is one of those little talked about gems from the Universal archives. Lon Chaney Jr. does what he does best and plays another very unfortunate soul who gets the short end of the stick. This is a good solid reworking of the Frankenstein idea with and few changes here and there. Chaney Jr. will never be remembered for being the brilliant actor his father was as in this film, his acting skills are good, but there as subtle as a heart attack as he goes from ""happy go lucky all around good guy"" to a walking zombie. In his defense, this film is very short(59 minutes)and there isn't much time to get fancy! No matter.....as it's always been a favorite of mine and I'm glad it's available now on DVD on 'Universal Horror' a 5 films set of old Universal classics. Look for it as a Best Buy exclusive for a limited time only.",1204156800,,841,4.3630573248407645
