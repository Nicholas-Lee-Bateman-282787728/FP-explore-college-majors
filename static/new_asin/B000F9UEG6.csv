8119406,4,B000F9UEG6,"If you can get past the very 80's feel of this video and keep in mind proper SIDS precautions, the content of this video is pretty good.  It basically teaches you the secrets of setting up the right sleep routines for your baby during the newborn phase, so that when you are ready to eliminate night wakings, the transition will be MUCH EASIER.  It also teaches their technique for eliminating the nighttime wakings when you are ready.

I like the SleepEasy Solution DVD better for teaching the technique for eliminating the nighttime wakings.  The SleepEasy Solution doesn't recommend starting sleep training until 4 months of age.  The main problem with this idea is that you've spent 4 months establishing terrible habits for your baby that you now have to break.  They call these bad habits the ""sleep stealers.""  I think these two videos can go together.  Use the Helping Your Baby Sleep video to learn proper sleep habits to establish in the newborn phase, then transition to the SleepEasy Solution when you are ready to end the night wakings.  Keep in mind that breastfed babies may continue to need at least one night time feeding.  You might try ""cluster feeding"" in the evening or a ""dream feed"" late at night before you go to bed to help eliminate that last feeding or at least push it off till much later in the night.

Finally, the video is not current with showing proper SIDS prevention practices, though it does offer a slide that mentions them.  For example, many of the babies are sleeping in cribs with non-breathable bumpers.  You also see loose bedding or stuffed animals in the cribs.  When the mother wraps her baby, she does not use a big enough swaddling blanket to keep the baby safe.  You get the point.  So, I certainly would not buy this DVD as a gift for anyone, but for your own reference on the above mentioned highlights, I do recommend it, but I would get it used.

Because I can't seem to find another video that emphasizes proper newborn sleep habits, this video gets 4 stars for making that emphasis.  I was going to purchase this through Amazon, but wanted it instant video style.  If you go to the producers' website, you can purchase a download there.",1389830400,,2191,4.644155844155844
8119407,5,B000F9UEG6,"We used this extremely valuable DVD to help our baby daughter sleep through the night.

The video is concise and clear. I watched the video several times, taking notes, then executed the four-night plan outlined in the video. By the end of four nights we had major, major improvement in sleeping (sleeping 5-6 hours at a time), and by continuing to follow the recommendations in the video, within another week our baby was sleeping the whole night through.

The video is *not* a delightful modern entertaining film--it is not designed to be. It *does* provides practical instructions that really work. This video improved our household mood and our baby's happiness so much! We have bought this video for several friends with newborns as well. I strongly recommend it.",1374451200,,768,4.9921875
8119408,1,B000F9UEG6,"I purchased this for my son and his wife for their new baby.  Both said I should have saved my money as there was no ""new"" information they could use.  Other parents might find it more helpful.  They said the program had a total 80's feel with old information.  The program showed babies being put to sleep face-down on a fluffy bed surrounded with toys.",1191542400,3,354,4.4
