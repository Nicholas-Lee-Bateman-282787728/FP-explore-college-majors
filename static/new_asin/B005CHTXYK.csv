4653328,5,B005CHTXYK,"This latest entry in the Robot Chicken saga is more of the unusual. Skits
come at you in rapid succession and almost never overstay their welcome.
I didn't really notice any picture quality difference between previous dvd's
and this blu-ray, but you don't get Robot Chicken for picture quality.",1334966400,,294,5.020408163265306
4653329,5,B005CHTXYK,"Finally, the first real Robot Chicken Blu Ray! (the other was just a special.) So, on of the awesome features of this BR is that you only have one disc. If you wanted to, say, sit down with a bunch of food and soda and do a non-stop insane Robot Chicken Season Five marathon, you COULD do that without having to get up and change the disc. You may have to get up and go to the bathroom though, especially after all that soda.

The commentaries on this season aren't as good as I remember ones from previous seasons being. They have too many people in the room and go off on too many tangents unrelated to the episode.

This season looks great and I'm really glad I went for the BR instead of the DVD. It's robot chicken. If you've enjoyed the last few seasons, then you'll enjoy this one. The special features are well done and even the menus are well done. Oh, and if I recall, it starts up without showing me 8 annoying previews, always a plus.",1326412800,,946,4.220994475138122
4653330,5,B005CHTXYK,"This was a gift for my husband for Christmas.  He enjoys Robot Chicken and didn't have this season, so I thought it was the perfect gift.  He's watched most of the DVD and he likes it (episodes are of the same caliber as other Robot Chicken seasons).",1325635200,,250,4.297872340425532
4653331,5,B005CHTXYK,I have to say that Robot Chicken is one of the most creative and hilarious things out there on TV.  The fact that they use toys I grew up with to do the animation is awesome.  Looking forward to season 6.,1323648000,,204,3.951219512195122
4653332,3,B005CHTXYK,I love robot chicken. It was a huge reason why id pay for cable for a while till the dvds started coming out and with subtitles they were WAYYY better!!! my biggest complaint on season 5 is NO subtitles.... that sux...,1320710400,2,218,4.341463414634147
4653333,4,B005CHTXYK,"I am a huge fan of Robot Chicken, and I still love the show. Season 5 is stil the Robot Chicken we know and love, although as far as this show goes I'd say this season is weaker than past seasons. The humor in this season is WAY more morbid than in past seasons, an not really as clever as the show has been in years past. Ether sketch this season seems to end with the characters being viscerally disemboweled, and even by this show's standards the humor in these episodes is a lot more vulgar. For some fans this is going to be hilarious, but for my personal tastes I thought Robot Chicken was at it best when it wasn't relying as heavily on base humor for laughs. In some ways, I almost miss the censor bleeps and pixelated nudity from older episodes, because frankly there's so much swearing and nudity in season 5 that it becomes distracting (which might be in the show's favor, since the actual writing in Season 5 isn't as good as earlier seasons).

Don't get me wrong-- season 5 is still a lot of laughs and makes some great pop culture jokes, and if you are a fan of the show it's still a must buy. However, I hope that going forward Robot Chicken doesn't continue in this direction, because eventually it can only end up with the show relying solely on obscenity to be funny, and that is not what made this show great. I guess every show that lasts this long is going to have growing pains, but I really hope that for Robot Chicken we're still a few years away from a true ""jump the shark"" moment (as if anything with this show would be absurd enough to make me tune out).",1320192000,19,1582,4.255813953488372
4653334,4,B005CHTXYK,wasnt happy that the following 6th season they only put out on DVD .... so this is kinda pointless really,1445299200,,105,4.3
4653335,5,B005CHTXYK,This is a very good season I loved it alot. Especially the end. My DVD was delivered on time and as described.,1444089600,,110,4.045454545454546
4653336,1,B005CHTXYK,"I wish I had known more about the show before I bought an episode.  I needed to wash my brain with soap after watching it.  I kept hoping it would get funny, but it was mostly disgusting humor.",1439164800,2,193,4.052631578947368
4653337,5,B005CHTXYK,Loved it.,1430524800,,9,4.0

4653339,5,B005CHTXYK,"Robot Chicken and Seth Green are becoming my favorite pop culture things to watch.  I love to see which REAL celebreties have lent their voices to the newest skits.  This season starts off with a ""Saving Private Ryan"" type scene.",1384819200,,229,4.7
4653340,5,B005CHTXYK,"Another funny and offbeat series that has crude and dark humor.
Hilarious, I've bought all the seasons so far, and I'll buy the rest too.",1379203200,2,137,4.52
4653341,5,B005CHTXYK,Robot Chicken is a fun show to watch if you want something to laugh at. I always been a fan of stop motion animation. This is mainly what lured me to watch this show. Some of the skits are crude or right out dumb. I had all the other DVDs and this was on sell for 10 dollars at the time so I couldn't pass it up.,1376092800,,312,3.671641791044776
4653342,5,B005CHTXYK,"This right here is my fav show from cable, I already have all other seasons and I'm telling you if you like pop culture you'll laugh your ass off",1367884800,,145,4.0344827586206895
4653343,4,B005CHTXYK,"In my opinion this season is better than the last one... but not by much. You will find a lot more blood, gore, nudity and cursing in this season. There are some sketches wich I find brilliant but overall that is not the case, It's still robot chicken and I have to say that the production has improved greatly. I enjoyed it, hope you do too.",1367280000,,342,4.196969696969697

4653347,5,B005CHTXYK,Best season out there!! My husband got me hooked to this show and we always make jokes of several parts of this series!  Very hilarious and we cannot just watch this show past 15 minutes without laughing out loud!  Truly hope there's season 6 coming up soon!!,1357171200,,259,4.48936170212766
4653348,5,B005CHTXYK,This season was so funny just like the rest of them:) And I have it on dvd and bluray just like the rest of the seasons and I think it was funny just like the rest of the seasons and star wars dvds:) I can't watch the 6th season yet cause i'm waitin for the dvd to come out:) Oh and this show is so genius just like Seth Green and Mathew Senreich:) The 2 original creaters of genius animated stop motion tv show ROBOT CHICKEN!!!:):):)The opening episode of robot chicken season 5(Saving Private Gigli} was so cool it was like world war 3 or some S***:) The 100th episode(Fight Club Paradise) was so incredible cause when robot chicken was fighting and killing everybody from season 1 through season 5 totally awesome:)I thought it was the end of robot chicken but of course you always have a way to continue the toy mayhem:)THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER:):):)!!!,1354924800,,859,4.443037974683544
4653349,5,B005CHTXYK,"I started to watch Robot Chicken as I got into college and the first few episodes I watched were really funny. So I decided to get the seasons on DVD/Blu-Ray and boy was it worth the money!! Not only are Seth Green and the rest of the cast geniuses at this show, they make everything so perfect. The characters are well designed and the scenes are just clever. I highly recommend this to any fan of Robot Chicken, Family Guy, or South Park. You won't be sorry!!",1353715200,,461,4.310344827586207
4653350,4,B005CHTXYK,"It's difficult to say what the appeal of ""Robot Chicken"" is...I guess that if you're like me, between 30 - 40 years old, chances are that you do remember the ""Masters of the Universe"", ""M.A.S.K."" or the ""Thundercats"" toys from about 25 years ago, right ? Well, on ""Robot Chicken"" you'll see all of them again and also much more. Is it still fun after five seasons ? You bet it still is!
Congrats to Seth Green and the R.C. crew for lasting so long while still remaining funny & wacky as hell. If you know what to expect, you surely will be enjoying the ride for the fifth time but people with a dislike for puppets (and/or the action-toys of the 1980's) probably better stay away from this...",1352073600,,692,4.372093023255814
4653351,5,B005CHTXYK,Bought this for my husband who is a fan from the beginning. He loves it. It arrived sooner than expected.,1347926400,,105,4.3

4653353,5,B005CHTXYK,"Got this for my nephew. Not a fan of gross humor usually, but got to appreciate Seth Green's genius. I already have the first four boxes. Thanks for the quick delivery, but why did you add customs brokers fee? Don't like being ripped off when goods to Canada are duty free anyway.",1340582400,,280,4.403846153846154
