8362588,2,B0013ZAVGY,A long and drawn out exercise in futility. This is a futile attempt to capture what ringside audiences see. Instead it feels staged and indulgent.,1356307200,,146,4.88
8362589,1,B0013ZAVGY,"Dragged out scenes of an athlete and models modeling. Not enough material about the art of photography, the photographer, the athletes, the sport or the models.",1325808000,,160,5.1923076923076925
8362590,5,B0013ZAVGY,"I know homoerotic when I see it and this is it. ""Knockout"" is one of the best examples I've seen since ""Playroom"" - ""Father & Son"" - and the last 20 minutes of ""Descent"" - to name a few. If you're looking for waxed Abercrombie twinks you will not like this. But if you appreciate rough and tough  looking - street smart men that workout at Gleason's in Brooklyn, NY then you'll enjoy this hour in your life. The filming of Joe Oppedisano's  photo shoot oozes with testosterone. One of my favorite scenes is with the two Peterson brothers from Florida. Tyler, 30 and Luke, 22. Luke is giving his big bro a buzz cut that is remarkable. His large hands gently touching Tyler's neck shows the brotherly bond between them. I also recognized ""Bruno"" from his Colt Studio days. He has aged v-e-r-y well. Joe has put together a piece of art that does exactly what he intended it to do.  I'm satisfied.",1216944000,7,893,4.432926829268292
8362591,1,B0013ZAVGY,HUGE Disappointment! This DVD did not deliver what was expected. Painfully slow moving. Tremendously boring. Nothing at all what the review discription indicated. A true waste of money and a gigantic waste of time. I strongly urge reconsideration before a decision to purchase this DVD is made. You'll be sorry. Honest!,1215302400,5,319,5.2745098039215685
