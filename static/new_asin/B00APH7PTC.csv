5463943,5,B00APH7PTC,"I loved this TV series. It was a big hit for about the first 3 seasons. After that, it started losing the correct type of TV viewers that networks, studios, etc. want. I thought the concept of a genius recluse billionaire creating an A.I. and rescuing or arresting ""Relevant Numbers"" (using S.S. numbers). The team consisted of the A.I. creator Harold Finch; the former Special Ops/Assassin who did the martial arts/fighting, etc. John Reese; the NYPD Detective who helped the team learn about criminal records, etc about the people, Lionel Fusco; another former Special Ops/Assassin who was also very deadly and who was one of my favorites Sameen Shaw; another hi-tech genius who loved Sameen and was close to Harold, Ms. Groves who was known for her name ""Root"" as in the root of a computer system. The first couple of season also had another NYPD, Jossalyn Carter who also helped the team save people, but was ""killed off"" the series as she went to do another TV series.",1497398400,,973,4.763313609467455

5463976,5,B00APH7PTC,"As a non-TV watcher, POI was the only TV drama I watched at a friend's place.  The way it ended wasn't very well done however.  90%+ of TV dramas/movies rely on sex scenes but POI did not resort to that monkey-intelligence, easy-to-get-attention approach, which I liked a lot.  Why do I have to be forced to watch someone else's bed scenes?  That is one of the dumbest approaches I know of.

Now, they took it off the shelf and I'm back to non-TV watcher.",1487721600,,455,4.369047619047619

5463989,5,B00APH7PTC,"When the CBS techno-crime thriller Person of Interest completed its first season in May 2012, I considered it the best new TV show of that year and of perhaps the past several years. Five years later, with the show now canceled, I still have the same opinion of it.

The second season of Person of Interest, which ran from September 2012 to May 2013, continued the story of Harold Finch, John Reese, Joss Carter, Lionel Fusco, a host of nefarious villains and of course, Harold Finchs Machine. At the second seasons start, a mysterious woman called  Root"" has abducted Finch. Reese is kept busy trying to find and rescue Harold, while at the same time dealing with the new irrelevant numbers that the Machine keeps spitting out. Meanwhile, Carter and Fusco have their own problems. They must deal with the sinister crime boss Elias and a new threat: a corrupt organization within the NYPD called HR. This cabal of crooked cops is working with Elias, and they all want Carter and Fusco dead.

All of this is brought to life through the superb acting of Jim Caviezel, Michael Emerson, Taraji P. Henson, Kevin Chapman, and many others. The scripts are, as usual, brilliantly written. As it did in Season 1, Person of Interests second season continues to engage and compel viewers with thrilling action-packed episodes that are frequently tinged with dry humor. Here is a show that poses serious questions about the intrusion of technology in our lives and its effects upon our right to privacy; and whether or not vigilante justice, even for noble ends, is ever justified.  Most highly recommended.",1483488000,,1595,4.852941176470588

5464044,5,B00APH7PTC,"Watched every episode of every series. Here's the scoop. The first series or two is individual stories but mid series 2 the producers realize they need to add some seriality (is that a word?) to some of the story lines......so that sub-plots linger through the season. Overall - it is totally awesome. The lead characters are great - superb rapport between them. I cannot say how much I have enjoyed every episode.

5464067,5,B00APH7PTC,"I found the second season of Person of Interest to be the best of seasons 1 through 4, which is as far as I have watched so far.  This is the season that least resembles a comic book, the actors have settled into their roles and seem more comfortable and well rounded, the plot is believable, and the progression is well developed, yet episodic enough for each week to be self contained.
Other seasons depend on a greater suspension of disbelief, yet the characters seem more wooden  and less developed, even the seasons after this one.  I have continued to watch, but as time goes on the nightmarish mood increases, John Reese becomes more of a superhero and less of a man, and I have actually found it to be an effort to watch some episodes,, not something I associate with suspense shows.
There is actually some humor  to the events of the second year, something the first year was too poorly developed to incorporate, and something which later years left out, deliberately I think.  Also, there are only so many fist fights, gun fights, and car chases / crashes, to show in the world, and these became repetitive and flat later in the series, year two was still fresh enough that there were surprises, change-ups, and even a little humor to be seen.
All in all, the series probably could have been completed in three years, with the heroes striding off into the sunset at the end. Instead, in an effort to create greater reality, the plot(s) became more rigid, paranoid, and plodding.  I feel the second year is the high point of the series, and I can recommend it to anyone.",1467417600,,1579,4.561837455830389

Can't go wrong with an adorable dog and skilled cast. As an added bonus, they introduced a new character this season, Sameen Shaw. While she's not around much this season, she is always entertaining when she is. If Joss Carter isn't enough to make you watch, I can't help you. Taraji P. Henson absolutely nailed it as Carter. Somehow they even manage to keep the nuggets we learn about Finch and Reese from feeling stale. I binged all four seasons in less than a week. So addicting. If you have no self-control, beware. This is one of those shows that has you saying ""It's not that late, I can do one more"" and ""There's only two left on this disc, I can finish it before bed."" And one more turns into hours later.

After a slow start, the first season eventually became compelling and absorbing.  I am one episode into the second season and am still enjoying it.

To enjoy POI you must not take it too seriously.  If you didn't enjoy the Minority Report, Terminator or the Vigilante movies, then don't buy POI.

After awhile the idea that the Matrix-like machine can see what criminals are thinking, despite them leaving no digital footprint will stop annoying you.  Then you can sit back and enjoy.

In summary, POI is just highly energetic light entertainment, combined with a warning about mass-surveillance.",1432512000,,696,4.888888888888889

5464216,2,B00APH7PTC,"About half way through season 2 is where this series lost me. It got repetitive and predictable to say nothing of how tiresome it gets watching Reese emerge as superman regardless of the odds. What made the first season a joy was the fact that you were discovering who all the players were and their motivations. Season 2 doesn't have that particular charm and the uncomfortable reality is that a show that revolves around a computer system can only be innovative for so long. There is no arch nemesis for Finch or Reese outside of the government and that begins to reduce the show to a formula that gets old fast. What is the real risk of exposure for the Machine? Nothing because at the end of the day, the information that is collected by Reese and Finch is out there to anyone who takes an honest look. I thought this show would do the impossible, create a real buzz around a show with a operating system as its main star but it simply can't be done.",1429056000,,954,4.395480225988701

In my opinion, Mr Caviezel is the best actor alive right now. Somehow he acts with his eyes and face, such sincerity, showing pain so exquisitely. His talent is truly a gift from God.

5464228,5,B00APH7PTC,"This is a truly unique and very interesting show that taps into the paranoia surrounding surveillance technology. But where this show differs from other cop procedural/vigilante shows is that it uses the surveillance technology referred in this series as The Machine is used to prevent crimes rather than the aftermath which most other shows have used. I missed this show when it appeared on Channel Five about 3 years ago, but have just recently caught on it on Netflix where I have binged watched my way through the 2 seasons available. It was a bit slow for me to get into but I found myself truly gripped from the third episode and have watched every single episode of the first 2 seasons. The first season sets up eccentric billionaire Harold Finch (Michael Emmerson) who has created a machine that predicts crime recruit a homeless man John Reese (Jim Caviezel), who has recently been caught up in a fight on a subway train with some thugs. Finch meets up with him after he has been bailed suffice to say Reese is no ordinary homeless person but a former CIA operative, who has been living in the shadows. Finch after an uphill struggle persuades Reese to join his crime fighting endeavor and the two become unlikely crime fighting partners. The first season sets Reese up as 'The man in a Suit' based on his description given to Law Enforcement, who the two attract attention from including a overzealous FBI agent, 2 NYPD detectives and the corrupt police body known as HR which covers the main body of these 2 seasons. The 2nd season builds on these threads with the standout episodes being Prisoners Dilemma where an imprisoned Reese (having been captured by the FBI along with 3 other perps in suits from the previous episode) has NYPD Det Joss Carter engage in Mind games to help him escape. POI is a show that grips right from the start and doesn't let go it makes you really care about the characters and is the best show on TV right now as it gets better with each preceding season. I have chosen to purchase the available seasons on DVD/BLURAY from Amazon and have already pre-ordered the 4th. This is a show that doesn't disappoint and even has some distinct diversity by having one the lead detectives played by celebrated black actress Taranji B Henson.",1427155200,,2272,4.6825

5464289,5,B00APH7PTC,"Person of Interest is a show that you cannot watch casually. You have to keep up, pay attention. The overarching narrative is ever developing. And despite the ""number of the week"" format, the show inexorably roots itself deeper into its own mythology. Season 2 divulges a seismic shift in cyberware, something that each viewer has probably suspected: The Machine is sentient. Further, it may harbor shadowy agendas all its own. In Season 1 we sort of got the gist that Finch and Reese were the puppets on a string, tugged here and there to investigate an ""irrelevant"" number produced by The Machine. Season 2 hammers home that Finch isn't much in control of his creation. The plot only thickens. Standing conspiracies present further obfuscation. Gratifyingly, this show is so well executed, and the glossy production values are on a near par with the big screen blockbuster. It's easy to pay attention when the product is this absorbing and addictive. Caviezel and Emerson continue to be fantastic leads, and Kevin Chapman as NYPD Det. Fusco is a hoot. Throw in, too, the magnetic, batsh-- crazy Root (Amy Acker), the very dangerous Sam Shaw (Sarah Shahi), the lovable attack dog Bear and the occasional appearance of the irrepressible, immoral Leon Tao (Ken Leung), the only victim/perpetrator whose ""number"" has come up three times - so far.

My favorite episodes of Season 2 (Plot SPOILER alert):

- Episodes 1 & 2 - ""The Contingency"" & ""Bad Code"" - With Finch abducted by the deranged Root, Reese discovers Finch's contingency plan. Bear and Leon Tao debut.

- Episode 3 - ""Masquerade"" - I've a fond spot for The Bodyguard with Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston, and ""Masquerade"" reminds me of The Bodyguard. In this one, Reese must play bodyguard to the spoiled daughter of a Brazilian diplomat.

- Episode 6 - ""The High Road"" - Reese and Zoe Morgan (Paige Turco) pose as a suburban couple. 'Nuff said.

- Episode 14 - ""One Percent"" - Reese has to protect a disdainful billionaire (Jimmi Simpson) who breaks all the rules and behaves so horribly that everybody wants to kill him. Simpson is so good in his role that you can't help but like him even though his character is a jerk.

- Episode 16 - ""Relevance"" - This is the one that introduced the badass Sameen Shaw. A brilliant episode that unfolds thru Shaw's eyes, sheds light on The Machine's day job, launches the Shaw-Root rivalry, and presents Reese and Finch as side characters. Here's a fun fact, if you dial 917-285-7362 - the number Finch hands Shaw - you'll get a voice recording from Finch's phone.

- Episode 17 - ""Proteus"" - A fun murder mystery. Trapped in a police station as a storm rages outside, Reese and Finch match wits with an elusive serial killer who takes on the identity of those he kills.

- Episodes 21 & 22 - ""Zero Day"" & ""God Mode"" - When the countdown reaches zero, the virus will shut down The Machine, after which it will reboot and grant Administrative access to whomever receives the call first. I love these two episodes. They advance the mythology, feature the return of Root and Shaw, culminate Finch's altruistic turnaround and reveal how he got his limp, and provide a really fun team-up between Reese and Shaw. Also, my favorite moments may be The Machine's calling out the location of arriving goons for Reese to shoot.

Special features:

- ""View from the Machine: 24 Hours behind Person of Interest"" - A behind-the-scenes featurette that observes a standard work day in the show's hectic production. This particular day covers the minutiae of the development, production, and completion of Season 2's final four episodes. Whew, there sure is a lot of brainstorming that goes on in this show. (00:21:21 minutes)

- Season Finale Episode Commentary with creator Jonathan Nolan, director Richard J. Lewis, and co-executive producer Greg Plageman

- Gag Reel (00:03:19 minutes)",1419465600,,3875,4.845688350983359

5464322,5,B00APH7PTC,favorite!,1417392000,,9,9.0
5464323,5,B00APH7PTC,"I first started watching this show when I found out that Michael Emerson from ""Lost"" was on it. He was that good. This is a really amazing show because it mixes reality with high tech, spy, action, and corruption. The premise of the show of a computer program monitor aspects of human life with the ability to collect and formulate data to predict terrorist acts while seemingly farfetched is a reality. When Snowden exposed elements of it--NSA programs like PRISM, Echelon, Trailblazzer, and Turbulence. Actual government programs that collect information and sort it out.

I grabbed the first season on blue ray when it went on sale for $19.99. I couldn't believe when another store priced the second season blue ray for less than the dvd edition. This past Black Friday week when another store dropped the price of the third season blue ray for $14.99, I went to several stores to find the only available copy.

You have to watch this show on blue ray otherwise you will miss a lot of the details. The first detail I noticed was the color of the square around a person represented the level of concern. White square represents irrelevant, yellow a person of interest to monitor, red is a threat, blue is an agent of the system. I have paused the screen to read the writing and that yields a whole bunch of information as to how the machine acts and evaluates. Unfortunately the writing is so small and goes by so quickly there is no way to see this on the fast motion broadcast. The high tech aspect of this show  is a level all to itself. But the scripts are so well written and the twists and the game within a game. J.J Abrahms has a genius level all to himself. With Lost, Alias, Fringe, and Star Trek-- I am so happy he is doing the new Star Wars.",1417392000,,1755,4.478125

Not having cable to watch TV and not able to watch on-line (thanks to Warner's idiotic decision not to allow streaming), I have to wait for the seasons to appear on DVD to catch up on the series.

But:  that also means that when a new season emerges, I can also go back and watch, if not the entire previous season, at least the last few episodes so that I'm fully up-to-speed for the ""new"" season.

Probably the only thing worth watching on television today (at least on network TV), I'm more than willing to wait for the next ""full season"" to be released.  On par with the early seasons of Lost, POI is truly a gem worth watching.",1416528000,,715,4.338345864661654

Just by chance I saw that I could get it on Instant Video on Amazon. This is one of the best shows I've watched in a very long time. As opposed to what one can find on network television these days, POI is an amazing, refreshing change of pace. I congratulate and thank CBS for daring to air a show that not just vulgarity, nudity, or mindless humor that other networks choose to present. The fact that it made it through to a second season is proof enough of its value. The character interaction and back story, along with the random twist and turn, make me glued to my PC so I don't miss anything.

5464407,5,B00APH7PTC,"Note: I saw every episode of this wonderful show via XFinity On Demand.

After a shocking finale to an excellent first season, could Season II live up to, and peradventure surpass, its preceeding season? The answer is YES< YES< and HELL, YES!!! With a strong premise, very good writers (which include series creator Jonathan Nolan, co-screenwriter of THE PRESTIGE, THE DARK KNIGHT & THE DARK KNIGHT RISES) and a top-notch cast (led by Jim Caviezel, Alexandre Dumas' The Count Of Monte Cristo, The Passion Of The Christ, Escape Plan, and the upcoming sports drama When The Game Stands Tall), it's a fool-proof recipe for success. And Season II delivers in every way, firing on all cylinders.

One of the season's best surprises comes in the form of a mysterious Englishman (John Nolan, the uncle of Christopher & Jonathan Nolan). After minor roles in III of his nephews' films, Mr. Nolan gets his chance to shine here, and he bites into this meaty role with Hannibal Lecter-like relish. He is one of the standout actors this season, apart from the stars of the show. Another standout performer is Sarah Shahi, who is introduced in an episode written AND directed by Jonathan Nolan. The clouds are forming on the horizon. There's a storm coming...

Of course, the series retains its family-friendly nature, with moderate violence/moderate language, no sexual situations, and clean humour that is genuinely funny.

PERSON OF INTEREST returns 23 September at 10/9 central on CBS with new episodes available the day after they air via XFinity On Demand and online at CBS.com.",1407369600,,1570,4.980916030534351

Looks like Abrams has another hit on his hands, kudos to the cast and crew, syndication is in your future. Another well liked series like Alias or Lost.
It's interesting in this day and age of uber surveillance to see a show that uncovers the governments interest in all their citizens as ""persons of interest."" Apparently we are all untrustworthy. The government and bureaucracy's misguided, if not illegal, efforts to track and record our everyday lives are exposed in this series. It reminds me of Communist Russia, Communist China or Communist East Germany during the Cold War; spies everywhere. Let's remember that two collapsed under the weight of their massive bureaucracies and the other has moved into the top dog position of global power brokers. I find Communism too rigid and oppressive. Will we citizens once again be granted the liberties and rights conveyed to us by our Constitution and Bill of Rights?

It speaks to the paranoia in all of us in a very creepy way. Season Two builds on the first season beautifully, and rarely has a dull moment. And Jim Caviezel isn't bad to look at, either! His low, menacing whisper is so.... well, interesting, shall we say? My husband teases me that he is the only reason I watch such a head kicking show.",1399075200,,497,4.344086021505376

5464495,5,B00APH7PTC,"This series deserves its popularity in many ways. All four lead characters are likable and earn our respect. The pace doesn't lag. The dialogue is realistic and intelligent. The main characters are engaged in a positive, expansive mission.

I particularly like that the female police officer is not a teenager wearing lip gloss and grown-up shoes. Too many TV female cops inhale their lines self-consciously - it's clear they haven't studied for their roles, or studied acting for that matter. It's just not credible that a female officer would lack will power and strong task focus. Good for Taraji Henson whose character, Detective Joss Carter, strikes the right balance - she's isn't always trying to show the camera how good she looks; she's tough and has a good heart.",1396828800,,773,4.992248062015504

5464520,5,B00APH7PTC,"Person of Interest - Season 2 [2014-03-08 511]

NO SPOILER COMMENTS!

  These remarks concerning the second season of the TV series ""Person of Interest"". I'm assuming the reader of these comments has seen all of Season 1 and has a firm grip on the plotting threads that wind there way throught this intriguing show. In order to fully enjoy the continuation of this fascinating story take the time to read the Wikipedia article on ""Person of Interest"".

  I will repeat myself because I feel strongly about this point - in my oppinion it is essential that the viewer have a clear knowledge of Season 1 to appreciate Season 2. Characters surface and then disappear for an episode or two only to reappear and play a key role later in the story.

  The complex interwoven story of Harold Finch and the origins of the Machine, who built it, how it works and exactly where it's located is just one of the threads that weave through this series in greater details in season 2.

  New opponents of Reese and Finch are developed, time-line background details start to make more sense and enemies from season 1 keep coming back, specifically Root, HR and Elias.

  Detectives Carter and Fusco continue to play pivotal roles in each episode.

  This is one of the most confoundedly interesting shows I have ever viewed and am looking forward to the season 3 set when it is released.

  On a personal note I cannot be at the mercy of juggled TV schedules and absolutely abhor commercials so I watch this and several other series on DVD where I can control when I see the shows and avoid the ads. One grip I have concerning POI is that the DVD's do not include any deleted or extended scenes. I just know they are ""somewhere"" and cannot understand why they are not included. OK enough said!",1394323200,,1777,4.574603174603174
5464521,5,B00APH7PTC,"This series just gets better and better. It is worth watching some episodes twice just for the subtle humor and nuances. The writers have done a fantastic job of creating two incredibly complex characters who reveal just a little more about themselves as each week passes. Love the fact that I can watch this with my kids as it is one of the few clean shows out there. Loved Burn Notice and this reminds me in many ways of it with the character interplay. Jim Caviezel is one of my favorite actors so it stands to reason that his presence in this makes it worth watching but he really nails the performance of Reese who gives new meaning to the term ""the strong silent type""!

Jonah Nolan is a great writer and producer. Really, though, credit for the outstanding, consistent production quality of Person of Interest has to go to Bad Robot, a post production facility in Santa Monica that gives Person of Interest its distinctive ""look, sound and feel"". Bad Robot has the best people, the best location, the best post production technology and a collaborative spirit unmatched anywhere. The environment at Bad Robot reminds me of Walt Disney Studios in the 50's. J. J. is a combination of Walt on the creative side and Walt's brother, Roy, on the money side.",1393545600,,738,4.912

I am not a netflix kinda person and the digital copies were super expensive compared to the dvds (Still trying to wrap my head around that concept). So I bought these dvds.

4 stars for the limited Bonus Features, and I despise the Ultraviolet concept as opposed to the digital copy included with other manufacturers.

The actors are very good, Fusco, Carter and Finch do not disappoint, and Mr. Reese, well he doesn't have to do much, his eyes say it allI love Zoe, and Shaw is a true blood psycho, so it has enough ingredients to last as long as any CSI or NCIS, and it's way better than the now boring Grey's Anatomy..I dread the third season, because the writers will probably kill someone off, and I bet it will be someone fans like and don't want to see deadbut wheat can we sayQuestion; Why don't these shows ever get mentioned in People's choice or Emmys?

I enjoyed him as the Count of Monte Cristo (though the Richard Chamberlain version is still my favorite), but he is so good in this role. Also, Harold (name a bird) is fun to watch as he reveals more and more about his past through little clues, as well as flashbacks. Chapman's Lionel Fusco is wonderful as a corrupt cop trying to repent and reform while saving him from his dark past is slowly corrupting Carter as their associate. The plotting is interesting though so many corrupt organizations are a bit difficult to believe.

5464623,5,B00APH7PTC,"We liked Season 1 of P/Interest. But Season 2 dragged at first (we're not fans of Root, altho it's beautifully acted by Amy Acker). We were toying with the idea skipping the rest, when Sarah Shahi was added. BRILLIANT! We loved Ms. Shahi in Fairly Legal, but her Sam Shaw character in P/Interest is the perfect match of talented scriptwriting and flawless casting. She is marvelous in the role of a killer even more cold-blooded than John Reese, deadpanning her lines with perfect timing.

There is not much to say about P/Interest that hasn't been said by other reviewers. It is a good concept brought to life by intelligent scriptwriting and excellent character development. This smart, complex, dark-yet-funny-moments-abound series is a real slap upside the head to idiot TV execs who aim at the lowest common denominator and seem to believe we need yet another underbrained fake reality TV show.

I can hardly wait for Season 3 to show up on DVD, although I'm really unhappy about the way it ended. Gggrrrrrr!

It had some techie stuff for its day and Micky Kozmyer was the technical side of the team.  The Person of Interest series reminds me of ""The Equalizer"" in some ways.  The hero has ties to the CIA and the sidekick was in the black ops.  Both work to help those in need.  I like the entire cast of PoI.  They all are believable.

5464651,5,B00APH7PTC,"I think this is an excellent, five star, show, but with some serious reservations.

First, it's network TV.  It's tied to the 40 minute 22 episodes, actors pause six times before commercial, form, and that's, to say the least, highly restrictive.  Think what Person of Interest would be like with the freedom of a cable show, like Boss or House of Cards?!

Second, within that restrictive form, it's sometimes too ambitious, trying to juggle too many plots in an episode or too many recurring villains, though they handle this second problem pretty well, with the exception of the HR crew whom I find annoying.

And third, a direct consequence of the full season 22 episode load, almost half the individual episodes are just schlock, if that's the word, or potboiler, if it's not: they're just filler, sometimes amusing, often entertaining, but almost sitcom quality, and not good sitcom.  These are all not intimately connected to the theme, which brings me to my last  reservation, perhaps the most serious, its limited thematic appeal.

Believe it or not, there are fans who don't like the basic theme, the perfection or divinity of the Machine, people who just like the characters, the actors, and the action and might take offense to my use of ""schlock"" above (and to whom I now apologize).  For me, however, the Machine is the best character, and that it was given a voice, independence, some kind of resulting 'life' in this season made the season far superior for me than the first, but if you have no sympathy with that premise, let's say that high theme, and just find it silly, it may also be annoying.

So, with these qualifications in mind, my judgment is this series, because of this second season, is excellent.",1386115200,,1726,4.800675675675675

5464661,5,B00APH7PTC,"""Person Of Interest"" continued its heroic, but uncomfortable look, into the ""security versus spying"" debate through the eyes of its two heroes, John Reese and Harold Finch; and the two police officers pulled into Reese's and Finch's adventures, Joss Carter and Lionel Fusco.  The core actors continue to work well together--Jim Caviezel carries the action as the ex-Army/ex-CIA operative Reese; Michael Emerson may be the most uncomfortable looking hero in the history of television as Finch; Taraji P. Henson is great as the driven dectective Carter, and Chapman continues to give heart and soul to the formerly dirty cop Fusco.
  This is the season where the universe of Reese and Finch expand in terms of the characters around them.  In the present day sequences, there's Zoe Morgan, the ""fixer"" who seems to have a passing interest in Reese.  Paige Turco gives a lot of fun to that role, and she's still incredibly pretty.  Ken Leung (Yep--another graduate of ""Lost"") has recurring turns as the grifter Leon Tao.  We cannot--just cannot--forget Bear, the Belgian Malinois that Reese takes from an Aryan Brotherhood in the Season 2 season opener, and wins EVERYONE--especially Finch--over.  The relationship everyone has with Bear...is one of the subtle points of humor this series has, along with Reese's dry quips and Fusco going on New York blast.  We understand the enemies of Reese and Finch at this point.  Enrico Colantoni's Carl Elias seems to evolve from enemy to gray area/support--the ""I'll scratch your back, you scratch my back"" relationship--with Reese and Finch; but HR--the group of corrupt cops most embodied by Robert John Burke's Patrick Simmons and Clarke Peters' Alonzo Quinn--increasingly push their way to the being the most enduring enemy of the series thus far.  Reese's CIA backstory wraps up in this season, so the Mark Snow/Kara Stanton (Michael Kelly and Annie Parisse) storyline ends...for now.
  What we get this year are two subjects--an increase in the telling of the backstory of Finch; how Harold and his business partner Nathan Ingram (Brett Cullen) invented The Machine and how Ingram first understood the importance of the non-relevant numbers, subsequently originating the proactive approach to preventing crimes that Harold was drawn into, and how Finch's newfound purpose ended up affecting his relationship with Grace Hendricks (Played by Emerson's wife, Carrie Preston).  The second storyline is the organization The Machine is tasked to--the ISA--taking in interest in the activities of The Man In The Suit, and looking to eliminate him.  Jay O. Sanders as Special Counsel--the person overseeing The Machine--gives a lot of nasty to the role, and Boris McGiver as the ISA hitman Hirsh is stone-cold.
  Amy Acker returns late in the season as the unstable Samantha Groves--Root--who believes that she and The Machine have some sort of special relationship (She might not be wrong), and Sarah Shahi is introduced as the former ISA operative Samantha Shaw.  I've always liked Shahi, who hasn't been afraid to play away from her looks as an actress.  In Shaw, Shahi plays a slightly unbalanced former spy who might be a little too trigger-happy for Finch...and for Reese.  Both Acker and Shahi have become part of the Season 3 regular cast.
  Overall, the storyline of ""POI"" seems to fill both in the present day and with the flashbacks.  How the flashbacks are introduced leads to part of the ""delicious discomfort"" of the series--the feeling of being watched while watching how things develop.  It's a relevant topic, but it's done with great action and a surprisingly good humor that makes it a can't miss series for me.
  Highly recommended.",1385337600,,3688,5.156302521008404

Stands proudly with the other great shows I mentioned. Reese and Finch, odd couple that they are, move and at like a fine Rolex watch. The other characters add to the intense action and nerve-wracking stories. Newcomer Shah just fits right in and is an extra added addition to this already great show. ONE QUESTION - is it me or does it seems strange that these types of shows never receive the recognition they so truly DESERVE!!!! Never an Emmy nomination. Strange, don't you think. But the TV industry continues to applaud and recognize Survivor, The Amazing Race, and the other pieces of garbage they call television.",1383609600,,779,4.901515151515151

Not long now before you won't be able to wipe your backside without someone knowing the brand of toilet tissue you use.  Sorry.  Had to say it.  But this story line is totally feasible.

5464687,4,B00APH7PTC,I have always liked this show because there are different cases that the main characters played by Jim Caviezel and Michael Emerson try to solve even though they are not police officers. They do that by trying to help people whether they are victims or perpetrators whose social security numbers come up on what these guys call the Machine. This show is awesome. These main characters always get the job done and the detectives played by Taraji P. Henson and Kevin Chapman also help Caviezel and Emerson out.,1383177600,,508,4.784090909090909

I like the casting very much. Sarah Shahi and Annie Parrise have been great additions along with the recurring appearances of Paige Turco.

The discs themselves are of shoddy quality however. I have my 2nd set and it is just as bad as the first set. One or more of the discs is difficult to load on my DVR. My Netflix discs and other discs have NOT presented these problems.",1381795200,,547,4.525252525252525

Jim Caviezel was my favorite character, I thought he would have been the best Jack Reacher, in place of Tom Cruz and in any future Reacher movies (until I read his political affiliation, bah humbug).  I still love the show, Mr Finch, Detective Carter, Detective Fusco and last but not least, Bear are now all favorites.  If they don't add too many unnecessary murderous women the show will still be my favorite (in spite of politics).

5464725,5,B00APH7PTC,"Let's see if for ONCE I can love a new show and not have it be prematurely cancelled out from under me LOL
As much as I enjoyed S1, S2 fleshed out the characters and introduced some new twists (and background) that made the show both more mysterious and more familiar, if such a combo is possible. It's like you find out one new thing, only to then discover 2 new things to wonder about going forward. I like that dynamic.

I like the ""formula"" for the show... that each episode is its own story, but set against the larger ever-unfolding plot lines. I like that there isn't just ONE, as others have alluded to. There is the machine itself-- past/present/future, but also Elias and HR, and learning the back stories of the main characters. So there is enough long-term fodder to keep it from being overwhelmingly about ONE thing ala Monk or Mentalist.

As an aside, it's kind of fun to see so many characters from the Lost series. I knew at the beginning that Finch was Ben from the Lost series, but after watching later seasons recently, I realized that Fusco was also in Lost (as a minor character) and Leon Tao was Miles.",1381276800,,1124,4.451456310679611

Though sometimes relying a bit too much on the supposed IT skills of one, and the martial arts of the other, the show mixes increasingly recurring characters (cops, Zoe, Leon... and Bear) and new comers. The background is sometimes hinting at The Wire (deeper intrigues, politics, corruption), but stays on the easy watching and action side.

Just like candies, it is nice to have a few, but not too much at the same time ! :)",1381104000,,568,4.68

5464742,5,B00APH7PTC,"From the beginning episode of season 1, I was hooked on this show.  It's a nuanced series of tightly plotted stories with a running series of subplots that slowly build from the beginnning.  The individual stories are not always what they seem - from the outset, the viewer knows that not all the people Reese and Finch try to help are victims - quite often, they are the perps that Reese has to stop before they commit whatever crime they have planned.

Of course, there are some clunkers but even the bad shows are superior to a lot of the dreck currently being aired on TV - broadcast or cable.

Before the show premiered, Jonathan Nolan, the series creator, called it Batman without the cape.  And, like all good hero/anti-hero franchises, this show has its own support 'family' as well as a marvelous rogues gallery with some enemies fixed seemingly permantently in the mythos and others appearing and eventually being handled.  Some, such as Elias, a mob boss out to control the NY rackets, start to slip into the show with mentions episodes before the character appears.

Many of these allies and rogues carry on into the new season which successfully opened with the resolution to the season 1 cliffhanger.  The flashbacks continue to reveal the backgrouds and motivations of Reese and Finch as well as the supporting cast - good guy or bad guy.  Fortunately, unlike producer JJ Abram's earlier success ""Lost"", this are much more defined & explain more - propelling the episode along.  (I love ""Lost"" but the flashbacks and flashforwards did get a bit confusing.)

I watched season 1 again then season 2 before season 3 premiered (several mini-marathons involved).  Each time I watch it, I see or hear something I missed before that enhances the show.  Some even have significance as the series goes on.

This is one of the very few Must-See shows for me.  And the only one on one of the big 4 networks.

And I'm already planning to buy season 3.",1380672000,,1954,4.702941176470588

5464744,5,B00APH7PTC,"The Second Season got especially interesting when two new characters, Root and Shaw entered the series for what may be an extended stay.

5464746,5,B00APH7PTC,This series continues to follow John and his friends through harrowing saves and near misses.  It provokes serious thoughts as to the over reach of government and to what limits should be placed upon government.  Is it alright to have everyone under surveillance?  If so when do you act to protect them?  The series probably hopes to illustrate how some government intrusion is worthwhile but you might want to watch before you make that decision.,1380153600,,447,4.92

5464749,5,B00APH7PTC,"Like so many others have written, I agree with everyone. This show is addicting, spellbinding, and I can't wait for the next show or the next season. The episodes and the writing leave questions at the end of most episodes. Sometimes those questions are answered in the next episode and sometimes we have to wait for another season or just wait, period. I record each show and I buy the blu-ray when it comes out. I have nothing much more to say except, if you have not seen this show, don't start in the middle, start at the beginning. I have met people who did not care for the show becasue they did not like Jim Caviezel, but myself and my wife have been a fan of Caviezel since he was a youngster playing small roles in movies such as GI Jane. He also has had his own starring roles in movies such as Frequency (which took me a long time to get to it, but loved it) and The Count of Monte Cristo. The second or third episode of the first season, when we met Elias, there was a subtle mention of The Count and it was quite humorous. And of course his role as Jesus in The Passion was superb; whether you are a Christian, religious, or not, the movie was powerful and so was he.

But only, apparently, in NYC and environs. (Sure. Lotta of good actors looking for work.) But the acting is excellent. (Michael Emerson is a lesson in how to act for the camera.) The writing is tight. The location work is great. And in addition to Carter and Fusco (cops), they seem to be building a team that includes super-fixer Zoe and weaselly super accountant (!) Mr. Tao.

5464758,5,B00APH7PTC,"This series is so well-conceived and written, characters are well-defined, by a detail-packed story line fleshed out by time-interval scenes that take place ""before and presently."" James C. is an immensely attractive lead man, underplays the part in a most fetching manner. His co-star, the character Harold, is also wonderfully played - the kind, sweet, tough, brilliant and surprising little multi-millionaire....peripheral, reappearing characters are also beautifully drawn.

And ""what if"" such a machine existed, one that could give us information in advance of criminal events ....""what if""? The larger ethical questions posed by the plot are demanding: do we have the right, the privilege, to prevent 'crime' before it happens? To alter the course of history? Would anyone who comes in contact with or who knew about such a ""machine"" be ultimately corrupted by it?
Are these issues similar to those presented by the Tom Cruise movie ""Minority Report""? Somewhat, I think, but ""Person of Interest"" demonstrates a high level of humanity, ethical and philosophical consideration with lower individual ego values - the concept of ""being in service to the greater good"" dominates, in my view.",1379203200,,1192,5.408602150537634

5464767,5,B00APH7PTC,"I have ordered discs of TV shows from Amazon in the past.  You know how it works, the DVD comes out on Tuesday, and you get the set about Friday or Saturday.  I pre-ordered the Person of Interest, season 2 set in MAY.  It became available on Tues, Sept. 3.  We noticed, on Wednesday, that it hadn't been shipped yet. And not on Thursday.  So I went to my friendly neighborhood store and paid almost the same amount of money and got the DVD's because I had been waiting and waiting...for months for these DVD's.  I watched a lot of episodes over the next few days.  And today, the 10th--after calling and complaining and having one of the nice people on the phone speed up the shipping so it came faster--it finally arrived.

The funny thing is, that I read a review for a different show and the customer had the same problem/complaint.  I didn't think much of it, since it had never happened to me before.

So, this is what I learned and what I will pass on to other customers:  if you REALLY want the dvd set, don't get it from Amazon.  I wouldn't have cared if it came later that same week, but it hadn't even been shipped that same week.  I was told it was because I had free shipping.  Free shipping means free shipping.  Not, it's free but you are penalized for not paying extra when the company offers free shipping on items over $25.

We buy a lot of things on a regular basis from Amazon, and we always order in a timely fashion so that we are not desperately waiting for an item to arrive.  I think I was a little more desperate for this item than I thought.

Oh, and the show is wonderful.  I can't wait for season 3 to start, and I will buy that season's dvd's from a brick and mortar store. The day it comes out.  And no more feeling abused by Amazon shipping practices.",1378771200,,1782,4.231454005934718

5464779,5,B00APH7PTC,"Premise:  After the terrorist attack in 2001 the government hires an IT company to create a machine to search for terror plots by spying on everyone.  The surviving creator (Finch) of The Machine takes the data the government calls irrelevant and seeks out the unsuspecting people involved in 'machine predicted' life changing events.  Some of the people are potential victims and some are the perpetrators of these events.  Finch, with his batman, Reese, sort out who is who and attempt to prevent the situations from turning deadly, serving justice when necessary.  They are helped periodically by NYPD detectives Carter and Fusco.

Who could have guessed when this program initially aired in 2011 that it would turn out to be true.  With the recent revelations about the NSA spying on all of us, it is unfortunate we don't have a real life Reese and Finch keeping watch.

The ensemble of actors brought together in this series is amazing.  Being a long time fan of Jim Caviezel, watching the pilot was a no-brainer for me and I haven't been disappointed.  Reese has limitations which is refreshing in the hard-to-believe-world of '100 lb women taking down 300 lb men without breaking a nail' TV shows.  I have been impressed by the other members of the cast as well.  Michael Emerson consistently maintains his character's physical limitations-no small feat;  Taraji P. Hensen's and Kevin Chapman's chemistry as police partners is believable-no goofy ""whatever you do is alright with me"" antics, just pure drama.  The writing so far is superb, serious but with a touch of dark humor that mirrors real life LEO's and SpecOps members.  The antagonists have been refreshingly unpredictable as well.  If you are a fan of any of the actors, you won't be disappointed, if you like thrillers, you won't be disappointed.  If you work for the NSA/CIA, you might have issues with the show.",1377475200,5,1882,4.942675159235669

Redemption and helping sometimes seem to be at polar opposites (""Thank you for giving me... a second chance"") but this show has thematic elements that not only keep me wanting to see and know more, but have me wanting to give them the help they need to help others. It's a rare show that not only invites you in, but also makes you feel a part of the story in your desire to make a difference. ""Pay it forward or pay the penance?"" Your choice or past may determine the tag or cost, but I love the idea that you can seek to help someone else...no matter what your past may tell or hold over you.",1377388800,4,672,4.137404580152672

Couldn't quite wait for the DVD issue of Season Two, and was depressed, so tried Season Two on Amazon streaming video.  Perked me right up!  Sound is adequate, but not anywhere near the DVD sound quality; picture quality is adequate, but not quite up to Season One on DVD.  Some shows on DVD have inferior picture quality to what Amazon streaming video delivers, like the last season of CSI Miami, which I bought on DVD, but couldn't tolerate watching because of the blurry picture.

There were a couple of ""weak"" episodes at the start of Season Two, that had me a bit worried, but then the writers picked up their game, and Season Two, PERSON OF INTEREST proved itself to me every bit as awesome as Season One.  And Jim Caviezel has the best ""whisper"" on TV.

Finch was made to look like he purposely tried to hurt Reese. A horrible unredeemable psychopathic character (Shaw) we are supposed to cheer for and like was added. Fusco disappeared for the last two episodes (both tied for the lowest ratings of the series) to make room for Shaw. Carter got a crappy B story to put Shaw by Reese's side for those last two episodes too. We had to deal with one-note Root and her ""its time to go see your machine Harold"" line over and over again.

Shaw is a nice addition. Leon adds comic relief. The only one I am not crazy about is Root. I wish that they would kill her off as she's annoying.

I like the whole idea of altruism with Reese, Carter, and Finch and the idea that people who do bad things can change to do good such as Fusco. I'm completely addicted to POI and have had to watch some of the episodes of season two a couple of times as it does become mind bending.

Looking forward to season 3. I think the show will last up to 6 seasons, and probably should not go much beyond that, as X-files did and Dexter.

5464849,5,B00APH7PTC,"I think this is a marvelous show. Who would have thought that TV writers could ever teach movie writers a thing or two. Of course, it is not really fair to compare TV and movie writing. Movie scripting is much, much harder than TV scripting. A movie writer must do so much in a few hours whereas a TV writer is not pressed by the same economics of time constraints. However, TV writers are getting better and better whereas movie writers of great talent are so rare as to be almost non-existent. Person of Interest obviously has a great writing team. But despite my opinions about writers, and they are opinions, it is the writing on this show which gives the actors such a great country to bring to life. And they bring it to life!!! The universe being created by the writers and actors of Person of Interest is truly interesting and timely. But my last words are for the actors. The two leads are superb. The supporting roles are superb. Vicarious adventure is to be had no matter which of the four main actors you want to live through for a very enjoyable 45 minutes or so.",1372550400,4,1076,4.4120603015075375

The main protagonist is clearly based on Mack Bolan, a.k.a. the Executioner, the top-selling action-adventure book series, so if you are fan of those books, you will like this show as well.

5464855,5,B00APH7PTC,"I first found out about the show, ""Person of Interest"" by accident via Wikipedia. When I read about how it involved a former Green Beret/CIA operative using his skills to prevent violent crimes, I was already interested (I love movies/shows like The Bourne Series and 24 where highly-trained former soldiers/agents put the smack down on bad guys), but I figured I wouldn't be able to watch it 'cause I didn't have TV and it wasn't on Netflix. Last Christmas, when I saw the first season on DVD, and I bought it. I was instantly hooked and practically devoured all the episodes. I quickly realized that Season 2 was going on, but I despaired because there was no way to catch up with the episodes.
Fast forward to a few days ago, I checked on Season 2 on Amazon to see when it would come out on DVD, and I found out - much to my joyful surprise - that I could purchase the episodes on Instant Video. So that's exactly what I did.
I am very happy to say that Season 2 does not disappoint. If you loved the high-speed action and tech savvy of the main duo (along with the aid of their friends in the police department), then this is a continuation of that, and more. The characters develop further as the season progresses and we find out more about them, the overarching conspiracy comes back but is deeper and more expansive, and we see many familiar characters as well as new ones - all of whom help enrich the story.
I can fairly say that I will probably buy the DVD set when it comes out, so that way I can update my collection (I already have Season 1 on DVD) and watch the episodes when I don't have an Internet connection. Plus, my connection isn't the best, so quality fluctuates and I oftentimes had to wait for the video to buffer oftentimes, so owning the season on disc will be a huge plus.
Meanwhile, I am genuinely excited for what Season 3 will have to offer. Season 1 left us with a cliffhanger and lots of questions, and Season 2 continues the trend, so I am definitely amped for whatever comes next.

TLDR: if you liked Season 1, you'll love Season 2. More action, new characters introduced, old ones fleshed out more, conspiracy is revealed more. Will buy on DVD as well.",1371945600,36,2188,4.389162561576355
5464856,5,B00APH7PTC,"I have been a fan of this series ever since the pilot episode has been released. From this point on, Thursday nights have always been the most enjoyable night of my life because this show keeps me satisfied at 9:00 PM. I love the way Season 2 goes in-depth more about the character's past and their motivations for doing what it is that they do. Not only this, the theme of saving lives and helping others always comes down from their hearts. Their altruism should be a perfect example of what society should be doing for others.

Reading other reviews about this product, I feel that the majority of people complain about the pricing of this show. I agree that it is expensive, but then again, DVD's about a particular show has to be expensive, since there are more than 5 disks filled with episodes and special features that we love watching after the final episode. Not only that, Person of Interest grows in popularity each day and referred this show to many of my friends and they too love it. As for the high-price complaints, you just have to pre-order the product. When I first pre-ordered this product and Season 1 of Person of Interest, I had to pay at $35.00 for the first season and now $41.99 for the second season. For those who haven't pre-ordered yet or was too late in pre-ordering this product before the prices jumped to $50.98 you're SOL.

Taraji P. Henson, who is a super talented, Academy nominated, and veteran actress adds to this PERFECT dynamic of a MAIN cast ensemble.

5464866,4,B00APH7PTC,"NO SPOILERS:

Let's get right to it.  What makes Person of Interest work is the phenomenal cast.  Perhaps the best on network TV.

Starting with Jim Caviezel (John Reese) and Michael Emerson (Harold Finch).

Who can forget Kevin Chapman (former Providence Irish mob boss) and the corrupt cop Lionel Fusco (offered a chance at redemption by Reese).

Thrown into the mix are a trifecta of hotties with recurring roles:

1.) Joss Whedon alum Amy Acker, as elite hacker with an agenda, ""Root""

2.) Fixer and sometime Reese love interest ""Zoe"" played by Paige Turco

3.) Less us not forget Sarah Shahi playing somewhat out of character as, stoic & burned former goverment assassin, ""Samantha Shaw"" Admittedly, I had hopes that we would at least catch Shahi coming out of cold shower!

Now for the boys.  Enrico Colantoni (Flash Point and Veronica Mars alum) as imprisoned mob boss Elias. Surprisingly endearing and adding some comic relief is Leon Tao (Ken Leung), as the often troubled financial hacker who sometimes assists in cases.

OK, so with a great cast, why not 5*?  The culprit is the writing/script.  IMHO, season 2 is much superior to season 1.  Starting with episode 14 (season 2) the script catches up with the 5* cast.  There is intrigue on several levels with Root (Acker) meeting Shaw (Shahi) in episode 16.  Episode 19 may just be the best episode of the series with several storylines coming together.  Elias admits that some outside force is posturing to take him out, Shaw re-emerges and decides that she will go after Root for some answers and then there is the re-emergence of the mysterious Englishman who is a point person for a shadowy organization, which has yet to be revealed.

I am very exited for the final 3-episodes of the season.  Fans will be excited to know that Person of Interest has been renewed for 3rd season.",1365206400,37,1845,4.7784810126582276
