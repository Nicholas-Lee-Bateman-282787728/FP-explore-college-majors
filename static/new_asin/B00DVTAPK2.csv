8598442,4,B00DVTAPK2,"A dusty, sweat soaked desert hats off to Elijah Collard for rounding up so many people with a passion for the history of Death Valley. Mr. Collard has blended an informative narration with still images and motion action that keep the viewer's attention without overwhelming details. The various historians humanize the story by stirring up the flavors of the Forty Niner characters who narrowly escaped The Valley of Death.

The epilogue is as valuable as the main production because it highlights the life of Leonard Collard whose determination inspired his son, Elijah and others to not only mark The Death Valley Escape Trail but produce this exciting story for future generations to enjoy for years to come. This production is a fitting tribute to the original women, men and children who ventured through Death Valley in 1849.",1460592000,,831,5.065693430656935
8598443,5,B00DVTAPK2,"This is a fascinating documentary about some very brave men and pioneering families. Essential viewing in schools and for all those interested in nineteenth century US history.

8598444,4,B00DVTAPK2,"This documentary film retraces the footsteps of the famous Death Valley 49ers, lost and starving in the desert, and the first settlers to pass this way.  It is about their 1849-1850 exodus from near death in Death Valley.  Author LeRoy Johnson leads a group of hikers from the heart of Death Valley, over the rugged Panamint Mountains and completes a 6-day Journey to Indian Joe's Springs.  It is a most intersting film.  It chronicles the journey of the famous escape route taken by Manly and Lewis to rescue fellow members of the Bennett-Arcane party.  This is a must for anyone interested in the history of Death Valley.  I am very glad I purchased it.",1377129600,3,655,4.701754385964913
