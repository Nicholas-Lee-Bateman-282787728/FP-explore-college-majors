5969073,5,B00F76L0C4,"Is Allyson Dougherty guilty or not? It's a simple question at the heart of The Advocate. But the bigger question is what will her attorney Ray Shekar do once he finds out the truth. And how far will he go to find the truth? The Advocate poses an interesting moral question: Can there be absolute justice? It answers it in a thrilling and thought provoking way.

Having seen so many of these low budget thrillers over the years, this ambitious movie stands tall. Not only is the story compelling, it looks great, with an amazing score and incredible pacing. By no means is it perfect, but one can't really compare low budget films with big budget studio fare. A really interesting part of the story here is that these are first time filmmakers with limited resources. What they produced was amazing, and I can't wait to see what they do next.",1385164800,3,841,4.569536423841059
5969074,5,B00F76L0C4,Great legal thriller with lots of plot twists until the very end!  It definitely keeps you engaged during the entire movie and talking about it afterwards.  Sachin Mehta gives a fantastic performance as the main character.  A must see!!,1384905600,2,236,5.0
5969075,5,B00F76L0C4,"I'm a huge noir fan and decided to check out this indie film at the Hungarian Film Festival in North Hollywood.  As a criminal defense attorney, I'm usually pretty disappointed by the woefully inaccurate and implausible plot devices that a lot of films and tv series employ for dramatic effect.  This movie not only had some truly cool Hitchcockian twists and turns, but it used some really sophisticated legal maneuvers which I thoroughly enjoyed.  First time star Sachin Mehta really nailed the role, too -- dark and brooding, he's a guy to watch out for.",1384819200,2,557,4.842105263157895
5969076,5,B00F76L0C4,"Watched this movie at Dances With Films Festival in LA several months ago. It is a dark twisted tale of a defense attorney who takes on guilty clients and gets innocent verdicts... for a price. When he accepts a new  sexy client, he finds himself no longer emotionally disengaged. Add to the mix a humiliated cop snooping around which amps up the pressure in this taunt psychological tale of justice, remorse, and revenge. Highly recommended.",1384300800,2,442,4.8933333333333335
5969077,5,B00F76L0C4,"I watched this movie at a film festival in Los Angeles and what a surprise of such a great film.  All the plot twists kept it suspenseful and exciting.  If you like a good thriller with a great plot that keeps it real, definitely watch this one!",1384041600,,245,4.191489361702128
5969078,5,B00F76L0C4,I saw this movie at the AMFM fest in Palm Springs. Couldn't get the story and performances out of my head. So happy that I'll be able to watch it at home and share it with some friends.,1383868800,,185,3.8947368421052633
5969079,5,B00F76L0C4,This is a very enjoyable movie - great characters (the main character is quite complex) and exciting plot twists.  Highly recommend!,1383868800,3,132,5.285714285714286
5969080,4,B00F76L0C4,"I saw this at a theater and I really enjoyed it -- immediately got into the plot because.  I actually knew a little about the plot beforehand and didn't think I'd get into it, and that was my early reservation.  But I found myself being very engaged by the acting, directing, script, production quality, etc.  Also, there was some good humor there in the dialog where most of the audience laughed.... it was enjoyable, and the whole court planning parts were cool.  Secondly, there was some moments there near the beginning during a sequence where it captured the play of light reflecting off cars and building and lens flares that I thought, wow, that was artful.  Overall, recommended!",1383868800,3,687,4.788135593220339
5969081,5,B00F76L0C4,I saw The Advocate at a film festival and loved it!  I can hardly wait until November 19th to buy the movie and watch it again!!!,1383782400,,129,3.9615384615384617
5969082,5,B00F76L0C4,Great movie!!!  Very well written.  The story is engaging from beginning to end.  It's not at all formulaic.  The acting is impeccable.  Highly recommended!!!,1383782400,2,158,5.416666666666667

not believeable
really silly in fact
90 minutes can be better spent",1393891200,,118,4.409090909090909
8612840,4,B00F76L0C4,"I went into this movie without many expectations but came out of it surprised by how compelling I found it. The pacing is definitely more deliberate and the amount of legal banter is probably more than one would expect but neither detracted from my enjoyment of the film. The story kept me engrossed and made up for some stilted acting at times. That being said, everyone did an admirable job considering the indie nature of the film.

If you're on the lookout for a more cerebral suspense, look no further.",1393286400,3,507,4.633333333333334
8612841,1,B00F76L0C4,"This was a terrible movie and I am alerting people NOT TO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE!  The acting was terrible, the characters delivered slow, badly said dialogue.  I think you have a foreigner here trying to deliver HOLLYWOOD STYLE drama, and he failed miserably at it.

The plot was slow, dry and not to be believed.  However, the package arrived in good order and I had no problems with timeliness of receiving the package, or anything.  Now, the movie, itself, was disappointing, as I said above.

DON'T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS DOLLARS ON IT!  I AM SELLING IT BACK TO AMAZON.COM, if I can!",1392422400,,582,4.647058823529412
8612842,5,B00F76L0C4,"This is an indie film with solid characters and a great script!  Great pick on Amazon. Waiting for the next ""Ray"" movie...",1390608000,2,122,4.545454545454546
8612843,5,B00F76L0C4,"This is a great movie that definitely keeps you engaged, entertained, and enthralled the entire time.  There are surprising twists that keep you guessing.  If you are thinking about watching this, I would not pass it up.",1390521600,4,220,4.918918918918919
8612844,4,B00F76L0C4,Interesting twist to the usual stories involving a defense attorney and a beautiful-but-probably-guilty defendant.  It was a nice diversion from our usual watching habits.,1388102400,3,171,6.125
8612845,5,B00F76L0C4,"Like Perry Mason, Ray Shekar (Sachin Mehta) has never lost a case. Unlike Perry Mason, Ray represents guilty people such as serial killers and pedophile rapists. Things change when Ray realizes serial killers will still kill after they are acquitted when his wife Susan is killed (Carolyn Stotesbery). At this point his clients disappear after they are acquitted. It isn't hard for us to figure this out, even the detective (Michael Raynor) who loathes Ray for defending these scum, is following him around waiting to bust him.

When the wife (Kristina Klebe) of a rich man is accused of killing her husband, Ray reluctantly takes the case which slowly weaves into complexity.

The early twists of the film were easy to figure out and in fact might discourage a seasoned viewer into thinking this is some made for TV hack Scooby-Doo script. That is not the case. The ending of film was very clever and it allows the viewer to ""see it coming"" as it unfolds. The only negative aspect of the film is that it makes you feel you are watching a low budget ""B"" film. The film is classified as a crime/mystery/thriller, although I was less interested in the mystery part than the nuts and bolts of how Perry, er ah Ray conducted the trial.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Implied sex. No nudity.",1386028800,4,1280,4.705357142857143
8612846,5,B00F76L0C4,"Let me just use some adjectives to describe this movie in brief: intense, captivating, well-written, sogood, edgeofyourseatthriller.

But seriously, entertaining movie with some great plot twists.  Really demands your attention because of how dense the storyline is, in a good way.  Would recommend!",1385510400,2,299,5.906976744186046
8612847,5,B00F76L0C4,"I've loved this genre since I was a little kid and the Advocate doesn't disappoint. First we have the moody music, which was nuanced without being cheesy. The editing was sharp. Then we have the Los Angeles locations, which is great given that most films are done in Canada with generic city settings trying to pass themselves off as Los Angeles. I find these films don't get the spirit of a city. There's thought and logic in the dialogue. I've seen the film twice with different sets of friends. After the second viewing I picked up more of the subtleties, which made it even richer. Is it a big budget film no. Does the Advocate tell a good story yes. Is it worth seeing? Most definitely. In this genre it's important not to pander to the audience. Good films make us think and don't provide summary dialogue or laugh tracks running throughout the film. They take us into their world for a few hours. And I enjoyed my time here.",1385337600,2,931,4.482352941176471
