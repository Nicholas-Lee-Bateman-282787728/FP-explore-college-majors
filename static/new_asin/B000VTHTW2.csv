8219902,5,B000VTHTW2,"""Pavarotti In Hyde Park"" is an awesome Concert. I had purchased the VHS version in the mid 90's loved it. Many years went by and I tried to obtain a DVD version without success. Then, about a month ago I found it here on Amazon.

If you don't have this DVD of the Hyde Park Concert, you're missing a great, great concert. The concert begins in early afternoon in a pouring rain in July 1991.  The opening scenes are of the crowd, along Prince Charles and Princess Diana arriving. The concert begins with thousands standing under an umbrella in the rain. The  Philharmonic Orchestra is outstanding. There is a solo flautist which is also great and the Philharmonic Chorus is awesome. Pavarotti sing his heart out to at least 4 encores [I may have miss counted].

The picture and sound quality is very good. The shots of the concert are wild. There are great camera angle shots--near, far, wide and overheads! Some very good close ups of individual musicians and shots that start out wide, and pan & zoom at the same time, which produces a great effect.

If you don't have this DVD, you've miss a great one!!",1385510400,,1106,4.5376884422110555
