I guess that says something right there.",1365552000,2,180,4.235294117647059
5401136,3,B00A8V5K1K,"Kind of a plodding/dawdling fictional ""crime"" movie about drug dealing in iceland.  It's definitely watchable it just doesn't go anywhere.  Is it worth watching?  The scenery is definitely different and it's shot pretty well; probably worth a rental if you watch these kinds of movies all the time.  I know the ""payoff"" in these movies is supposed to be when everything falls apart (the ""tragic"" fall) and the main character thinks about what he's done but in this movie this ""payoff"" isn't really handled well; it feels a bit hollow.  Also: there's very little violence in this movie which is odd for this type of movie.

3 stars; no more no less.  Meh is meh.",1360972800,2,661,4.695652173913044
5401137,5,B00A8V5K1K,"For such a small country Iceland doesn't half produce some talent and this is another example of what they can teach the rest of us. This is based on actual events and takes us back to the heady days of 1999, just before all the computers were going to fall over in 2000. It tells the story of Stebbi or `Psycho Stebbi' as he soon gets nicknamed (played by up and coming Thor Kristjansson `Reykjavik Whale Watching Massacre'). He gets into trouble with the law and at the police station he runs into an old chum in the shape of shaven headed Toti (played by the guy with a name that rolls of the tongue - Johannes Haukur Johanesson ). Well Toti says he has a lawyer that is so great he can get him off the rap. So when Stebbi calls he says he will put him in touch for a small favour, a bit of mutual back scratching as it were.

Once the nature of said favour is made clear Stebbi starts to get cold feet, but they soon warm up again. Only then Toti gives him some advice in `self help' in taking internal anger and externalising it. Sadly Stebbi takes this advice to heart and soon earns the nick name of Psycho.

It is not long before he is drawn into the world of underground drug dealing, sex and crime.... and violence. There is also a love interest in the very easy on the eye, Dragny (Maria Birta who was in the excellent `Jitters') who has a thing for Stebbi and likes putting stuff up her nose- charming.

This is a full on assault on the senses and whilst the violence is not gratuitous it is very up front and quite nasty at times, we also have a fair bit of `getting it on' and not always when one party is ready. Plenty of drug use and some very Anglo Saxon language, any humour is incidental.  That said, this had me hooked from the start and although it runs for 101 minutes it just seemed to speed past. I very much support the rise of Nordic films and think this can do nothing but enhance the already well established reputation that is well deserved - absolutely recommended.",1357344000,6,1995,4.228346456692913
5401138,3,B00A8V5K1K,"-- just seen it from an internet stream service...

... some twists are hard to believe, but overall it's an entertaining movie surely to keep you attentive and, in some parts, scared, specially on scenes where Bruno, the bad, bad guy, appears...
... the end is easily predictable but nonetheless enjoyable...

... the music soundtrack, is awesome!",1355011200,3,348,5.087719298245614
5401139,3,B00A8V5K1K,"Interesting plot. Good development of characters. Drugs, sex, and violence in Iceland of all places. It kept me engaged but the ending was bit short of how the rest of the movie went. So overall, a good watch. Enjoy.",1394236800,,216,4.564102564102564

5401142,5,B00A8V5K1K,"Drugs, Sex and Violence, all presented in a rather nuanced fashion.  At times I found myself making predictions about what was going to happen, only to find myself completely surprised by the directions the film took.

8548508,3,B00A8V5K1K,"Set in the late 1990s Reykjavik, an Icelandic crime drama Blacks Game (Svartur  leik) follows the story of Stebbi (Thor Kristjansson), a college student with legal trouble. Help arrives in the form of his childhood friend Tti (Jhannes Haukur Jhannesson), who asks Stebbi to find something for him. And Tti has been involved with underground business.

Executive-produced by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive Pusher), the film has no shoot-outs, explosions and car chases (ignore the DVD cover design), and that is not a bad thing. The problem of writer-director Oskar Thor Axelsson's debut feature is something else. The crime and drug scenes described here are realistic, I admit, but the film suffers from the lack of a driving narrative, or character development. In short, unlike in City of God, we are not really interested in the fate of the protagonist.

Perhaps the film could have used the unique Icelandic location more effectively, with more fleshed-out characters, especially the protagonists love interest Dagny (Maria B. Bjarnardottir). Visually stylish as it is, Blacks Game seems a missed opportunity.",1401148800,,1111,5.337142857142857
8548509,1,B00A8V5K1K,This garbage is indicative of all curent so called movies .. sex in the raw and not one good story line since 1999 .. Like the USA the screen writers guild is Bankrupt.,1401062400,,168,4.121212121212121
8548510,4,B00A8V5K1K,"Great fun if you like dark stories about criminals in unusual foreign (to us in the US) settings. Performed in native Icelandic tongue and sub-titled....and fast paced so you have to pay attention. Not for the soft hearted or easily shocked or offended. Lot's of violence, sex, drugs and even some rock-and-roll. :)  A lot of the action takes place in Reykjavk, but other Icelandic cities are included in the plot. Action filled and suspenseful, with some truly evil dudes.....Not an epic production, but an excellent choice for anyone who wants to enjoy a good yarn about bad people doing bad things in a strange place.",1400544000,2,620,4.849056603773585
8548511,1,B00A8V5K1K,"I couldn't finish this movie. It's the old stupid rookie story, where the protagonist is mistaken for being way more competent then he truly is. The protagonist plays along until he's in water too deep. I held on hoping it had a nice twist, that would reveal the rookie to be playing a deeper game. I had to give it up after 3/4 of the movie! Yeah, he is as dumb as he seems!",1399075200,,375,4.081081081081081
8548512,5,B00A8V5K1K,"Nothing at all.  Whatsoever.  Absolutely and totally zero.

Frak all lying, sleazoid distribution companies.  All they do with bait & switch tactics is to frustrate viewers, who are expecting one thing, then get another.

What this film is NOT:  An American action shoot-em-up.  Even the description in English ""to pay off a debt, a college student, blah, blah . . . "" is only vaguely related to the plot.  I'm not certain whoever wrote the description actually saw the film.

This film is:  About dealing drugs in Iceland, from 1999-2000.  It's a decent suspense film, and the cinematography, plot, characters, dialogue. artistic technique, etc. are all awesome, and a great example of what Hollywood has largely shown itself completely incapable of doing: writing a movie.  There's lots of sex and violence, very little of which has to do with sidearms.  One can do a tremendous amount of violence without a firearm, folks.

The film is similar to Trainspotting in many ways.

The ending is awful, and I'm pretty sure was forced upon the producers for the subtitled version for the American market or for European distribution.  Awful, awful ending that has very little to do with the rest of the film.  Came close to giving it one star because of the ending, but . . . just ignore the ending, blame it on the editors, and take the film up until that point.

A lot of people will really, really hate this movie.  Seems to be 100 people hating it to 1 person liking it.  Not a surprise.

Icelandic women are clearly the most beautiful in the world, btw.  I'm debating moving to Iceland.",1396483200,,1587,4.7153284671532845
8548513,3,B00A8V5K1K,"So this isn't a ""shootem up movie."" Has an American style culture which I hated. Stop with these predictable endings. The cover, title, (who-in-the-heck is Black?) and movie info cannot be trusted when watching this movie. The old bait & switch. Otherwise, a very watchable movie.",1395705600,,280,5.108695652173913
8548514,3,B00A8V5K1K,It was a very violent  movie. He climbed up the drug ladder and acheived his dream-loads of money. You could call this drug multi-marketing. I gave it a 3 because of the super graphic cussing and violence.,1394409600,,205,4.54054054054054
