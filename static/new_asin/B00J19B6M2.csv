8647247,5,B00J19B6M2,"I have a couple live2hunt productions now and this is probably the best.  Less talk and silliness than others and all the scenery, adventure and quality I hoped for.  Well filmed harvest shots on animals I only dream on hunting.  Lots of work to pack cameras up snow covered mtns, only to fail and have to do it again-strong work to Cody and co. Also grateful they shared their observation at the end of the Alberta bighorn adventure-I love those kind of little treasures!",1426809600,,472,4.595238095238095
