1995577,4,B0001F7UW0,Although the DVD was received in good time and in excellent condition its worth mentioning to overseas buyers to always check the region code of the DVD's you purchase. A DVD coded for the US market or for European will not automatically play on a DVD player which coded for Australasia. Many DVD players can be code broken but its not a certainty. My old DVD player had been decoded to accept all regions but a few months ago I purchased a new player and then had to go through the exercise of surfing the web in order to find out if it was possible on the new Phillips 3D DVD player. Good news for this purchase was that I could decode for standard DVD's but it's not possible for Blue Ray or 3D discs.,1351728000,,704,4.222222222222222
1995578,5,B0001F7UW0,Great movie and not very well known. This movie was recommended to me by a friend in Hong Kong. I had never heard of it but was impressed by the production quality and soundtrack. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a unique and fun European film.,1329609600,2,262,4.36734693877551
1995579,4,B0001F7UW0,"What can you say.  This is a rather trashy full length music video about English drug gangsters with very rough edges (even the director's commentary sounds like a bunch of low lifes).  There are some amateurish moments, including a weird scene where I think one of the camera vehicles gets in the picture, but its all in fun.  If you enjoyed the subtlety of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, this is somewhat similar.",1299369600,2,419,4.635135135135135
1995580,4,B0001F7UW0,"Once again Nick Love hires on one of his favorite actors, Danny Dyer, to boost this old war horse of an idea. Some might say this is ""Scarface"" meets ""Blow"" and they'd be right on. Here, Dyer plays a guy who isn't bad, but is kind of lost. After beating his stepfather (for beating his mother) he's forced to head to Spain where he hooks up with a popular club owner. Said club owner takes Dyer under his wing and the two, with the help of a few others, rise in the marijuana business. As Mary Jane turns to cocaine they rise and rise and rise. But the business is too big for them and the fall comes hard.

This is set in the 80s with good attention payed to cars, fashions and music. The soundtrack here is outstanding. As I said, there is nothing new here as far as the basic outline of the story is concerned. What makes it work are the characters and performances. The Sammy character is particularly good. He's like a bomb that could go off at any time. Every time he's on screen you're worried something really ugly is going to happen. He's a scary, scary dude. Some characters are fleshed out better than others but as an ensemble they do a nice job.

The other thing going here is the script. As over used as the idea is this is still written very well. The writers take you up and down the drug trade ladder in fine fashion. I didn't feel forced through either the situations or the running time. Things moved at the right pace.

If you're at all a fan of the genre this is a good outing. All the production values are good. It moves well and has a good feel to it. The accents do get a bit thick at times and you'll probably miss some of the dialogue, but it's a worth it.",1291248000,6,1683,4.172307692307692
1995581,5,B0001F7UW0,"Although not a fan of gangster movies, I love English and Irish films. I first saw Danny Dyer in ""Severance"" and then without realizing it recognized him in ""The Football Factory"". As I looked to see what other movies he was in, one of them was ""The Business"". I didn't think I'd like it because it was described as a gangster film but I loved it. Just because the guy he is supposed to meet is called 'the playboy' in the very beginning doesn't mean anything. He's never called the playboy any other time throughout the movie. It is such an upbeat movie-the music alone makes it entertaining to watch. I thought it was very different than an American gangster movie. Danny's character, Frankie and the supposed gangster, Charlie, become real friends, not just gangsters shooting everyone and trying to make money. I thought it was a great movie! I've come to buy all of Danny Dyer's films but this one, I can watch over and over again and I still love it!",1281225600,4,956,4.531791907514451
1995582,4,B0001F7UW0,"Frankie is a young man who mother is verbally and physically abused by her husband/Frankie's father.  When abuse turns to be too much, Frankie whacks his father that forces him to find unconventional ""job"" carrying delivery packages between London and Malaga.  In Malaga, beautiful city right off the Spanish coast, Frankie becomes fast friend with the local gangster with strong connections to the organization.  It does not take long before Frankie becomes gangster's best buddy and a driver.  As time progresses they form a group of guys smuggling marijuana from Africa to Gibraltar that brings them fortunes, women and kind of life one can only dream of.

Life is good until jealousy and greed start to mix.  Old and new freindships to do not mash well and before long, Frankie an his friends have to start over and rethink their business plan.  This time around they get into a cocaine business.  And before long their luck seems to get out of their reach.

Great movie with lots of action and dark comedy.  If you ever saw ""Sexy Beast"" this movie is made in similar art form.  Even the gangsters have to keep reinventing themselves and this movie will show you how.",1239840000,,1171,4.776119402985074
1995583,3,B0001F7UW0,"Well, if you don't know about Zalman King then you will after this movie.  Zalman King creates movies where there is always a sex scene or two or three of them.  In this movie you see a relationship grow between two ""business partners"" that has a tragic ending.  This movie is truly a Zalman King original.",1224892800,,306,4.428571428571429

8011636,5,B0001F7UW0,"As a Zalman King fan from way back, I enjoy all of his films. This is not a review of the film but I simply wanted to state that there are a lot of new copies of this still floating around for not much money and it will upscale nicely if transferred from VHS to DVD-R on a home unit first and then viewed through a blu-ray player with an HDTV set to 4:3 resolution. It actually looks almost as good as an average quality 2000-2005-ish era DVD which really surprised me, considering that VHS resolution is 280 and DVD is 480. Hope this helps you with your decision.",1470614400,2,564,4.18348623853211
8011637,5,B0001F7UW0,"Vaguely remember this movie from the 1990s. Interesting story.  Since it is VHS, didn't expect a spotless picture. The story-line is still intriguing and enjoyable.",1457481600,,164,5.56
8011638,5,B0001F7UW0,"This is truly a beautiful movie.  It has received a lot of negative criticism, because people are afraid of the highly elite sexual nature of this production.  For sure the majority of the world can not indulge their voyeuristic fantasies in the way the the character of Jerone Krabb is able to, but if you could, would you?  And, clearly there are people who do have such an exotic lifestyle and people are shocked when it gets into the news.  Sex is a powerful force in the world and should be celebrated.  It is a sad commenttary that people flock to view blood and guts and killing for hours, yet the pleasure of sex is so shamed.  No one is murdered in this film (although someone does die at the end).  The performance by Jerone Krabb is extraordinary, a truly suave performance.  The scenery (filmed in Austria) is truly inspirational.  The theme music (composed by George S. Clinton-who also did Mortal Kombat) is exquisite.  This is one of the most brilliant and deep movies I have ever seen; it is deep in that it causes people, who are able to go deep, to consider their inner most desires and how honest they can be with themselves.  I wish this film would come out on DVD.",1425168000,,1185,4.465116279069767
8011639,1,B0001F7UW0,"I'd give zero Stars if possible. These blue Ray movies Will not play on blue ray players in the united states,I imagine it's because they are from the uk and probably only play on their players. I tried a regular blue Ray player next ps3 and last c box one. I though it might have been the disk but I  purchased  another movie from them same distributor and it was the same thing. I'm very disappointed and I should have known better than to buy things from overseas and these were awesome movies...",1416096000,,499,4.354838709677419

8011641,3,B0001F7UW0,"This is a quite watchable British gangster movie, but it's definitely not as good as ""Sexy Beast"" or even ""Layer Cake"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This is the story of a young wanna bee gangster named Frankie (Danny Dyer), who has to flee England and goes to Spain, where he joins four real, hardened gangster old timers: handsome ""Playboy Charlie"" (Tamer Hassan), psychopatic Sammy (Geoff Bell) as well as two less important characters, Ronnie and Danny. Those men, known also as the ""Peckham Four"", are wanted in United Kingdom and therefore took refuge in Spain and live mostly from marijuana traffic. With time Frankie becomes a full time member of the gang, which in the meantime switched to the more lucrative cocaine business... He also attracts attention of Sammy's beautiful wife Carly (Georgina Chapman), which makes his life much more interesting - but also threatens his very survival...

This is a quite classical gangster movie, about the rise and fall of a bunch of rather unsavory characters, of which the vilest and the most dangerous is certainly Sammy, a complete psychopath who is quite a fascinating person to watch, as long as he stays safely on the other side of the screen... As promised on the cover the language is particularly strong, even for a gangster movie - on another hand if you expect shootouts like in ""Scarface"" or ""Heat"", well, you will be very disappointed...

It is not a bad film, to the contrary, I rather liked it, but other than a couple of real gags and some absolutely surrealistic and irresistible conversations it is nothing special. However the MUSIC in this film is absolutely PHENOMENAL - it is one of the best nostalgia trips into 80s I ever heard on the screen. Just to name some of the artists whose music we can enjoy here - Duran Duran, Blondie, Simple Minds, David Bowie, Talk Talk and of course Frankie Goes to Hollywood...

Bottom line, this is a very honest watch albeit not really something extraordinary. I will keep my DVD and maybe one day I will see it again. Enjoy!",1390435200,2,2064,4.773109243697479
8011642,5,B0001F7UW0,"BUSINESS FOR PLEASURE  (1997)  91 minutes

  Typical Zalman King effort, every scene is like a beautiful painting has come to life. This one is supposed to be upscale soft core, and it is. You cannot watch this one without a bottle of wine and some cheese and crackers. The women are gorgeous including the likes of Caron Bernstein (done some Red Shoes Diary installments) and Joanna Pacula, while the men are really handsome, including the likes of Jeroen Krabb and Gary Stretch (in real life a professional prize fighter who dated Raquel Welch  even though she was 25 years his senior). Gary has looks that are guaranteed to make the ladies in the audience swoon. Although there is ample nudity and a lot of sexual situations,  the nudity is never blatant and the sex is never explicit. Everything the viewer sees is only hinted at so they have to use their imagination watching this one, which is actually the strength of the movie and why it works so well. Every shot is captured with inspiration, whether its a landscape, a horse gamboling in a meadow, or two naked bodies in passionate embrace. Of course, this is a Zalman  King flick, so you know he is going to focus on the beauty that is woman. This movie is about beautiful people make that beautiful, people who happen to be filthy rich   and it has  an exotic setting (Vienna, Austria) where the protagonists of the drama bide their time by fulfilling their erotic fantasies. This is highbrow soft core, for sure,  accompanied by an exquisite soundtrack to boot, you, know, the kind that finds its way to CD. Leave this VHS tape out on your coffee table and you will not be embarrassed if a visitor sees it and asks you about it.",1381363200,2,1691,4.5813953488372094
