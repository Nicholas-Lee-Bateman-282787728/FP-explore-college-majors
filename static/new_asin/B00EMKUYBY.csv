Disc 4: Under a violet Moon - castle tour 2000-. I love blackmores night the first two albums are great to listen too. I love the two concert DVDs, sound quality is decent and Video image is decent. I love watching the early concert footage of them performing. If your a fan of blackmores night I would recommend this box set.",1461369600,,500,4.21875
8606852,5,B00EMKUYBY,"The reason for buying this collection is for the two audio CD's. They are copies of Blackmore's Night's first 2 albums (Shadow of the Moon and Under a Violet Moon). The CD's have been remastered and sound great. Additionally, all four discs in this package come in a deluxe case. Although the sound quality on the two video discs is not the best, this is a very affordable way to purchase Blackmore's Night first two albums if purchased through the third party sellers. These albums are very expensive if bought individually.",1429401600,,525,4.78021978021978
