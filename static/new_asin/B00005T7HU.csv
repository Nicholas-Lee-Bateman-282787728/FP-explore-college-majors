7953710,5,B00005T7HU,"Star Blazers:  The Comet Empire Part I, contains episodes 1-5 (out of 26) of the second season of the cult-favorite Americanized Japanese Anime series from the early 1980s.
In addition, the DVD also contains complete characters bios and setting information.
The Comet Empire Saga picks up where the Quest for Iscandar leaves off.  Two years has passed since the Starforce returned from Iscandar with the Cosmo DNA restoring earth to all its glory following the waves Gamilon planet bombing.  Mankind was risen out of the ashes and restored itself again to a thriving civilization.  With everything seemingly returned to normal the stage is set again for the fate of mankind to take another dramatic turn for the worse as an even bigger and more treacherous foe looms in the darkness of space, threatening to destroy mankind once and for all...
Here is a summary of the five episodes included on this DVD:
Episode 1:  Introducing - The Comet Empire!!!  A threat from the past and a new threat are joining forces to take on mankind.  While on a patrol mission in space the Argo is attacked by two unknown, highly advanced fighters.
Episode 2:  Argo returns to Earth from patrol.  Derek takes leave with Nova touring the now restored Earth and it's megalopolis capital.  The former Starforce has a grand reunion at the Capt. Avatar Memorial.  Sandor and Wildstar take a tour of the Andromeda, the highly computerized flagship of the new Earth Defense Forces.  Plus, all the signs are beginning:  a mysterious comet is hurtling toward earth, mysterious energy blackouts are occurring and a mysterious plea for help from outer space is received...
Episode 3:  Deep in space Desslok and the remnants of the Gamilons muster together for ultimate revenge.  After pleading in vain with the Earth Defense Council to launch a mission to investigate the unknown threat, Wildstar makes a fateful decision that may cost him and his comrades dearly...
Episode 4:  Against all orders of the Earth Defense Council the Starforce reunites under Wildstar to take action and investigate this new threat.
Episode 5:  The Earth Defense Council sends the mighty Andromeda and Capt. Gideon to bring back the renegade Starforce.  Plus, Conroy, Hardy and other pilots from the Moon Base (re)join the Starforce!!!
In addition to the above great episodes, the DVD also contains the following exclusive special features:
1. Character bios of the Starforce members featured in the Comet Empire saga.
2. A gallery of Earth (and it's territories) with background information in the year 2201 A.D.
3. A shameless plug for Part II
The character bios and ""Earth Gallery"" contains great background information into the plot and storyline for the Comet Empire Saga.  Overall, it's a great bonus.
Overall, the Comet Empire saga, in my opinion, is definitely the best story arc out of all three Star Blazers sagas.  The Comet Empire was ten times the foe the Gamilons were and the action within the story arc is much more intense - and it all starts here.
Summed up, if you were ever a Star Blazers fan, give this (and all past and future volumes) a watch.  It's great for a trip down memory lane.  If you've NEVER seen Star Blazers, give it a try.  It's a cult classic from the 80's (along with other Americanized anime greats like Robotech, Voltron, Transor Z, etc).  The animation may look slightly dated, but the storyline still holds its own very well against anything out there today.  Due to limited distribution this show may have slipped by the radar of a lot of people but it caught on like a fire with those who did catch it.  Give it a watch and see what all the rage was about.
