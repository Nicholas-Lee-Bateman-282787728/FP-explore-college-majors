8077223,5,B000AAPXNE,I saw this movie as a teenager in high school.  I loved it then.  I'm hoping to love it as well as an adult.  I think my husband purchased the video for me for Christmas so I haven't seen it yet.,1482105600,,195,3.707317073170732

This also needed some special installation on my PC to be able to view.  Was worth it.  You  can also read the book which is quite good..",1403049600,,263,4.098039215686274

8077228,4,B000AAPXNE,"After spending the better part of the 1950's as MGM's resident French gamine, Leslie Caron finally turned in her toe shoes and delivered a poignant performance in this black-and-white 1962 British ""kitchen sink"" drama directed and written by Bryan Forbes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stepford-Wives/dp/B00026L8US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stepford Wives</a>, the original 1975 version). She plays Jane Fosset, a 27-year-old Frenchwoman who finds herself in a standard predicament - she thinks she may be pregnant after a brief, loveless affair. After visiting with an insolent doctor who presumes the worst about her, Jane decides to keep the baby and move into the eponymous studio up in the attic of a rundown boarding house in the then-seedy Fulham area of London. Initially withdrawn from her fellow residents, all social outsiders in their own way, Jane finds herself bonding with everyone, especially Toby, the tortured writer who lives in the unit below. They naturally fall in love, but once he finds out about her pregnancy, he struggles with it and becomes overwhelmed by his own failures.

Forbes keeps the story going at a pace that sometimes feels glacial as the film runs an overlong 126 minutes, but Caron imbues so much compassion into her role that it makes it all worthwhile. The supporting cast is fine as well with Tom Bell quite good as Toby. Bearing a striking resemblance to Laurence Harvey, Bell had his only ""leading man"" role in this film and later became a busy character actor facing off with Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prime-Suspect/dp/B0028AEO0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prime Suspect</a>. Fresh off his 180-degree turn as the wrongfully accused rapist in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Kill-a-Mockingbird/dp/B000ID37RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>, Brock Peters provides an ebullient presence as Johnny, a West Indian jazz musician who lives next door to Jane. His character is rather intriguing because you can't quite tell whether Johnny's jealousy of Jane and Toby's burgeoning romance is spurred on by his attraction toward one or the other. Cicely Courtneidge makes an impression as a former vaudevillian who has become a lonely woman obsessed with her cat. Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor, Op. 15, is used effectively as background music on the soundtrack. You should read Caron's fond recollection of the film's production in her affecting autobiography,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thank-Heaven-A-Memoir/dp/B005HKTPHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thank Heaven: A Memoir</a>.",1331596800,4,2771,6.311345646437995
8077229,5,B000AAPXNE,"This film used to be on tv a lot when I was younger. I watched it every time and wish I could afford it on DVD! It is similar to Rear Window or Stage Door in the sense that it is about an apartment full of characters who have nothing in common and find acceptance and true friendship by being in the same place. This film shows lesbians in a relationship when most movies wouldn't even mention lesbians and if they did someone would have to die! It shows a pregnant girl who is loved and accepted, not judged in a time when pregnancy was not discussed or in movies. If you were an unmarried pregnant girl you had to feel guilty or die! Or at the very least suffer and feel great guilt. But Jane is proud and self confident. She does not bow down and accept the ""rules"" of her time. And I love this about her character! I wish it was still on tv as I really love this film!! It is a rare film where I hate it to end because I am having so much fun with the characters but this is one of those rare times!",1285286400,6,1003,3.9702970297029703
8077230,5,B000AAPXNE,"Optimum Films has given us the great gift of a beautiful, widescreen transfer of this outstanding film.  The photography is stunning, the acting first-rate, and the story compelling.  Peter Katin's soulful rendition of Brahm's Piano Concerto in D Minor accompanies, and complements, the touching story throughout.

Leslie Caron is perfect as 27-year-old Jane, a young French woman who finds lodgings in a seedy London rooming house.  Next door to her L-shaped attic room is Johnny, a West Indian jazz musician.  Downstairs is Toby (Tom Bell in his most memorable role), an aspiring writer.  Avis Bunnage is the feisty Cockney landlady and Cicely Courtneidge is an over-the-hill music hall performer.  A veritable treasure-trove of  delightful English character actors populate their dysfunctional familial world.

The story centers around the shaky romance of Jane and Toby.  She is remarkably independent for a woman of that era (1962 was just the dawning of women's rights).  Tom Bell is achingly handsome, and utterly winning in his low-key, self-effacing, but determined pursuit of his neighbor.  He wins her over, but then takes off when informed that Jane is pregnant by another man.  If there is a false note in the film, it is Johnny's curious `morality' (especially for a jazz musician), and his spitefulness in telling Toby of the baby.  But he too is in love with Toby.

We want so much for the beautiful couple to be together, the non-committal ending comes as something of a relief.  At least we can hope for their future happiness.",1209513600,18,1545,5.095617529880478
8077231,5,B000AAPXNE,"I came across this film on accident and was really amazed that it is largely unknown or untalked about.  Here is what the case said about it:

""Young, unmarried and pregnant, a French beauty named Jane Fosset moves into a seedy London boarding house. Everyone living there has been rejected by society - blacks, homosexuals, prostitues, bohemians.  Jane falls for one such outcast, a struggling writer, and their love affair has everyone talking - including those who know her dark secret.  Caron earned an Oscar nomination for her marvelous performance as Jane.""

This is a good, interesting story about strangers interacting and affecting each other and their decisions.  It might sound like a soap opera, but it was so much better than anything like that.

I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys moody period movies.",1198886400,12,823,5.007352941176471
