2731996,5,B000MGBSHG,This is one of the best shows on TV! The characters are likeable and the storylines are interesting. I hope it stays around for a very long time!,1183507200,,145,4.214285714285714
8168747,5,B000MGBSHG,"Tony, Gibbs, Ducky, Abby, Kate and eventually Ziva will keep you laughing and keep your brain from atrophying. This is a smart, funny show that makes you think at times. The main characters investigate crimes that involve Navy or Marine personnel. You can't help but fall in love with the characters from the very first episode. I have watched these over and over again and still find something new each time. If you like a program that doesn't insult your intelligence, will make you laugh, and will make you root for the main characters, you must buy this NCIS set.",1331596800,,567,4.68
8168748,5,B000MGBSHG,"Most spin offs do not take off as well as NCIS has and it is a huge success in its own right.  Mark Harmon is real, natural, and a great leader with wonderful co-workers as Michael Weatherly, David McCallum, and Abby, Zavi, McGee, and all of the other support cast.  NCIS is a MUST OWN series.",1252540800,,293,4.214285714285714
8168749,5,B000MGBSHG,I am very pleased with my purchase.  It was easy to order and the product came as promised.  I will certainly use Amazon again for future orders.,1239408000,,145,4.333333333333333
8168750,4,B000MGBSHG,I love the show but started watching it on CBS during season four. This gives me a chance to watch the development of the show from the begining. Only negative is that disk 2 of season one is damaged and won't play.,1229385600,,215,4.142857142857143
8168751,5,B000MGBSHG,"My family and friends love this show because it takes the overplayed crime drama, adds in some humor, and places it in a military context (though, sadly, they chose to deemphasize the military side of it, opting to rarely base episodes on naval sites like ships after the first season). The characters are well-developed, and I enjoy watching them over and over again even though I already know whodunnit since the dialogue and writing is so marvelous!

When buying this from Amazon, compare the prices between the different NCIS products. Some days it's cheaper to buy them as one set, sometimes it's cheaper to buy a partial set and a season or two individually (which is what I found when I ordered this; it was cheaper to buy 1-3 as a set and then 4 on its own than it would have been to buy all the seasons individually or to buy the 1-4 set), and sometimes it's cheaper to just buy them all as individual seasons ... so compare before you order!",1229212800,,951,4.497109826589595
8168752,5,B000MGBSHG,I really enjoy this show. The end up this season was disapointing. I like Mark Harmon.,1221091200,,86,4.4375
8168753,5,B000MGBSHG,"I love the NCIS series. I had not seen the earlier seasons before. Watching them just reinforced my feelings about the series. The characters are intelligent and funny, as well. The plots are believable. The acting is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed them.",1205798400,,255,5.095238095238095
8168754,5,B000MGBSHG,"This order was perfect.  However, my previous order of 6 seasons of Judging Amy was terrible.  Some discs are out of order (like disc 5 showed things that happened after disc 6)  Some shows are duplicated.
The worst part is that it freezes up in the middle of a program and nothing else can be seen on that disc. Plus you have TNT commercials during the programs, not separate but over the scene. I would suggest that you discontinue selling for the company that made this.",1197936000,,473,4.476744186046512
8168755,5,B000MGBSHG,"It's interesting to watch the progression as the characters develope, learn and grow as a team and individuals.  Over time, they not only get used to the little quirks & eccentricites of each other, but adapt some of the same to suit & evolve their own personalities, yet still maintain their unique identities.  You see how they deal with the death of a central character as well as dredging up old ghosts.  Various displays of strengths & weaknesses only add to the appeal of the show as they seem both larger than life and all too human.  An excellent show.  I hope it has a very long run.",1190160000,,592,4.444444444444445
8168756,5,B000MGBSHG,"A brilliant box set, right from the first episode to the last. Excellent value, neat presentation and a great keep-sake.",1185580800,2,120,5.05
