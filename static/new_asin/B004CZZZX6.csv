4331068,5,B004CZZZX6,"This is my favorite Hart to Hart movie. I love old fashioned seaside setting of Kingman's Cove with its Victorian hotel, bandstand, and sweeping vistas of the sea. The cast of characters are interesting as always.  Love Rodney McDowell.  Just love this mixture of romance, mystery, and adventure!",1357948800,3,296,5.145833333333333
4331069,3,B004CZZZX6,"I chose the dvd because I enjoyed the Hart to Hart series - I realise that the actors were older but
it lacked the 'charisma' shall we say of the original series",1354147200,,161,4.0625
4331070,5,B004CZZZX6,"As expected from the Hart to Hart Tv Show, Stephanie Powers and Robert Wagner still have great chemistry and it's apparent in this movie.  It's the typical type of Hart to Hart show just made into a longer version.  It's fun, entertaining and mindless.  I love watching Stephanie and Robert together.  Clean fun and good tv.  I'd recommend it to all.",1326412800,10,350,4.672131147540983

4331072,3,B004CZZZX6,"Loved the original series, and enjoyed the first movie (Hart to Hart returns) more than this one. Plenty of innuendo, Max and Freeway Jnr but the plot is a bit poor despite a cast including Roddy Mc Dowell and Howard Keel.",1320192000,2,222,4.439024390243903

4331074,5,B004CZZZX6,"I have seen the movie on television and knew I'd enjoy it, However the product is defective.  I tried to return it for an exchange, but the post office won't send it back because it has been opened.  I would like to exchange.  Explain what I need to do.  The package is in good condition to mail back, it is just taped instead of glued shut.???????",1315267200,2,348,4.2272727272727275
