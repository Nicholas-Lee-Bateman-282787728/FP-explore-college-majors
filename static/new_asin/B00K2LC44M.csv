2. Couldn't understand w/o any subtitles.  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. Waste of money spent, and you cannot get your money back.",1406505600,,256,3.8653846153846154

6401486,2,B00K2LC44M,"I am wondering if I received a bootleg copy, the English translation was not good quality, the DVD options for translations were English and no subtitles, when selecting English subtitles, there was no subtitle, when selecting no subtitles, then it worked. Also the quality of the picture is not the best. After purchasing on Amazon, I conducted further research and found out that the movie is due for release in the US in September 2014.",1402790400,15,439,4.866666666666666

8655339,3,B00K2LC44M,"I'm a huge fan of both these wuxia stars, and leapt at the chance to see them together. The opening ten minutes which set the stage for the conflict between opposing forces of ""good"" and ""evil"" was absolutely fabulous, and the DVD is worth keeping just for that! But the story of the Monkey King, which I have seen in various printed, animated, and live action versions, falters along the way. Donnie Yen is a fabulous martial artist and has fun being a monkey; he definitely has monkey physicality down. But he spends too much screen time hamming it up with clownlike expressions. I take my kung fu movies and my Monkey Kings a little more seriously. Five stars for the opening confrontation and for the occasional action. One star for the rest... a meandering fairy tale. Averages out to 3 stars.",1474934400,,798,4.626760563380282
