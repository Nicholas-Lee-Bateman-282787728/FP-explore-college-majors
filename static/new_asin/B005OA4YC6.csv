4851569,5,B005OA4YC6,My son have other Mighty Machines video and this one have parts of them. But he love it. He says that he like it.,1364688000,,113,3.75
4851570,5,B005OA4YC6,"I love this series. My grandson is a truck enthusiast and all of these dvds do a great job of showing the trucks and explaining what they do and how they do it. They are easy to understand and really give the kids an understanding of the truck. They all feature full color videos of the trucks in action. No cartoons. They talk as if you came to visit them on the job site and they are showing you what they can do. The dialog is something like this ""Hi Kids. My name is Forks. They call me that because I have these 2 big forks on the front of my truck. I use them to pick up these scrap cars. A fork truck like me is very handy in a junk yard."" Meanwhile they will show the fork truck picking up the scrap cars in the junkyard. Adults can learn a few things too. I would highly recommend ANY of the Mighty Machine DVDs.",1364342400,,821,3.981818181818182
4851571,1,B005OA4YC6,"Bought this thinking it was a new mighty machine, but it's just little pieces selected from all the other ones.  My son was very disappointed.",1335139200,2,142,4.68
4851572,5,B005OA4YC6,"They are glued to the TV. SO, I am not sure which likes the DVD better Papa or the grandsons?  They explain what each piece of equipment does and the reason why.  Just an excellent DVD!!",1335139200,,186,4.138888888888889
4851573,1,B005OA4YC6,"I also pre ordered this video as it was described to be a brand new one, I don't know who was more mad when it arrived, me or my son
If you own all of these dvd's DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS",1330473600,3,193,3.511627906976744
4851574,1,B005OA4YC6,"Like many parents of toddlers and preschoolers, I have found the Mighty Machine video's among the best available. They are entertaining and well-made, and parents can learn quite a bit as well. When I saw there was a new one, I quickly pre-ordered it from Amazon. When it arrived, we excitedly opened it and our 3 year-old son was excited. We told him a ""new Mighty machines"" had arrived. Unfortunately, there is nothing new about his video. It shows short clips from old episodes, and while they are well made, there is nothing new here. He quickly noticed as well, as we all felt like we had been duped. If you want to watch the real Mighty Machine's order the old ones. If you want to waste your money on something ""new"", then this is for you.",1330041600,19,746,4.452554744525547
4851575,1,B005OA4YC6,"I assumed like the last reviewer that this was indeed a new Mighty Machine. But it is 13 mini shows of all there other DVD's, basically clips of the other shows. Buy the other full episodes this one is a waste. The kids were VERY disappointed and so am I. Going to see if I can return it.",1329782400,14,288,3.9827586206896552
4851576,1,B005OA4YC6,"When I saw the title, ""Smash, Mash, and Crash"" with an image of a garbage truck I assumed it was a new garbage truck themed Mighty Machines (there was no description stating otherwise- maybe Amazon will update that soon). However, this is NOT a new Mighty Machines. It's just 13 ""mini smashing and crashing episodes."" In other words, you get thirteen 5-minute clips of the most exciting footage from previous Mighty Machine episodes.

Stories include:
-Picking up the trash
-At the cement yard
-After the blast

I pre-ordered this for my son who is obsessed with garbage trucks. Had the description stated that it was 13 mini-episodes from previously released DVDs, I would not have purchased it as we already own every Mighty Machines.

My son loves Mighty Machines, but ""Smash, Mash, and Crash"" was a huge disappointment.",1329523200,38,823,4.949275362318841
4851577,3,B005OA4YC6,Video is OK...... cover is misleading as there is hardly any garbage truck action in the video (which is my son's favorite). My son was not overly impressed with the video.,1415145600,2,172,4.580645161290323

4851582,5,B005OA4YC6,My son is 4 and is in love with any kind of truck. This movie is wonderful for him. He has actually learned every different kind of truck from this video by their proper name! Great purchase!!,1392422400,,192,4.216216216216216

4851586,5,B005OA4YC6,"I bought this video for my 5 yr old granson because he is facinated with garbage trucks, or any truck of any kind.  He has watched this video over and over - and, my son enjoys watching it with him.  The first time I put it in at my house, they both sat there staring at the TV - this is definitely a best buy for boys",1366329600,,318,3.7313432835820897

8481014,4,B005OA4YC6,"My son loves these movies and was so happy to see they made one about garbage trucks. Wish they had more garbage trucks in the video, they show a lot of other kinds of vehicles but still a good little video.",1434931200,,207,4.073170731707317
8481015,5,B005OA4YC6,"The intro is annoying but catchy. Sometimes I get up in the middle of the night and the tune starts in my head. It's so 90's, boring and the dialogs are lame. That being said my toddlers love it. They love seeing big trucks and know the parts and what they do. I have tried to make them watch Dora the Explorer and many other kids show and they always go ""machines, machines"" in that high pitched sweet 2 year old voice. I would give it 1 star but I'm writing this review on behalf of my kiddos. They don't watch a lot of tv but when they do, this is the show they want.",1429228800,,570,3.965217391304348

8481018,3,B005OA4YC6,"I love the mighty machines series, but my grandson wanted to see garbage trucks.  He is two and loves them, but this video only has one small two minute  segment on the DVD.  He will eventually want to watch them all, but for now it was very disappointing only to have a small segment for garbage trucks when the DVD cover shows a garbage truck, very deceiving.",1428537600,,361,4.358208955223881
8481019,5,B005OA4YC6,"My son Loves mighty machines so for Christmas I expanded his collection, he usually picks 1 or 2 episodes per DVD that he will watch over and over but eventually gets into the whole DVD. I highly recommend all mighty machine DVDs for toddlers curious about the working world around them.",1419984000,,287,4.647058823529412
