7751758,5,B01FRQCC1G,"Some of the existing reviews express disappointment, and claim quality has fallen off earlier episodes. I don't agree. These are just as good, and I even like the young star. The young Livia, also the subject of some complaints, I find less flashy and more real somehow.",1476662400,2,270,4.76595744680851
7751759,4,B01FRQCC1G,This continues to be an excellent series. Highly interesting stories and first rate acting.,1475280000,,91,5.571428571428571
7751760,5,B01FRQCC1G,I found this to be another great Montalbano  set of dvd`s,1474934400,,57,4.181818181818182
7751761,5,B01FRQCC1G,"Husband and I both love this series, the old Montalbano and now this one, The Young Montalbano.  It is an interesting way for me to keep up with learning Italian but, it also is an interesting fun series.  Husband speaks Italian but no longer hears it except for our DVDs.  His Mom passed on last year and was the last to speak it fluently.  I have bought many an Italian series and Montalbano, both the old and the new series is our favorite.  We are definitely addicted.",1473897600,2,472,4.379310344827586
7751762,5,B01FRQCC1G,A great addition to the Young Montalbano series.,1473292800,,48,5.125
7751763,5,B01FRQCC1G,Absolutely love these series! Michele Riondino is GREAT!,1472688000,,56,6.125
7751764,5,B01FRQCC1G,"Excellent!! A highly entertaining plot, great actors and well worth the wait, hope there will be more plots to come!",1470528000,2,116,4.85
7751765,5,B01FRQCC1G,"This with episodes 7-9 is my favorite Montalbano of all . . .young and old.  In each episode, three and sometimes four short stories from Camilleri's various short story collections are ingeniously combined.  The character development of the principals and their inter-relationships  show more continuity than in the previous installments.  Although the series starts with the oncoming marriage of Livia and Salvo we see, movingly, why that doesn't happen.

My only complaint is the price.  In France, at Amazon.fr., I bought the 6 episodes for 24 Euros . . .subtitled in English.  So if you have a region 2 player, that's the way to go.",1468195200,2,637,5.0095238095238095

8761439,4,B01FRQCC1G,"Always entertaining and well-written, but prefer to watch him as a more mature character.",1513641600,,89,5.428571428571429
8761440,5,B01FRQCC1G,"Having read every Montalbano book and watched all of the 30 Montalbano shows made from the books, I was dubious about anything called ""The Young Montalbano.""  My concerns immediately evaporated the moment the shows started.  It's wonderful.  Somehow they got actors to play the characters as their younger selves.  They're PERFECT.  Every single one of them is believable and I would never have thought that possible.  If you liked Montalbano you will LOVE him as a younger man.",1507852800,,478,5.064102564102564
8761441,5,B01FRQCC1G,All good thanks,1501977600,,15,4.333333333333333
8761442,5,B01FRQCC1G,I like all of the Montalbano movies so far. This is the beginning of Montalbano in his younger years. I liked it very much.,1497398400,,123,4.166666666666667
8761443,5,B01FRQCC1G,This is a great series and the Sicilian scenery is spectacular.  Reading the subtitles is not really a problem and after a few episodes you find yourself understanding some Italian.,1495929600,,181,5.033333333333333
8761444,5,B01FRQCC1G,Excellent show.  Can't wait for next episodes.,1494892800,2,46,5.571428571428571

8761447,5,B01FRQCC1G,I have all the Montalbano episodes. I've been pleased that the Young Montalbano series has been just as good. It's entirely believable that these characters are younger versions of Mintalbank and his team.,1479772800,,205,5.242424242424242
