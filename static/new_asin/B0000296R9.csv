1251324,5,B0000296R9,"The Irish Tenors put forth so much emotion and talent in this video. Their renditions of old Irish classics such as Danny Boy and the Town I Loved so Well brought me to tears. They embody the feelings of sorrow and joy of  these songs. I adore this video and recommend it to anyone. If you liked  this video then you would love ""The Irish Tenors Live in  Belfast"". I will adore the Irish Tenors now and forever.",954288000,7,411,4.243589743589744
1251325,3,B0000296R9,These are the songs - sung in the style - that I grew up with prior to WWII!  I loved them then and it is wonderful to hear them again whenver I put the tape on!  My Grandparents came thru Canada and my Grandfather had a  great voice.,953337600,2,234,3.8333333333333335
1251326,5,B0000296R9,"Music video was never so good.  88 minutes of music that will stir your soul.  The three men, each with a style all their own, enthral you with their ability to communicate the meaning and emotion of their songs with  only their voices.",951436800,10,236,4.441860465116279
1251327,5,B0000296R9,"I was enthralled when I heard the quality of the singing on this video. The traditional song such as Danny Boy and Boolavogue were absolutely superb. I also very much enjoyed the more contemprorary ones such as The  Old Man and Grace.
Do yourself a favour  BUY THIS TAPE. words cannot do  it justice.",945648000,12,300,4.518518518518518
1251328,5,B0000296R9,"this video is great. It made me cry when Anthony Kearns sang, ""Grace."" This is a video everyone must have.",941932800,10,106,4.35
1251329,5,B0000296R9,"If you don't care for Irish music or beautiful voices then this video is not for you. For the rest of you, if you do not get this video you will be  missing out of one of life's golden moments. A glass of fine wine adds the  finishing touch.",941241600,8,241,3.8979591836734695
1251330,5,B0000296R9,"If you love music, and Irish music in particular, this is the video for you.  Over an hour of funny, sad, uplifting, tear starting songs by the world's three best tenors.  Each man is unique in voice and delivery of  song, yet they blend their talents to a harmonious perfection.  I can't get  enough of it.",939859200,,307,4.410714285714286

7915463,5,B0000296R9,"Where do I start?  I first watched this on a PBS fundraiser, and I had to have it!  With voices from John Mcdermott, Ronan Tynan, and Anthony Kearns you can't go wrong. When John Mcdermott sings ""Danny Boy"" it  brings goosebumps!  You can just see a mother giving her son her blessings  to go to America, yet knowing the next time they meet she will probably be  in the grave.  When John sings ""The Old Man"", WOW! The song is  about John missing his own deceased father. After listening to the song, I  immediately turned around and told my daddy I loved him. It really makes  you appreciate your father even more. Anthony Kearns is schooled in opera,  and his voice proves it. His voice is powerful, and beautiful.  When he  sung ""Grace"", I was literally brought to tears.  ""Grace"" is about a soldier, who is about to be executed in the  morning, saying good-bye to his wife (who he just married). It is powerful!  Ronan Tynan has a voice, that I am sure, can shatter glass. His voice is  strong yet beautifully controlled. I encourage viewers to research his  biography--it is very heart lifting. When he sings ""Town I Love So  Well"", you can just visualize the land, and fall in love with it  yourself! When the trio comes together and sing, it is an experience of a  lifetime.  ""Danny Boy"", when sang by all of them, is heavenly.  A  refreshingly fun song, ""Spanish Lady"", lets the trio have fun,  and interact with each other.  I highly recommend this video. After going  thru a rollercoaster ride of emotions, I cannot sing enough praises  (because I can't carry a tune in a bucket)!  It is simply out of this  world!",962496000,19,1623,4.496551724137931
7915464,5,B0000296R9,"My first exposure to The Irish Tenors was an 'accidental' clicking of the remote control one night when the local PBS station was conducting a fund-raising drive using the performance in Belfast. I was so moved by  their performance that I searched the web for more of their work,  disappointed that only one video was available. I ordered this video AND  the CD of both the Belfast performance and the Dublin performance. The  video helps me get through my time on the treadmill, and the CDs get  regular play on my computer. I'm still not sure which of the Tenors is my  favorite, as they are all so wonderful. The solos by Anthony Kearns, John  McDermott, and Ronan Tynan are wonderful, and the selections by the three  of them together are magnificent. The orchestral accompaniment raises the  performance of the old ballads to soaring heights. Kearns' eye contact with  the audience while singing ""Mountains of Mourne,"" ""Eileen  Og,"" and ""Darling Girl from Clare"" are priceless, and bring  chuckles every time. McDermott's ""The Old Man"" brings tears to my  eyes and a lump in my throat no matter how many times I experience it.  Tynan's ""The Town I Loved So Well"" tugs at the heart, as does the  trio's ""Only Our Rivers Run Free."" An unexpected bonus on the  video are the encore numbers that are not included on the CD, as well as  the most moving rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" that I've  heard.
As a result of watching this video, as well as the PBS  presentation of the Belfast concert, I've purchased CDs by the individuals,  and wonder when Kearns will grace us with an album of his own.",959990400,15,1596,4.652329749103942
7915465,5,B0000296R9,"We have literally worn out our video.  It is starting to skip.  No music in the world is more expressive or touching than Irish music, and these three outstanding tenors have given their hearts to their music.  We laugh,  cry and just sincerely enjoy watching this.  MORE, please.  Hopefully, this  will come out on DVD?",958694400,4,320,4.709090909090909
7915466,5,B0000296R9,"I got the cart before the horse, so to speak, and saw the last performance first (Live in Belfast). After that I bought the IRISH TENORS' CDs: THE IRISH TENORS, LIVE IN BELFAST, and HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. By the time I got  around to the first video, it was out of stock everywhere I looked. Today  it came in the mail. I was all alone. I dropped all the things I needed to  do and indulged myself. I had felt strong emotion with all the others, but  the Dublin program really got to me. Seeing--not just hearing--Anthony  Kearns sing ""Grace"" and ""Boulavogue"" brought me to  shameless tears. ""She Moved Through the Fair"" was a bonus. I  cannot imagine how one so young (at least he looks awfully young) can sing  with such feeling. Surely he cannot have experienced that much in his short  life! I had only seen John McDermott once in his brief appearance at the  Belfast performance, and I really enjoyed him. I'll have to confess  ""The Old Man"" made me cry, also, as did ""Only Our Rivers Run  Free"" by all three. Ronan Tynan's ""Kathleen"" and ""Sweet  Sixteen"" were touching. On the lighter side, ""Mountains of  Mourne,"" ""Will Ye Go, Lassie?"" ""Eileen Og,"" and  ""The Darling Girl from Clare"" never fail to bring a smile.  ""Believe Me,"" ""The Last Rose of Summer,"" and  ""Love's Old Sweet Song"" were in the GOLDEN BOOK OF FAVORITE SONGS  that we used in school. My dad used to sing ""Toora-Loora-Loora""  to me when I was very young. I can't find any of the songs I didn't  like--the ones that made me laugh as well as the sad ones. I can find no  words to express the delight these men have brought to me. I will say,  though, as another reviewer has noted, they certainly did loosen up between  Dublin and Belfast! They are the greatest, and I can't get enough of  them. Their web page is ""unavailable."" Is there an e-mail or  ""snail-mail"" address where I might write to them?",957139200,12,1869,4.442477876106195
7915467,5,B0000296R9,"I SAW THE IRISH TENORS ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY ON PBS,FOR THE SECOND TIME AND ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM AND THEIR MUSIC, I HAD TO HAVE THE CD'S AND VIDEO. WHEN I RECEIVED THEM I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THEM OVER AND OVER, I  CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THEM. THE MUSIC IS JUST BEAUTIFUL. JOHN, ANTHONY, AND  RONAN HAVE DONE AN EXQUISITE JOB. I SURE HOPE TO SEE MORE OF THEM. THEIR  VOICES ARE JUST WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO, I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THEM AND  THEIR MUSIC, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD THEM YOU ARE IN FOR A REAL TREAT.",955929600,10,523,4.048543689320389
