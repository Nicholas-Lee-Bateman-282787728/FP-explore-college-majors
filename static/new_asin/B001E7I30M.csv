8297048,5,B001E7I30M,"This is my favorite version of the Dickens tale. At a running time of over 300 minutes it is able to develop many of the nuances from the novel that generally end up on the cutting room floor in shorter filmed versions. This aired in the USA on the Disney Channel and was released on Laser Disc by Walt Disney Home Video. That Laser Disc set has great color, while this DVD import has greater sharpness. Now if only there was a Blu-ray...this could be the definitive telling, with superb acting from an A-list cast.",1466380800,3,515,4.431578947368421
