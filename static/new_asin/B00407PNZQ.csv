Heimat, always a pleasure to follow. I'm still watching: it is very long! It was like an encounter with your past, screened there just for me

Whilst the image quality on Heimat 3 is acceptable the dvd image quality on heimat 1 and 2 is disgraceful. The images were as good as (bad as) as old video from a second hand store that had been collecting dust for years. Blurred colours, distorted images, ghosting...these poor quality discs could not be saved by even the best dvd upscaling. Q. Do i feel riped off! A. big time! Beware Facets video. Do not waste good money on this item!",1302220800,20,584,4.4672897196261685
