8727196,1,B013C6OXTC,"Absolutely terrible.  This is an ""if I could give zero stars"" type of movie, or in this case, non-movie.

First of all, it's only 70 minutes long, but that is including a wraparound, bizarre spoof of USA Up All Night that serves no purpose whatsoever.  There are also some fake commercials thrown in to pad it out.

The movie itself is total and complete crap.  I would rather grade student films than watch this as paid, commercial entertainment.  No one can act; the direction is terrible, etc.

AVOID, NO QUESTION.  No one will like this movie, and anyone who says they like it obviously worked on it or has family or friends who did work on it.",1448236800,5,648,4.478632478632479

8727198,2,B013C6OXTC,"I bought this as a blind buy of Slasher Video's blu rays including Killer Workout, Shock Em Dead, and Deadly Prey. Those 3 were amazing so I had high hopes for this one but I was highly disappointed. I understand that it's a throwback movie but it wasn't very good. It was super slow and the acting was horrible. Sometimes blind buys work out great but this one I wish I could have back.",1448236800,8,387,4.243243243243243
8727199,3,B013C6OXTC,"Cinco De Mayo isn't a classic SOV film from the '80's, just to be crystal clear.

This slasher is just okay.  You get an interesting theme from the cultural aspect, but I wasn't enthralled with the actual product.  Kills are okay.  Nothing special.  There's no mystery, because the killer is identified early one (and it's very obvious).

I don't know.  I didn't dig it.  Just fair.  But not a piece of you know what.",1447977600,4,417,4.527027027027027
