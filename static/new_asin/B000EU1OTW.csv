8114564,5,B000EU1OTW,"The demonstrations on this DVD are very clear.  Will Fink gives an excellent measure by measure presentation of several tunes.  These tunes are embellished to be bluegrass flavored, with drones, pull-offs, hammer-ons, and bluesy slides, which makes it more desirable than just learning a set of straight fiddle tunes.  They include: Cripple Creek, Sweet Baby's Arms, Beneath The Willow, I'll Fly Away, 2 versions each of Bill Cheatham, John Hardy, Blackberry Blossom, and Salt Creek.  Exercises in cross-picking, scales, licks and sequences are also included.  The booklet is Tablature only, easy to read, and clearly marked with pick direction and chord symbols.  Not for strict beginners, a good 2nd DVD to work on.",1187913600,3,717,5.300884955752212
