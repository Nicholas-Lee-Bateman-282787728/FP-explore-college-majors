7896642,4,6305855757,"This is a collection of rare Kiss interviews spanning from apparently 1978 to 1992 (no years are given during the segments). The video box states that the quality isn't exactly perfect and that is true but none of it is terrible. Bare this in mind,should you want this. This isn't a regular,majorily produced video nor was it endorsed by Kiss but it is rare stuff that most likely you just won't see again. An example is a young Jerry Lewis introducing Kiss to give their help during a Lewis telephon for M.D. My guess is the year was '78 or '79. Pretty cool stuff.",1093478400,,565,4.4423076923076925
