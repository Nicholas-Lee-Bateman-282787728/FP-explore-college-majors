8124268,2,B000FKPEA6,"THE NUN OF MONZA opens w/ Sister Virginia de Layva (Zora Kerova) taking her final vows to become a nun. This is inexplicably spliced together w/ scenes of extreme horse copulation (!!) before a smiling group of admirers! Sister Virginia soon finds herself on the radar of the supremely grumpy Mother Superior (Franca Stoppi- THE OTHER HELL, BEYOND THE DARKNESS), after a man begins pursuing her (Virginia) romantically. Plagued by erotic Jesus dreams (!!!), Virginia begs her room-mate to punish her w/ a whip, which she does in grand style! Eeek! What is it w/ these naughty nun movies anyway? Meanwhile, the convent priest shows that his ""calling"" is just a job to him. Let's just say that he and one of the nuns have a deep, personal relationship! Yikes! Like others of its type, TNOM is simply a poke at the sanctimonious church, using sensuality to shock and cause as much offense as possible. For me, the best thing about this film is Stoppi, as she always plays her pious roles w/ gusto. Unfortunately, she's in it far too little. The rest is rather dull, and totally absurd. The birthing scene is especially ludicrous! Even the nudity and carnality wear out their welcome in these movies, since plot gives way to one-trick exploitation. Perhaps I need a break from nun-exploitation films, but this one seemed exceptionally tedious...",1424044800,,1341,4.885964912280702

8124271,5,B000FKPEA6,"AAA, what a good movie, I loved it, and watched it three times, it is worth more than what Paid, It contains lots of excitement, and that nymphomaniac girl needs more than one nurse to watch her.",1358640000,2,195,4.297297297297297
8124272,4,B000FKPEA6,"The nun of Monza is a movie that has been remade a few times. This version focuses on the corruption within a church that spirals beyond repair.  In short, this movie is explicit and somewhat violent. However, it is entertaining due to the shock value. I rate this movie with 4 stars. It is a bit far fetched, so, I could not give it a 5 star rating.",1201132800,8,350,4.147058823529412
