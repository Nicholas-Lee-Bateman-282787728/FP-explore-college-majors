Language... the most atrocious of all Polish speaking! Comedy??? Do they know what comedy is all about??? I couldn't watch the whole thing. I think it would take a bottle of vodka to be consumed before watching that atrocity!!! Not worth a cent to pay for. It looks like Polish cinematography is dead!!!",1306627200,,465,4.825
8067747,5,B0009W2XRW,"If you're a fan of Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels"" or ""Snatch"", you'll enjoy this film. ""Boys Don't Cry"" is more of a dark comedy than either of those two movies, but it's equally as whitty and just as hip.
It's available with English subtitles.",1241136000,,265,4.541666666666667
8067748,2,B0009W2XRW,"Just to set the record straight, I'd already seen Hilary Swank's Oscar-winning performance in the American film BOYS DON'T CRY (1999), so I knew the difference between it and this Polish film of the same title, albeit translated from CHLOPAKI NIE PLACZA.

In this lesser version of BOYS DON'T CRY, a virginal Polish teenager with acne problems, Oskarowi (Wojciech Klata), is convinced by his equally nerdy buddy Kuba (Maciej Stuhr), a music student, that his skin problems will be solved if he has sex. So, the two hire a couple of hookers from an escort agency run by Bolec (Michal Milowicz), the bumbling, gangster wannabe son of a Mafiosky bigshot. An unfortunate misunderstanding over the girls' fees cause their pimp to confiscate the valuable bust of a wizard belonging to one of the boys' uncles. Later, while attempting to buy the art piece back, Kuba is the awkward witness to the exchange of a suitcase of dirty money between Bolec and two tough guys from out of town sent to the former by his Old Man to do business. In the ensuing confusion, gunfire and wounds are exchanged, and the suitcase of cash disappears along with Kuba.

Perhaps some of the humor of this clumsy satire was lost in translation from the Polish dialog to English subtitles. But my wife, who's of Polish heritage and has a working knowledge of the language, gave up on the film after thirty minutes. In any case, the screenplay and quality of the acting reminded me of a goofy 1970s porn flick without the redeeming presence of any hardcore sex.

In my estimation, the only worthwhile scene was one in which Bolec, who thinks the Polish Mafia would benefit if its members adopted the smooth moves of Black rappers seen on American videos, has explained to him the historical origin of those same rappers - an explanation that wouldn't have made it past the ever-vigilant Stateside PC Police, but which I found positively endearing for its lack of political correctness.

A reluctant two stars.",1119139200,4,1977,4.805882352941176
