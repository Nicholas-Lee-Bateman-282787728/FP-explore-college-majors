2616945,5,B000GRUVUQ,"this video is worth ten times what i paid for it.  johnny is such and easy going guy and a great teacher.  he shows you just where he is on the fretboard and even gives string numbers and he goes slow enough even i could follow what he was doing.  i would love to meet him in person one day and thank him for producing this dvd.  i hope he makes more dvd's cause i will buy every one of them.  thanks johnny, and i know you have helped many people become better guitarist's.  i feel more confident already.  sincerely  cy vane",1252972800,3,526,4.088235294117647
2616946,4,B000GRUVUQ,"Johnny Hiland is a terrific country picker and you'll learn some interesting techniques for playing country-style guitar, as well as ways to incorporate a steel-guitar sound into your playing. However, Arlen Roth shows up to jam dressed (inappropriately!) in some really ugly shorts, displaying a truly gnarly-looking pair of legs, and, with his afro-style hairdo, ends up looking like Richard Simmons smarter-but-not-a-whole-lot-smarter brother. Ugh!",1232236800,5,451,6.0625
2616947,4,B000GRUVUQ,This really is an advanced lesson but is well worth it.  The live performance's are a great bonus too.,1217203200,,102,4.368421052631579
2616948,5,B000GRUVUQ,"This video provides detailed instruction in an easy to use format.  Not only does Johnny Hiland explain the material, he plays through each lick slowly and the licks can be slowed down to half speed while retaining the proper pitch.  The material he provides is practical and usable for the average guitarist.  As a bonus, there are three live performances where Johnny Hiland shows off his virtuosity.  It's worth every penny.",1196553600,7,427,4.971830985915493
2616949,4,B000GRUVUQ,"This is basically a training DVD for advanced Guitar players. However, Johnny Hiland is a ""jaw dropping"" guitar player and although I'm not a guitar picker I am an experienced musician. Hiland is one of the finest musicians I've ever seen. He is a wonderful combination of technical skills, talent, and amazing musicianship. The DVD was worth the price just to see and hear him play his amazing music.",1176163200,12,401,4.826086956521739
2616950,4,B000GRUVUQ,"Johnny's a great player, evidenced by some of the great live playing that is captured in the studio on this disc. He's also a really good teacher who takes the time to explain things and slow them down for you. I'm a fan of this style of music and if I compare this to the Brent Mason Nashville Chops video, which is also good, it's clear that though Johnny and Brent are both world class players, Johnny's a much better instructor.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone who likes the chicken picken' style.

Bonus footage of Arlen jamming with Johnny --and with Danny Gatton's old bandmates in the rhythm section!",1167350400,23,613,4.5636363636363635

2617012,5,B000GRUVUQ,"I love this DVD! To me, the solo performances alone were worth the money. Johnny introduces lots of techniques in this DVD to get you started. The slow motion and looping is also very cool for helping you to get the timing and memorize by playing along (slowly). I'm having fun with it. Exercises aside.. Again.. the solo performances contain a wealth of cool licks and progressions. Johnny is AWSOME and one heck of a nice guy. Cheers!",1386720000,,436,4.602564102564102
2617013,5,B000GRUVUQ,"Johhny Hiland is a natural teacher who gives clear, specific directions that are easy to understand and practice.

2617016,4,B000GRUVUQ,"This is a very nice look at Johnny Hiland's playing style and influences.  His teaching style may not be at the level of his playing but there is much to learn for the serious student of country guitar.  It is not sequential or well organized, but what the heck - neither am I. More importantly I found the licks and suggestions he offered to be a springboard for new ideas of my own. . .",1367020800,,388,4.16

2617018,3,B000GRUVUQ,Good lessons but needs supplemental information. I returned the DVD because there was no booklet or scrolling of tab as mentioned on DVD cover. This is a ten year old project that was put on DVD. Needs to be redone.,1356480000,3,215,4.4
2617019,5,B000GRUVUQ,I like this DVD very much. Johnny Hiland is a very good teacher. He is naturally talented for teaching guitar.,1295481600,4,110,4.55
2617020,4,B000GRUVUQ,"I usually do not like lesson videos, This one really turned my head. I caught a couple clips of Johnny playing on you tube. Wow
this guy is amazing, great tone! smoking chops! and best of all pretty humble and likable guy. The video is more than the usual hey check this out lightning lick of the week. His playing is well described on the video and in the booklet, which includes tab and standard notation. I like to have both these days. Johnny also talks a bit about his influences and gives them credit (Danny Gatton, Albert Lee) As much as I like this lesson Video (and I really do like it) a little more theory would be cool,
Just a little why can make the learning easier. And this is not for stone cold beginners, If you can play pentatonic minor, blues  scales you'll be ok with some work. It has given me a new love when playing.",1265414400,15,839,4.24375
8134249,5,B000GRUVUQ,To me this is a fantastic DVD!!! I LOVE Johnny Hiland and everything he does. The dvd is a little old now but still it has some really pretty decent licks in there and Johnny takes you through them nice and slow. Funny to see Johnny so stiff in front of the camera!!

8134255,5,B000GRUVUQ,"Delicious Telecastering by a great deciple of Danny Gatton. This is my fifth Hot Licks video and it's the best.  I recommend it to all guitar geeks.  All of the other Hot Licks videos that I've bought have provided great insight into the particular artists' music and their techniques, but Johnny Hiland is the probably the best instructor.  I know that this video will help me.  His lessons are well planned and constructed.  He starts with something simple, demonstrates it thoroughly taking his time, and then builds on those lessons by combining techniques.  The jam sessions with Arlen Roth and the guys are terrific.  And as a parting treat, Johnny walks you through his rig.",1421366400,2,681,4.869565217391305

8134257,2,B000GRUVUQ,I was disappointed with the way Johnny taught this.  It was almost like I was supposed to know how to use my fingers to accomplish this style of picking.,1405555200,,153,4.275862068965517
8134258,4,B000GRUVUQ,Johnny is a great guitar picker and this dvd proves that not only is he a great picker but an excellent instructer id recommed this to any up and coming l ead player,1395360000,,165,4.03030303030303
