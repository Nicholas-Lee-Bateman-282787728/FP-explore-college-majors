7062400,5,B00UN7FHCG,Love this movie,1426809600,,15,4.333333333333333
7062401,5,B00UN7FHCG,"One of my favorite Myazaki films though most people don't attribute it to him because Lupin the Third is a separate manga. Miyazaki asked if he could make a film off of the comic book characters--Monkey Punch (the author) was flattered that such a talented artist like Hayao Miyazaki would want to make a film from his comic and agreed. Interestingly, Monkey Punch wasn't involved in the production like most other artists would be. In an interview he said he was nervous about how it would turn out, and was surprised because the characters were tweaked slightly to be more appropriate for a younger audience.
Bear this in mind while watching the film because it isn't 100% true to Lupin the Third, however it is definitely true to Miyazaki. If you love Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service, or Porco Rosso, you'll love this.",1487721600,,832,4.744827586206896
7062402,5,B00UN7FHCG,This movie was a Christmas gift to my daughters and as we sat down and watched it I couldn't help but notice this kind of reminded me of a Inspector Gadget episode. It was fun to watch I don't like to do full reviews on certain items all I can really say is recommend Yes Fun Yes buy it well watch a pro reviewer of this movie then you decide that's what I did.,1483315200,,361,3.891891891891892
7062403,5,B00UN7FHCG,Exactly what I ordered! Love it!,1483142400,,32,4.5
7062404,3,B00UN7FHCG,I prefer the disney version. Must be a copyright thing or something with this version. The move is a good movie but would like a voice over version by disney and a Japanese version. Speaking both languages I tend to prefer the english versions better. In my haste to buy this version I did not realize until I got it that it was a blu-ray only.,1481155200,,344,4.2272727272727275
7062405,4,B00UN7FHCG,"It's so great to have this on blu-ray! It's not as high quality as Disney Hayao Miyazaki features but there isn't swearing Disney features either lol there is a family friendly version in English but all of the voices are mono or stereo, no surround hence the 4 stars.",1480291200,,268,4.489795918367347
7062406,5,B00UN7FHCG,My son's favorite since he was 5. This is the very first and the best Hayao Miyazaki's animation movie. Funny and likable characters and the adventurous but heart warming story is definitely for all ages. Even my father and husband laughed and applauded at the end.,1473120000,5,265,4.782608695652174

7062409,5,B00UN7FHCG,"This blu-ray release features the new and old English dubbing, with the intro music restored. It looks beautiful, a testament to blu-ray quality. Sound quality is great too. I was worried that the blu-ray would have some quirk or strangeness that made it undesirable; not so. I am very happy.

If you are new to anime, well, so am I. My friend put this on for me once and I wondered where it had been all my life. If you love adventure films, like Indiana Jones, and you grew up loving Duck Tales and stuff like that, prepare to be dazzled. It is also just very charming in a distinctly Japanese sort of way. The animation is astounding, and the background paintings are lavish and really give the whole thing a level of artistry that is unmatched even in this post-Pixar world. I love cars, and obviously the people who made this do too. You will want a Fiat 500 after watching this.

I own three blu-rays and this is one of them! The other two are Unforgiven and the third season of Star Trek Next Generation. Just in case you were wondering.",1463270400,13,1044,4.404145077720207

7062414,5,B00UN7FHCG,"You can find my full review here: http://www.fandompost.com/2015/05/25/lupin-iii-the-castle-of-cagliostro-collectors-edition-blu-ray-anime-review/ but below are a couple brief points:

Audio:
There are six audio tracks present here including the original Japanese track in mono, as well as in 5.1 surround sound. We also get the 1992 English audio track produced by Streamline Pictures in mono, the 2000 English dub done by Manga Entertainment in stereo, a family friendly version of the Manga dub, and finally a commentary track hosted by Reed Nelson of lupinthethird.com, whos pretty darned competent doling out info.

Its interesting to hear how these tracks vary a bit. Both the English dubs are decently acted. The Streamline Pictures dub directed by the late Carl Macek had the usual actors you would hear in their Akira and Robotech dubs, anchored with some perfectly goofy voicework from Bob Bergen as Lupin himself. A couple things are a bit off though in that Lupin himself is referred to as The Wolf because there was a legal with the estate of Maurice Leblanc, creator of the original Arsene Lupin character Lupin III is derived from (see below for more). This is understandable, given the issue. However, the script is written so that his partner Jigen refers to Lupin as his Boss which, never quite rings true given their association, as theyve always acted more like partners than employer / subordinate. Also, the mixing is a bit different from the others in that dialogue and music tend to be higher than foley like gunshots at times.

The Manga Entertainment dub directed by the late Kevin Seymour (for which he himself portrayed Inspector Kenji Zeningata) punches up the foley effects a bit while mixing really good performances by David Hayter as Lupin and Ivan Buckley as Jigen among others. Of course, theres no replacing Yasuo Yamadas zaniness with certified cool as the original Lupin, but the American casts do acquit themselves well. Meanwhile the score by Yuji Ohno is an excellent mix of 70s style French Connection action, whimsical stylistic jazz and simple harp & piano combos that that you through many moods of excitements, drama and sorrow the screenplay possesses.

Video:
The video is in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen and fits perfectly onto the TV. The general colors are brighter with the blues and greens benefiting the most from this treatment. There are song subtitles in blue and white for a couple vocal pieces on here. Also, though, in addition to the regular subtitles in yellow, you have the option of using closed captioned subtitles in yellow (which take the regular subtitles and add sound effects in the key moments for hearing impaired). Also present are the subtitles from the 1980 international releases so you can see big white blocky text in times new roman font, same translation and all. So you can see Inspector Zeningata referred to as Ed Cott if you want, just like the original trailer for Mystery of Mamo.

In Summary:
When movie collectors talk about The Criterion Collections of movies with awe and respect, its because they know the people behind those releases put a lot of time and energy into putting out a good product to not only entertain but educate the person spending money on the DVDs at hand, as well as tapes and laserdiscs in years gone by. If theres an equivalent to Criterions for American anime releases, it would be Lupin III: Castle Cagliostro  Collectors Edition.",1450742400,4,3444,5.054577464788732

7062422,4,B00UN7FHCG,"This is one of the first films Hayao Miyazaki ever directed, its technically not a Studio Ghibli film. Its still got some nice art and a solid story line. The film was originally a T.V movie based off of a popular anime in Japan. Lupin is a great character to follow, fun, charming, and a top notch thief. His world is one of adventure and several near death experiences. It might take a few watches to get warmed up to it, but overall I liked this film enough to buy it.",1445472000,,471,4.186813186813187

7062436,4,B00UN7FHCG,"The Castle of Cagliostro is a very good film. Although I have not seen any of Miyazaki's work for television, apparently The Castle of Cagliostro is more representative of his early career. The story is a fairly simple, straightforward action-comedy. Although simple, the story is fairly engaging, and the physical comedy is excellent. The animation may not have the polish of a Ghibli production, but it is still bursting with energy. I'd say it's quite an entertaining film, but not quite a classic like many of Miyazaki's later films.

The quality of the Blu-ray transfer is quite nice, definitely an improvement from the Manga Entertainment DVD release. The Blu-ray has the original Japanese with a new sub translation, the Manga Entertainment dub, with David Hayter (voice of Solid Snake) as Lupin, the early 90s Streamline Pictures dub, and a 'family-friendly' version of the Manga Entertainment dub that cuts out the swearing from said dub. There's also an audio commentary track by Reed Nelson, who is just a fan. But the audio commentary is very well-researched, and I learned quite a few things I didn't know. So there are a lot of different ways to watch the movie, which is kind of cool.

The bonus features are excellent. Of course, you've got your storyboards, which is is a standard for any Miyazaki/Ghibli release. But there are a ton of interviews, some concept art, etc. The bonus features were clearly compiled by people who love the material, which is great to see.",1439596800,,1485,4.936

7062447,5,B00UN7FHCG,"Before founding Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki debuted as a film director with this rollickingly fun installment in the long-running Lupin III franchise. While not as virtuosic as later Miyazaki masterpieces like My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away, Cagliostro is a whole lot of fun; full of lovable characters, amazing action sequences (if you've been watching cartoons for the past three decades you've probably seen some blatant steals from the iconic final battle), and the beautiful visuals you come to expect from Miyazaki... even if they're not quite as grand as they'd get later in his career.

It's been a long time since I've been overwhelmed by the amount of special features on a release. Back in the DVD heyday releases would be loaded with extras, but now that we're in the age of Blu-Ray and downloads/streaming there's been a lot less, so I was shocked by this release. It includes multiple interviews, commentary, storyboards, trailers, an overview of the production, two different English dubs, and nifty packaging - but by far the weirdest extra is the option to watch the film with the oddly formatted and frequently incorrect English subtitles that the film had during it's original U.S. debut in the early '80s when it was screened at festivals and conventions. I'm sure only a few dozen nostalgic fans would even be curious about such a thing, but serious props to including something so obscure and bizarre!",1437004800,3,1431,5.037974683544304
7062448,5,B00UN7FHCG,Really fun movie that I wish I got into earlier.,1436918400,,48,3.9
7062449,3,B00UN7FHCG,"Man. I love this movie. Lovelovelove it. So of course pre order was mandatory for the bluray.

Packaging: Great
Menus: Great
Special Features: Great

Like its obvious mad love was put into this project, as it should be.

But oh man, they butchered the video in my opinion. Straight away, im noticing a very 'stuttery' image, not smooth at all. and my eyes are burning from how bright it is, its almost like they threw a coat of bleach over the negative and then re-drew the outlines of everything. WAY too bright. And any element of grain in the image is completely gone, which it shouldn't be for a film of this age. Rookie mistake with restoration. i compared with my older dvd copy and while that is a LOT darker, the animation is smooth and grain is there, so unfortunately thats still my preferred copy of COC :(

Just as a comparison , i threw on the Disney Bluray of Nausicaa on straight after this and i wept with joy at how perfect they got it. Just the right amount of grain, beautiful image. I was in heaven. Thats how its done guys.",1436918400,,1044,4.365979381443299
7062450,5,B00UN7FHCG,"I'm reviewing the recent Discotek release, which is quite possibly the classiest and most complete production of the film that's been released in the West.  The packaging is absolutely gorgeous, and the DVD menus show an absolute love for the artistry of the film.  And we finally get back the full intro sequence that TMS had so bizarrely replaced with stills in Manga's previous Disney-style release!  What more could you ask for?  It's honestly a shame that the reviews section for the blu-ray release has been unceremoniously lumped together with the reviews of older releases, because many of the complaints from prior versions of the film are fixed in Discotek's release.  Otherwise, we'd see a perfect 5 stars across the board!

This version actually contains 3 dubs --- the original Streamline dub produced in the early 90's, as well as the original Manga dub and a family-friendly version of the Manga dub especially made for this release.  It was great to finally have a chance to experience the Streamline dub, which is a more straightforward, yet maybe overall more consistent and friendlier performance than Manga's later production (Lupin certainly comes across more as a charming and enthusiastic mischief-maker, than Manga's maybe more overly confident rendition).  They're both well-made dubs with their ups and downs, and both are great ways to experience the movie I think.  And now there's a family-friendly version of the Manga dub that brings the film closer to its original form, a welcome addition for anyone who enjoyed the film but felt some of the cursing felt out of place or unnecessarily edgier than it needed to be.

As for the film itself, what more can be said?  It's truly one of the great masterpieces of animation and directing, helmed by the now world-famous but then up-and-coming director Hayao Miyazaki, best known for his works with Studio Ghibli.  The film has an incredible sense of tangibility to it --- the picturesque European countryside and architecture serve as much more than a simple backdrop, but are important parts of the film itself, something you don't often see in animation or films in general.  This is no more true than at the film's titular location, the Castle of Cagliostro, whose layout, enormity and structure are incredibly well-realized and explored throughout the film.  Besides the consistently clever and well structured plotting, story-telling and pacing, this sense of unity between the actors and the world they inhabit give the film an incredibly immersive life that few films are yet to match.  To think that a film of such incredible craftsmanship could be created more than 30 years ago is a testament to the artistry and talent of its creative team.

If the Castle of Cagliostro could have been an ending cap to Lupin's great adventures as a world-class thief, it would be the classiest and most well-deserved send-off the series could get.  A phenomenal film that film-goers of all backgrounds are sure to appreciate and remember for years to come, finally in a package that lives up to the film's reputation.  My absolute highest recommendation!",1435881600,3,3125,5.046692607003891
7062451,5,B00UN7FHCG,"I'll first review the movie and then the dvd layout.
Firstly, for those concerned about curse words and children picking up on it, as a fellow parent, I'm not at all worried (especially since your children WILL end up learning what they are, whether they watch South Park behind your back or their school friends spew it). There is one mild blood scene, and a few close deaths to the main character, so if your kids aren't mature enough to handle this... Don't expose them to the film.
Otherwise, this whimsical tale of about a thief will steal your heart. Additionally, this is Miyazaki's first film, so the complaints about the art not being ""up to par..."" I'll leave you to judge. I'm a Lupin the Third and Hayao fan, so my opinions are fairly subjective.
The dvd setup is sort of silly, but having no ads is always nice. There's not a significant ""behind the scenes"" portion, but this movie was made in 1979, so what do you expect?",1435622400,,935,4.5058823529411764
7062452,5,B00UN7FHCG,"(review of the 2015 Blu-ray release. This is Not a review of the movie or any past releases of the movie)

Pros:
The slipcover, case, and disc all feature different artwork. The one shown in the picture is the artwork on the slipcover.
The video quality is as good, if not better, as any of the Disney remasters of the other older Studio Ghibli movies.
It contains the original Japanese audio, the 1992 dub, and the 2000 Animaze dub.
It's got a pretty good amount of special features.

Cons:
The 1992 dub, which in my opinion is vastly superior to the 2000 dub, is only in mono. The 2000 dub is in stereo, but considering the fact that this version doesn't have nearly as good voice acting or as good of a translation,  you basically have to listen to this movie in mono which is completely ridiculous for a 2015 Blu-ray.",1435622400,,821,4.423841059602649

7062454,5,B00UN7FHCG,"Just finished watching; along with Jeff H., ""Lupin The Third - The Castle Of Cagliostro"" released by Eastern Star.
Directed by legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki, ""The Castle of Cagliostro"" has all the elements of a Studio Gibli movie that Miyazaki fans love about his movies - lush animation and complex story lines that weave viewers in the story and make them long for more once the film comes to an end.
After a daring heist at a casino in Monte Carlo, master thief Lupin the Third and his earnest-while partner-in-crime Jigen discover in their get-a-way car as their eluding the police on their tails that the millions of dollars they've just stolen is counterfit - and darn good ones at that.  After literally throwing the money out of the car as a smoke screen to snarl up traffic and make good their escape - after all who wants a life of ease filled with beautiful women provided with counterfeit funds - Lupin decides their nest destination is Cagliostro - a tiny European country that is the source of the phony money and the only place where - as a young thief just starting out on his own - that Lupin was nearly captured; but was aided in his escape by a young girl.
Once safely passed the border, Lupin and Jigen are immediately caught up in a wild car chase - criminal thugs after a young woman in a wedding dress.  Springing to her aid, Lupin and Jigen fail to rescue her; but obtain a clue to her identity - she is the Royal Duchess of Cagliostro and she is being forced into a marriage she doesn't want to the creepy Count Cagliostro so that he can obtain the final clue to a vast and lost treasure.
""Believe in the thief,"" Lupin tells Clarisse - the duchesses.  She is the one who once save Lupin and now he is going to return the favor by saving her.
""The Castle of Cagliostro"" harkens back to Hollywood's Golden Age of romance and adventure and is a tale that will enchant the first time and the 100th time you watch it.

Best picture quality (anamorphic this time, AND no substituted opening), best sound quality (original Japanese in both mono and 5.1, plus both the Streamline and Manga English dubs), a good supply of extras, etc.  If you're a fan, and have been hoping to find a better copy of it than any of the previous releases, GET THIS ONE!!",1435363200,3,435,4.425
7062457,5,B00UN7FHCG,"Amazing adventure, but Fujiko is absent from it which was not to my liking. That said it's still a great film with stellar animation, and the audio options and extras nothing short of comprehensive. It's not quite a Ghibli film, and not quite a Lupin film, so fans of either may see it as a bit off, but it's still very entertaining.

Edit: Fujiko is more active than i remember in this movie, but she is still out of character. For that that reason, Cagliostro is not a good entrance to Lupin for those who have only seen ""The Woman Called Fujiko Mine"", but it's great for almost every other audience.

7062459,5,B00UN7FHCG,"Get this blu ray & throw away all of the previously released DVD.  This blu ray is perfect for me, it has multiple versions of english audio tracks along with Japanese audio tracks.  You can also find multiple versions of subtitle tracks.  This blu ray also has All Special Features including an audio commentary.  Therefore, Get this bluray.",1435017600,2,342,4.844827586206897
7062460,5,B00UN7FHCG,"There are two Lupin TV episodes directed by Hayao that I wish was on the upcoming Blu-Ray release. (I can dream, can't I?). 'Albatross: Wings of Death' (S4:E145, aired July 28, 1980), and 'Aloha, Lupin' (aka, 'Farewell My Beloved Lupin')(S4:E155, aired October 6, 1980). Both were released on tape under 'Lupin III's Greatest Capers' in the mid-90's. Both of these episodes are FANTASTIC. You can catch ""Albatross"" on YouTube, but, I haven't seen ""Aloha"" since I was in Japan in 1983/84.

Edit: HA! After a quick Google, I found both on good quality free on HULU. Check them out!

Another Edit: Want to see Hayao Miyazaki at work in Studio Ghibli? Watch documentary, 'The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness' (aka, 'Yume To Kyki No Ohkoku'). It's not currently streaming on Amazon Prime, but it is on Netflix. ALSO...the potential last Studio Ghibli animated movie 'When Marnie Was There' has a U.S. theatre release date of May 22, 2015. (See YouTube trailers for what that looks like). (Japan had the movie premiere middle of last year, with a recent Blu-ray/DVD release.)",1427241600,3,1067,4.9222222222222225
8707520,5,B00UN7FHCG,SO excited to finally have the older English dub - I know it's not as accurate to the Japanese but it's the version I grew up with! So glad to not have to watch my VHS version anymore!,1523404800,,184,3.8684210526315788
8707521,5,B00UN7FHCG,One of my favorite movies. Just one mad event after another. A cousin to the Indiana Jones movies. Has to be seen to be enjoyed. This blu ray is a great remastering and the subtitles are an improvement over the original.,1521072000,,220,4.390243902439025

8707523,5,B00UN7FHCG,This is easily one of my favorite anime movies of all time.  It is beautifully animated. It has a great soundtrack and great characters.  You couldn't ask for more.  They don't make anime like this anymore.,1514505600,,206,4.666666666666667

8707526,5,B00UN7FHCG,Hayao Miyazaki's first feature film gets a great treatment in this BluRay. Prefer the Japanese dialog with English subtitles (adjusted for widescreen television screens) but happy to have the two previous English language dubs as well. Seems to include all the extras from old DVD versions.,1501286400,,290,5.326086956521739
8707527,5,B00UN7FHCG,"As an early Miyazaki film, the viewer gets a unique blend of the director's wimzy with the good hearted nature of Lupin franchise.  The music is enjoyable, the characters well acted by a talented cast and the story made some years before the Princess Bride will have any viewer familiar surprised by what they see.  I have watched this film several times since buying it earlier this year and would recommend any anime or Miyazaki fan add it to their list.",1499904000,,456,4.617283950617284
