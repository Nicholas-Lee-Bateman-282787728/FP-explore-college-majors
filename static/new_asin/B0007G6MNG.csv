8047109,3,B0007G6MNG,"Master With Cracked Fingers(1971) is a lesser Jackie Chan movie, but it's still worth watching. Sources claim that the footage of the real Jackie Chan was filmed in 1971 while the footage of Chan's double was shot in 1978. Jackie Chan talked a bit about this movie in his autobiography co-written by Jeff Yang. It's also known as Snake Fist Fighter and The Little Tiger From Canton. Jackie Chan's character is called ""Jackie Chan"" in the English dubbing. He's raised by an ex-gangster after they kill his father. Chan learns kung fu from The Man Who Isn't There(Simon Yuen). He uses his kung fu to protect his family from gangsters. Annoying English dubbing is hard to put up with, but the English dubbing on my DVD copy is decent. The loopers play it straight. There's stock music from 2001: A Space Odyssey(1968), Superman(1978), Sorcerer(1977) Popeye(1934), and Dawn of the Dead(1978). The scenes with Chan are closer in spirit to The Big Boss(1971) and the scenes with Simon Yuen are closer in spirit to Drunken Master(1978). There are some low brow gags such as Simon Yuen ""passing gas"" in a gangster's face! Master With Cracked Fingers has gotten ratings ranging from 10 stars to -10 stars!
 Jackie Chan claims in his book I am Jackie Chan that working conditions on the movie were poor. The crew used cameras that were broken and old fashioned. Chan did whatever made sense in front of the camera. This film has some B-movie ""hooks"".
Master With Cracked Fingers/Little Tiger From Canton got an R rating from the MPAA in the United States. The strong violence in the film is actually quite limited. Some prints of the movie show the flashbacks during the last 90 minutes. There are more than four alternate endings to this movie! The kung fu fights in Master With Cracked Fingers are quite solid and exciting. Tien Feng(Sword of Swords, Fist of Fury, A Better Tomorrow) played Chan's on-screen father. Master With Cracked Fingers was released in the US and UK around the same time that The Big Brawl(1980) was shown in movie theaters. Master With Cracked Fingers is a love it or hate it kind of movie. Judge it for yourself.",1329782400,2,2130,4.756756756756757
