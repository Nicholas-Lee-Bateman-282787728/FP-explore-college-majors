5737581,4,B00CS7PIYG,"For those of us who are Baltimore Ravens fans, and remember the terrific 2000 season, especially the great defense, and the 34-7 victory over the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV, NFL Network and NFL Films have produced this approximately 50-minute documentary in their AMERICA'S GAME: THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS series.  In addition to game footage and radio play-by-play from the Ravens' then-broadcasters, Scott Garceau and former Baltimore Colts great Tom Matte (of WLIF/WQSR), there are candid interviews with Head Coach Brian Billick, Super Bowl XXXV MVP Ray Lewis (including an honest discussion of the 2000 murder case in Atlanta), and quarterback Trent Dilfer, who did not get as much credit as he deserved for the Super Bowl victory.

Interestingly, I was able to copy the latter video onto DVD, but not the former, because of copy protection.  So keep these VHS tapes if you have them.

I've already pre-ordered the Super Bowl XLVII DVD (Ravens 34, San Francisco 49ers 31) and can't wait to receive that one, as well as the companion AMERICA'S GAME episode when it is released on DVD.  GO RAVENS!!",1360713600,,1603,6.364055299539171
5737582,5,B00CS7PIYG,This DVD is so exciting.  I have season tickets to the RAVENS games and this DVD brought more insight to what really happened that season.  Our first Superbowl....loved the DVD.,1360540800,3,177,4.866666666666666
5737583,5,B00CS7PIYG,"As the Ravens contend for their second appearance in the Super Bowl, this was a great thing to watch again.  In light of the fact that Ray Lewis is still playing, it just gives me goose bumps to watch it again.",1358208000,,210,4.121951219512195
5737584,5,B00CS7PIYG,"I couldn't think of anything to get my uncle that he did have, but I noticed that he did not a copy of the 2000 superbowl video. I'm sure when he opens it on Christmas he will be excited. Great working with the sellers. Got it to me in record time.",1355616000,2,248,3.8823529411764706
5737585,3,B00CS7PIYG,"Pros: the production quality is very good.  It has some of the usual super close ups and super slow motion that we expect from NFL Films productions.  The DVD includes material from the beginning of the season, to the superbowl, and also talks about Ray Lewis's indictment, legal trouble, and its impact on the team.  The three people who reappear in interviews are Brian Billick, Ray Lewis, and Trent Dilfer.  The extra features are mostly extended interviews with these three.

Cons: it is quite short, 45 minutes, not the advertised 55 minutes, unless you count the extra features.  There are only a few minutes, I'd estimate 3 or 4, devoted to the superbowl.  There are probably 9 or 10 other games throughout the season that get this much coverage on the DVD, with the rest of the time going to interviews.  What I was hoping for was 30 minutes of highlights of the superbowl game itself.",1248134400,7,893,4.67948717948718
5737586,5,B00CS7PIYG,"As always NFL Films produces a top notch DVD on one if it's top teams & this is certainly one of my ultimate favorites especially since it's more than a rundown of the Baltimore Ravens championship season but it also takes a personal approach to the players & coaching staff. One of my favorite parts is when they talk about Ray Lewis because he really takes his game seriously & he's probably the biggest team leader in all of the NFL. Also you see the pressure that Lewis had to face from the NFL, news media & the fans as a result of his going to trial for murder charges despite his continual self proclaimed innocence. All in all, this is an EXCELLENT well-produced documentary that really showcases not only one of the greatest defensive NFL teams of all time but digs down deep in the heart of the game itself.",1241308800,6,817,4.417218543046357

5737589,5,B00CS7PIYG,"The first DVD has a duration of 1 hour and 17 minutes and is a summary of the baltimore ravens' season  2000 by the first spring training to the triumph of the SB, through highlights from all 16 games of the regular season and the playoffs.
the second disc runs for 2 hours and 2 minutes, and is the total coverage of  SB XXXV from coin toss up in the festivities of ray lewis and company.
