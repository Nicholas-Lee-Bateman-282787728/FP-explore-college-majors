Film = solid three (3) stars; restoration/preservation = five (5) stars; locations = four (4) stars; score = four (4) stars; cinematography = 3.5 stars; subtitles/translations = two (2) stars.  Veteran Shochiku Director Yoshitarou Nomura presents a multidimensional, deeply disturbing drama dealing with unwanted children who may or may not be the result of a spineless, philandering husband.  Nomura masterfully mixes a wide-range of ingredients into his pot including: a likeable slacker protagonist who is skimming profits from a small-business print shop to support his mistress and her three illegitimate children; his hard-working wife who does not want (or even seem to like) children; child abandonment on the print-shop's door step by the mistress and later duplicated by the protagonist; attempted and successful child murders by the print-shop couple; skillful detective work by the police; and the eventual imprisonment of the husband (but not his wife).  The film is for sure about violence directed against children, but is also about other matters such as how dire circumstances can force unwilling (and sympathetically portrayed) folks to engage in unforgivable cruelty.  (Apparently this photoplay is based on a real police case.)  The Director's scenes of good-cop-bad-cop interrogation of a child who survives an attempted murder are classic.  Acting by adults is outstanding across the board.  Not so much for the children who come across as mostly artificial.  Their physical bits of business are believable.  But their stony-faced, monotone deliveries using words/phrases unlikely to be spoken even by precocious kids of that age seem phony and can lessen the impact of adult performers sharing a scene.  (Directing child actors is rarely a piece of cake!)  Choice of exterior small-town/rural locations is very effective.  Cinematography (1.85:1, color) and inter-scene lighting can be uneven especially for some beach/cliff scenes.  Score is inventive, lush, and haunting; but a bit too heavy duty for some scenes.  Subtitles/translations need work.  Not all dialog delivered by children is subtitled.  Signs (of which there are many) almost never are translated.  Disturbing yet compelling.
