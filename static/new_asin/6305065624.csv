955967,4,6305065624,"I had a pleasant surprise after seeing the video Habitat.  The surprise was that it was quite well done (no pun intended) and rather uplifting.  I have since had to add the DVD to my collection.
The Earth's ozone layer has been completely destroyed.  People stay indoors and only dare to venture out at night.  But one scientist is looking to bring back the greenery, but indoors.  Combining fungi and various plants, the scientist hopes to create a new ecosystem.  Runaway failures have forced him and his family to be on the run.  At his latest location an underground pocket of water causes a disaster in the basement lab and the organisms mutate and spread through the house.  The scientist becomes infected with the new organisms and dies (or so it seems).
As the new ecosystem gains more control of the house, it is learned that the scientist is not dead, but has been transformed into an energy-like state.  In this state he is able to attack people and make them immune to the sun's burning rays.  But eventually the authorities catch up and try to stop the ecosystem.  While they manage to destroy quite a bit, they are unsuccessful at stopping this new hope for the world.  Man will no longer have to huddle in the dark and rely on artificial foods.
I really enjoyed this one.  I was expecting some fun schlock but found higher quality lurking in the cheesy box.  The necessity of camera angles and visibility make the sun shades look rather inefficient but all in all quite well done.",1088380800,10,1495,4.613636363636363
955968,4,6305065624,"Yep!  It's me again.  You must think all I do is sit around and watch movies.  You're right.  In a stressful job this is the best therapy.  At work I earn every penny of my salary.  At play (home) I indulge in my love for film.

So what did I think of the Science Fiction thriller ""Habitat""?  It's definitely for Sci Fi folks...only.  It is a bizzarre tale of what happens when the ozone layer is destroyed and mankind must shield itself from the microwave effect of sunlight.

So why is it called ""Habitat""?  An obsessed scientist and his beautiful and sexy wife, create their own environment inside the confines of their home...a vegetation filled fantasyland of plants and flowers that literally ooze with life.

This one plays out like an expanded episode of ""The Outer Limits""...but it is definitely ""R"" rated for the seductive passions of mom and girlfriend.  Quite bizzarre.  A definite 8 on my 10-scale for Sci Fi.  Many people did not like this flick.  I was intrigued and thoroughly entertained.  A great Friday Night flick...in early November...alone in my own HABITAT.

955969,3,6305065624,"Yup, Alice Krige and Laura Harris showing their gorgeous bods is the ""best"" thing about this film.
There's really not a whole lot to say about a film that seems like it was probably originally an exciting-sounding concept to its creators, but ended up being somewhat....blah. I'm not sure how they could have pulled off a film in which a family's house turns into a living jungle, and the Dad turns into some sort of weird creature which can break down into little green molecules and fly around because of his science experiments. The neighbors who dislike them get killed trying to put a stop to the house's growth. Okay. BUT...
Laura goes for a nice skinny-dip, which makes this essential viewing for any Celeb skin collector.",1056153600,8,729,4.748031496062992
955970,1,6305065624,"My first impression of Habitat was that this was gonna be a really underrated and overlooked sci-fi gem, but the end results are one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The storyline is intriguing and interesting, but the screenplay and direction are overly sloppy, not to mention that Balthazar Getty and Tcheky Karyo are wasted in their roles, if they're acting talents were better used, this movie might have been not so bad.  One good quality though, there is some nice T&A, and I never realized how hot Alice Krige was until I saw this, but other than that this movie is a waste.",1025827200,2,587,4.528301886792453
955971,1,6305065624,"Unless you're into self torture skip this one.  Being a Sci-fi/horror fan I picked it up one day to watch.  Big mistake.  This is one of the worst, if not THE worst, movies I have ever seen.  It's two hours of your life you won't ever be able to get back!",1013990400,,255,3.9411764705882355
955972,5,6305065624,"Professor Hecht's ""Environmentalism Past, Present and Future"" Film series Kick-off Event
Theme:  ""Understanding Environmental Change"" Primary Reference:  ""The Forgiving Air"" by Richard C. J. Somerville, Secondary References:  Kindred Nature by Gates, Requiem for Nature by Terborgh and The Death of Nature by Carolyn Merchant
Film:  Habitat Director: Renee Daalder
Imagine a world in which ""the forgiving air"" has decided NOT to forgive our trespasses, a world in which ""The End of Nature"" has arrived. Imagine a world in which the average soccer mom and dad don't particularly care that the ozone layer is gone. Imagine a post-apocalyptic suburban California where life goes on, albeit expensively and with ever diminishing quality, because the majority of the hopelessly bourgeois population still operates under paradigmatic assumption that ""civilization"" and ""nature"" are dichotomous spaces, and can be as decoupled in practice as they are in theory.
 Into this world come two passionate, renegade environmental scientists and their teenage son, the former with a vision of completely and anthropogenically integrating wilderness, agriculture and domestic suburban life before it's too late, the latter with an abiding hatred of environmentalism and the desire to ""just fit in"" to his new high school, where bullies intimidate anybody who seems ""nerdy"" by threatening to expose them to the deadly sun.
This is the world of ""Habitat"", Monday night's avant-garde speculative fiction film about an environmentally dysfunctional future and the extraordinary reactions of ordinary people within it.  The fun begins when the scientists, fed up with bake sales and barbecues in full protective gear, start considering other, post-modern epistemological methodologies in their search for a bio-technological solution to the problems of food production in the post-ozone full-on greenhouse-gas afflicted world.
Showtime:  7 p.m.  Room 4573, Immediately following  the Environmentalism, Past Present and Future Class.
 Professor Susannah Hecht will provide commentary and answer questions after the film.

""Marvelous - it really made me marvel.  Honest!""
""Stimulating! - it was as if acetylcholine was constantly crossing my synaptic junctions as I watched!
""Irresistible --  I found it very hard to resist!""
""Great! - much bigger and more important than smaller, less important films!""
""A winner - it's as if this film could beat other films with which it is in competition...""
""A tour de force - it kind of moves about with a certain energy in a very french way...""",980294400,2,2721,5.591240875912408
955973,1,6305065624,"When I saw Habitat in the video store, I thought, ""Y'know, that might seem like a good T&A flick.""  I was wrong.  What little T&A they showed was good, but other than that, this movie really sucked.  The  acting just made you want to say, ""Okay, whatever.""  This movie  was more like a bad acid trip or a corny dream than a Sci-Fi flick.  In  fact, I was really tempted to just push the stop button and end it, but no,  I had to finish it.  So please, stay away from this movie.  If you see it  in a video store and think it may be a good T&A flick, then just skip  it and go to the porn section.",917654400,4,596,3.8666666666666667

7881507,5,6305065624,This was a movie I have been looking for on DVD for years!  So glad they finally put it out.  Interesting little gem.  Not your usual scifi/horror flick.  Enjoy!,1437523200,,161,4.448275862068965

7881510,5,6305065624,"It`s good if you like a little nudity, I myself don`t mind if it`s got a good plot! It makes you think what would happen if we accually did lose the ozone layer??",1357344000,,162,3.9393939393939394
7881511,3,6305065624,"I love the premise of the movie, that the earth is changing s mankind must change too.  There will always be those that are scared of change, and what they don't understand they want to destroy.  The acting is quite cheesy, the scenery is nicely put together, but overall the effects are well made.

The sound was awful, the music was too loud to hear what the actors were saying, the menu was complicated, unlike anything I have ever seen, there was no control for audio or for subtitles, there was only a main screen and scene selections.  I gave this movie a 3 for the terrible audio, but the color and scenery were outstanding.",1278720000,2,631,4.460869565217391
7881512,5,6305065624,"Habitat was a really bizarre movie indeed but there were some moments that are worth a look for some people: the film's CGI effects were interesting, you also got two attractive women showing off their bodies, Alice Krige and Laura Harris (check out the pond scene in the movie, pretty exotic). The insides of the house when it becomes infested with plants was by the far the special effects of the movie itself, and it was really cool and bizarre. Overall, this movie is fantastic and is worth a look indeed. The only gripe I have is the DVD release. The film's special effects would look fantastic on Blu-Ray. IMDb claims that the movie was shot in HD quality and it partly shows on DVD. Blu-Ray would do this movie justice.",1278460800,2,726,4.549618320610687
7881513,3,6305065624,"Yes, it's finally happened. We've wiped out the ozone layer, causing the earth to become a scorched, blasted wasteland. Thankfully, mankind has adjusted by wearing funny hats and carrying umbrellas around. Meanwhile, a scientist named Hank Symes (Tcheky karyo) is working on a solution through strange botanical experiments. He is developing plants and fungi that could replenish the planet. One such experiment has already led to death and destruction, forcing Symes, his wife (Alice Krige from Ghost Story, Star Trek: First Contact, and Sleepwalkers), and their teenage son (Balthazar Getty from Feast) to relocate to the small town of Pleasanton, USA. They've barely settled in before dad starts his wild experiments again, leading to an accident. Symes is turned into a cloud of flying, sentient spores, and the new homestead mutates into a jungle full of unheard of plant species'! This all sounds fascinating, but the execution is a bit clunky and the cheeze is quite pungeant at times, especially when we are introduced to young Symes' highschool, and the movie takes a turn toward KARATE KID-land. Teen-Symes is surrounded by homicidal jock types in his gym class. His coach is a sadistic, brain-free neanderthal. All of these idiots conspire to make this kid's life miserable (and shorter). Back at home, the house's interior is now a tropical paradise for mum to wander through. Of course, the town fascists can't just leave well enough alone, and soon plot the annihilation of all things green. This leads to a final that isn't very breathtaking. HABITAT has it's moments, but not many. Alice Krige is as eerily alluring as ever, and even sheds her clothing! Laura Harris follows suit! Still, there's something missing from this story. Tension? Mystery? Suspense?? Perhaps all three...",1210636800,3,1796,5.196551724137931

Gives a take on the environment and how nature can take control of humans.

Very enjoyable in very weird sort of way!

7881515,2,6305065624,"It amazes me that so many reviewers rate a movie on how much T&A and/or nudity there is.  If it's not relevant to the plot, it's merely padding for a usually dull movie.  Alice Krige is a beautiful woman, and a mesmerizing actress.  However, Alice is lost in this ludicrously staged movie.  Also, why do they constantly get actors with thick accents (like Tcheky Karyo) to reveal important plot points.  You need to turn on your subtitles just to see what they're saying.

Balthazar Getty is very ineffective in his leading role, not much better than a high school thespian in their first role; Laura Harris (The Calling) is okay in her first role, but she's not really given that much to do; Kenneth Welsh tries to act like Vincent Price in his role as the coach, but can't achieve the flashy overacting he so obviously intended; Brad Austin as the somewhat studly Blaine comes on like a young Travolta, but can't match the intensity; the special effects which basically consist of a bunch of flashing dots is mundane.  The plot about the ultimate evolution is so incoherent, it doesn't truly make sense, and the ending is flat.

Not the classic some people suggest; merely a waste of time.",1094256000,2,1191,4.6650717703349285
