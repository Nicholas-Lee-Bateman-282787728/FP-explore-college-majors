8333175,3,B001PF5D6K,"This dvd would not play on my TV's but would play on a PC. The video provides a very good tour of the city ruins of Ephesus,Pergamon and Sardis. The naration is good, but video quality is poor. Still, for those who wish to view these historic cities, you will see the sites and some items from the local museums as well as the current local inhabited surroundings.",1352419200,,364,4.367647058823529
