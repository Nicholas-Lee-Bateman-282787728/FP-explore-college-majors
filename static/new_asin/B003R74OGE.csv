8403323,3,B003R74OGE,"$5; Shemp Howard; and Billy Gilbert, THAT is about all you need to know.
This one of the ""Alpha Video"" series that don't offer the best quality audio/
video, but, for what they're askin' for it, you certainly get your money's worth.",1524528000,,232,4.5476190476190474
8403324,4,B003R74OGE,"OK 1940's comedy/mystery involving an old spooky house, a young heiress, her sinister relatives and hanger-on's, and a trio of carnival workers and their gorilla.  Shemp Howard and Billy Gilbert play two of the carnys.  At times rather amusing. I ordered my DVD-R copy from Movies Unlimited.  The quality is not great, obviously from a poor grade master.  I hope a re-mastered, cleaned up version is released soon.",1395446400,4,414,5.044117647058823
