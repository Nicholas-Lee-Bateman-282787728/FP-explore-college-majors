1360542,4,B00004W21U,"A terrific performance by Tom Baker. Dr. Who arrives unannounced on Gallifrey and claims his title as Lord President of the Time Lords. He moves so swiftly that no one challenges him and he is sworn in. He then turns around and invites the Vardens, an alien race that can travel along EM waves, to take over Gallifrey. He banished Leela and appoints a toady sycophant as Vice -president. A civil war erupts between the Time Lords, with Leela leading the revolt. Dr. Who creates a hole in the force field around Gallifrey for the Vardens to bring their invasion fleet.
Dr. Who learns of the Vardens home planet and traps it in a time loop, freeing Gallifrey and becoming the hero.
Suddenly, THe Sontarans appear, wrecking havoc. During the battle, Dr. WHo creates the most powerful weapon in the universe to destroy the Sontarans. He succeeds in turning the invasion and promptly forgets everything. Leela decides to stay on Gallifrey with Ardend, and K-9 stays to look after the mistress.
It is a satisfying adventure but it does leave many questions and possibilities unanswered. Tom Baker is superb as the manipulating Dr. Who, playing everyone against each other in order to destroy the Vardens and Sontarans. The violence is high as several people die that Dr. Who should have been able to save but in war etc...Gallifrey is depicted as 2 distinct cultures, the Citadel, full of bureaucrats and self-important Time Lords and those who have dropped out, living on the outside at a primitive level. Full of possibilities never followed up and the outsiders are never mentioned again in later episodes.
Leela's departure is abrupt and unexpected, with no hint until the end.
The last episode drags in places.
 It is worth getting",1025481600,10,1730,4.864406779661017
1360543,3,B00004W21U,"This is perhaps the most maligned of the Tom Baker - Louise Jameson Dr. Who episodes and the justification is aptly deserved: Jameson's Leela, my personal favorite of all the Doctor's companions, makes a major whimp-out of an exit from the series in a scene that was arrived at, not written. Reportedly, Jameson decided during the production to have it be her farewell episode but the director apparently failed to consult the scriptwriters before the cast and crew shot the passage where she and the Doctor part ways, and it's abrupt ineffectiveness mars and distracts from what otherwise is a quite satisfactory -- if overlong -- adventure. The Doctor brings Leela to Gallifrey where he brusquely stakes his claim as Lord President of the Time Lords, then inexplicably has her banished from the Citadel to what appears to be a sand pit by a drainage ditch. Meanwhile, the Doctor and K9 embark on a plan to ensare the Vardans, shimmering Alien Menace creatures depicted as bits of wrinkled cellophane with a light reflecting off of them, who have designs upon the Time Lords that Baker's Who never seemed to have bothered asking about. So all of a sudden there is civil war in the Citadel as some side with the Invaders and another sect sides behind the unremittingly dull Commander Andred, the swine that will end up winning Leela's heart during romantic scenes that are never shown. Why? Because the plot is too busy having the Sontarrens pop up out of nowhere, claiming that the Vardens were just their pawns [you following this?] and that they are there to achieve victory over Time itself. Uh-huh. I wouldn't have had a problem with any of this if the all important question of just when did Leela and Andred hook up? was answered. In fact, she spends the majority of the adventure running around with the pretty but aloof Rodan [that's right, the same name as the giant  rubbery Japanese space monster] and acting tough in front of the local outcast Time Lords who live in the sand pit by the drainage ditch, subsisting on walnuts. All of that is so unnecessary but somewhat redeemed by what I look upon as a clever segment set inside of the Tardis where the Sontarrens stomp around and look menacing while our heroes get lost in the endless corridors and storage rooms, which all look suspicously the same. Much scorn has been levied against this part of the episode because it was shot on found locations rather than decorated movie sets, but I actually find it intruguing, demonstrating how the Tardis really is infinite in the space it contains and not all of it necessarily has to look like the control room. But all criticism with this episode has to boil down to Leela's exit and our displeasure with how offhandedly it is treated. Someone we have grown to respect and care for steps aside and says goodbye to shack up with the most boring man on Gallifrey for NO apparent reason, and I just don't buy it. Still, the installment is another tour-de-force for Baker as the Doctor, has some great scenes involving K9 [whom I usually find annoying, I must admit] and a delightfully slimy character in the person of Castellan Kellner. Overlong and overwrought and bittersweet because of the Leela cop-out, but still worthy, and a must-have for Jameson fans. It's not her fault. Recommended.",1007251200,4,3299,4.7574171029668415
1360544,2,B00004W21U,"One of Doctor Who's producers, the immortal John Nathan Turner, once complained that the problem with six-part Doctor Who serials is that they are really nothing more than a four-part story and a two-part story linked together.  (This was one of Turner's reasons for cutting out the six-part stories during his tenure as producer)
And ""The Invasion of Time"" is certainly one of the most damning examples of this trend in Who history.
The premise is interesting enough--the Doctor reutrns home to Gallifrey and demands to be made Lord President.  Once he assumes the role and is given access to the Matrix (not with Keanu Reeves, thank you!), he betrays Gallifrey and allows it to be invaded by a mystersious race known as the Vardans.  Why?  The Doctor has his reasons and before you know it, he's turned the tables on them. This seemingly interesting plot takes place over the course of the first four-episodes and then comes to a swift, convincing resolution. But just as you think it's over, the Sontarins shows up and we've got two episodes more to go that include a lot of running around corridors (the Doctor Who Olympic sport).
It's a shame really as the first four episodes are quite good--entertaining and interesting.  It's just the final two that are such a major disappointment turning a potential classic story into a mockery of all things Who.  Yes, the Vardans look cheap and some of the sets are a bit wobbly--but this is Doctor Who we're talking about here where great special effects aren't the name of the game. It's the story that matters most.
And here, the story gets lost along the way.",975888000,9,1609,4.749103942652329
1360545,5,B00004W21U,"In this episode the Doctor returns home to Gallifrey with Leela and K9. Unknown to the Time Lords , the Doctor is in league with aliens called  Vardans who take over Gallifrey. Leela flees Gallifrey and meets Time Lord  dropouts. The Doctor defeats the Vardans, but an old enemy is waiting to  take over, the Sontarans. Finally the Doctor defeats the Sontarans and his  memoory of being Time Lord President erased. Leela stays behind with a  member of the security guards on Gallifrey. Also the Original K9 stay with  his mistress. In the end the Doctor starts to build a replaceement for  K9. This episode is the end of season 15.

1360546,1,B00004W21U,"BBC Video did the sensible thing and released the best Dr Who adventures onto video first.  That was back in the eighties, and by now they're reduced to wringing every last drop out of the money-making machine by  dredging up the kinds of 'adventures' most fans of the series would rather  forget.
'Invasion of Time' could have been an epic.  The Doctor  apparently betrays his own people, we see his race in a state of moral and  social decline, there are interesting scenes demonstrating how a member of  a society dependant on technology becomes a fish out of water when out in  the wild.
But the whole thing is completely bodged.  The aliens are  pieces of tin foil, the acting is bland and it's all treated as a joke.  The arrival of the Sontarans sinks the story to even greater depths in two  episodes so obviously tacked on to what was originally a four-parter.  It's  somehow hard to take seriously Cockney-accented Sontarans wearing cardboard  helmets with cut-out eye-holes.  They were once a genuine threat, but are  here reduced to comedy stormtroopers, falling over and being easily  outwitted every few seconds.
A total waste of time.  Everyone involved in  the making of this mess ought to be ashamed.",963964800,7,1217,4.78743961352657
1360547,5,B00004W21U,"I think this was one of Tom Bakers' best Doctor who episode. The Sontarans are the best enemies in this episode. The Doctor meets up with Vardens, and conspires to invade Gallifrey, and Leela is ejected out to outer Galifrey.  The Doctor is elected as President of the high council.",963619200,7,282,4.64
1360548,4,B00004W21U,"This has always been my favourite of The Dr. Who series. Finding out that it was coming to video was very exciting, and I anticipated its release with much vigor.
Tom Baker really shows his ability to play dual-natured  characters--a considered mark up, in reference to his already excellent  portrayal of the hobo time lord. In the start of the show, as he arrives on  his home planet, you believe he is there to hand it over to a trio of power  hungry alien beings, who are going to pay him very much. Then, you discover  it was a set up, to defeat these aliens.
The plot is quilt of secrets,  characters, powers in conflict; and diverse, settings of intrigue. The  discovery of an all powerful weapon of Rassilon, the invasion of the  Sontaruns and the betrayal of the High Council are just some of the  interesting twists which keep the plot fresh, alive and exciting until the  final moments, when the doctor says goodbye to an old friend.
Saving his  home planet, the same planet that cast him off, exiled, imprisoned him on  earth and constantly pressured him into doing their dirty work, showed the  great goodness the doctor was capable of.
Buy this one. The Invasion of  Time is one of the best Dr. Who videos, and it is the start of a great set  of seasons: The Key to Time and The E-Space Trilogy.",963360000,11,1309,4.4641350210970465

1360584,4,B00004W21U,"There are two big problems I have with this story. One is the rubbish exit for Leela in a way that makes no sense at all. The second is the awful redesign of the Sontarans.

Beyond that, the final serial of Season 15 has a lot going for it. Tom Baker flexes his acting muscles as the Fourth Doctor appears to have gone megalomaniacal and it's a great mystery as to what the Doctor is up to. Part Six really explore the TARDIS interior. While this wasn't particularly imaginative (as the TARDIS interior looks a lot like a school gym), it does impress the idea of the TARDIS as bigger on the inside. Overall, the plot flows well and the story is quite fun even if it's flawed.",1411948800,,675,4.2734375
1360585,3,B00004W21U,"I have always found this episode a bit irritating.  How the relatively technically backwards Sontarans could challenge the Time Lord's power was a stretch.  The episode wasn't in character for the Sontarans and it seemed odd that dismantling all Gallifreyan defences was the Doctor's response.  Even if they could read minds, the transduction barrier would be unbreakable.",1409702400,,372,5.491228070175438

1360587,5,B00004W21U,"This excellent Fourth Doctor story takes us to Gallifrey, where we see something of Time Lord society and intrigue. The Doctor, Leela and K-9 are off to the Time Lord's home world where the Doctor has to outwit an unusual mind-reading menace that wants to sieze control of Gallifrey and all of the Time Lord's power and technology. The Doctor has to ascend to the position of The Lord President of the Council of Time Lords in order to have the power to achieve his goal of saving his home world from invasion. This serial introduces us to many aspects of Time Lord society in and outside of the Citadel. Not all of the foes are alien, as treachery exists in certain powerful Time Lords as well. I particularly liked the Time Lady Rodan who shows that Time Lords of both sexes can be valiant. One weaker aspect of the serial was the departure of Leela, which seemed pretty tacked on to the ending of the last episode. There certainly wasn't a good lead-up to make her reasons fully believable.

1360602,5,B00004W21U,"The Tom Baker era epsidoe entitled ""The Invasion of Time"" has the Doctor dealing with some unkown alien force that is determine to conquer Gallifrey and place the Time Lords and all there power under thier control. However the Doctor has kept Leela out of the loop and is treating her verry badly.  Even going so far as to intruct K-9 to stun her if she tries to activate the TARDIS screen to see outside.
  Once landing in Galliefry's standard time the Doctor is greeted by guards prepared to take him and Leela to the Castelan.  On the way they pass Chancellor Barusa old freind and teacher of the Doctor and there the Doctor before him claims the titles, rights and privlages befitting the Lord President.  Leela is shcoked and even Barusa is surprised since he fled before he could take the mantle and with it left a gap at the highest level of thier power.
  Meanwhile the Doctor is being monitored by the aliens he is working with and waiting, but for what and when will the strike?  Leela is being prepared for the ceremony that will allow the Doctor to become Lord Preisdent.  And being watched by the captain of the guard so she doesn't try to escape or flee the citadel.
  Many of the Time Lords are aghast that the Doctor is demanding the induction so soon and not following proper protocol.  Barusa is also perpelxed by why the Doctor has returned and wonders if something else is going on.  The Doctor prepared begins to recite the oath as Lord President and given the trappings of office with the Sash of Rassilon and the Secpter of Rassilon. Even so much as given the Key to Rassillon only to discover that no President has ever found in there time.  For they and they alone must search for it.  The aliens fear that the key is lost and without there plans will not work.  With the final oath spoken and the crown of Rassilon placed upon his borw he then takes in all of the inforamtion and power of the Matrix the single greatest computer the universe has ever seen. (And you don't get 42 as an answer.) The Matrix overpowers him and soon chaos ensues.  The Castellan has taken over and Barusa and the other Time Lords are placed under arrest until such time that it can be determined what happen to the Doctor.
  Meanwhile the Doctor recovers but orders Leela to be exiled out into the wastelands for her own good. Barusa is forced to obey the Doctor no matter what and worse still it seems the aliens are preparing  for invasion and using pshyic powers they try to destroy the force wall protecting the planet.  With the Doctor acting strange, Leela exiled and the Time Lords being forced to obey alien invaders will they surivie? And what does the fabled Key of Rassilon have to do with all of this?

1360603,3,B00004W21U,"The story is pretty good, although far too long, but the visuals are bottom of the barrel even by Who standards.  Aside from the tin-foil Vardans we finally get a trip deep inside the TARDIS and find that it's just an abandoned grimy hospital building.

This is also the first Graham Williams season so the good vibes of the Hinchcliffe/Holmes era are really starting to wear off. The stories are getting flabbier, Baker is going more over-the-top and production values are taking a tumble. The three most effective stories of the season (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Horror-of-Fang-Rock-Story-92-Doctor-Who-Image-of-the-Fendahl-Story-94/dp/B0009PVZFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Horror of Fang Rock (Story 92)],  [Doctor Who: Image of the Fendahl (Story 94)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Sun-Makers-Story-95/dp/B001QCWQ62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Sun Makers (Story 95)</a>&nbsp;) came early on when Robert Holmes was still script editor.  You also have the introduction of the kid-friendly K-9 which was definitely a step backward for Who.

The most glaring defect of the story is the way in which Leela is so shoddily written out of the series. Louise Jameson had wanted Leela to die fighting, which would have suited her character.  Instead it was decided that she would suddenly marry a character that she barely knew and settle down on Gallifrey. Pretty lame. On the plus side it is fun to see the 'evil' Doctor for a couple of episodes. As a fan I also like the glimpses of Time Lord society although, in retrospect, it was probably a mistake for the show to strip away so much of the Time Lord mystique and show them as a bunch of petty squabblers. They certainly no longer come across as the powerful 'guiding hand' which we saw in the Troughton, Pertwee and the earliest Baker stories.",1286409600,,1948,5.793706293706293
1360604,5,B00004W21U,"I hold this one up to be one of my favorite Tom Baker stories of all time along with ""The Ark in Space"", ""Genesis of the Daleks"", and ""Planet of Evil"", and if I could choose just one story from the Tom Baker era to sum up his Doctor, then this one would have to be it. The only thing that's missing from this story is a hammer horror feel to it. But other than that, this one's got everything. It has a great script with interesting plot twists at every turn. You've got lots of mystery and action with some great humorous moments in this one. Two alien races are invading Gallifrey - the Vardans and the Sontarans. Performances are great. Tom Bkaer's Doctor is as good as ever as he is featured eating and offering everybody jelly babies in this one. For the first half of the story the Doctor appears to be a traitor by helping these alien beings invade his own world and he even turns against his own companion, Leela, in this one. And when the truth is finally revealed, the Doctor is never more heroic. K9 stands by the Doctor's side throughout the whole thing, and he is certainly a dog of action when you see him battling Sontarans with his laser nose. This is definitely a five star script.

And although the production suffers a little bit due to the fact that the BBC was having money troubles then and suffering from a strike, the story is so good you are able to forgive this story for it. Plus the new CGI effects included on this DVD also greatly improve the story - although I think I like the original shot of Gallifrey better than the new CGI shot, but other than that, the new effects are a lot better. The story is great, and is highly recommended!",1239148800,,1667,4.292063492063492
1360605,2,B00004W21U,"Primitive special effects, tacky production values and location shooting that turns the English countryside or derelict buildings into sci-fi settings have always been a big part of the charm of Doctor Who. The story and characters have to be compelling when the show so often looks as if it were pulled out of the BBC's backside.

""The Invasion of Time,"" however, was not one of those creative stories. It was a fair to middling production from one of the Fourth Doctor's more fallow periods, and it simply doesn't warrant the two-disc treatment it receives here. Yes, it is a six-parter, but the extra features clock in at well under an hour. ""The Sea Devils,"" released on DVD three months previously, manages to squeeze six episodes, almost an hour of extras, plus a 120-page book in PDF format, all onto one disc. So disc capacity certainly wasn't an issue.

""The Invasion of Time"" was the final story before the ""Key to Time"" season and marked Louise Jameson's last outing as Leela, but it all feels haphazard from start to finish. The story recycles sets and costumes from the previous season's ""The Deadly Assassin."" The special effects depicting the unseen invaders are laughably bad even by Doctor Who standards. The story is structured as a four-parter but tacks on a two-episode ""dog leg"" featuring a ""surprise"" appearance by the Sontarans, one of the easier aliens for the show to produce.

The padding in these last two episodes is shameless: Characters chase each other through the same scenery over and over and over, and we're told it's because they're walking through different, identical levels of the TARDIS. Yeah, right. You'd think the producers would at least try to put a little razzle-dazzle into such a rare, insider's tour of the Doctor's fabled time machine. Instead, the scenes were shot inside a decommissioned mental hospital--and they look it.

This was clearly not one of Tom Baker's finest hours (or two) as the good Doctor and is recommended for completists only. Casual fans of the Fourth Doctor will want to invest their hard-earned cash in ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang"" or ""City of Death.""",1232064000,8,2124,4.924581005586592
1360606,5,B00004W21U,"Tom Baker is my all-time favorite Doctor. This is my favorite episode of his. It is a classic and one of the few Gallifrey episodes. If you are a die-hard fan, this is a must see!",1230163200,,179,4.0
1360607,5,B00004W21U,"""The Invasion of Time"" was one of the first ""Doctor Who"" stories I encountered, at a very young age, thanks to the novelization (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-and-the-Invasion-of-Time/dp/0426200934/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who and the Invasion of Time</a>) by Terrance Dicks.  I thus lack any objectivity towards this story.  I've read the book, and later seen the TV episode, so often that I know every line by heart and could assemble the script like a jigsaw puzzle even with the lights off.  It wouldn't make any sense to me now, nearly 25 years later, to question where the pieces are supposed to go.  If offered the script to improve, I couldn't change it.

Plot-wise, it's best to think of ""Invasion"" as three successive two-part adventures.  In the opening two acts, the Doctor has seemingly turned evil -- assuming dictatorial control of his home planet (Gallifrey, last seen in the wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Deadly-Assassin/dp/6301802748/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Deadly Assassin</a>) and opening the floodgates to alien invaders.  This is Tom Baker at his manic best.  In the middle story, the camera pulls back to reveal the Doctor's been on our side the whole time, as he enlists the help of an enormous cast to defeat the threat -- until the camera pulls back yet again to reveal that the Doctor's been duped by the Sontarans (last seen in the much less impressive&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Sontaran-Experiment-Episode-77/dp/B000KGGIRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Sontaran Experiment (Episode 77)</a>) and has to journey deep into the rarely-seen heart of his own TARDIS to save the day in Parts Five and Six.

The DVD production team's editorial slant towards ""Invasion"" is roughly similar to mine.  Via the stellar production note subtitle feature during the main story, and on the too-brief making-of featurette, they reveal a fondness for the big ideas and concepts that underlie the story -- even if the production values got caught up and trampled in the rush to make the Big Epic Season Finale on a less-than-shoestring budget.

I learned a lot about ""Invasion"" from the DVD, in fact, much more than I thought I'd be able to learn from a story whose twists and turns I've worn smoothe through years of re-use.  The script, for example, was a last-minute filler replacement written in four days.  Who knew?  Or that the production was hastily mounted on location in a disused hospital, or that companion Leela (Louise Jameson)'s departure from the series was something the producer hoped to reverse at the very last minute.

The commentary track here is a little dull; we've already heard from Jameson, John Leeson (the voice of K-9, who occasionally slips into character), and FX man Mat Irvine on this month's companion release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Invisible-Enemy-K9-and-Company-A-Girl-s-Best-Friend/dp/B001AGXEBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Invisible Enemy/K9 and Company: A Girl's Best Friend</a>.  Co-author Anthony Read is a welcome addition to the booth, although he doesn't really add much until the final hour.  Six minutes of deleted scenes are quite welcome -- we don't get these too often.  A comedy reel on the story's pseudonymous author, ""David Agnew"", gets its few chuckles, while a short bit on the Doctor's since-defunct home planet Gallifrey feels oddly rushed.

While the visual effects don't hold up so well after 30+ years, the CGI overlay added by the restoration team offers one nice benefit: the Vardans now appear as menacing humanoid ghosts rather than as rattling drapes of tin foil, if you choose that option.  Of course, the effects don't matter much, not with a large well-acted cast and a script full of such large ideas.  Here's another case of ""Doctor Who"" doing something with next to nothing, and more than getting away with it.",1227398400,11,4102,5.735973597359736

1360619,4,B00004W21U,Very enjoyable story. Has our beloved Doctor turned evil and sold out Gallifrey to alien invaders? Tom Baker's acting is top notch. My only complaint about the story is Leela's romance with a Gallifreyian soldier is not very believable-no chemistry between them at all. I highly recommend this episode to other Dr. Who fans.,1223164800,3,324,5.018518518518518
1360620,4,B00004W21U,"Time was one luxury that those involved in the making of ""The Invasion of Time"" had none of. After receiving an utterly unworkable script soon before things were supposed to get started, the producer and script editor had to team up and dash this one off at the last minute, making sure to incorporate only pre-existing sets and costumes since barely any leeway existed for crafting new ones. As if that weren't enough, filming had to be hurriedly scheduled so as to avoid inevitable strikes at the BBC looming on the horizon. Everything seems to have been working against them, in short, and yet somehow they pulled off one of the more unusually intriguing and unique Doctor Who stories of the 1970's.

How? Partly by making a virtue of necessity. The story returns us once again to the Doctor's home world of Gallifrey (for which sets and costumes still remained from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Deadly-Assassin-Episode-88/dp/B001QCWQ58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Deadly Assassin (Episode 88)</a>), a rather tedious and drearily bureaucratic place enlivened only by petty political maneuvering and backstabbing, a society resting on its laurels after having achieved all it could ever achieve ages beforehand. Into this bland uneventfulness come the Doctor and his knife-wielding companion Leela, throwing everyone for a loop--including the viewer, as the Doctor begins to act more and more erratically, more and more like the very type of power-mad dictator he usually fights against. Tom Baker pulls this off with superb finesse, giggling (for instance) with wickedly barking mad glee as he supposedly introduces his fellow Time Lords to their conquerors, his apparent accomplices the Vardans. The writers keep us going for quite a while, too, finally revealing only rather late into the story that this is all but a risky yet clever stratagem on the Doctor's part to hoodwink the Vardans and save the day, expertly timing this revelation just exactly before the moment our confusion would've shifted into active dislike for our erstwhile hero.

Still, for all that, the strain shows. The concept behind the Vardans' threatening power--the ability to travel instantly along any wavelength, including that of thought--is as highly original as it is indeed formidable, but the less than special effect used to depict them (rattling tin foil superimposed onto the screen) is so dismal as to be distracting even to longtime fans tolerant of the show's chronic shortcomings in this area. Their humanoid form is not much more impressive, and then in an uncomfortable moment of anticlimax intended apparently to keep the story going for another two episodes at all costs, the Sontarans replace the Vardans with little real rhyme or reason. Don't get me wrong, the Sontarans are great, but this isn't their gig (shouldn't they be busy with the Rutans?), and limited physical beings with conventional space weaponry that they are, they seem much less a threat to the Time Lords than the prior Vardans. Second of all and in a similar vein, the frankly ingenious idea of having a chase through endless labyrinths within the Doctor's dimensionally transcendental vehicle the Tardis is sadly let down by actuality, it being painfully obvious that these are just old musty hallways in some building in England (a defunct mental hospital, as it turns out). Finally, Leela is swiftly and abruptly written out at the conclusion in an implausibly ridiculous manner glaringly inconsistent with her character--a particularly deplorable lapse for me, Leela being one of my favorite companions.

Given the circumstances, though, these problems are less surprising than the fact that it all ultimately beats the odds and holds together pretty dang well as an interesting and thoroughly enjoyable Doctor Who adventure. Some very memorable supporting characters contribute a lot to this success, including the Doctor's old mentor Borusa, venerable and yet foxily savvy, and the obsequiously scheming Castellan. On a larger scale, there is just something dreadfully compelling about the idea of an advanced society presuming itself invulnerable and so being taken off guard, and the unseemly politics of occupation are portrayed as convincingly as possible given the show's format. Finally, some of the off-the-wall oddball humor considered so typical of the Fourth Doctor really comes to the fore here, including a daring though momentary aside to the audience. Probably no other show could get away with this and still count as good solid serious science fiction, and on that strength alone ""The Invasion of Time"" manages as a fine example of classic Doctor Who, not to mention grace under pressure.",1221177600,11,4757,5.373994638069705

However, any fan of the series would be very hard pressed not to love this episode.  This is pure, unbridled Doctor Who. This one is chock full of twists and turns and the appearnce of an old foe really blindsides you!  Well acted, with some fabulous chemistry between the actors, especially the Doctor and the Cardinal.  the whole thing leaves you with a feeling of mixed emotion of course, as the bad guys get it in the end, but we lose a Tardis companion.  The possibilities of what actually happned to this companion are limitless, and have never been explored, and of course with the new series, anything is possible!!!  This really is Tom Baker at his erratic best doing what he does best!",1220400000,5,797,4.5
1360623,5,B00004W21U,"The premise of ""THE INVASION OF TIME"" is simple, but genius: WHAT IF... the Doctor became EVIL? ""Invasion"" is a sequel of sorts to the Doctor's last visit to his homeworld of Gallifrey in ""Deadly Assassin"" in which the Doctor saves the Timelords from the Master and in doing so becomes the sole surviving candidate in an election to determine the Timelord Presidency.  The story opens with the Doctor apparently selling out his people to anonymous alien invaders. The Doctor berates and expels  his companion, Leela and betrays his old Timelord mentor Borusa and before long succeeds in arranging the conquest of the planet. Once revealed, the invaders turn out to be B list, working for the Sontarans (as seen in  this season's DW series 4, the ""Sontaran Stratagem"").  The Sontaran want control over time itself, via the relics of the President's office and the help of the Lord President of the Timelords a.k.a The Doctor...Once the Doctor's plan is revealed things really get complicated...a rebellion against the traitorous Doctor is underway, ultimately leading up to a battle for Gallifrey, even including a ""unforgettable"" chase through the deep recesses of the Doctor's TARDIS.

Some of the best moments of the story include conversations between the overbearing Lord Doctor and Borusa, his teacher's current & most memorable incarnation played by John Arnatt. Tom Baker is in top form when he in his over-the-top megalomaniacal glory for the first half of the story. The climatic TARDIS chase is memorable, not for the execution, which isn't so good, but the sense of the transdimensional nature of the Doctor's craft. The scenes in the TARDIS really convey the limitlessness and spark the imagination for the possibilities in store for the new series, hopefully.  K9 mark I. and Leela say their farewells, but what's not so memorable, the unbelievable romance between the warrior woman Leela and the sheltered Captain of the Guard, Andred.  Equally forgettable are some effects on the second string invaders, the Vardans, worse than their horrible shroud images is their actual physical form in some sort of cross between a WWII paratrooper and a TV news cameraman. One major flaw of the finale of the 6 part story is having the Doctor solve the conflict with a gadget, especially when that gadget is for all intents and purposes a big gun! Even fans new to the series, know ""the Doctor just `ain't down with `dat!""

For all of it's script troubles, plot and FX flaws, Invasion is a must own for any Doctor Who fan, for it's many Timelord and Tardis milestones and because the Sontarans have just been revamped. Besides, this is history.

1360625,5,B00004W21U,"One of the most overlooked and under-appreciated stories but for the serious Doctor Who fan or even if you just started watching, it's great piece.  Tom Baker is at his best - a great display of his wit and slapstick style.  The dialogue and incidental music are well crafted.  An excellent supporting cast with great development of the supporting characters - Borusa, played by John Arnatt,  is the best of all 4 actors to play Borusa.  The Castellan is a subservient weasel, played wonderfully by Milton Johns.  The episode provides a deeper look into Timelord capital society but also has the fun ""chase"" scene through the TARDIS (which has a much more interesting look than in the Davidson era and beyond).  Additionally, this story really keeps you wondering, who are the ""good guys"" and who are the villains?  Even the Doctor is thrown into the mix!
This story got me hooked on Doctor Who nearly 20 years ago!!!!  Still my favorite and always will be!!!
PLEASE RELEASE ON DVD SOON!!!!!!!",1083974400,,993,4.794117647058823
1360626,5,B00004W21U,"The closing story of FDoctor Who's fifteenth season begins with the unthinkable.  The Doctor signs a contract with three unknown and unseen aliens in space.  He has ordered Leela inside the TARDIS.  When he comes in, she is bursting with questions.  The Doctor tells her to ask K9 to tell her to shut up.  When she starts to comply, she catches herself with an angry ""How dare you?""
His behaviour becomes more erratic.  He sees Borusa, his former teacher and now Chancellor, played with dry and acerbic aplomb by Leonard Arnatt, and arrogantly claims his birthright, demanding to become inaugurated president of the High Council of Time Lords.  The presidential investiture ceremony echoes that of a bishop or pope being sworn in.  And when he's told, ""I give you the Matrix,"" the network containing the sum total of knowledge and memories of dead Time Lords, I found myself thinking, ""Good thing it doesn't have Keanu Reeves in it.""
With the aliens fully in control, he then instigates a full-scale purge of Time Lords who could be construed as troublemakers to his regime, even ordering Leela banished into the ""barbaric garden"" of Outer Gallifrey.  He is aided in this by the Castellan Kelner, whose obsequious surface masks motives of self-preservation, as he is quick to switch allegiances.  Kudos to Milton Johns for his portrayal.
Like The Deadly Assassin, there's another incompetent Guard commander, Andred.  He's played by Christopher Tranchell, who previously appeared in the no-longer existent Who story The Faceless Ones.  However, he isn't as brutal as his predecessor.
The interior of the Doctor's TARDIS, and I'm not just talking about the control room is one of the best reasons to watch this story, as one finally gets the idea of dimensional transcendentalism.  The scene involving the storage room is reminiscent of Monty Python's deja vu sketch, giving it a surreal edge.  However, for a real design triumph, the Doctor's funky-looking presidential office is a masterpiece.
Along with the usual manic grins and jokes by the Doctor, there are two funny exchanges.  When the Doctor's bodyguard protests that he'll be shot by the Castellan for leaving his side, the Doctor responds with.  ""That's all right.  I'll have him [the Castellan] shot.""  Later, Andred tells him, ""You have access to the greatest source of knowledge in the universe.""  Doctor:  ""Well, I do talk to myself sometimes, yes.""  Andred:  ""I mean the Matrix.""  Doctor:  ""Oh, that old thing.""
The Invasion Of Time sees the farewell of two popular companions, and an unrewarding one on the part of Leela.  She really proves her mettle here, being the tough warrior, believing in the Doctor despite his odd behaviour, and overall, has been one of the most intrepid and fearless companions of the Doctor, yet she suffers the fate of companions Susan, Vicki, and Jo Grant.  WHY??  Her scenes with Rodan, a young Time Lord, not a gigantic double-crested barking pterodactyl from Toho Studios, are great.  Rodan seems to be a prototype for Romana I, who would be the Doctor's companion in the following season.  Hilary Ryan does a good job being the technically-skilled but sheltered counterpart to Leela's hardy experienced person.
This six-parter is one of the all-time classics, although it's probably best to first watch The Deadly Assassin, probably more classic than this story, in order to remember Gallifreyan institutions and Borusa.  The Invasion Of Time adds more information on Gallifrey.",1057536000,7,3479,5.084656084656085
1360627,3,B00004W21U,"The Doctor returns to Gallifrey and declares himself President, seems to be hell-bent on assisting a sinister alien takeover.  What follows is an intriguing look at the Time Lord society in decay.  The fact that the Doctor can stroll in and become president on a technicality shows flaws have developed in their legal system, and there are now bands of outsiders who have abandoned life in the cities and now live as savages.  Indeed, some of the best scenes are out in the wilds, a never-before-seen part of Gallifrey.  Tom Baker is good as an almost sinister Doctor, and his Presidential Office is an unusual design.  Though the first four episodes are sometimes a little on the slow side, if the story had finished at the end of Episode Four it would probably have been remembered as a fairly good adventure.  What really lets the story down is the contrived arrival of the Sontarans.  A far cry from Kevin Lindsay's intelligent warrior, these Sontarans are comedy stormtroopers.  They spend two pointless episodes blundering about the corridors of Gallifrey's city, and an abandoned hospital (?) which seems to exist inside the Tardis.  It's very tricky to take them seriously, especially as their leader has a cockney accent, and they have cardboard helmets with cut-out eye-holes that look like they were made for a school play.  This story might be worth a look if you're interested in Time Lord society, but fans of Sontarans would be better off tracking down 'Time Warrior' or 'Sontaran Experiment'.",1056844800,2,1508,4.924901185770751
1360628,2,B00004W21U,"A landmark Doctor Who episode only because it involves an in-depth look at Gallifrey, and marks Leela's (Louise Jameson) departure.  Also worth a look if you're a Tom Baker fan --he gives one of his most intense performances as the Doctor.  Following the events of the previous season's superior ""The Deadly Assassin,"" the Doctor returns to his homeworld to claim the Presidency on a technicality.  What then transpires is enough to keep everyone in the dark as to his real motives --by the end of Part 2 we're wondering if that power-mad dictator really IS the Doctor!
However, all of that aside, this episode is somewhat of a disappointment.  A six-part serial, it drags unbearably in some places, and breezes through the plot in others.  The Vardans are such an original idea on paper and in concept, but the way they are realized on screen is dreadful.  The Sontarans make a surprise entrance at the end of Part 4, but an entire squad of them is far less menacing than Kevin Lindsay's excellent solitary Sontaran of the earlier serials ""The Time Warrior"" or ""The Sontaran Experiment.""
A pity, because some of the performances in this episode are worth a look --Milton Johns excels as a toady subservient Castellan  and John Arnatt plays the best incarnation of Borusa in the entire series; his mischevious side really shines through, and there's a distinct sense of understanding just where the Doctor may have gotten some of his own wry sense of humor.  The low points of the episode are, as usual, the endless corridors of Gallifrey and the even more endless corridors of the TARDIS itself (shot very unconvincingly on location in a gasworks, of all places).  My personal favorite is the unique design of the Doctor's Presidential office with its lead relief work.

I'm really impressed with Tom Baker's characterization of the fourth Doctor, he is a well balanced conservative liberal or in other words he has Good Common Sense. This combined with sincere morality makes for an authentic role model, something quite rare and sorely needed.
The Invasion Of Time was hastily prepared and it does seem a little improvised.
It is a bit abstract but in a tangible, easy to understand way.
The ever expansive Tardis is innovative and entertaining. It seems as if it could be another world!
How much room does the Doctor need?
I do like the swimming pool, nice touch of absurdity.
I'm not sure about the Doctor and Andred (Chris Tranchell)  looking into the camera to address the viewer occasionally. A silly disruption.
This is also the final appearance of Leela (Louise Jameson).
She gives a strong and natural performance here but I am very disappointed the character has not grown or become more intelligent over time. Her departure is more of an afterthought than surprise.
The robot dog K-9 elects to stay with her for protection but after theTardis leaves we discover a still-in-the-box K-9 Mark II!
It's good to have a spare.
This is a somewhat dual story in a way, the bulk of it features a trio of aliens known as Vardans who are supplanted by Sontaran aliens which are much more menacing.

This is a very relevant entry for the Tom Baker era and it has a high fun quotient. It is stimulating enough to hold one's interest.
It does have fairly high production values, good sets and special effects, some of which have optional CGI enhancements that really aren't necessary.
