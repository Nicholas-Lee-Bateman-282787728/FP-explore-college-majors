If you look past the cheese, awful dubbing, and grindhouse editing, you'll usually find great fight scenes and a pretty good (often ridiculous but fun) story. I was thrilled to see Tien Hsiang Lung (Flag of Iron, Ten Tigers From Kwangtung) in Bruce vs. Snake In The Eagle's Shadow. Fist of Death (Bruce & Jackie To The Rescue) is big fun. In this Korean entry, a Bruce clone (Tang Lung from Game of Death I-III) battles and eventually teams with a Jackie Chan clone (Jackie Chang) who steals moves directly from Fearless Hyena and Drunken Master. Bruce against Supermen features Bruce Li in Kato garb and Chinese Gods brings The Little Dragon back in animated form. Heel duties in the films are carried out by some of the genre's finest including Chiang Tao, Lung Fei, and Bolo Yeung (Yang Sze). I wanted to give this 10 flick package 5 stars and show it to all of my friends but the picture quality of most of these films sucks. With Dragon Dynasty and others remastering countless classics, VideoAsia should be too ashamed to put these straight from VHS copies out on the market. I love the films but it's impossible to ignore constant jumps, freezes, blurs, and lines running across the screen. The fans deserve better. Remastered edition....Please?",1247356800,4,1300,4.808035714285714
8296101,5,B001E1MBME,"This is all BL clones including the film Clones of BL.
Bruce Li,Dragon Lee,Bruce Le and some I never heard of before.
Some of the films are biography and others are just crazy like Bruce vs. Supermen with Bruce Li as Kato.
Theres an animated film with Bruce Lee too.
If you are into this type of action then get it for sure.
The price is good and the films are not bad.
If you're into just BL then skip it.",1237766400,4,406,4.0246913580246915
8296102,5,B001E1MBME,"The passing of legendary martial arts master Bruce Lee was untimely and tragic--this film set pays homage to the man who immortalized Martial Arts in cinema. Ten films feature other gifted martial arts masters, Bruce Lee followers and impersonators, showcasing the influence that Lee had on MA culture. Each of the films has something unique to offer, from secret ninja missions to fighting off clones. If you are into martial arts or ninja films, you have to add this into your collection.",1233187200,4,490,4.987804878048781
