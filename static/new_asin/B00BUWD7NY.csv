8574292,1,B00BUWD7NY,Listen I hate dubbed films. I can handle subtitles and in fact like many foreign films. This is a dubbed movie. You will hear English but the mouths don't go with what they are saying. I was excited to see this film but now am just angry I paid for an altered product. Buyer Beware.,1440288000,,282,4.1454545454545455

DVD came on time and in great condition!  Thank you for a super item!",1400198400,,203,4.342105263157895
8574294,4,B00BUWD7NY,"This 4 movie horror pack from Mill Creek Entertainment is a little different from their other offerings, as it offers 2 German films and 1 Asian film. The April Fools Day remake is the odd film out in this set, but still fits the horror theme of the set. I used to own the 3 foreign films individually before I bought this set, so I was familiar with the bonus features, subtitles and dubbing. ""Anatomy"" on this set is English dubbed, just like its' individual counterpart. ""Anatomy 2"" has English subtitles only, also the same as its' single disc version. (This frustrates me, as some other films have done this too. The first part has the option of dubbed English or subtitles, then the sequel is subtitles only. I believe ""Frit Vilt"" is exactly the same way. Call me lazy, but if I see the first film is dubbed, I expect the sequels to be as well. either offer dubbing & subtitles on the films, or one or the other for both, don't mix them up. end of rant.)Then comes ""Double Vision"". The version I used to own had the option of spoken English, or Mandarin with English subtitles. Like I said before, being a lazy movie watcher, I would choose the English (also because there is a mixed Asian & American cast, and I wanted to hear the American actors in their real voices.) I don't like the fact that Mill Creek only offers this film with the Mandarin language with English subtitles. Was this a conscious choice by the company? Were they only allowed the film master with the foreign language? Am I just being too picky? I don't think so, when the English language was offered before on the individual release. So a heads up to buyers;if you want to see the English language version of ""Double Vision"" you can, just not on this set. Do a search, and find the Sony DVD version and you'll be all set.

This is a good set to pick up. I just wish that they would have included the English track on ""Double Vision."" Again, there could have been problems securing that print that I don't know about. All of the film prints are excellent, and Mill Creek continues to give the customers what they want at a price that they can afford.",1375833600,2,5269,4.9112359550561795

8574296,3,B00BUWD7NY,"One of my favorite movies from my childhood was the 1986 horror comedy April Fool's Day. I was unaware that there was a direct-to-DVD remake released in 2008, but I recently watched it in the 4 Movie Collection: Anatomy/ Anatomy 2/ Double Vision/ April Fool's Day from Mill Creek Entertainment, which I received free of charge in exchange for my honest review.

April Fool's Day (2008) stars Josh Henderson (TNT's Dallas) and Scout Taylor Compton (Rob Zombie's Halloween I & II) and it barely resembles the original as it drops most the fun and turns it into a slow contemporized slasher film. The plot rip-offs other horror movies: A year after a prank goes wrong at the annual April Fool's Day party, the Cartier siblings and their friends are being tormented by a crazed killer. There are a few twists and turns leading to an offbeat ending. Despite its unoriginal plot, it is still better than the other pointless remakes, like Prom Night.

Double Vision stars David Morse and Tony Leung Ka-fai in this Chinese thriller, which contains mostly English subtitles. Huang Huo-tu has lost the respect of his friends and co-workers. His young daughter is mentally ill, due to being in a hostage situation, and his wife is filing for divorce. He takes a job as a Foreign Affairs Officer, where he teams up with FBI agent Kevin Richter to try to solve a string of bizarre murders, all which lead them to suspect that some kind of supernatural force is involved in the killings. I have seen many horror movies, but this movie is strange. Running at nearly two hours, the pacing was a little slow for me, though I did end up liking it.

Franka Potente plays a medical student, Paula, in the German thriller Anatomy. She has been accepted into a prestigious anatomy class, but almost as soon as she arrives, her classmates are turning up in the morgue, which all of them died of bizarre deaths. Paula suspects fowl play and begins her own investigation that leads her to uncover the secret society known as the Anti-Hippocratic Society. This movie is English-dubbed, which is almost laughable at times as the voices don't match the characters at all. The plot is original, though the violence reminds me of Saw (which came out a few years later), but the third act falls into the typical slasher clich.

Anatomy 2 is set at the Berlin research department at a famous hospital, where Joachim Hauser has been accepted to complete his practical courses. His father had died from Muscular Dystrophy, which has also crippled his brother. Jo gets into Mueller LaRousse's top secret research group. The group experiments with different drugs and procedures that would be banned anywhere else. Jo wants a cure for his brother and volunteers to be a guinea pig for the procedures. Suddenly, a few of his classmates die. Paula Henning (from the first movie) is now a police investigator and she believes the deaths are connected to the Anti-Hippocratic Society. Unlike the first movie, the sequel has English subtitles instead of being dubbed. Some sequels tend to be copycats of the first, but the plot here is original as it gets, though it is a little weird.

There are no bonus features on this two-disc set. The picture quality comes in great. Though these films aren't perfect, I still enjoyed watching them.",1368489600,,3297,4.797535211267606
