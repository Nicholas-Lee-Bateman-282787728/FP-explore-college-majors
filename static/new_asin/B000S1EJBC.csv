2878730,5,B000S1EJBC,"""Shameless"" may be one of the best TV series I've ever seen, and without a doubt, aside from the BBC's ""Funland""(by some of folks who did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-League-of-Gentlemen-The-Complete-Series-1/dp/B00004Z4V5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The League of Gentlemen: The Complete Series 1</a>, it's the most obscene TV show I've ever seen, but the show is really well-acted and -written. If you're able to handle nekkid people & foul language, give it a shot.

Saying that, I paid about $40 for this 3-Season set from AmazonUK......people that charge prices like the ones that have this listed should be BANNED!",1281312000,2,669,6.271739130434782
