However, when I came back to purchase it, you say it's unavailable and that you don't know if you'll get it back in stock???  Each person who has reviewed this movie has given it a 5 star rating, including myself. So, why don't you try and get it again from the company, telling them it has a high rating and customers want to buy it?  Makes sense to me!",1370822400,7,436,4.046511627906977

3716623,5,B001NFPM8G,"Enjoyed the movie. Small correction. In Romania they don't say ""Sarbatori vesele"", that is the literal translation of ""Happy holidays"" that the automated google translation service would give you. In Romania they say ""Sarbatori fericite"". It is a Latin language, so think about it: felicita in Italian, feliz in Spanish, and fericit in Romanian. Such a common expression, you would think the screen play written could have google it better :)",1356480000,,442,5.23943661971831
3716624,5,B001NFPM8G,"We just watched the sweetest Christmas movie ""Crazy for Christmas"" - it is an absolutely beautiful movie that had us both smiling with tears in our eyes at the end.  I HIGHLY recommend it - we watched it on Netflix.  It was not a religious movie - in fact, there was NO religion mentioned.  There is one character that is gay, but it was approached VERY tastefully and sweet.  But did want to mention it in case that would bother anyone (it did not bother us).  I just really recommend this movie...5 stars! :)",1351555200,4,510,4.382978723404255

3716626,5,B001NFPM8G,"In the era when tv Christmas movies are about the prodigal returning home for Christmas and loving it so much they stay--this movie is refreshingly different.

It's about a young mother, Shannon McManus whose job as a limo driver doesnt quite provide for her young son.  Enter Howard Hesseman as a man with an overabundance of Christmas spirit throwing money around like an eccentric millionaire, which he is.

On Christmas Eve she drives him around town, discovering a little more about him and her past as the Christmas Eve day progresses.  With humor, warmth, some romance and unexpected surprises around every corner, this is a treat of a  Christmas movie.

Wish it were available on DVD in the U.S.",1259712000,9,703,4.8655462184873945

8326780,2,B001NFPM8G,"Andrea Roth is good in anything! Howard Hessman is cute here too. This is a story of a single mom working as a Limo driver trying to make ends meet. Also the story of a disgruntled Journalist. The Limo driver gets a call on Christmas Eve to transport a nut. An older man who keeps giving large bills to people everywhere he goes. Then the Journalist interviews an elf who calls small children bastards. The movie keeps cutting back and forth. The captions are off: they do not match the story. The sound is too low and the picture is messed up. The passenger then asks to get a haircut. While there his attorney shows up. Quite handsome. Passenger (sorry, no could not remember names) comes out of shop with a new haircut, throws big bills around then suggests his attorney and the driver get together, date...whatever! Later the Attorney shares that he has a ""life partner"". The female limo driver expresses her confusion about why the set up. That is when I had had enough. I might try to get my money back but lesson learned. By the way, one of the reasons I share all of this, instead of griping about the DVD or stating ""I liked the movie"", is because if I had read a review like mine, I would not have wasted my money. I give two stars because I like the actors, the premise of the movie and the little kid. However the audio and visual issues ruined it for me.",1520294400,,1367,4.34375

8326784,4,B001NFPM8G,"Shannon McManus-Johnson's wretched plight is a situation tailor-made for a Christmas movie, and so here we are. Shannon (Andrea Roth) is a limousine driver who is studying to be a CPA. She's also a single mom to a 7-year-old boy and divorced from a dentist husband who was caught cheating with his dental hygienist.

For this Christmas Eve she can afford only $20 with which to thrill her excited kid with a Christmas tree. And they end up with a scraggly-looking tree. It doesn't make the kid any happier when Shannon gets a call from her boss that dispatches her to drive a V.I.P. client on Christmas Eve. Her boss is willing to pay triple rate plus a bonus. Shannon reluctantly agrees to put in two hours, negotiating some vacation time and a week off in march to cram for the CPA exam. Oh, her poor kid, Trevor (Jason Spevack), now stuck being babysat by their neighbor, Mrs. Granger, who smells like a sock and whose cookies taste like cheese. Although one character would later beg to differ: ""I think those cookies had cement in them.""

Here's a wary Shannon side-eyeing her very important passenger, Fortune 500 mogul Fred Nickells (Howard Hesseman). This is a strange hombre. He leaps into Shannon's limo and off they go to several stops: a skating rink, a hot dog stand, a toy store... and at each stop there's Fred cheerfully tossing away hundred dollar bills to random people and wishing them a ""Merry Christmas"" in an impressive number of languages.

His eccentric behavior was bound to capture the media's attention. Which is where Peter Archer (Yannick Bisson) comes in. Peter is a reporter for WXMS News, Channel 6. He's a dedicated dude. He's worked thankless weekends on fluff pieces, and it's hard work that's paid off. He's up for the much coveted, career-making DC gig. But, this Christmas Eve, he just got tapped to look into a report of some goof publicly giving away C-notes to strangers.

Crazy for Christmas is a holiday movie that first aired in 2005 on the Lifetime channel. And while it falls short of being a classic, it's worth watching for Howard Hesseman's hijinks. I remember Hesseman fondly from WKRP in Cincinatti. Imagine Dr. Johnny Fever grown older and having given up having hangovers and become a philantrophist. Hesseman lavishes enough charm in his character Fred to make him lovable, never mind that I cringed at how so cavalier he was at giving away money like it was nothing.

Andrea Roth is Hesseman's foil, his straight (wo)man. But she's also more than that. She's also very good at drawing our sympathy. She's tough-minded and frank. She'll tell you off to your face. I really enjoyed the dynamics between her and Hesseman, especially the deeper into the plot the movie gets. I liked watching Shannon's bemused reactions when Fred is being a lovable kook. But, see, Fred Nickells is nursing a very big secret, and it's one to which Shannon reacts in a very strong way. Crazy for Christmas is a fun watch, mostly lighthearted in tone but occasionally diving into more dramatic themes, namely, themes of regret and forgiveness that are, gratifyingly, handled more sensitively than heavy-handedly. If I had to ding this movie on something, it's that there's a romance that gets shoehorned in. It didn't feel organic. You don't see me talking much about Yannick Bisson. To me, his reporter character was just meh. But watch Crazy for Christmas, anyway. I rate it above meh.",1514764800,,3419,4.807823129251701
