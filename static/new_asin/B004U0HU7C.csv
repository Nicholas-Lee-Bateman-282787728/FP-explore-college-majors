8441119,5,B004U0HU7C,I have several of Lee Holden's dvd's.  This one is very relaxing at the end of the day to help you get a good night sleep if you have had a stressful day. His voice is very soothing and the instructions are excellent.,1496880000,,217,4.046511627906977

8441121,5,B004U0HU7C,"I started using Qi Gong DVDs by Lee Holden several years ago when I saw him on a PBS fund raiser.  This particular DVD is excellent.  As compared with the beginner DVDs, this one moves a bit more quickly, has many more movements and, therefore, is longer.  Because I had done some of the beginner exercises, it was not difficult to pick up and use immediately.  Like the other DVDs in the series, the staging is beautiful and relaxing, his voice is calming and the narration adds a very rich component to the exercise.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone with stress, anxiety or insomnia.",1429747200,11,598,4.60377358490566
8441122,5,B004U0HU7C,"If you are looking for the most refreshing and restorative exercises, Lee Holden's qigong DVDs are the answer. Gentle, flowing, easy to follow and the routines work every muscle in my body. I started from the bottom as I was in a wheelchair for three years until 15 months ago. In the three months of daily qigong with the Holden routines I can walk with balance finally and my stamina has been restored. I cannot praise it highly enough--at least for all the lessons geared to beginners.",1423008000,13,488,4.620689655172414

This particular one, along with Qi Qong for more Energy (for a morning or daytime energy boost workout), is outstanding in terms of getting a great workout. As soon as I start this Deep Sleep workout, every time, it feels great and by the end its amazing. It makes me cleansed, physically and emotionally rejuvenated and replenished, sleepy but relaxed, and very ready for going right to bed at the end.

Not sure if this Deep Sleep & the more Energy ones would be good for a beginner at chi kung, there you may want to start with one of his other videos that are directed at beginners and move much more slowly, but if you do have some experience doing chi kung, you can start with these or any of his videos. I started with these two easily.

What Lee Holden does is create something similar to Vinyassa Flow Yoga in Yoga, where each single chi gung exercise flows into the next in a sensible manner with the result being in an incredibly beneficial workout by the end that is much stronger in effect than the usual chi gung routines. Even each exercise by itself that he gives you is very beneficial, but having them flow one to the other in a well thought out routine has a great effect.

In a way, it's like taking an extended normal chi gung routine like the 8 pieces of brocade or the Crane, and applying that kind of sequence to an entire routine but it's easy to do, not hard to follow like Tai Chi or other extended routines can be. Unlike Vinyassa Flow Yoga, which I find is often taught in a rapid, jerky, fast way that doesn't provide the meditative calm features of yoga, Holden's Flow method of Chi Gung is smooth, flowing, gentle, fluid, calming, and by the end of the workout incredibly energizing or in the case of Deep Sleep or PM workout, feel ready to head for bed completely cleansed, stress free and physically relaxed and rejuvenated.

I have been really blown away at how great it feels at the end of his workouts. His routines, the exercises, the entire routine, the background music, and his teaching and production values all come together in an excellent way that set the mood plus guide you through the exercises in a flow that is powerful and moving. Holden is an acupuncturist also, so he is able to tell you the benefits of each exercise physically for the body and explains that and chi kung philosophy beautifully while one does the workout, it adds to the excellence of his videos. This one in particular, For Deep Sleep is just outstanding.

One criticism of this routine is it's a bit too long at 42 minutes if one is doing it before bed time. What I did is after getting to know the routine after a couple weeks, I went through and picked out the parts I felt were more essential for me and use the fast forward button to get down to a 20-30 minute routine. However, the full routine does make me feel even better than the shorter one, but the shorter one is good enough to be quite excellent. Another criticism is this video doesn't have chapters, so you can't jump from one exercise to another on the remote, you have to fast forward, a small annoyance. Another short criticism is that Holden puts a lot of neck roll stretches in this routine, way more than I need, so I fast forward through all but a few of those.

I found his routines easy to learn and follow, without strain, and smooth. You know, some chi gung teachers are too angular in movement. Others are too slow or fast. Lee's style is just right and perfect, and clearly he's worked on how to do it so the student can benefit the most easily.

I just can't recommend his videos more. I have been doing chi gung for a good 17 years and Holden's are the best chi gung routines I've come across.",1303257600,44,3785,4.397142857142857
