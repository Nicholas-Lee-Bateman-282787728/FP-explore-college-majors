8421163,5,B004AXTSTW,"This is a really good documentary. I particularly enjoyed the 2 ""bonus"" videos. A shame this drama is not more easily available. I was really lucky to get this copy for about 50 bucks. A lot has been said and written on John James, but sadly, his biography has not been made into a movie or better- a mini-series. If any artist/naturalist deserves a 10 hour documentary (are you listening Ken Burns??) or a mini-series (sadly, Richard Chamberlain is now too aged to play JJA, boo-hoo!)  This adventurist led an amazing life and made an amazing contribution to ornithology- take THAT Mister George Ord!!!!",1439251200,,604,4.8076923076923075
