8122391,1,B000FGVF7G,It was a disappointment to me. I thought it would be more of a story instead of a documentry. Very boring.,1301270400,,106,4.095238095238095
8122392,5,B000FGVF7G,"Very well done documentary, showing the power of God to change lives.  It's a good example of someone who had a good upbringing, but chose the path of evil. The film showed that a Christian should be subject to the law of the land (read Romans 13).  Now that He has become a Christian in prison (repented of his sins, and fully trusted Christ for salvation), he subjects himself to civil law, and thanks God that he wasn't executed.  Charles doesn't try to blame anyone but himself for the crimes, yet understands the power and capability of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross to be sufficient to pay for even the most henious crimes (e.g., one of the theives on the cross next to Jesus).  The film doesn't go into too much detail regarding the crimes (not graphic), which is good, as they were horrible events.  Instead, the film spends a lot of time on Charles' upbringing and how he got connected to the Manson Family.

I won't give away the high point of the film, but will say you'd better have some tissues or a handkerchief ready when you watch this one!

This is a great film to share with folks that are skeptical about (real) Christians being new creations, so I would highly recommend it.",1300924800,,1194,4.5
8122393,1,B000FGVF7G,"This film should prove Tex Watson is a monster. Yes, he duped Rosemary LaBianca's daughter onto his side but the rest of the LaBianca clan sees him for what he is.  This film is the same yarn told by Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and the rest of the Manson Killers, ""We were just confused kids! It was the 1960's, Let us out !.  YouTube is full of videos of Tex's parole hearings where  Sharon Tate's mother Doris says it all. The film is cheaply made and is Tex's side of the Helter Skelter saga where Tex, like the girls,  lays blame for the Tate LaBianca murders solely on Manson.  Best book on the Manson Murders is Greg King's book. ""Sharon Tate & The Manson Murders "".  Tex has since being jailed has married, fathered 3 children and was getting, until Doris Tate managed to get it stopped congenial visits with his spouse. Doris said it best. "" They are treated better than our elderly ""  Tex deserves no parole or anything else. If anyone needs clemency it is Roman Polanski. The psychologist who examined him in 1978 after he was arrested for having illegal sex with a 13 yr old girl said Sharon's loss drove him to it. Check out Greg King's book, Check Out YOUTUBE videos with Doris Tate, and see the film. ""Roman Polanski, Wanted & desired"" and you will realize what BS this movie is.",1231027200,2,1297,4.401673640167364
