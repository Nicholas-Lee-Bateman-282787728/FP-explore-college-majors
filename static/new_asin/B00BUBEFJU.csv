8573920,4,B00BUBEFJU,"Marilyn Henrion is cool.  I was inspired by her story.  I always feel a bit jealous hearing about all the interesting artsy people who were hanging out in New York during the 50s and 60s.  She has enjoyed many interesting friendships, and I loved hearing about all the cool folks her kids were growing up around.  Henrion's work is very, very unique.  Even if you are not a quilt person, which I'm not, you have to give her lots of credit for innovation and composition.  Truly fascinating pieces.",1491868800,,497,4.590909090909091
