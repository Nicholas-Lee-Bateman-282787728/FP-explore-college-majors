2569530,4,B000FJGR6M,A great campy film with giant robots. The effects are not great but good enough. It looks great on MY TV. The Japanese Rocky style feel good film of the year. I wish the subtitles did not go below the wide screen or that there was a English dub. After watching it with subtitles once I will not even need trhem again. It will be easy to follow the second time with out the subtitles.,1167091200,,383,4.12
2569531,4,B000FJGR6M,"This retelling of the Tetsujin 28/Gigantor legend on film brings the story into the 21 century.  It is a great kids film, unfortunately the Geneon company was too cheap to pay for an English dub.  Most kids can't or won't sit through a movie with subtitles.

The special effects were a little disappointing in places.  The CGI robots look like GGI robots and they are not much of an improvement over the old man in the rubber suit which has been a staple of kaiju (giant monster) films for years.  I think it is worth seeing if you like japanese anime and monster movies.

2569532,3,B000FJGR6M,Yes its Just OK. I didn't think this was a sbad as the other reviews. But atleast the video quality is good. If you are thinking about buying the ULTRAMAN vol. 1 from BCI. Dont buy it. It sucks. Buy Tetsugin 28 the movie instead.,1153353600,3,229,4.111111111111111
2569533,2,B000FJGR6M,"I had an opportunity to see this movie at the 2005 New York Asian Film Festival, and it was really bad. I had no prior exposure to the long history of Tetsujin 28 (Gigantor), and I thought at the very least that it would be a decent kaiju (giant monster) movie.

Essentially, the little boy as a main character is totally uninteresting, and there just isn't that much action in the movie. I can't imagine that it would hold a child's attention, and I was certainly bored as well.

Unless you are a huge Tetsujin fan, avoid this one.",1148428800,8,532,4.363636363636363
8123557,2,B000FJGR6M,I love giant robots but this just does not cut it. The biggest stumbling block is the kid Shotaro. He is so whiney it is almost impossible to sit through any scene with him in it.  I don't know any 10 year kid anywhere that would not give up his right arm to control a giant robot - but this annoying little kid wants nothing to do with it. Totally unbelievable.,1432080000,,362,4.098591549295775
8123558,4,B000FJGR6M,"I'm amused enough that there even is a Japanese Giant Robot genre, but there is and Tetsujin has always been a part of it.
Coming from a childhood of imported Japanese animation it's been great as I've gotten older to get a chance to get back to some of the roots of the genre and experience the joy and innocence that the children in Japan got to have watching these shows unadulterated.

Tetsujin 28 - The Movie is a fun and enjoyable romp through the first live action entry in the series, and despite being worried about production values it's surprisingly good and delivers on the promise of it's action. the CGI robots are well integrated and don't look at all cheesy(a huge concern I had going in). The plot is serviceable, there's the missing dad, the older mentor, the mom trying to protect her boy, the potential love but still innocent smart older girl, and the innocence of the boy himself (however I could have done without the comic relief policeman). It's the ""hero's journey"" trope, but handled well and in a way that makes it very accessible.

In the initial act of the film there's a great scene with the ""Giant Robot Terrorism Task Force"" I don't know if it was intended to be translated that way, but even if intentional I'm glad it was there, it helps properly set the tone of the movie.

Be warned there are some discrepancies in the Amazon description, this isn't animated, and 3rd party sellers seem to have trouble getting the right movie to you, but it's worth sticking with until they get it right. I also experienced some slight aspect ratio issues, but they may be in the transfer, it wasn't a big issue, just the film being slightly squashed vertically.",1360022400,,1683,4.584717607973422
8123559,5,B000FJGR6M,"The way to mixed anime robots and real people makes a different perception of the movie. It is not a cartoon movie. It was filmed in Tokyo streets in 2005, so we can see the real Tokyo way of live in several scenes.",1352160000,,215,4.023255813953488
8123560,3,B000FJGR6M,"Gigantor as us americans know him stars in his own feature film. A japanese creation known as Tetsujin 28 this film brings me back to the days when the trans-lux cartoon played on UHF stations and I would bearly get reception. It's a cool flick and the cg work holds up,I only wish there was more robot battles. The Black Ox an evil robot is Tetsujin's nemises who appeared in the cartoon series. Worth a peek especially if your a fan of the Gigantor series. The dvd is in japanese with english subtitles.",1325030400,,505,4.440860215053763
8123561,4,B000FJGR6M,"Since I grew up watching the old Gigantor cartoons, I thought this movie was really neat and fun to watch. Not 5-star material for me, and reading English subtitles is a bit cumbersome, I found it enjoyable none the less.  I think some of those who rated it poorly are much younger viewing audiences.",1302134400,,300,4.555555555555555
8123562,1,B000FJGR6M,"What this movie has going for it is at least they kept a design similar to the original Tetsujin and not some way-out new incarnation, and the militaristic exciting theme song.  Gigantor (Tetsujin) should have had yellow eyes and Black Ox the red ones instead of the other way around as they were in this. Plus I can never deal with the overly bright light to medium blue color of Tetsujin (Gigantor). It only serves to enhance its already toyish cartoony look. Blueish gray or grayish blue would have been more effective for realism. If they ever decide to try it again they better use suit actors. I hate the over use of CGI. CGI should be used for things like lasers, explosions, ghosty effects, and things like that. Not for brick and mortar tactile objects. I also agree with the other reviewers that the robot fights are lousy slow and boring. Japanese monster movie makers have perfected the art of suitmation (actor in a monster/robot suit) and that's what they should stick to. It looks way cooler than stupid CGI. King Kong vs Godzilla, War of the Gargantuas, Monster Zero, the list goes on, didn't use CGI. Of course it didn't exist then and THANK GOD FOR THAT!  Robot Kong aka MechaniKong is totally awesome. This movie would have been so much better if they followed a King Kong Escapes idea with an evil Dr Who (Hu) type bent on ruling the world for the sake of evil itself instead of the painfully overdone ""I'm evil because someone I loved died"" and the supposed hero-boy who is supposed to control the giant robot to save the day is nothing but a wussy whimp or whimpy wuss, which ever way you like.  And of course the failure to bring together the Tetsujin/Gigantor team of (I forget the original Japanese names) Jimmy Sparks, Dr Bob Brilliant, Inspector Blooper and last but not least Dick Strong to oppose the main villain was a gigantic missed opportunity.",1291248000,,1877,4.61377245508982
8123563,2,B000FJGR6M,"TETSUJIN 28 is a Japanese live-action film based on Mitsuteru Yokoyama's manga series best known in the west for its 1963 black-and-white animated adaptation that played on U.S. television in 1966 under the title, ""Gigantor."" There are some pretty spectacular scenes here of two giant robots, Tetsujin 28 and Black Ox, trudging around the streets of Tokyo and making a dent in its skyline, including one harrowing move where Black Ox bends back the top of the Tokyo Tower. There's even a great bit where Black Ox hurls the disabled Tetsujin into the Diet (Parliament) Building. These sequences are quite exciting and well-done, as if cameras were on the scene and caught the action as it was unfolding. Unfortunately, the two subsequent robot battles don't deliver the goods. The punches thrown are pretty weak and there's not a lot of movement in the fights. The robots never fly up and fight each other in the air, even though, by the final encounter, they both indeed have that power. The original animated series had far more satisfying giant robot action than we get here.

Even worse, the young boy, Shotaro, who's been designated to operate the remote device that controls Tetsujin, never really seems to want to do it. He's weak and scared for most of the film. When he finally steps up to the plate and accepts his role at the 90-minute mark--way too long for us to have to wait--he's not particularly effective. While the boy playing Shotaro may be offering a realistic portrayal of how an actual ten-year-old would react under the circumstances, I must confess I wasn't exactly looking for realism. I wanted the boy to be gung ho all the way and eager to control that powerful robot and send it into furious combat to put an end to Black Ox's depredations. Exactly how Shotaro (or ""Jimmy Sparks"" as he was known in ""Gigantor"") behaved in the original manga and anime. Or the boy heroes in ""Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot"" and the 1960s Gamera movies. These new Japanese boy heroes are really wimpy when put to the test (see also Toru in GAMERA THE BRAVE and Tadashi in THE GREAT YOKAI WAR, two films also made in 2005, and both also reviewed on this site). What does this say about the next generation of Japanese heroes? At least Ash from ""Pokmon"" still knows what to do in the face of a threat.

I did like one aspect of the movie, though. I enjoyed seeing two Japanese pop music idols in the cast. The older one is Hiroko Yakushimaru who was popular in the 1980s and starred in a film I remember called SAILOR SUIT AND MACHINE GUN (1981). She plays Shotaro's mother and she's quite a beauty. The other is one of my all-time favorite J-pop singers, Yuko Nakazawa, one of the founding members of Morning Musume, here playing a young police detective assigned to the case. They give her short dark hair and a rather plain navy blue suit, clearly an attempt to play down her usual glamour, but she has plenty to do and it's always a thrill to see her in action. Another key female character is Mami Tachibana (played by Yu Aoi), a robotics expert from MIT recruited to help refurbish Tetsujin 28 after a disastrous battle early on. She's young and spunky and looks sharp in a uniform and beret as she befriends young Shotaro.

The music score by Akira Senju is nice and melodic and keeps things upbeat when the film slows down (which it frequently does). I actually have the soundtrack CD as well. The end music segues into a replay of the male chorus singing the ""Tetsujin 28"" theme song from 1963, accompanied by shots from the original manga, which looks a lot more action-packed than anything in this movie. The Pioneer/Geneon DVD offers no English credits anywhere, except what's on the DVD case.",1237680000,4,3714,4.641337386018237
8123564,5,B000FJGR6M,"My favorite TV show when I was young was Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot, which was based on Mitsuteru Yokoyama's Tetsujin manga. When I found out about this movie, I had to check it out. I really enjoyed it, even more than the Giant Robo anime series. This story line was very straight-forward. I've never seen the original manga, but it appears this movie was pretty faithful to it. I'm assuming that's why the robot battles weren't very exciting by today's standards. Sure there was collateral damage, but Tetsujin has no weapons, so he couldn't fight like the Giant Robo I grew up with.

I'd recommend this movie to Giant Robot fans everywhere. See a modern movie based on the manga that started it all!",1226966400,3,709,4.626984126984127
8123565,4,B000FJGR6M,"I just want to write this review in case, like me, there is someone who really wants to see it but was put off by bad reviews.

  Because I was expecting bad by some external reviews, I was surprisingly surprised... by the effort put in all round - the drama, the build up, the awesome intros of the robots.

  That someone made this is a treat and plenty for me to get it and I'm glad I did.

  Great in these days they kept the robot designs purely simple, not changing or detailing, with shiny reflective surfaces.

  It makes me think why haven't they made more GIANT ROBOT films, preferably CG but even otherwise?

  Just that makes this unique.

  For me, the CGI was almost always real - unlike REPTILIAN, the only other Eastern CGI monster I can think of, who was too cartoony looking. These bots are solid, and the sound effects are impressive, just right. Aample part-of-building destruction is perfect.

  I never understand or agree when people say the CG is bad in movies where it's the best. I think, maybe if those people saw a REAL monster/robot/dino roaming the street - they'd have to say it looks unreal. Get what I mean?

  The robots have a generous amount of screen time.

  The reactions of people are all real too, though the boy seems to have taken his cue from the Jurassic Park kid, he certainly tries hard. But yes, he does get too sobby after the whole film.

  And the later robot fights leave lots to be desired, overall I am pleased to compromise more than normal.

  And guess what? This is the first film in history that I know of since Close Encounters that actually had lightning well BEFORE thunder instead of simultaneously! At least half the time it did, lol. It was a dream come true for me.",1170374400,8,1731,4.4281150159744405
8123566,1,B000FJGR6M,"Called a Live Action Movie, this is indeed a movie, it is live, but it is void of any action.  Take two action figures  make them face each other with fist draw.  Hold them at the waist and swing at each other this is exactly the type of action you will see in this movie.  I love Gigantor (Tetsujin 28) but I need to save anyone else from blowing any type of money and more importantly time watching this movie.",1169078400,,412,4.1125
