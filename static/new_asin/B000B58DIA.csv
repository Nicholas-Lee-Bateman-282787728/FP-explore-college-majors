2399947,4,B000B58DIA,"Subtle humor, breathtaking natural views.  The interaction between father and son also comes across very natural.  I recommend it highly.",1364947200,,137,5.8
2399948,4,B000B58DIA,"It is amusing to read the 1- and 2-star review of this film - I wonder what these reviewers were expecting? This is a movie with a slow, reflective pace, but not extremely so. But having endured through Bela Tarr's 7 hour magnum opus Satantango recently, I guess I am more than sufficiently conditioned!

Anyway, in spite of the generally meditative pace of the movie, there is a lot of latent tension between the main characters, and I find it managed to maintain dramatic tension even during scenes like the laundry scene ridiculed by another reviewer.

A more well-known movie with a similar theme is ""The Road"" with Viggo Mortensen. If you liked that one, definitely give ""Roads to Koktebel"" a try.",1359849600,,702,4.745901639344262
2399949,2,B000B58DIA,"Many times, filmmakers give us minimalism in film, it works often, but there are quite few times, when it does not work great.  This film is lengthy on the scenes, meaning specifically, the duration of a scene, but light on dialogue.  There are several shots in the film where the camera stayed a much longer time on the subject than usual.  I don't know if the viewer became more engrossed in the lengthy scenes of  ""almost nothing"", or was it more annoying.

And another example of a lengthy unexplainable scene is where a woman hangs clothes on the line, and I believe we see her hang each item from the clothes basket......each item!

This certainly isn't a film for the novice foreign film watcher.  Frankly, if you are new to watching foreign language film, please do not start with this one.  You will remain puzzled and rather bored.

A father son bonding film follows the journey Russia.  The father has recently lost the wife/mother and the trek across the countryside in search of Koktebel.  The father, an alcoholic and his 11 year old son, travel on foot, or railroad.  The young man has a mission, but the father falling off the wagon, seems haphazard in the quest.  They do encounter characters along the way, and even working during the trek.  Cinematography is great.

Realistically, I can't see much happened.  And, I am sure one needs to grasp the idea of father and son in their relationship, but it is difficult to grasp that.  It was difficult to hold on the the film with feelings, wonderment, or excitement.

Film Movement generally brings wonderful films from around the world, films by good actors, directors, and great storylines.  This fell short!

I like minimalist films, but this one didn't do it for me.....Rizzo",1355961600,,1744,4.75
2399950,4,B000B58DIA,"I agree that the pace was slow, but the story was very well drawn out for viewers. I look for films like this because, again, it was more about the disturbing (and somewhat depressing) story than 'the stuff that happens between the special FX'.

Hollywood doesn't seem to make cool movies like this anymore (Except for ""The Road"")

This wasn't the best film I've seen, but it was a welcome 'Change of pace' film, who's style seems to be disappearing. At least in the US.

If anyone is interested, see if you can find (and watch) ""Lilya 4-Ever"" (or, depending where you look, ""Lilja 4-Ever"") w/ Oksana Akinshina ...it's a 'sad ...but very real' story",1338768000,4,678,4.625
2399951,2,B000B58DIA,"I gave it two stars for cinematography only. Otherwise it's pretty bland, you'll regret watching it all the way through. Bratty kid and messed up dad traveling through Russian country side depending on kindness of strangers as they go. Some people are nice and some are less than kind, it has potential at first then it drops off precipitously.",1318550400,,344,4.8474576271186445
2399952,5,B000B58DIA,"A father and his 11 year old son embark on a journey across Russia to reach Koktebel, the Ukrainian seaside town. With no money they hop on trains and rely on 'kindness of strangers', who at times are not that kind at all.

Through a series of unexpected events, we see how their relationship if affected by quite often the opposite stands they take, but at the same time the support and warmth they have for each other.

This is a very emotional journey in the depth of family bonds and self-discovery.

Gleb Puskepalis (son of Sergei Puskepalis, star of Popogrebsky's later film Simple Things and Zvyagintsev's The Banishment) is excellent and very moving in his role of the son.",1295308800,6,681,4.658333333333333
2399953,4,B000B58DIA,"""Roads to Koktebel"" is a film for the patient.  It unfolds meticulously and slowly.  After the opening titles, we focus on a drainage ditch underneath a road.  We see a car go by.  It rains.  A dog comes and barks.  Finally, our two main characters emerge and slowly pack up their meager belongings.  About two minutes pass on the opening shot from the same camera angle.  The scene shifts.  We see the boy on a train.  A long shot reveals the father asleep and the son staring out at the countryside passing.  This takes about a minute and a half.  This is a film that creates a compelling cinematic experience in a style the polar opposite of our stateside cinema.

Boris Khlebnikov has subsequently directed ""Free Floating"" in which Evgenii Sytyi who plays the railway inspector in ""Koktebel"" also has a part.  His partner in direction and writing is Aleksei Popogrebsky who has since done a film with the English title ""Simple Things.""  They are not in a hurry, which allows the subtleties of the experience to show.  The Russian dialogue is sparse for those wary of subtitles.

Gleb Puskepalis plays the son.  He does an excellent job.  In a tightly controlled performance, the boy shows us his dependence on his father, his need for independence, his growing into manhood as he bravely takes off without his father, and his childhood self as he breaks down and cries.  Aleksandr Ilyin who has been in over 30 films since 1960 plays a truck driver who transports the son to Koktebel and the Black Sea.

Igor Csernyevics who has done 10 films including ""Junk"" and ""Guys from Mars"" (English titles) also does a good job as the father.  We see emotional levels peeled away.  At first he is the down and out dad out of work and forced to travel to his sister's apartment in Crimea.  The he stops at the home of Mikhail played by Vladimir Kucherenko to earn some money by repairing a roof.  We discover the father's alcohol problem.  Events take him to a nurse Kseniya (or Xenia in translation) played by Agrippina Steklova.  We see the father's growing attachment to her as she nurses him back to health.  The son discovers his father's relationship as he sees his dad's boxer shorts draped on a chair in Xenia's bedroom one night as he heads to go to the bathroom.  Csernyevics obviously loves his son, but has manly needs that the death of his wife created.  The final wordless frames bring the relationship full circle.

Being a viewer from the USA, I have to admit that while watching this DVD, it seemed tedious to me.  I did come to appreciate the subtle performances as the relationship between father and son developed.  The DVD has an animated short called The Box Man that won awards.  This is an interesting film for those prepared to slow down and take a break.  The countryside is beautiful.  Enjoy!",1205280000,6,2813,4.623481781376518
2399954,3,B000B58DIA,"A pleasant enough road movie, about a divorced man (or widowed, I don't remember) going with his young son from Moscow to the Crimea. He's an aeronautical engineer who has been fired and has hit the bad times (maybe with the recovery of Russia's economy under Putin, the argument is slightly out of date). We see them traveling through the countryside in a dilapidated train, and through the bad roads of Western Russia and Eastern Ukraine. Nothing much happens, but before reaching the Black Sea they stop at small towns, where they offer to repair the roof to a house where a mean old man lives, meet a pretty young doctor, etc. Some reviews I read wrote about the pair traveling through the desolate steppes of the former Soviet Union, yet this is some of the most fertile and densely populated part of that country. The pace is slow, though not terribly so, compared with traditional Russian cinema. And the characters seem real people, even if the plot is slightly farfetched. Reccommended.",1197072000,13,995,4.790697674418604
2399955,5,B000B58DIA,"This Russian road movie finds a father and 11-year-old son traveling hundreds of miles on foot from Moscow to a village on the Black Sea. The pace is slow and hypnotic; the situation is unpromising. They are out of money and the season is turning gradually toward winter. The storyline itself is elliptical and relies little if it at all on exposition. We simply watch as the two trudge onward, under leaden skies and across rain-swept distances, depending on the kindness of strangers. The boy, worldly wise beyond his years and distrusting his father, dreams of flight and wind sailing. He has a mysterious sort of second sight that permits him to see himself and his surroundings from high above. Meanwhile, earthbound, the camera follows the two of them across endless sodden, forlorn landscapes.

The people they meet along the way are often little better off than they are, living in a kind of defeated ennui, making do, getting by, lonely, and often sustained by alcohol. One man offers them shelter and a roofing job on a house that seems to be abandoned and falling down. When a more generous householder makes the boy even more impatient to reach their destination, the father's unwillingness to press on precipitates a final crisis. Finally, the movie is a long, melancholy but lyrically told story, with fine performances, about life journeys and the contrast between youthful dreams and desperate realities.",1191801600,23,1420,4.991561181434599

2399957,4,B000B58DIA,"Very good road movie about a father and his son traveling from Moscow to the Crimea on foot. The young boy, probably about 11, appears more mature than his alcoholic father. Good scenery and good acting. I enjoyed this movie.",1457740800,,225,4.65

2399960,4,B000B58DIA,"An interesting movie, and an interesting story line. I think that the story would be good in any language/country, but this movie has the added allure of being on a journey though the Russian countryside. I have recommended it to friends.",1454544000,,238,4.829268292682927
2399961,4,B000B58DIA,"The story is a duality about the future and past of Russia thru the eyes of a melancholy boy and his hopeful father, outcasts as they travel across a featureless landscape.

2399972,5,B000B58DIA,"As with most Russian films I have watched, Roads to Koktebel transports the (foreign) viewer into another place and time--not with special effects or a thrilling, action-packed plot, but with characters who reflect the so-called Russian soul and the pathos that accompanies transition. The slowly unfolding scenes force one to reflect rather than be entertained. The art forms that are distinctly Russian require refection--because they represent life, and more specifically, the inner workings of people's hearts.  As in life, our transformations do not occur in ""flash points,"" but in ever-widening circles of revelation. The acting in this film was excellent. The cinematography stunning and frequently off-putting, which is by intent, I believe. It makes the viewer think. Pause. Wonder. This film does not spoon-feed its message.

8081408,5,B000B58DIA,"I was deeply moved by Roads to Koktebel and liked it even more on a second screening. It is a character driven movie, which is different from a plot driven one, and we learn about the relationship between the characters slowly.  Relationships are not easy to portray in a film without some sort of dramatic plot, in which case the action becomes the focus.

Here the complexity of the love between the father and son and the pain is the focus.  We slowly, their about feelings and difficulties, the fathers love and longing to protect his son while failing over and over. It is very sad and also beautiful. The final shot of the film is very powerful and to me implies that the difficult relationship will stumble forward. This reflects the movement and lack of movement of relationships in life.

There is some truth to the reviews that say the film lacks plot and ends where it starts off. But this for me is part of its beauty.",1513468800,,930,4.485207100591716

8081410,1,B000B58DIA,"I was expecting some grand finale, to reel in the slow development of the plot. In the end, there is no ending, and there is no real point to this movie. Is it an interesting view into the life of Russians in the countryside, and does it touch on many themes and characters often found in Russia? Yes. It does give a glimpse into the poverty in Russia, the homelessness, and the alcoholism. It shows many common types of people such as these wanderers, the alcoholic man, the truck driver, and the rather depressing and impoverished lifestyle in Russia. For this, the film is worth watching. However, the plot development and cinematography leave a lot to be desired. Rather disappointed that this film was so highly reviewed, and yet there was no real message, no real plot, and no real story here. It was simply a short glimpse into a boring and depressing life of a young boy and his father, the end.",1508803200,,903,4.54601226993865
