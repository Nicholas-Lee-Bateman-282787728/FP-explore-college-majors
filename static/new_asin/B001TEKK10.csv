This is a seriously dangerous way to make soap. Lye is lethal. A drop splashed on your skin can cause painful burns. I hate to think what would happen if that lye splashed someplace else - like in your eye.

Check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soap-Maker-s-Workshop-The-Art-and-Craft-of-Natural-Homemade-Soap/dp/1440207917/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soap Maker's Workshop: The Art and Craft of Natural Homemade Soap</a>&nbsp;for the safe way to make soap. (Okay, so you don't need the chemist's ventilation hood - but at least he's dresses appropriately. Seriously, this stuff is dangerous!)

The ladies in the video are sweet as honey. The set is homey and pleasant. The video quality is very good. The video itself is great. It's just the instruction I have issue with. They make a series of videos teaching everything from soap to bread making - and many marketed to beginners. I think its very irresponsible for them not to address the virtues of safety gear. If they don't want to wear it - fine. But please educate others so they can make an informed choice.

Packaging, natural colorants and fragrances are touched on. The soap is made in an inexpensive pot and poured into a simple plastic tub to mold. The do a nice job of capturing the simple pleasures of soap making. Now if they would just slap on some goggles.",1329868800,14,1406,5.263392857142857
3789298,4,B001TEKK10,It was a great video with easy step by step instructions. The only thing i didn't like was that they cut the soap only after 3 hours when they should of waited for 24 hours. Other then that it was a good video.,1321228800,5,210,3.9069767441860463
3789299,5,B001TEKK10,This was VERY informative and easy to understand!  I would very much recommend this video or any in the collection!!!!  I loved it and the ladies were delightful and fun to watch.,1302307200,,179,4.5625
3789300,5,B001TEKK10,"This is an excellent video - high quality & well produced. It gives GREAT info especially for visual learners like myself who sometimes have trouble reading something in a book then making it work in a real-life situation. This gave great info for those who are starting or thinking about starting to make soap for the first time. Invaluable resource for a beginning to intermediate soap makers! If you are a very experienced soap maker, you might not get a LOT of valuable information from this DVD, but you will still be inspired by these ladies & it will give you more inspiration to take your soap making with gusto!",1267574400,8,620,4.6454545454545455
3789301,5,B001TEKK10,I received  the complete collection for a gift and what a delight these dvds are! I have spent many a night pouring over soapmaking books because this is a skill I have long wanted to learn. I have been unable to find anyone in my area to teach me and this dvd filled the gap. I am a very visual person and I learn much quicker if I can watch someone do it instead of just reading about it. They go over both lye and hand-milled (melt and pour) soap making. I definitely feel like I learned from the dvd and would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to make soap at home.,1262131200,16,577,4.017391304347826

8341125,5,B001TEKK10,"Really want to thank them all for the effort and it is such a blessing to watch, which may benefit so many.

Personally, I go a little bit further and do not use foreign (imported) ingredients like coconut oil or olive oil, nor do I buy ""essential oils"" from a factory distillation or synthetic process.  I use only American vegetable shortening (since I do not want any animal products such as is common in nearly all store-bought soaps = tallowate or tallow) and herbs that I grow myself; in other words, only American ingredients, 100 percent and even local, if possible.",1355097600,3,574,4.673267326732673
8341126,4,B001TEKK10,It was great. I wished it showed more soap recipes. It showed alot of how to remake soap but I still enjoyed the West Ladies.,1352937600,2,125,4.04
8341127,3,B001TEKK10,"This is an okay DVD tutorial on soapmaking, but the whole thing feels a bit amateurish.  For example, you don't see any of the ladies wearing safely goggles and gloves even though lye splashed in your eye can make you go blind!  The vinegar neutralization tip is accurate though.  Some other things that make it seem like an amateur production the way that they constantly would ask a question, and then not really be able to answer it.  For example, at one point one of them asks ""what is the benefits of making soap at home?"" and the mother says something like ""oh the olive oil is probably good for your skin, and they coconut oil is also probably good too come to think of it"".  It's obvious that she has no idea if that's even true.  It really seems like they didn't do their research on these questions ahead of time before they started recording.  My only other complaint is that sometimes it's hard to follow the ingredients mentioned; it would've been helpful to have a nice poster or something set up in the background with the ingredients/steps listed on it while they worked.  Or perhaps they could've edited in a screen with the ingredients/steps listed so that anyone can just pause the DVD on that scene as needed.  Other than that, it is a rather pleasant video, but I wouldn't rely solely on it as a beginner soap maker (due to them not mentioning safety equipment) and more advanced soap-makers won't find any advanced tips in this video, so they probably wouldn't get much out of it either.  Be that as it may, I'm not really sure who would find this useful.  I guess it's useful for anyone who just wants to physically see someone make soap (with no goggles!) but that's about it.",1343347200,5,1700,4.522875816993464
