2444886,4,B000BX6FW8,Innocence is probably the most challenging film I've seen but if you sit back you can figure out most things. A little girl arrives in a cioffin to a school in the middle of the woods. She lives in a house with other girls older than she is. The studies are simple:nature and ballet. Lots of play. But where do the older girls go? Why is no one allowed to leave? Who are the old ladies? A film about growing up with strings attached.,1201219200,3,433,4.166666666666667
2444887,4,B000BX6FW8,"If there is a plot to this movie, my wife and I missed it.  However, it does have the capacity to keep one fascinated with the movie, always hoping that something by the end will tie everything together to make watching it a satisfying experience.  There are just too many unanswered aspects of this movie to make it seem to have been worth watching as far as 'story' goes.  The first question is how and why are the girls chosen to go to the 'school.'  My wife kept wondering why no parents ever seemed to show any concern about their daughter.  Could it be that each class was groomed for perfection for one to be chosen for some pagan human sacrifice at puberty?  We never know.  So, we are left to wonder for what purpose such a school existed.

It also seemed a bit curious to me that the girls always seemed to wear their panties, even in the bathroom scenes and when they went swimming in the lake.  I'm old enough to remember when the YMCA required all the boys to swim naked if they used the pool.  In an all-girl, little girl, setting such as this school, it would seem that nudity would be natural.  [There is one scene where 12-year-old Bianca gets out of the tub and you see her fully naked reflection in the mirror; but she is alone.]  For a movie entitled 'Innocence' it seemed interesting that the ultimate prepubescent innocence was avoided.

At the end of the movie, the oldest girls are taken by train to Paris.  We never know why.  For the first time in years the girls observe children laughing and playing like normal kids, a stark contrast to the almost militaristic lives they've led. We don't know from the story if this is just a 'field trip' or if the older women had just left them to fend for themselves.  Whatever the reason, the girls soon 'revert' from their picture-perfect selves to normal kids.  Is the message of the movie that, underneath, kids are really children no matter how regimented adults make their lives?  I would not presume to make any such judgments for you; you'll just have to watch the movie and try to figure out what, if any, meaning it has.",1199750400,14,2096,4.442408376963351
2444888,3,B000BX6FW8,"Seriously, I don't know what Home Vision did to this film, as it is the dvd image renders it almost unwatchable. There's just too much combing (when a progressive image is made out of an interlaced one and the image gets ""videodromey"" whenever there's more movement onscreen).

Being a movie about children, every time they would go out to play and dance around the school, there was some crazy ""The Ring""-like effect because of the bad encoding, I thought the children where getting out of the TV to kill me, completely took me out of the story.",1199491200,37,546,4.628865979381444
2444909,4,B000BX6FW8,"Dark And Mysterious! I guess Im late to the cinema, but I just watched this movie several time in the last month, and Im still not sure that I actually get it. However, it is not everyday that a dull, allegorical, weird and strange movie can hold my attention long enough to watch it all the way through. This one did.

I could see clearly that Ms. Hadzihalilovic managed to capture the flavor of adolescence and the preteen enigma, but it seems that the more she brought all that out, the more mysterious the movie became. Surprisingly, I found the movie quite interesting from the time Laura committed suicide on. I still don't understand the need to send the girls away when they reach the age of 12 (the purple ribbons). And why drop them at this huge fountain in the middle of the city and leave them there? Does it symbolize the end of some journey? Like I said, Im not sure I really get it.

I have to admire the unashamed acting of the young girls in the cast. They portrayed living with great expectation and dread at the same time in a very good way. But then, their characters had no choice. A very interesting film, although I wouldnt recommend them making many such films. I think there must be thousands of deviants out there who would vote this movie the best film of the decade! There is a very dark tone to this film.",1405123200,,1334,4.375
2444910,5,B000BX6FW8,Was a good movie. If you was to watch something different give this a shot. You will have to read this because there is no English dub.,1401494400,,135,4.037037037037037
2444911,4,B000BX6FW8,"A 5 year old girl wanted to see this film, she really enjoyed it.  Even though some of the stuff went past her head.  I liked the film for different reasons, entirely.  To me, the scenery and boarding school that focused on kids appeals to kids that age to watch the film.  It has a  feminine portrayal of European Boarding Schools in the 1950's 1960's.  If you never been to Europe or not born there, this film might be confusing and hard for you to understand, since it deals with growing up and becoming an adult in a certain society.",1396656000,,537,4.32
2444912,3,B000BX6FW8,Wasn't what I thought it was going to be like and has some stuff that is kinda sad in the story!!,1389657600,,97,3.6666666666666665
2444913,5,B000BX6FW8,"An excellent and magical film which is definitely not for everyone, ""Innocence"" can be experienced on at least two levels.

First, the entire film is a dreamlike allegory about girls venturing through childhood and into puberty. It is tinged with a sense of anxiety about the challenges and uncertainties of adulthood, toward which all children journey. Also, there is a sense of trepidation about being molded to the dictates of a society unconcerned with your personal gifts, desires and aspirations. In tone and feeling, it is like dream-vision poetry from the medieval age. If you're watching ""Innocence"" and thinking, ""Where is there a school like this?"" or ""It's bad that the new girls arrive in coffins."" Or ""There should be parents in this movie,"" then you are missing the point. This movie is an allegory as well as a conceit and it requires the symbolism of dreams to speak eloquently and to honestly explore its issues. With no doctrinaire adult character to ""set things right,"" this movie is free to honestly portray childhood itself while it intentionally avoids preaching about what adults think childhood ought to be.

Second, ""Innocence"" is a reverent rhapsody on life as it is experienced directly by the senses: sight, sound, touch, smell and taste. It explores the life of the body. In connection, the cinematography is beautiful, vibrant and sumptuous  with saturated colors and natural lighting. If you liked ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" and ""The New World,"" you will like ""Innocence."" If you strongly prefer Hollywood-style movies with their clear narrative story lines; familiar content and tone; stock characters; and readily identifiable messages such as ""drugs can destroy your life, if you abuse them,"" you will be frustrated or perhaps angered by this film.

I also suggest if you have a strong aversion to the sight of the human body, you avoid this movie. Because ""Innocence"" is about the senses and the life of the body, it must acknowledge the fact that girls have bodies  that they are not just clothes, spirit and thought. Nudity means ""being without any clothing,"" and there is only one very brief nude scene in this movie, in which a girl gets out of the bathtub and looks at herself in the mirror, evaluating her arrival at puberty. If you sneeze, you will miss the nudity, so I'm not sure why some reviewers on the internet whine about ""constant nudity."" Furthermore, this nude scene is honest, thoroughly wholesome and entirely age-appropriate. There's no doubt in my mind that every girl and boy who's ever taken baths in a room with a mirror has done this same self-appraisal at some point while growing up. There are also some swimming scenes involving semi-nude girls, but these are pleasant and innocent. Since they are partially clothed, the girls are not even skinny-dipping in the true sense of the word, as many children throughout the world actually do. Any viewer who was taught, ""The body is the temple of the soul,"" or who remembers skinny-dipping as a kid or is familiar with the human body as a worthwhile subject in over 3000 years of Greco-Judeo-Christian Art should be fine with the mere semi-nudity in this film.

Regarding some reviewers accusing film-maker Lucile Hadzihalilovic of making child pornography, such accusations are irresponsible, false and slanderous  most likely the result of sloppy thinking, misinformation or hysteria. Nothing  and I mean **nothing**  sexually explicit occurs in this movie and all the behavior of the characters is age-appropriate. If you're looking for a special, poignant film, check this one out.",1386460800,11,3591,5.052364864864865
2444914,3,B000BX6FW8,"I don't recommend this copy of the film and not necessarily the film either. About the disk...The video quality was not as good as it should have been. About the film... It;s one of those art type films. The story line isn't real clear and it seems a little dark to me ,but it does kinda get you thinking and the artistry is good as far as the imagery (cinematography) goes anyway. There are some brief scenes where the girls are in their underwear, so if that offends you, don't watch it. However , if you love film art, this might be a good one for you.",1385942400,3,555,4.196261682242991
2444915,5,B000BX6FW8,"Unforgettable re-imagining of a surreal private French girls' school

2444917,2,B000BX6FW8,being a celebrity nude hound and sort of a perv this movie wasn't what I exspected at all . not a good film to buy. and to be honest to you I don't even remember it. so it must not have impressed me.,1363737600,3,199,3.6511627906976742
2444918,5,B000BX6FW8,"Maybe it's something about the French. This film, and ""Ponette"", rank with me as the loveliest, truest cinematic works dealing with childhood.

(Well, I should add that men might not feel that way, since both films deal with little girls -- I am interested to know what male lovers of cinema would vote for.)

Aesthetically, this is a first-rate film, from its highly stylized, deliberately old-fashioned opening to its purposefully abrupt end at the fountain. I watched this in complete absorption before watching the interviews with the charming Lucile Hadzihalilovic, and I am in complete agreement with her choices regarding filming and soundtrack. As she intended, mood is set by the interesting visuals, but there is no Hollywood-style musical score guiding the viewer's emotional response.

Ms. Hadzihalilovic intended the story to be open to interpretation, but although one might quibble over details, I don't see how anyone could see this as anything other than a poetic, psychological interpretation of the voyage from young girlhood to sexual maturity. In this it is accurate, moving, and beautiful. As Hadzihalilovic intended, it is like a fairytale and a dream, something to which every viewer can bring her own experience.

I am always impressed with directors who can work with young children. This director gets a naturalistic performance from her little girls, which is more than any recent American movie I can remember could boast of. As a girl who grew up in the '70s and '80s, I remember girls at single-sex schools dressed in uniform, jumping rope and playing with hula hoops, and the director gets more than that -- she gets the feel of being a little girl in that kind of environment. As she herself notes, in real life, the girls would have been crueler to each other. True, but no matter -- she gets the gentler side of it right.

Some have described this movie as being somehow perverted. I disagree. It is our jaded modern view that would incline someone to see this. I think this beautiful film lives up to its name and shows innocence, a good and lovely thing, with darkness around the edges. Like life.",1349222400,24,2134,4.933147632311978
2444929,5,B000BX6FW8,"Fantastic and beautiful movie that is definitely not for everyone.  The DVD is wonderful quality, though if ever there was a film that deserved a Blu Ray release it'd be this one.  Highly recommended all around, for those who can deal with vague and eerie movies that don't fully explain themselves and , in my humble opinion, don't need to.  Everyone I know who's seen this movie has taken something different away from it.",1332979200,3,424,4.702702702702703
2444930,1,B000BX6FW8,I would rate this zero star if not one. Not worth a cent and would never recommend this movie. Can I have my money back?,1324944000,,120,3.84
2444931,5,B000BX6FW8,"This is a beautiful film.  The storyline is open to your own interpretation. I watched this over a week ago and I cannot stop thinking of different possible answers, yet the storyline isn't that complicated. I loved the actors, for such a young age, they all did an excellent job. This film is set in a park with lots of beautiful green scenery.

There is a suspenseful and dark tone to this film like something awful is going to happen, however, the end result is something that I didn't expect. I loved the eerie feel of the outdoor wall lights attached to the trees along the path that the older girls walked on at night. My favorite scene is when the schoolgirls are dancing, swinging, and playing in the forest with classical music in the background, it really reminded me of my childhood, where you simply enjoyed playing with no drama or tension. If you like slow and thoughtful movies, give it a try.",1317859200,17,908,4.530487804878049
2444932,4,B000BX6FW8,"The great Robert Bresson always regreted the films had to be accompained by words. He regarded them useless, since the cinema is strictly a visual art.

I bring up this previous comment, because Innocence is a film that easily could do without the words. The visuals talk by themselves, the beauty of nature confronted with the isolation from the outer world around these little girls who are forced to abandon their team once they reach 12, with a violet ribbon on her hair.

Its intimate style prefigures a minimalist portrait about the dreams, hopes and vanished illusions of this bunch of little girls who are brought up without feelings under the most strict rules of obedience and severe discipline.

The final is opened, leaving it to us to judge and meditate. Superb photography despite its slow paced rhtym.

Marion Cotillard once more chews the scenery.",1311120000,4,863,4.931034482758621
2444933,4,B000BX6FW8,"I happened upon this film on YouTube last week and rented it from Netflix.
  This is a film about an exclusive private boarding ballet school in an English speaking country that could nevertheless be, and most likely is, found in many nations of the world, especially the Russian Federation, where people are passionate about ballet as they are nowhere else. The cost of educating and training this small group of girls in the basic academic arts and dance is offset by the revenues of recitals the girls put on periodically at an old opera house nearby. Since the fate of the school is tied completely to the success of the recitals, the shows must please their demanding audiences: the girls must not only dance perfectly but look like angels, maintaining perfect figures dressed in white. They are permitted to roam the extensive grounds of their school so long as they do not leave.
  That ballet companies can be unforgiving with the rare people suited to their art and that the perfectionism demanded by many dance teachers has driven many students to depression, anorexia, and suicide are cliches. The girls at this school know they cannot leave, so they do not dwell on the injustices meted out by their teachers, but all but the most beautiful and successful entertain fantasies about leaving that often surface as nightmares. Those who act out these fantasies meet differing outcomes.
  Although sequestering girls away from males may be necessary to to enable some of them to dance without embarrassment or fear, it is the rare girl that is willing to forego knowledge for the privilege. When the girls run away, it is with the audience's understanding and approval. The prettiest and most talented, on the other hand, find protection at the school and become the school's leaders, knowing they are too young to handle the many attentions of boys they would be sure to meet ""outside"". When they finally undergo puberty, these ""survivors"" are taken to the nearby city and neatly deposited at a city fountain, where their unselfconscious willingness to splash in white dresses up to their underwear inevitably draws the attention of boys nearby, who will now teach them about love at precisely the moment when love is most magical and sublime. The system works, but only for the elite: those patient enough to wait out the long ordeal.
  Let's be as clear about the film as the film is trying to be clear about girls: This movie is not pornography by any stretch. There is no nudity or sex whatsoever, and shots of girls dressing for ballet or playing on the lawn lack all manner of prurience. This is a film about what it feels like to be a girl on the cusp of adolescence, before hormones make them ""boy crazy"". What it feels like, more than anything else, is warm and scared and companionable. There are, in fact, no males on this campus, nor need there be, since the film makes clear that girls of this age do not understand sexual differentiation and, what's more, do not care to.
  ""Innocence"" often drags, much as childhood often drags, but it is a visually beautiful film united by a handful of appropriate motifs, water for libido, snow for chastity and purity, rare color for the few reminders of time and aging the girls live with. A riveting film it is not; a sincere and sometimes clinical exploration of feminine coming of age it most certainly is, with the appeal of music and ballet thrown in.
  BTW there is really only one fantastic aspect in the film, but it is easily explained and completely in agreement with the film's theme: the girls leave and arrive in coffins. In light of the above it should be obvious what this conceit means: these girls must be ""dead"" to the sexuality within them for as long as they remain there; their sexuality is directed not to members of the opposite gender but to their ballet's audience. This sexual numbness may be especially common to children raised only among members of their own sex. In its celebration of the grace and beauty of youth, ""Innocence"" calls for a new era of sublimation of youthful sexual energies, specifically dance, while acknowledging that such sublimation may be impossible and even undesirable for all but the most beautiful and talented of young people among us.",1263600000,73,4254,4.7806539509536785
2444934,5,B000BX6FW8,"There have been a number of interpretations about this film.  I guess the important thing is to contribute...  Anyway, soon after it was over, I had the same feeling that overtook me during it's entirety, which was uncertainty.  It took almost one day for the meaning of it to permeate through my mind and help me discern what was being shown.  I truly dismiss any claims pertaining to lewd or inappropriate images... whatever abstract version of reality was being amplified, it drew me in perfectly.  It was a very powerful allegory of modern life.  Freedom is  a myth, that's common-place.  However, we continue to live one day after the next as if there weren't strings controlling our movements.  We play within our confines.  Such is this movie... there are walls, there is a hierarchy, discipline is enforced.  They arrive at a young age, albeit in a coffin (already deceased).  And they dance... Perfection is not demanded of them, the act is the goal.  As the oldest girls move across the stage every night, the shadows of the spectators loom in the background as demons foreseeing perverse omens...  Very poignant.  I guess people lose their innocence early on in life, more and more prematurely in an exponential fashion, especially in this western hyperactive, hypersexual environment we have created.  But I guess the damaged minds of the ones overseeing our children are the true monsters... no matter how secluded and whisked away the upbringing may take place, there is no escape from the wretched mold children are shaped with... they dance, and the genuine innocence in their actions is oblivious to what they are inexorably being groomed to become, even if it is only suggested in the subtext of the film.  As we view the chronology of their time in this alternative reality, all becomes clear.  However, seeing purity in its quintessential form, and then its slow death at the hands of those who are blind to its light, can become quite unbearable.  Anyway, I recommend this film (not that my recommendation means anything), if for no other reason than to show us a mirror of the running-towards-the-mousetrap philosophy reigning over our world, perpetuating our frustrations by psychotic projective identification, murdering off the beauty of future generations as if it would erase our own erroneous undertakings throughout our insipid existence.",1254787200,13,2367,5.054123711340206
2444935,5,B000BX6FW8,"Like the very best gothic fairy tales, the film submerges us in an innovative, surreal aesthetic that evokes coming of age. The startling imagery (watery expanses alternately placid and violent, blood-bright ribbons and whitest uniforms) and cryptic but highly suggestive narrative hover between beauty and menace, embroidering a delicate, deadly spiderweb ambience. The shimmering magic and terrors of childhood and pubescence, which coil just beneath consciousness, are given phantasmatic form in sequences that suggest the permeability of boundaries we'd prefer to think staunch. Safety and danger, innocence and perversion, bodily resilience and fragility, nature's loveliness and destructiveness all bleed into each other. Is the girls' school a nurturing haven or site of sinister machinations? Will the ""outside"" proffer the escape into liberty or unnameable new horrors? How can we understand ""birth"" and ""death"", is the coffin from which new arrivals spring also a sort of womb, are new life stages necessarily also a deathly adieu to what came before, a rite initiated in blood? For what are the best girls ""chosen,"" and is that good or bad? The unforgettable sequence in which the preteen butterflies are ushered through an enormous grandfather clock to dance for an audience that we gradually discern comprises older male figures is appalling in the most subtle of ways, staging the dangers and vulnerable joys that beat, intertwined, at the heart of female pubescence. Reverberations of Angela Carter, Brothers Quay, Peter Weir, Brothers Grimm, Lewis Carroll, yes, but there's an idiosyncratic, chilling yet oddly uplifting magic all its own here.",1219795200,10,1660,5.539370078740157
2444936,4,B000BX6FW8,"German expressionist writer Frank Wedekind's symbolist novella ""Mini-Haha: The Corporal Education of Young Girls"" (1888) is the basis for this film, directed by Lucile Hadzihalilovic.  It takes place in a girls' school for affluent students, who arrive in a coffin, one by one, and who are not allowed to leave. (Anyone who tries to leave has to stay there forever, and become one of the old women who are servants to the current girls.) Marion Cotillard plays one of the two teachers, Eva, a ballet teacher; she is often moved to tears. The other teacher is a science teacher, who has a limp.  The girls are always dressed in white. Is this beginning to sound like a dream sequence to you? The girls wear colored ribbons to denote their seniority; some of the older girls are eventually taken by train to a city, presumably (but never guess outcome in a dream) to attend another school.  The film is admirably discussed on the DVD in two interviews with the director, who declines to ""explain"" what is happening here. Suffice it to say that this film does not respect chronology or explanation.  Like other of Wedekind's works, it exists, and was created, to be absorbed rather than ""understood,"" much as looking at a great painting is assisted by the viewer's openhearted acceptance of the effort.  Not for everyone, but an interesting look at Cotillard's choices in her early career -- how the girls' freedom is always tinged with the oppressiveness of their days.  Cotillard has a great line: ""Obedience is the only path to happiness.""  Perhaps Wedekind was remarking on the way children were raised in his day.  Perhaps the director is remembering her days growing up in an oppressive country in the l960s. It's all up to the viewer.",1209945600,14,1738,4.808724832214765
2444937,2,B000BX6FW8,"""Innocence"" is a freak show.

The setting is apparently some sort of school, although that is a term to be applied very loosely.  It's a semi-penitentiary; all girls, each neophyte arrives in an elaborate (and locked) wooden coffin.  There is a large starburst immediately over the (unconscious) child's face, covered in mesh wire, so the girl can respire.

Each novice is then introduced to the routine of her new prison-like existence by the established girls.  Each ""year"" (reinforcing the school idea) wears an identifying color of hair ribbons.  The classes the young ladies take are divided into biology/nature studies and dance.  And dance.
And more dance.

It seemed to me this institution was a repressive ballet academy for young girls.  Tyros are admitted at age six, such as Iris, the newbie whose story makes the central thread of this film.  The departure age (I won't say ""graduating"" because there's hardly any kind of accuracy there) seems to be around fourteen.

Several elderly ladies minister to the daily needs of the charges but their roles are very minimal.  The two instructors are Mlle. Eva (Marion Cotillard) and Mlle. Edith (Helene de Fougerolles), both younger women;
Eva seems to struggle with the harshness of the daily regime while Edith apparently bears no such compunction.

Iris asks repeatedly when she can return to her little brother.  The answer:  ""IT IS FORBIDDEN"".  This is the reply to most questions, such as ""When can I leave?""  ""Why can't we play in the woods?"" and ""Why can't I stop dancing""?

Another young girl--Laura--who was admitted at the same time as Iris, determinedly makes her escape.  Despite the enormous, ivy-clad walls surrounding the ""campus"" of the dreary, run-down building, there is also a lake.  Mysterious, forboding gurgling noises (like water in a rushing stream) mark the film's opening scenes.  What the deeper symbolism of the creepy confluential cacophony is supposed to mean escapes me completely...

Brave little Laura lights out in a small boat, witnessed by Iris, who declines to accompany her.  Laura makes it several hundred yards into the body of water when she (rather resignedly) notices the craft is leaking.
In the next scene, Mlle. Eva somberly informs her pupils (she is the dance teacher) that Laura will never be seen again and that they will hold a ritual in her honor.

And then they burn her--in another coffin, this one sans breathing-hole--
on an immense funeral pyre.

The viewer's foremost questions regarding this fable are 1) what kind of ""school"" is this?  2)  where do the girls come from and where are their families?  and  3)  who is the ""headmistress""?

Once a year, Headmistress comes to visit and has a special recital put on for her benefit.  If she selects a girl, the student leaves the school with the Headmistress, never to be seen or heard from again.  One poor student, believing she has a chance of being selected (and hence taken away), meets with crushing disappointment.  Headmistress carefully examines each girl, even so far as asking to peer into her mouth (like someone choosing a thoroughbred!).

At some point, each class is promoted to ""the theatre"", where they perform their dance routines for live audiences shrouded in shadows.
Once each performing class meets some kind of criteria, they are shuttled out of the school via a bizarre underground subway and into Paris.
There they are enrolled in a ""real world"" dance school for high-school age enrollees.

""Innocence"" is a movie I have seen billed as SUSPENSE.  THRILLER.  MYSTERY.  Etc.  I cannot say I find these descriptives useful.  It is indeed freakish--there are just so many aspects of the tale left unexplained.

Still, it embodies the off-the-wall idiosyncratic flavor I enjoy in foreign films and it was certainly intriguing.  Just don't sit down to this one expecting every oddity to be given a decent excuse...",1205712000,12,3896,5.0124804992199685
