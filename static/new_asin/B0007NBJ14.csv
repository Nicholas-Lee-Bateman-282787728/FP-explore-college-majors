2223294,4,B0007NBJ14,"This was the closing film at the 2002 Tokyo International Film Festical. Yoshimura Kanichiro, ""the wolf of Mibu"", who toils through the end of the Shogunate era armed only with his sense of justice.

I have owned this movie for some time now and never tire of watching it again to pick out details of the story I had missed before. I find it has a rich mixture of sights and sounds that make it a story worth repeating. The characters are believeable and full of emotion. The action is well played.

2223321,2,B0007NBJ14,"I think I expected more, something along the likes of Zatoichi, even the remake.  But no, despite the story, the acting and effects and most of all, the samurai fighting is just plain bad.  There are so many samurai films that do justice to this royal art (the recent Zatoichi film is just one of many).  But perhaps the budget or timing was off and unfortunately, it shows.  Best to forget this film and jump forward to another more relevant tale of samurai history (even the ancient Shogun with Richard Chamberlain provided more of a background).",1457395200,,548,4.677083333333333

2223352,5,B0007NBJ14,"This is a movie that I will never tire of.  From the acting to the fighting choreography, everything in this movie is top notch.  While I agree with other past reviewers that this and ""The Last Samurai"" are similar in general story line, I must point out what to me, makes  ""When the Last Sword is Drawn"" better.  While Ken Watanabes' portrayal of Katsumoto was very enjoyable, I feel that Kiichi Nakais' Kanichiro Yoshimura was more real.  Listening to Kanichiro describing his home land of Nambu Morioka or his moving speech near the end of the movie, you feel as if you are listening to Kanichiro himself.

Overall a very very enjoyable movie. You will not be disappointed if you watch it.",1444867200,,692,4.631147540983607

2223359,5,B0007NBJ14,"One of the most realistic Japanese movies I have ever seen, with solid character development and acting.  Not only was the fighting well wrought, but extraordinarily accurate (from a foreigners perspective) to the sword style of the time.  However, what I consider the real praise, is this film moved me many times during it's course.  I will watch it again.",1443139200,,358,4.933333333333334

2223361,5,B0007NBJ14,"Very well done, beautiful camera work and very well scripted, acted and directed.  A touching story, very much a parable.  The main character is almost like a samurai Messiah in a violent and confusing era (end of Tokugawa, start of Meiji) where old certainties were being destroyed.  And for chanbara fans there is plenty of swordplay (as there was in the historical events upon which the film is based).
You might say that the film suffers from some of the conventions of the  (historical drama) genre, but on the other hand those conventions are part of the genre and in this case they are well controlled and well integrated.
The film assumes some knowledge on the part of the audience; before viewing, I suggest reading a bit on the Boshin War and the Shinsengumi.  Good overview on JapanReference dot com; also Wikipedia.",1442880000,,827,4.795774647887324

2223363,5,B0007NBJ14,"This moving and powerful saga takes place during the Meiji Restoration. Capturing the sense of the transformation from ancient bushido to honor in modern Japan this film brought me to tears. It steals up on you, beginning as simple story of a swordmaster in the Tokugawa shogunate who become entwined in the divided loyalties between Emperor and shogunate. Sword fighting takes the back seat to human drama as we see the lifelong subtext of the tension between Kanichiro Yoshimura, the miserly samurai, Hajime Saito, the world-hating master swordsman embittered against humanity, and Jiroemon Ono, the low class orphan adopted into a noble family, faced with the ultimate choices between childhood friendship and duty to his clan. This epic tale echoes the wistful transition of Lara in Dr. Zhivago to Soviet Russia as Mitsu is the child who is born to the Shogunate but must exist in the gun-wielding demon world of modern Japan, fortified by the love beyond measure of an absent father.",1441929600,,988,5.067484662576687

Told from different perspectives and flashbacks this award winning film looks at the conflicting roles of family, clan, loyalty, and most importantly love transcending adversity and the sacrifices one individual, Yoshimura Kanichiro,  will undertake to ensure his family doesn't starve to death, even if it means violating many of the samurai rules of behavior. Towards the end of the film, this least likely protagonist shows what true courage is, what it means to be a samurai with his deep love of his homeland and family;  and all this is mixed with some very brutal but realistic sword play.",1439856000,2,792,5.124031007751938

2223389,5,B0007NBJ14,"This is a story about a father's love for his family, his friends, and his country.  It's full of depth and as we watch characters unravel or develop throughout the story.  Our image of samurai are serious killers.  When we first see Kiichi, the main character, he appears to be a simpleton who seems out of place with his smiles, happy-go-lucky attitude and full of greed.  His nemesis tells most of the story as he describes a man.  In the first 5 minutes, his nemesis states ""I decided then that I will kill this guy"".  (I didn't pay attention to the subtitles as they are often badly written).  Only to discover that he is able to defend himself against his attack and gains his respect.  As the history unfolds and he had to choose sides, Kiichi has to make a decision on his alliance as series of events lead to flashbacks of his memory that unravels his true character.  Most people try to compare this to the Last Samurai.  Where as that movie was about a character discovering his inner self, this movie is about us learning that being a samurai isn't just about fighting for your honor but being a provider for the family.  This isn't a story about loyalty or fighting for the bigger cause.  It's about a man who only wants to kill out of love for his family and country and hides his pain behind his smiles.",1433980800,2,1318,4.423236514522822

Told in flashback format, it depicts the conflicted and perfectly samurai embodiment of Yoshimura, an ideal samurai and family man in every aspect living in a very imperfect world; even as other samurai and individuals are challenged and begin to deteriorate, Yoshimura maintains his samurai idealism to the very end even as an ultimate sacrifice to these principals to his beloved family.

2223404,3,B0007NBJ14,"This is a solid, enjoyable movie. Other reviewers have offered the plot summary, which are straight forward and accurately descriptive. There were certain weaknesses in the storyline that keep me from grading it more highly. I thought that the story jumped from past to present in a rather herky-jerky fashion, not cleanly distinguishing the two. As a character, Kanichiro Yoshimura (played by Kiichi Nakai) is enjoyable, but not compelling and does not involve you deeply into his life or predicament. Since he is the center of the story, the success of the movie rests squarely on his shoulders and, for me, he does not deliver enough to draw me in.

Others have compared the movie to The Last Samurai, but I can not since I believe they are two altogether different movies. The Last Samurai is more westernized to accommodate Tom Cruise and his character. Last Sword is purely Japanese (in a good way) and can best be appreciated when looked at from that cultural standpoint. Still, I believe there is no comparison between Kiichi Nakai and Ken Watanabe as actors, with the latter head and shoulders above Nakai. Watanabe is instantly noble, strong, wise, and gifted as Katsumoto. You do not feel for Nakai until his last speech and by then you are two hours into the movie.

I was also unimpressed with the swordplay. Having immersed myself early in my samurai movie experience with Takashi Shimura, Seiji Miyaguchi in The Seven Samurai or Toshiro Mifune in Yojimbo (or any of his Samurai movies) and others, I was not impressed with the skills of any of the actors, especially Koich Sato (playing Hajime Saito).

The performances from the actors was top notch, camera handling and action scenes were like straight out of a Hollywood production.

I would not compare this movie to being like The Last Samurai in any way. I like The Last Samurai and it's one of my favorite movies. But The Last Samurai didn't make me cry for 30 minutes straight at the ending..... That being said, just watch this movie. I guarantee you will not be disappointed even in the least.

This is a brilliant tale of selflessness and self sacrifice amidst a very dangerous time and one man's resolve to stand against all odds for the sake of his family and honor.

2223455,5,B0007NBJ14,"This film truly explains the pressure a Samurai was under to fulfill his obligations to family, liege lord, governor, and royal family.  Yoshimura is the typical samurai, until he makes a decision to leave his home and family to fight for the Shogun, who he feels is the appropriate governor of Japan.  By leaving his village, he becomes outcast, and his family is shunned.

A lucky break results in him gaining employment in the Shoguns' guard, and he begins to make a little money.  Through cunning instinct, he turns his small pittance into income he can use to support his family, who are suffering in the village since no one will help them.

Yoshimura shows the exact, unbending character of the real Samurai.  Even with the events in Japan turning against him, he must do what he thinks is right.  Are all samurai the same?  The film shows us they were not, with some few hiding during battle, or taking money for the wrong reasons.

This film is dark, you should know that going in.  Yoshimuras' character however, and the lovely scenes of Japanese friendship and loyalty offset the darkness, and have you cheering for him.  This is a serious Japanese cut 'em up movie, and if you have an aversion to blood and violence, it may not be for you.

Although I was able to figure out the ending of this film after just a few minutes of watching, it did not detract from the interest of the story itself.  To visit with a class of people up close and personal was well worth the effort.  I am sure I missed some of the Kiichi Nakai message amongst all the action and storylines this first viewing, but am looking forward to seeing it again, it is THAT good.",1410825600,2,1659,4.505016722408027

Loaded with drama since the very start, this movie entails more than just swords fighting and envelops the true Samurai living of the times. The everyday tasks are there, the simplest of manners of what being a Samurai entailed for so many men of low caste.

This is the story of one Samurai and the people that came in touch with him and those same he left his mark embedded.

It follows the true grit of the turmoil that Japan lived in those trying years. The politics are but a backdrop to the reality of what trying to live was at the time. There's no larger than life hero or the Herculean acts of a character larger than others. True skills of the sword and mastery of staying alive for the sole aim of providing for their loved ones.

The extinction of samurai was emotional for Japanese for they chose to embrace westernization. However, the samurai spirit lived on. The whole world saw it from the kamikazes. ""Saito is alive because no one has killed him, while Yoshimura kills because he wants to stay alive""? Come on, samurai lives to serve, to kill and to earn glory and honors for their masters. Yoshimura's agonizing minutes (feels like half hour) at the end is way too much sissy Hollywood. Hara-kiri is a sacred ritual, an honor and an art - they don't bother to show it? And his seppuku is even ordered by his formal master. How pathetic that is.

The true samurai only lives in the fantasy movies like the one I just watched - Ashura.

My 2 stars give to 2 women in the play, Yoshimura's wife and Saito's mistress who show characters of true samurai. Is it ironic? Perhaps not. Female is usually the actual alpha male in virtually all races.",1389225600,,1067,4.5811518324607325

This is a traditional Samurai epic drama in the truest form, so if you're looking for non-stop blood-n-guts action, you should move on.

The only similarity is that both stories are set in Japan during the time that rifles and cannon are replacing the sword as weapon(s) of choice.

The principle character (Yoshimura) in When the Last Sword is Drawn is a trained swordsman, a samurai . . . and Japanese . . .

Both ""The Last Sword"" and ""Hidden Blade"" are almost a throw back to Japanese movies made on the eve of WWII where self-sacrifice and duty were constantly stressed.

That said, I enjoy samurai lore and the best of what the bushido code could represent. I've read Musashi's ""Book of Five Rings"" (on the philosophical side of things) and enjoy ""silly"" Miike action-style Japanese films (on the gonzo action side). I thought that the Last Samurai came really close to being a great movie. After reading the top review here from Lawrence Bernabo, I streamed this movie on Prime Instant.

Takita directs a great movie. If you want a great film, the narrative device sets up a very compelling story that is revealed bit by bit (no spoilers here). If you want a samurai action movie, that's here too. I felt that Last Samurai cheesed it up a bit a with the long slow motion shots of Tom Cruise, but this movie strikes a similar balance of action, drama, character development, and solid plot while taking the material seriously enough to deliver a respectable, earnest experience. The time period of the settig is also at the height of drama in Japanese history, when sword making had reached its zenith and as the samurai/shogunate culture was peaking and only just beginning to show fractures before its final downward collapse.

The incredible sense of loss and continuing doom coupled with glimpses of hope.  Historically accurate, it traces the last days of the Japanese Shogunate. Our main characters are part of a mercenary Samurai group sworn to protect and enforce the will of the Shogun. In the 1860's Japan is on the cusp of major changes as a way of life almost 400 years old is about to come to an end. We get a deep glimpse into the creed that is the Samurai. Whose life is governed by a rigid set of rules. The tension is created as our main hero struggles between the love for his family and the life shaped by being a Samurai.

I was expecting a latter day Kurasawa film but nothing could be further from the truth.  This film contains a certain degree of action but it is a really a meditative piece on the Samurai code.  We commonly view the Japanese samurai ethos as death before dishonor.  In a modern twist this film turns that assumption on it's head by espousing the preciousness of self-preservation and life.  ""When the Last Sword is Drawn"" is a deliberately paced film that takes it's time to explore it's themes and ambitious viewers will be greatly rewarded.",1244937600,3,657,4.719298245614035
2223551,3,B0007NBJ14,"A story about a samurai who leaves him homeland in ""disgrace"" but as he finds favorable conditions working for another Lord he sends his profits back home to his family. He happens to live at an end of an era, where there will be no more need for samurai. He never becomes conflicted on what he should do; he being a true Bushido disciple, his choice clear, to completely fulfill his duty which knowingly leads to his death.

The premise of the story is: man's duty is as important as his familiar obligations but it is through our relationships with others is how we survive physical death and are remembered.

First so you understand my problem is not the movie's length...it was the lack of focus in the story. By shortening and tightening up the script the movie would have been far better. The movie turned into melodrama. The protagonist's morality, motivation, and sentiments could of been more strongly established in beginning of the film. Instead it wasn't, so I had to watch multiple scenes (and numerous minutes of video) that fumbled around in getting to that point which showed showed us what kind of man he was. Quite simply, there was too much story! The movie served more to showcase the director's and actor's ability than what it's supposed to do: tell it's story...

Personally, I disliked the protagonist's lengthy and personal death scene; it somehow ended up feeling ""pornographic"". Greatest of all complaints is the music, the music was comical. Here you have whats supposed to be important and tense fight scenes and the music is something out of Tom and Jerry! The battle-fight scenes themselves were ok, nothing special to note (the duels were far better though).

2223554,5,B0007NBJ14,"WHEN THE LAST SWORD IS DRAWN (a.k.a. Mibu Gishi Den) is a moving chambara film directed by Yojiro Takita. The film once again occurs during the Meiji Period, a fascinating time for the samurai lifestyle. Films such as Yoji Yamada's samurai trilogy (which I have reviewed before) and even Tom Cruise's ""The Last Samurai"" have portrayed the plight of the Japanese warrior during the closing years of this period. The aforementioned films have examined the impact of the Western influence upon the code of Bushido, the warrior's code slowly gives way to a changing world, where explosive modern ammunition takes the place of forged steel. MIBU GISHI DEN also explores these factors, but at the same time matches its protagonist against unstoppable forces of nature such as famine, unrest such as civil warfare and the development of industry.

The story begins in the city of Tokyo 1889. Hajime Saito (Koichi Sato)is an old man who brings his sick grandson to the town doctor, Chiaki Ono (Takehiro Murata). Ono is in the middle of moving, and while his wife tends to Saito's grandson, Ono entertains Saito with a cup of tea. As they engage in conversation, they find that their lives are connected by a samurai named Kanichiro Yoshimura.

Kanichiro Yoshimura (Kiichi Nakai) is a samurai family man who no longer has the resources to provide for his wife and his children due to low wages paid by his small clan. Reluctantly, he packs up and leaves his loved ones behind so he can make a higher earning in the city, under the well-known clan of Shinsen-gumi. Yoshimura hopes that he will make a better life for his family as a retainer in this faction during one of the most tumultuous times in Japanese history.

This film will not attain its recognition with awesome swordplay choreography. While there are scenes of warfare, a few swordplay sequences dispersed through the proceedings, and it does have the most realistic beheading I've ever seen, ""When the Last Sword is drawn"" will be remembered for its engaging story line. The intertwining narrative about the life of another petty samurai may have been explored before in Yoji Yamada's trilogy, and it does have the usual samurai ideals of loyalty and camaraderie, family and commitment, Yoshimura's life is seen through the eyes of two men and makes for very moving screenplay. The two perspectives go back and forth, as Ono recounts Yoshimura's past as a sensei in the Oshu clan and Saito reminisces about Yoshimura's later life as an eccentric samurai who is often criticized for his money-making schemes in the Shinsen-gumi clan. It is a very effective approach as the timelines unravel in an emotionally moving manner, the storytelling is set up so that each moment of Yoshimura's life will impact the viewer to an emotional degree. From Yoshimura and Saito's rivalry to their developing friendship, to the courtship of Shizu (Yui Natsukawa), the scenes are a very effective rendering on the perseverance and fortitude of Yoshimura, which is executed beautifully with simple precision.

The film's lush cinematography is aided by the moving music and the wonderful screenplay by Takehiro Nakajima, but the emotional impact is mostly carried by the lead actor; Kiichi Nakai. Director Takita has chosen the right actor to play Yoshimura as his performance borders on emotional poetry. Takita's direction is excellent but some scenes have the dangerous potential to be a little heavy-handed and too melodramatic. Thankfully, Nakai's performance manages to find the proper flow in the sequences that it becomes very moving and full of impact. I can almost guarantee that the last quarter of the film will definitely water the eyes, as Nakai's performance in his final scene is awe-inspiring.

""When the Last Sword is Drawn"" is a character-driven chambara period film that gives a focused and captivating look at the last days of the samurai. The film is a very nice companion piece to Yoji Yamada's chambara trilogy* and is a ""hidden gem"" all by itself. The film is truly a wonderful and unforgettable piece of Japanese film-making in the wide annals of great samurai films. Capturing the raw spirit established by Kurosawa, this film is a rare treat for samurai aficionados. I have definitely become a fan of Kiichi Nakai and look forward to see more of Yojiro Takita's work.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  Stars]

2223558,5,B0007NBJ14,"Comparing American-made The Last Samurai to Japan's When the Last Sword is Drawn is like comparing a Junior High School play to a great Broadway production.  There is no comparison.  Tom Cruise vs. Kichi Nakai?  Please -- It's laughable and insulting to Nakai.  Kichi Nakai gives the performance of a lifetime playing Kanichiro Yoshimura, the country samurai whose first and only responsibility is feeding his family amidst a famine which has struck his beloved homeland.

Yoshimura faces disgrace and banishment from his clan because he dares leave his homeland to find work to keep his family from starving to death.  The jobs he takes are distasteful to him and morally wrong, but he is driven by his desire to take care of his family.  Every little bit of money he earns, he sends back to them.  He is made fun of because of his constant drive to earn more money for his family and is thought to be a weird samurai who does not understand the true nature of being a samurai.

This attitude is especially expressed by fellow samurai Saito who hates his quirky country samurai ways so much that he tries to kill Yoshimura.  However, Yoshimura quickly reinforces his unparalleled swordsmanship, and Saito is put in his place rather quickly.  Still, Saito continues to hate Yoshimura and fails to understand Yoshimura's greatness until they (the Shinsengumi) are faced with certain defeat from the approaching Imperial Army.

The last thirty minutes of the movie are so emotional that I challenge anyone not to cry during Yoshimura's final speech.  This movie is so much more than a samurai movie.  It's about what kind of person each of us should strive to be.  Yoshimura is a perfect man in an imperfect world.  He is so good, so loyal, so dedicated, so courageous and so loving.  The movie is inspiring and must stand on it's own and never be compared to any other film -- because it is so superior in every way.  The story is told brilliantly and is approached from an angle not seen before.  The actors, most significantly of course -- Kichi Nakai -- are extraordinary.  Koichi Sato as Saito is at first darkly menacing.  However, later, because of his relationship with Yoshimura, he comes to know the true nature of what it is to be a real samurai. Sato's performance is so genuine and heart-felt that the viewer will also undoubtedly be deeply moved by his character.

In my opinion, this movie cannot be casually viewed.  In other words, I can't imagine a person watching this movie and then immediately going to the club or out shopping.  It's a movie to savor like a fine wine or a great piece of literature.  It's a wonderful movie and should be on everyone's must see list.",1188518400,96,2686,4.71244635193133

2223570,5,B0007NBJ14,"This is one of the best and most beautiful samurai movies I've ever seen. Around the end of the samurai regime (Tokugawa Shogunate) in the mid 19th Century, 'Shinsen-gumi' was formed. It was a group of specialy trained samurai and was mainly based in Kyoto, and was operating like the security police of the City, particularly targetted any attempt against the samurai regime of that time. Now the time has changed, in the early Meiji Period, soon after the samurai period, Japan was becoming westernised rapidly both socially and politically, and an old man, Saito, ex-Shinsen-gumi member, looks back over his past as a radical and ambitious samurai, and recalls his new Shinsen-gumi colleague from Northern Japan, Yoshimura, who had a very strong Northern accent. The story is about the life of Yoshimura, and the strong conflict that Saito's felt for Yoshimura.

I have a feeling that Tom Cruise's 'Last Samurai' is based on this kind of antagonism between the samurai and the new ruling power, although, strictly speaking, his movie was a mixture of modern, old and very old samurai world in Japan.  For this reason, to Japanese viewers or people who know the history of Japan well, it was a bit strange (but the story and photography were fantastic!).  But 'When The Last Sword Is Drawn' is very consistent in this sense, and shows a beautiful part as well as a brutal side of the samurai society of that particular time. It's purely Japanese which means that you may notice subtle details including the way 'kimono' is properly worn and ladies walk absolutely elegantly (unlike Memoirs of a Geisha!). This is a very cultural and historical film and an emotional rollercoaster! Enjoy it!",1182556800,49,1692,4.9298245614035086
2223571,5,B0007NBJ14,"My wife and I watched this together and found it to be a real tear-jerker. But then, we're ""sentimental slobs"" with old-fashioned values. This movie should be in a set with ""Twilight Samurai"" and Tom Cruise's ""Last Samurai."" They are all three about the same era, impoverished low-ranking samurai families hit by a famine in an era that no longer has much use for a feudal warrior class. But whereas ""Last Samurai"" and even ""Shogun"" with Richard Chamberlain can make you squirm in your seat because the Western foreigner's role in great events is overblown to the point of embarassment (as if the Japanese needed some ship-wrecked Westerner to manage their destiny), this movie does not play to foreign adventure fantasies. Don't get me wrong, adventure fantasies from James Bond in ""You Only Live Twice"" to Blackthorn in ""Shogun"" and Algren in ""Last Samurai"" are fun, they have their place, and I greatly enjoy them, but they have their limitations, too. Whereas ""Shogun"" and ""Last Samurai"" are about Westerners learning about Japanese chivalry, and we learn through their eyes, ""Last Sword"" shows modern Japanese what chivalrous behaviour is all about. There is a wide range of behavior, from great compassion, ""Profiles in Courage"" type integrity, and selfless love for family, contrasted by many examples of samurai not living up to their professed ideals. The sword fights are limited but riveting - it's mostly about character. Like knights in Western movies, samurai are often portrayed as giving lip-service to courageous integrity while acting as if they see honor as save face no matter what (what they call ""worldly pride"" or ""false pride"" in Sunday School). In this case, real integrity shines forth in a simple country ""hick,"" as is often the case.
  I wish this movie had come out before WWII, in which case more Japanese soldiers who committed suicide or submitted to beheading by their officers after losing battles in the Pacific would have found the higher courage to swallow an embarassing defeat in order to face up to the greater challenge of living and help their families get through post-war Japan and help re-build a healthy nation.
  And for the record, no one should be surprised that ""samurai"" means servant. Our Anglo-Saxon word knight is related to German Knecht, which means servant (as in vassal to a lord or king).  There is more in common here in our two cultures than is often appreciated.",1182297600,13,2424,4.9753086419753085
2223572,5,B0007NBJ14,"This is the third movie of this kind that I watched lately. I watched ""Hidden Blade"", ""The Twilight Samurai"" and finally ""When the Last Sword Is Drawn"". To me, ""the Last Sword"" was the most exciting, action packed movie of the three. There was lots of Samurai fighting which was beautifully choreographed. While the other two movies had great sword play at the end of the movies, ""The Last Sword"" had sword play from the beginning to almost the end.

The story is done through reminiscence of two charactors that had chance meeting. Although the story goes back and forth with the past and the present, it does not feel confusing.

For people who are not familiar with Japanese history, it may be helpful to learn a little about ""Shinsengumi"" before watching the movie. The movie does not really explain well what those warriors were doing at the time. Most Japanese are well informed about Shinsengumi so the director probably did not feel the need to do so. Wikipedia has entries for Shinsengumi and some of the main warriors in the group.

One item I noted that they made a mistake in the translation was when Shizu (the main charactor's wife) was walking in the river. The English caption made it sound as if the wife was trying to commit suicide, but she was actually trying to abort her unborn child. This method of walking in a cold river seems to have been a common way to abort a child in the region because there was another famous Japanese TV show that featured a charactor aborting a child this way.

Overall, this movie is a great show case of samurai spirit and the way of sword. I believe students of Kendo will enjoy watching this movie.",1176508800,8,1653,4.574324324324325
2223573,3,B0007NBJ14,"Yojiro Takita'a When the Last Sword is Drawn is a clear example of film I hate and at the same time love. Its a beautiful recreation of the conflict between the samurai ruling class and the emperor who fought in the late ninteenth century, focusing particularly on one group the Shinsengumi. Its not a gorefest action film but a nice epic drama focusing on two fictional characters, one man relating the fate of another years after that man has died.

In the end though despite what the film does good it negates itself at the end with a film that felt the need to put twenty extraneous minutes onto running time featuring characters who give big speeches before their deaths and relating in slow boring detail how those deaths effected other less interesting characters. It follows in the fate of films like Zodiac or Blood Diamond where the meat of the film is interesting but directors pad out length with nonsense that should have been cut out to streamline the running time. It detracts from the main plot without really offering anything of value or interest.

Which is a shame as production on the film is high. The writing is good offering a more realistic view of events portrayed in The Last Samurai. And actors Koichi Sato and Kiichi Nakai give great performances ranging from brutally dark and nicely humorous. Their performances highlight the writing fleshing out interesting characters but as I said all of this is somewhat burdened by an unwarranted length.

2223575,5,B0007NBJ14,"""When The Last Sword Is Drawn,"" is a highly recommended film. I just recently purchased this film, and was extremely impressed with it. The film is basically told in flashbacks. The year is 1899, and the Meiji Restoration is now over 30 years past. However, the film deals with the events leading up prior to the Meiji Restoration. The character Saito (Koichi Sato), who is now an old man, has come to visit a doctor with his sick grandchild in tow. Inside the Doctor's office is an old photograph of a samurai. And it here the film takes off. Saito notices that the samurai in the picture is a man named Kanichiro Yoshimura, whom he once knew during the tumultuous waning days of the Tokugawa era. As he looks at the picture, memories of a former time begin to flood him of his past as a member of the Shinsengumi.

For those who are not aware of the Shinsengumi, they were a small army of samurai who banded together to protect the Shogunate. They were not anti-imperialist, however, they did not want Japan to be opened to the West. Therefore, they sided with the Shogun. Their leader was named Isami Kondo. There have been countless films, books and plays of the Shinsengumi. They are well known in Japanese history. However, there was much treachery involved during their short tenure of policing Kyoto. They would later be betrayed by the Shogun. For those who want to know more, there is a film titled ""Shinsengumi: Assassins Of Honor,"" starring Toshiro Mifune that was released in 1970. It's a very good film.

Back to the story: Saito detested Kanichiro Yoshimura, because Yoshimura only fought for the money. His idea of being a samurai was not to die with honor, but according to him ""To Kill to Live."" The Doctor in the office also recollects on the man in the picture. It was his fathers friend, who was kicked out the clan because it was forbidden to leave the clan. This is a GREAT FILM. Yoshimura is truly talented with the sword. I do not wish to divulge too much, as this is one of the better samurai films out there. A truly great film. The character development in the film is outstanding, and the scenery of the film is breathtaking. Really great cinematography in this film.

History has long recorded the demise of the Tokugawa era, the fall of the Shogunate and the restoration of the Emperor. The Tokugawa Shogunate wanted to remain closed to the outside world and keep going along its old ways. This was in contrast to the Emperor, who wanted to open the nation to the West and lead Japan on a path of modernization. Saito and Yoshimura were both aligned with the Shogun being that they were both members of the Shinsengumi. The interaction between these two characters is great. Saito has his own demons to deal with in the film, and we see that he is not a virtuous man. And although Yoshimura fought for money, and not so much for his love of the Shinsengumi, his village is starving and he has a son and wife to feed.

This film does an excellent job as it gives a very good, and terrifically  developed character study of these two former members of the Shinsengumi. The films narrative moves at a slow and steady pace. If you have viewed the two recent films ""Twilight Samurai"" or ""The Hidden Blade"" then you will notice that although the film runs along much similar themes--this film is a notch well above the other two film. It really is that good. The characters are not as nuanced as they are in 'Twilight' or 'Hidden Blade' You see these men for what they are straight off the bat. Both are far removed from each other in terms of what knowing who they are. Therefore, if you have seen either of those two aforementioned films, then you won't be surprised with the films pace. I highly recommend the film, it is a worthy addition to your cinema collection. [Stars: 5]",1167523200,15,3805,4.540816326530612

2223579,5,B0007NBJ14,"It is probably inevitable that American audiences will compare ""Mibu gishi den"" (""When the Last Sword is Drawn"") with ""The Last Samurai,"" in that both films deal the Meiji restoration.  This is also a similarity between the two in that this 2003 Japanese film from director Yojiro Takita (""Komikku zasshi nanka iranai,"" ""Onmyoji"") also is concerned with a character learning the true meaning of being a samurai.  The difference is that instead of an American mercenary played by Tom Cruise it is a city samurai, Hajime Saito (Koichi Sato), who learns much from Kanichiro Yoshimura (Kiichi Nakai), who he dismisses at first meeting as a ""country"" samurai.

The story here is told mostly in flashback from the perspective of 1899 when Saito, now an old man, brings his ailing grandson to see a doctor.  In the home of the doctor there is an old photograph of a samurai that Saito recognizes, and the memories come flooding back to both the old man in the doctor (only the viewer is privy to both).  The two samurai first met during the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate, as clans were forced to choose between obedience to the Shogun, who wanted to maintain the old ways, and the Emperor, who favored opening Japan to the rest of the world and modernizing the country.  The group to which Saito belong remained loyal to the Shogun, which dooms them as the troops of the Emperor take control of the country.

The civil war is creating a time of famine and poverty in Japan, so Yoshimura has left not only his clan but also his wife and children behind to find work so that he can send money home to his family.  Since he is a mercenary Saito and the other samurai see Yoshimura as being dishonorable.  When Yoshimura talks with love of the land from which he came, Saito, who cannot conceive of being loyal to a place rather than to a man, decides to kill Yoshimura.  But the ""country"" samurai is too good with a sword and believes that Saito's attack is just a test.  However, the key difference between the two is clearly established: Saito is alive because no one has killed him, while Yoshimura kills because he wants to stay alive.

It is clear that Yoshimura represents for Takita the personification code of Bushido.  Time and time again my Western sensibilities intruded into this film because with his great love for his family and the land from which he comes, I kept expecting Yoshimura to simply go home, but eventually got it through my thick skull that the point here is that he cannot go home, for several reasons.  Despite the brief battle and swordplay sequences, ""Mibu gishi den"" is really a character study and like Saito we come to recognize the true value of the strange samurai from the country, especially when the doctor finishes the tale and provide a sense of closure for the both old man and the viewing audience.

In the 2004 Awards of the Japanese Academy, ""Mibu gishi den"" won Best Picture with Nakai picking up the awards for Best Actor and Sato for Best Supporting Actor.  It was nominated for eight other awards, but apparently in Japan winning the Best Picture award does not carry over into a lot of technical categories.  However, I would certainly argue that it is Nakai's performance that elevates this film above the high levels of sentimentality that take up almost the entire final act.  Quite simply his performance was what made me round up in the final analysis on this decidedly different samurai film.",1135987200,166,3446,4.677152317880795
