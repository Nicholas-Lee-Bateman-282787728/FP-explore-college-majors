8331671,5,B001OXLGI2,"My son loves DragonTales and this is another video in the series. The stories talk about how important it is to take care of one's pet, and how to feed them properly, etc.

In one story, Cassie has a pet caterpillar that turns into a fairy butterfly, and my son liked that story the best.

A good video series for toddlers, either boys or girls. There's no violence and each story has a nice message.",1261785600,2,400,4.32
