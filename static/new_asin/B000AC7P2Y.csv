2384565,5,B000AC7P2Y,"I - literally, just finished watching an old VHS of Yog. This film was made at the tail end of the golden age of kaiju when budgets were shrinking and gets dissed a lot from the fan boys for being a mismash and a little slower than previous Toho kaiju films of the era. However, this and Latitude Zero are my favorite non-G Toho giant monster flicks.

First off, the score by Ifukube is one of his very best. I can not watch this movie and just listen to the track. It's a little different, and I really like the Gezora (giant cuddlefish) theme. If you like Ifukube, who was a genius imo, the price of the DVD is worth it in and of itself for this seldom heard brilliant score.

The film itself is kinda a sideways sequel to Attack of the Mushroom people. Do note the ""reunion"" scene from Attack of the Mushroom People (aka Mantango) in the beginning of the film between the actors who played ""Roy"" and the actor who played the millionaire yacht owner.

Yog's methodical pacing and island location give this film a unique 50's american sci-fi feel to it, but there's ample monster action to keep things from sinking to the unwatchable levels of bordom of most of the US monster flicks from that era. Honda, of course, keeps things moving and interesting. He really was the best director of these films. Yog is a unique entry, and that's what I like about it.

Gezora by the way, is a totally surreal vision. Probably the least ""realistic"" of Toho's kaiju creations, but somehow haunting - like an abstract painting, as it awkwardly flops in slow motion crushing the village huts. The effects in this film are a little bit better than standard Toho, since things are decidedly less outlandish than most of the G films that preceded it. The optical work is quite good, as is the miniature work. Especially noteworthy, is the excellent rocket launch sequence in the very beginning of the film.  Just shows you how effective low-budget miniature work by the Japanese masters could be when given a ""doable"" task (a space craft lift-off, as opposed to the destruction of a city by giant monsters...) Another nicely handled sequence is the optical work in the underwater sequence between the divers and Gezora. This scene seemed to contain some barely detectable sophisticated traveling matte work. The crab and lobster costumes are of a different, unique design that look a cut above the average Toho monster suit.

Course, they always throw in a cringe inducing shot or two, like those ridiculously obvious dolls when Gezora picks up its victims. Did they do this on purpose?

Then again, that's one of the elements that keeps the Japanese monster movies from the 60's fun and interesting, isn't it?",1123891200,19,2694,4.670886075949367
2384566,5,B000AC7P2Y,"Space Amoeba is an excelent giant monster movie from the creators of the original Godzilla.  It was originally released in America in 1970 by American International as YOG- MONSTER FROM SPACE.  It features four creatures,  Yog, a formless intelligence from space,  Gezora, a giant land walking cuttlefish,  Ganime, two giant sand crabs and  Kameba, a gigantic jungle snapping turtle. There is a huge three way battle of course.

This is an obscure and underrated flick from Toho studios, everyone knows about the big Green, mutated dinosaur, that shoots atomic breath from his mouth but no body knows about the other awesome creature characters created by the monster factory it's self Toho co. ltd. This monster clash is all around fun. However the cover art may be misleading to fans for Gezora(giant cuttle fish) does not fight either of the 2 Ganimes (Giant Rock Crabs). However we still get a colossal battle between Kamoebas(Giant Turtle) and one Ganime(Giant Crab). The film is cool and actually has a unique character who is possessed by a Space Amoeba and has to fight free of it's corrupt and  evil ways. I won't ruin anything but the inner battle between Obata and the amoeba is cool/unique. The end battle is amazing and the eruption is always cool.

2384581,5,B000AC7P2Y,"Space Amoeba was supposedly one of Toho's last monster movies from the 1970's era of Kaiju films.  A space probe drops back to earth containing an alien esscence that looks like a blue mist.  The mist takes control of some of the islands marine life including Gezora (a cuttlefish), Ganime (a crab), and Kameobas(a turtle)causing them to grow into giant monsters.  The monsters begin wrecking havoc on the island and making life miserable for the natives and some Japanese tourists, who must find a way to deal with them before the alien takes over the world (how it's going to do that with just some giant animals on a single island in the Pacific I have no clue).

This is a very fun monster movie.  The film's pacing moves along perfectly so that it never gets boring.  The monsters themselves do look a bit goofy(especially Gezora who looks more cute than scary), but it's really fun to watch them destroy stuff and fight each other.

This is one of Toho's more lighthearted monster movies out there.  If you want something you can take more seriously, check out Matango, Rodan, or Godzilla(1954), but if you're in the mood for something quick, goofy, and fun, then give this one a chance!",1329177600,,1193,4.6746411483253585

2384584,4,B000AC7P2Y,"This is a Tokyo Shock release of a Japanese monster film called Kessen! Nankai no Daikaiju Gezora, Ganime, Kameba; better known to American monster movie fans over age 40 as Yog-Monster From Space. It made the drive-in circuit and then was given a lot of airplay on tv back in the 1970's. As most people reading this are likely  familiar with the movie via those monster shows of days gone by, this is less a review of the movie itself than a comparison of the dvd and the AIP version which the reader is likely to expect. I will say to those who have never seen it that it is more fun than its reputation would have you think, and if you like Japanese monster films then you will probably find something to enjoy here.
  The dvd contains two versions of the movie, the Japanese original (subtitles available) and the international English release. The international dubbing is done by the Hong Kong studio that fans of 70's Godzilla movies are familiar with. As opposed to many of those movies, the dubbing in this one isn't too bad, but isn't of the quality of the AIP release. Being familiar with the AIP version (I had one of the rare public domain pre-records for years), I can tell you that AIP took a lot of liberties with dialogue, but their version was less dry and more lively than the versions herein. Gone are a lot of Obata's jokes (...you ought to open up a church with Ombo!) and professor Miya's melodramatic ramblings (...we're at the mercy of something no one has ever seen!). Curiously, the facial expressions of the actors seem more appropriate to the AIP dialogue than the Japanese original in many scenes. Also, the native music in the AIP version is reduced to a drum track, which a viewing of the dvd reveals to be the native music from King Kong vs. Godzilla.
  Even though this release isn't the AIP version, it's still a worthwhile purchase on it's own merits, and unless you're willing to hunt down the previously mentioned VHS, it's all there is.",1275523200,,1975,4.552112676056338

2384586,4,B000AC7P2Y,"Better known as Yog, Monster From Space, this Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock DVD release is another welcome addition to its expanding daikaiju library. With a healthy complement of extras, it features a beautiful, widescreen print and a choice of the original Japanese soundtrack with subtitles or English dubbing--though not the Titra dub that accompanied the 1971 American International release of Yog; this is the inferior international dub created in Hong Kong.

An unmanned space probe splashes down in the south Pacific, bringing with it an alien life form that transforms specimens of the local fauna into rampaging behemoths. An expedition sent to scout the remote Selgio Island for commercial development run up against the big critters--and the alien force--with fairly ugly results.

Outside of Space Amoeba, I don't think you'll find another movie that features a gigantic squid walking upright on its tentacles. But Gezora, the cuttlefish in question, despite being so obviously a man in a rubber squid suit, has some pretty wicked moments on the screen. With its bulging eyes and writhing tentacles, Gezora possesses a demeanor almost intimidating enough to temper the obligatory chuckles. Ganime, the giant crab, and Kameba, the mutant turtle, also have some entertaining moments, particularly when menacing their diminutive human quarry.

The well-constructed, relatively large-scale miniature sets, colorful cinematography, familiar cast, and Akira Ifukube's driving score make Space Amoeba an enjoyable flick, despite a weak screenplay and dialogue that's lame even in the original Japanese.",1265500800,,1605,5.651452282157677

This is another silly outing from the Toho studios during their hey day! I can't resist these goofy films from my youth, even though they are silly with hilarious FX. They do bring us ""Godzilla/Toho"" fans back to a simpler time, when all you needed was a creepy flick on TV(Creature Features,Chiller Theater) and a few plastic army men to keep you happy. I spent many hours in the lobby of the local theater during Matinees recreating the fight scenes with my friends and destroying popcorn boxes etc. LOL! Aaahhh...the good ol' days!

2384593,5,B000AC7P2Y,"""Space Amoeba"" is one of the more surreal Japanese rubber monster movies featuring four monsters, though only three are made of latex. Filmed in Guam, this was the last non-Godzilla film to be made by the great Ishiro Honda. The DVD is extremely well done, especially considering the lack of extras on most DVDs of this genre. The movie is an excellent transfer and contains a commentary track (!) with Producer Fumio Tanaka, which is almost as entertaining as the film itself. There are also trailers, a documentary on the real animals that inspired the creatures in the film, and more.

The plot is essentially this: an unmanned spacecraft is intercepted by a monster, the space amoeba of the title (and apparently known as Yog in the original release), which looks like blue scrubbing bubbles invading a scarcely altered Apollo Command Service Module (CSM). When the spacecraft returns to earth with the Yog-spores it lands near an island which is slated to become a resort destination. The spores act to gigantify creatures that then trample all over the island, though avoiding each other for most of the movie (many villages are destroyed, however). The creatures are Gezora, a cuttlefish-like affair, Ganimes, a crab, and Kamoebas, a snapping turtle. Without question, Gezora is the most ridiculous creature I have ever seen onscreen (unless you count some of the creatures from ""Ultraman""); I particularly enjoy watching him walk on his tendrils.

The main human characters are a couple of photographers, one of whom gets possessed by Yog, and the perky female advertising assistant. Ultimately the plot all comes to a head when the creatures converge on an active volcano along with the possessed guy; after all the monsters are immolated in the lava the island is ready for tourism.

The film lacks the typical Honda good-versus-evil rubber monster, with all monsters equally bad. Offsetting this oversight is the bonus commentary track which is much more interesting than I expected. It is in Japanese with English subtitles, but Tanaka shares many interesting tidbits about making these films which will please grade-Z movie fans. I was especially pleased that Tanaka noticed the resemblance between the star of the film, Akira Kubo (""Matango: The Fungus of Terror""; ""Attack of the Mushroom People""), and Charlie Sheen (which cannot possibly be overlooked). He also had some other interesting comments relating to Apollo 11 and Apollo 13 (the Apollo 13 accident occurred during filming). My favorite part of the commentary was when Tanaka and his interviewer discuss at great length the definition of the word ""minx"" and how it applied to various Toho starlets. His understated humor and observations are genuinely entertaining, and I recommend the commentary track highly.

I would have probably given the film four stars as a Japanese rubber monster movie, but I finally settled on five due to the bonus features, especially the commentary. Fans of Japanese films and monster movies in general will delight in this film.",1143504000,22,3034,5.135627530364372
2384594,4,B000AC7P2Y,"You may have been originally released as Gezora, Ganime, Kameba: Kessen! Nankai no daikaij (1970), but you'll always be Yog: Monster from Space (1971) to me...directed by the legendary Ishir Honda (Godzilla, Rodan! The Flying Monster, The Mysterians), with original music by Akira Ifukube (Godzilla, Rodan! The Flying Monster), the film features a host of familiar faces to those who love on these Japanese Toho monster features including Akira Kubo (Gorath, Matango, Destroy All Monsters), Atsuko Takahashi (Destroy All Monsters), Kenji Sahara (Matango, Atragon, Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster), and Yoshio Tsuchiya (Baran: Monster from the East, Matango, Godzilla Vs. Monster Zero).  Also appearing is Noritake Saito (Godzilla vs. Gigan), Chotaro Togin (Destroy All Monsters), Tetsu Nakamura (Mothra), Yukiko Kobayashi (Destroy All Monsters), and Wataru Omae (Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster).

The movie begins with an unmanned rocket blasting off into space, one that's carrying a space probe intended to scope out Jupiter.  On it's way to the Jovian gas giant, the probe encounters some sparkly space dust, which gloms on to the craft, takes control, and turns it back towards Earth.  During its re-entry, a photographer named Taro Kudo (Kubo), traveling on a plane, witnesses the craft crash into the ocean, but no one believes him.  He then gets an offer from a development company to photograph an island where they plan to build a paradise resort, and he agrees only because the island happens to be in the same area he saw the probe crash (great idea there, building a luxury resort on Monster Island).  Along for the ride are a really annoying company woman named Ayako (Takahashi), a scientist named Dr. Kyoichi Mida (Tsuchiya), and a mysterious individual named Makoto Obata (Sahara).  Prior to their arrival, a company man on the island has an encounter with a gianormous squid (be sure to send us a postcard from inside the beast's belly), and the natives go crazy go nuts (they believe the arrival of the outsiders has angered their god, resulting in the giant monsters getting all frisky).  The group arrives on the island and soon enough sees first hand the wackiness caused by the space dust, which is actually some sort of amoeba-like alien life form, and its penchant for embiggening the local animal population.  There's the giant squid, followed by a humongous crab, and last, but not least, a monstrous snapping turtle.  Turns out not only is the alien goo a sentient being, but one that desires to dominate the world, and has been super sizing various beast in order to make it happen.  The various monsters thrash the island, copulating with many a thatched hut in the process, the small group fights back with the help of the natives (initiating what has to be the biggest cookout I've ever seen), but given the enormity of the beasts, all hope seems lost.  All bow down before your new alien embiggened crustacean masters!

While this may not be one of my favorite Japanese monster features, it's still kinda fun (I have a hard time believing Honda was behind this one).  I suppose the main issue I have with the film is the fact that while there are various monsters running around, they don't really engage each other in any battles (at least not until the end), or have any real personality, as the aliens control them all, and there is no `hero' type creature (like Godzilla) to save the day, providing some real rompin' stompin' action.  The creatures do work over the native village pretty well, but how many thatched huts can you see smashed before it gets old (I think maybe a limited budget confined the action to the island, avoiding the cost of tons of miniatures)?  Had the beast actually made it to civilization, then we would have had something, but it never happens.  Here's a really funny bit...initially we're told the development of a paradise resort on this island was supposed to be some sort of top secret project, but when the group arrives on the island, there's a good sized sign posted, the kind developers use to advertise what they're building on a specific piece of land, which is really a great way to keep a secret (actually, the hotel was supposed to be some sort of submarine habitat, I think...the story began falling apart at the seams as more ultimately useless plot details were revealed).  I suppose it didn't really matter, as the island was fairly remote, but then how stupid is that, to put up a sign virtual no one will see?  Arggh...another really funny bit was when one of the main characters early on actually proposed the whole `monster' aspect a hoax, despite the fact that not only was the company hut completely demolished (along with the man inside), but there was a humongous path of plant destruction from where the giant squid walked across land to get to the hut, and then traveled back to return to the water (who knew squids could walk?).  I liked most of the characters in the story well enough (the two company men stationed on the island were pretty idiotic), but I did find the female lead about the most irritating I've seen in a long time.  If she's not screaming indiscriminately, she's offering forth the most idiotic statements and just making herself a pest in general.  The only reason the others didn't feed this useless bit of excess baggage to the monsters immediately was because she did rate relatively high on the `cute' scale.  Her character really served no purpose in the film other than to provide keep it from being a sausage fest (an all male film).  As far as Dr. Kyoichi Mida, the scientist hired by the development company to examine the native animal life, he makes some of the most intuitive deductions this side of a Sherlock Holmes movie.  Seriously...from out of nowhere he comes up with the theory that the giant monsters are a result of manipulation by some alien life form...yes, it happened to be true, but I have not a clue in hell how he came up with this given how little he actually had to go on...as far as the monsters go, I thought they looked pretty cool, showing a whole lot of detail.  The squid was a bit funky, but the crab was spectacular, with the snapping turtle falling somewhere in between.  Eventually a couple of these creature do tangle (near the end), as you really can't have a giant monster movie like this featuring three beast and not have them fight at some point.  It may seem like I have a lot of misgivings about this film (I do), but I still had a lot of fun between the unintentional stupidity of some of the characters and the monsters themselves.  There's any number of better Japanese monster, or ""kaiju"", films out there, but if you've curious, this one's worth a look.

Media Blasters provides an excellent looking anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) picture on this DVD, along with a newly created Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound audio track, along with a Dolby Digital mono track.  As far as extras, Media Blasters goes that extra mile yet again providing a commentary track with producer Fumio Tanaka, a short documentary titled `Meet the Marine Animals behind the Monster!', a special announcement bit, an original trailer, English subtitles, and previews for other Media Blasters DVD releases like Dogora (1964), The Mysterians (1957), Varan the Unbelievable (1962), and Atragon (1963).

We'd just like to see the whole film...",1141344000,3,503,4.8023255813953485

8077803,4,B000AC7P2Y,"Space Amoeba is absolutely one of the craziest giant monster movies I have ever seen. Glowing blue energy aliens possess and giantifies a turtle, a crab, and a cuttlefish (Billy: Chicks dig cuttlefish) in order to take over the world. If only Godzilla was here to save the day, but instead we get a bunch of humans who do a pretty good job. The English dubbing is cheesy, the monster costumes are goofy, and the special effects are somewhat decent for its time. Not as grand as any Godzilla movie, but still a good giant monster movie none the less.",1518739200,,549,4.5
8077804,3,B000AC7P2Y,"A classic tacky monster film in every way. Flimsy back story, fears of space and science, giant monsters, alien possession, and bad dubbing!

If you are feeling nostalgic or just want a good tacky film to rip on, here you go!

Relatively child safe aside from the explosions and implied deaths. The overall theme of kill it with fire is pretty tame by todays standards.",1517961600,,369,4.661538461538462

8077807,3,B000AC7P2Y,"SPACE AMOEBA (aka: YOG: MONSTER FROM SPACE- 1970) begins w/ a trip to Jupiter gone awry, when a strange, alien entity takes control of the spacecraft, turning it back toward Earth. Coincidentally, a photographer witnesses the ship's re-appearance, and happens to get a job at a Pacific island location. This very island is also where the ship landed! Astonishingly, giant monsters have been reported in the area! Huge tentacles of doom emerge, as a titanic squid attacks! Soon, the squishy creature is walking on land and causing havoc! Meanwhile, the dull subplot has the humans battling over developing the island into a resort. Thankfully, it's not long before more terror erupts, and Gezora (Squiddly Diddly) destroys a village! When the villagers and their visitors find Gezora's weakness, the alien that possessed it moves on to another host. Suddenly, a giant crab moves in for the kill! Fortunately, the creepy crustacean is easily defeated, leading to... a man being possessed! We learn the true plans of the alien intelligence. Can the humans on the island stop the impending invasion? Perhaps, but first... a wedding! Ah, those crazy islanders! What the...?! A titanic turtle starts stomping around! Is mankind finished, or will there be calamary, crab cakes, and turtle soup for everyone? We live in hope. Not a bad movie, but those expecting non-stop monster fighting action, may be disappointed, as this is rather low-key on that score...",1513468800,,1452,5.156779661016949
