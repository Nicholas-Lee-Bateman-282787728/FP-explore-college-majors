Miles From Tomorrowland is a futuristic space themed animated series on Disney Junior.  It came out in February of 2015 and has some recurring characters with famous voice actors including Bill Nye, Alton Brown, Wil Wheaton, George Takei, and Mark Hamill.  The main character, Miles, is an enthusiastic and curious kid that often finds himself in and out of trouble.  His sister, Loretta, is the complete opposite and follows the rules and is the smarter of the two kids.  Their mother, Phoebe, is the spaceship's captain with their father, Leo, as the ship's engineer.  The parents work for Tomorrowland's Transit Authority and undertake many missions to keep outer space safe for all of its travelers.

The Let's Rocket DVD contains ten episodes including:

Runaway Shuttle -There's an out of control ice cream truck heading to one of Jupiter's smoldering moons, Io.  The Callistos have been summoned to assist their former schoolmate, Lucky, who is trapped in the ice cream vehicle.

Surfing the Whirlpool - Miles wants to go surfing with his dad where he used to hang out as a younger surfer dude.  While the mother and daughter stay behind, they learn of a huge gamma ray burst heading straight for Miles and his dad.

Ocean in Motion - The Callistos have been summoned to figure out why a probe has received water damage.  The most unusual part of this mystery is the planet that the probe is on, doesn't have any water.  Or does it?

Explorer Exchange - Blodger Blopp visits the Callisto family as part of a Cosmic Explorers exchange program.

Game On - While a new highway is being setup in an uncharted quadrant, the Callistos are sent to introduce themselves to the alien races in that sector to start an alliance.  They get captured as prisoners instead.

How I saved My Summer Vacation - The Callisto family is on vacation, but the vacant planet they visit is nothing like the pamphlets describe it.

Who Stole The Stellosphere?  While Miles is left behind to clean his room, his family's spaceship is stolen.  Can Miles stall the thief to help his uncle and family reclaim their ship?

Rock N' Roll - Miles is finally big enough to use the Exoflex.  His whole family is certified to use it, and it adds pressure for Miles to learn how to use it quickly.  Unfortunately, he's not the natural he had hoped he would be.  Miles will have to overcome his doubts and save his family from a rock slide on the moon using the Exoflex.

The Goldilocks Zone - Miles gets reunited with a former skating buddy of his. As sweet at the reunion is, the situation could have been better since his friend's home planet was destroyed.

Hiccup In The Plan - The Callistos accept a mission to locate a missing beacon.  However, the mission would be a lot easier to accomplish if Merc, the robotic ostrich, didn't have ship shaking hiccups.

My kids enjoyed this two hour DVD and are new fans of the Miles From Tomorrowland series.  My son liked the bundled blastboard flashlight.  The DVD sells for a little over $12 on Amazon and is worth buying for any kid that likes outer space.",1440633600,3,3131,4.669104204753199
7223157,4,B00YOJIDXY,"Miles from Tomorrowland (a very clever title, I must say) is a Disney Junior CG animated series about the futuristic Calistos family. A nuclear family with a mom, dad, son and daughter, they bring to mind several recent and classic TV shows. They remind me of The Jetsons, of course, to begin with, using phrases like blastastic and astrolutely. only they take a more active role in helping in the galaxy.

And as on Star Trek: Voyager, mom is the Captain (just like in my house). Like Thunderbirds, they receive assignments to assist and rescues, using their combined talents. Like Handy Manny, the family helps others and fixes things in their community of space. And like The Donna Reed Shows Stone clan, they're attractive, pleasant and free of serious dysfunction.

Olivia Munn voices Mom, Larry (Spongebob) voices Leo, the dad, with Cullen McCarthy as Miles and Fiona Bishop as Loretta, Miles sister. Miles rides around on a space ostrich named Merk (the amazing Dee Bradley Baker).

Each episode features two 11-minute stories, in which a mission is set up, or a fun activity, such as surfing in space, is explored. Kids are presented with role models in the form of adventurous, important Miles, and brilliant, problem solving Fiona. Its a great concept that works well for boys and girls equally. Unlike many other Disney Junior shows, there are no songs, perhaps to skew the show a little older.

The DVD offers episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9 from the first season. There are no bonus features, but the box contains a complimentary Blastboard Flashlight. Perhaps the tight budgets of DVDs nowadays means that premiums are more affordable than video extras, or quite simply these prizes have proven to have more appeal to consumers.",1440460800,9,1739,4.884745762711864
