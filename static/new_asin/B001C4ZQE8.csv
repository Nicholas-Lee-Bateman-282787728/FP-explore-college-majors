3505745,5,B001C4ZQE8,"Great show, great boxset, this is where it really gets goin' folks.

If you were disappointed with the lack of character development in the first box set, give this one a shot, because you are going to be learning a lot more about the characters and you will definitely start to care about them more. A new character will be introduced to the show who is an absolute riot(hes a perv to the max and his antics when he is around nami, or any woman in general will make you die laughing.) The straw hats will obtain a ship and they will actually start to look like a pirate crew. This is where the show really takes off and the addiction will start to set in(I was hooked after episode 15). Great times and great laughs await.

I always recommend watching japanese instead of english and this anime is no different, but I have to say as far as dubs go, its pretty elite. When  I watch it with my girlfriend we watch it in english because she has trouble reading subtitles and I was very pleasantly surprised. So for this one its either or, but the japanese voice acting is hollywood calibre/equivalent.

Basically pick this up, fans of good anime won't be disappointed.",1219708800,9,1166,4.434579439252336

3505747,5,B001C4ZQE8,"Part two of the much anticipated Funimation redub of One Piece. It's not that crappy, saturday morning one from 4Kids. Uncut and unedited the way it was supposed to be seen.

This collection contains the end of the ""Black Cat"" Arc and the beginning of the Baratie Arc. There's also pair of self-contained episodes in between, including Zoro's Past. The major villains in these arcs are Captain Kuro and Commodore Don Kreig. Usopp formally joins the crew and we are first introduced to Sanji.

Often I hear people say, ""One Piece doesn't get good until the Arlong Arc."" I believe that's wrong. One Piece starts relatively strong, and only grows stronger as it goes along. So by the time of the Arlong Arc, it's really honed it's storytelling skills. But, in this collection, you have two really strong episodes, Zoro's Past and Sanji's Dream that showcase how story has really changed in shounen anime.",1261699200,,901,4.8441558441558445

3505749,5,B001C4ZQE8,"here it is, the part of the Funi dub that everyone was waiting for, full of fighting, blood, and whats this..... no lolly pop? Sanji is back to being just eh way he should be, being a womanizing pervert who is also a chain smoker. Overall, the production value is high and so is its replay value.",1253836800,,296,4.2105263157894735
3505750,5,B001C4ZQE8,It was great and hilarius. the way they made all the action and everything else. It was really great.,1252108800,,101,4.368421052631579
3505751,4,B001C4ZQE8,"Although ""One Piece"" is spending a little too much time on spectacular fighting sequences, it still continues Luffy's epic journey with visually stunning fight sequences.

The first part of this box set continues Luffy and his crew's battles with Captain Kuro. As shown in the first voyage, Luffy and Usopp discovered that Kuro was posing as the butler for Kaya, so that he could assassinate her and receive her family's inheritance. Of course, Monkey D. Luffy's crew won't stand for that, and they engage Kuro, Django and the Black Cat Pirates in some spectacular fight sequences.

Luffy then travels on his new ship, the Going Merry, first to an abandoned island where a strange green haired man dwells in a treasure chest. Finally, Luffy sets out to find a cook for his crew at the Baratie Sea Restaurant. After accidentally bouncing a cannonball into the restaurant, Luffy is forced to work a whole year to pay for repairs. He also meets Sanji, the suave souz chef who fights with his powerful kicks. Sanji and Luffy battle against Don Krieg, a starving pirate captain with body armor bearing machine guns.

As I said, ""One Piece"" can get somewhat exhausting with its battles. ""One Piece"" almost gets too sucked into shonen-style battles, with fancy special powers and little attention to the plot. However, some of the storylines are surprisingly good. Anime fans will love the conclusion to the Captain Kuro story arc.

And Sanji makes an excellent debut as a new character in One Piece. He's bent on serving food to anyone who needs a meal. Not only that, but he's one heck of a breakdancing fighter. And he has a crush on Nami, the pirate thief.

""One Piece"" still manages to impress me with awesome fight sequences and some excellent shonen-style stories, even if I've seen this formulaic shonen anime style before. I'm looking forward to watching the end of the Don Krieg battles.

Keep in mind that the series gets a tad violent when Roronoa Zolo fights against the greatest swordmaster in the world, Dracule Mihawk. Zolo gets cut up really badly, and loses quite a lot of blood.",1236643200,2,2090,4.807799442896936

3505753,5,B001C4ZQE8,"Another great release from FUNimation. This set contains episodes 14-26 and continues where the end of Season One: First Voyage left off. In this set, we're introduced to the trash-talking, perverted cook Sanji and the man that is Zoro's biggest obstacle in becoming the greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk. We also take a look at Usopp, Zoro and Sanji's childhood and see what made them into the men they are today. Like I said in my Season One: First Voyage review, this series is definately overlooked by many anime fans and this is definately worth getting.",1225756800,4,560,4.905263157894737
3505754,5,B001C4ZQE8,"This is a great continuation of the first One Piece box set. Funi once again shows that they've taken ownership of the license and produced a quality English dub with voice acting on par with much of American animation. By now, the only qualms are the lack of the original Japanese logo anywhere on the set (even as an alternate angle! Please? Just once...?) and that there's only 13 episodes. Funi's budget probably doesn't allow the release of more at a time, but you'll blow through these 13 fairly quickly. It doesn't help that by the show's long-running format, these episodes only finish up the Kuro arc from the last set and get halfway through the Don Krieg arc. At last you get the formal introduction of Sanji and Zoro's backstory along the way.

Highly recommended. The One Piece saga only gets better from here, I can't wait to see where Funi's dub goes next.",1222905600,3,871,4.619354838709677
3505755,4,B001C4ZQE8,"First off, One Piece is one of my favorite anime series of all time. These next episodes truly showcase why One Piece is so wonderful. From the tragic flashbacks that make you cry like a baby to the heart-warming scenes of compassion from the characters who, unlike real pirates, want to help even the most lowly of strangers.

As usual, the Japanese voice acting is amazing. I swore I would never watch One Piece's dub....but now I find myself watching only the dub. Luffy's voice does take getting use to, especially if you love his Japanese voice. However, after a few episodes you are VERY grateful that he doesn't sound like 4kids' Luffy (who sounded like a deranged clown) anymore. So basically both language tracks are amazing and well-acted. In fact, I found myself more emotional when I watched the series in English instead of the Japanese language where I have to read subs and look at the show at the same time.

However, my biggest gripe is how Funimation is releasing the series. Why do we have to fork out $50 for 13/14 episodes?? You can buy an entire 26 episode anime series for way less than that. It doesn't help that One Piece's DVD box is made out of cheap cardboardish materials and the only extras on the set are trailers, credit-less openings and endings, and a commentary track or two. Wow. Thanks.

Definitely buy these DVDs..but if you're short on cash wait a month or two for the price to go down. Or find some coupons and buy it online like I do.",1222646400,10,1475,4.537593984962406

8286021,5,B001C4ZQE8,"It's great to get your movies, sit down with friends, and have a movie marathon. One Piece alone is awesome, but with all the season one discs, everything goes into place.
You can't just start watching from the middle, nor the end. You have to start from the beggining. A lot of characters don't just die off and that's the end. You re-meet a lot of characters, (especially at the Impel Down arc) and you need to know the relationship between them all.
Don't be scroogy and just watch/download from the internet (illegally or not) Get the discs/manga. All anime and mangas rely on the purchases/reviews/good feedback of the readers/buyers. If not enough people tune in and watch, or buy the anime/manga then it will get cut.
Help Oda out! Buy them,
