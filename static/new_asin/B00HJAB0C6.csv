This DVD is amazing both for the yoga practice element as well as the Cardio part. Look better and feel better all in one :) Highly recommend this DVD.",1390262400,,257,4.16
8633065,5,B00HJAB0C6,"I just purchased this dvd and I'm ecstatic.  I love the way he describes each position and explains each move in his mellifluous tones.  This is the perfect dvd for novice practitioner AND one more  experienced with yoga.

It even includes a separate section for ab work alone.  If you do those two things then you are set!!

but if you want the total package...then listen to his guided meditation so that you are transformed physically and mentally.",1390003200,2,451,4.717948717948718

8633067,5,B00HJAB0C6,"I would recommend either of Skip's DVD's to anyone who wants to either stay in shape, or get back into shape. They both really cover the newbie as well as the experienced athlete. He gives you a well thought out approach to getting the most from your workouts. If I feel like it's too much for me, there is always an alternative till I can move to the next level.
I found the DVD's to be not only very useful regarding my working out, but were also very inspirational as well. You really get pumped, because he's pumped to be doing it right along with you. Highly recommend it.",1389052800,2,577,4.302752293577981
