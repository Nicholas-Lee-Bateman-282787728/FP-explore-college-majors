I don't mind doing these reviews but it is hard to say things in 20 words or more...This is all I can say. I love it and I love Michael Jackson.",1331596800,,298,4.321428571428571
8443472,4,B004VKGI88,"This was a nice collection of dvd videos of Michael Jackson, but there was not much new footage contained in any of the videos. In fact, much of the same pictures, interviews, and footage was used in both of the videos contained in this collector's box. If you are a true Michael Jackson fan and collector, you may enjoy this in your own collection, otherwise the greatest part of this collection is the box that the videos came in. R.I.P. Michael. You are truly missed!",1315094400,9,470,4.541176470588235
8443473,1,B004VKGI88,"This product is comprised of 2 already released DVDs. Michael Jackson Thank You for the Music The Final Word and Michael Jackson Never Surrender. Thank You for the Music has some good snippets of already released footage of Micheal but there is a great deal of misinformation and personal bias expressed by the English commentators. There are also some interviews and comments by people that worked with both the Jackson 5 and Michael on his solo work which are positive.

Never Surrender is the same material released on Michael Jackson A Remarkable Life DVD. There are is no actual Michael Jackson music included in this DVD.

I gave this 1 star since the description is not an accurate depiction of what is in the Collection, which leads the buyer to believe this is new material and not what is actually included.",1314489600,11,817,4.787234042553192
