1715432,2,B000067IXO,"I didn't really like this movie at all, it's a slasher with very lame kill scenes, a lame story , horrible acting. The only thing that improves the movie was the last couple of minutes with the twist on the identity of the killer or killers but other than that stay away. No scene selections and no special features. There's another thing i would love to note is that the dvd cover makes no sense at all why is there a SCREAM ghostface mask on the cover, the killer never wore that mask, but don't be tricked its nothing like SCREAM movies.",1267315200,,540,4.303921568627451
1715433,3,B000067IXO,"I'LL ADMIT IT...I SAW THIS MOVIE BECAUSE OF ANNA FARIS STARRING IN IT. IT WAS ONE OF HER EARLIER FILMS. IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD SLASHER FILM AND IF YOU LIKE THOSE, YOU SHOULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE!!",1153180800,,190,4.162162162162162
1715434,5,B000067IXO,"Gore doesen't make a movie, but this one had enough when it was needed, but talk about a great slasher movie.  Awesome twist ending, great atmosphere, great scares, cool killer = awesome slasher film.  Highly recommended.",1148947200,,221,5.111111111111111
1715435,1,B000067IXO,"Lover's Lane....another no brainer slasher movie straight to video and its really horrible. Lover's Lane is the hot spot to where you wanna go to make out but 15 years ago some people were murdered up at that joint and 15 years later, some relatives of the people who were murdered up there (always is) Are tormented in the present but the ""Hook Man"" from the Urban Legend. Pretty much a snoozer with bad acting (who calls this acting good?). How many screaming teenaged girls have we seen in movies? It only works if the movie is good and this is not a good movie. The plot twists and turns aren't even that great....idiotic writing. Starring: Riley Smith (Radio, 8 Legged Freaks), Erin J. Dean (Lolita, A Pig's Tale), Suzanne Bouchard (Joyful Partaking), Sarah Lancaster (Four Kings, Dr. Vegas), Diedre Kilgore (Good Luck, The Falls), Billy O'Sullivan (A Change Of Heart, Rites), Matt Reidy (Hit and Run, Carried Away) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-4, Just Friends) in one of her earlier movies. Nothing can save this from being thrown over a cliff....it's ridiculous.",1142208000,,1070,4.820652173913044
1715436,5,B000067IXO,This movie is great fun and not too bloody.  Get a bowl of popcorn and just settle in for a good time.,1100908800,2,102,3.6363636363636362
1715437,4,B000067IXO,"Welcome back to the early eighties as ""Lover's Lane"" revisits the time when low budget slashers were all the rage. The film tells the story of a deranged, hook-handed maniac who escapes the asylum on the anniversary of his previous massacre to kill again. Intro the whacky teens who decide to party near the scene of the original massacre and you can guess the rest. ""Lover's Lane"" is an enjoyable romp into familiar horror territory and boasts good performances by the young cast as well as an appearance by Richard Sanders from WKRP fame. The film is not high on bloody gore but there are plenty of victims and chase style suspense sequences to ensure a fun time will be had by all. Gotta like that out of control ending as well. The only complaint is that the DVD's lone extra is the theatical trailer, a director commentary would have been a welcome addition. In all, ""Lover's Lane"" should be of interest to fans of eighties slashers.",1061164800,3,938,4.622754491017964
7962884,5,B000067IXO,Saw Riley Smith right away and recognized him from True Blood and instantly had to watch the movie its a good B+ horror movie reminds me of an 80's horror movie kind of cheesy but good a little bit of gore but overall good.,1522108800,,223,4.090909090909091

7962886,5,B000067IXO,"LOVERS LANE (2000) begins one valentine's Day evening, w/ two young lovers carrying on in a car. Little do they know, that a madmen is creeping forth! A madman w/ a hook for a right hand! It's too bad these kids are in a convertible! Bloody homicides occur. Sheriff Anderson (Matt Reidy) and the rest of the police arrive on the scene, along w/ Dr. Jack Grefe (Richard ""Les Nessman"" Sanders). Another person was also killed. It's sheriff Anderson's wife! His daughter Mandy in tow, she sees her mom's body. Thirteen years later, a group of high school couples, including Mandy (Erin J. Dean) have decided to head for the title location for a Valentine's Day celebration. Gracious me! The hook man, Ray Hennessey, has escaped from the state hospital where he was being treated by Dr. Grefe! Could he be on his way to Amore Avenue? Is blood red? Oh yes, it is! Time! To! Get! Hooked! Can Sheriff Anderson find the randy revelers, before they fall prey to Hennessey's twelve inches of curved steel? LOVERS LANE is a solid tribute to 70's / 80's slasher films. It contains all of the basic elements of the genre, while still managing to be a bit different. The thoroughly twisted double-twist toward the end, provides the perfect finale! Co-stars a young Anna Faris as Jannelle the cheerleader, who dies in a most... awful, awkward way! Pure throwback gold!...",1512604800,,1356,4.725738396624473

7962888,3,B000067IXO,"I have to say I watch this movie because of Sarah Lancaster but I disappointed on the resolution of this movie. It's not so clear to watch.  But it is understandable as it's produced in 2000, the time when filming technology is not so great as today.",1505260800,,250,4.319148936170213

As they escape the car, they come across another couple, Harriet and Ward, who have already been slaughtered at the hands of this killer out of envy. Not long after, Sheriff Tom Anderson shows up with his young daughter, Mandy, and is shocked to discover that his adulterous wife, Harriet happened to be one of the victims. The killer, named Ray Hennessey, is caught, apprehended, and committed to a local institution for the criminally insane under the eye of Jack Grefe.

13 years later in 1999, Mandy is now a introverted bookworm of a high school student. Her classmates and peers consist of Jack's condescending daughter, Chloe; her boyfriend, Michael; cheerleader, Jannelle; Bradley; Doug; and couple Tim and Cathy.

7962892,5,B000067IXO,"Okay, so Lovers Lane is really low budget but it is still really good and fun to watch. And what's with the whole, ""is the daughter sleeping with Daddy incest thing""? Of course it is also interesting to see Anna Faris in her first released movie. Wow, she has come a long way. And where is the sequel - there should have been a sequel. Definitely 4+ stars in the low buget slasher category!",1367625600,2,390,4.283783783783784
7962893,5,B000067IXO,"Ahahahaha. It's so cheesy, it's good. The only reason I ordered this movie was because the movie stared Anna Faris from House Bunny. I thought the movie was super cheesy but I enjoyed it. Gave me lots of laughs. It's one of those movies that you just laugh at for the stupidity. It's a movie you can't take serious!",1296345600,2,315,4.3559322033898304
