8099178,4,B000CLMLYA,"Decent production, but at times the picture was not be best.  Enjoyed the interpretation of the store line.  As the book is very long each of these movies can have different parts and not deviate from the novel.",1494028800,,211,4.526315789473684

8099181,1,B000CLMLYA,"To be clear I love this movie and the picture is great, but I bought two copies seeing as my sister also loves this movie.  My sister went to put the movie in the DVD player and despite all the labeling it was the wrong movie.  We double checked what it said on the disk and the disk said Les Miserable but the movie on the disk was Ephraim's Rescue.  We then checked the copy I bought for myself and thankfully it was the right movie.  So one win and one loss.",1452643200,,461,3.9782608695652173
8099182,1,B000CLMLYA,"I do not know where Amazon is getting their DVDs from but I have tried TWICE to get this movie and was given a DVD that had Ephraim in the title and NOT Les Miserables.  As a fan of Hugo's novel and the musical, I was VERY disappointed in this and was hoping to have this a small gift to myself.  Shameful.",1436918400,,306,3.9193548387096775

8099185,4,B000CLMLYA,"Great movie-
no special features,deleted scenes or anything like that.

It is one of the most famous tales ever told-
do you really need my review?

I'm just going to limit my comments to the
DVD itself, not the actual story.

It was not a great conversion to DVD-
it just seemed closer to VHS.

Still,
I'd take this version of the classic tale  over the others I have seen.",1400716800,,374,4.285714285714286
8099186,4,B000CLMLYA,"As I viewed this wonderful story, I couldn't help but notice the 'earthiness' of the people who portrayed these memorable charachters.  Not to say that the other versions weren't wonderful, they are but this one is less 'Hollywoodized' and for me, it seemed as though it should be that way.  You also see the earthiness in the color of the film; there is more brown and white rather than the full spectrum.

The narrator also gives a little background story on the charachters and how they came to be the way that they are described in the story.  This in itself adds to the length of the film but it is worth it as there is so much in detail to take in.  For the money, this film is worth the price!",1202688000,5,700,4.2727272727272725
