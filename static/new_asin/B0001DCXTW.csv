1990915,3,B0001DCXTW,I like these videos in general but my daughter likes volumes 1 & 2 better than this one.  I thought the monkey head lice segment was a little wierd.,1173571200,4,148,4.103448275862069
1990916,5,B0001DCXTW,"Maybe the poses aren't all legit, but they are fun.  The instructor is not irritatingly peppy, she's calm and happy, and it's a great departure from many kids' videos.  I bought this after checking it from the library, and have since bought Yoga 123 from the same instructor.  Highly recommend for kids 2-5years, and probably for kids a little older, too.",1167782400,,355,4.786885245901639
1990917,2,B0001DCXTW,"I was excited to find a way of introducing my 3 year old son to yoga and thought I had found the answer after reading the reviews of this DVD.  However, there isn't much real yoga here. He tends to have a lot of excess energy and I was hoping that yoga would help him focus a little better (as much as possible for one his age), but there isn't a good flow to the poses and the ""silly"" part is just too silly.  There is also too much down time between the poses.  All this distracts him from learning the actual poses.  He is very interested in learning about yoga, but this DVD just didn't capture his attention.

UPDATE 2013:  After a few more years and another child, with a completely different personality, I still stick by my original review.  I have had a yoga practice for many years and my children have watched me doing yoga since they were babies.  They know what the poses look like.  I think they don't like to watch this video, because it looks nothing like the real thing.  They are both very keen to learn yoga and try to follow along with me and my yoga DVDs, but the ones meant for adults are a little too ""dry"" for children.  So they can become frustrated.  I had hoped that this DVD would bridge the gap, because it shows young people doing the poses and it tries to make it fun.  However, it is so removed from what yoga really is.  I think this would be a fun video to help young children get in touch with moving their bodies, but if exposing children to the discipline of yoga is what you are after, this is not the video to do it.",1146009600,31,1555,4.157190635451505
1990918,5,B0001DCXTW,I have done this DVD with my two children several times before bedtime.  It really does calm both of them down and get them ready for bed.  Some of the poses are a little difficult for my youngest child (age 2 1/2 ) but my 4 1/2 year old is very capable of them.,1142899200,34,262,3.8333333333333335
1990919,4,B0001DCXTW,"We bought YogaKids2 first and loved it so much that I went back to buy this version.  While it is still amusing and fun to do, there are a lot of visual cutaways from the kids which tends to distract from the yoga itself.  As another reviewer said, there is a lack of transition from one move to the next.  I also thought there could be more of the calming time near the end.  Unfortunately, you get through the calming time and then when the credits roll they show the kids being silly again, which kind of defeats the purpose.  Generally, though, this is a good introduction to yoga for kids - the kids are cute and entertaining and the poses basic enough to try.",1128297600,16,665,4.288
1990920,4,B0001DCXTW,"I bought this for my almost three year old who (I've recently come to terms with) is high energy.  I decided to introduce him to yoga in hopes of giving him a great life long tool in managing his excessive energy.  The beginning is a bit drawn out for his attention span as well as the in between pose descriptions.  I think as he gets older this will be a great dvd for him to follow along.  But, for now, I find I'm doing most of it by myself :-).  Although, it's great for us moms too!",1127865600,11,488,3.9896907216494846
1990921,5,B0001DCXTW,"This was a cute video. I bought it for my 4 year old goddaughter who has lots of energy!!! It has good exercises for building and releasing energy, but has no transition moves, which makes it hard to follow as a calm down tool.",1127606400,,227,4.181818181818182
1990922,5,B0001DCXTW,"My daughter and I started doing YogaKids every evening when she was 18 months old. At first, she could only do one pose, but she watched the kids doing yoga with great interest and now, at age 2, these are her very favorite. She's learned yoga and lots of new words and concepts from these creative and challenging videos. My daughter is still mastering new poses and is so proud of herself as she tries and achieves new things. It is a great DVD to do with your child. It is our favorite part of the day. Silly to Calm is a great bedtime yoga practice. It loosens us up and brings us down to a calm, peaceful state. My daughter is ready to move into bed when this video is done and she does so happily and easily!",1101945600,49,714,4.143884892086331
1990923,5,B0001DCXTW,"I purchased this video a few weeks ago for my 2.5 yr old son. My son is VERY high energy and since it's Fall and soon will be Winter I wanted to find exercises to do with him indoors so he won't be bouncing off the walls. This video is EXCELLENT! At first he didn't get it but after I showed him how to do the moves he loved it! He actually picked this DVD over his Brainy Baby and Baby Einstein videos! The lady's voice is very calm and reassuring and the dvd is informative wich I enjoy and my son does as well (learning about nature, our bodies, some words in sanscript etc). Most importantly the video actually WORKS. We did it an hour ago as a matter of fact. My son was bouncing around and acting silly towards the beginning of the video but towards the end he was actually calm and still is an hour later. I can't recommend this DVD enough!",1099180800,86,847,4.108433734939759
1990944,5,B0001DCXTW,"This dvd is genius. I have a very active four year old, and it settles her down. It's engaging and on a good level for her. the poses are well explained and she likes that it is other kids doing the poses and working through them.  A favorite in our house!",1463529600,2,256,4.019607843137255
1990945,5,B0001DCXTW,My 2 year old son loves this he laughd the whole time he does the poses.  He only lasts about 15 mins into the video but Im sure as he gets older he'll last a little longer.,1458691200,2,173,3.675675675675676

It is a bit long for his attention span, but we can start right where we left off last and its no big deal.  He's not very good at following the moves, but he does enjoy it and I think that'll help him continue to do it and eventually get good.

1991065,4,B0001DCXTW,"My daughters (2 and 4 years old) enjoy doing the poses and breathing like different animals. My favorite thing about this DVD is that it gives kids ideas about what to do when they are feeling angry, nervous or sad. My oldest likes putting a rubber ducky on her tummy and see it go up and down and she breathes in and out. I am looking for ways to help her relax because she is more on the anxious/nervous side.
We have a new routine now: every morning, before the rush of getting ready for school, we do a bit of yoga. I trust that it will be beneficial for them, and for me too!",1346284800,,580,4.052173913043478
1991066,5,B0001DCXTW,I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves it! Even her 2 year old sister likes to join in. This is a great way to introduce kids to yoga. It works well before bed time to help calm them down and relax for bed.  The instructor and the children are all very likeable. We really enjoy doing this together when I am visiting. I would recommend this for ages 2-8.  I plan on buying more Yoga Kids.,1344124800,2,410,4.049382716049383

1991068,5,B0001DCXTW,"My daughter is five years old and she likes to do yoga or taichi since I used to teach both. I actually have a certificate for teaching kids yoga. I think this dvd is what I think kids' yoga should be: fun, maybe wild but come to the end learning how to balance and relax. Anyway in review of such a product my voice doesn't matter it's about the kids. I borrowed this copy from local library. My daughter fell in love with it instantly. The first day she had to do it all for three times! Then she practices it for three days never got bored. And incredibly her yoga poses are really getting better and better just in these three days. (That's why I am on Amazon now. I am buying the whole set since our library can only loan a DVD for 7 days). The instructor is loving and the kids in the DVD are great. The little models are actually a big part of the success of this DVD. Kids like positive peer pressure and like to do what other kids can do. I believe that there are other good kids yoga DVDs out there but since my daughter likes this one so much why bother to try others for right now?
Btw my daughter invited me to do the whole set tonight with her. I found out it is actually a lot of physical exercise. Now my body feels sore(since many days of out of exercise lol). It can also be a very fun family activity. Very healthy. Could be good for both you and your kids. (Maybe Wii can do it too but yoga teaches more than just body movements). I strongly recommend every family with young kids try some kids yoga either with this DVD or others. The bonding time and what you can get out of it is so precious.",1324252800,9,1615,4.081761006289308

1991107,2,B0001DCXTW,"This is a bad video. The filming itself is spastic, flipping from faces to faces at random.  My kids have a hard time following what on earth they are supposed to be doing.  Half of the kids they flip to, aren't doing the same move, and also, some of them aren't doing anything at all.

This movie is slow.  The start up is at least 6 minutes of BORING.  Trees.  Philosophy.  The slowest introduction of children's names ever.  She is so chatty.  And usually it's useless chat.  It's not helpful.  Honestly, I've had better luck teaching my kids yoga by using an adult yoga dvd, where there is instruction, pictures of what they are doing, and the pace is more realistic.

This isn't even yoga, this is more like a preschool class gone wrong.  Where the teacher is boring the children, half of them are standing around lost looking, and the other half are picking their noses.  The teacher is confusing, way too wordy.  Small children need concrete examples, and short phrases.  Touch your toes.  Then seeing everyone do it.
Not like five minutes of talking and spastically filming random children, some who are touching their toes, some who are thinking about touching their toes, some who have finished touching their toes.

She talks SO MUCH.  This is the chattiest, wordiest, longest talking of any instruction video I've ever seen.  It could be called ""ridiculously poor storytelling (And possibly a yoga move).

My kids will sit through about half of it, but they don't do any yoga.  Where, my kids will do a full 30 minute work out video with me, yoga or otherwise.  So I'd say this video is sorely lacking at instrucitons, and actual clear things to do.  My kids are 6, 4, and 3.",1291766400,13,1687,4.602693602693603

1991163,5,B0001DCXTW,Grandson age 4-1/2 loves it!  He started joining in and following along right away. Its a great way to encourage indoor (or outdoor) physical activity to burn off all that ENERGY young children have.  Instructor is fun and talks at just the right level for kids.  Highly recommend this DVD!,1245110400,2,290,4.76

1991165,4,B0001DCXTW,I liked and my 2.5 years old daughter seems to like it too but I think she is too little still to follow the instructions.,1244678400,,122,3.92
1991166,3,B0001DCXTW,"The kids like it well enough, but I think some of the poses are difficult even for adults and others are hard to do if you're on a yoga mat or carpet. Another problem is that even though it's billed as ""Silly to Calm"" I've found that the kids get hyped up on the ""silly pose"" and the rest of the poses do *not* calm them down. I also do not appreciate the spiritual/quasi-political aspects to the script. Finally, I think that the production values are very poor.

I have similar complaints regarding Wenig's ABC yoga video.",1239148800,9,524,4.402061855670103
1991167,5,B0001DCXTW,We use several Yoga kids DVDs.  My favorite thing about this one is that it encourages them to think about their feelings and how they deal with them.  It helps children visualize what they are feeling and how to act on those feelings.  I recommend it highly! :),1236038400,6,262,4.416666666666667

1991200,5,B0001DCXTW,"My 5 year old son loves this dvd. He will take it out on his own when he thinks he needs to calm down(he usually does). He is very active and I purchased it hoping it would help him learn how to relax. I wish I could say I use it more with him, but he usually pulls it out himslef and watches it and does the poses. Of course he likes the silly ones better. All in all a great dvd.",1227398400,,381,3.658536585365854
1991201,5,B0001DCXTW,"Both my 4 year old and I enjoy this video. My girl has Sensory integration disorder. It is a great tool to introduce to concept of yoga, breathing and exercise to children. It is fun, meaningful as well as helps with focus. The stretching and the changes in vertical positions really helps my girl become more self aware of her body which helps her emotionally calm down so that she can transition into our night time routine.",1223769600,,426,4.545454545454546

I have a professional background in TV production, so production value is important to me. This series does a very good job. I highly recommend it!",1199491200,,265,4.32
1991204,5,B0001DCXTW,"I put this yoga DVD in for my nephews age 3 and age 6 before bedtime last night (I was babysitting and needed them to calm down).  The 6 year old did a little better following along with the breathing and poses.  Towards the end of the DVD he even said, ""I should have done this instead of freaking out . . ."" (he had had a big tantrum the day before).  He even made up some of his own poses.  He called one the ""raindrop.""

The 3 year old mostly watched his brother or tried to knock him over, but he did keep up with the breathing, especially the ""dragon"" breathing part.

I would really recommend this DVD.  It's really fun.  It helps kids get their energy out and calm down. They learn balance, coordination, and how to calm themselves down through breathing.",1193097600,,763,4.25
1991205,3,B0001DCXTW,this video is ok... I have used it for ages 3 to 5 and have found children at these ages would either like more instruction on how to do the poses as well as learn more poses or would rather more capturing animation related to popular kids movie stories such as the Disney series...,1185926400,2,282,4.2407407407407405
1991206,3,B0001DCXTW,"This teaches some good basic techniques and the kids seem to enjoy it.  By the time they become bored it's just about time to go off.  I do have to encourage them to stick with it.  My main complaint is that there are a few long pauses with nothing to do while the video shows pictures of trees or other nature objects and the instuctor talks about the beauty of trees, etc.  It frustrates me, I've never seen an adult yoga video with so much down time, so it doesn't make sense to have that much free time for 3-6 year olds either.",1176595200,25,532,4.135922330097087
1991207,5,B0001DCXTW,"I am a Health and Physical Education teacher at an elementary school.  During the state testing week I show this video to my Pre K-5th grades.  At one point I had at least 43 first graders in the gym and had to keep them quiet.  I was amazed at how well they payed attention to this video and how quiet it kept them.  The last part of the video they were absoutely quiet and laying on their backs.  I had one second grader fall asleep.  She said, ""I was so relaxed and comfortable on the mat.  I didn't want to get up.""  Even my ""cool"" 5th graders were enjoying it.  I had many students ask me, ""Are we doing Yoga again today?!""

The beginning of the video gets all of their silly energy out and by the second half they are ready to relax.

This is my favorite video to show the students.  I recommend it!",1174521600,42,805,4.089743589743589
8010586,5,B0001DCXTW,"My 4yr old grandson enjoyed this but does not have the attention span to complete it. As a yoga teacher myself I like how the poses are presented. She makes the poses fun by having the kids act like various animals. Everything is based on real poses and techniques. And as described, it starts out active (wiggle like jelly was a hit) and winds down to more relaxing poses. I did the class myself first and it was a nice gentle workout. So Id advise parents to do it along with the child at least till the child has full attention span. Maybe 7 but thats an individual thing. I recommend because it is a beginning to learn the real poses on a level small kids can have fun with. No strict work on form. Just fun. (As a certified kids teacher I don't recommend worrying about form till age 7- let em have fun).  Id also suggest parents watch the whole beginning and bring kids in at the start of the class.",1523836800,,905,4.23121387283237

8010593,4,B0001DCXTW,"I purchased this DVD to use with my friend and her very energetic toddler. It was adorable to see her attempt several of the poses, shake her sillies out, and gradually become calm. The breaks in the video make it kind of hard for a younger toddler to maintain attention, however, as there were pauses for up to 30 seconds with no good visuals to keep her attention. We had to continuously try to refocus her energy back on the video before she ran off, which meant that we both had to do the entire video along with her. Even though she had difficulty staying focused, with the little that she did do and brief focus on her breathing, she actually did calm down very rapidly at end of the video and immediately went to sleep without a book or a bottle (which per mom was a first ever, and left dad in shock!) I'm sure with repeat efforts and a bit of aging (she is currently 2.5 years old) she will learn to love it even more. Give it a shot!",1471824000,3,943,4.186813186813187
