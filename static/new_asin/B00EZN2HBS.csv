8622424,3,B00EZN2HBS,"That's what this film is about: the Falun Gong and persecution of the Falun Gong in
mainland China.  While I impatiently waited for this documentary to come out, I
ran across a predecessor called ""Tortured in Red China"", which is an extended interview
with a Chinese man, Charles Lee, who became a US citizen, studied neurosurgery at
Harvard among other things, and went twice to China to speak out against government
repression of Falun Gong.  Both times he was arrested; both times he eventually got
out.  After having watched the earlier film I found that this one did not have much new to
add; this supplements Charles Lee's account with that of Jennifer Zeng, a former Chinese
communist party member who also became a practitioner of Falun Gong and was also
imprisoned.  Eventually she and her family made their way to Australia.  Either one of the
films are good; watching both is probably not necessary.",1387670400,2,910,4.84516129032258
8622425,5,B00EZN2HBS,"China has been part of my consciousness since my earliest years.  One of my first playmates was the child of a family who immigrated to the US at the time of the Chinese Revolution. Some of the first romance novels I read were by Pearl Buck. I mustn't forget to mention Tiananmen Square.  Nobody who saw the young man standing alone in front of a tank or the Lady Liberty made by an art student will ever forget it.  The Chinese have been struggling to be free for a long time.

There was a time that some thought that Mao might have the right ideas - universal suffrage, equality of women, a literate population where everyone was taught to read.  Sadly, the ideals of early Mao turned to the ""my way or the highway"", absolute control of every thought and aspect of individual life by the government at all costs that has led to repeated devastation of Chinese culture over the last 60 years.  One Hundred Flowers, Tiananmen - and the Falun Gong.

I do not often review things that might be described as political, but when I was asked to review&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Free-China-Courage-to-Believe/dp/B00EZN2HBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Free China: Courage to Believe</a>&nbsp;I was happy to make an exception to that rule.  Over the last twenty years the Falun Gong movement in China has gone from a government-approved health & fitness program to Enemy of the State #1.  Millions of Falun Gong practitioners have been locked away in China's prisons, forced into slave labor (often to make things that we buy here in the West), even murdered for their organs.

The film focuses on two individuals, Jennifer Zeng and Dr. Charles Lee.  Both Jennifer and Charles were born in China.  Charles left China just after Tiananmen Square, moved to the United States and became a citizen.  A medical doctor and business man, he was later imprisoned in China for Falun Gong related activities.  Jennifer Zeng - well educated wife & mother - was once a proud Young Pioneer and then a member of the Communist Party, one of the ""elite"" on track for the good life.  And then came the day that the Communist Party decreed that Falun Gong, then the largest movement in all of China, larger even than the Communist Party, was forbidden and all of its practitioners enemies of the state.  When Jennifer could not simply walk away from her belief in the simple way of Falun Gong - truthfulness, compassion and forbearance - she found herself arrested and jailed in China's prison system, undergoing physical and mental torture, forced to spend hours a day sewing and constructing items for sale in the West and even tested to see if she was a viable candidate for organ harvesting.  Today both Jennifer and Charles work to bring awareness to both East and West.

Grandma's $0.02 - Well worth taking the time to watch.  Highly recommended",1384300800,5,3165,5.190944881889764
