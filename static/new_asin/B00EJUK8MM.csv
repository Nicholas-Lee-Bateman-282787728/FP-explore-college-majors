8606126,5,B00EJUK8MM,"I have always loved J Hud every since she first sang I am Telling You in Dream Girls. I have watched her blossom into a great actress and a very beautiful woman. She and Terrence Howard whom I also love give riveting performances in Winnie. When they put Winnie in jail for over 400 days in solitary confinement I felt like my heart would burst with sympathy for her, her children and Mandela who was also in prison. The movie makes us aware that Winnie made mistakes but considering the great pressures thrust upon her shoulders I think anyone viewing the movie would have at least a little understanding of what occurred and wish Winnie well.  I wish that Mandela had fought for Winnie upon his release from jail, I wish Winnie had never been involved with mayhem, I wish her life had been completely exemplary but I love what Jennifer Hudson did with the role",1397606400,,862,4.5256410256410255
8606127,5,B00EJUK8MM,Winnie Mandela is a very strong courageous woman.  She kept Nelson Mandela's name in the limelight so that he was never forgotton.  She was kept in isolation for a very long time but her spirits were never broken.  Jennifer did a good job portraying Winnie.,1389052800,,257,4.666666666666667
8606128,5,B00EJUK8MM,"I saw this film in a local theatre a couple of Saturdays ago after reading a terribly negative review in the NEW YORK TIMES by Stephen Holden the day before.  He could find nothing much to like about the movie:  The director Darrell J. Roodt was rushed, whatever that means. Terence Howard has too little screen time and is merely a ""stick figure."" Winnie Mandela's role in the events surrounding the death of a teenage boy ""are not explored."" The white characters are basically caricatures.  And finally the reviewer did not like the song  Jennifer Hudson sings with a back-up choir at the end of the film although , as I recall, he does not state his reasons  for his distaste.

I am so glad I paid no attention to the review. I went to the movie because I like both Mr. Howard and Ms. Hudson as actors and  I am fascinated by the story of Nelson and Winnie Mandela.  (I will never forget hearing Mr. Mandela-- I believe Ms. Mandela was in attendance-- speak in Atlanta in 1990 soon after his having being freed from all those years as a political prisoner.) I left the theatre wondering if Mr. Holden and I saw the same movie. First these two actors give commanding,  riveting performances. And while it is not a requirement to play a historical figure, both these Mr. Howard and Ms. Hudson resemble Nelson and Winnie Mandela, particularly Mr. Howard to Mr. Mandela, something that adds to their performances. (Think Daniel Day Lewis in ""Lincoln."") I fully expected to see five minutes of the character Nelson Mandela. Wrong.  Even though he is sentenced  to prison at  Robben Island, he remains very much a part of his wife's life, at least for a time, and in the movie. And I ask, can a stick figure weep? The movie is called ""Winnie Mandela""-- based on a biography-- after all. Wouldn't we perhaps expect to see more of  Ms. Mandela than her husband?

Some of the white characters certainly are haters of blacks if that is what the reviewer means. On the other hand there are other people-- I'm thinking now of a white woman who hires Winnie for a position-- who are sympathetic toward her and her cause.  I still do no know why I  should not like the song that ends the movie. And it did not appear to me that the director dances around Ms. Mandela's involvement in the death of the young man perceived as a traitor. I thought Mr. Roodt lets the viewer see the transition that takes place in Ms. Mandela. She is portrayed  not as a cardboard character but as a complex human being. And  I'm not sure how most of us would react if a spouse spent 27 years in prison for  believing in freedom for all people.

Finally the gorgeous panoramic scenes reminded me that, yes, South Africa is beautiful.

I'd give this film an A-. It was a good way to spend two hours of my precious life.",1379635200,29,2786,4.455621301775148
