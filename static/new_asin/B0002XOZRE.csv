8034228,5,B0002XOZRE,"I am, I realised a long time ago, a 'grumpy old man' trapped in (increasingly less) youthful flesh. In fact, whilst a lot of people bemoan the loss of their youth, I personally cannot wait to be shot of the bloody thing so that my exterior artifice finally matches my interior landscape and people can finally regard me as the cantankerous, curmudgeonly old sod that I am, and have, in fact, always been.

I could go into numerous examples of my grumpiness - the fact that I am personally affronted by newsreaders who do not wear ties is one such example; The secretly nursed and increasingly overwhelming desire to don a raincoat and trilby and stalk the night-time streets waylaying young men sporting those ridiculous ""mussed up"" Gen-Y hair-do's in order to attack them with a set of clippers and a comb is another; my hatred of iphones, pointless consumer technology, television in general, shops that ask for your phone number and useless, useless health and safety legislation are all numerous other examples - as my other half, Mrs. Lordzden, who has to endure the brunt of my rants these days, bless her, can only too willingly attest.

It is for this reason that I experienced an almost 'Road To Damascus' style epiphany when I first observed the BBC television series, ""Grumpy Old Men"", when it first aired back in 2003, and realised, after hearing many of my own views espoused through the mouths of my slightly wrinklier compatriots, that I was not actually an ""angry young man"" (as many people had insisted throughout my youth) but that I was, in fact, ""a grumpy old one"" who was just slightly ahead of the curve.

If you're a grumpy old man (and even if you're not), watching the likes of Rick Wakeman, Rory McGrath, Arthur Smith, Bob Geldof, Will Self, the late John Peel (RIP), Ken Stott, Richard Madeley and Jeremy Clarkson venting their hatred of the likes of modern media, nouvelle cuisine, the nanny state, aloof restaurants, mobile phones, low-rider jeans, yoof culture, lifestyle gurus, dogs and other people's children can become as addictive a drug as Heroin and, if you're anything like me, will lead to instances of you pumping your fist in the air in solidarity whilst yelling, ""Yes! Finally! Someone else understands!!"" across the room at your long-suffering significant other.

Contrary to what the odious lifestyle gurus of this world will tell you, having a bloody good whinge is one of the healthiest and most cathartic acts that we can undertake as human beings - and in the interest of health, I advise you to check out this series as it's quite the funniest piece of observational comedy to be broadcast in years.",1254787200,2,2648,4.800438596491228
