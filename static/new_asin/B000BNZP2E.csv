No matter what your level of fitness or coordination, you will feel alive and full of joy after completing Radiant Heart Groove.

If I (overweight and over 40) can joyfully engage in this program, you can too! I highly recommend it as an integral part to any body, mind, and spirit program.",1135900800,,447,4.5875

8348416,5,B000BNZP2E,"I never considered myself able to to dance or move beautifully until

I met Leela. Under her conscious guidance, regardless of age or

ability, movement becomes simple and simply irresistable. Radiant

Heart Groove is a dynamic senuous moving meditation; a journey of

physcial exploration through the senses and relationship with our

planet. I highly recommend this beautiful and Soulful DVD of physical

fascination and fun!",1130803200,,427,5.492307692307692
