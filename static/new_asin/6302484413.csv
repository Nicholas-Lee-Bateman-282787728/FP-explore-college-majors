The musical score is just terrible. Yves doesn't  have chemistry with Marilyn at all! This is the kind of film MM didn't  want to make.
Marilyn is her old self only in the films last scenes: she looks good and finally comes alive as the action turns to her character at last.

470373,4,6302484413,"Let's Make Love, from 1960, is not one of Marilyn Monroe's better-known productions. It is a later career effort from Monroe, and an effort that unfortunately falls flat, for the most part, anyway. If you know anything about Marilyn, you know she didn't want to make Let's Make Love, and that she did it only as a fulfillment of her 20th Century-Fox contract. Fox had the upper hand, and Marilyn had no choice but to do the movie, whether she wanted to or not. The studio was eager to cash-in on Some Like It Hot (1959), which was a major success for Monroe, and they were also anxious to updating the musical film genre which had been fading in popularity for years. Even though Marilyn was obligated to do the movie, she still had it stated, in her contract, that she could make changes. She got her latest hubby Arthur Miller to rewrite the script so more emphasis was given to her character, the title was changed from The Billionaire to Let's Make Love, and she chose George Cukor as the director. Gregory Peck refused the male lead after Miller's rewrite; Rock Hudson, Cary Grant, Charlton Heston and others turned it down also. French actor Yves Montand was the next choice, who had recently been successful on Broadway in his one-man show. Montand was approved by Monroe and Cukor and was cast.

Now that I've given a brief overview on the history of Let's Make Love, I'll now get down to reviewing the film itself. Jean-Marc Clement (Yves Montand) is a wealthy businessman from a long line of wealthy businessmen within his family. Clement learns from his associate, Coffman (Tony Randall), that he is going to be parodied in a forthcoming off-Broadway play. Curious, Clement decides to take a trip to the little theatre. There, he becomes dazzled by Amanda Dell (Monroe), a actress in the play. He decides to introduce himself to her, but tells her his name is ""Alexandre Dumas"" and that he's a struggling actor. While there, Clement, as ""Alexandre"", is picked to play Clement in the play. Clement tries to win Amanda over, but she seems preoccupied with the theatre's dashing comedian/singer, Tony Danton (Frankie Vaughan). Clement later enlists the help of three well-known stars; Milton Berle teaches him to be funny, Gene Kelly helps him learn to dance, and Bing Crosby coaches his vocals. However, despite their training, Clement still lacks talent. Near the end of the movie, Amanda learns that the man she knew as ""Alexandre Dumas"" is the real ""Jean-Marc Clement"". What happens from there, you'll have to watch and see. I'm not going to give away the end. Sorry.

Let's Make Love isn't a bad movie (I've seen worse, I guarantee you!), but is by far not Marilyn's best. One of the main things that irritated me about this movie is how long it is; it's a minute or two shy of having a running time of two hours. That wouldn't be so bad if there was more plot. The plot is so thin and too under-developed, so there's a lot of ""filler"" placed here and there. There are many scenes with Marilyn and Yves Montand just sitting around talking about things they don't really progress the story. I will admit the story was interesting, or interesting enough that is. The ""mistaken identity"" thing was hot at the time; Pillow Talk (1959), starring Doris Day and Rock Hudson, had made millions off the gimmick, and Fox wanted to make even more with Let's Make Love. Critics in 1960 weren't too kind to Let's Make Love at all, but modern reviews have been somewhat more positive. The film currently holds a 67% ""Fresh"" rating of Rotten Tomatoes. That's not too bad actually, especially some other so-called ""classic movies"" aren't that highly rated.

Another thing that bothers me about Let's Make Love is that Marilyn's role is considerably small. Although she gets top billing, she is basically just the eye candy for Yves Montand and Frankie Vaughan. Her character doesn't really develop, she's just there doing whatever she's doing, which really isn't all that much. Her best moment comes when we first see her, performing Cole Porter's ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"". Of course, she's as beautiful as ever, but she seems out of place. You can tell there were desperate attempts to making this a ""hip"" movie. There are Elvis impersonators, beatnik-like guys, and other oddballs characters that gives this movie an uneven feeling. Marilyn doesn't belong in a movie like this. She definitely deserved better.

I do recommend Let's Make Love, but only if you're a die-hard Marilyn Monroe fan. If your a fan of classic musicals or romances, you'll find better entertainment elsewhere. This movie is enjoyable enough, but you'll find yourself wanting to fast forward through some of the pointless chatter scenes. I myself have only watched the movie, from start-to-finish, once, and it'll probably be some time before I do it again. I don't want to discourage anyone from giving this movie a shot, but I just want to make it known that it will not be everyone's cup of tea. I've given it four stars. The movie itself only gets three really (because it was ""okay"" in my opinion), but I gave it an extra star because Marilyn's in it, and I am a die-hard fan of hers. I couldn't see myself given one of her films lower than four stars. Recommended.",1448409600,,5245,4.735229759299781

470430,3,6302484413,"LET'S MAKE LOVE (1960) is not a horrible movie, but it's so downright irritating that few people who see it come away humming the tunes that a movie musical should have inspired them to do.  First of all, it's too long, right at two hours when the kind of formulaic Prince-and-Pauper(ess) screwball plot was honed down to a mere 85 to 90 minutes in the days before Technicolor and CinemaScope.  There are too many scenes of Marilyn (aspiring actress) speaking with Yves Montand (billionaire pretending to be aspiring actor):  the pace is glacial and they have no particular chemistry.  It is hard to believe that the same George Cukor who directed THE WOMEN in 1940 with all its wisecracking wit should have turned the heat so far down for this one.

Along with that, so many of the ideas are trite and dated that they don't deserve the worshipful treatment given here.  This 1960 feature has Montand receiving lessons in comedy from Milton Berle, dancing lessons from Gene Kelly and singing lessons from Bing Crosby.  Never mind that NBC was holding Milton Berle off the entertainment market through an exclusive contract, or that neither Kelly nor Crosby had had a hit movie since about 1956.  If the folks at Fox had wanted the best of their respective entertainment fields in 1960, they'd have better gone with the likes of Mort Sahl, Bob Fosse and Bobby Darrin.  But that would have required youthful thinking of a kind that seems to have completely escaped the makers of this misfire.  If you want to see why ""old Hollywood"" was losing its audience in an era of mass television and the rising Boomers, LET'S MAKE LOVE provides the answer.

Ironically, the plot centers around the efforts of a troupe in Greenwich Village trying to put on one of those ""little"" satirical revues.  It begins promisingly enough, with Marilyn, adorably cuddly in a lavender cable-knit sweater, vamping through ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy.""  She's fine, but what a bunch of downtown hipsters would be doing revving up a 1938 Cole Porter song that was Mary Martin's claim to fame is a question I can't answer.  And it goes downhill from there.  Most annoying of all is the song probably meant to anchor the romance, a number called ""I'm Incurably Romantic,"" which unfortunately is a near-steal of ""I'm Romantic"" in many significant ways besides the title.  (Jerome Kern's estate should have sued.)  The film boasts great side talent, including Tony Randall and Wilfrid Hyde-White, but this just goes to show that putting ""name"" talent behind and in front of the camera will not produce fresh entertainment if there's nothing new to be said.  Of course, you'll enjoy Marilyn Monroe's performance, but you may certainly wonder why this albatross couldn't have been more agile, like her hit musical comedy with Jane Russell from 1953, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES.

470432,2,6302484413,"This is probably Marilyn Monroe's worst film as a star, and she's one of the reasons--but only one. The first is the script; the plot basically follows the Doris Day/Rock Hudson sex comedy outline of the time: the man tries to get the girl (who is predisposed to despise him) by pretending to be someone else; the comedy comes out him trying to maintain the impersonation, she falls in love with the fake him, eventually discovers the real him, hates him then loves him, fadeout.

It's a calculated, mechanical formula, and for it to work at all it has to be constructed and filmed that way--sharp, shiny-bright and plasticized. But the script blurs things by making the billionaire not a cad (as Hudson always was) who's only interested in getting the girl into bed and then falling for her. From the beginning he's besotted with Monroe, which eliminates the mechanistic tension and conflict. And the resolution is limply lazy; there's no twist or definite marker to show why Monroe forgives him; he just starts crooning sexily and she melts.

All of this is compounded by Cukor's direction, which absurdly tries to give us a gritty, bohemian, ""realistic"" view of the Greenwich Village theater scene, which just puts a drab blanket over things, goes against the cold, heartless pacing this kind of movie needs to work at all, and can't be sustained anyway, given that the play the theater group is putting on is clearly not the underground satire on the rich we're told it is, but merely a sub-Broadway musical comedy with glitzy-tacky production numbers.

Poor Marilyn is strike three. It's an awful performance; Monroe, when used well and carefully, could be effective, but as is glaringly exposed here, she utterly lacked the professional resources to pull off routinely straightforward and crisp line readings and reactions. The scene when she discovers the billionaire's ruse is cringingly amateurish;  any third-string contract player from the era would have been able to snap out the (bad) dialogue with easy, practiced smoothness, and to pull off the basic, easy facial expressions needed for the uncomplicated emotions involved. She is bleary, vague, stumbling, wanderingly out of focus. When she yields to the guy's advances in the elevator, I could see a legal question arising on the issue of competence to give informed consent.

Unfunny, draggy, trying to be different things and failing at all of them, viewing should be reserved for MM fanatics ticking items off their checklist.",1399420800,2,2496,5.033898305084746

470469,3,6302484413,"For a Marilyn Monroe film, ""Let's Make Love"" is strangely devoid of any close-ups of its star. Although she is attractive as ever, (although a little pastier and plumper than usual), George Cukor's camera seems afraid somehow to get close to her, and she appears only in wide and medium shots throughout. This proves exasperating, especially since the plot is wafer-thin and the film offers little else of interest besides Monroe. The musical numbers are flat and lightyears away from ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" or even the songs Sugar Kane sings in ""Some Like It Hot'. There is something lifeless about this movie and the camera seems to have fallen momentarily out of love with her. Monroe herself seems equally disenchanted, and there is something tired and lackluster about her presence here--her characteristic vitality is absent. Perhaps her offscreen troubles (insomnia, etc) were beginning to encroach on her performances (although she certainly gained back all her vibrancy and more in the never-finished ""Something's Got To Give"" three years later).

That said, ""Let's Make Love"" is not entirely a failure. The plot, which is a kind of twist on ""The Prince and Pauper"" (girl mistakes billionaire for his own poor look-alike and he goes along with it to win her heart--will he be found out before the plan can work?) is mildly entertaining, and Monroe--even at her worst--is always compelling, even from the great distances imposed here by the camerawork.  The film does seem overlong with too many (mediocre) production numbers, the exception of course being ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy', although I'd still take Lorelei Lee any day.

Marilyn's persona here is in transition from the baby-voiced cupie she minted in her earlier characterizations to the Actor's Studio method actress she was trying to become (and the complicated person she ultimately was, which had begun to inhabit her characterizations starting with ""Bus Stop"" and ""The Prince and the Showgirl""). Her voice is a little more natural  than the one she is remembered for, and it's nice to see her beginning to ""grow up"". It's just too bad the material was so average and that the camera films her with no more regard than it does the background set.

The film's title is ironic since its two stars had an extra-marital affair while filming it (Monroe was married to Arthur Miller at the time, Montand to actress Simone Signoret). This ended badly, and perhaps contributes to Monroe's problematic performance here. For his part, Montand seem a slightly ill-fit for such a beatnik-style musical (Monroe too for that matter. She is just a little too old--and too quintessentially 1950's-- to comfortably pull off the  doo-be-dooby-do wop"" jazzy numbers).  It's too bad that ""Something's Got to Give"" was never finished, as surviving footage from that film proves Marilyn was finding a more age-appropriate image that would have worked for her in the 60's.

Interesting as a curiosity piece, but to my mind not the kind of movie you'll want to watch over and over. Even ""The Misfits"" has more rewatchability than this film. If you crave latter-day Marilyn, stick with ""Some Like it Hot, ""Bus Stop"", and ""Prince and the Showgirl"", any of which reveals a more complex actress at work, to much greater effect.",1371686400,,3286,5.0275735294117645

Surprising that is until we examine the whys and wherefores.

Right at the outset, Monroe, who was slated to appear opposite Gregory Peck, demanded rewrites. During these star-imposed delays, Peck encountered other obligations and he bowed out of the production. Next, several leading men flatly turned the film down, including Jimmy Stewart, Chuck Heston, Bill Holden, Yul Brynner, Rock Hudson and Cary Grant. When director George Cukor suggested to Marilyn that they hire the unknown-in-America Yves Montand, she happily agreed with the choice. This was almost the last time star and director would work together harmoniously-- they never even spoke to each other while filming.

Sadly, Monroe's dual addictions to alcohol and barbiturates are both plainly evident in the finished work. In some scenes she's obviously glassy-eyed and dull-witted; in others so bloated as to appear 20 lbs. heavier than in the previous shot. Her talent remained intact though: MM's performance of Cole Porter's ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"" remains among her very best, while a warm on-screen rapport with both Montand and Frankie Vaughan seems genuine.

The English-born Vaughan was a popular crooner in his native land but never caught on in America. A pity, for he had a marvelous voice-- similar to Tony Bennett's, a bit rougher perhaps but with more power and clarity. His rendition of ""Incurably Romantic"" on SONY's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LET-S-MAKE-LOVE/dp/B00009KU82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LET'S MAKE LOVE</a>&nbsp;soundtrack CD is strikingly beautiful. (This entire album is highly recommended, for it contains complete true stereo takes of songs heard only partially in the film.)

MOVIE SYNOPSIS--
Billionaire Jean-Marc Clement (Montand) learns he's to be spoofed in an off-Broadway show, so he goes to the rehearsals where he's mistakenly hired to play himself. After seeing her perform ""Daddy,"" Clement falls hard for star Amanda Dell (Monroe), and to impress her (and win the lady's heart) Jean-Marc hires three famous performers to teach him how to tell jokes, sing and dance. Amanda does eventually warm up to this supposedly struggling bit player. When he finally admits the truth to her, Jean-Marc cannot get Amanda to believe he really IS the fabulously wealthy industrialist.

""Let's Make Love"" is a pleasant story draped around several wonderful numbers that's far better than first-run audiences gave it credit for.  (TRIVIA: The Elvis-clone is played by ""King of the Surf Guitar,"" Dick Dale.)

470484,3,6302484413,"Sometimes a star shines brightest when everything around them is a black hole. Such is the case with this film.  The direction is inept, and the screenplay is laboriously unfunny to the point of pain. No one comes out of this sad enterprise with any dignity or charm except Marilyn Monroe--but does she ever.

She shows you why her legend still burns so brightly.  It is possibly one of her most natural, and therefore best, performances.  Her scene with Yves Montand in a restaurant is a master class in deft comedy, subtle reactions, and pitch-perfect timing. Her musical numbers don't require more than her usual cooing sex kittenishness, but she makes them both more fun and more provocative than anyone else probably could.

The costumes she wears are a standout and work well with her fuller figure.  Whether it's the covered-up-but-super-hot sweater and high heels combo of ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy,"" the creamy trenchcoat and sapphire beret she wears on a walk, or the bronzey-green dress she chooses for a night out, she looks wonderful and remarkably fresh.  Most of those outfits would still work today.

Marilyn and her wardrobe make this movie worth the watching.",1348617600,3,1178,4.944162436548224
470485,4,6302484413,"Jean Marc-Clement (Yves Montand), a rich businessman discovers that he is going to be satirized in an off-Broadway theater, goes to see the crew and comes across Amanda Dell (Marilyn Monroe) and instantly smitten by her beauty and performing skills. With her pale blonde hair and younger looks, Marilyn Monroe is more beautiful in this movie than in other movies made in 1950's. The director of the show thinks that Jean Marc is an actor, and he reluctantly casts him as a member of the show. Montand with his heavy French accent tries hard to serenade Amanda by pretending that he is just a working actor named Alexander Dumas. Soon Jean Marc falls in love with Amanda, but gets stuck with false identity and unable to reveal his true identity.  It is tempting to suggest that this movie is a thinly-veiled portrait of billionaire William Randolph Hearst and actress Marion Davies. Hearst meets Davies during her performance in the movie ""Zeigfeld Follies"" of 1916 (silent movie), and falls in love with her.

Many reviewers gave moderate rating after comparing this movie with Monroe's other successful performances in; ""Some Like It Hot,"" ""Seven year itch,"" ""How to marry a millionaire"" and ""Gentleman prefer blondes."" The truth is Monroe was frail in her personal life and had severe addiction to prescription drugs. She also had marital problems with her husband Arthur Miller and a brief affair with co-star Yves Montand that impacted her performance in this movie. The script also went through many revisions by writer Arthur Miller. Marilyn Monroe wanted the movie to focus on her and lift her career few more notches. Gregory Peck was offered the role of leading actor and he turns down the role knowing that this is too focused on Marilyn Monroe. Subsequently, the job was offered to Rock Hudson who also tuned it down. Eventually the role went to the Frenchman, Yves Montand.  George Cukor, one of the brilliant director's of Hollywood did his best to make this more interesting, but he had difficulty dealing with Marilyn Monroe. She was very temperamental on the set and frequently missed the film shooting schedule. Other cast members offered weak support; Yves Montand did not do an impressive job.  Frankie Vaughan, as the whining crooner, is no match for Monroe. Tony Randall as the assistant of Montand offers a fine performance with his usual cool comedy.

This movie is known for some of the best music; Cole Porter's classic ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy,"" jazzy themes like; ""Let's Make Love"" and ""Incurably Romantic"" were also well staged and performed.  Marilyn sings and dances beautifully, and while singing ""Incurably Romantic,"" her dress flies up, almost like in ""The Seven-Year Itch."" The cameo appearances by Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly, respectively as the comedy, music and dance instructor's of Montand are well thought of and some of the best comedy writing is found here.  Few interesting quotes are as follows:
Jean-Marc Clement: Show me what I can do with a woman.
Milton Berle: After what I've read about you, I'm sure that you could show me.

Milton Berle: you know, between comedians and singers, women always go for singers.

Bing Crosby: [moves his hand in a sweeping motion] Ya see; that's showmanship. Keeps her mind off your voice

Gene Kelly: A dancer expresses with his body what an actor does with words. It's not just the feet.

I've always been a fan of Marilyn's, so I finally figured I'd give it a shot - and man, I'm glad I did! I simply loved this movie! I thought Marilyn did a great job, the story was adorable, and I loved the cameos of Milton Berle, Gene Kelly, & Bing Crosby! Now granted, Yves Montand didn't seem right to play Marilyn's love interest. He seemed too old for her, but I was surprised when I looked his bio up and found out he was only 5 years her senior. As the movie played, I will he admit he started to grow on me. The ending was just great (I won't give it away), and the musical numbers were quite pleasant. I'm still surprised that the reviews for this film were not as favorable as I felt they should've been. Bus Stop got great reviews, and it was not my favorite film. I found the character ""Bo"" to be quite annoying. To each his own I guess? Buy ""Let's Make Love.""",1336003200,5,988,4.178010471204188

470524,4,6302484413,"Monroe and Montand seem an unlikely coupling. But they pull it off and suck you in.

In the scene where Monroe sings ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"", Marilyn slides down a stripper pole 40 years before it was fashionable... and starts out.... ""Boys! My name is Lolita, and ah... I'm not supposed to play... with boys!"" "".... My heart belongs to Daddy so I simply couldn't be bad."" "".. cuz Daddy, my Daddy. My little old Daddy, he treats it so.... That little old man he just treats it SO GOOOOOOOOD!""

The last line is delivered in such a way that one blushes at what is really being said and wondering who that little old man really is! Erotic and distrubing all at once, especially in light of Marilyn's real life fixation on her absentee father and the molestation she was subjected to. The eroticism in this scene cannot be rivaled by any modern day film. The song itself has such taboo insinuations it's a bit shocking even by today's standards.

I think we can credit Ms. Monroe with currently overused phrase, ""Who's Your Daddy?!""

SHE's YOUR Daddy! ;o)

There are very nice cameo appearances by Bing Crosby, Milton Berle, & Gene Kelly playing themselves... Frankie Vaughan is dreamy. Montand seems out of place but does a good job with what he has to work with.

See the film just to enjoy the cameos, or to watch Monroe perform a piece ahead of it's time in content. ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"" is just plain bizarre...see Marilyn ""scatting"" !",1219881600,2,1448,4.571428571428571
470525,3,6302484413,"I stumbled across the DVD for ""Let's Make Love"" in one of those midnight rambles over the web - the ones where I start off searching ""How High the Moon"", clink links until, suddenly, I've got happy  snaps of the New York Roxy and CinemaScope and end up, well, with Marilyn. ""Let's Make Love"" is not available here (Australia) for love or ready cash, and hasn't been, and perhaps won't be for a long time.

I've got the oldest copy in the world on VHS and yes, it's not one of her best; and yes, she's put on a bit of weight; and yes, George Cukor's flabby direction, the rotten script, the woeful editing don't make anybody look good. The sleazy charms of M. Montand and the almost talent-free Frankie Vaughan's immense self-satisfaction... but the main reason I've ordered it with great glee not ten minutes ago is to see Marilyn - especially to see her originate pole-dancing with ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"". And that, for me, is reason enough. Mary Martin must have been (as we say down here) SPEWING.

She's amazing. It doesn't matter whether you're a fan or not - if she's on the screen you're not looking at anybody else, and that's star quality.

Interesting that another reviewer of this film mentioned ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" with something south of pleasure. If you ever puzzle about the difference between Acting and acting, this is a great spot to start. Watch the Brits, especially the atrrrrociously mannerrrred Larrrry Olivier, sink slowly in the west, and then compare his silly posturing to the effortless ease of Monroe's style. ""Won't you come down, my dear? You're the only one of us who knows how to do it.""

Let's not mention ""There's No Business Like Show Business""...

Next: ""Niagara"". Delirious!",1217462400,,1727,4.701986754966887
470526,5,6302484413,"The fantastic musical numbers alone make this movie worth watching at least a hundred times and Monroe's being in them is 90% of the reason why. Frankie Vaughn is great in all his musical numbers with Marilyn and Montand did an amazing job in his first English role, shifting smoothly between scenes with a more serious tone and ridiculous comic scenes. And 'Lack of Chemistry' between Montand and Monroe? Not so. You can very much feel the connection between them but it's a deeper chemistry born out of a true appreciation of each other's artistry rather than the common surface chemistry. This deeper transcending connection of the real people acting the parts is there for all who can pay close attention veiled behind what the parts themselves call for which is 'lack of chemstry' between them and Montand's silly attempts to impress her and create a connection. We slowly watch the surface-movie-parts chemistry and the sexual tension develop while the movie gets most of its laughs from making Montand look ridiculous--at the same time the deeper underlying chemistry being always at work whenever they share the screen.

Monroe was in more or as many scenes here as in ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Seven Year Itch.""  Whether Monroe initially hated the part she was given to do by Fox under contract--or not, is a moot point since it does not show through one bit in the role. She rises above any misgivings to deliver maybe her best performance after ""Bus Stop,""  her most fully realistic, reality based comic role, a further demonstration of the remarkable acting talent that was struggling to be recognized amidst all the sex-symbol hoopla. In all the non-musical scenes, she refuses to play the dumb blonde caricature and instead plays a real woman, close to what she was like in real life, one whose intelligence and wit shows through and all the comic nuances she adds are firmly rooted in and arise from that base and not some two-dimensional cliche. She's been through a lot by this point and has acquired quite a bit of 'soul' and taps into it regularly without over-playing that angle and overpowering the light comic tone of the film.

The writing has plenty of wit to spare for every scene and the directing is expert and very detailed. One of the best scenes in the movie doesn't even involve any of the principal leads and features a hilarious attempt by the nearly bankrupt theatre manager to bluff his way into a better bargaining position against Montand's secret representative who is ready to pay his debts for a share of the business. I also love how they absurdly stretch the ending out with Montand saying repeatedly that he's Clement and Monroe refusing to believe it even all the way up to his office and in front of his secretaries because she thinks that his obsessive dedication to acting the part of Clement has driven him so much into the character that he's stuck in it and can't escape! Just the fact that they even conceived of and wrote a scene like that and Cukor got Montand and Monroe to subtly act it to perfection makes this movie unique and special among the comedy/musicals.

The DVD transfer is excellent but there are no special features other than a couple of trailers.",1208908800,7,3214,4.752688172043011
470527,4,6302484413,"Let's Make Love is, sadly, not one of Marilyn Monroe's better films. I feel bad about it because apparently this film was essentially a contractual obligation and Yves Montand doesn't even look right for her onscreen--I find it hard to picture the off-screen... oh, oh, well.

Anyway, the action begins when the French billionaire Jean-Marc Clement (Yves Montand) finds out his life and playboy scandals are being publicly spoofed in an off-Broadway play. Upset about the possibility of negative press, Jean-Marc hurries down to the theater with his main PR man Alexander Coffman (Tony Randall). Naturally, he does find out he IS being made fun of--but his worries are sidetracked when he lays his eyes on Amanda Dell (Monroe), the female lead in the show.

Jean-Marc and his associates set things up so that he can masquerade as an actor to be closer to Amanda; and as time goes by Jean-Marc forgets about his reputation being slandered. He only wants Amanda for his wife. Of course, the fact that Amanda is involved with another actor named Tony (Frankie Vaughan) doesn't help much.

Look for some wonderful songs by Frankie Vaughan; and Marilyn at least scores one big one with her song and dance classic number, ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy."" It's not that she looks tired in this film; it's that she's grossly underused. That surprises me because George Cukor, the director, was particularly well known for bringing out the best acting from his leading ladies during production.

After several silly plot twists, Jean-Marc realizes he's got to hire some professionals to help him get Amanda's attention. We therefore get some wonderful cameos by Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly. They do a wonderful job although Milton Berle wasn't as funny as I hoped he would be.

Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. Will Jean-Marc ever disclose his true identity to Amanda--and how will she react when she knows he's been a faker all this time? How will Tony handle it if Amanda leaves him for Jean-Marc? Watch the movie and find out--I don't give plot spoilers!

The DVD has a couple of interesting but very brief comparisons between what the film looked like pre-restoration and after restoration; but that's about it. Sigh.

Overall, Let's Make Love is a tepid motion picture to be saved for when there's nothing good on television and you want to see a Marilyn Monroe movie. The acting is only fair; in fact Montand looks more weathered than Marilyn! It's a good movie; but nothing that you should go too far out of your way to see.

470529,2,6302484413,"I wish I could say I really loved this movie.  I really do.  Personally, I don't think I've ever seen Marilyn look sexier than she does with her romp through Cole Porter's ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"", in that blue sweater and black stockings.  Yowza !!  And I like her with that little bit of extra weight !  But now, onto the movie.  It, quite frankly, stinks.  As other reviewers have noted, there is no on-screen chemistry between Yves Montand and Marilyn, which, also noted, is wierd for a couple that had a brief, off-screen affair.  The story itself of a French billionaire falling for an off-Broadway actress who apears in a musical that portrays him in an unflattering light...well, let's just say it's not very believable.  Marilyn seems to realize herself that the script itself is weak; it often seems like she is sleepwalking through her lines.  Tony Randall is completely wasted.  George Cukor's direction seems uncertain; it seems as though he and the rest of the crew walked away during those long, suffering, boring, close-up romantic conversations between Montand and MM that dominate the film because they realized the script stunk and there were no sparks on-screen whatsoever.  And that cinematography...it seems like every time they show Marilyn, someone smeared Vaseline on the lens to give her a sort of ""being in a fog"" look, even though her beauty does shine through.

In the end, though, this is one of Marilyn's weakest films.  Good to know that she bounced back wonderfully in her next - and last - outing, John Huston's 'The Misfits'.  Makes you wonder how 'Something's Got to Give' would have turned out had she lived.",1163635200,5,1648,4.835714285714285
470530,2,6302484413,"It is interesting to watch this film because it is M.M.'s second to last (completed) film.  She was a BIG star when it was made!

As an entertaining movie, it is a dud.  But to watch her work, scene for scene, She is wonderful!  Watch the way she moves her body when she dances.  She gyrates, she shimmies...and yeah,though she was somewhat overweight in this film she shows herself off with sensuality and abandon. I would bet she was feeling insecure about her weigh during filming. I do know that her (3rd)marriage was crumbling and she was 33 years old at the time. Remember...she just couldn't make it to the set alot of days...personal demons.

Watch her act.  The Actors Studio stuff is here.  See her try to give more meaning to some of her lines...tries to dig deeper then she needed to.  (The dressing room scene where she tells the story of Abe Lincoln and the scene in the resturant with Montand.)

Look at her react while Frankie Vaughan sings ""Crazy Eyes"" to her.  She doesn't say a word but she is marvelous!  She loves the camera and the camera loves her.  She is so cute in this scene.

Her hair is bad in this film.  The continuity rarely matches from one scene to the next. Her costumes were probably racy in 1960 but are just awful today.  Why did they put her in that bulky sweater for her first number?  Makes her look bulky.

Oh well.  She looked better in her next film, ""The Misfits"".

And she slayed them whenever she appeared in her uncompleted ""Something's Got To Give"".  She lost all of the weight she exibits in ""Lets Make Love"" and appeared with no costume at all in her famous pool scene.

470531,3,6302484413,"When ""Let's Make Love"" was first released by Twentieth Century Fox in 1960, it was eagerly awaited because of the original teaming of superstar Marilyn Monroe with the French actor Yves Montand.  Directed by the legendary George Cukor, who certainly could handle musical comedies as his work on the 1954 ""A Star Is Born"" and the 1964 ""My Fair Lady"" demonstrates, there was every reason to believe this would be a very entertaining film.

However, even in 1960, when the film seemed rather daring in many ways, it was just not quite as good as one had hoped.  Looking at it again, after many years, this writer had hopes that there might be something I missed when I first saw it.  Sadly, the film misfires on a number of things.  The magic between Monroe and Montand is just not there, and that's remarkable because we all heard about their offscreen love affair (which Montand's wife, actress Simone Signoret, tolerated, believing it would quickly end as it actually did).  Nevertheless, one can see glimpses of the talents of both stars and I still remain impressed with Montand's very capable dancing and his competent singing.

Marilyn seldom looked as beautiful and sexy as she did in this film.  Her costumes were quite sensational in 1960.  Her hair had been changed to the popular bouffant style of the time.  Her best singing in the film is in an updated version of the Cole Porter classic, ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy.""  Her voice, however, had become increasingly husky and it often made it hard to understand the lyrics of the songs written for the movie, including the title song.

In the story, Montand's character is aided by Milton Berle, Bing Crosby, and Gene Kelly, in rather delightful cameos.  They try to help him with his comedy, his singing, and his dancing and, typical of Hollywood magic, he does succeed in impressing Monroe's character, who is so taken with singer Frankie Vaughan.  However, it is still difficult to believe that she would actually drop Vaughan for Montand, despite learning the truth that he really IS a billionaire.  By the way, I was quite impressed with Vaughan's smooth, sophisticated singing.

Almost lost in the shuffle with the wonderful Tony Randall, who did so well in dealing with another Fox sexpot, Jayne Mansfield, in ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter.""  Randall turned in one of his typically delightful performances, as he tried to help Montand in his efforts to attract Monroe.

This film proved to be the last production that Marilyn Monroe completed for Twentieth Century Fox, where she had made most of her films.  It was followed by the intriguing drama ""The Misfits,"" directed by John Huston, the only time she worked with Clark Gable (in his very last film), and another musical comedy at Fox, ""Something's Gotta Give,"" also directed by Cukor.  It has been well-documented how Monroe's increasing dependency on prescription drugs interferred with her work and led Fox to fire her, only to reconsider it just before she died in early August 1962, at the age of 36.",1153353600,11,3027,4.852140077821011
470532,5,6302484413,"Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand are delightful in this romantic comedy supported by Tony Randall, Wilfred Hyde White and Frankie Vaughn (a great talent who became a big star in his native England). The musical numbers are fun but the real pleasure is the interaction between Monroe and Montand. The actors, particularly Montand, play their roles ""straight"" rather than as cartoon characters which allows the quality of the screen play to come through.

The one part of the film that seemed gratuitous was the part that had Montand's character ""tutored"" by Milton Berle, Gene Kelly, and Bing Crosby. However the film survives this detour and succeeds anyway.

""Let's make love"" was fit for #2 (which is how I first saw it,) yet has follen a victim to #1.

I had first seen ""Let's make love"" on TV and found it rather entertaining and found the characters likable, maybe even lovable. I could relate to Clement (not for having all that money but) his feeling for the Monroe character. The scene where I could most relate to him is when the cast of the musical is notified that the musical doesn't have to worry about money anymore, with that Monroe gives a BIG graciouse hug to her friend Toney (NOT Clement [Yves Montand]) the look on Clement's face is a pretty anguished one.

Others don't like this film because of the supporting role Marilyn has, it's rather arguable if her role was a supporting one or not. Yet if this is a supporting role for her it shouldn't really be a bad thing, let's face it, Monroe's best film's have her in (do I dare say it:) supporting rules,  such as ""The Seven Year Itche,"" there is only four major segments of the film she is in (five at the most), and in ""Some Like it Hot,"" the audiance has to wait a lenthy thirty minutes (the waiting is made easier by a chaming Toney Curtis & Jack Lemon) until we see Marilyn.

He is smitten and because this is a comedy, he is mistaken for a Clement impersonator and hired by Oliver Burton, head of the production.  Also, because this is a comedy and an eye-rolling one at that, he takes the name Alexander Dumas.  Both Dumas pere and fils were probably churning in their graves at that one.
He learns that Amanda doesn't like Clement one bit.  ""I heard they're going to make a real idiot out of him"" she says, also saying of him he's a rich louse.  Insulted, he tells her off, but she, clueless of his real identity, praises him by saying it's a perfect impression of Clement, which mollifies him.  He tries to get closer to Amanda by trying to get her help on acting technique and asking her out.  She on her part is friendly and encouraging, but she's taking night classes to get what would today be a GED.  Worse for him, she's the girlfriend of song and dance man Tony Danton, played by Frankie Vaughan, whom he is definitely jealous of.
Clement lacks show business talent and through his PR man Alexander Coffman, gets a joke from Lamont, played by ex-Three Stooge Joe Besser, which backfires.  Hiring Milton Berle, Bing Crosby, and Gene Kelly (who play themselves in guest cameos) for comedy, singing, and dancing.
The rehearsal for the ""Specialization"" number is humiliating for Clement.  After all, Clement is known as a notorious womanizer, and to his chagrin, he is forced to accompany the line ""crow from the barnyard roost"" by cockle-doodle-dooing like a real rooster.  Others roasted in this number are Maria Callas, Elvis Presley, and pianist Van Cliburn, which is a snapshot of who was big in 1960.
The best observation on human nature comes from Coffman, who learning that the theatre has been demanded a year's rent in advance and that the theatre's real estate firm belongs to Clement, asks the bartender for three double bourbons, then goes into this bitter spiel.  ""Somebody once said that rich people are only poor people with money.  Well, he was lying.  Rich people aren't people, my friend.  Oh, they can be charming, democratic, polite.  You can hardly tell them from a human being sometimes.  Just be good and sure you don't cross them.""
Another good insight is a conversation between Coffman and Clement.  When people talk to Clement, they don't talk to him, they talk to his money, hence Coffman's calling him ""sir.""  The importance of distinguishing people from their money is noted here.
Apart from the Cole Porter number, the other numbers are forgettable.  This is far from MM or Yves Montand's most memorable performances.  Montand is miscast in this part, and it's understandable why celebrities ranging from Gregory Peck, Cary Grant, Yul Brynner, and James Stewart turned it down.  All in all, a waste of talent given the cast involved, including Tony Randall, Wilfrid Hyde-White, and director George Cukor.
Critics panned this and wrote off Monroe's career, even saying she was putting on some pounds.  However, the script, idea, dialogue, lack of likeable characters (except Amanda and Coffman) and lack of oomph are more to blame.  MM was trying to breathe life into a movie doomed from the start and did her best.  Unfortunately, it didn't save this cockle-doodle-doo of a picture.  And Holly from Cool World was inspired enough to sing the title song?  Please!",1075593600,5,3628,4.836304700162074
470556,4,6302484413,"This is a wonderful movie.  Reading the reviews, I saw so many put-downs of Yves Montand and I totally disagree.  He was a wonderful actor, world-renowned and carries this movie totally.  Just because many Americans don't ""get it"" when it comes to the French does not make him any less talented.  This was his movie...HE was the main character, while Marilyn's character is more distant and viewed primarily through Yves' eyes.
Marilyn does the best she can with some obvious weight and other issues and the fact that she performed so well even with these problems made me respect her all the more.  The flaws in her appearance (like a minor scratch on a diamond)actually gave the film more credibility and made it plausible that a man who had had his fill of perfect plastic beauties would fall in love with her! I do agree she was somewhat distant, but some of that had to do with the script.  I think it is hard for some people to accept her in a supporting role at that point in her career and see a Frenchman with the lead.
Frankie Vaughn was stunning and ready for Broadway in his Tony Danton role and I do wish they had developed him a little better (there was no dialogue between his character and Montand's which was strange).  If you can put any cultural biases aside you are in for a real treat!  I do not give it a full five stars due to the technical problems with the film print but it is a jewel.",1069804800,13,1411,4.379310344827586

470558,1,6302484413,"I am only reviewing this film as a sort of amendment to my review of ""The Prince And The Showgirl"". Having said I consider that film M.M's least interesting role, I now stand self- corrected. This film, ""Let's Make Love"", is truly Marilyns least interesting role, so much so, that I conveniently erased it from my memory. It is not only her lousiest movie, but an  all-around turkey, with an awful script, that even an Arthur Miller re-write couldn't help....an un-intelligible Yves Montand doing impressions of a walrus, and is filmed through some sort of lens that makes  Marilyn look like Doris Day on quaaludes. This film was a necessity under her old Fox contract, and she hated the non-role from the get-go. In viewing her annotated scripts for this film, they have the fewest ""notes"" to herself, than any of her other scripts, which can all be viewed in Christies auction catalog. She simply had no part to work with. Every star has at least several films they've made that they wished they hadn't done, and I'm sure this was one of M.M.'s. Yes, there was all the behind-the-scenes drama on this film, the troubled M.M.-Miller marriage, the M.M.- Montand affair...if they apparently had chemistry off screen, they didn't save any for this film. All the big name cameos, Gene Kelly, Milton Berle, ...look embarressed. And even George Cukor's directing skills couldn't make this spruce goose fly. Some people can overlook a bad film just because of a stars presence, with M.M.'s fans being among the most loyal. But, though I consider myself one of her biggest admirers, I feel her unique talent and image should be seen, if not at her best, than at least in a role of SOME interest. This film does not even have the basic redeeming quality which almost all of her films possess, a magical M.M. screen image. She looks wan, woeful, and bored. Having viewed this just once, it went in the never-to-be-watched-again- file, with ""Billy Jack"", and ""Can't Stop The Music"".  A  S.T.I.N.K.E.R.... to be avoided.",1027555200,14,2009,4.814492753623188
470559,2,6302484413,"I found it quite difficult to sit through this movie. Marilyn looks great & sings wonderful, the musical numbers are good, but the script is so thin that the film as a whole is just boring, boring, boring...
The supporting cast has nearly nothing to do, and Yves Montand has to be one of the worst actors ever! His accent is simply unbearable (he even has a few lines in German & Italian, which are nearly incomprehensible to native speakers), and he never manages to give his character any credible feelings whatsoever. Why should Marilyn's character abandon Frankie Vaughan (who is rather handsome & a good singer, too) for this horrible old guy? Perhaps she really only wants his money after all...",1024963200,3,701,4.754098360655738
470560,3,6302484413,"I am a great admirer of Marilyn, and while I did buy this movie, and I watch it a few times a year, it still isn't one of my favorites.  I gave the film the 3 stars for MM!  Marilyn is fine her performance, but it's no Cheree' from Bus Stop.  This film reverts back to her older films, cutesy musical movies with cheesy plots. I thought that Gentlemen prefer Blondes was a much better musical and a better movie. Let's make Love is lacking..I found Yves Montand to be so boring and a bad actor!!! He just didn't go well with Marilyn at all.  It amazes me that she had an affair with him; I think maybe the fact that he bares a slight resemblence to Joe Dimaggio may have something to do with that.  And the fact that she was very depressed and estranged from her husband at the time, Arthur Miller probably didn't help either. The movie does offer some entertaining musical numbers, but the first half hour of it is SO BORING!!!!! I fast forward through it now.  The scenes with Marilyn are the best.  Also the cameos of Gene Kelley, Milton Berle, and Bing Crosby help to make this film a little more watchable.  The script is awful! Aside from Yves' wooden performance, the rest of the acting is fine.  I always find Tony Randall so amusing in his earlier films.  I'd have to say the first scene with Marilyn, when she performs ""My heart belongs to Daddy"" makes the film worth purchasing for one's Marilyn collection.  I think you can only truly appreciate this film if you are a big admirer of her's. The movie itself is a big flop, and from what I've read Marilyn thought so, too.  She seems very distant and has very low self esteem through out the movie.(well, except in her first scene). If you want a great movie musical, this is going to sorely disappoint.",992044800,7,1764,4.36085626911315
470561,4,6302484413,"Let's face it, Marilyn is not known for 'deep' movies, unfortunately. 'Let's Make Love' is a light musical comedy with a familiar plot. A multi-billionaire can have buy whatever he wants, but when he sees Marilyn and finds his money useless............
The two and a half years that Marilyn lived in the 1960's were not espescially good for her. In this movie she is 'plump', moreso than she was in 'Some like it Hot'. But she's still the most beautiful woman that ever lived. The songs are good, 'Specialization' and 'Let's make Love' are memorable. But the movie's jewel is 'My Heart Belongs to Daddy'. Your first sight of marilyn in this flick are her black stocking legs as she slides down a brass pole. I get light headed everytime she turns intentionally toward the camera and blows the viewer a kiss. Marilyn will live in her fan's hearts forever.
Yves Montand did an excellent job as a stiff, upper crust rich man who hires Milton Berle, Gene Kelly, and Bing Crosby to help him get a small bit in Marilyn's off-broadway show.",991267200,,1033,4.6502732240437155

470563,3,6302484413,"that Universal had let Rock Hudson make this movie with Marilyn as he so badly wanted to!  One thing for sure, there would have been no extramarital affair, as reported, but the chemistry would have been most interesting  based on his performances with Doris Day.  As one movie critic noted, there  was too much sexual tension between the stars, and that would have been  fine in a more serious movie.  Still, it's always nice to see Marilyn.  And  for the reviewer who said she didn't look her best, check her out in the  corset-type showgirl costume in the Milton Berle scene, and the  almost-off-the-body dress in the Chinese restaurant where Montand's  character declares his love for her.  I know Marilyn is still popular, but  when will we get to see her many widescreen movies, such as LET'S MAKE  LOVE, amongst others in a letterbox format with decent sound.

7826305,4,6302484413,"I am perhaps a bit generous, but I assume that anbody who is curious about this movie is interested in Marilyn Monroe. And she's in it. And rather scantily clad, for quite a bit of it. The first musical number might even be called a bit skeevy, it's a striptease number, including stripper poles, actually. But now I'm totally exaggerating, don't worry.. Also, for this first number at least, Marilyn Monroe might be a bit on the heavy side (for her), but hey I'm just sayin'. That can work. Now as to the plot of the movie, I though it was astonishingly slight and silly. The cameos from Bing Crosby and Milton Berle and Gene Kelly are rather desperately lazy. Of course, Yves Montand plays one of the world's most elegible bachelors, powerful, rich. And Monroe's character all but ignores his romantic advances. To bother more than this with describing the plot would be misleading, if it gave the impression that the movie bothers with the plot. It's sort of a money can't buy you love thing. An utter piffle of a light-hearted screwball comedy romance. And Yves Montand's French accent is so thick he seems to be utterly stressed with the task of trying to spit out his lines. About this, I do not exaggerate. I simply feel terrible for him. He doesn't, indeed, sound coherent. There is a mime routine that he does at one point, that is presented in the movie like it's supposed to be great, and people love it. I didn't even get that part, though of course it was a relief that he didn't have to talk. Maybe that's why people applauded. Really, I think the movie is irritating and aimless. Now that I think about it, we have the Yves Montand character who is a wealthy womanizer, famed for his wheeling and dealing with bimbos. Nevermind, I think it's a mistake to be thinking abou it. Bugger problem anyways, that Montand barely spoke English. Of course, also there is  Frankie Vaughn, who I guess was a pretty successful lounge  singer. But if you come to this as a Marilyn Monroe fan, there is no getting around the fact that it is essential. Only slightly charming at best, but it's Marilyn Monroe.",1512950400,,2107,4.571428571428571

Tony Randall does a good job right until he tells his boss off; thereafter, he stands around in the background like a coat rack.  What a waste of his talents.
