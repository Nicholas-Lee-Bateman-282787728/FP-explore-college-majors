The templars are somewhat effective, the slow motion horse riding is atmospheric, and the setting is creepy.  It doesn't get going though.  There are also a few subplot things that don't make any sense.  For example the girl murdered by the templars arises from the dead as zombie and eventually gets set afire.  There is no explanation for this; I wanted to know how it fit into the story.  There are other problems also.  Watch your copy of ""Night of the Living Dead"" again before settling into this languid psuedo-zombie flick.",1031011200,2,697,4.647540983606557

I can recommend this movie, even though some scenes are so dull (Knowing a girl was sacrificed there, 4 people spend the night at the monastery)and the templars are so slow ( yet they get everyone they want), because it got atmosphere and the rare templar scenes are somewhat frightening.

856120,5,6304361025,"""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" was such a success that it spawned three sequels, and it's easy to see why. The film concerns the haunting of a mysterious ruin by long-dead zombies, and the fates of a group of  holidaymakers who encounter them. Many suspenseful scenes occur featuring  the undead creatures, which are frightening enough as they emerge from  tombs, and creep slowly towards their victims, but worse still, they soon  jump onto zombie horses and gallop en masse through the night! Filmed in  slow motion, these scenes are almost poetically eerie. One great moment  involves a surrounded victim who has realised that the zombies are  completely blind, and holds her breath in terror, only for the zombies to  listen in on the sound of her frantically beating heart! The film is  slightly let down by a spurious lesbian flashback, and the rape of the main  heroine by a macho scumbag who is supposed to be helping her, but overall,  the nightmarish atmosphere has been seldom bettered in zombie films, and  the unique creations of the unead Knights Templar make this a truly  original and scary film. Watch it and enjoy!",958953600,15,1127,4.837696335078534

856468,5,6304361025,"This Spanish horror film combines excellent locations, nice atmosphere, suspense and gore to deliver a great midnight type movie. It's a little slow in parts because the purpose of the film isn't to simply to deliver gore and violence. The beginning portions of the film have a girl traveling and then jumping from a moving train into the desolate countryside; the driver of the train says he never stops at this one location.  She travels through a field and spends the night in the abandoned stone monastery of the Templars, which causes them to slowly rise at night. These sequences when she is traveling on the train and then walking through the abandoned countryside to spend the night in the monastery to awake the Templars may be considered somewhat slow to some mainstream horror fans. This isn't a film that shows the zombies running amok throughout the entire movie; their screen time is limited to certain parts. It isn't meant to be non-stop carnage and gore, even though it delivers some gruesome scenes. There's a lot of emphasis filming the excellent countryside locations, developing atmosphere and suspense, and character development is also present. As for the nudity, there's some topless nudity and a slight bit of rear nudity. Just like all the blind dead films, I thought the music is really good. The movie may be considered somewhat scary to some people, even though there isn't any jump scares. If you want the fastest-paced blind dead film with the most violence, gore and action then get the RETURN OF THE EVIL DEAD sequel.

The DVD quality is excellent. The best version by far on the disc is the original uncut Spanish version with English subtitles. The extra showing the alternate title while hearing a narrator is called REVENGE OF THE PLANET OF APE. This makes no sense and is kind of funny because they wanted to get fans of the other film to see this movie by trying to trick people that both films are related.",1389657600,2,1946,4.788690476190476

The atmosphere, mixed with the suspenseful and genuinely scary scenes make it very unique. Its a great film to watch on a dark night with the lights shut off.

The Templar Zombies are awesome for the time, creepy, slow moving and very deliberate, however, a big flaw is the horses they ride, the horse is covered with a creepy tarp and that is all, no attempt was made to make the horses look more zombie/creepy like.  The acting will not win any awards, but they do keep you entertained, especially in the original Spanish version.  The setting of the ruins is a great locale to film the movie, it gives an auora of inpending doom.  The transfer to DVD is not re-mastered and you will see the imperfections of the film, but does not distract from the action.  All in All a good movie, but not one that will scare your socks off.",1293926400,,961,4.401129943502825
856474,3,6304361025,"""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" aka ""Night of the Blind Terror"" is a lengthy uneven mix of European exploitation and well executed gothic horror.  Despite riffing on Hitchock's amatuer detective formula, the script boils down to attractive women and sleezy men doing stupid things and getting killed.  The film's modest attempts at character development look and feel like a campy 70s Soap Opera, especially the patience testing first act.  And while director Amando de Ossorio may let the slow parts drag and drag, the film's three major horror sequences are masterfully staged.

Anton Garcia Abril's unsettling score of monk chants sets the mood effectively while the authentic runied castle the movie revolves around is a geniuenly creepy location. Draped in heavy cloaks and always silent, the skeletal Templar Knights are truly frightening as they relentlessly stalk their victims through claustophobic ruins or chase them through the countryside on horseback in slow motion. Ossorio keeps the gore limited to modest blood letting but curiously doesn't shun away from erotic violence and rape. With such a strange combination of atmosphere and exploitation there is definetly something for everyone, however,it may also leave viewers conflicted.

856557,3,6304361025,"`Tombs of the Blind Dead', released in '71 was the first of writer/director Amando de Ossorio's four cult films affectionately known by its fans as `the Blind Dead'. Who will ever forget that deep, unnerving chant-like moan resonating within the ancient castle walls that precedes the appearance a the long dead group of notorious 13th century Templar Knights.

Yes the production values are poor, the special effects weak and the dialogue bordering on laughable. Yet with all the negatives there is still something inordinately eerie that takes place when that moaning sound begins and the slow-motion, dirt incrusted corpses appear. It definitely creates an atmosphere not soon forgotten.

856559,2,6304361025,"This movie is hilarious. I wasn't sure to rate it 10 or 1.
The beginning Intro to the ""mysterious knights templar"" is nothing less than retarded.

It starts off so quickly with the main characters meeting at some resort in Lisbon and you get the feeling that just maybe something could happen.
Theres an allusion to a lesbian affair with the two main female characters and some heavy flirting from the male lead with one of them but the only things without clothes in this one is a bunch of mannequins.

The acting is atrocious and the story seems like it was written by a nerdy  metalhead in high school who's played too much dungeons and dragons.

Why would the girl in the beginning just jump off the train alone in the middle of nowhere, walk up to the ruins of some monastery roll out her sleeping bag and tune in jazz on her transistor radio? Well of course the silly zombies kill the camper and she soon turns into a zombie.
One of the funniest scenes is when she gets ""killed"" by the timid gal in the mannequin factory. She manages to set her on fire The burning effect is a thing to contemplate. (I read that the director objected to the undead templars being refered to as zombies because that meant they were just mindless creatures. Like it matters!)

Another good one is the scene in the morgue where that strange guy with the frog pulls the sheet from the corpse and there's some old lady there instead of the couple's friend. I'm wondering if that was an attempt at comic relief but I really just think it was the director's idiotic idea of a fright.

So the moral of the review is this...
If you still think that old satanic cults coming back to life to suck the blood of their victims is scary and intriguing, then check this out. Alternately...if you're a seasoned horror fan who enjoys all the ""facets"" of the genre, then check this out.",1189900800,,1856,4.428152492668621
856560,3,6304361025,"In 1971 Eurohorror auteur Amando di Ossario gave the horror world one of its most stunning creations, the faceless zombie Knight's Templars who hunted by sound alone. All in all, the film is much better than I imagined it would be. The Knights have a truly unique look (that would be replicated by Peter Jackson 30 years later for the Lord of the Rings trilogy).

The plot is a little lacking. After her boyfriend shows interest in another woman on a train in the Spanish countryside, Virginia jumps off a moving train and winds up at the Berzano Monastary home of the Templar Knights. There she is hunted and killed. After some exposition her friends learn the horrible secret of the Templars.

There is not much more to the story than this but the special effects of the Knights on their horses in slow motion is worth the price of admission. I saw the original Spanish print which clocks in at 97 minutes. The Blue Undeground disc also includes the truncated English version and a trailer.

In Ossorio's nightmare vision, a legion of Knights Templar - executed horsemen whose eyes had been pecked out by crows - rise rotting from their graves, hunting only by sound in a quest for human flesh. The BLIND DEAD saga begins here, as a modern-day tourist trip to the ruins of the Templar monastery unleashes a frenzy of lesbian desire, sexual violence and the unholy onslaught of the eyeless undead!

856563,4,6304361025,"""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" (""La Noche del terror ciego"") is the first of the four films by writer-director Amando de Ossorio dealing with the Templar Knights that rise from the dead and creep, very slowly, after their victims. Five hundred years ago the Templars were sacrificing virgins and drinking their blood. Eventually the locals attacked the Templars, burning out the eyes of the knights before burning them at the stake. Ever since then no one goes near their castle, that is until Virginia White (Mara Elena Arpn) hops off a train in the middle of nowhere and ends up spending the night there. That night the Templar knights, skeletal corpses dressed up in armor, rise (slowly) from their tombs and follow the sounds of Virginia's screams. The trick is to stay silent so the blind Templars cannot hear where you are, but it is difficult to stay quiet when these things are after you.

When Virginia's dead body is found her friends Betty Turner (Lone Fleming) and Roger Whelan (Csar Burner) decide to find out what happened to her. This is where they learn the legend of the Templars and then go off to investigate the castle, thinking that maybe somebody is using the local tale as a cover for criminal activity. This explains why they drag along local smuggler Pedro Candal (Joseph Thelman) and his girlfriend Maria (Mara Silva), to investigate the place, which only gives the Templars more victims to pursue (slowly). In his horror films Ossorio is all about atmosphere, so what stands out here is the thought of these shuffling corpses coming after you while the young women who are about to die take terms trying not to make a sound and then screaming all the way until the end. There is usually some blood at the end, but ""Tombs of the Blind Dead"" is more about spooky atmosphere. You just have to remind yourself that this film was made in 1971 and not judge its slower pace (and the slowest monsters you have ever seen) by the standard of contemporary horror films.

Actually, this is the 86 minute dubbed into English version of the original 101 minute Spanish film. What has been cut from ""La Noche del terror ciego"" is the nudity, a rather chaste lesbian love scene, the bloodier parts of the flashback to the Templar rituals, and one of the more gratuitous rape scenes of all-time (although the part where the rapist offers his victim a cigarette afterwards before he is killed by the Templars remains for you to scratch your head over). The edited flashback is actually the prologue for ""Tombs of the Blind Dead."" Obviously if you can track down the existing Spanish version (which clocks in at 97 minutes for some reason) you can see the film Ossorio actually made and not this edited down version, paying the small price of reading subtitles to enjoy the film.

This film was followed by ""El ataque de los muertos sin ojos"" (""Return of hte Blind Dead"") in 1973, ""El buque maldito"" (""The Ghost Galleon"") in 1974, and ""La Noche de las gavitos"" (""Night of the Seagulls"") in 1975. Some see Jesus Franco's 1985 film ""La Mansin de los muertos vivientes"" as a remake of Ossorio's first film, but I think you are on safer ground if you consider it to be definitely inspired by this entire series. One of the interesting things about the series is that most of the films can stand on their own, with the second being the best of the lot.",1132963200,3,3351,4.638047138047138
856564,3,6304361025,"As alluded to by a previous reviewer, this movie was indeed featured on Elvira's Movie Macabre back in the day.  That should be all you need to know to understand how cheese-y the movie is (for you younger folks, this is the kind of movie you'd see lambasted on Mystery Science Theater 3000).  Of course, it's tasty cheese and it has aged rather well.

The movie hinges on the Knights Templar, who were actual, historical figures & the original proponents of the (European) War on Terror.  Though they lost many battles throughout the Crusades, the Templars became so wealthy & consequently so powerful that they began to challenge the rule & authority of European monarchs.  The monarchs eventually conspired against the Templars, charging them with heresy.  Templar leaders were prosecuted & subsequently executed, causing the organization's dissolution.  Though the heresy charges were largely false concoctions, the sordid allegations make for a much more interesting premise on which to build a horror movie.

To his credit, de Ossorio's decision to exploit the more diabolical aspects of Templar mythology pays off.  The overall concept is brilliant, though it just begs to be remade with more money and better effects. The coolest, most unique features of TOTBD are the genuine, on-location castle ruins & the eerily undead Templars riding horseback in slo-mo. Conversely, it's most annoying & inexplicable how apparently in Spain day turns to night in a matter of about fifteen seconds and yet the dead of night looks just like noon! Watch it; you'll understand what I mean.

The movie has creep factor galore (one creep in particular being a leacherous, necrophile mortician's assistant), but few genuine scares. It's also subtitled, as I recall, so be warned.

856566,3,6304361025,"Tombs of the Blind Dead (Amando de Ossorio, 1971)
One of the often overlooked Euroshock films of the seventies, Tombs of the Blind Dead has been finding itself a new generation of fans thanks to a DVD release and a mention in Fangoria's 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen. While I wouldn't go quite that far, it's got a charming naivete to it, some excellent footage, and a bushel or two of good mindless fun.
Virginia (Maria Arpon) meets her old babysitter Beth (Lone Fleming) by chance one day, and Beth ends up invited on a weekend with Virginia and her boyfriend Roger (David Hasselhoff lookalike Cesar Burner). After some sexual tension on the train, Virginia runs off to an abandoned monastery around which local legends circulate about a band of Knights Templar who survive in undead form. She turns up dead the next day, and Roger and Beth decide to investigate...
The one thing about this movie every review mentions, and rightly, is the slow-motion shots of the templars riding their undead horses. Beautiful stuff (and, as far as I know, unduplicated to this day). Sure, the slow-motion looks a little cheesy these days, but hey, the movie's almost thirty-five years old. Psychomania's cheesy, too, but it's still brilliant.
The one thing they all seem to gloss over is the painfully large plot holes, threads that go nowhere, somewhat substandard acting by a select few characters, and incredibly cheesy special effects (the fire scene's effects are only a step above those of a similar scene in the shoestring-budgeted TV series Night Gallery). Still, there's enough good stuff in here to make it worth a rental, and the ending (the style of which was borrowed from a certain similar horror film released a few years earlier) is un-Hollywood enough to be refreshing to even the most jaded horror film fan. Turn your brain off for a hundred minutes and just enjoy the undead Templars riding their undead horses in slow motion. ** ",1085356800,3,1948,4.84984984984985

7869338,3,6304361025,"Lots of pointless romance filler (or rather just relationships that lead to pointless sex) and very little Templar zombies. Basic plot is that a very up-with-the-fashion-of-the-times European guy wants to do both his female friends. One gets upset about this and leaps off a train in the countryside to run away from this awkward situation and ends being eaten alive by Templar zombies for refusing to conform to the wishes of these horrible people (at least, that's the only explanation I can think of why the story-tellers felt she needed to die).

Her friends get worried after they lose contact with her and try to find out what happened. Their investigation leads them to a professor who has a career-criminal son, a mortician or something who mixes up corpses to prank people, and a trip back to the original medieval city where their friend died. Well, they die, too, except for the one female friend. She lives and escapes to a train.

This is the cool part of the movie because the Templar zombies board the train in pursuit of her and start eating people.

In fact, this should have been the middle of the movie and instead it's the end. Because everything in between is the height-of-fashion European guy walking around Portugal and his girlfriend following wherever he goes. If you had cut out all the walking, had the Templar Zombies invade a town trying to hunt the one woman who got away, then this film could have been pretty good. But bad editing and not dealing with plot issues make this a minor film. The idea is phenomenal, brilliant even, but the end result is a solid ""meh.""",1508716800,,1597,4.696428571428571
7869339,2,6304361025,"Heads Up Fellow Primers: This is the severely cut & restructured English language home video release from the 80s remastered for online streaming. Only useful purpose I can see is to get people intrigued enough to try the widescreen version by Blue Underground showing the uncut Spanish print which runs about 15 minutes longer. Look for the one that actually has artwork on the cover, should have suspected this was the case, and indeed it's even more severely cut (down to PG, which may actually have been the original English theatrical form) than the VHS version. Disappointing too because it looks pretty good for the English edit, which I only know from old VHS tapes: Only the Spanish version has been released on an authorized DVD. So sure, start with this perhaps but you are seeing a version missing the parts which made the Blind Dead series endure.",1501027200,3,860,4.8175675675675675

I'm not saying that added nudity, lesbianism and rape (you can figure out when they all happen) are essential to a film, but when I watch something I want to see the real version, not what American censors at the time thought I should see.  Don't wanna read a censored book, don't wanna watch a censored film.  Especially when compared to the content of most of the modern horror schlock out there, getting the censored version of this movie seems like short change.

As for the content of the film: If you want to watch gratuitously bloody dismemberment, avoid.  If you want to jump out of your chair and giggle at stupid jump scares, avoid.  If you like dreamy, gothic, impressionistic 70's horror, watch now.",1476230400,2,780,4.568345323741007
