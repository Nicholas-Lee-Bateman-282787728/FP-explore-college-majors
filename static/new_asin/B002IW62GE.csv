8371290,5,B002IW62GE,I am a big fan of the work they are doing at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary and the message they are spreading around the country.  So loved the stories included in these Dogtown episodes.  Wish they were making more!,1461456000,,216,4.512820512820513
8371291,5,B002IW62GE,I loved this DVD set about Dogtown - a real dog sanctuary for dogs that have problems. The DVDs show how the people there work with the dogs to get them adoptable to families,1440374400,,174,4.147058823529412
8371292,5,B002IW62GE,"This DVD is the last one my wife needed to complete her DogTown collection.  It features some truly heartwarming stories about dogs that would have been euthanized were it not for Best Friends.  Most of the dogs in this collection were adopted to loving families.

My wife and I spent our fifth wedding anniversary volunteering for Best Friends Animal Society (the sanctuary of which Dog Town is a part) after seeing this show on Netflix.  It really is a wonderful place with some amazing people.  This show highlights just some of the wonderful things they do there.",1429920000,,567,4.804123711340206

Unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dogtown-Second-Chances/dp/B0016OM3X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dogtown: Second Chances</a>, this one has subtitles, and they're done very well. A tiny bit of information is missing, but it's not enough to matter, nor in terribly significant places. 5 stars for the show, 4 stars for the subtitles, and 5 stars for the extra stuff! Extra stuff includes an episode of another (unnamed) show about search and rescue dogs, a mini about a new run for Archie and Electra, and several previews of other National Geographic shows.

EXTREMELY highly recommended! Personally, I'd really enjoy a special event or some extra stuff about the cat side of Best Friends!!",1309824000,3,1254,7.701388888888889
