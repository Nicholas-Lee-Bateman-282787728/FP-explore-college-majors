4593268,2,B0056ZRP02,"WeTV only chose five weddings out of TWO seasons to feature on this DVD?  No.  True fans of David Tutera want to see ALL the weddings from ALL the seasons, not just a select few.  Maybe we enjoyed the ones left out better than the ones included.  Give me the entire season -- of all seasons -- and THEN I'll consider buying them on DVD.",1329004800,16,336,4.123076923076923

It's too bad there aren't more dvd's to gat a set.  Now they all have to purchased by the episode like other movies and sitcoms.  I don't think I will ever get enough of David Tutera.  Love him to pieces.  Very easy on the eyes to.",1394755200,2,361,4.014084507042254
