2596364,2,B000G0O5FK,"Denise, why don't you turn up your mike instead.  She is very energetic and upbeat but yells the cues the whole time.  It was really irritating.

I also didn't like the set too much - was really flashy, literally.  Not recommended for anyone who has problems with flashing lights, etc.  The walking segment wasn't really walking, it was just another lower impact routine, so that was a disappointment.  In the same section there is one song with hardly any beat to move to so it is very awkward.  I didn't care for the resistance band section because each segment was too short and didn't really jive well with the lower impact it was combined with.  At $17.99 I really didn't feel it was worth the money at all.",1170028800,8,712,4.5078125

In addition to the uplifting praise music, it moves quickly, and Donna Richardson is one of the best at keeping you apprised of changes that are coming in the routine, so you're not struggling to keep up, or falling behind.  I love that I can do four things at once with this workout:  praise God, get in a cardio workout, some strength training, and keep my ""temple"" in good shape!  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I would've liked to have had a little more strength training in between the cardio segments.  But I still highly recommend this dvd; even beginners should have no trouble with it.",1371427200,5,653,4.453781512605042

2596455,1,B000G0O5FK,I was very disappointed in the quality of the video. Not what I expected or wanted in a Christian exercise video. Could not hear the music for her loud and over the top voice instructions.,1352073600,4,188,4.4

2596470,5,B000G0O5FK,I like this excercise video because the line dancing is easy to perform.  Also she goes through the movements slow about three times before she starts the full out exercise with music and other participants.  Also the people in the video look like everyday people which makes it more real and understanding the different levels you can workout.,1328486400,,344,4.913793103448276

2596475,3,B000G0O5FK,"Welldone video for the most part although the music and exercise sequences occasioanlly seemed a bit out of sync. very upbeat, pleasant gentle workout that would be best duited for the beginning exerciser",1324339200,,204,5.212121212121212
2596476,4,B000G0O5FK,"It's pretty much a dance workout. You do the electric slide and other dances, but it's really creative too. The only thing I wasn't too keen on was that you don't have the option to watch the DVD all the way through. It's split up into sections. So, you have to stop after each section and hit play again. For example, the warmup is one section. The aerobic workout is another section. The cool down is another. This disrupted my workout a bit in all honesty. Plus, you will need a ""workout belt"" or something for some of the moves. I didn't have one, so I just used my weights. Made it a better workout anyway. Overall though, it's a great time. She's got lots of energy and super encouraging. She also quotes Scriptures all through the workout. Oh, one more down side though: the cool down could really use a lot of work. I honestly think that if you get this DVD, you should do your own cool down and stretch or do another DVD that has a good one. This DVD does not. Still, a great production though. Enjoy! :)",1323734400,5,1013,4.28125

2596478,5,B000G0O5FK,"SIMPLY PUT.....LUUUUUV IT
I am not an aerobics kind of person, because of my previous spinal surgery. But I took my time, and did not over rotate, my upper, nor lower half during the routines. I will say I forgot I was doing aerobics after about 2 minutes. I kept going, and going, and going. What a joyous, and upbeat workout. The place where the DVD was recorded was awesome. The atmosphere was like a party with the huge screen displaying the light show; behind the live band, and singers. I have begun to experience working out in a different way.

I am a runner, however, since doing the line dancing, and aerobics, I get my heart rate up faster, and do less pounding my knees. This definitely will continue to be a large add on to my workouts.

Love you Donna!!!

UPDATE:9/4/2011....I have lost a bunch of inches; thus far. I don't bother to weigh, because I have lots of muscle anyhow. So inches count for me. The choice of workouts within the same dvd makes it so much easier to click, and move on to what you want; without having to stop, and put in another dvd to change your preference. You get 2 10 minute ""walking in the spirit"" workouts, which are energetic low impact, but effective. 2 10 minute line dancing programs, that get you sweating before you know it. Aerobics, and muscle conditioning programs, with resistance bands. Stretching program...All are FUN FUN FUN!!

Another update: 10/15/2011...After spinal surgery I was not able to rigorously run as prior; and I gained a few pounds. When I started this program I was wearing a 1x/16 in womens. Now I can wear missy xl; which is a 14. That's only working out lightly, @ least a minimum of 10 minutes a day; and sometimes skipping a few days. Most people plateu due to the issue of going full steam ahead in the beginning; if you start out at full intense, your body has no where to climb. Do ya get what I am saying? Keep your workouts steady, and consistant; with a few routine changes; then you will be able to maintain your work outs over the duration. And you will continue to loose the weight. Always remember to consume plenty of water daily. Some people may find it hard to do, but when you start it, you'll feel the difference in your body, your skin, and energy level. Lay off the carbonated sodas.",1313971200,12,2280,4.4735576923076925

Donna Richardson has a knack for encouraging you to do well at your level, and to push yourself just enough.  I also love working out to Christian music, so when it circles back through my head later in the day, it's good, uplifting lyrics that I'm meditating on.",1301097600,,419,4.346153846153846

Great workout for beginners. It can also be easily modified for those who prefer low-impact workout.",1294790400,,405,4.771428571428571

For a large part of the workout it seems she is yelling to be heard over the music, which I found to be too distracting. In the Body Gospel series, one of the workouts is ""live"" and she does not yell. Donna does have a wonderful, uplifting personality; I just didn't like this particular workout.",1278720000,12,455,4.241379310344827
2596499,5,B000G0O5FK,"I am a very lazy person and Donna Richardson Joyner's videos are the only ones I do not mind doing.  This is because she has really good music that keeps you motivated. No cheesy muzak -- but good gospel music with guest artistes performing that you do not mind hearing over and over. Also, she mixes up the moves so you never repeat them and get bored. I could imagine an experienced exerciser finding it too easy but it is just right for me.  My only complaint is that sometimes it is hard to hear her voice above the music but since the moves are easy to follow, it is not much of a problem.  I also like that she has different body types performing her video -- not just the skinny and fit.",1271548800,6,694,4.164179104477612
2596500,2,B000G0O5FK,"I wanted to like this exercise dvd, but I can't honestly recommend it. You may think I'm just being picky, but the set design left a lot to be desired. Most exercise videos take place either in a space that looks like an aerobics classroom at a gym or on location somewhere at the beach. This set was just a large black studio. It sounds like a random thing to critique, but it took away from my ability to enjoy the video, partly because it made it seem just thrown together. I also don't think that the live music worked well with an exercise video, as the singers are distracting. The sound quality is also not that great. Overall I think the idea of Christian work out videos is a good one, but this one just wasn't made very well, and the routines themselves were a little too low impact for me. And that's coming from someone who never exercises, and was looking for a fun way to stay active.",1259107200,6,898,4.288235294117647
2596501,5,B000G0O5FK,This DVD is just right for me. I get the workout I need this time of my life --- its not too easy and definitely makes me SWEAT.,1256515200,,128,3.607142857142857
2596502,1,B000G0O5FK,I've discovered after purchasing another Donna Richardson workout video that I am not a true fan of Ms. Richardson.  I think my problem with her is she doesn't do a good job at demonstrating moves before transitioning to something different.  I think I'll stick with my all time favorites:  Turbo Jam and TaeBo Amped!,1238112000,4,317,4.833333333333333
2596503,5,B000G0O5FK,"Really fast paced.  I would suggest viewing all the way through first.  Not enough demostration of exercises, but effective once you get the hang of it.",1236902400,2,152,4.8076923076923075
2596504,5,B000G0O5FK,"This DVD is fabulous. I wanted a way to workout that was fun, not boring, have Christian music and this is it. I had to replay the sessions to learn the steps to the exercises (dances), but I wanted to learn the line dances anyway and what a great way to do it with Christian music. Thanks Mrs. Joyner.",1236384000,,302,4.135593220338983
2596505,5,B000G0O5FK,I thought this was an awesome DVD. It was fun and energetic. It is noce to work out with gospel music.,1224892800,,102,3.9047619047619047
2596506,4,B000G0O5FK,"This DVD was the motivation that I needed to get started with my exercise program.  I love the music and Donna's presentation of the various exercises and dances. If you want to get in shape while praising the Lord, I highly recommend this DVD.",1224374400,2,244,4.545454545454546
2596507,5,B000G0O5FK,"I absolutely love this video and the workout is very effective. The next day I knew that I had worked out, but I wasn't sore and tired. I felt energized. You also get the privilege of focusing on worship to the Almighty God while you workout. You get a short visit from some incredible singers and worship leaders. I also would say that after changing my eating habits just a little like cutting out sweets and then doing this video for 4 of the 7 days, i lost about 3 pounds. It is a very effective workout.",1223856000,2,508,4.247422680412371
2596518,4,B000G0O5FK,"This is a great exercise routine. I've worked out to Donna's programs in the past and as always she gives great instruction.  What I love about the program is that it is easy to follow and I really feel like I worked out when I'm done. I feel like I've worked muscles that haven't been worked out in a while. The 20 minute and 30 minute work outs are great.  I didn't care for 10 minute line dance program, but I think that if you enjoy line dancing you won't have a problem with it. It's worth buying and it's really different as it has you working out to glorify God and working out to Christian music is a nice change too. Go for it you won't be dissappointed.",1223510400,2,663,4.131782945736434
2596519,4,B000G0O5FK,This is a very appropriate title for this dvd.  You will definitely sweat.  Great songs and Donna makes you want to keep moving.  I love it.,1216598400,3,140,4.3076923076923075
2596520,3,B000G0O5FK,"I didn't enjoy it as much as the first one. The dark, disco-like setting just didn't work for me - too distracting. The DVD is also not user friendly, the first one was much easier to customize excatly what sessions you wanted without having to keep going back or repeatedly picking segments.",1210032000,3,292,4.634615384615385
2596521,5,B000G0O5FK,"I loved this workout because of the uplifting music.  My two daughters ages 2 and 8 love ""Sweating in the Spirit"" as well. It is a great workout for the whole family.  The dance moves are fun and make you want to get up and move!",1207872000,3,229,3.9565217391304346
2596522,5,B000G0O5FK,This is an excellent video.  I sweat everytime I do the 30 minute workout.  If you love gospel music and want to get in shape.  This is the video for you.  I love it.  The music is good and the workout routine makes you sweat.  Along with eating right and exercising nightly.  I've lost 5 lbs in less than two weeks.,1204070400,35,316,4.081967213114754
2596523,5,B000G0O5FK,I love the DVD.  I am able to utilize it by exercising in the comforts fo my home when I am unable to go to the gym.,1203811200,2,116,3.2962962962962963
2596524,5,B000G0O5FK,"This second exercise DVD by Donna Richardson really works you out. I love the mix of line-dancing, aerobics and working out to some of her favorite Gospel Artists. I hope she comes out with a 3rd one soon.",1191456000,2,205,4.421052631578948
2596525,5,B000G0O5FK,I have enjoyed the workout dvd. It keeps you moving with a smile on your face. I am looking forwoard to more in the future.,1175817600,4,123,3.96
2596526,4,B000G0O5FK,"This is not my favorite of the Sweating in the Spirit dvds.  But it is a good workout.  What I like is the line dancing section, especially the He Rocks line dance. I also like the Spirit Stretch.  Two things I didn't really like, were the stage atmosphere or just the working out to the band playing in some of it.  The work out was a good workout that will get you sweating.  But I prefer the Sweating in the Spirit 3 in 1 to this",1172534400,12,432,3.9767441860465116
2596527,5,B000G0O5FK,I LIKE THE MUSIC AND THE FACT SHE USES SPIRITUAL THEMES THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO. SHE MAKES SURE YOU HAVE A BALANCE OF THE SPIRIT AND EXERCISE FOR THE BODY. THE ROUTINES ARE EASY TO FOLLOW AND SHE HAS SEGMENTS FOR EVERY LEVEL OF FITNESS. I THINK THE SETUP LOOKS GOOD TOO.,1171411200,29,267,4.254901960784314

8128161,4,B000G0O5FK,"This is a good DVD for beginners-intermediate level folks!

Pros:
-The DVD is divided up nicely into warm ups, low impact workout (""Walking in the Spirit"" 20 mins) Higher Impact (""Sweating in the Spirit"" 30 mins) and cool down (""Spirit Stretch"") As well as a chapter where you can pre-learn the moves.
-The moves are simple enough that you can pick them up without watching the ""learn the moves"" chapter, but it's nice they included that section as well.
-It has a decent cross section of builds, body types, ethnicities and genders represented. (Not as good as the first ""Sweating in the Spirit"" DVD, however, but its always nice to see that representation, out there!)
-This is a fun workout for families!
-Really good music with recognizable gospel artists! The live band was nice but not not necessary.

Cons:
-Unlike the first ""Sweating in the Spirit"", This workout includes the use of resistance bands, which I found annoying. Not needing special equipment to do a workout is great; and switching back and forth between using bands and dong the workout is awkward and irritating.

Overall this is a good DVD!  Well worth checking out!!",1456704000,,1141,4.865979381443299
8128162,2,B000G0O5FK,"It's ok. I just wish it was a little less cheesy and more like a real party-like atmosphere. There should have been more people, better ""bumpin'"" and lively music. I guess I was expecting it to be more of a party atmosphere than a workout. I hate working out and need it to feel more like I'm dancing than exercising...just my opinion. So, if you are like me in that regard, you may want to save your money.",1451606400,,407,4.230769230769231
8128163,3,B000G0O5FK,"I had hoped the focus would be on the worship/praise music that is very subtle in the background. The focus is on the exercise. It's ok, but I can barely get my praise on the music's so low.",1450828800,2,190,4.026315789473684
