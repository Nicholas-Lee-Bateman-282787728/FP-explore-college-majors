Even with all of our problems, the USA is still the greatest nation on earth, but you do not hear much of this anymore. America enjoys great freedom and economic prosperity, but politicians and American citizens for the most part seem to have forgotten this fact. What George H.W. Bush lacked in charisma, he made up for in sincerity and compassion. This was evident in his speeches, in which he praised the American military as the greatest military in the world. He also choked back tears at one point while talking about the greatness of the American people. He urged Americans to volunteer their time to help Americans in need. Missing from his speeches was any mention of growing government to attempt to solve all of our problems. This is a message that is desperately needed today. It is too bad that George H.W. Bush did not serve two terms as President. In addition to the speeches, you may enjoy some shots of a younger Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney, as well as younger Senators John Kerry, Ted Kennedy, and others.
