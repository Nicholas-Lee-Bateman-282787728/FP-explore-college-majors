54905,3,0783209967,"I saw Amazon Women on the Moon  when i was a teenager and finally broke down and bought the DVD when I couldn't find it streaming anywhere. As a collectors edition DVD its a little light on the bonus features. I don't think the movie really holds up entirely well and seems pretty dated. The Arsenio Hall and the Don ""No Soul"" Simmons bits are the highlights.",1461283200,,359,4.358208955223881

54911,5,0783209967,The beginning at this movie is especially funny in my opinion. It is most certainly worth viewing. It is a classic that should be watched.,1451952000,,138,4.56

54913,5,0783209967,"I love this movie, even though it is little known and likely hardly ever purchased!  ""Amazon Women On the Moon"" is only a covering title for what is really an outstanding collection of brilliantly comedic shorts strung together around an incessantly interrupted 1950s-style sci-fi movie (there are bits and pieces of ""Amazon Women On the Moon"" strewn throughout the picture).  Look for great performances from some your favorite actors who were, then, just starting out, including Arsenio Hall, Steve Gutenburg, and Rosanna Arquette.  Be sure to check out the cut scenes, and to see Carrie Fisher in the last skit!  This is certain to make you laugh!",1449532800,4,650,5.046728971962617
54914,4,0783209967,I have a weird sense of humour and this is a great movie. A number of cameos and outstanding skits. I love it. Buy it.,1448064000,,118,3.76
54945,5,0783209967,"What a great comedy movie made up of different segments. Similar to The Groove Tube and The Kentucky Fried Movie, these skits will have you laughing your rear off. Don ""No Soul Simmons"" is on of the best.",1446508800,,204,4.394736842105263

54947,5,0783209967,Hubby had VHS version and loved it.  Just did a quick search and found it in DVD.  Would say this is a guy film. Based on TV shows back in the day when the film would break and they go to commercials.  He likes the 3 stooges he would love this.,1445990400,,244,3.7450980392156863

54950,5,0783209967,"An absolute classic. I've read a lot of negative reviews for this movie but I completely disagree. If you're a fan of movies like Hollywood Shuffle or shows like In Living Color, I would highly recommend this film. It is off the wall and absolutely hilarious. It is comprised of a series of ""sketches"" with a sort of wraparound late night movie called Amazon Women on the Moon. It's worth watching just to see the dazzling array of actors including Steve Guttenberg, Arsenio Hall, Andrew Dice Clay and many MANY more. HIGHLY RECCOMEND!",1439251200,3,535,4.763440860215054

55041,5,0783209967,"I have a VHS copy that I recorded from TV long, long ago. Many of the scenes listed as deleted in the DVD were in the TV release. There's nudity that wasn't on TV (of course) and one scene from the hair looming skit that's missing entirely. All in all, this is definitely worth the price of the DVD. Sit back and watch some of the stars of TV (and movie and even radio) crank out some serious laughs. If a complete DVD is ever offered, I'll buy that too. Until then I'll laugh along with this one.",1395619200,4,497,4.081632653061225

55043,1,0783209967,I don't understand any of the positive reviews on Amazon. This is the worst movie ever made on purpose.

55081,3,0783209967,"Amazon Women On The Moon starts off fast and funny, but ends up being kind of a mess.

55119,5,0783209967,"A series of sketches done by directors John Landis, Robert Weiss, Peter Horton, Carl Gottlieb and Joe Dante. This one satirizes televison culture from commercials, a man trapped in his own TV, video pirates, condom buying, porn and all the way to cheesy 50's Sci-fi movies.

Starring various actors and actresses like Michelle Pfeifer, Arsenio Hall, Phil Hartman, Monique Gabrielle, Sybil Dannig, Steve Forrest, Robert Colbert, Joey Travolta, David Alan Grier, Rip Taylor, B.B. King, Steve Guttenberg, Rosanna Arquette, Henry Silva, Jackie Vernon, Steve Allen, Andrew Dice Clay and Ed Begley Jr. This is a pure madcap sketch comedy that plays as a follow-up to the brilliant ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" as this one has sex and wild jokes with some funny while some are plain ok. I gotta give credit to Dante, Weiss, Landis and others making this long awaited follow-up, don't miss out on this unique parody movie that blows away the cruddy Friedberg and Seltzer ones you see today.

This DVD has a great transfer of picture and sound quality with few extras like deleted scenes, trailer, outtakes and recommendations. If you like Kentucky Fried Movie and UHF then this movie is for you.",1279497600,8,1181,5.020408163265306

Alot of the sketches are just tedious and have too few good jokes. But the strength of this movie is its running jokes and UNBELIEVABLE cast. Its a who's who of great 80s cult actors: David Alan Grier, Rip Taylor, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ed Begley Jr, Henry Silva, Joe Pantiliano, Kelly Preston, Arsenio Hall, TK Carter, Griffin Dunne, Steve Guttenberg, Rosanna Arquette. And all of them do well in their parts as mostly young comic actors. This film is a follow-up to Landis and Weiss' ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", but is far superior. Its precursor has aged horribly and isn't as funny to a modern audience. This film has some dry moments, but you'll enjoy the ride.",1247529600,,772,4.725925925925926

The ""movie"" which is chocked full of splices, is reminiscent of those old reeled movies we used to watch in school. the scenes would flicker, hop from one scene to the next. Like this one part when you have three astronauts arriving on the moon, then an instant later, two are talking to the moon women and as the conversation unfolds, you discover an entire scene in which the third astronaut died was cut out.

The commercials, however, are the icing on the cake. Funny and at least partly plausible, one could see them being actual commercials.

Imagine 84 minutes of good Saturday Night Live episodes strung together and you have some idea of what's in store for you in Amazon Women..  These small segments are strung together by a Late Night ""B"" movie (Amazon Women On The Moon) that keeps getting interuputed by advertisements (which are themselves skits) due to 'technical difficulties'.  It doesn't take long to get interested in this picture if you have a mind for parody and humor along the lines of say, ""Airplane"" in it's better moments.  The skits and segments change fairly quickly, though some are like running jokes recurring throughout.  It's good cheap fun, but fun it is!  Like when the kid goes into the drugstore to buy condoms and the old grandfatherly clerk (also a friend of the family of course) says, ""I'll bet I know what you want""

Kid: ""You do?""

""Sure, I was young once..  Licorice sticks!  They came in fresh this morning"", he says, pulling one out from a jar.

""Mr Gower, I'm 17 years old!""

""Already?  Seems like only yesterday your mom was in here buying talc to powder your little bottom!""

What follows after that could only be any teenagers nightmare..  But for us it's great fun..

This movie is recommended if you need a good laugh (or twenty) and can appreciate the ridiculous!  And yes, as this film has more than it's fair share of 't&a', it might be time to put the kiddies to bed... hopefully your laughing won't wake 'em up.",1207008000,,1467,4.64591439688716
55151,1,0783209967,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can appreciate satire and comedy skits but this collection of skits surrounding snippets of a campy space movie just doesn't work. Individually some of the skits are good or at least mildly amusing; like ""Two IDs"" starring Rosanna Arquette and Steve Guttenberg about a fact checking machine that does a history analysis of a man's dating history to let user's know if he's a good candidate. Or Ed Begley Jr. as the ""Son of the Invisible Man"" who doesn't realize he's not invisible and runs around naked.

The best part of the movie was looking out for the familiar faces, some who were popular in the 80s and some who are more popular now. They include the likes of Arsenio Hall, Phil Hartman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Peter Horton, Griffon Dunne, Joe Pantoliano, Joey Travolta, Steve Allen, B.B.

You can certainly tell that this title is fitting because like so many ""sequels"" it doesn't live up to the previous attempt. However, it does serve up some laughs, albeit uncomfortable ones at times. For instance I enjoyed the funeral/roast about half way through the movie. And the centerpiece movie, ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" was pretty amusing. It was like so many old cereals, cheesy special effects and models, over-the-top acting, all shot in what looks like Arizona desert with the sun shining so they didn't even try to cover that up which I thought was funny.

55175,4,0783209967,"The opening skit ""Apartment Victim"" with Arsenio Hall is pure slapstick--not my favorite comedy type but for some reason I found it hilarious.  I just cracked up on all the mishaps and the great timing by Arsenio and the cameras.  The way the video cassette shoots back out of the player and hits him and knocks him over was just so funny; and the way the TV blows up when he hits the remote was a crack up.

I also liked David Alan Grier as Don (No Soul) Simmons in the segment ""Blacks without Soul.""  The Laurence Welk way he sang the Broadway show type tunes was just a riot.  I also liked the skit featuring Rosanna Arquette, ""Two I.D.'s"" in which she takes the prospective date's credit cards and two forms of ID to investigate what kind of guy he is on a date.

I also kind of liked the comedic roast at the wake in ""Roast your loved one.""  Kind of.  The jokes ranged from funny but old to lame-o.

The overall shtick of this being a TV late night movie show was also good--the idea, anyway.  The featured movie ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" (actually this was a skit too; no such movie exists although one wonders why), which spoofs 50s cheapo sci-fi flicks was so, so very bad as to almost be campy--but not quite.  It was frankly just bad bad, and a little on the very cognitively challenged side, that is to say, dumb.

Overall this was a lot funnier than might be expected, at least for me, but then again I have actually watched most of the episodes of ""Married with Children"" although I would never admit it.",1166313600,,1518,4.306338028169014

Most of the sketches are fantastic and the stars include Lou Jacobi, Erica Yohn,  Michelle Pfeiffer, Steve Guttenberg, Rosanna Arquette, Griffin Dunne and Steve Forrest.

To me the major embarrassment was Slappy White's ""roast"" at the funeral. His off-color comments were awful. Even Steve Allen was obviously offended by them.

The highlights are many, especially Don ""No Soul"" Simmons and his frequent appearances plugging his albums; Arsenio Hall's back-firing apartment; the SON OF THE INVISIBLE MAN spoof (though why Ed Begley, Jr., was forced to wear a pouch over his genitals when he's supposed to be nude seems odd, especially considering the total nudity of the ""Pet-House Plaything"").

Anyway, though it's certainly not a thinking person's comedy, it's quite funny. I've watched it several times and enjoyed it.

55182,3,0783209967,"... a black person is born in this country with no soul?""  That's a line from on of the better skits in this film.  As much as I'd hate to admit it, I'd have to agree with Leonard Maltin in his describing most of the bits in the film Amazon Women on the Moon (1987) as being `unfunny'.  There are a handful worth looking for, which I'll mention later, but the majority just aren't that good.  In case you've never heard of this film, it's not a 1950's science fiction film, or even a spoof of a 1950's science fiction film (although there is a lengthy sketch contained within the film that is), but a series of parody sketches similar to other films like The Groove Tube (1974), The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977), and, to a lesser extent Mr. Mike's Mondo Video (1979), It Came from Hollywood (1982) and the short lived, early 80's television series `Likely Stories'.  The various segments feature direction by individuals like Joe Dante (Gremlins), Carl Gottlieb (Caveman), John Landis (Animal House), and Robert K. Weiss, producer of such films as The Kentucky Fried Movie and The Blues Brothers.  The film features a number of actors including, but not limited to, Arsenio Hall (Coming to America), Michelle Pfeiffer (Married to the Mob), Griffin Dunne (After Hours), Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix), Joey Travolta, older brother to the much more famous John Travolta, who does not appear in this film, Sybil Danning (Chained Heat), David Alan Grier (Jumanji), B.B. King, Rosanna Arquette (Desperately Seeking Susan), Steve Guttenberg (Police Academy), Belinda Balaski (The Howling), Robert Picardo (Small Soldiers), Ed Begley Jr. (This Is Spinal Tap), Kelly Preston (Mischief), Dick Miller (Rock 'n' Roll High School), Howard Hesseman (Doctor Detroit), Carrie Fisher (Star Wars), and Paul Bartel (Eating Raoul).

Of the many segments in the film, there were about five that stood out as ranging from moderately funny to hilarious.  `Roast Your Loved Ones' featured a skit about a service that roasts the dearly departed creating a rather lively and entertaining wake, employing comedians like Rip Taylor, Slappy White, Jackie Vernon, Henny Youngman, Charlie Callas (was this guy ever funny?), and Steve Allen.  It's wonderful seeing these older comics doing their schtick, riffing on not only the recently dead, but each other, especially since as I write this four of them have since passed on...the next segment worth looking for was the bit titled `Son of the Invisible Man' featuring Ed Begley Jr. as the title character.  Believing he's recreated his father's formula, he prances around playing pranks and such, but in reality, he's not invisible, just naked, and the folks sort of go along with the idea, humoring him.  This bit works especially well if you've actually seen the original 1933 Invisible Man film featuring Claude Rains, directed by James Whale.  The 3rd bit I enjoyed was titled `Titan Man' and involves a young man and what happens when he tries to buy condoms from the local pharmacy.  The 4th was a bit played after the credits, featuring Paul Bartel and Carrie Fisher, titled `Reckless Youth' and was a parody of those health films release back in the 50's intended to frighten viewers away from `immoral' activities by showing the harsh and tragic consequences surely to result and often uses words or phrases like unclean, impure, sinful ways, secret shame, social diseases, and shameful affliction.  Finally, my favorite segment of the film was actually a few short segments that comprised a running gag throughout the film, the first being a commercial where B.B. King laments on the alarming condition of `Blacks Without Soul', and features some of the funniest bits as we see various examples of African Americans who truly have `no soul'.  The stand out here is David Alan Grier as a black singer who croons the most white bread tunes imaginable, completely bereft of any soul.  He then appears in a couple of more commercial segments later on as Don 'No Soul' Simmons, promoting albums featuring his particular take on popular songs including `Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Old Oak Tree' and `Joy To The World'.

It seems liked producer Robert K. Weiss and director John Landis tried to revisit the comic greatness of The Kentucky Fried Movie, which they also produced and directed respectively, but they neglected to bring back one critical element in that of the writers Jim Abrahams, and the Zuckers (David and Jerry), the men responsible for such hits as Airplane! (1980), Top Secret! (1984), and The Naked Gun (1988).  Writers Michael Barrie and Jim Mulholland are certainly accomplished in their own right, both having previously worked on such shows like ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"" and ""Mary Tyler Moore"", but they lacked the edge Abrahams and the Zuckers brought to The Kentucky Fried Movie.  Subsequently what you have here is a series of lukewarm bits propped up by few, pretty good scenes.  There are a couple of scenes involving former Penthouse Pets Monique `36D-25-37' Gabrielle (Munchie) and Corinne `37-23-36' Wahl (Spring Break) getting all nekkid (not together), so that sure didn't hurt (hence, the main reason for the R rating)...the film flowed along alright, but it was weird when it kicked into the credits after about an hour and fifteen minutes, and I found myself saying, `Damn, that film was short'...and then after the credits there was that last skit entitled `Reckless Youth', which ran about ten minutes, stretching the overall runtime to about 1 hour and 25 minutes.  They do have Don `No Soul' Simmons singing over the end credits so audiences would probably keep watching and catch this last sketch, but if not, keep in mind it's there.

The wide screen anamorphic (1.85:1) looks very good on this DVD, and the Dolby Digital Mono 2.0 English comes though relatively well throughout.  Special features include some deleted and alternate scenes, an original theatrical trailer, outtakes, and some recommendations (basically for other John Landis films).

They totally cut out the part where they demonstrate how the hair stays on after the guy jumps of the cliffs of Acculpoco and the police drag his body to the shore and smile because the hair stayed on. (sp?).  Why???  That was one of the funniest parts! I think there are a couple of other small omisions in there too - need to go all through it again, but the point is while a fantastic movie, they cut stuff out!  I don't get it.

55209,3,0783209967,"In 1987, a group of five directors (Joe Dante, Carl Gottlieb, Peter Horton, John Landis and Robert Weiss) worked together to create a silly spoof of 1950's sci-fi films called ""Amazon Women on the Moon"".  Each director focused on specific segments of the film to create the illusion that the audience is watching the fictitious film ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" from the 1950's interspersed with television commercials and other segments.  Some of the main segments in the film include the following:
1. ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" with Capt. Nelson (Steve Forrest), Blackie (Robert Colbert), Butch (Joey Travolta), Queen Lara (Sybil Danning) and Alpha Beta (Lana Clarkson).  This segment follows the astronauts traveling to the moon and finding a group of beautiful women living there.
2. ""Murray in Videoland"" with Murray (Lou Jacobi) and Selma (Erica Yohn).  Murray gets more than he expected after purchasing a new TV.
3. ""Mondo Condo"" with an apartment victim played by Arsenio Hall.  Arsenio gets a few surprises in his apartment.
4. ""Hospital"" with Brenda (Michelle Pfeiffer), Harry (Peter Horton), Doctor (Griffin Dunne) and the nurse (Brian Ann Zoccola).  Not a hospital you would want to be in.
5. ""Blacks Without Soul"" with Don 'No Soul' Simmons (David Alan Grier) and B.B. King as himself.  Funny spoofs of songs.
6. ""Roast Your Loved One"" with Harvey Pitnik (Archie Hahn), Bernice Pitnik (Belinda Balaski), Rick Raddnitz (Robert Picardo), Rip Taylor as himself, Slappy White as himself, Jackie Vernon as himself, Henny Youngman as himself, Charlie Callas as himself and Steve Allan as himself.  Some silly jokes, but no great acting.
With such a huge cast, it's no wonder that the beginning credits only say ""A lot of actors"" instead of listing each one by name.  Of the various segments, the ones listed above are the ones that I enjoyed the most.  Since the film is intended to be segmented, having different directors control different segments is beneficial to the film instead of a hindrance.  Being a spoof, the acting is intended to be silly, and that's how the film comes across.
Overall, I rate ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" with 3 out of 5 stars.  I don't necessarily recommend purchase of the film on DVD, but it's certainly worth being rented if you have never seen it.",1062460800,4,2288,4.945169712793733

The skits wrap around a spoof of a 1950's style science fiction movie (the title, with Steve Forrest in the starring role).  Perhaps this movie might have worked better had it just been a sci-fi spoof but it is bogged down by weak and unfunny bits.  For example, there is the naked girl in church (ha ha) and the Steve Guttenberg/Rosanna Arquette sketch about a device that checks out men before a women dates them.  There is also a sketch with Michelle Pfeiffer and Peter Horton as new parents, and Griffin Dunne as a doctor who has lost their baby.  There is also a dreadfully unfunny sketch at then end of the movie with Carrie Fisher as a patient with social disease.

7790367,5,0783209967,"Between the introduction of cable TV and the disappearance of the ""veractor"" (knob) tuner on the set came this zesty 1987 spoof of the television medium.  An honest working guy (Arsenio Hall), returning home after a rough day at work, decides to veg out in front of the tube.  Unfortunately for him, and happily for us, he loses control of what he sees.  AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON is for anyone who has fallen asleep in front of the set and awakened to wonder WHAT the heck is going on . . . in this case a trashy Fifties sci-fi flick, ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" (based on a real Fifties movie starring Zsa Zsa Gabor), which alternates with practically the whole of our culture, in comic form, with all its capacity for schlock and awe. A flock of terrific actors like Patricia Arquette, Griffin Dunne, Michelle Pfeiffer, Lou Jacobi, Bryan Cranston and Steve Guttenberg lend their talents to this uninhibited and occasionally profane production, with fake commercials and TV junk like ""Titan Man"" alternating with the lunar lovelies.  Surprisingly, the kind of unfair fare broadcast TV tosses at us hasn't changed that much in the last thirty years.  If you like to laugh (and observe the ""R"" rating), this one is for you.  The price is currently so low that the DVD is worth it just for David Alan Grier singing ""Blame It On the Bossa Nova"" as the poor African-American entertainer who has NO soul.  A winner!",1495497600,2,1409,4.634538152610442
