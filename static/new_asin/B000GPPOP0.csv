8133818,5,B000GPPOP0,"A very good film about this most talented of female artists whose influence still resonates so emphatically today in the work of many current female musicians, uses some very rare footage to tell Sandy's story in a tasteful and unique way. 5 Stars",1440720000,,247,4.767441860465116

8133820,2,B000GPPOP0,"I'm a huge Sandy Denny fan, but this video was difficult for me to get through. It's basically five men (including two Fairport members) talking about Denny. Interesting in theory, but often times stories are repeated, and the project feels like a bit of a cash grab at her fanbase. Very few videoclips of Sandy actually playing. Probably about 15 minutes of footage of her in the whole video.

I'd highly recommend reading Clinton Heylin's ""No More Sad Refrains"" biography on Denny over watching this DVD.",1336780800,3,506,4.883720930232558
8133821,5,B000GPPOP0,"This documentary is brilliant--a very thorough accounting of Sandy Denny's career that shows what an amazing but troubled talent she was.  The musicians speaking on Sandy bring very impressive credentials, including some of the most important figures from the British folk and folk-rock movement such as Martin Carthy, John Renbourn, David Swarbrick and others.  The portions of the documentary on Sandy's merger with Fairport are absolutely fascinating.  Very cogent analysis of the unfortunate combination of factors that prevented Sandy's star from rising the way it should have.  Amazon's only offering region 2 DVD's at this point as far as I can see, but there is an all-region DVD version available from cd universe as I write this.",1304208000,2,739,5.2905982905982905
8133822,5,B000GPPOP0,"First, an FYI, the copy of this DVD that I received is not Region 2, as advertised; it's ""All Regions (0),"" which I've been told means it's pretty much viewable everywhere. It played fine on my DVD unit, but if it hadn't I would've just watched it on my computer. That's worked with Region 2 DVDs before.

As for the documentary, I agree with those who wrote that it's an excellent program for devotees of Denny and her music. It lacks a complete performance of any song, but its purpose is to provide insight into her life, which it handles marvelously. Denny was an incredibly talented artist and performer beset with personal insecurities. Working for a public radio station in the 1970s, I had an opportunity for a brief interview following her performance as the opening act at a Shawn Phillips concert in Detroit. Unfortunately, the interview was largely forgettable (she politely granted the interview though she wanted to watch Phillips perform). What this documentary did, however, was transport me back in time to that conversation, giving me a feel for what was going on in her professional and personal life during the period that she was trying to launch a solo career. I wish I could do the interview now having the background information that this documentary provided. The conversation would not have been forgettable.",1274227200,3,1334,4.902654867256637
8133823,4,B000GPPOP0,"If you're looking for a lot of footage of Sandy performing live, or of interviews of Sandy herself, you'll be disappointed.  Precious little video exists of Sandy's performances and/or interviews.  Remember, this is pre-Youtube, folks.

However, the interviews conducted for this disc are very good.  Fairport members Dave Swarbrick and Dave Mattacks are fairly extensively interviewed (Mattacks comments and observations are probably the most spot-on) and journalists Colin Irwin and (Fairport biographer) Patrick Humphries offer great insight to Sandy, both solo and with Fairport.  Fotheringay drummer Gerry Conway (eerily sounding a lot like Richard Thompson) offers his memories of Sandy, which are quite touching.

Guitarist and Steeleye Span member Martin Carthy is also interviewed and is his usual feisty self.  Very entertaining.

It would have been interesting to hear Joe Boyd's insights/memories of Sandy.  It was Joe who always pushed for a solo career for Sandy (and Richard Thompson).  Boyd may well have been responsible for the destruction of Fairport.  He certainly didn't have much use for them after the departure of Denny and Thompson.

Thompson's memories of Sandy would have also been nice to see, but he's said enough about Sandy in the past.

Tantalizingly brief footage of Sandy solo (on piano), a live Fotheringay gig (performing ""Too Much Of Nothing,"") and some decent live B&W footage of Fairport circa 1974 round out the documentary.

In all, a good documentary of a singer who should be/have been far more popular than she is/was.",1262131200,2,1562,5.348360655737705
8133824,5,B000GPPOP0,"I'd read a few indifferent reviews of this DVD (released back in 2006) in various places so waited until I could get a good price on a copy before taking a chance. Having now seen it I must say that I haven't enjoyed anything this much in a long time. It is true that the music clips are all quite short, but that doesn't matter one jot if you already have them all in your collection anyway.  If you aren't familiar with much of Sandy's music or life story, then the insights from the journalists and musicians probably won't be all that inspiring. However, if you already know most of the story and have been playing the albums for years then you'll find the aforementioned insights both informative and, at times, heart-rending.  In fact I'm not ashamed to admit that I was on the verge of tears for almost the entire documentary ('documentary' being certainly the most appropriate term to describe this work).  Of course this is coming from an old geezer who, as a 17 year-old, sold his copy of the Move's first album to part finance the purchase of Fairport's ""What We did on our Holidays"" the moment it was released.
When the news of Sandy's tragic and untimely passing came through, I was actually presenting a radio show in Hamilton, Ontario. As part of a tribute to Sandy that night I played ""I'll Keep it With Mine"" from that very same vinyl copy that I had taken over with me when I moved to Canada from the UK.
At one point during the DVD a comment is made that by the mid 'seventies Fairport were not really attracting any new fans and that at each gig they ""knew virtually everyone in the audience"". They were very much this tightly knit community that could never quite break out into the mainstream. While the pundits are lamenting this fact, the great irony is that this production falls into exactly the same pigeon hole. It really is one for the devotees. If you want to discover the music then go check out the original albums.  When all the songs have become ingrained into your soul, come back and watch this documentary. Having said all that I'm still giving it five stars. For someone like me who grew up in the '60's in northern England, the priceless footage of Radio Caroline sailing into Ramsey Bay to the strains of ""A Sailor's Life"" is alone worth the purchase price of this DVD.  Tears of nostalgia? You bet - pass the tissues.",1215907200,16,2358,4.487179487179487
8133825,2,B000GPPOP0,I was hopeing to see Sandy Denny perform but was disappointed. Only small clips. A lot of talk from people who knew her. I was hopeing for a DVD with Sandy performing.,1213833600,2,167,4.25
8133826,5,B000GPPOP0,"I was apprehensive about this DVD as it said Region 2, however it played beautifully on my machine and the quality is good. If you're a Sandy Denny fan this is a must-have.",1212624000,4,172,4.242424242424242
