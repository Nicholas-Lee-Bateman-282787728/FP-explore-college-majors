1388129,3,B0000524DL,"I first saw ""Sweet November"" as a Junior in high school in 1968.  I was 17 and my two girlfriends were 16 and we absolutely loved this movie and cried all of the way from the theatre to our homes and even more when Sandy Dennis (Sara Deaver) lets Anthony Newly (Charlie Blake) leave and her next human salvage project, Mr. December (Gordon) arrives. Charlie and Sara are in LOVE, and even though Charlie knows of Sara's secret and reason for her ""man of the month crusade"", he leaves and she lets him leave.  This was probably our very first movie where they didn't live ""happily ever after"" but as we were young and naive, we were so upset that she allowed him to leave.  The three of us have remained friends and never until just recently when the movie was remade with Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron have any of us seen the movie as it was not released in video until this new remake film.  It has never (as far as we have seen in over 30 years) been on television , even as a late night movie.  Recently upon just briefly surfing amazon.com< i found it, ordered it, received it and watched it.  While I did not cry as hard as I did in 1968, some tears were shed.  I have experienced much pain in love and have found that life is not always ""happily ever after"" as too many films portray.  I look forward to seeing the new one and will maybe purchase that also. But for anyone who wants a sappy, totally 60's - 70's revival, this is the video for you.  Even my staunch, never cry a tear 16 year old commented ""it was pretty good""  and shed a tear or two.  After this of course came ""Love Story"", ""Ghost"", ""Sommersby"", and many other films without a ""happily ever after"" ending.  I am very happy that I had a chance to purchase it.  With Amazon.com I ordered it on Sunday p.m. and it arrived 5 days later and was a joy to watch and pass on to my friends.",992304000,17,1858,4.2
1388130,5,B0000524DL,"I was so excited to see the original film available to buy. I have looked everywhere. I saw this movie on television when I was just a kid and the story line and acting impacted me so much that it was one of the few movies I actually remembered, other than poplular classics, all of my life. When I saw the commercial for the new movie I told everyone that it was a remake because I remembered the original movie and it's incredible impact it had on my life. Even the original movie made me think of how valueable life is and how important it is to savour every moment.  The acting from both actors in the original movie was superior and believable. The newer movie had excellent acting as well but the original movie was unmatchable.",988761600,9,734,4.357664233576642
1388131,5,B0000524DL,I have been waiting to buy this video for years!  First saw this movie in Viet Nam...and fell in love with the charming character played by Sandy Dennis.  I was hoping for a release on VHS of the old movie...it has so much more than the modern release...much more plot development.....and the greenwich village apartment with a skylight had far more possibilities than a small LA apartment.  Maybe i am an aging sentimentalist........but i prefer the original.,983923200,14,460,4.9480519480519485
1388132,5,B0000524DL,"I loved the Sandy Dennis, Anthony Newley original, from the first time I saw it on the big screen in the 60's. It has a unique feel and Sandy Dennis lives in the coolest, most unbelievable Brooklyn Heights apartment/loft, back before spaces like this were ""in."" She has to be seen to be believed, in a role unlike ANY of her others...I was entranced from the moment she appeared onscreen in her white go-go type boots and the oversized hat she was wearing. On her it works, which is probably why she was able to pull off the eccentric character of Sarah, the perfect foil for the rather uptight Charlie played by Anthony Newley. See this movie!  Now for my 2nd reason for posting this review. I wanted to know how the soon-to-be released remake compared, not released when i originally wrote this review,  starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron.

P.S. I was right. Took awhile to get back to this review to edit it. Have now seen the updated version of Sweet November. Ouch. Hated it.",982022400,6,987,4.564971751412429
1388133,5,B0000524DL,"Anthony Newley is Charlie Blake, a British businessman that is described by Sara Deever as ""hurry, hurry, ding, ding""--a man moving so fast she can't see him.  Sandy Dennis is Sara, a young Brooklynite that moves Charlie to trade in his blank verse for ""mostly calm, mostly wild, mostly woman, no...mostly child"".
The two meet under odd circumstances that threaten to label their relationship strained at best.  But, Sara sees a project in Charlie--and he's not her first.  Sara has--for reasons to be determined much later--been taking on romanctic partners on a one-month-only basis.  Men she thinks she can help with one shortcoming or another.  After a brief get-to-know-you, she invites Charlie to be her November.  No one could have predicted what November would bring--not Sara, not Charlie.  The story is propelled by the comings and goings of the men from months past and those to come as Sara doles out her own brand of therapy.
Anthony Newley has some great little comedic gems.  Sandy Dennis is so youthful and sweet in her delivery, you believe in what Sara is doing.  The last fifteen minutes of the movie pack a sentimental whollop.
I'll never think of November the same way.",980985600,7,1190,4.91
1388134,5,B0000524DL,"Anthony Newley made this movie with Sandy Dennis after the release of 'Dr Dolittle' and before his marathon 'Heironymus Merkin' film. Newley is quite simply perfect as the ""hurry, hurry, ding ding"" British businessman in America, and the perfect foil for Sandy Dennis's marvelous character of Sara Deevers. Their on screen magic is both heartwarming and tear jerking - tugging at the heart strings at all the right moments. This magic is made more so with the knowledge that Newley and Dennis didn't exactly see eye to eye - as was told to me by Tony during my video programme interview with him back in 1993. The ultimate in bittersweet love stories from an age gone by. Anthony Newley also sings the theme song (written by Leslie Bricusse and himself) over the end credits.

1388151,5,B0000524DL,"I saw 2001 first and disliked it. I gave it 1 Star. I found out it was a remake so I made myself watch the 1968 version to find out why they would remake it. They should not have made the 2001 version. THIS is the one to watch.

It is a quirky love story that holds up better in the 1960's with the quirky and lovely Sandy Dennis. (No one can ever be made to believe that Charlize Theron could believably play this quirky character. Maybe Jennifer Aniston.)

The way these characters meet at a DMV office is the same in both movies but less hostile in the 1968 version.  The apartment in the 1968 version is cuter, more alive, more personality.

This was a happier, funnier, more romantic love story with, still, a sad ending but better than the 2001 version.

If you want to see a cute romantic movie that has held up well in almost 50 years, this is one to try.

It's really a 3 to 4 Star movie but I'm giving it 5 Stars because I want you to see this one, not the other. The other one should be deleted.

Plus an extra star for the cool 1960's vibe.",1463184000,,1052,4.077669902912621

1388154,1,B0000524DL,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Imagine this my friends, Sandy Dennis in a quirky, mad capped, pseudo intellectual gab fast with strangers. Always maintaining a stuttering, breathless, staccato with bizarre non-sequitur observational quips, I already had my fill since viewing ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf""!!

After viewing the less quirky version with Reeves and Theron, I read the reviews that claimed this older incarnation was a much more truthful and honest version and I succumbed. What a stupid dolt!

The icing on the cake was both the 7 sided box and Mr. December who had his coat sleeve attack him. Now that's pure comedy for like 1927? Who wrote this script, I loathe your crackpot efforts to define an era.

Anyone with a serious fatal chronic illness would not just have a bit of a chill OUTSIDE in the winter, or have a few medications to hide. What a disservice to those who truly suffer from complications of an incurable disease and wanting to have close connections to those they love. This film is a complete bore and has absolutely no redeeming values. I even discount the NYC scapes.

This woman cheats men, her landlords, and most of all herself. I guess that everyone deals with their mortality in different ways. I am very impressed with this young girls escapism and manipulation of others for her own agenda. Wonderful impact and role model for future generations. I mean the author has you feeling sorry for this sub-human.

...because it was actually not a happy ending.  I was saying ""no!"" when Charlie ended up leaving and it was obviously final.  I mean, yes he agreed to her wishes yet I feel that it would have ended better if she did finally give in to having found love and accepted a man who would be there for her and love her and realized that if someone loves someone, they are willing to go through the difficult times too.

While yes it was very interesting to see someone whose goal was to make transformations in others, it would have been a ""sweeter"" end if in the final part of the film, the transformation in Sara had happened too.  I feel that while her cause was noble, she in fact had issues that needed to be worked on and she needed to allow herself to love someone.  I don't feel that this bittersweet ending was one of those endings where it was the right thing to have happened.  It was a bit of a tragedy in the end.

Otherwise, this was a very touching and moving story.  I had originally seen the recent version with Keanu Reeves and I do have to say that I was more moved by this one.  Mainly because of this Charlie's character.  I enjoyed his personality better than Keanu's character.",1428192000,2,1318,4.266129032258065

1388203,5,B0000524DL,"I've decided to try to get copies of all my most favorite ""secret sappy romance"" movies.  I'm not generally the sappy type, but there are a few movies that I will claim for this category.  And this is one of them.  I always loved this particular rendition because Denny feels so fragile and vulnerable, but is strong inside--not just the character she plays here but I think the actress was really like that.  Denny captured the character perfectly.  And I just always like Newley, although some other Brit actor might have been able to play the role just as well.  There was always something slightly gritty about Newley (not sure what).  Which made for a good contrast in this movie.  Oh, and let us not forget the New York backdrop--always my favorite place in movies (there's just something romantic about NYC).  So, I'm getting this and it's going in my DVD library along side Brazil (to me, it's romantic), The Enchanted Cottage (if I can find a copy) and whatever other ones I can find.  I did view the Keanu Reeves remake and as much as I like Reeves, that remake completely missed the mark--maybe the main characters were too pretty so the deeper stuff was lost, maybe the movie needed the friggin' iciness of NY winter to make the point.  I mean, had they called Reeves' movie something else it probably would have been fine.  But as a remake of ""Sweet November"" it missed some essential to the story.",1376611200,,1411,4.6

Even allowing for the different styles of the different era (excruciating musical score for one instance) Newley's teddy boy stove pipe pants and Sandy Dennis sack dress, this still underwhelmed. Newley's strange mincing mannerisms render him absurd as the male lead. Keanu in this sense is in fairness the logical heir to the role but easily outdoes Newley in overall appeal.
Charmwise-Sandy Dennis is roughly equal to Theron although her feyness is intense and unrelenting which I suppose played better then than now.
If the latest version is perhaps a B or B-, this is a D charitably. The male lead is a mystery of casting and an F-.

I enjoyed this movie very much! It has this special, typical mixture of the late sixties between musical and Drama, especially, when A.Newley declares S.Dennis his love on ThanksGivingDay. This shift from light happiness to sadness is wonderful. Hear to the wonderful background music!
The 2001 Version of ""Sweet November"" with Keanu Reeves (which is very nice) brought me to this movie from 1968. But please don't compare the two. I don't like remakes, but the merit oft the 2001 version is, that the Orginal was published.
And after all, I think the 1968-Orginal-version is much more romantic and Flower Power - and less Kitsch !!  And I like the title Song ""Sweet November"" sung by Anthony Newley.
If you like Anthony Newley, then buy ""Dr. Dolittle"" from 1967! This also brings back old memories and a fantastic soundtrack.",1278460800,3,996,5.148148148148148
1388226,5,B0000524DL,"Forget the pathetic remake--the original with Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley is a classic in every sense of the word. What a wonderful, romantic, and ultimately heartbreaking film!

Anthony Newley absolutely shines in this--and Sandy Dennis is wonderful as always, she truly soars here.  You don't just watch this movie--you feel it, right in the heart, unlike so many empty 'rom-coms' of today.

I'm so pleased with these new Warner Archives releases (this is my 2nd purchase from that particular imprint, the other being the wonderful, overlooked ""The Fox""--also starring Sandy Dennis).  This is a pristine print of the film, the soundtrack is amazingly crisp, and the dialogue comes through clear as a bell.  I am so happy to finally own this film--and in such great condition--for myself, forever.

I remember crying when first watching this as a child when it came out in movie theaters, and last night it got me again--I was sobbing for a good long time after the movie ended.  So very touching and unforgettable.  One of the few films that, for me, had a real feel for the actual experience of love and loss. A great, timeless film that still packs an emotional wallop. The final, lingering scene with Newley ripped my heart out. Outstanding.",1272240000,4,1250,4.919047619047619
1388237,5,B0000524DL,"Having been a movie buff since I was 10 years old I have wanted to see Sweet November for quite a number of years but for some reason it has remained elusive. Having never seen the movie I must admitn that i was in two minds as to whether or not to purchase it, given that it is alot more expensive to purchase it through Amazon.com than it is to purchase it from [...]. I am glad that i did. Sweet November tells the story of Sara, a childlike kook living in Brooklyn, who takes in a different man each month. The idea is to take a man who shows obvious flaws in order that she can change him and release him back into the world at the stroke of midnight on the last day of the month. Into Sara's like walks Charlie (Mr November), a workaholic who Sara thinks is worth saving. The only problem is that Charlie falls in love with Sara! The movie draws you in right from the opening credits to the heart-breaking final scene. The ending is probably one of the most beautifully poignant scenes ever captured on celluloid. I highly recommend Sweet November. Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley work well together, helping to create a believable and likable pair. Sweet November is one of those forgotten movies which thankfully, due to the Warners Archive Collection series, has been salvaged from that big movieland of forgotten movies. I highly recommend this movie. It stays with you long after you have viewed it. And yes, it is the type of movie that will not gather dust amongst your dvd collection due to lack of use. A truly wonderful movie!",1269302400,8,1542,4.4522968197879855

It is certainly dated with some rather odd dialogue and stilted acting by a few of the supporting actors, and it didn't tug on my heartstrings the way I remember it did all those years ago, but it is such a delight to get to watch Anthony Newley that I didn't care.

1388239,5,B0000524DL,"As a child of the 60s and 70s, I grew up with Anthony Newley's songs as a soundtrack to my life--and never really knew it. If you look back he's everywhere.  Remember the Goldfinger song?  He (with writing partner Leslie Bricusse) wrote it--along with all those  tunes you loved in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. His performances in Dr. Dolittle and Sweet November (impress your date with this one, guys) are well worth revisiting--or discovering for the first time.  Newley should not be underestimated--he is a legendary figure in pop culture and music. He committed himself to his performances completely.  Dig a little and you'll be rewarded. His music, television appearances and live performances will make you smile (YouTube is a great start-- check out his '65 Ed Sullivan performance of ""Who Can I Turn To?"").  He's up there with the icons of his time; there's a reason Sammy Davis, Jr. covered his tunes with brilliant success. Tony was a HEAVY CAT, mannnn-- a rags to riches story that, thankfully, leaves a legacy of great music and performances for us to enjoy and share with those who haven't met Tony yet. They don't make 'em like Anthony Newley anymore.  So buy, ""beg, steal or borrow [your] share of laughter)"" and add another DVD to your collection.  You can put this one in the classics section, and prepare to shed a tear or two between the laughs--Sweet November has a bitter-sweetness that will linger into December and then some.",1263600000,3,1460,4.835341365461847
1388240,5,B0000524DL,"There are few films as emotionally involving as SWEET NOVEMBER.  By the time the two leads (Anthony Newley as Charley Blake and Sandy Dennis as Sara Deever) meet, they share a chemistry that does not do justice to the word.  Theirs is not the celluloid sharing of self that marks most films but their pairing resonates with the best of Hollywood matings.  Charley Blake meets Sara Deever and is smitten.  She is Greenwich Village vintage kooky.  One almost does not like her for that.  She seems so shallow next to the earnest but slightly nebbish Charley.  She begins to grow in a manner that causes the viewer to see her as if a kaleidescope were involved.  She asks him to move in--but with one catch.  He must agree to stay only for one month and then leave with no fuss or question.  He agrees, thinking that he'll probably move out sooner since she's defintely off center.  To his great surprise, he falls for her but suspects that his feelings for her are one way only.  How the film works its way out does not manifest itself until near the end, but the manner in which they interact is highlighted by the setting.  Her apartment is as quirky as she is; it smacks of a slightly seedy East Village two room.  When they take a walk along the East River, New York City and its skyline take center stage but yet we never lose sight that amidst the teeming city of millions a drama is being played out that is variously comedic, romantic, and ultimately tragic. As unsure as Charley is as to where he stands so are we about where she does.  In the end, we learn a universal truism: that some people choose to travel a road that is fraught with obstacles and we can either help or get out of the way.  Charley Blake is in just such a situation.",1263081600,2,1746,4.375776397515528

I don't think there has been a film with the chemistry that Newley and Dennis have. I wouldn't change a scene or a word. And, as in ""The Apartment,"" Sarah's apartment is almost the main character. And Newley and Dennis just plain become Charlie and Sarah-from the first minute. The screenplay is perfection. It achieves the ultimate goal: you care about the characters. It is as though you already know them, as though they were your college buddies for four years. At the risk of sounding like a lib, you are feeling everything they do every minute of the story, even as it is happening. You know what they are going to do and feel the next minute, and the next. You have an insistant inkling of what's going to happen; and like a dream while you are dreaming it, you are unable to stop it, to change it, to make it end the way you want it to end. If you are a guy, you are Charlie; and if you are a girl, you are Sarah. It is nothing short of a  gift that this film has survived. And the final scene in the apartment. November is over.

1388243,5,B0000524DL,"Where do I begin to tell you what a relief to see that this classic has been made available for home viewing.  It was 1975 and I was 11 years old watching late night TV when a movie, I have never heard of, came on and I was immediately drawn in. Truly captivated by Anthony Newley and Sandy Dennis. I was exposed to my very first tear-jerker and to say I was touched would be a complete understatement. For years, every week I would scan through my TV Guide to find it but to no avail. This was a day when all Movies did not go to VHS after it's release. In my 20's I actually went to see Anthony Newley live in ""Stop The World I Want To Get Off"" (which he wrote and starred in) at a local theatre. My quest was to meet him and ask when I will see ""Sweet November"" again. After the show I begged to go backstage to meet him and my wishes were granted. There he was, a little man in a grey sweat suit still drying his hair with a towel. He was thrilled that I asked and responded that he had just had lunch with the writer of the movie the other day and ""Sweet November's"" future came up. No plans were set in stone at that time, he said. Fast forward, Anthony passed on and low and behold the rebirth of Sweet November came to life with Keanu Reeves. Unfortunately to my dismay it couldn't hold a candle to the original which will always have a special place in my heart. I am now 43 and oddly my daughter (my Angel) was born in November. Guess what I call her?  Buy this movie!

1388244,5,B0000524DL,"I just thought of this and bought it instantly.  If you want to draw comparisons, do so with Backstreet and Madam X but NOT the Keanu Reeves version.  Much as I adore Keanu, his cannot compare to the Anthony Newley/Sandy Dennis combination that was the first Sweet November.  I saw this movie when it opened in NYC (in those days to see first run movies you had to go uptown to the big theatres - local theatres would get them about a month or two later).  I was 17 and remembered the last time I felt my heart break for a movie was West Side Story.  I must thank Barry Eysman who wrote his review in 2002.  It said beautifully everything I would like to say.  My eyes filled up when I read it.  I think the thing that made the original characters so appealing was they were not drop-dead gorgeous with leading man/lady good looks.  They were believable.  I felt as if I knew these people or at least could know them and relate to them.  Since I saw this movie, every time I smell a new perfume on someone that appeals to me, I say ""you smell like the main floor of Bloomingdale's"".",1192579200,2,1082,4.229268292682927

1388246,5,B0000524DL,"How wonderful there are reviews by customers who so much like this movie. who have also longed to see it again and who have waited for it to be available. I too love it, have remembered it vividly ever since it was first released, and think it a great thing to have it finally here.
Anthony Newley and Sandy Dennis worked beautifully together. Theodore Bikel is so comforting, strong and protective. It is a tender, sad and beguiling story by Herman Raucher, every bit the equal of his ""Summer of '42"" and that is complimenting it indeed. A rare and heady blend of deepest emotion, of what love can do to persons, and what the terrible thrusting of the end of the world causes--the bittersweet romance, the gone away, but not in the heart ever leaving, the one special romance that aches the soul is always the finest, the most cherished.
Unabashedly bigger than life, very much an old fashioned ""romantic film,"" filled with happiness and passion, and captivating. I've loved Anthony Newley for most of my life. Sandy Dennis is one of my favorite actresses. It needed no remake. Keneau Reeves in the Newley role? Oh, please, no. There is just this one and only classic November. It is impossible not to weep when Charlie so desperately wants Sweet November to stay, to capture the fleeting time, and to make a calander with only that month forever on it, caught in amber.
 Which is what this film has done. How can anyone not fall in love with a story in which Charlie names the sweater Sarah makes for him, because he loves it, ""Rex""?  New York has never been more captivating. Michel LeGrand's music is sublime. Fall and Thanksgiving and Sarah and Charlie and a most creatively sided box, and snow falling on the skylight. What more could a person wish for? The final magnificent song by Newley and Leslie Bricusse, sung in that electrifying Newley voice that will never be equaled, as the snow comes falling down around him on a park bench, his final goodbye, encompassing all the knowledge Sarah has given to him, for all hellos are goodbyes in disguise, breaks my heart every time I hear it. There can be no better, wiser ""sentimental education.""
Even if Sandy Dennis did not look like my first love, I would have liked her immensely--tender, sad and trembly always it seemed, a delicate rose at the beginning of Fall, all the more lyrical for that. But November can't stay; it's why autumn is so magical. Now that both actors are so sadly gone, we have this gift of love and innocence to remember them by; a study of the kind of affection that counts, that gets into the bones, and joyous memories edged with the patina of sadness. New York in autumn has always seemed the best place in the world to me. This film has proven me right.
Forever bless Anthony Newley, a giant of the musical stage, a sad sweet wise clown whose heart always seemed to be breaking;  nevermore so than here. And Sandy Dennis, ""mostly woman, mostly child.""
The heart remembers, for that way, November is never ""wintry and gray"". Thanks to grand films like this, we see firmly, just why.",1025654400,49,3068,4.605118829981718
