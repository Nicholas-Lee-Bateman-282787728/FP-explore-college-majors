7973048,3,B00006SFLO,"This DVD is from the video tape ""Live In Concert"" released in 1998 but recorded in 1987. It's unfortunate, with Marc in his prime, that this sounds poor. The band seems to be missing a bass player, or the bass is off, and the drums sound like popcorn.  The drums sound so thin it becomes distracting, but Marc is still brimming with charm as he sings beautifully. The extra footage may be rare but Marc's mic is too loud, thus distorting it so much making it practically unlistenable.

Overall though, if you're a fan then this is still worth having.

There is a much better live video of Marc called ""Twelve Years of Tears"" at London's Royal Albert Hall 1992, which from what I know is not on DVD yet.",1171411200,,702,4.384615384615385
