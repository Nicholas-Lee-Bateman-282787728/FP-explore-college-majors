7915914,5,B00002E206,"Based on the Bible chapter of The Acts of the Apostles,the movie is set in the time of our Lord. This mini-series covers the story of the early church. It lets one know that these events took place during recorded history,and has the Roman Emperor who was in power at the time. It should have been given more coverage over the years since NBC aired it in 1985. But here it is. See my book review as well.",1072828800,2,404,4.1923076923076925
7915915,5,B00002E206,"This is an incredibly moving account of the post crucifixtion life, primarily based on the NT Book of Acts. Why this film has not been more popular is even more incredible. I am NOT a film buff and usually have little patience to get through a 90 min film but this six or nine hour saga (depending on whether you get the original or the expanded collector's edition) is well worth watching again and again. The film brought to life the Gospel message without preaching nor overly simple scripting. The script writing, acting and directing are all top quality. This film series should be watched, shared, pondered and rewatched as much as the Book itself. The Gospel message as presesnted in this film will speak to both evangelical, conservative and liberal Christians alike. It cuts right thru to the core and brings the resurrected Christ of the first century right into imminence. I trust that after watching this film you will read the Book with new eyes.",1006819200,7,959,4.748502994011976
