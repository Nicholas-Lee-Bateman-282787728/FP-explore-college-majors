8752250,5,B01C4U7X08,"The host got on my nerves in the first episode of ""Oh My God!"" when I was learning about ""Wicca"", but now he's grown on me and I see how fun and out going and open minded he is! EVERY episode in the series is SO INTERESTING! THIS is the way to show different religions in school social studies or any school class. It's shows an nonjudgmental fun host learning about each huge world religion in a respectful, very educational manner! I have enjoyed EVERY episode of ""Oh My God!"" and wish it were available in MORE outlets so the world can see. I don't judge Hindu's like I did or Muslims because I UNDERSTAND now and I respect other peoples loving peaceful way to love and worship God in THEIR WAY! They even found a Pentecostal Church that didn't want his wallet as soon as he walked in! Imagine THAT! I've learned so much from this AWESOME SERIES! WATCH ALL OF THEM!",1537315200,,868,4.331288343558282
8752251,4,B01C4U7X08,Nice simple intro gives a look inside the mosque  and intro prayer.,1497312000,,67,4.583333333333333
8752252,3,B01C4U7X08,"Something I noticed that the Muslim said that sounded ironic when he touched the rock and was explaining its significance. He said ""This is the closest you can get to heaven."" Uh...you got that right, especially if the bible is correct when it says in 1 John 2:22-23 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.",1496188800,,477,4.311111111111111
8752253,5,B01C4U7X08,"This was a great intro to Islam from a non-biased, non-political source. Very appropriate for high school students. Even my emotionally/behaviorally challenged students were fully engaged.  Tevya Heller is a very ""real"" person with an engaging, quirky personality that the students find cool enough to connect with. Best of all, he does NOT speak with a British accent so pervasive in documentaries these days (and boring to students)!  Obviously, this short video is not an all-inclusive, thorough look at Islam; hopefully, you are doing a more thorough job instructing on the 5 Pillars, history, art, etc. in the classroom. It does, though, give some great visuals and a bit of history, enough to give a taste of why Jerusalem is so important to Muslims. Another benefit of this video is that it does not get into conflicts, wars, jihad, terrorism, etc., which all paint a biased picture of Islam and paint all Muslims with the same negative brush.  If you want an in-depth video on any aspect of Islam, this isn't it, but if you want a brief introduction as a jumping off point, this is a good choice.",1491350400,,1104,4.830687830687831
8752254,5,B01C4U7X08,"Excellent first look at Islam for those who want to know about it. I've been a Muslim for 18 years and never saw the inside of the Dome of the Rock before, so this short video will be a good memory for me. I've seen several episodes in this serious, and can say Tevya Heller is very respectful of various faiths.",1491091200,,312,4.131147540983607

8752256,4,B01C4U7X08,"Nice short intro into Islam and the holy site of Jerusalem, since not much time allot of details not given and not much effort for complete information. For instance to prepare for prayer has a specific ritual washing bit more involved then was talked about.  Nor is much information given how Muslim prayers are performed,,  One last note follower of the religion of Islam is pronounced Moos-Lem",1484006400,,396,4.895522388059701
8752257,5,B01C4U7X08,The series is exactly what I need for my high school Religions class!,1469059200,,69,4.384615384615385
