8283101,4,B001BFH4KM,"The Beautiful South DVD collection of music videos - Carry On Up The Charts showcases the band's great sense of humor and really adds to the viewer's enjoyment of their music.  I was never a fan of the band in their heyday.  I only learned about The Beautiful South years later after seeing their hilarious video for You Keep It All In on VH1Classic (back in the early 2000s when they actually played videos).  Because of that one video, I have purchased this DVD, the identically titled Best Of CD, their debut CD, and all The Housemartins'(Paul Heaton's former band) CDs and DVD I could find.  See, MTV and VH1 executives, if you play videos I will buy product.  If all you show is reality programs I will ignore you.  Amazon.com delivered it in about 5 days to Hawaii and it was in perfect condition.",1313107200,,803,4.503448275862069
