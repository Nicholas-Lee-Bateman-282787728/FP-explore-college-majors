8274868,3,B0019NGE34,"I, in fact, DO like so-called ""gladiator movies,"" better known as 'muscleman movies' or, to the connoisseur (like myself), peplum - this despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of them are quite bad when judged by any kind of ""normal"" cinematic standards. But, then, ""normal"" standards aren't what we fans apply to these films. So there.

This particular example is especially odd, obscure and oftentimes more than a bit strange, in part because it wasn't actually intended to be a peplum at all, at least not initially. The film's original title was to have been ""Tarzan, il re della forza bruta,"" reflecting its genesis as an unauthorized Tarzan film. ""Oh, no ya don't!"" declared the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate, and so the Italian producers then relooped some of the dialogue and changed the name of the main character to Tor (Taur) to avoid an injunction

Despite these 'jungle book' origins, the film still has a lot of elements familiar to fans of the genre, like horsemen raiding a village and massacring the inhabitants; an evil queen (here portrayed by the astoundingly endowed Cuban beauty Bella Cortez) and a displaced good princess; lots of subterranean action; torture; and an apocalyptic/everything-is-caving-in climax.

But then there are the not-so-usual touches, one of the oddest of which is the main character's sidekick, Ubaratutu, played by Harry Baird as a sort of bodybuilder Stepin Fetchit. That definitely sounds more offensive than it should, but the fact is that the actor's voice has been looped, putting dialogue in his mouth that conforms in many uncomfortable ways to the stereotype of the panicky, superstitious black manservant - this despite Baird's impressive physique (or maybe because of it?). I'm not even going to speculate upon what the filmmakers' intentions were with this character, for fear of tarring the entire movie with that brush.

Like practically all pepla on video (and DVD, for that matter), the film was shot in an anamorphic widescreen process (Totalscope, in this case) and the print here is panned-&-scanned, which means that what you see on screen is just slightly more than half of the original image - regrettable and, at times, very frustrating, but also seemingly unavoidable, even in this day and age of remastered editions and deluxe boxed sets. Despite this drawback, the video is watchable, although that judgment may depend upon one's tolerance for such presentations.

For fans and completists of the genre, or for cinematic masochists who really don't know what's good for them. I guess I'm a little bit of both.",1265328000,,2589,5.111111111111111
