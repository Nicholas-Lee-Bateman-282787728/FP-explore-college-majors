4049231,5,B0031KC4ZA,"It is rare that I do an exercise DVD and run back to Amazon to review it immediately, but felt I had to share what I feel is the best DVD out there for intense cardio .  I have been searching for a really good cardio routine that does not include weights (I already have several weight training DVDs) and came across Cathe's HiiT.  I know a bit about Hiit and was trying to do interval training using my Garmin watch on my own, but when I found this DVD I knew it would be a good investment.  I was not wrong.  I started out with the 30/30 Intervals, which is easiest of the three on the DVD. But, by no means easy.  If anyone has done Jillian Michaels Banish Fat- this HiiT is that times 1000 as far as intensity, but is packed into a shorther amount of time.  The workout flew by and my shirt was drenched in sweat.  I would like to get to the point where I could do two of the workouts back to back but for now, just sticking with one at a time.

The only negatives I can think of:
1)I actually wish that the segments were just two or three exercises longer(I know crazy, right??)
2)Also-during the Pyramid Wave there is a funny ""type-O""-the segments show a preview on the bottom of the screen for the next exercise, instead of ""Mountain Climber"" on the bottom it says ""Moutain Climber"" just chuckled at that a bit-Didn't bother me or keep me from thinking this is one of the best DVD's ever.
3)This DVD is NOT for beginners, and there are hardly any modifications given, but as another reviewer said you can kind of make up your own, but I suppose it would be nice for beginners to have visual modification.
If you are really serious about losing weight and not wasting time with DVDs that do not push you out of your comfort zone, or if you hit a plateau, this DVD is your best choice.",1280448000,28,1790,4.198250728862973
4049232,5,B0031KC4ZA,"This DVD is part of Cathe's Shock Cardio Series.  It's the most intense of the series; it's also my favorite.  After being disappointed in some of the other workouts in the Shock Cardio series, I'm happy to say these workouts live up to the intensity and energy that I expect from Cathe.

I enjoyed all 3 workouts: the 40/20, the 30/30 and the Double Wave Pyramid. I think the Double Wave Pyramid is my favorite, since it doesn't use any equipment.

I'm an advanced exerciser, but I can no longer do a lot of high impact. Even with my low impact modifications, my heart rate was at the high end of my aerobic range for all workouts. Cathe doesn't give many modifications, but I was completely okay with that, I made up my own. For example, if she was doing a tuck jump, I would rise up on my toes and reach my hands towards the ceiling.

More specifics on what I loved:

**music was upbeat and peppy and this really helps me get through the workouts.
**Cathe is her energetic and encouraging self.
**cast members (Cedie, Brenda, Deazie and Lorraine) had good chemistry. I loved watching them high-five each other throughout the workout.
**workouts flew by! I was disappointed to have them end.
**30 minutes for each workout was perfect. I could really give it my all for the entire time.
**the timer at the bottom of the screen, showing length of interval and then length of rest.
**quick warm-up and adequate cool down. Unlike some of the other Shock Cardios, which seemed to me to have an endless warm-up (over 10 minutes) and no cool down, the timing of these was just right for me.

A minor thing (and it IS minor), the workout order on the DVD is: 40/20, 30/30 and Double Wave Pyramid. However, on the back of the DVD, the order is: 30/30, 40/20 and Double Wave Pyramid. The English major in me likes to have the descriptions consistent with the actual order. As I said, this is no big deal and certainly doesn't detract from the workouts.

So far, this is my favorite DVD of the Shock Cardio series. This is definitely for the advanced exerciser. An intermediate exerciser should be very familiar with lower impact modifications before attempting this workout.",1277424000,9,2166,4.578811369509044
4049233,5,B0031KC4ZA,"This is the 1st HiiT dvd ever! I love Cathe, she's fun and friendly. I use this DVD specially when I travel particularly the Double Wave Pyramid since you don't need any fitness equipment to do it. It is intense and since it is HiiT, you know you're still burning calories even when you're at rest or done with your workout and you're not catabolizing muscle.",1275782400,3,359,4.454545454545454
4049234,5,B0031KC4ZA,"Ouch! This one is tough but great, nonetheless. Production is superb, cueing is great as always and the workout is highly effective in just 30 minutes. I love it b/c I don't have a lot of time to workout with 2 toddlers and an infant but this makes me feel like I've squeezed an hour of working out into half the time. Great!",1268265600,7,325,4.174603174603175
4049235,5,B0031KC4ZA,I have been waiting for Cathe to come out with a HiiT workout and this doesn't disappoint!  This video is perfect for the days when you don't have an hour but still want a killer workout.,1268006400,6,187,4.194444444444445
4049236,5,B0031KC4ZA,"Cathe F. is one of my favorite video instructors, and these three HIIT workouts are among the hardest workouts she has put out.  HIIT workouts are designed to give you an amazing cardio workout, without catabolizing (eating away) your muscle.  Don't let the shortness of these HIIT workouts (or of any HIIT workouts) fool you:  these are VERY tough!

According to Cathe's website, the 30/30 workout (30 seconds of work, 30 seconds of rest) is the easiest, the Double Wave Pyramid (interval lengths build up in time, and then build back down) is the middle one, and the 40/20 (40 seconds of work, 20 seconds of rest) workout is the hardest.  I definitely agree!  While the 30/30 and Double Pyramid weren't crazy, I thought I was going to die when I did the 40/20 workout for the first time!

Two of the three workouts on this disk also require a step bench, along with extra risers (for a total of four on each side).  While you can probably modify the workout if you don't have a step bench, you'll definitely get more out of the workouts if you have a step.

I have a tendency towards tendonitis in one of my knees, and, so far, these workouts have not aggravated it.  If you have bad knees, though, you might want to preview the workouts on-line since they do require a lot of plyometric jumping.

Another nice feature is that there is a countdown clock for each workout, so you know exactly how much time is left in each work and rest segment.  Somehow, it makes it more bearable if you know how many seconds are left in the work sections!  Each workout comes in at just under 30 minutes, including a warm-up and cool down stretch.

In my opinion, these are the hardest workouts in Cathe's new STS Cardio series.  They are GREAT!",1264896000,46,1732,4.4888178913738015
4049237,5,B0031KC4ZA,"HIIT workouts are the new thing for serious exercisers. I like that it's 3 workouts short, but still feels like a real workout even individually. I'm trying to lose weight, so I like to add this in in the evening for a second workout (1-2 sections). I feel that this type of workout is effective, and I will continue to use it as part of my home workout rotation.",1263254400,5,363,4.27536231884058
4049238,2,B0031KC4ZA,"I really want to like this video, but her cuing is nearly impossible to hear or follow, and there's no demonstration of what the move she's cuing for is going to be. If she would just go through a slowed-down version of the upcoming move during the rest segment, that would do wonders. I could keep up with it if I just knew what the hell the move was going to be. Also, it would be helpful if she had a personality. She does absolutely nothing to make this DVD one bit of fun.",1392595200,5,477,4.085106382978723
4049239,5,B0031KC4ZA,"I enjoy all of Cathe's DVDs. I I look forward to all of her DVDs. They keep me challenged, but not too much!",1387238400,,108,3.739130434782609
4049240,5,B0031KC4ZA,This is the only DVD (I have many) that makes me sweat and I lost a dress size in 2 weeks.  It is not boring doing it day after day.  Best workout ever!  I highly recommend it.,1378252800,3,176,3.7027027027027026
4049241,1,B0031KC4ZA,I have Cathe's muscle max and do other Hiit dvds so I bought this one. My knees have always had issues but not since I have been more fit. I work out 6x per week. I run 3 days and hiit cardio 3 days. I did this today and I am really  upset my knees hurt really bad and its just way too much jumping on that step. I am a little discouraged she leans so much on this step when there are SO MANY other exercises you can do without that step and just with body weight or dumbells. This is super high intensity. It is made for a 15 year old. That is all. I am upset I bought it.,1377043200,6,573,3.69672131147541
4049242,5,B0031KC4ZA,"These are some of the best cardio workouts out there, in my opinion. This is an excellent DVD. It has three thirty minute workouts - all HIIT style. Each one of them leaves me absolutely breathless. They really get the heart rate up and burn tons of calories. I also love the fact that one of them doesn't use any equipment, making it an excellent cardio workout while on the road traveling or on days when you just don't want to drag out all the equipment. These are fantastic cardio workouts that really showcase Cathe at her best!",1371081600,2,533,4.448979591836735
4049243,5,B0031KC4ZA,"This is no joke, if you want a short workout that works, this is it. I did p90x and this is more intense than the psychometric video because the breaks in between sets are shorter. I do this without the step so if you don't have one its ok, just modify it.",1365552000,4,256,3.9423076923076925
4049244,5,B0031KC4ZA,"Great, Great, Great!!!  Haven't used all the training segments but certainly love the ones I have tried thus far.  Great work out, definitely kept me moving and can feel the results.  Highly recommend her products.",1363305600,,214,5.057142857142857
4049245,4,B0031KC4ZA,"I am a huge Cathe fan...have been for years and I own many of her dvds/products.  Let me say that I only gave this 4 stars, not 5 because it's so difficult and I miss her variety of other exercises.  Yes, it describes it on the back but still, I do miss the variations with her other dvds...like weights, step and even ab work.  There are 3 different workouts (2 use a step) and the music is pretty good.  I'm an advanced excerciser and after one of these I'm pouring with sweat and I can 'feel' it the next day!  Definitely not something to do multiple days in a row...your body will need to get a break from the tough plyometrics!",1360195200,2,632,4.190082644628099
4049246,5,B0031KC4ZA,I bought this to change up my cardio routine every once in a while and that it does. I do have to stop and catch my breath but hopefully when I get used to it I will be able to do it all the way though with no stopping.,1357603200,,219,3.489795918367347
4049247,4,B0031KC4ZA,"I enjoyed this workout but needed to do two sections to get the type of workout I need as an advanced excerciser

4049248,3,B0031KC4ZA,"Its a good dvd but everything is centered around her aerobic stepper - which is quite expensive. Just buy INSANITY, you'll get more out of it.",1351036800,4,142,4.5
4049249,5,B0031KC4ZA,"I have never seen a Cathe workout before. I decided to get this workout after seeing her mentioned in reviews of some of my other favorite workout DVDs like Amy Dixon breathless body and Jari Love extreme series. I really love this HiiT workout from Cathe. She is an excellent instructor with great energy. I am going to be looking at what other DVDs she has out.

The workouts move fast so you never have time to think about how much longer you have. I like to workout longer than 30 minutes so I have been doing the Pyramid workout followed by the 30/30. It is still shorter than an  hour workout but by the end I feel that I have worked harder than many of my longer but less intense workouts. I need to get additional step risers before I try the 40/20 but it looks great. The only negative I have is the step warmups. I like the high energy and that they start you right off with getting the heart rate up. However, they are a little complicated and I have not learned the warmup routine yet so I fall behind and don't get the moves totally right. Overall, I highly recommend this workout!",1347408000,2,1094,4.280193236714976
4049250,5,B0031KC4ZA,"I love this DVD. I was hesitant to buy it, because it's a little pricier than most. However, it's very effective. Three workouts that are 30 minutes long and you will really feel like you got a great workout in. I wanted a workout that I could do quickly and still get fit and this is it.",1341360000,,288,4.0701754385964914
4049251,2,B0031KC4ZA,"I'm an avid exerciser and don't dread getting into my workout clothes to sweat.  This workout is too intense for this 51 year old female.  There is no way to keep your heart rate in the fat burning zone.  I had to stop halfway during each segment to let my heart rate come down.  Also, I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get my belly flat.  As I found out, too much cortisol is released during this workout.  Once I switched to Beachbody workouts, I was able to keep my heart rate in my target zone and the belly fat is gone and I'm starting to see muscle definition.  I never got this with Cathe workouts.  I don't recommend them.",1341360000,5,633,4.216666666666667

4049253,2,B0031KC4ZA,"I've been doing Jillian Michaels' 30 minute workouts and recently tried this one.  I've not even been able to make it through the first (and easiest) of the workouts and feel completely discouraged.  This workout is MUCH harder and is filled with repetitive jumping.  Other than for the intro, which in my opinion is the most enjoyable segment, the step I purchased is not even required for the 30/30 workout. I don't know how the other reviewers can claim the 30 minutes flew by.  For me, it was the longest 30 minutes of my life.  Not only is the difficulty level very high, but the moves are repetitive and boring.  Jump and squat to the left for 30 seconds followed by jump and squat to the right for 30 seconds etc....YIKES.  I'll stick with Jillian.",1331856000,7,755,4.548148148148148
4049254,5,B0031KC4ZA,"Aside from Cathe's new Afterburn, I think these HIIT workouts are my favorite.  My husband and I have gotten into doing more HIIT workouts and for good reason.  Some of the research I've found says that doing 2 1/2 hours of HIIT is equivalent to about 10 hours of moderate sustained cardio.  Both my husband and I have noticed a higher endurance level for other workouts after doing HIIT on a regular basis.  Anyone who works out is most likely familiar with Cathe's workouts, so I don't need to say much except she's one of the best in the business--great cuing, great personality, exceptional workouts!  We love this DVD and use it regularly in our rotations.  You won't be disappointed if you buy!!",1330473600,,701,4.658536585365853
4049255,5,B0031KC4ZA,This is a great video.  Holy workout!  Perfect for days when you need to burn some serious calories in a short amount of time.  Cathe is such a professional and has yet again put together a wonderful program.  This is not for the faint of heart.  This is for the real athletes!,1326931200,,277,4.25
4049256,5,B0031KC4ZA,"Like another reviewer said, it's tough to get a good workout from an at-home DVD...until you do Cathe's HiiT! I was completely out of breath and had to give myself a few seconds rest during many of the exercises. All of the workouts are 30 min - short & sweet - but they burn tons of calories. I did the 40/20 yesterday, and I'm sore in my legs today. Highly recommended!",1325980800,,371,4.23943661971831
4049257,5,B0031KC4ZA,"If you are short on time and need a workout for maximum effort and calorie burn then this one is for you. 3 different plyometric workouts, with varying levels of intensity and breaks.

4049258,5,B0031KC4ZA,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.

Another great workout from this instructor.  As usual, low key, minimal chit chat, decent cuing, music, camera work. Backup ""dancers"" non-annoying (her usual crew.)

Really tough but in a good way --- gives me something to work toward.  There are a lot of jump up with both feet moves and I substitute some kind of modified jump up one-foot-then-the-other since missing and tripping due to fatigue would be too nasty to contemplate.  As long as my heart rate stays up there it's all good.

Love the 40/20 and 30/30 format.  I am hoping there will be more workouts following this format.",1316995200,2,651,4.863636363636363

I love it because the workouts are only 30 minutes, but you feel like you exercised for hours!  Some Cathe workouts are hard to follow and tricky with the steps, but these moves are simple to follow just hard to execute.

4049262,5,B0031KC4ZA,"Although this is not my first Amazon purchase, it is my first Review. I'm 34 and I've been working out to videos such as Karen Voight's Step back in the mid '90's, Tae Bo since 1998,  and Jillian Michaels the past few months (NMTZ and 30 Day Shred). While I've done Cathe workouts on FitTV, this is my first video purchase. I consider myself intermediate/advanced since I can handle Tae Bo chased with Level 3 of Shred and still have energy. I don't want to spend over $100 for Intensity but wanted something similar. Not dancey, but hard-core.

HiiT is made up of 3 segments, each lasting 30 minutes or less, with a great warm-up, the actual workout, then a very nice cool down. I love the 30 second clock counting down which motivates me to finish each workout - just a few more seconds of the grueling plyo jacks!

Cathe's HiiT blows all the previous workouts to oblivion. Jillian's Level 3 of 30 Day Shred is merely a warm up to the 30/30 segment of Cathe's HiiT. This segment, while just under 30 minutes, is extremely challenging and had me reaching exhaustion about halfway - I couldn't believe it!

One thing I Detest is when the trainer stops to show you all the modifications (big Jillian problem) -- I can see for myself, thank you -- Cathe never stops. She's right there with you doing every movement top to bottom.

I couldn't tell from previous reviews if HiiT had a lot of plyo, which works great for me - love them - and the answer, happily, is Yes! I breathe faster and deeper than I ever have, and I Feel like I got the best workout, that I couldn't have done more. And unlike other workouts, I don't have any more in me to pop another DVD and go for another 30 minutes. That's what I wanted and that's what I'm getting!

I'm at my goal weight so I'm just looking for definition, but if what you want is to lose weight this DVD will get you there in no time. I burned over 300 cal (5'4, 126lbs) with the 30/30 and with the intense plyo your body will continue to burn calories long after you wipe the pouring sweat off your face.

The best workout DVD I've purchased, no question. Can't wait to sweat and cry out in pain again tomorrow morning!",1304294400,15,2162,4.336633663366337
4049263,5,B0031KC4ZA,"I received this DVD last week but was too much of a wimp to attempt it until today.  I loved it!  I felt like I was back on the playground in the springtime when I was ten years old.  I could do most of the moves and only stopped to catch my breath for a few seconds, once or twice.  My only question is: does it work?  Has anyone done this workout consistently and achieved results ... and if so, how often during the week do you do this one?",1303084800,,443,3.8777777777777778

This workout is harder than any Jillian workout I've done.  I tracked my calorie burn via a heart rate monitor and during Jillian's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism I burned 300 calories and that workout is 1 hour.  During the Double Wave Pyramid on Cathe's video, I burned 200 calories and that was exactly 30 minutes with warm up and cool down. I did the 40/20 workout today and did not track calories, but I'm almost positive I burned more than 200, as this workout seemed harder to me.

I'd read the reviews (hence the purchase!) but still thought it wasn't going to be *too* hard.  Who was I kidding?  It kicked my butt!  The first few rounds of the 40/20 workout are easy enough to follow but really get the heart rate going.  Near the end I was definitely modifying the moves.

4049266,5,B0031KC4ZA,"Wow, this workout is no joke.  The first time I tried the 30/30 I had to pause it for a few extra seconds in between the exercises to keep my passing out!  What the heck?  I am in good shape... or so I thought.  I haven't done much HIIT workouts though.  I used to try it with running.  I'd do about 1 minute of running full blast and then 1 minute of rest (walking).  But this is far more intense.  My heart rate was through the roof.  Cathe is a good instructor who gives good explanations without talking too much.  She is also a freckin beast!  She hardly ever seems out of breath.  The pyramid starts with 20 seconds of exercise, then 20 seconds of rest.  It adds 5 seconds to each until you get up to 40.  Then you work your way back down.  They you get a one minute rest and do it all over again.  Then there is the 40/20 which is definetely only for people in amazing cardiovascular shape!  My hat goes off to you if you can get through it without taking additional breaks.  As another reviewer mentioned, this one requires changing out your risers in your step throughout.  The 30/30 keeps the step at the same height.  The pyramid doesn't require the step.  I like that.  I am not the biggest fan of using my step.  I understand it adds intensity to workouts, but I find myself getting quite clumsy over it.  I got confused with the foot work of the warm up for the 30/30 because it's all off the step. I just make sure even if I'm not getting every step right,I'm moving enough to get myself warmed up.

This is a great, compact workout that I would recconmend to anyone trying to lose weight or just get in better cardiovascular health.  Combine this with some weight training, and you should be dropping pounds in no time!  Good luck!",1283472000,12,1747,4.2629969418960245
