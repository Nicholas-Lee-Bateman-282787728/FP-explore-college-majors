7841463,5,6303198104,"I consider this to be one of L&H's funniest films. Liberty and most other L&H short films are easily worth buying at the same price you would normally pay for a full-length film, because there are more laughs in 20 minutes than there are in most full-length comedies.

The plot has L&H escaping from prison, and they quickly change out of their striped prison uniforms and into their regular clothes while being chased by police. In their haste, each one accidentally puts on the other's pants. They look for a place to change their pants, while inadvertently being caught repeatedly with their pants down in public places.

One of several places they duck into to change is the elevator to a building under construction, where Stan accidentally hits the lever, bringing them up to the top floor.

There are very few comedy films of any era that can compare to those of Laurel and Hardy, and this is one of their best.",1302912000,2,918,4.654320987654321
7841464,5,6303198104,"Along with ""Battle of the Century"" and ""Big Business,"" LIBERTY is one of the best Laurel & Hardy silent shorts.

The boys are escaped convicts who change into street clothes in the getaway car and accidentally end up wearing each other's pants. They try to exchange trousers in public but are constantly being seen. For some privacy while disrobing, the two enter an elevator that takes them to the top of an office building under construction. Some very funny 'I' beam sight gags follow.

L&H's last silent short may be their best-ever comedy. Here they engage in a battle of escalation with Jimmy Fnlayson, an angry homeowner who doesn't want to buy a Christmas tree from them. Tape also includes 1929's THEY GO BOOM.

(8.0) Liberty (1929) - Stan Laurel/Oliver Hardy/Sam Lufkin/James Finlayson/Jack Hill/Harry Bernard/Jean Harlow/Ed Brandenburg

TRIVIANA--

""Liberty"" is a transition film-- it was originally issued as a silent comedy or in a music and sound effect version for theaters that had converted to sound.

Watch for Jean Harlow's cameo in the cab scene.

Written and directed by Leo McCarey, one of the greatest comedy filmmakers of all time.

While demonstrating for Stan the safety of the girder set, Oliver Hardy crashed through a wooden platform beneath camera range and landed in a net 20 feet under it.",1223596800,2,1599,5.520491803278689
