2421877,3,B000BKDO5C,"supership the yamato was,unfortunately i cannot say the same about this dvd.it had hardly any underwater film of the wreck,which i expected,but all you see is a minisub measuring the chrysanthemum crest on the great ships bow to authenticate the wreck; and they got that wrong too,the crest was/is 1.2 meters in dia,not 2 meters! a real dissapointment.",1293148800,6,352,5.086206896551724
2421878,1,B000BKDO5C,"Very disappointing!! Offered no new information. Instead, basically retold the history of the Pacific war. Apart for a few minutes of sketchy underwater footage and stock pictures of the Yamato itself (that we've all seen before) this DVD offers nothing knew to the Yamato enthusiast!",1290816000,12,284,5.333333333333333
2421879,5,B000BKDO5C,"I bought this along with the Japanese movie ""Yamato"", aka ""Men of the Yamato"". Nova uses a few scenes from the Japanese movie, but tells the story of the ship's service, sinking and discovery much better.",1280880000,,204,4.694444444444445
2421880,3,B000BKDO5C,"This documentary is somewhat disappointing, if only because it really says nothing new about the sinking of the Yamato. The surviving crew interviews were interesting and did much to help capture the mindset and atmosphere before the final voyage (a decent tribute to the sad waste of a brave crew and a fine ship), but the ""aura"" that the documentary creates around the ship is somewhat misleading and overblown.  It is almost as if the circumstances of the sinking were unique to the ship...sorry, but they're not.  The documentary even admits that other battleships were sunk or damaged by aircraft.

What is most perplexing in that vein is that there is NO mention of the Yamato's sister ship, Musashi...perhaps because it was sunk under almost under identical circumstances (overwhelmed by US carrier aircraft) a year eariler.  Mentioning that fact would have seriously undercut the ""how could the Yamato have been sunk so easily"" theme of this documentary.

BTW, if you want to see what happens when shells and powder collide in a capsizing battleship, check out the sinking of the HMS Barham on YouTube.",1247270400,,1110,5.010869565217392
2421881,1,B000BKDO5C,"Start out with Amazon's description of the DVD; ""This was the firts battle the Yamato was in"". Nonsense- how about Leyte Gulf? How about the number of sorties that it led all over the Pacific?
The fact is that the Yamato was a tremendous threat to US forces, I probably sunk at least 1 ""Jeep"" carrier in Leyte Gulf, and was only able to run away from a confrontation with the Iowa and NJ off of the Phillipines because the US Battleships were running on one boilder in order to save fuel. What a gigantic disappointment this DVD is, plain lousy.",1244505600,2,545,4.405940594059406

What struck me most was the background story of Japan's desperate position(militarily and economically)at this juncture in the Pacific War. I recommend it highly.",1212969600,,435,8.478260869565217
2421883,5,B000BKDO5C,"The Yamato, the largest battleship ever built. Its demise during WWII is a fascinating tale of tech, engineering hubris, and the samurai code.",1129248000,4,142,5.217391304347826

8087953,5,B000BKDO5C,Interesting film,1425600000,,16,7.5
8087954,5,B000BKDO5C,Interesting documentary about this amazing ship.,1417910400,,48,7.166666666666667
8087955,3,B000BKDO5C,A decent history on the ship but the documentary doesn't give you anything on the actual facts of the ship or its weaponry. It mentions 18 inch guns only once and never mentions the ship size or displacement. I enjoyed it but there are probably better programs.,1415059200,3,261,4.574468085106383
8087956,3,B000BKDO5C,Not as complete as I wished..There was a lot more history connected with the ship that was not mentioned in the presentation,1380672000,2,124,4.681818181818182
8087957,5,B000BKDO5C,This battleship I had no idea existed until learning of this DVD. I was highly interested and found it moving that the ship was basically not even used for its potential. But that is a good thing! .... Corey,1368057600,,207,4.333333333333333
8087958,4,B000BKDO5C,"There is always a problem talking about the Yamato and it's cultural mystique that leads to not discussing the sister ship Mushashi and the ""half sister"" ship Shinano converted to a carrier.  The same problem occurs when the German Bismark is discussed without mentioning the sister ship Tirpitz.

The circumstances regarding production of the film steered the material to involve more emotional content, but Nova is a science program after all, and other reviewers critiques are justified.  The essentials are there, but they take a bit of a back seat.",1364083200,5,553,5.122222222222222
8087959,4,B000BKDO5C,The show is only 50 minutes but it does go into nice detail the process of developing the ship and why it saw only limited action in the war. The finding of the Yamato is brief but informative. A longer show would have been better but is still highly recommended viewing. A must keep for the video library of any Yamato enthusiast.,1353801600,,331,4.354838709677419
