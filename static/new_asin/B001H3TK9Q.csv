8317334,1,B001H3TK9Q,"This is the second time I buy a Mexican miniseries. The first one did not include the ending.
This one has every disk labeled El Vuelo del Aguila. But what is recorded on the disks is ""La Antorcha Encendida"". A whole different story. Right label, wrong movie/series. And the ending is missing as well. Beware of ""Made in Mexico"". They just can't get their act together.",1355356800,,369,4.606060606060606
8317335,5,B001H3TK9Q,"This Telenovela was on high definition, I can't believe how clear it looks and an great Mexican  history  and this Novela keeps you addicted  to want to watch it all in 1 day... Really good",1344816000,2,189,4.3428571428571425
8317336,5,B001H3TK9Q,"I have never been a big fan of Porfirio Diaz, rather disliked him, and still do. But this telenovela is about far more than Porfirio. Given that Diaz was born shortly after Mexico gained its independence from Spain, the series covers almost the entire century between independence and the Revolution. Acting is very good, production values are high, and this really is an exciting period in Mexican history. Features a lot of well known Mexican actors that you will recognize from other telenovelas and cinema. The story is very engaging, and I often found myself staying up way later than I had planned to watch ""just one more episode."" And yes, I did find that  Porfirio Diaz was a somewhat more likeable person than I had before, and I ended up really caring about the character (who is played by several different actors at the various stages of his life). This series is absolutely worth buying!",1330646400,4,900,4.769230769230769
8317337,5,B001H3TK9Q,"This is a must see if you are interested at all in Mexican History.  During the Presidency of Benito Juarez, another young Zapotec indian made his way up via his military prowess.  The beginning of this story starts with Porfirio's Birth.  A very well told story of the Porfiriato era with a fabulous cast. Humberto Zurita, Manuel Ojeda, Jaqueline Andere, Laura Flores (singer/actress).  Mario Ivan Martinez as Maximillian was a good cast, he was also in ""Como Agua Para Chocolate"".  The key players in Cinco the Mayo and the Mexican Revoulution are all here plus more.  Don't forget that during this period with the French occupation of Mexico, Juarez was still president and ran the country from a stagecoach hiding from the French troops who were always on his trail.
I have been interested in purchasing this telenovela since I saw some of it and missed a few episodes.  It also did not hurt that the original purchase prices as $60.00 and by applying for an Amazon Visa, the offer was for a $30.00 discount on the first bill.  I just received it and saw my credit.",1261958400,12,1069,4.679144385026738
