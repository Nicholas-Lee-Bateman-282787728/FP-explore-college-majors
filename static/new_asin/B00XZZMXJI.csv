Often the last few episodes of a series can make or break a series and for me the last few episodes ruined it!

Hamatora was like a really good meal. But then, toward the end, you end up getting food poisoning and end up spending half the night puking your guts out, and the other half with never ending diarrhea. Yeah, not a good experience! And definitely not one that you're eager to repeat. Or recommend to others...",1488758400,,515,4.354166666666667
8717219,3,B00XZZMXJI,"It was kinda boring in my opinion, but what made me keep watching was the opening and the animation. The story is pretty cool with dectives with super powers, the end leaves you with a cliffhanger. Id say stream it.",1450742400,,215,4.4
