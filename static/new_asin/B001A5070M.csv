3445623,1,B001A5070M,I cant believe they even  made this ridiculous movie. It looks like they made it with a home camera. The acting is amateurish and the story is just plain silly. I doubt this movie sells too much.,1264809600,,195,4.27027027027027
3445624,3,B001A5070M,"If there isn't one already, then soon there will probably be a pop culture thesis or dissertation to explain or at least examine the explosion of Zombie films in the last decade.  The best of these movies are often thinly veiled commentary on our society - but our insatiable appetite for them is a reflection on ourselves also.  It would be interesting to know what compels society to produce and support Zombie flicks (and books, and comics, and video games, etc, etc.).  I suspect it isn't an entirely healthy attraction.

Regardless, since the industry is still churning them out, the market must be unsaturated, though filmmakers are stretching the genre's boundaries to the breaking point.  Hence 'American Zombie', an addition to the fold done in the 'mockumentary' style (which is itself beginning to wear thin).  Here we have a group of filmmakers who are prepared to document the 'lives' of Los Angeles' undead community.  Within the framework of the film, this community is a disenfranchised, exploited minority, although they can and do mix with the humans around them.  It's quickly apparent that one of the people involved in making the film is expressly interested in exposing zombie habits that make this arrangement untenable, and one of the more dry elements of the film is that the others act as if he's showing bad form.

The filmmakers follow four 'revenants'; a slacker teen/early twenties convenience store clerk, an activist for zombie awareness and civil rights, a thirtysomething organic food distributor in denial about her undead status, and a mousy artist full of suppressed anger.  The crew follows these four about in typical documentary style, shooting raw footage and cutting away to interviews to fill in the gaps that explain this alternate reality.  Meanwhile, the co-directors argue between themselves about the direction filming should take.  The footage culminates in the film crew receiving permission to attend 'Live Dead', a undead festival where humans are strictly forbidden.  Things start to go poorly for the crew at this point, and in the wrap-up footage, we learn once again why zombies don't make good friends.

The problem with 'American Zombie', as I see it, is that to do a 'mockumentary', you must have a target to mock.  This film could have been a piercing unveiling of the pretensions in mockumentary filmmaking itself.  Or it could have aimed at fans of the zombie genre in general.  Instead, it takes pot shots at whatever is handy - slackers, repressed individuals, loneliness, race relations and civil rights activists, music and arts festivals - and fails to focus on anything specific.  As a commentary on modern life, its conclusions are banal; as comedy it's too obvious, and as horror, except for one genuine creepy moment that I won't go into for sake of spoilers, it doesn't even make an attempt.  On the plus side, the production value is pretty good - this film probably didn't cost a lot to make, but they've disguised that well and turned in a professional effort.  The actors, all unknowns to me, do an excellent job, and though supposedly a comedy, the film stays seriously dedicated, never descending into slapstick or cheap gags.

None of that outweighs the drag of unfocused satire.  All in all, an average film, probably best reserved for the ardent zombie junkie, and not for the common horror fan.",1260921600,,3376,5.001788908765653
3445625,3,B001A5070M,"American Zombie (Grace Lee, 2007)

Grace Lee (The Grace Lee Project) directs this mockumentary set in an alternate Los Angeles where the living dead are peacefully coexisting with humans. Lee, playing an investigative journalist (named Grace Lee, natch), teams up with partner John Solomon to get the inside scoop on what the zombies really think. ""Behind-the-scenes"" footage shows us conflict developing between Lee, who's interested in doing the altruist everyone-get-along thing, while Solomon is looking for ways to exploit the situation. All well and good, and it goes along just like any other documentary, except that the further the two dig, the more they realize that there's something going on under the surface.

That's where this goes wrong. When it's just trying to be a straight mockumentary, it goes along like gangbusters, exploring all the things you expect a movie like this to explore in clever, subtle ways. And then comes the whole thriller subplot, which is ham-handed and inane. Still, there's a lot of fun to be had with the mockumentary bits, and it's worth checking out for the first half. ** ",1245974400,,1119,5.103825136612022
3445626,3,B001A5070M,"I think the number of people that fall into the target audience for this film is really, really small.

First off, let me say that it is a very well made film, a very slick production that captures the feel of a documentary exceptionally well (as I suppose it should, since Grace Lee apparently makes documentaries).  I also think the concept of the film is very clever (that zombies live among us, but they're just another misunderstood and downtrodden subclass...or are they?).

Having said that, it's kind of an odd mix of styles and I'm not sure who will ultimately enjoy the film.  I'm not sure how many people who are attracted to the zombie film genre will also be interested in a film which is at its heart a media and identity politics satire.  And I'm not sure how many people looking for a media satire will be interested in the zombie subject matter.

I see there is a bit of a debate raging as to what this film actually is:  mockumentary, faux documentary, horror movie, etc.  I don't really know what the difference between a mockumentary and a faux documentary is.  If the difference is that mockumentaries are comedies and faux documentaries are not necessarily comedies, I have to say I think this is intended to be primarily a comedy (or at least, as I said, satire...and my understanding of satire is that it's generally intended to be funny).  True, it's a relatively dark and low key comedy, but still a comedy.

Part of the film's problem may be how it is promoted (to the limited extent that it has been promoted); the Netflix capsule review of American Zombie opens:  ""Part mockumentary, part unabashed gore-fest...""

Well, we can argue about whether or not it's a mockumentary, and it's a matter of personal experience whether it's scary or not, but I don't think anyone could honestly describe this film as ""part unabashed gore-fest.""  So to the extent that that tag would draw the core audience for more typical zombie movies, I think those people will be disappointed.

On the whole, I found it worth watching for its novelty, and I think the film makers hit exactly what they were trying to hit (I'm just not sure how many people are out there waiting for a film to hit that).

My favorite moment:  John keeps insisting that the film explore whether or not zombies are eating human flesh.  Grace, in irritation, lashes out with the question:  ""Why do you insist on essentializing zombies to their biological functions?""

If you don't think that's funny, don't get this movie.",1238025600,5,2505,4.688787185354691
3445627,5,B001A5070M,"An excellent, intellectually stimulating film, much needed in a sub genre full of dross. It engages on many levels and you can really get into the people they meet, they are very interesting.

This is a film that starts light and fluffy, even funny and amusing in places then by the end is deadly serious, those sweet friendly zombies are suddenly clearly as sweet and friendly as a rabid rottweiler. It scared the pants off me and made me worried about the topic - one that doesn't even exist!! Excellent effort. Especially the closing scene.

The one star review here on the page by another reviewer is undeserved. Mockumentaries are not always comedies and don't have to be comedies. They can be comedirs (e.g. Spinal Tap and the other reviewer mentions Zelig) but they can also be deadly serious. There are many serious examples (like the recent post apocalyptic one set in San Francisco-  ""Ever Since the World Ended"").",1227830400,2,924,4.79874213836478
3445628,4,B001A5070M,"At this point as a society, we've coupled zombies and comedy.  I'm sure there are a myriad of compelling psychological reasons why this is so.  But whatever our complex need to attach comedic value to something as existentially horrifying as reanimated corpses, it manifests itself in an equally complex milieu.  The zombie/comedy dyad operates within a very wide spectrum.  Zombie movies can be hilariously funny, a la Sean of the Dead, or stark and terrifying, as in the original Night of the Living Dead (which uses only a sprinkling of comedy to balance the effect).

I think the other reviewers may have expected this movie to be a lot more screwball than it was.  The fact that it wasn't doesn't constitute a failure.  The slapstick zombie movie is only one type of a surprisingly complex subgenre of cinema.  And this ain't it.

American Zombie asks viewers to suspend disbelief to its very limits, and assume that zombies are both real and that they are deserving of deeper consideration.  For anyone who ever spent more than an hour in discussion of zombie physiology, cause, and social consequence, this movie is like candy.

The movie (which is conducted like a documentary) follows four ""high-functioning"" zombies living (also dating, consuming, and working) among regular humans in Los Angeles.  Each subject has his or her own take on his unique ""condition.""

 The general feeling of the film is the same as that of a documentary following people diagnosed with an untreatable medical condition.  Ivan begins with the statement (paraphrased), ""I don't know how long it will be before my body decomposes, so I'm living each day at a time.""  A second character, Lisa, is first seen wandering (a little plaintively) in a cemetery, admiring funerary bouquets and wondering if she'll ever know who she was in life.

The film plunges into the cause of zombiism: namely that some people carry an inert virus in the brain that isn't activated until the host is the victim of violent death.  American Zombie then quickly investigates other compelling ideas like the implication of being an adult with essentially no identity and how the families respond to a loved one who was first a victim then a reanimated corpse with no memory of their past.

The film also investigates how the civil infrastructure manages a zombie population existing in tandem with the human population, from city government census agencies to a not-for-profit advocacy group working to avoid sweatshop-type exploitation of zombie workers.

There are a number of secondary themes, from zombie sexuality to zombie art.  The effect is of a fully fleshed out scenario that lacks the gaping continuity holes that characterize 95% of zombie films.  It gives the considerate viewer ample material to chew over and provides plenty of meat for discussion (pardon the necrophagy pun).  Which, for an audience who groans at every inconsistency and implausibility that plague the genre, proffers a film that addresses our core hunger for a socially responsible zombie movie.

Finally, the film also follows the ""filmmakers'"" creative and production process.  This is actually a little annoying for the first half of the film, and feels a little Lisa Ling (National Geographic)-ish.  However, when the filmmakers disprove their own thesis statement, and find that their subjects are not the same as a cancer patient and cannot simply assimilate into the human population, the coverage of the filmmakers takes on a much more urgent life.

The climax of the film is a complete shock, which alone is rare in a well canvassed subgenre of cinema such as zombie movies.  I won't ruin it.  So I will conclude by saying American Zombie is as much unlike a George Romero or Sean of the Dead movie as one can get and has what it takes to delight and surprise veteran zombie aficionados.  More casual audiences might lament it's lack of visual one-liners and lack of back to back gore scenes.  But fans of the genre should seek this one out, as it's an infrequent example of a film doing something different with the zombie theme.  It's a welcome addition to the canon.",1223251200,8,4125,4.95924308588064
3445629,5,B001A5070M,"I do think it works as a funny mockumentary.  I laughed out loud many times, more than I can say for many recent comedies.  I thought it was a fresh idea and I liked the characters.  The final scenes actually did have ""horror"" in it, as well.",1218067200,2,242,4.1063829787234045
3445630,1,B001A5070M,"This is a mockumentary about four zombies living in Los Angeles trying to be accepted by the living society.

But it is a complete and absolute failure. Here's why: it is not funny.

Not that the concept/premise behind it is not funny in itself. IT IS BRILLIANT! But the problem is that the filmmakers are so aware of the brilliance of their concept/premise that they thought that the simple contrast between the candidness of zombies who look like people AND the fact that they ARE zombies would be hilarious. It is not.

Therefore, the fatal flaw here is that the film adheres so much to the documental construction of a serious reality (to be documented) that it COMPLETELY MISSES THE FACT THAT IT IS A MOCKUMENTARY IN FIRST PLACE... MISSING THE FACT THAT IT HAS TO BE FUNNY.

Woody Allen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zelig/dp/B00005O06N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zelig</a>&nbsp;is example of a perfect mockumentary. It constructs a unique character and places him in a real context. We know it is not real because the character is an obvious fantasy (the MOCK part of mockumentary) but it is so beautifully and credibly interwoven with the real context that it really looks real (the docUMENTARY part of mockumentary).

The success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zelig/dp/B00005O06N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zelig</a>&nbsp;comes from this: the more Woody Allen stretches the absurdity and comedy, the more he keeps the documentary form austere. The result? Contrast. The effect of the contrast? Sheer laughter.

In American Zombie, though, there's no comedy. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zelig/dp/B00005O06N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zelig</a>, concept, premise, character AND situations were funny. Here it's just the concept. The zombies are just another group of sad people, losers or, ultimately, just people.

And all of this because the filmmakers ALSO do not know to which audience they are working. Is it for the documentary crowd (who does not care about zombies at all) or is it for the zombie crowd (who won't buy zombies that look 99% like sad people)?

So this film is a disaster: unfunny, uninteresting, talky and boring.

And even if the desired effect were ""keep it low"" in order to scare people in the end (abandoning the ""mock"" and going for a even more sophisticated  mixture between horror and documentary) it is also a failure because it is not scary at all.

Sadly enough, everything on this film so miscalculated and heavy handed, it completely misses the mark!!",1217808000,2,2637,5.701530612244898

8276048,4,B001A5070M,"Scary? No - fake documentary, yes.  Take the assumption that zombies, from low function and almost feral, to high function that can almost pass --and a movie idea, is born (or unborn, as it may be).  First, you really gotta like what they call Mockumentary just for the twist they have fun putting on a thing like that, and I do.  I liked it, good plot out and nicely set up, I felt well and realistically acted - and I will pop it in from time to time and find it a nice way to kill a few hours and still keeps me entertained.

8276049,3,B001A5070M,"Due to the social commentary so easily found within movies about zombies as well as budget restraints as the undead are such an easy 'monster' to create the whole 'shaky cam' or first person styled zombie movie has been on the rise so it should be no surprise that this was released in the same year as Romero's own documentary styled film ""Diary of the Dead."" However while Diary bills itself as a documentary maker who doesn't want to face reality, hides behind the camera, and as a social commentary on how the news works in general this film is slightly different. In the world of American Zombie the undead are not Romero's slow moving mindless zombies after their next tasty treat, in fact in American Zombie we get one of the earlier movies of the 'intelligent zombie' being fully in place. Not only are these zombies self aware but much like in the novel Breathers by S.G. Browne these zombies are known to exist and treated like second class citizens.

The saying of ""We're Here, We're Dead, Get Used To It!"" is the motto by which the undead of this documentary live by while trying to become the equals of the living that they once were. The 'documentary' starts as just a rough idea of the two filmmakers Grace Lee and John Solomon (who play themselves) that show how John sells Grace on the idea that they should work together to make a film about zombies. He wants to explore the culture of the living dead and while he is very much under the belief that they do live on human flesh and are the stereotypes of horror films he has seen she wants to show how they actually survive in society and are taken advantage of and abused.

This being the case they find four zombies that are some what connected to follow around. All four of these zombies are either directly or indirectly involved with each other or the Z.A.G. (Zombie Advocacy Group) which is the group that follows the slogan I mentioned earlier. These four zombies are Lisa (Jane Edith Wilson) who is a florist that wants to live a very zen like peaceful life, Joel (Al Vicente) who is the founder of Z.A.G. and clearly in charge, Ivan (Austin Basis) who is working a dead end job as a convenience store clerk and is clearly meant to be the comedic relief as someone we can make fun of, and finally Judy (Suzy Nakamura) who just wants to find someone who can love her that she can also love.

As many complaints as I do have about the film I have to admit that on the social commentary portion of things it really does hit the nail on the head. From sexism to bigotry the film really does capture some of the worst parts about humanity that are deemed ""OK"" against minorities in various social circles of the United States. While not as prominent as they once were all of these are still issues that come up and the documentary found a great way to address them - through putting zombies through them.

If you are a fan of documentary styled films you'll easily find quite a few aspects of this to enjoy. Watching it through the eyes of a zombie fanatic, making it a combination of a documentary AND adding in intelligent zombies just didn't feel right. The zombies being interviewed were portrayed as both too close together as well as too far apart socially, just didn't feel right. Still it's something zombie related AND a semi-original concept even though there were a few documentary styled films around at the same time it definitely did it in a different manner than the others. Again this one is only for the documentary lovers and hardcore zombie fans as there is little to no action, gore, and does involve the intelligent zombie which is still not fully accepted by lovers of the living dead.",1348963200,,3678,4.509745127436282

This is obviously supposed to be some kind of satire and/or social commentary as well as being a zombie movie. But, honestly, it fails on all fronts.

It's not a horror movie. There's effectively very little gore. What there is tends to be un-frightening and off-camera. If it's a satire, it not a very funny one. I never laughed once during the movie. So, it's certainly not a parody or spoof (Well, I suppose one could call it a parody, just not a funny one). It also seems to be a social commentary piece, but frankly it's social commentary that nobody seems to care about. Zombie rights? Mistreatment of zombies?

I really wanted to like this movie. But honestly, it bored me. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for it to all lead up to some real horror or some real laughs. It delivered absolutely nothing.

As to the characters themselves, humans and zombies, frankly there's nothing there. I certainly never invested any emotion into the characters. Couldn't really identify with them, and couldn't care less about what happened to any of them. The human were a bunch of whiny idiots. The zombies were equally whiny idiots. The characters never accomplish anything in the movie. There's no hero or villain, really. Even the zombie makeup effects weren't very good. Mostly, the ""zombies"" were portrayed as regular people nd had little by the way of ""zombie"" make-up, beyond some minor ""decaying skin"" or a tiny ""death wound"". Certainly nothing really zombie-ish. There were no shamblers, or hyper-zombies. No zombies with broken legs, or limbs dangling off, or really any gore of any kind.

As far as I'm concerned, this film is a failure on just about every level and I fail to see the point or relevance. It's not scary, funny or in any way poignant. Quite the waste of ""possibility.""
