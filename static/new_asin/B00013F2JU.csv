1968990,4,B00013F2JU,"I really enjoy this DVD.  It's refreshing, informative and easy to follow.  Ann Gilanders also has a book on reflexology with easy to follow pictures with directional arrows showing the movements the fingers should take.  And who could beat the price?",1202774400,3,251,5.073170731707317

1968993,5,B00013F2JU,"This video was shown to us by our instructor at the Massage School.  One of the best videos I have seen so far.  The setting, the explanation, history of reflexology, everything just took my breath away.  I have been a practicing reflexologist for the past 3 years, but I only studied beginner reflexology.  This video give you an indepth knowledge on how to treat various diseases.

Please note that this video only gives you information on how to work on the feet and not on the ears or hands.

Excellent work!",1341360000,,512,4.571428571428571

1968995,1,B00013F2JU,"I don't know when this video was filmed but it's in 4:3 format and video quality is worse than a low quality VHS tape (except the titles). This is not a DVD at all!

As for the content, the technique is not clearly shown (actually I have hardly found the technique section since the menu was also poorly designed).

If you are looking for a good massage videos, try Diana Haynes' titles. This video is not recommended at all.",1314057600,2,425,4.367088607594937

1968997,3,B00013F2JU,"I bought this on it's original VHS version called ""Reflexology and the living, loving woman"". I never finished it as it just bored me, and a friend wouldn't tolerate playing it even for the free reflexology. I will try again & update this review when I do.
There is a short intro about how important it is to take care of your feet and how walking barefoot naturally gives you reflexology by stepping on twigs and pebbles.
This is set at a patio by the beach to give a beautiful view. Anne Gillanders, a British woman w/short, curly light brown hair who looks to be in her 50s sits in a wicker chair working on a woman's as well as a man's feet on a table. Sometimes there are marker ink on their feet to show the organ areas more clearly. The lecture is split into chapters by body systems such as digestive, respiratory, etc. At the end she even demonstrates on a baby while he/she is held by his/her mother how to give reflexology on a baby.",1245196800,11,944,4.308988764044944
1968998,2,B00013F2JU,"The Reflexolgy massage DVD was supposed to have a wallet sized foot and hand chart included. It did not. I am happy you sent this review along as I have been with an ailing family member and did not have the time to email you prior to receiving this.
Thank you for any assistance you can give regarding this matter.
