I wish some restoration studio would re-master this movie from the original film strip.",1526515200,,249,4.813953488372093
8557866,3,B00AU6M07K,"A young girl is pursued by two men (wealthy man and loser) with whom she has love/hate relationships. She flees her romantic situation and moves from Venice to Rome to pursue a career in dance. Shes strangely affected and inspired by African rhythm music, and it appears dance is her true love. Both men still pursue her with many plot complications. The movie is dark, slow and moody. Although it has some star power and the acting is commendable, it is a true B movie of only average interest.",1477958400,,495,4.573033707865169

8557873,3,B00AU6M07K,It's really quite ok for the money.  It was interesting how the mambo was performed back then and fun to watch the dancers.  I enjoy the leading Italian actors but Shelly Winters looks tired and bored and probably was used only for her name...she was married to actor Gassman at the time and maybe was hanging around on the set with nothing to do.,1362009600,3,347,4.40625
