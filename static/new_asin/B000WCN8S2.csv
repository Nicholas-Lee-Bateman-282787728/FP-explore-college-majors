2966897,5,B000WCN8S2,"For me, this is a great fun way to use my weights and workout.  I love
most of Karen Voight's workouts.",1224806400,2,103,3.9047619047619047
2966898,4,B000WCN8S2,"Karen is such a good instructor; she really is in my top 5.  She cues well and is motivating without being over the top and she's friendly to boot and makes working out fun (or more fun).
This is a short workout (about a half hour) that is easy to do and enjoyable.  It is an upper body and ab workout that is more intermediate geared, I'd say.  I don't think it's overly strenuous; maybe it's even a little short and there could be more reps sometimes.  If you feel like you'd like more reps, then use heavier weights and you might get better results.  Sometimes you really need total focus to achieve the movements (like the tricep and bridge sequence).
I love the fact that this is done on the ball because it makes a change from most of my other workouts.  It's fun to do and the time flies and her graceful style of teaching separates her from othe instructors.  I like doing this one and even find it a little relaxing even though you are working out.  I highly recommend this one.",1218067200,16,987,4.297297297297297
2966899,5,B000WCN8S2,"This excellent video is what the title promises- a toning workout using a balance ball.  I don't have any other videos by Voight-she is a clear and encouraging instructor on this.  There is an example of a more intense version of some exercises in the lady behind Voight.  The DVD can either ""play all"" or play individual sections, which is convenient for creating a customized workout.  The exercises are easy to follow and work out the major muscle groups.  There is a warm-up, followed by some core exercise (neglected back and upper leg muscles), a ""heavy"" dumbbell section (10lb) that works out the chest and upper back,  a ""light"" dumbbell section (5lb) for the arms and shoulders, then an abs section.  Perhaps the legs are a little neglected, save some modified squats.  It would be easy to add lunges and calf raises to do this however, on your own.  Equipment needed includes a balance ball at a size where thighs are parallel to ground, light dumbells, and heavier dumbells.",1208044800,40,985,4.781065088757397
2966900,5,B000WCN8S2,"The emphasis is on upper body and abs in this 30 minute workout.  There's a 5 minute warm-up and stretch and 20 minutes of toning.  You can do the entire workout or choose the warm-up, stretch and 4 toning sections individually.  The sections are: core conditioning, heavy weights, light weights and abdominals.  The core conditioning section includes push ups and back extensions.  In the weight sections, you'll mostly focus on upper body with some interesting and effective combinations.  Even though the sections are short, you'll really feel it especially if you use 5-8 lb weights.  There's a few moves with the legs; but nothing really significant.  The abdominal section has a few crunches on the ball.  You'll also place the ball in various positions to really work the lower abs.  I enjoyed this workout.  Karen is an excellent instructor.  She cues well and gives good form pointers.",1205539200,29,894,5.006802721088436
2966901,5,B000WCN8S2,"As always, Karen gives an effective, precisely instructed work-out. She could have made more interesting use of the ball, which mostly functions as a weight-training bench in this DVD.  Her B-L-T (Butt, Legs & Tummy on a Ball) workout is more creative, I think, but that's nit picking.  Karen has never made a workout that is a waste of time -- she's simply the best.",1200355200,19,367,4.630769230769231

This is for you if you like intermediate workouts, you can make it advance after getting familiar with the routine by increasing weights.  I used 5 lbs and 8lbs and now am challenging myself with 10 and 12 lbs.",1367884800,,345,4.292307692307692
