6016548,5,B00FP20VO8,I was a zombie extra in this movie. It was an absolute pleasure to work on. The crew was great. I hope that people really enjoy this movie. Because they worked hard to get out.,1398124800,,176,4.057142857142857
6016549,1,B00FP20VO8,"JoAnn (Joanne Tombo) like runs a fashion blog and like has an annoying habit of using ""like"" all the time when she talks. She is being filmed for a documentary as they travel the town in winter. The crew goes to some railroad tracks where bodies are dumped then to a wake of  Bobby who died in Afghanistan. Here we meet The Colonel (Patrick Kilpatrick) who brought back his ashes and see a local band get plugged.

About 19 minutes into this 75 minute film, we have zombies. At this point the camera work becomes impossible. Kids screaming in the dark. And the question of who is filming during a zombie attack and why aren't the zombies bothering with the light and camera man? Our group of young adults seek refuge in an old Catholic school where they encounter another camera crew filming ""Ghost Busters."" Together they annoy us to no end.

Eventually they encounter The Zombinator (Joseph Aviel) who explains why Youngstown is infested with zombies which is mentioned in the Amazon Review by-lines. And while all this is going on Yanna (Diana Lotus)  decides to break-up with Scott (Scott Alin) who only takes her to zombie parties, while Marcus (Justin Brown) tells us of his boyhood father issues.

The film goes from ""could be good"" to ""remarkably dumb and boring"" with dumb and boring scenes lasting way too long.

6016554,1,B00FP20VO8,"Worst movie ever! One star is being generous. I'm a connoisseur of 3rd rate horror/zombie movies and this movie fell short in every category that constitutes an even watchable movie.

If you just want to watch a bunch of stupid college kids talk about nothing relevant to the movie, this is the flick for you!

I would give this movie negative stars if I could!!!",1456272000,,363,4.569230769230769
6016555,1,B00FP20VO8,"Nothing good to say about this. I think that the most annoying thing about it, besides the acting and camera work, plot and dialogue was that these college kids are portrayed to be obnoxious, self-centered little brats who can't handle a broken fingernail much less a zombie attack, You will be wishing that all of them get eaten just to stop their whining. This movie does for millennials what Amos'n Andy did for civil rights.",1454976000,2,428,4.72

It plays more going through a halloween haunt than a movie. I think mistake #1 was watching this sober. The loud talking, screaming, yelling made this a hard watch but i wasn't bored. Obvious audio and focus, plot holes, well, you don't go into this movie for quality, you see it because of the title. There should be T-shirts ""I watched Zombinator""",1453248000,,498,4.483516483516484
6016558,1,B00FP20VO8,"Painful, no budget effort. Little, if any character (& story) consistency, lots of padding, and, yes, a guy who bares a resemblance to the disastrous governor of California. In a minor role, Kilpatrick does a decent job, and gets in a a few good lines. But that's far from enough for even a second star.",1449014400,,303,4.527272727272727

It's a horrible mix of screaming, not being able to see anything, poor directing, and a cheap rip off of a terminator.",1444435200,,146,4.407407407407407

6016562,1,B00FP20VO8,Camera work was ok in some scenes. Really not a fun movie to watch.,1442707200,,67,3.857142857142857
6016563,1,B00FP20VO8,"This movie is just plain terrible!  The movie is shot all in handheld POV, and there is just way too much talking about stuff I don't care about in this movie.  I pretty much had to fast forward the entire party scene because I was so bored with it.

The zombies were lame and their make-up was poorly done and I didn't for one second think they were zombies.  The guy who was supposed to be the ""Terminator"" rip-off guy also had a lame costume.  It's like someone went to a thrift store, bought a black trench coat, some sunglasses, a toy gun and said, ""There ya go, I'm the Terminator!""  As far as the characters, they have no depth, they're all just there to be killed off and frankly I couldn't care less about any of them.

So what was the best part of this movie?  The cover art of the DVD case.  Yes, the best part of this movie was the cover of the DVD case.  I would honestly rather stare at that for 90 minutes than watch this movie.  Oh and if you are waiting to see a Terminator endoskeleton in this movie like you did in Terminator and T2 towards the end of the movie, don't bother, it's not in the movie.

So all in all, don't bother watching this movie, it's terrible and a waste of time.",1442534400,2,1203,4.137931034482759

6016569,3,B00FP20VO8,"This is a good zombie movie. The only problem I had was that the heroes could kill the zombies by shooting them in the stomach, the heart, and other places of the body. Come on, we all know the rule ---- you have to shoot a zombie in the head to kill them. What next? Are they going to make a werewolf picture that allows the humans to shoot it in the leg and it bleeds to death? Or how about a vampire that has it's fangs removed and that kills it? The acting was acceptable. Storyline - acceptable. Overall, pretty good except for my earlier bitch. Enjoy. I did.",1438473600,,564,4.136363636363637

6016578,1,B00FP20VO8,"This movie was so bad that my eight year old hated it.  Do you want to watch a movie that has some of the worst acting you have ever seen, a special effects department that looked like they were working with a twenty dollar budget and nothing at all to do with the cover art?  If you are expecting a cyborg killing machine, look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for a movie to have a Mystery Science Theater 3000 night with some of your friends, this is perfect.  I rented this free as a member of Prime, and I still felt ripped off.  Just a terrible film with no redeeming qualities at all.  The only five star reviews of this film came from people actually in it.  Pure schlock, and not a film so bad that it was kind of enjoyable, just a terrible, awful waste of time.

The inane plot structure, detached acting, and wooden production techniques have left a permanent impression upon her. Now, she begins homework assignments promptly at 4;30pm, and labors upon them diligently until she completes the assignments, no matter how long it takes. She talks frequently of becoming a trained mercenary when she grows up. Thanks Zombinator !! This is the best disobedient child disciplining tool I have ever come upon.

If i every catch up with anyone associated with the making and distribution of this movie i will demand my money and restitution for time wasted.

Not sure what type of movie this is but...zombie is it not... yeah there are dead people walking around...they look like people that have been paid to walk around stiff in fake blood. It's supposed to be about a girl who has a film crew following her around as she speaks of fashion, going to railroad tracks talking about murder and how it's okay that the place has a reputation for murders but it's still a cool place because it's such a cool place and people often do fashion shoots at railroad tracks or yards...blah, blah, blah...they see blood on a concrete pillar, talk about it, blah, blah blah...leave then camera crew look at said blood splotch and one is so stupid he allows himself to be dared into licking it...yeah, licking it.  See how dumb it is..they wind up at a wake/party and get attacked by fake looking zombies...running, hiding, fighting among each other...all done ala Blair Witch... I attempted to watch it but couldn't get past 20 minutes...it is soooo bad!!
