6674185,3,B00NOHAYJ8,"FRIDAY THE 13TH DOUBLE FEATURE BLU-RAY, 2 for the price of one what a bargain
this new Double feature Blu-ray has been sold out twice now since it's release date back in september
amazon managed to get some more copies in for the 2nd time around
 so i was about to place an order for it on amazon
but just missed on the last copy from another seller, Unbelieveable
so for the past month or 2, I've been checking the listing to find out what date amazon will expect more copies back in
I was checking every week, but until now I think it's a lost cause that this Double feature will be back instock for amazon
cause it's be nearly 2months now since the last bunch of copies were available to buy on amazon website
so I thought my last option is to buy of amazon Canada
they still have plenty instock so I got myself a copy the Canada version has French & English print on the cover art of course
but no French print of the Discs
I was Desperate to buy this Double feature so I bought the Canada version which has the same content as the U.S. version
just the cover art is Different
this Double feature Blu-ray is exactly what you see on the listing
standard Blu-ray case with 2 Disc inside, Disc 1 is Friday the 13th Uncut version & Disc 2 is the sequel
all the special features from the Deluxe edition dvd's have been carried over to both Discs
now to the picture quality, being Blu-ray I expect High definition quality not a Digital remaster, big Difference
well Paramount's HD transfer for both films is very Good but not perfect HD
the quality is better than the Deluxe dvd quality that's for sure but not excellent
so it's between I think there's still some Grain & Dirt in the picture but most of it is very sharp & clear
much sharper & clearer than the old DVD version no Doubt about it
the sound quality is DolbytrueHD 5.1 which is like a master audio mix
so the sound is slightly better than the old Dolby digital mix
is this double feature worth getting, yes I think it is worth Upgrading to buy this new double feature
but if you already have the original Blu-ray versions from 2009, then best to keep them.
about 3 stars I gave this double feature, if the HD transfer were perfectly clear no Grain or dirt then I would give 5 stars",1449964800,,2242,4.262910798122066

6674188,4,B00NOHAYJ8,"And here we find ourselves with yet another series of re-releases of the Friday the 13th franchise.

There are no versions of the feature films. There are no new special features. The contents of these discs is exactly identical to those that were included in the 2013 blu-ray box set that collected the Paramount franchise up to and including Freddy vs Jason and the 2009 remake. For those of you who own that now OOP set, there's nothing new to gain from buying these two disc sets.

The practical upshot of these is that if you don't own the complete set, you can pick and choose which films you'd rather have in relative comfort, and it also saves you the grief of the horrifying packaging that was inflicted upon the 2013 complete series box set (discs were damaged by the cardboard sleeve casing, as well as ill-placed dollops of packaging glue). Just be warned that your order may take some time to ship: I pre-ordered the Part V/Part VI set here at Amazon -- those are my favorite films in the series -- and it has yet to ship and is listed as temporarily out of stock. This in spite of my having placed the pre-oder back in July. It seems the sets are selling relative well, then.

If you haven't picked up the complete series box set, you could do a whole lot worse than to pick up all of the Blu-ray Double Feature Sets. They sell at a great price and you get all the content on the full set.",1441670400,4,1403,4.347328244274809

8679523,5,B00NOHAYJ8,"I don't need to say much but both 1 and 2 had it all, sex, blood, gore, death and most importantly a psychotic villain with a twisted mind. Mrs. Voorhees and jason started it all and please note that the sequel was better because it first introduced Jason as the villian. Crazy death scenes, suspense and screams galore.",1484784000,,320,4.5344827586206895
