Have you ever had tasks which are extremely difficult to do -- say like taking care of a sick person or any of the mundane boring tasks we get ""stuck"" with or maybe an unpleasant boss or relative?  Well maybe this will help.  I did study this part day after day after day for a long period of time while caring for  a bedridden person -- 6 years -- based on Eckhart's teachings on surrender. Its the first disk.  The rest is wonderful too.  Can change your life if you relax into it.  If by chance you don't resonate with it, keep it in a safe place.  It will.  I am amazed at how much more is covered than when I first viewed it 10 or 12 years ago.",1480636800,2,810,4.069620253164557
