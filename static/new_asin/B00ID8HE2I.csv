8641093,1,B00ID8HE2I,Terrible movie. Don't waste your money,1441670400,,38,5.5
8641094,1,B00ID8HE2I,"The film gives you the feeling it is the end of the world, but that was just a frequent overuse of the production company over promoting itself during the opening. We then see a bunch of old Nazi stuff and two bad female actors pretending to sob loudly while dad injects himself in the chest. We them switch to 10 years later and to color film as we poorly build the character of a few college girls, who eventually drive into the desert, the same desert where our Nazi girls live. If you read the back of the DVD, its says the rest.

The film was low budget and bad. It switches back to black and white for no particular reason. The acting was sad, dialogue poor, and plot not well developed. The zombies were boring.

Guide: F-bomb, grope, brief nudity.",1430784000,,755,4.347517730496454

8641096,4,B00ID8HE2I,"Blood Soaked is definately different. The story revolving around a young girl crossing paths with psychotic nazi sisters that use their fathers serum to create zombies was very entertaining. Be warned though, Like another review stated, The film goes from color to b&w around 25 mins. into it. So if you're looking for something a little bit different? Blood Soaked is it! Thanx for reading.",1405555200,,391,5.030769230769231
8641097,4,B00ID8HE2I,"Films like Blood Soaked is what I love the most about independent film making these days, the nuts to take a chance and give us something different. On paper or even in review, this film seems like some idea you have seen done before or at least they tried to attempt before, but Blood Soaked is so creative and unique that it really feels fresh and new. I thought the backstory with the mom and Pipers boyfriend was sort of un-necessary, but it was less than 3 minutes and was the only negative I could think of about this film.

At 70 minutes this film offers you so much, but it never felt rushed and it never dragged, it was just right. The pacing of this film was what I was really impressed by, with the lesbian overtones they never made them feel sleazy or for us to feel like we were perverts, and on the flip side the violence and sadistic nature of this film was just so smart. They gave you a calm that will have you interested and invested in, and they gave you a storm that will have you excited again about the horror genre.

I can honestly say no matter what is playing at the multiplex and disguising itself as horror, you may want to avoid those jokes and seek this film out. This film is really creative and a really good fun ride into some sick ass fun s***. Blood Soaked is awesome and every horror fan should make it a point to seek it out.",1405382400,,1361,4.190839694656488
8641098,1,B00ID8HE2I,"All these great reviews make this movie sound fun, but unfortunately it's not. And only the first 26 minutes of this movie is in color. The rest of it is black and white. You would think Wild Eye Releasing would give that information on back of the DVD case. But they don't.",1403481600,,274,4.288461538461538
8641099,5,B00ID8HE2I,"Fantastic!  Exactly what gore should be!  You will not be disappointed with this very well put together flick, i mean who doesn't like college lesbians, natzies, blood, and good gore?!?",1403136000,,185,5.133333333333334
8641100,5,B00ID8HE2I,Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Well done Red Letter! A great combination of all the things that make gore great. Check it out!,1402876800,,122,4.857142857142857
