6373946,4,B00JKTFQTM,American Promise is a stirring documentary about the 13-year educational journey of two African American boys. Watching these boys become young men was moving for my family.,1411344000,2,173,5.444444444444445
6373947,5,B00JKTFQTM,"This is a great documentary. The experiences of young men in the movie are quite interesting. The movie put faces to the implicit biases and unconscious racism that black men experience within our society. While watching this movie, your emotions get intertwined with the characters; you feel both their joy and pain. This is by far the best documentary Ive seen.
The book, ""Promises Kept: Raising Black Boys to Succeed in School and in Life makes this a great package and equips our society with the tools needed to combat the issues raised in the film. Thanks to the directors/authors Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster for starting the conversation on these issues.",1410480000,6,669,4.982142857142857

6373950,5,B00JKTFQTM,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. I watched it on movie night at my son's charter school along with several other families. It was interesting to see how the boys were affected emotionally by attending Dalton (the private school in the movie). I have struggled with rather I should send my child to a PWI but after watching this film, I believe I've made my decision.

6373954,5,B00JKTFQTM,"I enjoyed this film and the opportunity to learn about both of these young men.  As parents we want what's best for our children and this film showed how the families of the two young men raised them differently and also showed that there isn't a ""right"" or ""wrong"" way. I appreciated both perspectives and I look forward to the next documentary, post-college.",1424649600,,360,4.714285714285714

8652007,5,B00JKTFQTM,"Filmed mostly in NYC, it follows two six-year old boys as they enroll in Dalton Prep, a highly competitive school, and grow up through many challenges and victories. It's 13 years of their lives and it's an amazing piece of filmmaking, both moving and eye-opening. It is so different for me to see just how involved these parent were. One set of parents were also the filmmakers. I suspect that it was hard to make the decision as to what needed to be shown to the audience about their own journey. Very honest film.",1484179200,2,516,4.5

8652011,2,B00JKTFQTM,"If you want to watch a mother berate her child for years while that child grows up, this film is for you. Will he be ""successful?"" Probably, he was badgered into it. Will he ever want to be around his mother once he's an adult? That's another story entirely. I hope he finds a good therapist.",1468195200,,292,4.232142857142857
