8140508,5,B0000714DP,"This is an older film but the impact isn't diminished by the fourteen years since it's release.

 BANGED OUT depicts a harsh, raw, but mesmerizing portrait of life in the ghetto. Hear a loud noise in some communities, you shrug and ask, ""what was that?"" In this neighborhood, you hit the pavement and wonder if you or someone nearby has been shot. It's a culture shock for someone who's knowledge of the hood is only what you've seen on film or on the news. It's disturbing to realize that what Richard McGregor adeptly brings to life in this film is reality.

After you get past the shock of how grim life is for some folks, you begin to care about them. You want to hug the mother fired from her job because she is accused of stealing jewelry that he son stole for drug money. You're concerned for the young ones coming up and wonder if there is a way for them to escape the fate of their older peers. You're concerned for the teenage girl being warned by her brother not to ""end up like mom."" And the cousins...their destiny was set before the film even began. It was just a matter of time.

Not since ""Winter's Bone"" depicted harsh life in the Ozarks have I been as affected by a film. Life shouldn't be like this and it's hard to walk away unaffected.",1459123200,,1256,4.3319148936170215
