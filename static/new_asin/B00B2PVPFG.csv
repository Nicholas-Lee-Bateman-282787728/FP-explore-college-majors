SHOWS. THE SITES IN THE SHOW ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THE ACTING IS GOOD.",1398211200,,120,4.761904761904762
5553225,4,B00B2PVPFG,"Really liked the series! Only wish it had English sub-titles. When they are talking in the plane, you can't understand what they are saying because of the ""noise of the airplane.' Also wish they would feature more Arctic animals. None the less, will probably purchase season 2. Adam Beach is one of my favorite actors.",1397692800,3,318,4.8
5553226,1,B00B2PVPFG,"Before removing the wrapper, I heard rattling inside, so I knew that one or more of the DVDs had shattered.  There wasn't anything in the box to provide cushioning, so I wasn't surprised that it broke.  Yes, I received a refund, but I just wanted the product.  I would have preferred receiving a replacement - not broken - but that wasn't an option.  Sometimes, the amount of effort entailed is more than I'm willing to expend, so I'll just watch Arctic Air online someday.",1391904000,,473,4.595238095238095
5553227,5,B00B2PVPFG,Delightful show!  The characters are believable and the stories are refreshing.  The scenery is spectacular!  I'm very anxious for Amazon to offer Season 2.,1388016000,2,156,5.416666666666667
5553228,5,B00B2PVPFG,"I am having trouble being patient for the second season to come out on DVD.  This is an amazing series with really, really colorful characters.  It is quirky and sweet in a sharp kind of way.",1386547200,,191,4.277777777777778
5553229,5,B00B2PVPFG,"First knew of Pascale Hutton on Sanctuary, so when I heard about this CBC series which is not shown in the States I order the DVD.  Love it.",1368662400,6,140,4.0
5553230,5,B00B2PVPFG,"I was impressed with this series or at least the episodes I have seen.  I thought Adam Beach played his part of the know it all part owner returning home to become a pilot again really well.  Kevin McNulty was great as the crusty majority owner of the airline.

Loved the music especially the throat singing in the title.  Great idea for a series, I just hope that this contiues",1365379200,7,378,4.357142857142857
5553231,5,B00B2PVPFG,"I fell in love with these stories of the north, the actors are great. I love the actor Adam Beach, i cant wait 2 buy the 2cd season. please keep it going and i will buy each series. thanks for a great series.",1361750400,4,208,3.86046511627907
5553232,4,B00B2PVPFG,"I enjoyed it very much  as I am a fan of Adam Beach and I love  any thing filmed in northwest Canada and Alaska, since I cannot go there it is my only way to see it",1436054400,,164,3.4054054054054053
5553233,5,B00B2PVPFG,"Canada may not have the reputation for producing great television that the U.S. and Great Britain have but that's the fault of reviewers and not the very talented men and women who have brought us ""The Murdoch Mysteries"" and ""Republic of Doyle.""
Sadly, one of the best Canadian offerings crashed and burned when Ottawa chopped funds from the CBC and, thus, killed off 'Arctic Air' after three seasons. It's sad because this was a well-thought-out series featuring some of the country's best writers and actors. In a self-defeating move, the government's decision to cut off funding for this extremely entertaining series also did away with some of the best advertising ever for Canadian tourism because 'Arctic Air' was full of wonderful images of the country's Western environs.
Adam Beach and Pascale Hutton starred in this series that centered around a struggling airline based in Yellowknife. The airline is run by a bunch of independent, albeit a little quirky, people who give viewers a sense of the grit and determination - as well as the humor - that is characteristic of Canadians. Beach and Hutton were ably backed up by some of the country's best character actors including Kevin McNulty, who does a wonderful job as the head of the airline. The series was also notable for giving First Nations actors a prominent role, both as heroes and villains.
The scripts were well written and believable; the direction in every episode was well paced. The photography was outstanding and the scenery was, well let's just say it was impressive.
It's a shame that this wonderful series fell victim to government budget cutters who were unable to see what a truly remarkable vehicle it was for promoting the image of Canadians around the globe.",1426809600,9,1742,4.969178082191781
5553234,5,B00B2PVPFG,Enjoyed Arctic Air and have the First season.  Reminds me of some of the incidences we experienced while living in the North.  Love seeing the NWT sites!  Are there any other seasons available or it this all we get?,1426809600,,215,4.461538461538462

5553236,5,B00B2PVPFG,"I love this show, I am waiting for Season 2 of the show to be available in US.  It's too bad that it is so hard to watch Canadian shows in the US.",1423872000,,146,3.4242424242424243
5553237,4,B00B2PVPFG,This is an enjoyable series and the acting is very good. I'm a big fan of Adam  Beach and most anything that he is in.  Am looking forward to watching Season 2  & 3 to see how the characters evolve. It seems that in the first season everything is in a state of turmoil over the flying service and whether it will make it or  not.,1420848000,,329,3.9393939393939394

And it can be funny too. Excellent show.",1405296000,,246,4.72093023255814
5553241,5,B00B2PVPFG,"NOTE:  This review was originally posted on Amazon. Ca on December 30 2013 as I purchased this wonderful show (both Season 1 and 2--Three is not available yet) from them.

I have long been envious of Canada's television industry being willing to develop and air shows that depict subjects I am interested in seeing. As such, I infrequently search through Amazon. Ca for gems like Arctic Air. Indeed, since I purchased The Complete First Season back on November 11, 2012, I have been quite diligent in checking for Season Two (which I finally ordered on December 4), which will finally come out January 7, 2014. I sure hope I won't have to wait so long to get Season Three. I cannot say enough about how much I enjoy this great show, which I wished would air the the states; but then the people here are not well known for having good tastes in television shows!",1404259200,,861,4.548387096774194

When a lucrative business deal lures him back to Yellowknife, he learns that the company his father founded, Arctic Air, is on the brink of bankruptcy.  Will he stay and help out the fledgling company or turn his back again on family and friends and pursue the lucrative deal that brought him back to Yellowknife in the first place?  Beautiful scenery of the Northwest Territories forms the backdrop of this well acted series with believable story lines.  Plus it stars Adam Beach!  'Nuf said.",1456963200,2,635,4.7889908256880735

I'm hooked.  Began watching this afternoon, now it's evening and still watching, on the second disc.
