7363305,4,B013F01ATQ,"There are about 4 or 5 movies that Lifetime produced with the ""At 17"" tag. They are all quite good tv movies. Missing at 17 involves a girl who is upset after finding out that she is adopted and she rebels. The story involves what her relation is to her adopted parents, her birth mother and brother, and her new boyfriend. You can find a whole lot worse ways of spending an hour and a half. This is a good movie for what it is. If you are expecting a Hollywood blockbuster, don't watch this movie but it gets your attention and you will probably enjoy it.",1482105600,2,556,4.205607476635514
