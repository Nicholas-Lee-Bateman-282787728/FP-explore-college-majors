8712053,1,B00W3XJ9MW,"A very poorly made video. The useful information is easily lost to the host's grating voice and amateur video editing. His demonstrations, particularly the rolling demos, show poor technique.  I don't know if he has been injured or his health deteriorated so he cant demonstrate good form, but then he should get an assistant.  One scene looks like it was filmed in front of a cheap motel.  Save yourself some frustration, pass this one by",1473120000,5,439,4.826666666666667
