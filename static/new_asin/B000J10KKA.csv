2665133,5,B000J10KKA,"i bought season 1,2 and 3 and loved them all.. all you people bitching about the music being all bad.. well what do you expect its from the late 80's and early 90's? season 3 is my favorite out of the 3 seasons out so far, but if your buying them it would help if you buy and watch them in order. I cant wait until all 11 seasons are on dvd. This was definaly worth the money!",1171065600,9,376,3.8333333333333335
2665134,4,B000J10KKA,"I have to say that I like being able to get Baywatch on dvd now!!  I loved the show!  The only problem I had with the dvds is the fact that you have to purchase all the seasons in order to get season 1. This is why it only gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Other than that, I loved it.  As far as the music, I really didn't care for it when the show was on tv, much less on dvd.  I watched it for the plots and the dvd captured those!",1170892800,3,428,3.5591397849462365
2665135,1,B000J10KKA,"I've purchased seasons one and two thus far. If this third set is as poorly done as the first two, stear clear. If you remember the old LPs that stated ""all songs performed by original artists"" meant that the songs were rerecorded. The first 2 sets were poorly done. Season One, from NBC has been named ""bonus"" selections. this is clearly a ploy to force a collector to purchase all seasons just to aquire the true first season.

The music on the series is nothing short of annnoying. It simply is poor and detracts from our collective memory. the picture quality is poor and looks extremely worn and dated. I can't get over the music. It is really that bad. Bad enough that this set should be rejected by consumers.

One can't help but feel cheated when the waited for DVD set lacks the original audio (replaced by truly awful songs), and the picture quality so poor.",1163376000,23,868,4.522292993630574

2665236,3,B000J10KKA,"I Bought Seasons 1, 2 & 3. 1 & 2 were what I expected. But Season 3 had the episodes from season 4 not season 3. I recently bought season 4 and it verified that the episodes in the season 3 dvd set were the same as Season 4. It is to late to return Season 3 and get my money back so I am a bit upset about this. Also there was a site that was selling all the episodes as 1 purchase and I tried to order this set but found out it was being sent for China and by bank would not allow the purchase so now I am back to trying to buy each season 1 at a time, but it is alot more expenisive this way. But Baywatch was one of my favorite shows and would like all of the seasons if I can find them. Good luck to all of you. I rated this item 3 because it is not really Season 3.",1353024000,,770,3.562130177514793

2665238,5,B000J10KKA,Baywatch - season 3 is a good series about lifeguards and police action. The cast and plots are good and I am looking forward to buying more seasons. It did not have any defects such as the ones on disc four of season two.,1334534400,,222,4.068181818181818

2665242,5,B000J10KKA,"This season was really great,most of the episodes had everything,action,adventure,drama,romance and a bit of comedy at times, alot of the episodes had a very good plot to them as well, this show brings back alot of memories of when i originally watched it,i remember the WB network used to air it on Saturdays, my favorite Baywatch babe was Yasmine Bleeth,she was so hot,only thing i didn't like about it as alot of people have said is the original music is gone and replaced with other music in the opening and closing credits as well as the in episode songs, but its not really that big of a deal as long as no parts we're edited out and everything is uncut, overall great dvd set, highly recommended for any baywatch fan.",1317168000,,724,4.576923076923077

2665244,2,B000J10KKA,i thought i had order season 3 and some how don't tell me how i got season 4 of baywatch instead !!!! they ruined the beginning of the show using different music for the theme song !!! so i wouldn't waste your money !!!,1308614400,,219,4.0
2665245,2,B000J10KKA,"The Amazon page makes it clear that this is actually season 4 instead of the 3 it's labeled as, which is annoying, but whatever.  The major issue is the music.

As is common for DVDs of shows from this era, getting the rights to the music they included involves a renegotiation and some new payments.  Clearly, the powers-that-be decided it wasn't worth it, because they replaced most of the music, INCLUDING THE THEME SONG, with poorly chosen and not particularly good replacements that don't work with the (admittedly already weak) dramatic moments.  It's extremely distracting, and makes a weak show even harder to watch- I got this for my boyfriend because he has fond memories of the show and a bunch of VHS tapes that I'd like to get rid of, and he couldn't make it through an episode.

If you actually want to watch this, buy the German print, they love Hasslehoff enough that they've paid for the original music- they even have the American dialog as an option.",1282780800,7,969,4.676470588235294

2665288,2,B000J10KKA,"I used to like this 1993-94 Season of BAYWATCH partly because this was the season when it still had Summer(Nicole Eggert), Matt(David Charvet), and CJ(Pamela Anderson)in it, but now I cant even stand this show anymore since I now realize it was overrated and redundant and constantly changing co-stars on this show every year too, plus the saves and the stories seemed to have become less and less impressive and a lot phonier and phonier every year along with the fact that I now realize that the only thing that kept this show so popular for so long and kept the ratings up for so long was because guys used to watch this show every week just watch the cute female co-stars on this show and all the beautiful girls in bikinis run around in their underwear on the beach, which kind of made BAYWATCH like a tit show along with the fact that BAYWATCH started becoming a show about taking lives instead of saving lives after while since co-stars kept dying off one by one in the last few seasons of this show which disuaded numerous people from wanting to go to Malibu, which also prompted David Hasselhoff(Mitch)to leave the show and have his Mitch Bucanon character die off since this show was running out of steam and was not going in the right direction since BAYWATCH had lasted way too long and had overstayed its welcome along with the fact that the whole cast & crew of BAYWATCH were all obviously getting tired and running out of gas.

No wonder most of the BAYWATCH DVD season box sets are being discontinued by the manufacturer.",1249862400,,1537,4.568840579710145

Actually I`m waiting for seasons 5 and on, cause that`s when Yasmine Bleeth(!) enters the show(nothing 'fake' there!). The picture quality/resolution should be better too the more the series goes. Picture quality is really not the greatest on these early seasons. Not expecting HD of course, but this is like VHS quality.",1213747200,,399,4.970149253731344

2665292,1,B000J10KKA,"Don't get me wrong. I love BAywatch, but I simply can't watch the series on dvd. I feel like I just threw money away, like being cheated on. The theme song has been altered, as have the end credits. And as if that wasn't enough, many of the music clips during the episodes, have other songs. It simply doesn't work, as I've come to love the music montages. I want the true show on dvd, with the original music and montages. If shipping to the US weren't so expensive, I'd ship the three season I have straight back to Fremantle. This is not what I paid for. I guess I'll have to buy the German version.",1188259200,,602,4.198275862068965
2665293,4,B000J10KKA,"By the third season, the series had better scripts and improved from the first season.  Only flaw is that some of the best cast comes in later during the series.  Erin Gray, for example, doesn't appear until season 8.  Remember Erin Gray?  Buck Rogers and the 25th Century?  (Though I cannot see her until season 8 is released, I do get to see her at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Maryland this September.)  Still, the scripts improved as the series continued and season 3 is a great starting point if you don't want to watch them in chronological order.  Amazon's price is cheaper than Best Buy.",1179446400,3,607,4.669811320754717
2665294,3,B000J10KKA,I have always liked season three of baywatch for the reason that I always liked Matt and Summer together and this is the season that it happens.  The stories are not bad at all.  This is an enjoyable season to watch of baywatch.,1178841600,2,228,4.27906976744186
2665295,5,B000J10KKA,"Okay, some people are complaining because they think the picture quality is really poor. I don't know what everybody is complaining about. Today, with the new HD technology everything looks clear and really great, but you have to think about it. Baywatch was made in the early 90s before HD technology. So when you are used to watching things with clear and concise pictures, of course it is going too look not all that great.

I love Baywatch and have been since I was a kid. I am so happy that it is out on DVD and I can't wait for all seasons to come out. I already have seasons 1 and 2. As soon as I can afford it I am going to get season 3.

As far as having to buy all the seasons in order to get the true first season, it doesn't really bother me. If you are going to buy all the seasons anyway, then you really are saving money because that's one less season you have to buy.

As far as the music goes, I did love the original TV version opening and ending songs, but the show is what I really love, so I am just glad to be getting a chance to own them so I can watch them whenever I want.

As far as missing episodes go, I have all missing episodes on VHS. Sure it would be nice to have them on DVD, but we don't always get what we want.

Anyway, love the show, love the DVDs and can't wait to own them all.",1171411200,4,1316,3.950943396226415
