8592745,4,B00DF2DH8C,"Back in the 1960s I made an effort each week to watch this Quinn Martin production because I found the recurring characters (Efram Zimbalist, Jr., Phillip Abbott and WIlliam Reynolds) especially convincing as were the story lines. Over the subsequent years, I often wondered when the annual episodes would be available on DVDs.  When I learned that my wish had come to pass, I looked forward again to spending time with my favorite FBI show.

I arbitrarily selected for my first purchase The Fifth Season because by then the show had hit its stride.  An early attempt to make Inspector Erskine multi-dimensional (a widower with a grown daughter and potential romantic attachments) had been dismissed and the documentary form was adopted in total.  It's really no wonder that J. Edgar Hoover and his minions warmly embraced this singularly produced series and assisted heavily in it.

The viewer forgets that Zimbalist, Abbott and Reynolds are actors.  They personify what Americans at the time felt were the characteristics of the typical Special Agent.  Some of the episodes necessarily are more gripping than others because of scope of the agency's authority, but all hold one's interest.  Many of them featured unknown ""guest stars"" who later became household words, e.g., Harrison Ford.

I am reasonably sure that the only reason the show didn't continue through the entire 1970s was the direct result of the Watergate scandal and its aftermath on the FBI.

I plan to purchase further years' output because for a brief time I am transported back to an earlier time when you could watch well done shows that entertained, yet were free of gratuitous violence and the constant use of profanity.",1401840000,6,1695,5.043010752688172

8592747,5,B00DF2DH8C,"I was hunkered down and lying in wait for this product, when much to my surprise it was released sooner than expected. If you've ever seen this show you know it is very well made, and fun to watch. Add that to the great guests and cast, and you have something to behold. I got mine from Warner Brothers, and they wasted no time getting it to me. Now let's pray for season 6 and the rest!",1372032000,9,387,4.038961038961039
