3862935,4,B00279JW0Q,"As the other reviewer stated, if you care at all about AI or Kelly, this is a must-see. The free surfing in the latter part of the film is absolutely incredible and a reminder of why these two are who they are. There is a reason why Kelly is known as the best surfer ever. Watch it and you'll understand.",1277251200,2,304,4.083333333333333

8354311,5,B00279JW0Q,"I bought this as a gift for my son. Of all the surf videos he has (and he has TONS!), he says this one and ""Castles in the Sky"" are his 2 favorite DVDs.  He watches them over and over.",1399161600,,184,3.6
8354312,4,B00279JW0Q,"As an athlete, especially enjoyed learning the sports psych aspects and what motivated and stifled the 2 arch rivals during the first 1/2 of the show.  The second 1/2 gets much softer on the rivalry aspect and focuses only on the surfing, so some may want to drop off once they see the relationship better reconciled.  Amazing footage of their talent throughout.",1355875200,,362,4.82258064516129

8354314,4,B00279JW0Q,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC ""OPEN UP YOUR FEELINGS"" DOC. Andy Irons and Kelly Slater....delving into their souls, voicing how they felt and thought of each other. Not kind and they let you know it...yet after all that....you gotta see this! Each time I watch it, I catch things said that I missed before. Who could NOT watch this? The surfing alone its unmistakable.",1301961600,,358,4.698412698412699
8354315,4,B00279JW0Q,"This gives a cool history of both Slater and B Irons, and their rivalry and friendship, but I felt like it was kind of an overview and did not give much back round into eithers evolution. It also did not have a ton of surfing clips, just snippits here and there, wish I could have seen whole sessions at their contests..",1299542400,,320,4.262295081967213
