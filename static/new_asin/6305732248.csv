I love HK action movies but don't waste your time watching this as there are much better movies out there.  If you insist on watching it, I suggest fast forwarding through and just watching the action sequences.",1324944000,,302,4.660377358490566
7893476,4,6305732248,"I heard of this movie through the 'coming attractions' list on the end of  the new Director's Cut DVD of 'Drive' by Steve Wang (Region 2 only,  sorry!). Get ready - a Hong Kong movie that has good plot, great characters  and depth. It's the perfect antidote to overblown, over-hyped  American/British films that take 3 hours and $3million to make a lot of  noise about nothing. Chiu Man Chuk (his Cantonese name) is Officer Dong,  transferred to the (fictional) Russian state of Lavernia for disobeying  orders while rescuing hostages. He meets up with his best mate Andrew who  takes life a little less seriously than he does. Dong is there five minutes  and manages to arrest the leading criminal in the subway, featuring the  first of many amazing fight sequences between the two. What follows is a  passionate tale of second chances, betrayal, heroes and friendship. A  quietly amazing film. The Honk Kong Legends Region 2 DVD has some real  goodies too - an interview with Chiu Man Chuk, his Wu Shu demonstration,  photo galleries, a music promo for the release, more coming attractions  from the distribution company, biographies and audio options. A few scenes  are grainy but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film,and the  sound is obviously great. It only comes in 2CH not 5.1 Dolby sound, but  hey, it still beats a VHS! WATCH THIS IN CANTONESE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES!  If you choose the dubbed version Officer Dong is American and it ruins the  whole style of the film.  Don't miss Chiu Man Chuk's performance - be ready  to put him on your list of top ten actors. What about the fact he doesn't  speak English? Well I don't speak Cantonese but there are less people in  the English-speaking world than there are in the Chinese dialects region!  Rent it, buy it, just get hold of it! At 87 minutes its well worth the  investment!",965520000,,1852,4.709375
