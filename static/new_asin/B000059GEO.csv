1404370,3,B000059GEO,I wish Dawn Dunlop had more of a role. It's too bad she didn't continue acting or take up modeling: she's beautiful!,1373846400,2,116,4.318181818181818
1404371,5,B000059GEO,"Fast delivery and Great quality. Its an old movie But, if you like Cars that are built in the Low Rider Style, then you are going to like this film.",1338163200,,148,3.966666666666667
1404372,5,B000059GEO,"Considering the ongoing racial controversy between Latinos and American society, this is one of the better statements (on film) ever made about a love affair between the two races.

Heather Locklear wanted the lead role in this film that eventually went to Dawn Dunlap, who was a star in another Roman Polanski film. That might be the one thing about this film that I wish was different, but it doesn't change the quality of the message being sent.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a modern-day (in the 80s) Romeo and Juliet.

If you want, you can grab it on Amazon's Createspace for a little less. createspace.___/219028  Use the code: ALLXKLKB for 10 percent off.",1242864000,2,677,4.760683760683761

Monarex Hollywood has a lot of films that cut deep like this one does.  I highly recommend it to anyone with a head on their shoulders... or anyone who just likes to watch good movies.",1159488000,2,644,4.672566371681416
1404374,1,B000059GEO,"I now realise why it was I could not remember this movie, other than the title at the dollar movies, (Low-riders Heartbreakers).

The only thing worth watching in this movie are the cars, when they cruise down the boulevard in their RANFLAS brings back so many memories. I remember hanging out watching the cars hop, scrape, and dance.

This movie just drags, and the music is bad. The people in charge of the music should have had their head examined, there was just no research. No oldies, no disco, no soul, not even a spanish song! just a generic rip off of Blondies Rapture and some other c-r-a-p, even their generic wannabe jazz is bad.

If you have to watch this rent it, or borrow it. If you must have it i'll sell you my copy cheep. Watch Boulevard Nights, American Me, Bound By Honor, Mi vida Loca, A million To Juan, Mi Familia, Zoot Suit, all these movies have better stories and plots.

 Another movie to stay away from is Lowrider Weekend.",1090713600,4,953,4.485549132947977
1404375,1,B000059GEO,"This is a streo type latino film. About cars and latinos with accents,and having no class. We all seen this before,even though the lead character seems to hav some good qualities. Apollonia which name is in front of the box is only in the movie for one minute,what a waste of money for Prince fans,this film is overly price. The film wa done in ealy 80's,since than we have seen better films with latinos.",1061078400,4,405,4.486486486486487
1404376,3,B000059GEO,"This is a real drive-in classic!  Fast, tricked out cars, a love interest, a power struggle, and even a wet-t-shirt contest.  The sound isn't great during the outdoor scenes, it sounds like the actors are in a vacuum.  The two things this movie has going for it is the all-latin cast, and the cars.  The plot, and acting are a little on the dry side.  All 'n' all though, it's not super bad movie, it's one of those, ""so bad, it's good"" type of flicks.  The VHS copy I viewed is very clear, and was recorded on a good quality tape in SP mode.",1015804800,5,542,4.163461538461538
