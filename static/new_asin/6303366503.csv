638234,4,6303366503,"Three Ages is often referred to as a parody of Griffith's Intolerance. However, a gap of seven years between the release of the two films makes this interpretation not as straightforward as it might at first appear. Moreover, Intolerance was something of a financial failure and it is far easier to parody a recent commercial success. There are similarities between the two films, but these should not be overemphasized, for whereas Griffith's film tells four very different stories, what distinguishes Keaton's film is that it tells three stories which in essence are the same. Keaton makes his point regarding the similar problems facing lovers through the ages by having them face the same recurring situations. The three stories resemble each other so closely that much of the humour of the film lies in the comparison between them. Thus Three Ages is not merely three short films spliced together. It is a far better and more unified film than that.
Many people seem to consider that Keaton was somehow merely practicing for his later triumphs when he made Three Ages. Granted it does not reach the heights of The General, but it should not be considered as some sort of minor piece of juvenilia. Keaton may not yet have been at his very best, but he could still make a film with many extremely funny and inventive moments.
Three Ages remains a highly enjoyable film, but it must be admitted that the print used for the DVD is quite poor. After watching near perfect prints on the other Keaton DVDs which Kino have released, one is left with a sense of regret that Three Ages did not survive in better condition. Still perhaps we are fortunate to be able to see the film at all. Keaton, at one point, told an interviewer that he thought the film was lost entirely.
Of the two short films included on the DVD The Goat is the best. Quite why it is called The Goat I'm not sure, but it is very funny and includes some hair-raising stunts which even Harold Lloyd might have balked at performing. It is said that My Wife's Relations reflects Keaton's relationship with his real wife's family, but this is to read back into the film problems which arose later than 1922. Keaton, at this point, was still happy with his wife Natalie Talmadge as is shown by her being given a starring role in the following year's Our Hospitality. My Wife's Relations should not then be viewed as autobiography, but rather as a fairly good comic farce. It has some fine scenes, but lacks the subtlety of Keaton's best films, for the supporting characters are really a series of grotesques.",985478400,5,2569,4.698447893569845
638235,5,6303366503,"THE THREE AGES (1923):  ""The Three Ages"" is the telling of 3 love stories, set at 3 different periods in history: Stone Age, Roman, and Present (1920's). All 3 stories have the same plot: innocent Buster is  competing for a girl who's also being wooed by a flashy rival, played by  Wallace Beery in a pre-fame role.  ""The Three Ages"" is Buster's  debut as a feature-length movie star.  Because it was his first try at the  big reels, he decided to tell 3 stories, so that if he was displeased with  the outcome, he could release the 3 stories as 2-reel shorts, the best of  which, I think, is the 1920's-period sequence.  ""The Three Ages""  worked out for him and was a hit when it was released, but I would not rank  it as high as the classic features he made in the future, such as ""The  General"" and ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."".  Still, it's fun to  watch, and has clever gags.
THE GOAT (1921):  Out of 35 Buster 2-reelers  I've seen, ""The Goat"" is my personal favorite.  One reason is  because Buster intentionally made himself look like a moron by opening  ""The Goat"" with a clever gag of himself getting into a long bread  line that happens to end in front of a male clothing store, outside of  which stand 2 mannequins that look like they're in the line, and which he  gets behind and thinks are real guys.  We see the line progressing towards  the bread-receiving window, but Buster stays stationary because, of course,  the mannequins are immobile. ""The Goat"" also includes the famous  ""bullseye"" scene of Buster sitting on the nose of a train that's  speeding directly towards the camera and stops just short of inches from  it.  ""The Goat"" contains some great street shots of Los Angeles  in 1921. In the far distance, you can see some slow horse and wagon  transportation eerily driving by, evidence that even in the early 1920's,  the U.S. hadn't fully made the transition to 100% automobile. On the night  I found out I wasn't getting promoted at my workplace, I decided it was  either the neck of a whiskey bottle or ""The Goat"" that I was  going to reach for.  I chose ""The Goat"".
MY WIFE'S RELATIONS  (1922): Charging him with a citizen's arrest, an old battleaxe brings  Buster before a judge - a polish-only speaking judge - who thinks they want  to get married.  The judge performs the ceremony in a language the 2 don't  understand, and they idiotically say ""yes"" to everything he asks  them.  Buster goes home to the shanty where his bride lives with her dad  and loser brothers, and they start brow-beating him right away.  Ho-hum...Buster makes the best of a bad situation. When the family  erroneously finds out that he's coming into an inheritance, they kiss his  you-know-what, until the end of this 2-reeler, when they find out he hasn't  got a dime, and go back to beating him up again. ""My Wife's  Relations"" is thought by Buster scholars to have been based on his  real-life domestic situation, involving his wife Natalie's famous actress  sisters and their overbearing mother.",959212800,5,3000,4.627862595419847
638236,4,6303366503,"For years, public domain copies of The Three Ages have relied on a far from complete, contrasty 16mm print suffering from a lot of neglect and nitrate decomposition.  The nicest thing about this DVD is Kino's greatest  gift to the cinemaphile--you actually can see the movie.  The pairing of  Keaton with Beery is ingenious -- they even keep their own names in the  ""Modern Story.""",953424000,5,381,4.8
638237,4,6303366503,"THE THREE AGES is Buster Keaton's parody of D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE.  Buster and Wallace Beery star as romantic rivals for the hand of pretty Margaret Leahy.  The twist is that the story is told thrice by intercutting  between three time periods: prehistoric, Ancient Rome, and Modern Times  (1920's).  The gags are fast and furious and many are truly surreal;  highlights include caveman Buster attempting to woo Amazonian Blanche  Payson, a Roman chariot race hindered by snow(!), and a beautifully  constructed chase sequence with Buster escaping from a police station and  inadvertantly returning there a few minutes later.  The Kino source print  has apparently been pieced together from the best available materials and  with a few minor exceptions is sharp and clear.  It also has a nicely done  music score conducted by Robert Israel. As a sidenote, many filmographies  list Oliver Hardy in the cast.  The actor in question is in fact a  near-Hardy lookalike named Kewpie Morgan.",950745600,3,991,5.210191082802548
638238,3,6303366503,"Well, The Goat is also one of Keaton's 4 or 5 best shorts-- a great Kafkaesque setup in which Keaton's picture is accidentally used for an escaped criminal and he can't figure out why everyone runs from him in  terror.",922060800,,218,4.45
7845379,5,6303366503,"THE THREE AGES

Buster Keaton and Wallace Beery vie for the same woman (Margaret Leahy) through three ages of world history: the Stone Age, the Roman Age, and the Modern Age.  This is a spoof on D.W. Griffiths monumental drama Intolerance which covered four ages of human history.

The Stone Age: Cute stop-motion animation sequence with Buster riding on a dinosaur done by Max Fleischer creator of Out of the Inkwell cartoons with Koko the Clown.

The Roman Age: Buster is in a lions den with the silliest looking lion of all time.  This works quite well in this film.

The Modern Age:  Buster scores a touchdown!  During filming Buster came up short on an eighteen-foot building to building jump and hit the wall of the other building landing into a safety net. 1923, 63 minutes

THE GOAT

Highly intelligent murderer Dead Shot Dan sees to it that Busters picture is used for his mug shot.  Buster is now thought to be an escaped killer.  He pursues the police chiefs daughter while the police chief pursues him!  1921, 23 minutes

MY WIFES RELATIONS

Busters lack of Polish has him married to a woman he doesnt know.  He has problems with her family until he inherits some money.  1922, 25 minutes

Three Ages does have some quality issues but not too bad.  I didn't like the music of My Wifes Relations.  Altogether there is just too much comical material on this disc to not recommend it to everyone.",1415318400,,1405,4.611336032388664

7845381,4,6303366503,"Buster Keaton (1895-1966) was one of the great silent comics, particularly known for his amazing pratfalls and deadpan expression. In 1920 Keaton starred in the feature-length film THE SAPHEAD, but Keaton was ambitious and wanted the same degree of control enjoyed by Charlie Chaplin. On his next feature film he would star, write, produce, and direct. The resulting film was 1923'S THREE AGES.

In theory, THREE AGES is a spoof on Griffith's legendary INTOLERANCE, a film that intercuts several stories from different historical eras, and it is true that Keaton's THREE AGES does much the same. The first story is set in the stone age, the second in ancient Rome, the third in modern America, and all three work together to make a cohesive statement. But Keaton's motives may have had less to do with INTOLERANCE than with the box office. Although he was still an unknown quantity in feature films, his short movies were very popular, and if THREE AGES failed the three stories could be re-edited and re-released independently. It didn't happen: THREE AGES was a success just as it was, and Keaton would go to much more ambitious, elaborate, and memorable works in the future.

The conceit is a clever one. In each story Margaret Leahy plays a beauty who is pursued by love-lorn Buster Keaton and ruffian Wallace Beery--and Leahy's parents, Joe Roberts and Lillian Lawrence, prefer Beery. The result are a series of chases and battles that are astonishingly clever. Keaton rides a dinosaur, is dragged by a mammoth, and engages in a prehistoric rock-throwing battle; finds himself in a Ben-Hur-like chariot race and a lion's den in ancient Rome; and runs riot on the football field in modern America--all to win his lady love. The picture is fairly good, the music is pleasant and inventive, and although I wouldn't put THREE AGES on the same page with Keaton's SHERLOCK JR. or THE GENERAL, it is still a lot of fun to watch.

The DVD includes two Keaton shorts as well: the 1921 THE GOAT and the 1922 MY WIFE'S RELATIONS. In the first, Keaton is mistaken for a dangerous prison escapee; in the second he is accidentally married to brutish woman with a brutish family. Both are charming, but of the two THE GOAT is the more enjoyable, a non-stop chase that is funny as only Keaton can make it. Again, the picture is good and the music pleasant, and both--especially THE GOAT--are worth a watch. Recommended to silent fans.

7845382,3,6303366503,"I'd have to rate this as slightly above-average Keaton fare. It shows Buster trying to romance the girl away from Wallace Beery, and what would have transpired if the story had taken place in (1) the Stone Age; (2) The Roman Age, and (3) The Modern Age.

I liked them in that order, too, with more laughs with the older periods of time, although I laughed the hardest at a couple of segments in the Roman Age. My favorite was the chariot race held in the sand. That had a number of clever things.  The brief bit with the lion was funny, too, sort of a parody of the Biblical story of Daniel in the lion's den.

They were smart only going five minutes or so with each age and then going back with the story each time. Each ""age"" had four or five segments in total.

Nothing hilarious but definitely worth your time if you are checking out silent film comedies",1243555200,,858,4.277777777777778
7845383,4,6303366503,"You needn't have seen Griffith's INTOLERANCE to appreciate what Keaton does here.  This isn't really a parody of INTOLERANCE.  Keaton simply borrowed Griffith's idea of exploring a theme or idea in different historic ages.  The theme here is Romantic Love & the three ages are:  Stone, Roman & Modern.  Keaton's sweetheart through the ages is Margaret Leahy & his rival is Wallace Beery.  There are wonderful bits throughout the movie.  I especially like his travel by dinosaur, his caveman foot gear (which shows up in every comedy with cave men) & a chariot race that seems a parody of the one in BEN-HUR except this one came first.  There is a restaurant scene in the Modern Age in which the Rival goes off to pay the bill & the Sweetheart decides to 'fix her face'.  Once, sitting in a movie theatre what Keaton does next caused the woman to my left to laugh so violently I thought I was going to sustain an injury.  It's a lovely movie.",1182816000,,941,4.5476190476190474
7845384,4,6303366503,"Keaton's first feature-lenght film is a funny revision of three historic periods ( the stone age, the roman empire and the 20th century ) that at time can be seen as a parody of Griffith's "" Intolerance "". Keaton combines creatively scenes of the mentioned ages following the same analogical scheme than Griffith's masterpiece, but inversely to "" Intolerance "" here the misadventures of true love is the leitmotive of all the three "" stories "" and the emphatic and dramatic look of Griffith changes for Keaton's comic disaffectation . This operation, for other part, can be understand as a symptom of Keaton's care in his purpose to jump into a most ambitious production, since "" The three ages "" are in fact three shorts, this is, three variations around a same story put in one feature. The movie has ups and downs ( the next would be his first masterpiece  "" Our hospitality ), but although "" The three ages "" is far inferior than his later filmworks as director it has many splendid isolated sight-gags as that one with Keaton's driving a Ford that falls into pieces when he tries to cross a pathole ( it's not hard to imagine how Henry Ford received this commentary ) and turns out to be in all of its parts very amusing. Wallace Beery plays the role of Keaton's eternal rival. A Keaton's minor piece, but Keaton's signature is always a guarantee of fine artwork.

This DVD also contains Keaton's shorts: "" The goat ""( 1920 ), an hilarious slapstick farce with Keaton in the role of a man falsely accused, and "" My wife's relations"" ( 1920 ), a delicious satire of marriage-life.",1160265600,,1584,4.593639575971731
7845385,5,6303366503,"Whether you're new to the work of Buster Keaton or exploring ways to complete your Keaton library you can't go wrong with this set. It contains his first feature length film as a director (Three Ages) and two shorts films, The Goat and My Wife's Relations. The editors of this set selected a good blend of Keaton themes and approaches to story-telling here. The Goat is the earliest of the set but is in some ways it is the perfect distillation of his character: a drifter, a victim of fate, machine and human will who somehow avoids disaster and even, surprisingly, wins the girl. Buster becomes falsely identified as an escaped criminal, chased continuously by cops, eventually exploiting his predicament by flashing the newspaper containing his mug shot to folks who want to give him a hard time. The climax is a great chase scene involving an elevator and set of stairs as Buster tries to rendezvous with his beloved who happens to be the daughter of the cop who has been pursuing him for most of the film! This film is simply unmatched as a spontaneous sequence of creative visual comedy.

My Wife's Relations (1922) is less satisfying because it strays from the best Keaton formula and degrades into a more purely slapstick genre. It is much more suggestive of the kind of film Buster did with Fatty Arbuckle 3 or 4 years previously; funny, creative, but more primitive and less satisfying to the modern viewer. It contains elements that are untypical of Keaton's character, such as physical violence towards a woman (not that the bully character of Keaton's wife did not deserve such abuse here!)

Finally, Three Ages is pure joyful visual comedy. It is a comic parody of Grittith's Intolerance, where the same theme is explored over three different historical periods. Here is the theme is love (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy defeats rival and wins girl back) and the three ages are pre-historic, roman and modern (1920s); there are unlimited comic opportunities being explored here, as love and life are compared and contrasted. The energetic, optimistic mood is somewhat uncharacteristic of Keaton's films and more suggestive of Harold Lloyd, as Keaton's character overcomes bully obstacles with almost super-human skill and dexterity. In fact, the football game sequence looks forward to Lloyd's The Freshman, and the rescue of the girl from the polygamist predates Lloyd's Girl Shy. (Both Keaton and Lloyd were approaching their peek creatively during this period, and it's obvious that they played off each other's creative skills.)

By all means, buy this volume, whether alone or as part of the complete set.",1145836800,2,2629,4.970454545454546
7845386,5,6303366503,"Keaton's Three Ages is one of his lesser works, but it shows the same attention to detail that would be so praised in his best-known work, The General. Keaton's comedy is so matter-of-fact that whenever he does a gag, it appears to make perfect sense to the viewer. If his Roman character is in a chariot race, and one of the dogs is lame, then of course he will stop, examine the dog, take a spare dog from a box on the back of the chariot, and exchange them!

My Wife's Relations does indeed reflect the tensions occurring in Keaton's married life at that time. He married Natalie Talmadge because she wanted to get married, and Buster seemed a likely prospect (I am quoting from various Keaton biographies here). The fact that he cast Natalie as the leading lady in Our Hospitality does not mean that they were getting along, but that he wanted to placate her. Keaton, who lived uneasily with his wife's relations, made the film as a way of complaining about his in-laws without actually voicing his complaints. The film is a bitingly funny one.

The Goat (in other words, scapegoat) is yet another fantastically funny short in which Keaton is a victim of fate. His sense of comedy was far beyond that of Chaplin or Lloyd, which is why it stands up so well today.",1108598400,3,1266,4.524017467248909
7845387,4,6303366503,"This is one of the Bus Man's lesser known, but certainly not lesser works.
Three Ages is a tad jarring at first, because the three tales of romance mix ups criscross between the Flinstonic era (haha), Ancient Rome, and the Roaring 20s. Even if you don't usually like romatic comedy, the Bus man's personality and brilliant comic timing will make you smile and laugh. I'm not really sure if our man is actually being dragged by an elephant in the caveman scenes, but the lion he deals with in the Roman segment is obviously fake. The pre-Lost world animated segments of the Bus man riding the dinosaur is impressing and amusing even for modern audiences.
In either case, while this isn't exactly a knee-slapper, it's certainly an amusing and pleasant way to spend an hour and a half, as well as the shorts.",1089590400,,805,4.636363636363637
7845388,4,6303366503,"THREE AGES is one movie told in three parts.  The first section takes place during prehistoric times, showing us Caveman Buster's (riding around on his special-effect dinosaur) attempts to woo cavewomen.  The second part is set during the height of the Roman Empire, while the third is contemporary (well, it's set in the then-current 1920s, which means now it almost qualifies as historic).  The movie follows the course of love, giving us a typical example of courtship (meeting the parents, jealousy, etc) and how that situation would unfold in each time period.  Naturally, many of the jokes come from seeing how much things haven't changed.
In the historical time periods, much of the humor is derived from having anachronisms in the form of modern conveniences: the Caveman Keaton plays golf with a huge rock club, and the Roman Keaton has a sundial watch.  It's a pity that these sort of gags would be endlessly ripped off in later films, as it does take a little of the shine off them here.  Still, what may not seem fresh anymore nonetheless remains amusing.
I liked this movie even though there isn't too much in the way of Keaton's noted physical comedy.  There are a few jokes that rely on him bouncing in and out of things, but to a far lesser extent than usual.  There are some impressively large-scale sequences (I'm thinking of the rock battle, the chariot race, and the football game) that had me grinning.  This is a film that is more amusing than it is laugh-out-loud hilarious.
Also included are two short films: THE GOAT and MY WIFE'S RELATIONS.
THE GOAT contains two staples of the short films of this era.  Jokes about being hungry, and people running away from the police as fast as they can.  Keaton finds himself in what could almost be described as a preview for another short film he would complete the following year, COPS.  In both films, Keaton begins by minding his own business, but then accidentally running afoul of the police.  He must run quickly to avoid arrest, while devising neat ways of eluding his would-be captors.  He eventually gets confused for the infamous escaped criminal, Dead Shot Dan, and finds himself wanted, dead or alive.  Misdirection and near misses are the order of the day, as Buster becomes increasingly frantic in his escape attempts.  This is really my favorite kind of Buster Keaton short film: Buster running frantically through city streets, using every kind of transportation he can to get away from someone.
In MY WIFE'S RELATIONS, Keaton finds himself (after a mix-up at City Hall) married to an enormous Irish-Catholic woman and her enormous Irish-Catholic family.  There isn't too much to say about this one.  Keaton, a WASP, tries to survive in an immigrant/ethnic family.  Naturally, by the end of the twenty minutes, he's engaged in a pitched battle against an outraged group of people he hadn't even met at the beginning.  The back of the DVD casing claims this film ""reflects some of the tensions between Keaton and the Talmadges, his real-life in-laws"", which is a bizarre claim (and one I've seen contradicted).  Did Keaton's in-laws really pelt him with bricks, and would he exit their house by wrapping up in a carpet and rolling down the stairs?
The THREE AGES DVD contains three films, which at their worst are merely amusing, and at their best are hilarious.  THE GOAT is by far the best that this has to offer, but THREE AGES and MY WIFE'S RELATIONS definitely have their moments.  It's a pity that the picture quality isn't terrific, but when the material is over eighty years old, one can't afford to be picky.",1074902400,,3597,4.803571428571429
