Amazon should be embarassed to sell this item<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlemagne-Holy-Barbarian/dp/B001E6V4O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlemagne: Holy Barbarian</a>",1335225600,10,367,7.488372093023256
8296913,5,B001E6V4O0,"I watched this video (on vhs obviously) in about 1995.... and it was HILARIOUS.  My friends and I used to act out parts of it because the acting is SO HORRIBLE.  I mean, I will give credit where its due... it's a great educational reproduction of Charlemagne but its also quite funny... the acting is , well, interesting.

Either way I'm glad its there and it will be fun to watch with my friends if I can convince them to shell out this much money for a dvd.  Seems a bit rediculous for $60.  How many sales can you possibly get ? How's about lowering the price a bit?",1280793600,10,569,4.18348623853211
