7210196,5,B00YAZNBDE,"IM NO DUMMY Two Disc set is a great reason to continue buying DVDs with its four hours of entertainment for the price of a movie ticket.  The 90-minute documentary is so good it will leave you wanting more, and there is more with the amazing extras.  All the big names in modern ventriloquism are here such as Jeff Dunham, Jay Johnson, and Terry Fator with hilarious routines and great insight into this often misunderstood art form. Youll love the comedy clips and the peek inside this comedy genre. My son watched it over and over ever since I purchased it and finds it very funny.  I also enjoyed the fascinating section on the Vent Haven Museum, the only museum in the world dedicated to the art of ventriloquism.  The doc is humorous, clever, surprising and informative; and the hours of extras and directors commentary really make this a great buy.",1443312000,6,854,4.635761589403973
7210197,2,B00YAZNBDE,"This edition was  intended to be far less entertaining than informative. If you are interested in the history of ventriloquism, this is for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for entertainment, I think you will be disappointed. I was.",1443225600,3,242,4.761904761904762
7210198,5,B00YAZNBDE,"I was lucky to have seen this film originally at the Seattle International Film Festival. It was truly a wonderful adventure into the art of ventriloquism. NOW ,in the two disc new release, it is even better! The director's commentary gives you even more eye opening and entertaining information about the true art of ventriloquism. PLUS the second disc has more footage including a interview with Terry Fator, winner of America's Got Talent , who wasn't in the first version and more about Vent Haven Museum. Still entertaining and full of belly laughing moments, it's great and well worth the price!",1442707200,6,601,4.96039603960396
7210199,5,B00YAZNBDE,"Wow. What can I say? I originally purchased the first edition of this DVD when it was released in 2009 and thought it was the finest video documentary on the history and art of ventriloquism ever produced. It told the stories of the great ventriloquists of the past AND current professionals.

Now comes along director Bryan W. Simon's newly re-released ""I'm No Dummy"" 2 DVD set. It contains even more wonderful, funny and insightful history behind this amazing art form. The second bonus disc is jammed packed with over 2 full hours of additional content and clips - an in-depth interview with America's Got Talent Season 2 winner, Terry Fator, fantastic inside stories of some of the most popular ""dummies"" at the only museum in the world dedicated to the art of ventriloquism - Vent Haven, more great footage on the career of legendary vent Jimmy Nelson, hilarious out takes of Jay Johnson, a clip of Jay's Tony Award winning Broadway one-man show, and so much more.

The bonus disc could have been released as a stand alone DVD and been worth the price of this set.

A total of 3 1/2 hours on how modern era ventriloquism entertainment began, where it is today and it's truly bright future.

Beautifully shot and edited, this is a true piece of history that you should own if you have even the slightest interest in this fascinating craft we call ventriloquism. If I could give this 6 stars, I would! Get a copy. I can guarantee you'll watch it more than once!",1442620800,5,1464,4.640926640926641
7210200,5,B00YAZNBDE,"I've loved ""I'm No Dummy"" since it first came out. Now rereleased with over 2 hours of extras, Bryan Simon's masterpiece is even more enlightening, revealing, and entertaining. You don't have to be a ventriloquist to enjoy this film. You just have to love great comedy! However, you will be a DUMMY if you miss out.

7210201,5,B00YAZNBDE,"I purchased the original Im No Dummy documentary when it was released. At the Vent Haven ConVENTion I had the opportunity to purchase a special preview copy of the new Two Disc Limited Edition. I didn't hesitate and I wasn't disappointed. The two hours of additional material are entertaining, informative and insightful. Most importantly, this version offers insight into the creativity behind todays most successful and hilarious ventriloquists. The extra interviews and performance footage alone make this a worthwhile purchase. But I especially enjoyed the additional background on ventriloquists and puppets that are represented at Vent Haven Museum. If you own the original edition, youll relish this version even more.",1441411200,9,725,5.6

If you homeschool and are doing a unit study on Puppetry absolutely add this video to the unit study! I own it on DVD AND have it for my iPad as one of the movies I carry with me when I travel. I find myself noticing new elements each time I view the film. The clips of both old ventriloquists and modern greats are wonderfully entertaining. Charming, interesting, and amusing in turns, I was sorry when it ended. The extra footage with the DVD is well worth the time to watch. Love it!",1495756800,3,650,4.166666666666667
