2465338,5,B000CIXIAE,"If you are a fan of the original Australian Kath & Kim, The Games, or the original The Office, you should love this series! It's a mockumentary that deals with five Aussies as they strive to be awarded ""Australian of the Year"".  In America, it was briefly seen on Sundance Channel as ""The Nominees"" a couple year ago. It's subtle, brilliant humor that gets funnier as you get to know the characters more and more. And dare I say, you may shed a tear by the end! Highest recommendation!

One important note, the box and disc say ""PAL"", but I was able to play this just fine on my non-modified American Xbox360. Haven't tried a normal DVD player.",1236816000,10,644,4.4491525423728815
2465339,5,B000CIXIAE,"funny, witty, clever, and at times heart felt.  I adored the show.  Also see Summer Heights High!  Loved it!",1215388800,,108,4.578947368421052
2465340,5,B000CIXIAE,"If you find the following programs funny, at all, you will deeply enjoy this wonderful series from Chris Lilley, who's virtually unknown here in the US.
1. Seinfeld
2. Larry Sanders
3. Curb Your Enthusiasm
4. Spinal Tap/Best in Show/Guffmann, etc.
5. SCTV
6. The Office
7. Little Britain
8. The League of Gentlemen
You get my drift.
Chris has created five (or more accurately six, as one has a twin) alter egos, all vying for the coveted title of ""Australian of the Year"". Here in US the show is called ""The Nominees"". I don't know if the video is available in US format, but it should be.
Lilley is a huge talent. Two of the finalists are women, but it's virtually impossible to tell that from Chris' performances. These portraits are mercilessly funny, even to the point of cruelty. The situations he puts the characters in are devastatingly painful, but he is able to do it with razor-sharp accuracy and believability.
The world needs to know about Chris Lilley.",1198627200,3,965,4.682352941176471
2465341,5,B000CIXIAE,mockumentary about Australian of the year - all played by one character -  very funny and irreverant. - very reno 911 humor.,1182470400,,124,4.636363636363637
2465346,3,B000CIXIAE,"I was expecting a lot more fun, raw humor.  Instead after watching two shows, we will just have to bear with the rest.  Chris Lilley is great and Angry Boys is great.  Watch that first and his later work.  Maybe we will enjoy the later shows in this series if we get to them.",1391385600,,275,4.037037037037037
2465347,5,B000CIXIAE,I bought this DVD because i love the Summer hights high and this one is funny as . I was scared at first because i was not sure it would work on my dvd player but if you just buy the USA one region 1 it works perfect.,1390435200,,217,3.5416666666666665
2465348,5,B000CIXIAE,Anything Chris Lilley does is great!  Stumbled on Angry Boys on my Rocu.  Not knowing what it was I thought I would give it a try.  Ended up with a marathon weekend of unbelievable humour and acting skills!.  I didn't know he starred as so many of the personalities.  Instant fan!  Im not one to buy boxed sets as one viewing for most shows is enough.  However this is an exception.  Once is not enough!  Getting all of his works.  Insane comedy!,1389657600,,446,4.329268292682927
2465349,5,B000CIXIAE,"Love Chris Lilley's brand of humor, it's so amazing to me how Chris Lilley always manages to move me with all of the different characters he plays.",1388102400,,147,4.481481481481482
2465350,4,B000CIXIAE,"I loved We can be Heroes. It was a short season though. I expected more for the price I paid, but I don't regret the purchase. I preferred some of Chris Lilley's other work over this though.",1387065600,,190,4.162162162162162
2465351,5,B000CIXIAE,"I saw this show a number of years back when it was a miniseries on the Sundance Channel in the United States. I fell in love. For years, I searched for the DVDs so I could force my friends to watch it. I have forced about ten people to watch it now: half of whom demanded that we watch every episode ASAP, and the other half liked it a lot but didn't have time for a Chris Lilley Marathon.

If you like dry humor and get bored with television shows after ten episodes or so, then you might like this. I know I do!",1366675200,,513,3.9326923076923075
2465352,4,B000CIXIAE,This guy is a comic genius .  So many characters and each one so different.  You forget that Chris Lilley is playing them  al!!!.  Just make sure you buy the DVD made for North America .  We has to watch it on our computer as it would not play in our DVD player.,1360540800,,262,3.8679245283018866
2465353,5,B000CIXIAE,I thought it was a great program. I would highly suggest it to anyone who enjoys mockumentaries or Australians in general.,1358640000,,122,4.857142857142857
2465354,5,B000CIXIAE,"Wish I had been able to catch this years ago!!  Chris Lilley breathes so much life into his characters.  Though they are quite funny, they do tug at your heart strings at times.",1355961600,,177,4.333333333333333
2465355,4,B000CIXIAE,I am a huge fan of Summer Heights High and We Can Be Heroes didn't quite match up. It was still entertaining and Chris Lilley is insanely talented but I didn't enjoy it as much.,1355702400,,177,4.085714285714285
2465356,5,B000CIXIAE,"Yeah, it only works on my Mac because its not compatible with my PS3 or DVD player, but its Chris Lilley so it still gets 5 stars:)",1341446400,,131,3.888888888888889
2465357,3,B000CIXIAE,"We Can Be Heroes is another great series from Chris Lilley.  Personally, I found it a bit short, being only 6 episodes long.  Though I liked Angry Boys better, We Can Be Heroes was a good way to spend an afternoon.  The item shipped ridiculously quickly; I received it 3 days after placing my order.  I played it on my MacBook, and had no issues watching the DVD.  After I got it, I must admit I was a tad disappointed, only because the series was so short and I spent nearly $50 on it.  I would have been okay paying $25 for it, but after watching it I am definitely dissatisfied with the price I paid for it.",1330732800,7,610,4.127118644067797
2465358,3,B000CIXIAE,"DVD can only be played on my Apple computer.  This Aussie DVD won't play in a USA DVD player.

When viewed -- very funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1326844800,,138,4.708333333333333
2465359,1,B000CIXIAE,"DVD is Regionally Restricted and will not play on USA players.  NO response from CD Importers, a TERRIBLE online buying experience.",1325721600,4,131,5.238095238095238
2465360,5,B000CIXIAE,"I absolutely loved it. If you loved Summer Heights High, you can experience even more of Chris Lilley's brilliance in ""We Can Be Heroes"". How he manages to bring six different charactes to life, is genuis.....",1285891200,,209,4.833333333333333
2465361,5,B000CIXIAE,"If you're a fan of SHH, you'll love this. This was his show before SHH and has his early version of Ja'mie in it. Its wonderful and hilarious. These characters are all so different and unique. Only knock is I wish he made more episodes but leave them wanting more I guess and he plays everyone so that's got to be consuming.",1266192000,,324,4.241935483870968
2465362,5,B000CIXIAE,"Australian Chris Lilley's six characters- Phil Olivetti (a retired policeman who flaunts the fact he saved 9 children from a jumping castle disaster), Ricky Wong (young Chinese physics phd student who really wants to be an actor), Ja'mie King (spoiled private high school girl), Pat Mullins (first female competitive rolling champion with a leg disability), and Daniel Sims (first human to donate his ear drum to his nearly deaf twin brother who Lilley also showcases as Nathan Sims) all set the stage for 3 hours of awkward, hysterical, painful, heart wrenching, and again, hysterical scenarios. But what is most attractive and captivating about 'We Can Be Heroes' is Lilley's ability to be simultaneously convincing as these people and at the same time, self-deprecating through the characters' personal interviews and interactions with the supporting cast. Definitely recommend for Summer Heights High fans and the Office (British and American). And don't worry- The Special Edition DVD labeled ""Region 0"" or ""Region: All"" works on most American DVD players.

Can't wait for his next project, 'Angry Little Men'!",1265587200,,1115,5.371428571428571
2465363,5,B000CIXIAE,"If you like Summer Heights High you will love this. Chris Lilley is amazingly funny. J'aime returns and many new characters are introduced, there is even a sad bit at the end to keep you honest. We need more from this funny/insightful man.",1257552000,,239,4.5813953488372094
2465364,5,B000CIXIAE,This is one of the funniest things I've ever watched. I loved Summer Heights High and heard about We Can Be Heroes from an Australian friend. I couldn't stop watching. Chris is absolutely brilliant as Ricky Wong and Pat Mullins. His mannerisms and speech patterns are perfection. I can't wait to see his next project.,1252972800,10,317,4.781818181818182
2465365,4,B000CIXIAE,"We really enjoyed this video.  We are so hooked on Chris Lilley we had to get a new DVD player so we could watch videos like this from other countries since it won't play on a U.S. player.  We will admit the only reason it didn't get the 5 stars was because we liked Summer Heights High better but there are some really great scenes in this one, too.",1247529600,,350,4.057971014492754

8099101,2,B000CIXIAE,"So far, I am giving this 2-3 stars.  I have only seen the first 3 episodes.  I bought the DVD, but recognized immediately, within the first 5 minutes, that I am watching the same person; then I picked up the cover, looked at it more carefully, and confirmed that quite quickly.

In the first 3 episodes, which is all I have seen, I did not laugh once.  I nearly laughed at something in the second episode.

If I am finding that I don't like a movie, or a series, I consider, maybe I am not the target audience and maybe there is an audience out there that might appreciate it.  At first, I thought that that this series might be appropriate for kids--say ages 10-14.  So, in the 2nd and 3rd episode, I began to pay attention to the language.  Although I do not recall profanity (using God's name casually), I do recall a lot of swearing.  The f-word was used a number of times; and sh*t was a common word.  Also, giving the finger was something I observed a number of times.  I did not notice any strong sexual references; but I am only 3 episodes in (and I don't know that I will watch the entire series).

Personally, I am sorry that I bought this DVD and recommend that if you can find the first episode on YouTube, watch that first before buying this online.",1499299200,,1262,4.2784810126582276
8099102,5,B000CIXIAE,It's hilarious,1466553600,,14,6.5
8099103,5,B000CIXIAE,"This is possibly the best mockumentary series out there! Chris Lilly's sense of humor is spot on. His ability to impersonate people from very different backgrounds is incredible. The DVD's came as described and do not work on standard US dvd player, but does work on my computer.",1461628800,,279,4.833333333333333

8099105,5,B000CIXIAE,Absolutely funny.  You will not stop laughing throughout all episodes!,1439424000,,70,6.0
8099106,3,B000CIXIAE,Not the best of Chris Lilley's comedy. But still...it's Chris Lilley,1434499200,,68,5.2727272727272725
