7880690,5,6305026041,"I got a lot more out of this film than I expected. Not only is it an edge of the seat thriller, but it's also deep, thought-provoking, and touches a raw nerve on feelings about life and death for people with any terminal illness. Its portrayal of Cystic Fibrosis was a genuine effort, and almost believable at times, and this is coming from someone with the disease. I found myself caring for all three of the major characters, and feeling terrified at the fate I knew was inevitably coming to them.  I thought it was beautifully written, and had a unique artistic vision. I recommend it to anyone who has any personal connection with CF, or to anyone who just enjoys dramas or thrillers that are complex, twisted, or out of the ordinary.",1284940800,4,738,4.548872180451128
7880691,3,6305026041,"I didn't think Last Breath was a particularly good movie. What could have been a really gripping drama film with los of emotion ending up being a boring and somewhat generic movie.

It's about a man who has to save his dying wife because she has a rare blood disease, so the husband goes around trying to contact people who happen to have the same rare blood type in the slim hope they can provide blood to save the wife.

Well, the story actually comes across rather poorly because Luke Perry's character wasn't very good (or convincing) as someone who was deeply concerned about his wife. I don't know whether it's his character that just stinks, the poor writing of the film, poor storytelling, or what exactly went wrong here.

The movie's not without its twists, some of which are decent, which is why the movie gets a decent rating overall from me (and not a BAD rating).

Luke Perry's acting wasn't very believable to me though, and kind of ruined what could have been a movie that brought people searching for tissues and really attaching them to the storyline and feeling emotion for the wife. Luke's acting skills in this film were rather weak if you ask me.

Not a bad movie, but nowhere near a classic either.",1251849600,,1221,4.557077625570776

7880695,5,6305026041,"This movie is one of the most realistic dramas dealing with a serious disease and its effect on the protagonists' lives.  Not only is it nail-biting suspense, it is an unusual kind of love story.  (And you will  DEFINITELY be surprised at the ending!!)",914198400,10,252,4.681818181818182
