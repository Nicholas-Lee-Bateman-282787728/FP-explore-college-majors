8134348,3,B000FL5YQO,"The picture quality is good, but I was very disappointed in the product because of the lack of ability to select a track to view, or to move around on the dvd. It has none of the index or tracking features associated with a true dvd. It was obviously copied from some other format such as vhs.  However, unlike vhs, you cannot move ahead or go back to a certain performance.  You can only view from beginning to end, every time. If you have a favorite star skating 9th, you must watch all eight of the preceding performances first. Unbelievable!!

  Two of the three ""videos"" are less than an hour long.  The third is just over one hour. Very disappointing. Also, I would have preferred to see more stars skate at least once instead of encore performances by some stars.",1168646400,9,770,4.464285714285714
