8158369,3,B000KNISOC,"After having just watched this movie/documentary, I want to share my opinion. I acknowledge that what is said is true, but what dissapoints me is the utter materialistic and superficial angle it promotes.

After having studied Anthroposophy, Theosophy, Gnosis, comparative Mythology, Philosophy and Religion I feel that this secret is just the first step in Self-Knowledge, the very basics. It's too bad that the producers did not include more esoteric information.

I don't think that this is ""THE secret"", kept from the public because it is common sense, anyone who is mature knows ""this secret"". There are far more greater secrets that we should be aware of, like the mysteries of Kaballah, and Alchemy for instance.

For me, this movie didn't show me anything new, and I am not facincated by the hype, don't be either. There's so MUCH MORE than the Law of Attraction, Success and Well-Being, although they are extremely vital and important.

I want to let whoever reads this that one can find more substance and deeper wisdom in such authors as: Madamme Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, Manly P. Hall, Edouard Schure, Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and my favorite, Samael Aun Weor.

-I also want to also let you know that there is another DVD that just came out by Thelema Press (their first) that truly and profoundly reaveals for the first time a real secret. The most important, unknown and major factor in human life, the mysteries of Man and Woman...the Mysteries of Sex. One can find it here on amazon entitled ""SEX: THE SECRET GATE TO EDEN"".",1170806400,12,1538,4.922779922779923
8158370,5,B000KNISOC,"This was recommended by a friend who is a highly successful businessman and a Christian.  He has always practiced this method of aligning thoughts with positive thinking, and focused on God as the Universal Power.  After watching the online version from the website ($4.95) I was blown away and purchased the DVD so that my teenagers could watch it.  It's a wonderful way to live and completely transforms the way you think about your life and your situation, no matter what it is.  I would recommend purchasing the DVD off the website, as it is cheaper than anywhere else. Sorry Amazon.",1170633600,7,587,4.782178217821782
8158371,4,B000KNISOC,"Ardently endorsed by such diverse people as ELLEN DEGENERES (who credits the message of ""The Secret"" and ""The Law of Attraction"" with all of her recent life successes and comeback) and LARRY KING. Many other names you know, in such realms as business, finance, advertising, lobbying, law, film, politics, sports, medicine, science, publishing and media, follow these principles but avoid endorsing them publicly in order to stay clear of criticism and debate in the public at large.

OPRAH WINFREY, in discussing on her show how she brings her dreams and aspirations into reality, said that she gets a clear idea/vision of what she wants and then brings herself into ""alignment"" with it. This is the principle underlying ""the secret"" and the ""law of attraction."" The process, in a nutshell, is as follows: (i) get a very clear idea/vision of what you want; (2) bring yourself into ""alignment"" with it - (a) attach to it a very ""high"" emotion -e.g., joy, love, enthusiasm - and really feel this every time you think about it, (b) focus on your goal frequently (once or several times throughout the day, with your full attention - in an easy and relaxed manner, in a healthy and positive way, with every confidence of a good outcome), and (c) envision/visualize/imagine with every sense you have (see it, hear it, feel it, smell it, taste it - run a ""virtual reality"" in your head of yourself having and living with the very thing or condition you want); and (3) ""let it in"" - be open to receive the results you want (aka, the ""law of allowing"").

IMPORTANT: As much as possible avoid all negative thoughts and desires about what you want, or feelings of desperation or stress or impatience, as such thoughts and feelings merely invoke the law of attraction against the very outcome you desire.

Also, frame your want or intention in the POSITIVE - what you DO want, rather than what you DON'T - for example, intend to have perfect HEALTH, rather than intending to be free of DISEASE or ""not SICK"", or intend to have FINANCIAL ABUNDANCE, rather than focusing on being out of DEBT""). The forces you intend to harness or invoke don't process the ""not"" or ""no"" or ""negative"", but rather attach only to the subject (capitalized in the foregoing examples), with the result that an intention/desire framed in the negative will bring the very opposite of what you want - this is the main reason so many of our intentions fail - we focus on what we DON'T want, because that's what is bringing us the discomfort or unhappiness we're trying to escape, rather than focusing on what we DO want.

The above is just a very basic intro, but can take you a long way. This is a revelation to all of us who truly believed we were ""positive thinkers"" and spiritual beings, but felt that something fell short or was missing.

Buy this DVD as a launchpad into discovering the untapped power you have to realize your dreams (not only for money, although wherewithal is certainly key to realizing any dream)- and possibly to begin to discover and realize your life purpose and true potential.

Those who ""get"" the message of this DVD understand that it is in no way at odds with any religion, except to the extent that each claims to have ""all of the answers"" to the exclusion of all others. The teaching is intended to help the viewer tap into the power of God in the universe, and deepen the individual connection to God.

A new age is dawning. Read Wayne Dyer, John Gray, Barbara Marciniak, Sanaya Roman & Duane Packer, Deepak Chopra, Jerry & Esther Hicks (aka Abraham-Hicks), Neil Donald Walsh, Michael Losier, Lynne McTaggart, Eckhart Tolle, Napoleon Hill, Lynn Grabhorn, Joe Dispenza, Marianne Williamson, Fred Alan Wolf, Richard Gerber, Robert T. Kiyosaki (the list goes on and on, and includes authors from a vast range of disciplines). Watch ""What the Bleep - Down the Rabbit Hole,"" which demonstrates connections to quantum physics, astronomy, medicines and other disciplines. Google ""law of attraction,"" ""deliberate creation"" and ""Steve Pavlina."" There is a growing body of research showing that habits of thinking actually affect the hard-wiring of the brain and neurochemicals it produces. Huge advances are being made in energy medicine. Molecular biology studies are revealing that thought impacts cells and atoms. Cosmic observations reveal that thoughts, which vibrate at different frequencies determined by their emotional content, create energy obervable energy fields in the earth's atmosphere.

The Secret requires a leap of faith, but each day more is known to make it a smaller one. This goes way beyond what we think of as ""just"" the power of positive thinking. The Secret is only a taste - an overview. But for those who are ready - and that's a surprisingly large group - it's the gateway to the experience of a lifetime, a voyage into awe and a glimpse into the depths, heights and unlimited expanse of life's majesty.

This DVD is entertaining as well as eye-opening. Approach it as a pleasant way to spend an hour or two, that just might also have a profound effect on your consciousness.

I am skeptical of much of what I see. But with this, I have seen and experienced MIRACLES (and see the testimonials in other posts)- AND SO CAN YOU.",1169942400,23,5242,4.807991120976692

view our lives, esp., when it doesn't meet our dreams. The SECRET is

dream fulfilling! I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!DAC",1168473600,10,272,4.76595744680851

But, the Secret Symphony is a big waste of money.  The music is boring and a waste of time.  Sorry, but I will be requested a refund.",1165536000,21,211,4.2
