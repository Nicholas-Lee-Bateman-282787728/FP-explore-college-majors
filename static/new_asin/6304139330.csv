7863826,5,6304139330,"I'm actually writing this review as I watch Fright Night for what has to be the 50th time.  I remember years ago when it first came out on video, having this movie on tape and watching it so much that I knew it word for word.  It's a great 80's horror flick. Not only with chills but with laughs!  Roddy McDowell is great!  Halloween time is right around the corner and Fright Night makes the perfect addition to your frightening features.",972086400,,439,4.382716049382716
