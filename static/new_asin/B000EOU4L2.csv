8112245,3,B000EOU4L2,"So for you women out there like me that ordered this for the firemen eye candy ;), this is a good workout.  I love that this video exists.  But the workout consists of alot of lunges.  My knees took a hit even with proper form.  But if you have good knees and you want a motivating reason to exercise, buy this!",1376784000,,311,4.049180327868853
8112246,5,B000EOU4L2,"I had gotten this DVD for my boyfriend who is an aspiring firefighter and in the hiring process with a couple of different departments.  I recently started getting on him about getting his fitness level up to par since if he does end up getting a call, he could easily get kicked out for not being at the department's standard (I also convinced him to start running since they do a lot of that).  When I got the DVD for him I watched him do it a couple of times and sorta made fun of him for finding it so difficult.  I do workout videos all the time and while I get tired I don't get nearly as tired as he was (and he makes fun of me for doing the ones I do so it wasn't out of spite - it was a friendly banter we have going on).  I would then joke about how he was having trouble walking the next day since this DVD uses a lot of the stabilizer muscles that don't normally get worked out very often (again, he makes fun of me when I can't walk either - it's just our relationship).  Anyway, I took the DVD and tried it myself since I figured it couldn't nearly be as difficult as it looks and I was very, very wrong!  As others have said, it is deceptively simple and when you watch it you think that it will be easy, but when you're doing it, you find yourself getting tired fairly quickly.  It kinda runs as a personal trainer-type video.  You do something for 45 seconds, you rest for 20 and then you move on to the next exercise.  I had to modify the plank pushup because of my wrist issues and actually ended up just doing a plank on my elbows for 45 seconds.  I think next time I will try a plank with leg raises.  Trust the other reviewers - this is definitely a workout and definitely worth it!  The banter does get old but as long as you concentrate on what you're doing and not what the instructor is saying you can pretty much block out a lot of what he says.  The 45 second interval counter at the bottom is a nice touch so you always know where you are in relation to how long each interval is.  I will definitely steal this from him more often and do it from time to time though.  It's a great DVD to have as part of any collection.",1297900800,2,2148,4.021176470588236
8112247,5,B000EOU4L2,"This is an incredible workout.  It seems so deceptively simple.  Exercise for 45 seconds and then recover for 20 seconds.  However, this is an intense and grueling and demanding workout.  It literally kicks ""booty"".  I couldn't complete the whole 45 seconds on a lot of them...and when the instructor says you will feel it in 48 hours (he's lying...you feel it the next day) you will really feel it.  I am not trying to be a firefighter; I just want to get in shape, but this is a great workout and I highly recommend this for someone who wants an effective, intense cardio workout.  One thing I didn't quite like about it was that there is no warmup or cooldown.  However, this is minor, I warmup and cooldown on the treadmill before and after the workout.
Some have said they don't like the friendly ""banter"" from the leader in the workout, but trust me, you won't even hear it half the time.  You will be concentrating so hard on the correct movement, balance, or trying to keep from passing out from the sheer intenseness of it that you won't notice.  The four people in the background must be in incredible shape, however you can see that it even gets to them sometimes.  I like the fact that they are in loose tee shirts and loose shorts.  They are there to workout, not be eye candy.
So, order this without delay.  You won't regret it.",1201219200,7,1342,4.450819672131147
8112248,5,B000EOU4L2,"I was very impressed with this workout video. The 'friendly banter' that goes along with the workout gets old pretty quick, but for anyone that works out to videos, you know you're muting it and booming a stereo once youve got the workout down.

I meant exactly what I said in the title as well. This is a glute and quad intensive workout. lots of lunging, lots of squatting but also very good cardio. You do get some upper body, but the progress you make there is pretty much dependant on the weight of your medicine ball. It's also an interval workout. 45 seconds of intense work, with 20 seconds to rest.

Coupling this video with a run day and some upper body/ab weight training will get you in shape. period. I was very pleased with my purchase, and hope to see Dr. Ross make some more videos in the future.",1158278400,,812,4.370860927152318
8112249,5,B000EOU4L2,"Great workout!  I have done it 6 times now and I am still sore 2 days afterwards.  There are great exercises here and while watching (not doing the workout) may LOOK easy, it is absolutely a kicker!  The exercises are very much work related.  It is designed to keep your posture while bending, reaching and extending with the medicine ball.  I'd recommend it not just to firefighters, but to any athlete.  This is a good workout.",1148515200,3,429,4.578947368421052
8112250,5,B000EOU4L2,This is a great workout video. I was skeptical at first and now after trying it for the first time---wowzie--its worth it. I was sore for 3 days after the workout. I like the variety of exercises so I wasn't bored and it got my heart rate up in ways I don't do in my normal routine. I really like the balance exercises as it helped my body be strong in my every day life. Like when I am holding the grocery cart with one foot so it doesn't roll away--balancing on the other foot as I scoop the bags into the back of the car. This is a video I can utilize a lot. I thought I had seen all the great workout videos until I saw this one. I highly recommend it.,1142899200,,656,3.9029850746268657
8112251,5,B000EOU4L2,"Man, was I surprised!  I have tried other ""firefighter workouts"" and they were not really much of a workout.  I did this one without a medicine ball the first couple times just to try it out.  It kicked my butt.  I was sore for 3 days.  Initially, some points were hard to keep up with and that got a little frustrating, but after doing the workout the second or third time I was able to keep up just fine.  Surprised me with the balance exercises, those were freakin' hard!

Great follow along workout.  I am taking it to work next shift!",1142640000,3,539,4.267326732673268
