8112927,2,B000EQ5URI,"To start, I'm a fan of Kareena Kapoor and I think Shahid Kapur is a good actor.  But this 2004 movie (somewhat early in their acting careers) is a harsh, unsympathetic, and extreme story.

The acting & cinematography are good (the DVD quality is good), but the characters' actions in this story are always extreme (love to die for, cruel/greedy personalities).  This is not a light/happy movie.

The ending, though reasonably appropriate, is a little shocking and very depressing.

I recommend the following movies that are actually enjoyable, with great stories/acting, involving these 2 actors as follows:
..... Kareena Kapoor  -  ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"" (2001),  ""Khushi"" (2003),  ""Jab We Met"" (2007), and  ""3 Idiots"" (2009)
..... Shahid Kapur  -  ""Vivah"" (2006), ""Jab We Met"" (2007), and ""Dil Bole Hadippa!"" (2009)",1284163200,2,821,5.183206106870229
8112928,1,B000EQ5URI,They are selling the cheap copy of the original movie so don't but from them if you want to buy an original one. I'm disappointed,1265673600,2,129,4.2
8112929,5,B000EQ5URI,"Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor have awesome chemistry on screen. And this film's plot had to be one of the most riveting one that I have watched in a long time. I mean, you are use to the female being scorned and having her go out for revenge, but not the male. Shahid was masterful. This is definitely one that you would want to add to your library. I did!",1259798400,,359,4.142857142857143
