Like whenever he goes to a new lesson, he just zooms and doesn't really explain and teaches WAY TOO FAST.He doesn't give enough time, plus when he speaks he pause's too much and stutters as he's thinking about the next word to say. I'm not talking bad about him, he's an amazing musician.

I'm almost in the advance stages in my music career and I'm a music major at school. I've had alot of teachers amazing like the instructor on this DVD that knew how to teach but this guy doesn't know how to teach. I bought another guitar DVD from this same series but for sweeping and let me tell you, I recommend that DVD to everyone and it's for all level of musicians, its incredible. Great instructor, he explains in details, and does it at a good moderate pace while teaching.",1235347200,2,923,4.366279069767442

Hap Hazard would be the best description of this dvd. If your a fan of Dave then it won't matter to you but to those trying to understand and dealve into the licks presented it was irratating.
