The tracking was terrible. As I said before, I hate to say anything negative against Amazon.  But we were very disappointment and dissatisfied with this copy.",1290470400,3,373,4.636363636363637

Unless you love Emilio and want every film or looking for something weird and from 80's pass this one by.",1458086400,,231,4.043478260869565

753028,4,6303984169,"What a punk.  When I was his age, I could have done that time standing on my head.  Let's see . . . I probably would have slept most of the first week.  Then until they let me out, I would have had time to work on my Theory of Everything.  That done, I might have then decided to work on solving Fermat's last theory (it was still unsolved back then) or pondered the meaning of life.  And all the while (except when sleeping) have worked on body weight exercises.  Plenty to do, no reason to be bored and slam your head against the wall.  Loser.",1449705600,,545,4.084905660377358

753147,5,6303984169,"I have forgotten how powerful these performances were! And watching it again after all these years and now having a child of my own, changes its impact.  Sometimes, after you grow up and watch a film that you thought was awesome when you were young, you're left feeling disappointed, but In The Custody Of Strangers you feel the impact from the other side... the parent.  Loved this movie when I was 18 and loved it now ...( you do the math ... lol)  A must see!",1448236800,,462,4.348837209302325

753152,5,6303984169,"Good video and pertinent even now, considering the fate of juveniles left to rot in the adult prison system. Unfortunately not much has changed since 1982. Most recently the case of Kalief Browder, a 16-year-old who was held in Riker's for three years on charges of stealing a backpack, most of that time in solitary confinement. He ended up committing suicide 2 years after his release.",1438473600,2,387,4.878787878787879

753156,5,6303984169,"Good story of ""outsiders"" intruding on family business.
Emilio Estevez is a very fine actor - Watch his movie
""The War at Home"" to understand what it was like to
be a returning Vietnam combat veteran.
I would recommend to anyone who can ""handle""
the language and emotional trauma...",1397952000,4,282,4.775510204081633
