My girls were unmoved and disinterested (2 & 4).  Other sight word learning DVD's are far superior;  for example, the I Can Read and Rock and Learn series are worth the cost.  Looking for an awesome DVD with a science theme?  ""Here Comes Science"" by TMBG is amazing.  My kids have asked for it over Disney, DreamWorks and Pixar!",1335398400,,497,4.6976744186046515
8530542,1,B003TX55AA,"The video was very boring, it just kept repeating the sight word over and over again with some music in the background. My five year old loves t.v. and he only watched it for two minutes and went off to do something else. Not worth it. I returned the product.",1289952000,,259,4.2
8530543,5,B003TX55AA,"I've been looking for a ""sight word"" dvd that would entertain and teach both a 2 year old and 4 year old and this little dancing monkey does it!  The best part is the music is actually fun and funky so I don't mind listening to it play over and over again.  I actually bought an extra copy to keep in the car for long trips!",1278547200,,324,3.893939393939394
8530544,5,B003TX55AA,"This dvd had my kids dancing the whole time! They couldn't wait to show their cousins the break dancing monkey. Love the music they use. After 3 kids and lots of dvd's, this is one of my (and their) faves. Looking forward to more in this series!",1278460800,,245,4.23404255319149
8530545,5,B003TX55AA,"Finally!  I have been waiting for there to be an educational DVD for my kids to watch that I can tolerate as well!  This DVD has a catchy beat that I find myself humming in the kitchen.  So fun for the kids they can watch it for hours, and the little monkey is hilarious!  I find my kids asking to watch it!  Great product!  Highly recommend it!",1278374400,,345,4.074626865671642
