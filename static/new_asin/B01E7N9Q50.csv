7731748,5,B01E7N9Q50,"Kids loved the movie, its CGI was ok, but had some great funny moments for the whole family to enjoy",1467936000,,100,4.05
7731749,3,B01E7N9Q50,"Tom (Milo Parker) a misunderstood child teams up with a fired ghost hunter Ms. Cuminseed (Anke Engelke) and a friendly green slime ghost (Bastian Pastewka voice) to go after a large ancient icy ghost and save the world...sort of like ""Ghost Busters"" but not as good.

While the acting was bad, I am sure the kids will enjoy the banter between bother and sister, the ghost, and a child trying to be accepted in an adult world. Tom is mature for his age.

On the negative side, and correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't that an F-bomb used near the end of the film borrowed from Bruce Willis film that starts out ""Yippee ki-yay...""",1464998400,,628,4.405172413793103

Sometimes as they reference it (one sequence is 4 or five times in a minute) - they are referencing someone's behind. The other times it's like, ""Don't make an ass of yourself."" My 4 and 6 year old children don't know that word and they didn't ask but after repeated use, I did tell them, ""That's actually not a nice word and it means butt but we don't use it.""
