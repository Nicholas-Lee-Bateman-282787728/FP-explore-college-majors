The vast snowy wasteland of northern Norway in winter with snow coming down almost every day will make most of us happy we live in the continental US. Our hero is Nils Dickman, who is out in his plow endlessly trying to keep the streets and highways clean. Nils gets a call from the police, who tell him his son died of a drug overdose. Nils says his son was not on drugs, but the police decide not to investigate what we and Nils knows is murder.

The advertisement for this film tells us that we can expect darkly funny humor. I don't think so. From the moment Nils decides to find out who killed his son to the horrific end of the story, death and destruction follow Nils and his snowplow. Nils is Jack Reacher or James Bond on a mission to get justice for his son. He won't be stopped.

The excellent German actor Bruno Ganz plays the part of a Serbian crime lord who has also lost his son to the same drug dealers who killed Nils son. They don't know it, but both fathers are working for the same purpose  vengeance on the Norwegian drug lord. I have to be careful now to say no more to not spoil the surprises in store for viewers of this fine film.

My film was subtitled; viewers need to be fast readers to keep up with the fast pace of the movie. That said, even when we don't get all the words, the visuals in the film tell us what we have missed. I mentioned Bruno Ganz, but the star of this film is the well known Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard. He is convincing in his role of avenging father who simply won't be stopped from his self-appointed task of getting justice for his sons death.

I am hoping people read my review and make it a point to see this film. I don't think they will be disappointed. The stark landscape, almost always in darkness, the character development as we come to know Nils and his desperate mission, and the final violent outcome perfectly in keeping with everything we have come to expect in the story demonstrate that Hans Petter Moland is a capable director on top of his game. 4  stars seems right for this movie..",1487548800,,2243,4.278301886792453

8689793,5,B00PY6P68G,"Nils is an upright citizen; he ploughs the snow covered roads in rural Norway and is seen as a hero by many - so much so that he is awarded `citizen of the year'. Then his son dies from a massive drugs overdose. The police say it is one of those things, but he is adamant that his dead son was never an addict.

Then when he thinks his life is over the truth about his son falls into his lap and he realises it was mischief of the highest order. So he decides that he will have revenge. This leads him to the nasty underworld of Norway's drug families - one local and one Serbian and once he gets involved things will never be the same again for any of them.

This is simply an excellent film, with so much going on that you may need to rewind unless paying 100% attention. The acting is superb - but Stellan Skarsgrd in the role of Nils is, as ever, just outstanding. It is filmed beautifully and though there are a couple of plot contrivances it does not take away from how compulsive and edge of seat marvellous this whole thing is. It was billed as a bit of a dark comedy, and there are a few moments but this is really a suspense, thriller with tons of snow and a lot of killings. In Norwegian, Swedish, German, English, Danish and Serbian (I kid you not) with very good sub titles in English, this is one to watch again so definitely a keeper.",1458259200,3,1349,4.145038167938932
