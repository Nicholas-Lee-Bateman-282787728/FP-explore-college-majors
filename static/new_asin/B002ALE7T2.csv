8359690,5,B002ALE7T2,I love this DVD! I do Jillian Michael's and my muscles can get bulky. this Pilates DVD in addition to yogafits yoga  DVDs stretch my muscles out giving me a long lean  muscle look. I notice a huge improvement in my shape when doing this routinely. I've owned this DVD for over 4 yrs and I've come back to buy it again because I can't find my copy anywhere. : ( I used to do this DVD with a group of women that would come to my home. They all loved it too. I've bought this DVD as gifts a few times. For someone who is used to exercising routinely it doesn't feel like a strenuous workout but just because it doesn't feel like hell doesn't mean you don't see results. I've done workouts that I feel like I'm going to die and I have t seen results like I do from this workout.,1409961600,,774,4.01948051948052
8359691,2,B002ALE7T2,"Not a good video. I'm a huge fan of YogaFit and was really looking forward to this DVD. What a disappointment!  Looks like it was shot in a garage with a 5 year old cell phone. The workout was ok, some chalenging postures but transitions weren't the best and I think I could get a better workout from some beginner DVDs. It will be back here used shortly.",1363219200,,355,4.220588235294118
