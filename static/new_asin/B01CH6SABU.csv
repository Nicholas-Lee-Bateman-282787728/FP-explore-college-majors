7683000,5,B01CH6SABU,"I can't believe this has finally made it to DVD! I've been waiting fifteen years for it. Literally.

I figured that Nathan Fillion or Ryan Reynolds was eventually going to do something that was so popular that the suits at the studio would do anything to make a buck off their popularity and I guess Deadpool did the trick.

Two Guys and a Girl (nee, Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place) is a treasure of late '90's/early 00's TV comedy. This half hour sitcom is the story of three friends just out of college in Boston. Michael ""Berg"" Bergen (Ryan Reynolds), the too-smart-for-his-own-good medical student, and his roommate Pete Dunville (Richard Ruccolo), always on the lookout for ""the one"" and knowing exactly what he wants to do in life...until he doesn't, schlep their way at Beacon Street Pizza. Their neighbor Sharon Carter (Taylor Howard) works as a spokesperson for a chemical company. The first season of the show has the same growing pains that many sitcoms suffer from--some gimmicky characters like Mr. Bowers (David Ogden Stiers) who frequently confuses his own life with the plots of movies, and a stock on-again-off-again girlfriend for Pete.

The show finds it's real footing in the second season with the addition of Nathan Fillion as Johnny Donovan, a blue collar Bostonian with a heart of gold and a thing for Sharon, and Suzanne Cryer as Ashley, the more-than-a-match-for-Berg medical student. The chemistry between the four main cast members is fantastic and the series is a tour-de-force for Ryan Reynold's improvisational delivery and physical comedy. The third season says au revoir to the pizza place (hence, the title change) and the characters get a chance to grow and stretch from the series' basic formula.

Is it a genre-breaking, trope-bending, ironic post-modern take on the sitcom? Pffft! No way. Two Guys and a Girl is a traditional multi-camera sitcom that delivers laughs through smart writing and brilliant acting. Like a lot of other shows that perhaps got lost in Seinfeld's shadow Two Guys and a Girl is a terrific watch and worth your time and your money. Along the way there is some romance, some crazy-neighbor dating, some house christening, some Bare Naked Ladies, and, of course, some Robert Goulet.",1458691200,36,2247,4.968085106382978

7683022,2,B01CH6SABU,I loved this show when it was on. I've been waiting forever for it to come out. I received it fast from Amazon but the very first disc has a huge mark across it. I didn't notice it until the disc kept freezing and I took it out and looked at it. It froze throughout the whole first disc. So far second disc is good BUT I will say the episodes are NOT in order which really disappointed me. First disc of first season is but second disc is not. I haven't watched the other discs yet but I'm assuming they're the same. If you've never watched the show it can be confusing. I will be callling Amazon as soon as I get some free time so I can get a replacement for the scaratch. I do love the show just really bummed that they're not in order like most Complete DVD sets.,1490313600,,766,4.0130718954248366

7683055,5,B01CH6SABU,"Two Guys And A Girl may have been one of the worst reviewed shows of the 1990's, with most reviews unfavorably comparing it to ""Friends"" and a slew of similar shows that were released in the same time frame.  Many review unfairly focused on the shows unfortunate original title ""Two Guys, A Girl and A Pizza Place"".  These reviews were unfair and short sighted, as this show while maybe not as refined as ""Friends"" or clearly defined as ""Seinfeld"" was still rather funny and unique in its own right.  The series focuses on three friends Berg (A breakout Ryan Reynolds), Pete (Richard Ruccolo) and Sharon (Traylor Howard) as they deal with their lives, careers and romances in their mid-20's.  Berg is a drifter who has not yet decided what he wants to do in life has bounced from one major in grad school to another, Pete has always wanted to be an architect but has never had a passion for it and Sharon has a corporate job  for a chemical company that she cannot stand.  The humor on the show is quirky in that it subverts some typical tropes of the genre (for example, their excellent Halloween episodes that are stand alone episodes and can be watched out of context from the rest of the series).  In the later seasons the series changes its concept a bit, dropping the ""Pizza Place"" where Berg and Pete worked to make extra money from both the title and the plot.  Additional cast members were added in later seasons most notably Nathan Fillion and Suzanne Cryer who would become series regulars and major characters on the show.

Overall this series is clever, unique, quirky and funny in ways it isn't expected to be. A perfect time capsule of what sitcoms were like the the late 1990's.  It could probably have been a bigger success had it debuted just a few years earlier, or a couple years later.  And if this had aired on say NBC or FOX instead of ABC at the time, I think it would have been a much more popular show. At the time ABC was stuck in a perpetual third place among the big 4 networks and that coupled with the poor reviews meant that few people watched this show.  Had it aired on another network I have no doubt it would have stood out for more positive reasons.  One thing worth noting is that while this series never got a huge audience (at least by the standard of the time) it did very well in demographics, in particular with the 18-49 demographic, often beating its timeslot rivals ""Dawson's Creek"", ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" and whatever CBS was airing at the time.",1471737600,10,2493,4.501108647450111

The packaging isn't the kind where you have to remove discs to get to others.

The bad:

7683074,5,B01CH6SABU,"Alright, this was one of the first things I converted to digital for my home server when I first started using my media center PC.  I still have those, and until now, they were the only ones I had.  They still had network logos, and a few spots had the first split second of commercials.  Didn't care, loved this show, had to have it.

LOVE that it came out on DVD finally.  There's just SO MUCH in this show to love.  If you liked Deadpool, this show, almost two decades earlier, shows why they picked Ryan Reynolds.  For me, this show has always been his defining moment.  This showcased his talent in ways that nothing else after ever did.  Consistently great line delivery, awesome timing, the smart-alec character, he did these to perfection in this series.

And he wasn't alone.  Every person in here (including the not-then-known Nathan Fillion) really had a chance to shine.

The acting was awesome.  The writing was fantastic, since still, almost 20 years later, despite me having every episode, I bought a new DVD set of it anyway.  Their Halloween episodes were just masterpieces.  One of my favorites is when they switch brains - because the actors weren't only great at doing their OWN characters, in this show, you could see how well they could do the OTHER person's character.

The story arcs weren't episodic, you didn't have all the junk they try to pull now-a-days to hook an audience.  No tricks, no gimmicks, just great writing, and great acting.

Characters were very well fleshed out, and you got to see their development and growth over the duration of the series.

VERY few shows for me have those literal ""Laugh Out Loud"" moments.  They are so few and far between, and this one packs in so many of them that it should be considered unhealthy.

I'm so glad to finally see this on DVD.  Hopefully now a whole new generation of people who never knew what it was will pick it up and enjoy the magic that was ""Two guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place.""",1467072000,12,1967,4.544159544159545

7683080,5,B01CH6SABU,"Yes! Finally! Finally! This is one of the greatest, best written and most imaginative sitcoms. It was totally underrated and robbed at its peak. So happy to finally have this on DVD so I don't have to watch my grainy WE taped copies.",1461974400,4,233,4.441860465116279
7683081,5,B01CH6SABU,"I can finally stop watching my VHS tapes with episodes recorded from the WE network years ago (all 81 eps).
I hope there are some good extras on the DVDs (like ""Irene's Cat Corner"" or something like that), although I am not holding out hope for cast commentaries.  However, a David Ogden Stiers commentary full of M*A*S*H anecdotes would lend a little gravitas.",1461283200,3,361,4.73015873015873

8753022,3,B01CH6SABU,"Love this show and thrilled to see it on DVD, but I'm disappointed in Shout Factory! for this release. The video quality is quite bad compared to many of their other releases. If you have a region free DVD player I highly recommend buying the UK DVD release of this show. The difference between the two is like having poor blurry vision and then putting on glasses. If you don't, the quality is watchable and the show is great, so enjoy!",1532131200,,437,4.407407407407407
