2351875,5,B000A2RRF4,"When will Sony release other MJ concerts like the Bad or HIStory tours. If you got the Ultimate collection, you would already have owned this DVD. Besides the rerelease of this DVD all in all it was pretty good. I especially enjoyed the Smooth Criminal performance. I recommend it to any type of fans of MJ beginner to hardcore fan.",1123027200,,332,4.55
2351876,5,B000A2RRF4,"I believe this concert by the King of Pop is simply his greatest, an unmatched performance by MJ that no other artist could even come closer...

The songs performed are a perfect choice, each song is a story; very interesting & magical, the concert is full of fireworks, stunning magics, terrific effects, and i believe Michael Jackson is the greatest dancer the world has ever witnessed!

I still can't believe how he performed these songs on stage that way they were done!

A must a have DVD for all music lovers, the DVD is worth every penny, its 2 hours long, the quality is great!",1122940800,,585,4.552380952380952

2351878,5,B000A2RRF4,"Those who have ever seen a Michael Jackson Live concert, surely buy this DVD. And those who have never seen a Michael Jackson Live concert don't know what they're missing until they see one. And since this is the only official live DVD of MJJ they have to buy this one!",1122681600,2,269,4.294117647058823
2351879,4,B000A2RRF4,"The Dangerous World Tour set is a wise compromise : MJ sings most of his mainstream hits, and the global experience is something between pure rock concert and hollywood musical.

Despite the odd outfits (remember this weird gold top ??), MJ dances and sings his heart out for more than 2 hours during this Goliath-ic gig.

Mj hardcore fans will tell you they prefer the Bad Tour concert, and they are right, since this previous tour was more about music.

The Dangerous Tour is THE MJ show to recommend to any non fan, new fan, or any other newbie.

Most of the tricks and ideas were core elements of the previous tours, but here they seem more polished and sophisticated.

The Dangerous Tour : Michael plays Jackson : the monster ""toaster"" + long ""strike a pose"" entrance is, so far, the best opening ever staged in a Jackson concert.

MJ comes in from nowhere, and, at the end, leaves the audience speechless, when riding a solid and sophisticated nasa-style equipment that, don't get me wrong, definitely flies him to the moon.

Hardline, Magic, State of the Art : Michael Jackson live is all that, and even more...

Main low point : the gradual and disappointing lip-sync routines : Jam and Smooth Criminal are ok though (those kind of songs are so hard to sing AND dance live that MJ has some excuse), but why using this ""technique"" on ALL the Dangerous Songs (Black Or White, Heal The World, Will You Be There etc..)?

Most end of those songs are sung live anyway, but, knowing the man has one of the most amazing voice in the History of popular music, it's a shame the staging focuses more on what we see instead of what we hear.

Note : Of course, No Bonus included, like most Michael Jackson DVD releases...",1121040000,32,1716,4.542207792207792

2351881,5,B000A2RRF4,"He is a legend. Michael Jackson is next level. A true star. This concert was my first introduction to him as a live performer and I was blown away. I actually felt like I was there. I screamed, sang out loud, cried, everything. Michael put on a real show from the vocals to the dancing to the pyrotechnics and the overall theatrics. He paved the way for stars like Beyonc, Chris Brown and Lady Gaga, who incorporate these different elements of a visual show to their live performances. If you have seen any of our current entertainers put on a show today, this is where they picked up the craft.",1505952000,4,595,4.418181818181818

Every city in every country of every continent that MJ had a concert in, he first always went to children's hospitals, shelters and schools to see how he could financially help improve those lives; and he always competed the mission. His overall daily humanitarianism and philanthropy was who he was; my kindred spirit.

I owned this DVD before, but someone stoled it. I will always cherish this concert performance.",1484438400,3,569,5.322222222222222

I would watch this live performance after watching ""Michael Jackson's This Is It,"" a rehearsal on another DVD that I also have with Michael preparing for the ""This Is It"" tour and what would have been his last performance.

It is also known that Michael Jackson passed away on 6/25/2009. And before and at that time, that's when Michael was preparing for the ""This Is It"" tour, and then it was canceled. I find that this is still a good live performance with Michael Jackson singing live in Bucharest, so I would watch this live performance for what would have been Michael Jackson's ""This Is It"" tour, and not only for that, but to also enjoy watching. I would even pretend that this is the ""This Is It"" tour that Michael was preparing for.",1425427200,,852,4.568627450980392

Michael of course is GREAT. But when isn't he?
This video is different than all his other concert videoes because they show the audience reaction often. Too often for some (my husband gets frustrated with all the girls screaming and crying and fainting, he wants to see Michael dance not the girls). But I LOVE THIS VIDEO.

The audio quality is fair (a bit reverb heavy).  The camera work is the most disappointing part; if you actually care to watch Michael perform, I would recommend Bad tour: Live at Wembley Stadium DVD in which the camera follows Michael the entire time.

2352187,5,B000A2RRF4,"I don't know how Michael did it, but he topped his Bad tour video I just watched, not by anything marked but just by an overall presence he exuded in the performance.  It was a longer concert for one thing, he was 4 years older than the Bad tour concert I watched (London @ Wembly) and LOVED, and there's something really sexy about the way he ...moved, did things, in this concert.  I cannot put my finger on it. More great songs, of course, since he had put more music out by 1992, and the crowd at Bucharest HAD to have exceeded the crowd in London. It looks double the size though I do not know the numbers.  It was amazing to see all the beautiful people of mixed races singing his songs and loving him, a real reflection of the world who still loves him to this day.  The did cut to the audience alot at the first of this video, and some people reported that as annoying, but it didn't bother me.  I will watch this video again and again, when I can!  It's like a marathon, watching an MJ concert. I cannot imagine what it was like to be there.  For those of us who never got to, this is as close as we will get.

2352430,2,B000A2RRF4,"Okay, I'm not some major Michael Jackson fan and I've never seen him live but I was looking forward to this video. I actually bought it for my foster boy who loves music and dance and was hoping we would watch it together. Glad I previewed it first! MJ's incessant crotch-grabbing started within the first 30 seconds and did not subside. Wow. I was pretty uncomfortable watching it so I sure wasn't going to let the child see this. I'm no prude. I was a dancer for many years and have been to many topless cabarets, etc. which I enjoyed but MJ was really creeping me out. Aside from this, the audio is less than exciting. Hollow is a good description, and not a lot of clarity. Pretty poor camera work too. Perhaps my biggest criticism though was the relentless footage of crying, fainting fans. Yikes! The only good thing about that was the respite it gave from MJ's grab bag. I could not have cared less about the fans, yet the film maker insisted on cutting back and forth between them and the performance on stage. Booo! Sooo disappointing on many levels. I watched the first 30 minutes and then couldn't manage anymore. Plus, I was pretty sure my husband's head might explode if I didn't turn it off. Anyway, feeling pretty good about never having shelled out a lotta dough to see this LIVE! I just purchased a new personal CD player for my boy along with the ""Jackson 5's Greatest Hits."" Maybe I'll give him the video when he graduates from junior high school.",1331424000,4,1466,4.49438202247191

I was amazed by Michael's energy and his ability to sing, dance and command the stage. I'd been a fan for a long time, but this performance really sealed the deal for me.

2352505,5,B000A2RRF4,"In 1993, the Singapore leg of the Dangerous concert was cancelled half an hour after it was due to start. Apparently Michael Jackson had taken ill, leaving thousands high and dry. The make up show featured a considerably reduced set list compared to this DVD. Most of the time, I heard loud music and screaming but not Michael's singing. I can't say I blamed him. Who would have the mood to perform with all those child molestation accusations?

So I'm thankful that Sony is still printing this. Finally, I get to watch Dangerous in it's entirety with the showmanship and special effects up close. The pacing is frantic and frenetic as the Moonwalker whips the crowd into a frenzy with Jam, Wanna Be Startin' Sometin' and kept going for nearly two hours. People wept openly and many girls wet themselves at the sight of his G string bodysuit and had to be carried off in stretchers.

2352550,5,B000A2RRF4,"Can't believe it's been almost 3 years. Anyway, this concert originally aired on HBO back in '89 and I can remember watching it back then, awed by the endless throng of fans, by the pomp and splendor and majesty of this man's mystique, and by the production values dedicated to each and every one of his numbers, which are absolutely unbelievable. This guy was not only the greatest dancer who ever lived, he was an iron man. The energy he puts into each and every song in this concert is like a James Cameron film jacked up on steroids. Mike was an alien.

Looking at it now makes me appreciate just how great this guy was as a performer and the black hole his death created in the entertainment world. This guy was a superstar from the time he was nine years old to the time of his death a couple of years ago, going from being a cute mini James Brown back in the early Seventies to the tall, supernaturally gifted dancer AND SINGER whose fans, unlike himself,remained as young as they were when he was a kid. Truly, his songs provide a soundtrack for my life, each one brings back a specific memory of where I was, my school, old friends I used to know back in my old neighborhood I grew up in, good memories as well as bad his songs were always around marking time. Regardless of what was published, true, untrue, or strange, about his personal life, there was no denying the pureness of his songs, songs about love and innocence, songs you don't have to bleep because of all the curse words, songs any kid of any age can listen to, songs about magic as he himself was magic and a miracle. I heard an interview he did where he spoke on immortality saying that he tried to put everything he had into each of his songs, to fuse his soul to them, and that this was his way of achieving immortality. Listening to his songs on this video it's like he's still here. Thanks, Mike.",1318982400,,1877,4.332386363636363

2352552,1,B000A2RRF4,"First of all, this show is fantastic, especially for a show in the 90's when there were less bells and whistles.  This has everything you would expect to see from a MJ concert.  However, I have some incredible issues with the production.  Allow me to preface this with the fact that I am a camera operator, director, & all things video roadie.  Here's my point.
1) The audio is hideous and I find myself wondering how it got past MJ perfection standards.  They just plopped a mic out in the crowd and recorded the live audio, rather than recording the line audio.
2) WAY TOO MANY crowd shots.  Some are necessary, especially on a dvd to convey the magnitude of the size of the crowd to someone at home that was not able to be there.  However, it is overdone, by about 5 times as much as it should be.  It distracts and forcibly pulls the viewer away from MJ.
3) The director was awful.  He/she continuously took shots of the side screens, with live content and b-roll.  Yup, instead of seeing MJ, we saw a screen see MJ, from a ridiculous side angle.  And yup, instead of dissolving to b-roll content, we see a screen with b-roll content, once again from a ridiculous side angle.  I get that LED walls in the 90s were much rarer than they are now, but for a camera to shoot the side screens is just pointless.
I am a HUGE MJ fan, so I don't want to appear to be critical for the sake of being critical.  However, if you can get your hands on any of the bootlegs out there, give those a try.  I had a hard time giving this 1 star, but being in the industry and knowing how good it could have/should have been with a few simple changes, I couldn't possibly allow my MJ fan bias to unfairly rate this dvd.",1311033600,18,1702,4.2291021671826625

She was so pleased to receive this DVD and another - This is It - that she was crying happy tears. God bless you Michael for everything you gave this world.

2352557,5,B000A2RRF4,"Growing up, I never quite had the change to listen to that much Michael Jackson. My parents would listen to the classics, of course, such as Abba, Boney M, Gipsy Kings, Nat King Cole, etc. and my brothers and sister were more classic rock fans.
I quickly picked up the best of both worlds, and also started expanding my own music horizons with the greatest, such as Depeche Mode.

Being from Bucharest I always knew that Michael had two concerts here, one in 1992 and one in 1996. When I heard, back in 2005, that the one from the Dangerous Tour was released on DVD I knew I had to watch it, even though I was not a fan at the time. This concert is the reason I became a fan.

Make no mistake. If you are a fan of good music, impecable coregraphy and good shows, you will love this one. Michael is at his top form, performing the best of the best in an unimaginable way. You have got to see it.

Back in 1992, this concert was aired all over the world, including on HBO in the US and still is, to this day, the highest audience in the channel's history for a single broadcast.

There are 3-4 lip-synced songs, one or two of them in order to let him catch his breath for more difficult songs that would follow, and another two because of the coregraphy and the fact that he actually is not on stage in those moments, changing outfits and preparing for the next song.

Words would not do this concert justice, you've got to watch it, end to end and see for yourself the magic of Michael Jackson. No matter what the tabloids wrote about him, what is actually true and what isn't, nobody can deny that he was pure genius on stage and that he is the best.

And that is all that matters.",1297123200,,1681,4.204968944099379

2352559,3,B000A2RRF4,This is more how the audience reacts to stars video. Who wants to watch the audience act like idiots instead of getting to enjoy your favorite singer. Who filmed this? Michael of course is wonderful when you get to see him.,1295481600,2,223,4.463414634146342
2352596,5,B000A2RRF4,"I've been an entertainer myself working as hard as Michael and find it insulting when more lies about him are spread and untrue. I have this concert and it's obvious that it is him singing. Or do you not notice the wireless microphone. If anyone can spot lipsyncing it's me. This is not one of those. This was live and you can also tell by the pitch of his voice which is a bit lower than the norm that it is genuinely his voice.

I don't know if you're getting mixed up with some other artist but this is one of the greatest performances I've ever witnessed,The light show is great, the sounds of chimes makes the music sounds even better, he doesn't cut anyone off unless that's how you took it as your mistake. Michael was out of breath not only because dancing and singing together will do that to you, I should know, I've been there, when he sings the slow songs it's to help him catch his breath to get ready for the next fast dancing routine. Watch again and you'll know what I mean but Michael does not lip sync in this concert.

This is one of the best DVD in concert because it was live and we all know what a perfectionist he was, this dvd had to be perfect and he of coarse wouldn't have wanted his fans to have lipsyncing dvd. So please watch again and in stereo if you can and you can clearly hear every note if you know what you're looking for. This is a beautiful concert he worked so hard for, please don't be little it. I rate this concert a 5 star if not better if they were to allow that.

In ""She's Out of My Life,"" Michael brought a lady up on stage for a brief amount of time. It was an emotional performance. ""Thriller"" was okay. The stunt that went along to ""Beat It"" was noteworthy. ""Heal the World"" presented a ballerina and included foreign children upon stage.

I have the Live in Japan too, but it also has shortcomings.  I don't know if MJ did this on purpose so that his fans would still want to see him live.  If so, it is definitely working on me!

The man has to breathe, you know ?

I took off a star because this video spends waaay too much time showing swooning fans.  I am interested in watching MJ, not watching the fans in the audience.  It is a pity because all the fan shots take away from the show.

Michael Jackson was incredibly talented in everything he did.  If you really watch it, you'll see how much thought he put into every detail of his work.

 It is the saddest thing that he died so early.  He had so much to give us.

2352692,1,B000A2RRF4,"I was very disappointed in this concert DVD mainly because it was edited so poorly.  It seems like every 30 seconds the cameras cut to shots of the audience- who cares about seeing that?!  Most of us go to concerts and buy concert DVDs to watch the performer, not look around at the reactions of the crowd!  It seemed like as a whole this video consisted of 75% audience shots/reactions and only 25% of Michael's performances and stage shots.  The video started right off this way with tons of audience shots and it bothered me from the start.  I thought ""I hope it doesn't do this throughout the whole concert"", but it did.  So much of Michael's performances are lost to us the viewer as we, beyond our control, are forced to watch fans in the crowd faint, cry, sing, yell, etc.  Then, a lot of the footage shown of Michael performing is shot from a camera far away, as if we are standing in the 500th row watching the concert.  Not many close-ups of the stage and of Michael performing.  Very frustrating!
Other dislikes:  Michael's onesie shirt that accented his crotch area in gold for the first several songs. Yukk.  Poor taste in costume design and poor choice in wearing it.  Then there was a segment where a video is shown on big screens to the audience where Michael is in an alley like in his ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" video.  In this short film he is practically ""pleasuring himself"" and that seems to be the theme of it.  I fast forwarded this as my 15 year old daughter was watching the DVD with me- and really, nobody needs to see that!  Come on Michael!  I think this was the time in Michael's career when he had taken a friendship with Madonna and asked her for her ""artistic"" ideas to integrate into his performances.  I wish he never asked for such advice/influence from someone like her.  Thanks for nothing, Madonna!  And thanks for nothing film editors of this concert!",1267401600,7,1891,4.476608187134503

2352695,3,B000A2RRF4,"Let me start by saying I am a longtime MJ fan who grew up listening to the Jackson 5. Their Saturday morning cartoons and cereal box records were a way of life for me as a kid and are still some of my fondest and most vivid childhood memories. Since his untimely death I have been revisiting not only the Epic MJ albums, but the Motown and J5 catalog as well, and have recently discovered many musical gems I had been unaware of until recently. So naturally my attention eventually turned to MJ DVD's, which has led me to writing this review.

I must confess that I am guilty of putting Michael Jackson on the shelf in recent years, but I have recently been making up for lost time. So although this concert is not new, it is new to me. It is a top notch performance of his Dangerous Tour, but I would like to get my hands on and slap the person who was hired and actually payed money to butcher the King of Pop's performance contained in this video. I understand the concept of trying to include the audience's reaction as part of the concert experience, but every other camera shot is of the audience and completely distracts from MJ's performance. This should be called ""The Audience of The Dangerous Tour featuring Michael Jackson.""

Don't get me wrong, this is an incredible performance and a must see for any MJ fan, but be forewarned that it is badly edited with way too many camera cuts of the audience screaming, crying and passing out during the entire performance. It gets annoying very fast and is very distracting during some of the most important dance sequences. I hope this will someday be re-edited to focus more on the performance instead of the audience and eventually be re-released. Until then, this is the best and most recent concert performance that exists of the King of Pop.",1267142400,6,1800,4.5184049079754605

2352718,5,B000A2RRF4,"Sorry to say that I didn't pay much attention to MJ the performer until after his death.  Went to see ""This Is It"" to see how he worked as well as the substance to his talent.  In short, there was a lot to be impressed about.  Even while rehearsing for the London Tour he obviously had a lot of the energy shown many years before on this performance.  MJ was a real talent.  I have come to appreciate him lately.  I wish I had sooner.  This video is fun to watch and to see an exceptional ""song and dance"" man at work!",1265241600,2,518,4.019607843137255
2352719,5,B000A2RRF4,"I was born in 1958.  So I grew up as MJ grew up.  I always loved him, and his music and dancing.  In my 20's I joined a spa and the Jazz-ercize class worked out to ""Off the Wall"" 4 times a week.  I never got tired of it.  I kind of lost touch with Michael as the years went on.  I got married, had kids and started two bands of my own, in my spare time.  LOL.  BUT  Michael's death really hit me hard.  I think because he was my age, and I realized what a massively talented person he was. I bought ""This is It"", because I missed it in the theaters.  Then I decided to see what Michael's last tour was like so I bought ""Live in Bucharest"".  HOLY CROW!! He never stops moving, and he is definitely NOT lip-synching to any of his music.  There are times he is so out of breath, he falls to his knees, or even flat on his face and just lies there.  The crowd goes wild.  Then he picks himself back up and starts again.  He goes from one gut-busting song to the next.  You can see his chest heaving from excursion.  I have never, in all my life, seen a performer give so much of themselves to an audience.  He is just out there, totally for them, heart and soul.  I would have to say Michael Jackson is the greatest showman I have ever seen. He can cause havoc in the crowd with a tilt of his hat.  What more can I say.  Get the DVD.",1265241600,4,1329,3.898876404494382

2352721,5,B000A2RRF4,"Since his death I've been strangely consumed with everything Michael Jackson.  A fan since the earliest days of the Jackson 5, he always amazed me with his jaw-dropping talent but revisiting all of his music and seeing previously unviewed videos just takes my breath away.  Wow!

You are in awe watching him perform.  From the opening stunner where he's catapulted onto the stage to the over-the-top departure in a space suit powered by a jetpack, I was mesmerized.  I was just swept up in his magic--loved the control and anticipation that he created by simply standing statue-still when he hit the stage. You almost wondered if he WAS just a statue and it was all just an illusion.  I have no idea how many people were at this concert, but it was a sea of rocking, swaying, ""fainting"", screaming humanity.  They'll never be another entertainer who was so adored, so affected by his fans.  I thought it was particularly touching to see him allow a fan to actually hug him and have him respond with such affection.  He didn't just hug--he LOVINGLY EMBRACED that very, very lucky fan and kissed her sweetly on the cheek.  She sure didn't want to let go.  Who would?

Yeah, he lip-synched on several songs but his duet with Sieda Garrett was so great and I had tears in my eyes during the very moving Will You Be There?  No one will ever move as sensually and with such perfect control and grace like he did.  He truly was otherworldly and simply ""became"" the dance when he was on stage, moving to a voice, a vibration heard and felt only by him.

Favorite song?  Couldn't possibly name one.  I love them all for the emotions they evoke, for the funk, and the beat and the love they never fail to convey.

This is as close as one can get to seeing a young, vibrant, extremely sexy and fabulously-talented Michael Jackson--at the top of his game!

I highly recommend this video. If you are a fan, or just curious about his music and genius creativity, you need to get this video.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!

The expression Gone Too Soon seems so inadequate in responding to his tragic and untimely death. As Berry Gordy said in Moonwalk, Michael Jackson comes along only once, period. One of the big regrets of my life is never getting to be part of one of his concerts.

How fortunate that we lived and enjoyed him during his time on earth.  May his music and compassionate humanitarianism live forever.  He was all for L.O.V.E.
May God bless and watch over his adorable children, always.

I love you Michael! (and I can clearly hear him respond with, ""I love you more!"").",1264982400,6,2571,4.549019607843137

This DVD includes, Jam, Wanna Be Startin somethin,Human nature, Smooth Criminal, I just Can't Stop Loving You, She's Out of My Life, Jackson 5 Medley (I Want You Back, The Love You Save, I'll Be there), Thriller Billie Jean, Working Day and Night, Beat It, will You Be There, Black or White, Heal The World, and Man in the Mirror. I plan to donate my MJ books to the local library after I've read them. It is a way to get out that he was innocent and that his kind of entertainment talent only happens once. I am a new fan; post MJ's death. To keep his legacy alive we need to spread the word. I'd like to see a book dedicated soley to MJ's humanitarian deeds.

Those with few or no memories of having seen him work in film, on TV or live. Is there anything  here that warrants attention. For most who are open to pop of another sort than that to which they were/are accustomed  I think this will be a fine couple of hours. The show is ultra spectacular in its technology; but, more important, is the high degree of integration between the material aspects of the show, the featured cast, and, above all, the focus of all their efforts, Michael Jackson. He is seemingly charged up by what is going on with him at its center while, at the same time, he energizes that which is focused upon him.  Most energized by him is the audience which becomes a central component of the performance, second only to Jackson himself. As the first Beatle film showed, scenes of audience adulation and physical hysteria, influence the ultimate viewing audience.
Enough said. If you haven't seen this phenomenon perform, do so while he is still part of the world's cultural heritage.",1260230400,,1179,4.653846153846154

I purchased this dvd because after the Bad Tour, Michael's tours were outside of the U.S., so I wanted to see what fans in other parts of the world got to see.  As with most Motown-trained artists, Michael always put on top notch shows full of real singing, both precise and free-style dance moves unique to Michael, theatrics and great showmanship. What's always amazing is the high, never-ending energy with no intermissions.  Michael always gave audiences their money's worth- usually at least 2 hours of performance with few long breaks or wardrobe changes common to other artists' shows.

Michael is such a wonderful dancer and performer. You want to keep your eyes on him at all times.

How frustrating, then, to have the camera constantly pull away to show the crowd. Right in the middle of intricate dance steps! What a waste! Sure it conveys excitement, but how many fainting young people do we have to see passed hand over hand through the crowd to the medics? Someone was really misguided here. There are also a lot of cutaways to the other musicians, but at least this makes more sense, and is part of what we want to see - the performance. If I wanted the other, I could look in the mirror and scream Michael and hyperventilate till I passed out.

When the camera is on Michael, though, it is worth it.

----The main beginning, three minutes of nothing but Michael shooting up on stage and standing in his HIStory pose. Pay attention to the crowd as Michael just STANDS THERE...people crying and passing out at the mere SIGHT of Michael Jackson. And he hasn't even done anything yet! THAT'S a talented man!
----The end of Smooth Criminal. I'm not gonna spoil it for you, but put it this way -- it is COOL.
----The entire performance of Thriller, including the choreography at the end of the video...and yes, they use zombie's on stage, in case you're wondering like I know you are. :)
----The moonwalk during Billie Jean and the Bucharest crowd going nuts.
----How exhausted Michael looks at the end of Man In The Mirror, and they pull a James Brown cape stunt, so to speak, with Man In The Mirror. It's just neat to see them pay tribute to James Brown in their own special way.
----THE END OF THE ENTIRE CONCERT! I'm not giving anything away, just like Smooth Criminal above, just in case you haven't seen it yet, but let me tell ya -- the first time you see the ending of this entire concert, it is going to blow your mind and shock the daylights out of you -- because I know it definitely did me.

While Michael's performance is as amazing as you'd imagine, I'm so annoyed by the makers of this DVD because they spent more time filming fans fainting and passing out than they did Michael!  I did not buy the DVD to see all of the fans every two seconds, and was a bit disappointed that the focus of the cameras wans't entirely on Michael so that I would feel like I myself was watching the concert.  Too many camera angles away from Michael during his dance moves to show fans' ugly mugs.  Ugh.",1255564800,,649,4.252032520325203

Although I love all his videos, this video makes me feel like I am one in the audience watching him on a live concert. There is quite an emotional response from the millions of fans attending the concert, responding to the meaning of his words- tears as well as enjoyment.
There is no doubt that Michael is truly loved by all his fans world wide. I love his other videos as well especially some of his songs that are not in this video.",1255132800,,529,4.247524752475248

No one will ever command the undivided attention of an audience the way Michael Jackson did as he performed.

One of the reviewers stated that there was a lot of lip synching.  I completely disagree.  You can tell that Michael is singing the whole time.  With any extraordinarily choreographed performance you will have some back track vocals for certain pieces but that is to be expected.

Michael is wonderful and really loves his fans, you can feel it through the entire concert.  He is so missed and it is almost mind-boggling to know that we will never see someone like Michael again in our lifetime.  That time is done and it's so sad.  It makes me want to turn back time and somehow make things turn out differently.  I am so happy that I was alive during Michael's most creative years and to watch him take the world by storm.  His music is such a part of my entire life, I can place certain MJ songs with every phase of my 35 years.

2352878,5,B000A2RRF4,"Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour showcases Michael Jackson the performer better than any other DVD available from the King of Pop. Filmed in 1992, this video features non-stop dancing and incredible theatrics set to some of the greatest (mostly live) pop music of all time. Highlights include ""Jam,"" which kicks the show off with a bang after Michael pops up from under the stage, ""Human Nature,"" featuring some of his best dance moves, and a phenomenal performance of ""Billie Jean"" - moonwalk, white glove, and all. It's also wonderful to see Michael and Siedah Garrett share the stage for their duet ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You."" There is not a dull moment throughout the entire show. Even after the encore, an MJ look-a-like straps on a jet pack and soars above the stage. Yes, there is a lot of editing. Constant crowd shots of obsessive fans (from multiple concerts) become a little tedious, and a few of the songs are lip-synched. The footage is not HD and ought to be remastered. Still, this video is perfect for anyone who appreciates Michael's showmanship and otherworldly talent and wants to see it first hand. 4.5 Stars.",1253232000,2,1138,4.811224489795919

I ordered it from Amazon and it is a dvd I know I will never tire of watching. To me, this is Michael truly at his best and his energy and mastery in his performance is just something you can't take your eyes off of. There are cut aways to the audience several times but I did not mind that as it captured the incredible emotion from his fans and believe me they were enjoying this concert! I loved all of the songs and it was wonderful to see such joy in Michael's face..there was one moment in particular that was really moving to me, when he was singing Heal the World he brought out several children, among others, and at one point while singing he picked up a small child and held him as he sang and Michael had such a loving look in his face, so happy, and he giggled and it was just such a genuine, sweet moment..the true essence of the loving sweet soul and gentle spirit that Michael was. I really wish Michael could have known how much he was loved and how many people have been affected by his loss. I am so grateful to have this dvd to cherish and relive his wonderful memory..it is a heartwarming, uplifting experience watching this dvd and I shed some happy tears and some sad ones.

I can now see why the world considered him to be the King of Pop, regardless of your personal views of him, he had a talent that can not be duplicated.

After the burial of my nephew, my family and I sat back and watched the video and like I was they were awestruck. This is one awesome concert, that is all I can say. Anyone who was not blessed in watching him live, should watch this DVD, you get a chance to see first hand what the hoopla was all about. RIP MiJac",1252800000,,654,4.030769230769231

I will be buying it.  There are lots of highlights, but the performance of Beat It is out of this world. Imagine a live band and awesome background vocals, plus MJ's seemingly unending energy.  It's astounding that this was one of the last cities he visited on the tour and still the energy and performances are top-notch. Very little lip-synching from what I can tell.  His voice is deeper than usual on many songs, but just as smooth. It's true that he was a perfectionist and he also is engaged on an emotional level in every song on this set.  Slash does not perform in this concert, as is suggested in the first reviewer. Also enjoyed Man in the Mirror, Thriller, Smooth Criminal.  Two songs were a bit disappointing - Human Nature and Wanna Be Startin Something.  However, after those two songs he hit everyone out of the ballpark.  On several of the songs, the James Brown style comes through.  Wish I could have seen it in person, but I am sure it would have been nearly impossible to get such a good seat!",1252368000,,1172,4.393518518518518

2352977,5,B000A2RRF4,"Im a huge MJ fan..I was amazed when I saw this concert in 1992 on HBO and Im even more amazed 17 years later...The set list is wonderful. The effects are astonishing. The dancing is astounding. With musical director and keyboardist Greg Phillinganes brilliance, Ricky Lawson on drums and Siedah Garrett's tremendous background and lead vocals this video is a must own..Did I mention Michael Jackson's performance? No one has even come close to a performance like this one..On his worst day he was better than anyone..I wish more filmed concert from the Dangerous tour or any of his tours were available.. But if this is the only one of his stage spectaculars available on DVD I can live forever with it......To bad HBO felt the need to constantly show the audience but thank goodness they filmed this concert! Sound and picture are both good..No bootleg here.....UPDATE.......After seeing ""This Is It"" many times, it now becomes the evolution of the ""Dangerous"" tour just as the ""Bad"" tour evolved into the ""Dangerous"" tour...MJ was a one time gift to the world.

The songs, the dancing, the choreography, the music, the musicians, the lighting, the stagecraft . . . this is a great concert conceived by the one and only Michael Jackson.  When he asked if he could come down into the audience (while singing ""She's Out of My Life"") . . . and the crew produced a pretty girl to come up on stage . . . well, those are theatrics, by a master.  And the ending of the concert is beyond reality.  Well worth the price to have in your forever collection.",1251590400,,495,4.290322580645161
2353039,2,B000A2RRF4,"I was greatly disappointed in this DVD. There were many things that bothered me about this DVD, one: The sound is terrible!! It is quite difficult to understand what he is saying even when singing. I don't know why they don't take the sound direct from the mikes and not from the speaker system. Second, film quality is poor to fair at best. From what I am hearing this common with all his concert DVD's and this is a tragety if its so, the King of POP in this day and age has no filmography worthy of his status!!! Third and most annoying, whoever directed/edited this DVD stood fast to the 5 second rule, no scene shall last more than 5 seconds. This can actually get nauseating with all these quick cuts and gratuitous shots of the audience to ad nauseum!!! Who cares, when he is on stage I want to see this guy Move and they actually cut away from some intricate dance sequences of Michael and cast to showing fainting screaming fans. Ridiculous.
  This is no slight against the talent of Michael as even with all these flaws this DVD shows a HARD working talent giving his fans all he has. This DVD is a poor legacy for a King, especially one who now has left us so untimely.",1251590400,3,1180,4.334841628959276

2353046,5,B000A2RRF4,"I only needed that one word to describe it!

I have been an MJ fan since I was six year old when BAD was released. This man has always fascinated me and I always thoroughly enjoyed his music.

Following his untimely demise, I was watching youtube videos like crazy of MJ and I filled my Netflix queue with MJ DVDS. The first one I received was the Live in Bucharest one. I usually hold on to the DVDs I get from Netflix for just one night and then I mail it back the next day.

However, I kept THIS ONE for over a week and I practically shed a tear when I mailed it. It was awesome!!! The crowd was energetic and Michael's moves just had me sitting there slack-jawed. My favorite performances were 'Human Nature', 'She's Out Of My Life', 'Working Day and Night', 'Beat It' and of course the start-off song 'JAM'. And in most of these songs he is NOT lip-synching. He is giving his all!!

That same day I returned that DVD I went and brought my own. All MJ fans should own this!

MJ at his finest!!",1251331200,,997,4.171875

However living near Neverland and where the trial was held, we heard all about it on the nightly news.  One of the first things I was able to get to explore more about this engmatic man was this DVD.  I was thrilled and enchanted with it's contents and, as I now realize, I was spoiled by viewing this DVD before the other concert or documentary footage. This showcases MJ fabulously and gives the uneducated a glimpse into how many people adored this man and to what lengths they would go to see hin in concert.  If, you are like me, please, especially if you only have a limited amount of money to spend, buy this DVD over the others.  This DVD is all concert footage.

I can't tell you how excited I was to see him in action on stage! Believe me I was not dissapointed, it was the next best thing to being there live! I especially enjoyed watching the reaction of the people screaming, and fainting at his every move. There will never be another entertainer that can capture the hearts, and the emotions that Michael did! This was one of the best investments I have ever made, and I'll have it forever!

2353112,5,B000A2RRF4,"This concert originally took place in 1992 when Michael Jackson was at the peak of his legendary career. It aired live on HBO and although there were several thousand people in attendance, it was seen by millions more around the world. 17 years and 2 months after his death, I had to buy the DVD. From the moment he exploded onto the stage, I knew I would not regret watching.

And I was not disappointed.

Before I proceed, I do want to correct the two reviewers before me: Michael Jackson is a perfectionist when it comes to his craft. He said himself on multiple occasions he does not believe in cheating his fans and supporters. To that end, Michael Jackson does not Lip Synch. This little-known fact was brought to light when he asked Paula Abdul (the very same from American Idol) to help him with the Librarian Girl Music Video (which he also directed and produced). MJ does not go halfway and thus when he sings live, you're hearing HIS voice, not ths track.

* On Dangerous Album

Although only four of songs he performed were from the actual albumn, the songs he performed more than made up for this. In Jam, The King of Pop demonstrates his versatility by doing a sideways Moonwalk. In Wanna Be Startin' Something and Human Nature, he serinades to the audience. With Smooth Criminal, Michael Jackson does an amazing adaptation of the Music Video (which was actually a scene from the forgotten musical/movie Moonwalker) of the same name--complete with his patented 540 degree lean. The song ends with MJ turning back at his backup dancers while they're shot with invisible bullets. The lights dim while stagehands drag them from backstage.

MJ transforms from badboy to Romeo with I Just Can't Stop Loving You and gives one lucky fan a night she will never forget while performing She's Out of My Life. MJ takes us back to his days as a member of the Jackson 5 with I Want You Back, The Love You Save and I'll Be There. At the end of the third song, he calls out each of his brothers by name, a spotlight shining on empty microphones behind him.

MJ brings us back to the 80s as he does the two songs that essentially earned him MTV's Male Artist of the Millenium: Thriller and Billie Jean. He ends Thriller with a disappearing act, only to reappear as Billie Jean begins to play. Here, Michael Jackson does a pair of Moonwalks and demonstrates the footwork that some say inspired a later album--Blood on The Dance Floor.

Workin' Day & Night was prettymuch a transitional song, as right after it ended (which another disappearing act) he went right into Beat It. He begins the song atop a lift that moves him over the audience as he sings. When he returns to the stage he reinacts the last 2 and a half minutes of the Beat It Music Video. There is an intermission as MJ prepares for the next song.

This one may look familiar if you've seen the 1995 film Free Willy--clips from the movie and this concert were used to make a Music Video for the motion picture. I prefer this version of Will You Be There (the performance over the Music video) myself. Another intermission follows but this time we are treated with the controversial Black or White scenes that originally aired when the music video was introdiced to the world on MTV, Fox and VHI. After the interlude, MJ does the actual song.

The concert wraps up with Heal the World and Man in the Mirror. Speculation states the child MJ holds at the end of Heal The World is Prince Michael--his first son. Of course, this can't be possible as the concert took place 2 years before he married Lisa Marie Presley. At the end of Man in the Mirror, MJ ends the concert in the one way that could possibly top his electrifying performance. You'll have to see it yourself because I'm not telling.

In closing, I would like to say this. Michael Jackson's music is what he's most famous for. Despite all of his personal problems (he is human, after all), there's no denying he was a very talented performer.",1250380800,,4295,4.472541507024266

2353118,5,B000A2RRF4,"I am an unabashed Michael Jackson fan and am STILL struggling to process the fact that he is no longer of this earth.  That being said, Michael will forever be OUT OF THIS WORLD!  This concert (partially lip-synched or not) is FANTASTIC.  To revel in Michael's total performance is the payoff.  This totally (IMMACULATELY) choreographed Michael-fest is so worth it! Dancing/singing/lip-synching / ALL of what takes place on this video smorgasbord is a wonder to behold. Other reviewers comment on the lip-synching.  But, considering all the other performing that he is doing over the course of TWO HOURS, Michael was smart enough to know that the singing would suffer--so he wisely (and sparingly) integrated some lip-synching to HIS OWN VOICE.  I say this simply reaffirms the genius in him and his commitment to giving his fans the ultimate in entertainment.  The playlist for this concert is a retrospective of his greatest hits performed with creative aplomb.  Perhaps some of the editing could have been done differently; but it does not at all detract from the Great One's all-out performance.  The DVD is one that will serve as a visual memorial to the world's greatest entertainer.  I say: by all means GET THIS ONE.",1250035200,,1224,4.985221674876847

When he was doing this concert I was one year old so of course I didn't get to see him live, but this is the next best thing.
And all along the only thing that I could think of was ""WOW"" my mouth dropped when the concert began, and I couldn't halt smiling.
Michael is a phenomenon himself, and this concert is utterly phenomenal!

Then at the end of the DVD I begin to sense a loneliness and a profound feeling of melancholy, simply because I know that we will never see him again performing, and noone will EVER achieve that congruous greatness he delivered. He was truly blessed.

Truly one of a kind.",1249948800,,634,4.364406779661017

As a young teenager I saw him perform with his brothers and sisters as the Jackson's and even then Michael was amazing and had a stage presence like no other.  In this video, Michael will captivate you and will leave you yearning for more when the video comes to an end.

This is fantastic footage, he is a phenominal performer, the best ever, and I think very few in the world can hold a candle up to his performances. No one can be compared, and this will truely show our children and grand children what an amazing entertainer MJ was.
From crying on stage every time he performs that song, is so REAL, there is no acting. I read comments of Quincy Jones that everytime MJ sing's that song, he cries for real, and he (QJ) has never come accross a singer that can put ALL that emotion into his music, so people, so you know, his crying is no ACT!!!! Enjoy this, I hope they will do DVD's of all his world tours......all 3......and AEG is putting out end of OCT the last tour practices (This is it) Can't wait.

Someone mentioned about the lip-synched, I think it's not even a tiny problem to complain.  He was singing non stop for more than 2 hours and not mention all the dance routines,  and some of the songs have lead voice, back-up voice, and hee hee... which all normaly done by Michael himself, so he had to either lip synched or sung over a recorded track.  Any one who doesn't like it then try to scream and jump around for an hour (not even sing, just scream), if you are still alive then get in line and sue Michael's estate for lip synched (about 3 1/2 songs out of 18 songs) in live concert.  The only thing I found strange about the concert is there was no Dangerous song and it was a Dangerous tour.  But anyway I still love it and actually (accidently) bought it twice (this DVD and the one in a box set).  This DVD is proven that Michael Jackson is the best entertainer that ever lived.",1249862400,4,991,4.23404255319149

He hit all the major songs flawlessly & I am awestruck all over again.  I will miss Michael, but I can now see him anytime with this DVD!!! What a musical genuis and talent!
I am excitely awaiting Michael's DVD concert in Japan, ordered also from Amazon (which is a great site).

Buy this DVD and you will fall in love all over again!!!!!  Oh yeah, there is a surprise ending that is pretty freakin awesome too!!!!!!",1249776000,2,710,4.1838235294117645
2353137,4,B000A2RRF4,"I grew when Michael Jackson was the king of the world. He was everywhere and could do no wrong but I was never really a huge fan. After watching this amazing performance however I can now see why he is and always will be `the king of pop' No one can top him when it comes to putting on an incredible show. His expertise and stage presence is simply mesmerising and I must give him props. Plus watching the audience absolutely freak out here is pretty entertaining too.

This concert takes place in Bucharest Romania during the Dangerous Tour and at the height of his popularity in 1992. And except for the cheesy clothing and hairstyles (particularly on the back up dancers) you can barely tell that this concert is now almost 20 years old. The dance moves and music still feel fresh and exciting. MJ performs most of his mainstream hits for the better part of 2 hours in such a way that this show feels like a combination of stage musical and rock concert. Complete with outtakes of music videos including McCauley Culkin and Black Panther, glow in the dark skeletons and coffins (Thriller) and absolutely astounding dance routines (of course.) The audience is insane and almost as much fun to watch as the show itself; screaming, crying, passing out and being taken out by security. At one point Jackson attempts to enter the audience and I was actually scared for him thinking they're going to tear him apart. Its amazing stuff, one forgets just how popular he was back in the day.

My only gripe would be the sound. Michaels vocals sometimes fade in and out, usually at the beginning of a song even though the back-up singers and crowd always sound fine. There's also a considerable amount of lip-synching although that may have something to do with the werewolf costume or all the musical theatre going on. Other than that as a `non-fan' I can highly recommend watching this concert as you will definitely come away with an appreciation for this performer whether you like him or not. I'm just sorry now that I never got to see him live.

Songs included; Main Title, Jam, Wanna be Startin Something, Human Nature, Smooth Criminal, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, She's Out Of My Life, I Want You Back/The Love Save, I'll Be There, Black Or White, Heal The World, and Man In The Mirror.",1249776000,,2288,4.602941176470588

This is a testament of his great talent. He has all his great songs and the fans add life to the show and reveal how real the depths of their love is for him. If you want to buy a concert video you will never tire of, I suggest this one. It breaks your heart though when you see this immense talent, and now it is gone.

His performance here shows his growth as true genius.  Yes there is some lipsyncing; however, those selections are done intermitently to give the man an opportunity to refuel. Nonstop entertainment! I thank Katherine and Joe Jackson and God for creating a beautiful force that the world has reckoned with and will continue to reckon with for years to come.",1249171200,,516,4.648351648351649
2353191,4,B000A2RRF4,"This was a very enjoyable DVD with alot of his greatest hits.  I wish he would have played more songs from Dangerous like Give In To Me, Dangerous or In The Closet since he was promoting that CD at the time.

The flashing of all of the crazy fans was alittle too much, they should have focused more on MJ's foot work and dancing than this.

Still a must have for any fan to see a master of the stage.",1249171200,4,400,3.975

I'm not a MJ fan but I remember I had this concert on VHS and I had to have it on DVD, selection of songs is pretty good.
You won't be disappointed with the show, Michael Jackson was a true genius and this DVD shows why he is the king of pop.
Amazing performer!.",1249084800,,408,3.927710843373494
2353215,5,B000A2RRF4,"Michael Jackson is an absolute genius.  If you've never seen him in concert, and even if you have, this DVD is a must buy.  Once you witness him in action ~ live in concert ~ you'll understand why he truly is the King of Pop.  His incredible and brilliant talent, both as a dancer, singer and performer, will literally take your breath away. His stage presence and sex appeal is amazing. I was a fan of his music for years, but never really appreciated him as a dancer/performer until I watched this DVD.  Now, I can't stop watching it.  The entire performance is incredible but my personal favorites include the opening act of ""Jam"" (jaw dropping dancing), ""Human Nature"", ""Will You Be There"" and ""Man in the Mirror"".  He's a musical genusis. Michael will be sorely missed but never, ever forgotten.  May he rest in peace.",1249084800,,823,4.595890410958904

Do not fast forward a thing, or leave the room without pausing because you just may miss an amazing moment and this concert is chock full of 'em!  There is of course, plenty of lip-synching...which we can understand with all of the incredible dance but he is often singing live OVER his tracks which makes it much better. The highlight of this concert for me is Man in the Mirror....the finale....the exclamation, is when he does his famous ""tornado spin,"" which until this concert I was positive was just trick photography in his videos.  People.....your jaw will DROP!  He then begins singing 100% live, and it's the best part of the song. The voice, the SOUL, is absolutely echanting and gives me goosebumps everytime. No one can sing with such passion!",1248998400,2,918,4.648148148148148

2353218,5,B000A2RRF4,"... is one of the very few concerts, where you can actually experience the dedication and emotionality of Michael jackson fans to the truest of moments. I strongly disagree regarding the many shots of the crying, hysteric fans: That's how it was with Michael Jackson appearing on stage. In this particular case you need to remember, that the concert took place in Bucharest, Romania, which was at that time just a few years of the leash of the Ceaucesco regime (very bad and darkest hour in the history of Romania). They were basically dried out regarding those kind of events, or better put: they never had them before; and Michael Jackson was indeed a visitor from ""outer space"", bringing the unbelievable to their doorsteps - and they show it: pure celebration of happiness, sometimes to the extreme, but who could blame them.

I always get goosebumps from the first two minutes, when he is being catapulted on stage and reigns it in rains of fire, standing with no motion, and his fans shout him, no, they pump him up with cheer. And then suddenly, with the song ""Jam"", the whole mass of people starts to move. That's unforgetable, and I envy anyone who experienced this at the 1992 tour.",1248912000,,1192,4.70334928229665
2353219,4,B000A2RRF4,"Picked this up today as a new MJ fan curious about his live performances, and in this respect, the DVD doesn't disappoint. The performances are of course energetic and a hell of a lot of fun. Good picture quality for a 1992 source, as well. There are a few downsides, however. At times the editing is so manic that it becomes hard to appreciate what is actually happening onstage. It's at its worst near the beginning of the concert, but I became less aware of choppiness later on. Additionally, the repeated cutaways to swooning members of the audience being hauled off by security is borderline ridiculous. I got a kick out of it the first few times, but I saw it again, and again, and again... Throughout the entire concert. Distracting and annoying.

The ""stunt"" at the end of the concert was jaw-droppingly stupid. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but I guess that's the early nineties for you!

The weaknesses overall don't take away from really positive presentation of MJ in his prime. The power of performance this man had is unmatched. While there is some lip-syncing, Michael lends his own voice on several songs. Recommended.",1248652800,3,1149,4.768844221105527
2353220,3,B000A2RRF4,Very disappointed with this DVD. Way too focused on the hysterical audience instead of MJ's performance.  Too much lip syncing on MJ's part also.,1248393600,3,145,5.041666666666667
2353221,5,B000A2RRF4,This is the best concert video I have ever seen my only regret is that I did not witness Michael perform in person either alone or with his brothers. Just fantastic!,1248393600,2,165,4.354838709677419

he gives his backups the stage, acknowledges his brothers at one point and one girl had her day when he took her on stage to dance and hug her...i wonder what she is doing today 17 years later?

enjoy enjoy enjoy!  and definitely buy - if not for yourself for your kids to have....he is a legend and there truly will be no one else like him.  bigger than the beatles...",1248393600,2,816,4.1923076923076925

I saw them perform live in LA at the Forum.  After that I moved around a lot so I never got to see Michael perform solo.  I regret that, but I'm proud to say I'm still a fan.  This concert is awesome and well worth buying and watching.  If you can't see his  talent, you just aren't paying attention.  I recommend this DVD.  My only question... this was the Dangerous tour... and yet.. Michael never performed ""Dangerous"" during the concert... however it's still worth owning.",1248220800,3,648,4.38655462184874
2353234,4,B000A2RRF4,"This program was recorded October 1, 1992 and became the stamp of approval solidifying the legendary status of the King of Pop. Michael Jackson's ""Live in Bucharest"" is a triumph. Watching this presentation literally pulls you into the screen. The stirring power of this personality oozes throughout the concert. One of the most memorable parts of the concert showcases Siedah Garrett (background singer and writer of ""Man In The Mirror"") sharing the stage with him on ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You."" This duet, as passionate as it was, transitions into ""She's Out Of My Life."" He calls a female audience member on stage and she's in awe of this mere mortal on stage to the point where she had to be carried off the stage by the event security. WOW! This stage technique has often been duplicated by the likes of Bobby Brown, Usher, Justin Timberlake and many artists after MJ blazed the trail for other known performers. Overall, The Dangerous Tour is Michael's finest performance since the Bad World Tour in 1987. The sound quality could have been better, but nothing can diminish the precision & timing of the dancers, the quality professionalism of the band and singers spearheaded by Greg Phillinganes & Brad Buxer on keys and the rhythms of the great Ricky Lawson. As a footnote, this was a pioneering concert in which the producers utilized on stage ProTools editing with added vocal & musical programming, a proponent that is widely used today in various live shows and stage presentations. (All hail Bruce Swedien!) I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this energetic masterpiece. Rest In Peace, MJJ! You were a supernova! A true gift and an icon to this society!

2353235,5,B000A2RRF4,"I grew up in the 80s and my first album I ever bought was Michael Jackson's BAD. I've been a fan ever since and just recently bought this DVD for nostalgia. I was dancing through most of it, but ended up in tears crying by the end. Watching this concert again (saw it when it was on HBO) on DVD now made me realize why I loved his music so much and what a talent that's been lost. During the song ""Heal the World"", I actually had to leave the room because the tears were starting to flow. A beautiful song from a really great performer. All of those memories of me listening to his music as a kid really came back and the thought of his death really hit me hard in those few minutes of the song. The good news is that his music will live on in my life and the life of every other fan and fan to be that will discover his music in the future. It brings nothing but good memories. Way worth buying. :)",1248220800,5,899,3.972375690607735

I bought this DVD prompted by a death that caught me by surprise and saddened me very deeply. I had so much hoped Michael would make a comeback and show off his great talent to the whole world once again. When I realized this would never happen, I thought buying his DVDs was the best thing that was left for me to do. I started watching as soon as it arrived and I sat there, in front of the television, unable to move, trying not to miss the slightest detail, unwilling even to stretch out my arm to grab a glass of orange juice sitting on the table next to me. From beginning to end this concert is a stunner. Michael Jackson's phenomenal talent, charisma, charm, professionalism, elegance are right there for us to rejoice. I had seen Michael on other videos and he had always charmed me but this particular concert is so good that I cannot imagine anything better. Together with Michael's unique art, the brilliant musicians, singers and dancers that toured with him marveled me. ""Smooth criminal"" is one example of what a group of outstanding professional singers and dancers can contribute to a show like this one. I am so glad I purchased this DVD. Thank you so much, Michael Jackson, for all you have given us. You are unique, the best there has ever been, the best there will ever be.

 We watched this and From the JUMP-- WOW!!  For a 2 hour DVD-- it seemed like minutes.. it just Flew by and was probably one of the Best DVD concerts I have ever watched...and I have several.
 Move the furniture and Make some room around you, because it is not possible to just sit and watch--You Will want to move...have the Audio run through surround sound if possible.
Back to the DVD ...From beginning to end.. the song selection even for the Not so faithful fan like myself are all recognizable and done extremely well with the show sets enhancing the performances. I plan on watching this DVD Several more times. I cannot imagine this ever getting tired.

I bought it because I had never witnessed a full MJ concert. You owe this to your self. I read someone elses review here when purchasing this. Of whom said, that they showed more of the audience than the band. I have to disagree with that. This video was shot with marvelous balance of both. It really gave me the full experience of being there and seeing the show. Michael is in good voice. His dance moves for THE ENTIRE SHOW are nothing less than amazing. His band was tight. So many messages in this concert. The Energy never fell. He slowed down and demonstrated that he was still a crooner. I was tired at the end of this show! Every dollar this man had, HE EARNED!!

Done from Bucharest (which I thought was in Germany but I've been told it is in Romania. Thanks to Flyguy for the information!), Michael Jackson had the people cheering and falling out from start to finish. I have rarely seen an individual who had the crowd screaming by....just standing there! He stood their forever and the folks were going wild. One he got going with the show, the cheers never really let up at all!

He performs some of his best hits up to that point (nothing from the HIStory CD because it wasn't actually out when he did this concert). From ""Beat It"", ""Wanna Be Starting Something"", ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"", ""Human Nature"" and other songs. It ends with his ""Man In The Mirror"" song with an ending worthy of MJ!

2353291,5,B000A2RRF4,"I have seen Michael Jackson on television but never in a live performance.  This DVD puts you up front and close for the concert and it is AWESOME! Unfortunetely I bought the DVD posthumously and it saddens me when I remember this unvelievable talent is no longer alive.  But, watching the DVD does keep MJ alive, full of energy and music. His dancing is mesmerizing and his foot work is unbelievable. The staging, the pyrotechnics, the constumes, the musicians, back up dancers.....all left me breathless. Any collection of Michael Jackson CDs/DVDs must include a live performance and I highly recommend this concert.  You won't be disappointed and if you've never been an MJ fam you will be after you see this performance. He was and is the master of live entertainment and will always be the King of Pop. The DVD is amazing!!",1247443200,6,828,4.776223776223776
2353302,5,B000A2RRF4,"This DVD starts out with an amazing opening where Michael blasts up through the floor and lands on stage...and just stands in his position as the crowd goes insane at the sight of the legendary superstar, all studded out and ready to perform.

After watching this, I later learned this was the 69th show he had done on this tour.  I'm amazed at how much energy he has to dance through all these songs.  On a few songs like Human Nature he is trying to save his voice and this is well noted as it is the 69th show.  I am blow away he was able to perform like this after so many concerts.

The second to last song Heal the World..is very touching as Michael tenderly  leads little children out to the stage.  You can see how his face lights up when looking at the kids and his love for children is apparent here.  He kisses a little toddler and the look in his face is radiating love.

We have lost a great singer, entertainer, musical genius who loved people and cared about children and the world more than he loved himself.",1247443200,13,1024,4.2642487046632125
2353303,5,B000A2RRF4,"From beginning to end, MJ mesmerizes the audience.  He never stops moving throughout the entire concert.. his feet are amazing... his creativity is second to none.  I'm slightly infatuated with MJ after watching him non-stop for two hours!!  And I'm also sad because he's now gone and will never be able to be on top like he was during this time in his career.  He does do some lip-syncing during the concert, mainly for songs that he does a lot of dancing to.  I don't understand why he sang along with himself on songs such as Heal The World and Man In The Mirror because he didn't dance during these...  he could have sung live.  The most impressive song of all is Working Day and Night.  He sings LIVE, never stops moving, and does about five encores because he's ""not ready"" to end the song, he says.. It's an absolute blast to watch.  The only disappointing aspect of the DVD comes at the very end when, during the ""stunt,"" it's not him during take-off.... and the set-up, as other have commented on, is way too long -- especially when it's not even him blasting off.

No matter what went on in the mind and life of this incredible entertainer, that's not our business or judgement to make.  He was a musical genius and innovator, and he will be terribly missed.  There is no doubt that in EVERY aspect of his life, he ENTERTAINED.  But he entertained most on stage, doing what he loved to do.  The joy of entertaining showed in his face when he was introducing his band members, how he was appreciative of the musicians, and it is obvious that they loved him as well.  Buy the DVD so that you can see The Man in his prime, doing what he does best.  He's magical.",1247356800,6,1669,4.387622149837133
2353304,5,B000A2RRF4,I watched this concert on DVD last night for the first time since it originally aired in 1992 and it was just as powerful. Michael Jackson's live performances are better than any video he's ever done. What a master!,1247356800,,215,4.538461538461538
2353305,5,B000A2RRF4,"This concert was performed and recorded in 1992 with Michael Jackson at around 33 years of age and definitely in his prime.
I only bought this DVD after he passed away as I was expecting to buy a DVD of his upcoming tour as one of the shows would have been recorded for sure. After seeing this one, I too, couldn't believe I waited this long to acquire it !
Don't expect high definition sound and picture quality like some reviewers, but in saying that, the picture and sound quality of this show are more than acceptable, in fact still very good.
The line up of songs is terrific and are performed with incredible intensity and emotion. The guy definitely sings most of the songs and if there was any lip synching in parts, it was not obvious to me. I was not put off by other comments on this matter.
Yes, there are shots of people passing out and being taken away, right from the start of the first song - what a waste of money for them ! And what a crowd - massive in size and all overawed by the occasion. I actually felt these shots added interest and really helped give the viewer a feel for the whole event. The only time audience shots were a little overdone, was probably during ""Man In The Mirror"" at the end of the concert where we see no less than six people being carted out of the arena. Overall I felt the balance between stage and audience shots was pretty good.
If this is the only full live concert filmed and likely to be released on DVD of this talented man, then buy it, enjoy it, don't look for faults in it and appreciate the guy at his best !
Hopefully we will see a DVD of his rehearsals for the 2009 tour with over 100 hours being taped - who knows.
Michael Jackson, you will be sorely missed !",1247270400,12,1721,4.2024169184290034

There is NO ONE like him nor will there ever be again. He is pure talent and holds male and female in the palm of his hand when he performs.

I can't say enough about this DVD. And I can't believe I didn't own it until now.

Rest in peace my Brother. I miss you and love you.",1247184000,6,477,3.9479166666666665
2353309,5,B000A2RRF4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD!  Amazing dancing, singing, and a great assortment of favorite Michael Jackson hits.  Great use of illusion throughout the show with a great stunt at the closer :)  I noticed there are complaints about the amount of audience shots shown, including way too many fainting and getting carted off by paramedics.  I agree with this, but luckily after the first few songs that dies way down (as does the crotch grabbing that annoys some people), but there is another resurgence of fainters during Man in the Mirror at the end.  Also I'm surprised how many people said there was lip syncing, to the point where I was expecting most of the show would be that way.  However, the only song that seemed there was lip syncing was Thriller, and that was due to the fact he wears a wolf mask half way through I'd imagine!  Possibly there were a couple more, but for the most part it was clearly live singing and he was FANTASTIC!  I was about to list my favorite moments, but I realized I'd have to list half the set list!!  HIGHLY recommended, as Michael Jackson was an amazing performer who will be very missed!",1246924800,7,1129,4.5495049504950495

2353311,5,B000A2RRF4,"I was a fan of Michael Jackson when I was young, I had several of his albums, and I loved it. In my teen years I faded out of his music, but have been getting back into it recently. I never had this video as a child, but I'm glad to have it now. The show it approx. 2 hours long, and it's a great 2 hours. There are several costume changes, wonderful classic MJ dancing (which means incredible) and even some awesome sets. Since this video was recorded in 1992 you get to go back and remember Michael when he was at a high point of fame. Now having him with all the sex stuff and how weird he has become known for, it's such a change to see him back then. The video is complete with frantic fans, crying fans, and fainting fans! It is kind of scary to watch girls crying their eyes out over the very appearance of Michael, and fainting! There is a one second part where within the first two songs you see a girl who has fainted and a security guard is slapping her on the face repeatedly, trying to wake her up, but it doesn't work. You have to feel a bit bad for these fans because they go to a concert, and don't make in 2 songs in before they faint, and miss the rest of the concert! At one point you see an amazing split-second switch as a girl is taken from the crowd and guided up to have Michael sing to her and she is in total awe and peaceful and hugging Michael and all is safe, then the guards try to take her away and in a split second she goes from peaceful, to frantic! Aside from the fan shots though it really is an amazing performance, the ending is a little long as a crew is brought on stage to put Michael in some sort of jet pack so he can fly off the stage. It takes several minutes and kind of slows down what could be a really cool ending.",1245283200,18,1763,3.983050847457627

I wanted to be her, thigh high boots and all...I'm still perplexed by my past infatuation with the man in the mirror but apparently most of the women and some of the men at the concert felt the same....wait this is a review of the concert...it's theatrical, entertaining and it proves why countless people watched this when it aired on cable. Some have said that he appears to be lip-syncing, I think this is somewhat true. I think that Michael is singing over a voice track because there are multiple times in which it appears as if he is singing live. I think that this can account for the slight echo of his voice. It's MJ and the track at the same time. Lip-syncing or not it's a darn good show, so watch it anyway.",1243641600,10,895,4.333333333333333

2353345,5,B000A2RRF4,This DVD is the recording of one of the concerts from the Bad Tour by Michael Jackson. The show itself is great.

2353347,3,B000A2RRF4,"As a kid in the 1980's (like pretty much everyone on the planet at that time) I was a MJ fan. The first album I ever bought with my own money was Michael Jackson's ""Bad"". Then I went backwards from there, got my hands on ""Off The Wall"" and ""Thriller"". I lost interest around ""Dangerous"", to put it bluntly, because of his exceedingly bizarre physical appearance and ""Earth Song with a children's choir and angels"" -type performances.

I still think he's a type of genius, and a brilliant pop songwriter (not to mention lead singer, background singer and dancer), who made pop history together with Quincy Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton.

Not much live material exists of MJ's concerts, which is a shame. So I went in with an open mind, anxious, having read all the positive reviews of this DVD. Now, when reading this, keep in mind that it's coming from someone who appreciates the man, not from a ""hater"".

In short - I wasn't impressed. First of all, there's obviously quite a lot of lip syncing and playback, especially noticeable on ""Black Or White"". You can REALLY easily tell when Jackson is singing live, especially early on in the concert, because his notes fall FLAT, when he's singing live, really often. I've noticed this on a lot of live clips I've seen of him, that he really isn't at his best singing live, I don't know if it's the (enormously physical burden of) dance moves that take their toll, but that's how it is. Still, at least he didn't MURDER a song like Siedah Garrett did during ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"", she was so out of tune and off-key that it hurt.

Second - showing the screaming, crying, hysterical, fainting kids over and over again was REALLY unnecessary. Yeah, we get it, MJ's a super star and he has the craziest fans. Would've been ok to show it maybe once. Then again, the cameras managed to get some nice shots once in a while, like the happy hat-wearing girl during ""Billie Jean"".

Third - the performance of ""Human Nature""...was just...bizarre. He was barely singing it (I think he messed up the lyrics as well), just making these orgasmic noises and performing a truly strange jerky dance routine in what looked like a golden corset.

Fourth - and sure enough, we got the children's choir and angel imagery as well. He had a bad case of Jesus complex in the 1990's.

Still ... the dancing was as impressive as ever, the moonwalk on ""Billie Jean"" still amazingly cool after almost two decades, and some of the performances simply kicked a**, like ""Smooth Criminal"".",1236816000,8,2517,4.630044843049327
2353348,5,B000A2RRF4,"Michael Jackson meant for the eighties and nineties what Elvis Presley in the middle sixties, a pop icon, a privileged artist who was well aware what it means to have a crowd in the fist. Every single movement at the stage, the suggestive corporal language and the seductive charisma generates a real magic at the stage, an ambiance of bliss, liberation and happiness.

This admirable recital proves by far, this magic, supported by a first-rate technology and clever musical numbers that captured your attention from start to finish.

The special tracks were ""Thriller"" (of course), the sensitive ballad ""She's out of my life""  ""Beating"" and the delirious ""Heal the world"" where the presence of children of all latitudes of the world (having as background the sphere of the world) tinged the stage of warm humanity.

A real tour de force that exposes and resumes the artistic essence of this idol of crowds.",1235952000,2,908,4.953947368421052

I recorded it on VHS of course, but someone lifted my tape years ago and I have been hoping over the years for a DVD release. So I finally got my DVD a few months ago. I finally watched it with my Thanksgiving guests. (I have now have to order 2 more DVDs) The performances have certainly withstood the test of time. Because screens were smaller in '92, I didn't notice how much lip-synching was involved. In '92 I marvelled at how MJ's vocals were so strong considering his continous choreography.  Watching on my 60"" TV, I no longer have to marvel at that. :(.  But to be totally fair, singer/dancers all have back up vocals to help them through their dance routines.

2353413,4,B000A2RRF4,"The 1992 HBO concert (and frequent subsequent VH1 staple) finally comes to DVD, available by itself for the first time (and just in the nick of time for those of us still viewing our 15 year-old VHS tapes, that probably have more glitches and grain on them than any self-respecting fan would ever deal with).  Time has not been too kind to this show (unlike the album the concert supports, which I hadn't come to truly appreciate until recent years - it, I think, was ahead of its time -  this show feel somewhat dated), but it still boasts a large number of standout performances and several of Jackson's awe-inspiring moves.  The setlist is great (though you almost wish there were more hits represented; however to fit all of MJ's hits in one show, the guy would have to be on stage for 5 hours), so is the dancing and the theatrics.  Less than stellar is the lip-synching on many songs (although given his huff-and-puff performance of ""Billie Jean,"" maybe lip-synching is necessary for some performers) and endless shots of crying, fainting fans (although, if you could make 20 people per show do that, I bet you'd make a point of showing it off on your DVD).

This is the only Michael Jackson live DVD available.  Simply to have a document of why he is considered to be the ultimate performer is reason enough to say this is a must addition to any true rock `n roll library.  However, it is flawed in some respects and much of the shenanigans feel dated.  A too-bass-heavy sound mix doesn't help.  But Jackson's solo spotlight dance on ""Billie Jean"" (vocal performance aside) is reason all by itself to own this baby.  ""Smooth Criminal"" is also a performance highlight.

If you plan to pick this one up, do yourself a favor and, instead of spending 15 to 20 bucks on this, pay up another 10 or 15 and grab ""The Ultimate"" box set from two years ago.  This DVD is included there along with four other CD's of Jackson hits, B-Sides, and Jackson 5/Jackson era jams.  It is simply the better buy, especially since it now sells for about $30 at Best Buy (last week they had it on sale for $20).

I see people here at Amazon are fairly divided on this release, as they seem to be about Jackson himself.  However, most agree he is still a mesmerizing performer and just can't help but watch him perform.  If this DVD doesn't do it for you, then I recommend both ""Dangerous:  The Short Films"" (like the album, this DVD also feels ahead of its time in that it came out originally on VHS back in the early 90s when these type of releases were basically just a bunch of videos, this one has the videos built around all sorts of other stuff:  news footage, award appearances, and has videos you may have never scene on MTV; its like a scrapbook of everything he did during that album's reign - it should be required that any band and their producer watch this before just throwing together a bunch of videos for a DVD compilation) and ""HIStory on Film:  Volume II,"" which includes a lot of the best stuff that was already on  the first volume (""Thriller,"" ""Beat It,"" etc), but also all the great stuff they left off the first volume (like the full 40-minute ""Smooth Criminal"" video, the infamous ""Billie Jean"" Motown 25 performance, and newer stuff as recent as that DVDs release in 1997, like ""Blood on the Dance Floor,"" which i still say is a great, underrated Jackson track).",1165017600,8,3370,4.511513157894737
2353443,5,B000A2RRF4,"Yesterday. I enter Circuit City at Union Square in NYC with my wife, who is from Japan, and this DVD is on three modestly sized plasma TVs a the top of the escalator--which is crowded with mesmorized viewers.

We could not help it.  The show was so awesome that we found ourselves standing there, entranced.

My wife put it correctly when she said to me in Japanese, ""Whatever he does in life, people will always be facinated with his performances,"" meaning no matter what freakish things he does to or with his body, it just plain won't effect the fact that he truly is the King of Pop (though I must then appoint Prince as the Emperor of Pop--sorry Michael).

That really summed it up; we were watching one of the all time great masters of performance, and indeed were lucky to be alive when his career was in full swing.

Michael Jackson is one of the all time greats--like Harry Houdini, Fred Astaire, Jimmy Hendrix, or Miles Davis.  He's a master of the stage, and--though I protest with myself--has a fantastic musical ability that can't help but mesmorize.

On this DVD, there is of course a lot of lip synching.  This isn't so much a music concert as a stage show.  And as a stage show, it's one of the greatest of all time.  Just seeing Jackson dance to his own music is worth your money.

*****There was one musical break that was facinating, though it wasn't performed by Jackson.  At one point in the performance, he shares the stage with a solo guitarist--apparrently just for effect--but the guitarist completely takes over the stage.  Jackson points him out to a stage hand, who tries to stop the solo, and the guitarist just keeps going with a fantastic, mad, crazy solo.

It's pretty rare to see a solo like that unless you're in the biz.  I immediately thought of Mike Stern--who this was not--totally dominating the show.  Jackson should have let him go a bit longer, but instead started the next bit and had the guitarist's plug pulled.

Bottom Line: I suppose that says a lot about Jackson's way of performing--he's a perfectionist; it's all planned out, and it follows the plan exactly.  Other performers would have played counterpoint to that solo (as the guitarist was starting to do when Jackson 'interrupted), shared the limelight, and acknowledged that this is what musical performance is really all about--that there's really no such thing as a solo artist, unless of course you're Michael Jackson.

Anyway, I can't help but give this DVD 5 stars on sheer greatness.",1156291200,193,2494,4.691954022988506

I am a huge Michael Jackson fan.  This dvd is a must have if you love Michael.  In the dvd Michael sings all his number one hits completely.  Micheal is a true one man show.  He sings and dance the entire time.  The dvd is worth every penny and MORE!!!

He is probably one of the most spectacular entertainers of our time.  I hope he comes out with something soon.  I still can't forget the way he sang, ""She's Out of My Life"" , it was really emotional.  You could feel what he was saying.  As another reviewer said, I did think the jet pack exit was tight.  Who else would have done it the way he did?  Nobody!!!!  No one can ever compare to this man.  There are a lot of wannabe's, but there's only one MICHAEL JACKSON.

2353448,3,B000A2RRF4,"Live in Bucharest showed Michael Jackson's incredible talent to perform-but not to perform. Anybody that really knows the ""70's and 80's Michael Jackson"" can relate to what I am saying. I'm talking before ""Thriller"".

-Back in the day, -This guy could make dance moves so fast that you'd wish you had a slow motion button in your brain.-His voice sounded amazing, soulful, and REAL. Listen to ""I can't help it"" on the ""Off The Wall"" LP. -and then, -you will hear the real MICHAEL JACKSON!! -This song is remarkable, underated and unknown to most of Michael Jackson true fans. This song is a hidden gem. With out ""Off the Wall"" there could have been no ""Thriller"". But between these two land mark recordings, something happened.

-WHAT??-I'll tell you, It was MONEY and FAME!!

The Victory, Bad, Dangerous, and History tours, all pale in comparison to the Mexico, Destiny and Triumph tours. Give me the young Michael Jackson anyday of the week; The old Michael Jackson (Bucharest) seems to have too much trouble singing live withoout help (Human Nature, Billie Jean). Sure, his dance steps are inventive, but they lack raw power on stage, mainly because of his goofy looking background dancers!!

Simply because I have the original recording of the Bucharest tour when it came on HBO 13 years ago. A friend of mine had HBO at the time and recorded it and let me borrow it. Well, 13 years later I still have it so I don't need the DVD. I crack up every time I want to see a certain performance and the people in the audience cry and scream and faint, and pass out all over the place.

2353484,3,B000A2RRF4,"I love some Michael Jackson songs. I was very excited when I bought this DVD as I tought I was going to hear some of my favorite Michael Jackson's songs played live. I was wondering how good did Michael sing his songs live hoping to find a new interest in these alredy beloved songs. I am dissapointed at the lack of quality singing by Michael. Of course, you can't ask for much as he is always dancing and jumping and when he gets to sing he is very excited, his heart beating fast so you can imagine the results: he hardly sings, the chorists always have to complete Michael's singing. Another dissapointing fact is the constant shots of people going into euphoria and fainting like if they saw God. It is really disturbing. This is a must have DVD for any Michael Jackson fan as it is the only live DVD of him available, but for the casual fan like me you should know that instead of seeing Michael Jackson actually SINGING you will see him dancing, shouting, touching himself alongs with obsessed fans needing medical attention. Some performances in this DVD like Billy Jean, Thriller are remarkable good tough. I say go for it just don't expect a whole singing performance rather than a dancing, touching himself performance.",1134950400,15,1230,4.621004566210046

Also, Jackson kept on crotch-grabbing which she thinks he went too far.

Also, we saw that several shots were not from Bucharest. I saw London Monza Paris Lausanne Toulouse blah blah. Why couldn't the footage shot be only on Bucharest itself",1133481600,2,533,4.383838383838384

2353487,5,B000A2RRF4,"I actually went to a live Dangerous Concert at Roundhay Park, Leeds, England.  The concert was amazing and one of the most important moments of my life.  Michael was sensational, not only does he move, sing and dance like no one else but he transforms the whole arena with his incredible stage presence.  You are literally seeing one of the best performers on stage ever, if not the best!

It would be difficult to capture this brilliance on DVD, not to mention the atmosphere but I would say the Bucharest Dangerous concert DVD comes very close.  I have watched it numerous times and even now it brings out all kinds of emotions.  The quality is excellent and you get to see the magnificence of Michael Jackson plus the astonishing reactions from the crowd so you can literally feel the atmosphere.

This concert is quite simply a point in history, a time when a musician could bring out pure emotion in a crowd through excellence in music and dance.

Buy this, you won't see a better artist in concert and I guarantee anyone who takes a chance on this will be a fan.  I became one after the Dangerous Concert in Leeds and I've been to many more concerts since.  He never fails to please.  Highly recommended!

2353509,3,B000A2RRF4,"I think overall this concert is good. The visuals & dancing are top notch. The performance is let down though because Michael doesnt sing many of his songs live. He lip syncs Smooth Criminal, Will You Be there, Thriller, Black or White, Heal The World & Man in the mirror.

  When he does sing live it all seems a bit forced and he sounds like he's straining his voice & his tone & notes suffer greatly because of it (as if he's worn it out over the years or as a result of his surgery!), this is very apparent when he's singing Wanna Be Starting something, Human Nature, Billie Jean, Working Day & Night & Beat It. His best live vocal performances in the concert are I Just Cant Stop Loving You (Sahida Garrat was rubbish though!), She's out of my life & The Jackson 5 medley.

  While the overall performance was good, it pales in comparison to his previous Bad Tour - that was MJ at his best (especially in the first leg in Japan) where he sung live while doing all the crazy dance moves, and still sounded good! The dancing was much more fluent and polished to pristine. Im really routing for The Bad tour to be released soon. Give the fans what they want and show the rest of the world how good MJ was in the late 80's!

This is recommended for fans accross the extremity spectrum, adding to your collection & people who want to see a good show.",1124928000,15,1350,4.270588235294118
2353510,3,B000A2RRF4,"Well, i recorded this on video when it aired on HBO, since the video is getting really terrible (its been over a decade), i bought the DVD. I went to see Jackson in 1988 during his Bad Tour, what difference their is in this concert. Even though the set on the stage is better then the Bad Tour, the effort stinks. Lip-syncing drives me mad. The only song i really can stand now from that concert is Smooth Criminal, while still lip-syncing, that damn tilt he does during the song is unbelievable. Thriller is also nicely done, nice set for that song. Now there are songs he actually sings to, Billie Jean is a complete rip-off, besides the impressive dancing (the moonwalk is always entertaining) the singing is almost non-existent from Jackson, you hear the background singers more then you hear him.

One thing is for sure, Michael Jackson was definitely at the peak of his popularity, i've never seen an audience so big. Overall, decent, but for those of us that have seen Jackson in his previous tours, knows he has done better, but this is nice to own, since Sony doesn't like releasing any other live concerts from Jackson.",1124841600,4,1129,4.616915422885572

2353512,4,B000A2RRF4,"In overall I think this dvd should have 3 stars, but when I look at the man dancing like he's fighting for his life, I just can't help myself... But I have to agree with some of the points that the person under me (Gregory B. Callahan) gave. It's nice to read a review from not a die-hard fan or someone who just comes hear to bash Michael Jackson. I am quite a big fan, but I don't buy everything from him (literally also..lol). And exactly.. Mr. Jackson comes with a package. It's not just like you see on this dvd, the hysterical crying fans, it's also all the stuff he has created around him, Im talking about everything but the music. But of course I shouldnt look at that right now, reviewing a dvd from him. To me he is the most amazing entertainer/performer. He is such a unique mover, just mesmerizing to watch. No one does he like he does, did it like he did. But on this dvd after watching a few performance I become easily annoyed by the crying fans. I don't like the way the focus is so much on them, it's like the concert is more about them than the person on stage. I mean, every one knows how crazy a concert can get with this artist, if you're standing in front. So when I watch this dvd I don't feel like I'm watching just a concert. Same with the audio, you hear far too much crowd. When I buy a live-dvd I want to see and hear just the performer and his music. That's what it's all about!

what I'm really waiting for is a release of a Bad Tour concert, especially 1988. The Jackson at this time was just 100% perfect. And the focus was more on the music and the performance... So I'll just keep on waiting...",1123891200,,1629,4.155063291139241
2353513,3,B000A2RRF4,"Now that the court case is over, can we get back to the music?  You might well ask.  However, truth is, in Michael's case, it has never JUST been about the music.  That's why he was/is(?) a superstar.  Much of it is about his charisma, his image (not really the same thing),eccentricities both endearing and off-putting, as well as the music.  You either bought the package or you didn't.

I didn't, actually, which is not to say that I did not recognize Jackson's talent as a singer, dancer and songwriter.  But the last thing I ever bought of his was THRILLER--and then mainly for one song, namely, ""Beat It.""  Yes, the song that impressed me the most was likely the rockiest thing he's ever done.  I liked the sinuous ""Billie Jean"" well enough and the title track was pretty good, but eventually anything with voiceover narration is going to get on my nerves (even if it IS Vincent Price: come to think of it, ESPECIALLY if it's Vincent Price).  But ""Beat It"" really got to the heart of this old rock'n'roller.

What came later didn't particularly move me.  Much of the rest of the 80s and 90s product seemed to be a lot less compelling.  Loads of funk riffs with Jackson singing ""Come on, girl"" and ""whee hee"" on top of it.  OK, but nothing that would really grab you.  Maybe all the crotch grabbing was his way of compensating for the fact the music itself was getting less and less grabbing.

But this filmed concert in Bucharest is interesting.  Agoraphobe that I am, there is absolutely no way I would ever attend a Jackson concert in person (unless his popularity plummets to the point where he starts playing small clubs or something).  So this was as close as I was ever going to get.  And it was fascinating to watch--especially from a sort of antrhopological perspective.  The cameras are constantly panning to the frenzied audience.  There are more crowd shots here than in any concert video or film I've ever seen.  I suppose this is meant to convey the excitement of an actual MJ concert.  (And one has to acknowledge the significance of a big American-style extravaganza in a post-Cold War, former Soviet Bloc country.  That could only have added to the frenzied excitement.)

But frankly, I find it all just a little hard to relate to.  Makes me remember how even when I was a little kid, I didn't understand all those girls screaming at the Beatles.  I wanted to listen to the MUSIC, thank you very much.  Not have some hysteric screaming in my ear.  I guess I'd have to say that the whole superstar trip is pretty much lost on me.  And I'm just as glad.

Which is not to say I don't believe Michael Jackson is talented, maybe even a genius of his genre.  But I found it disturbing almost that even during some of the ballads he felt compelled to keep on with the robo-dance moves, just a little more slo-mo.  Why can't he just stand there and sing, I wondered.  Then it dawned on me.  Well, this concert wasn't meant for viewers (and listeners) like me.  I guess the human race will always demand a certain amount of spectacle, and that's fine, I suppose.  That's show biz--and it can even be art.  If there's steak to go along with the sizzle, that's fine.  With Michael Jackson, even circa 1995, it was about 50/50 in the steak to sizzle ratio, though.

This concert is the example of what pop performances should be, but of course no other pop performance will be on par with this one. This is the greatest performance of all time. How he could make the thousands and thousands of people sing his songs, How he could make them all adlib just like him, with his Hee-Hee's and OWW's. How he could make them all wave their hands from left to right. How he could make thousands of women, AND men, pass out and cry over him. He was magic.. but like many of the greatest in our time, he was brought down by the rest of the world.

2353516,4,B000A2RRF4,"In his prime MJ was at the top of his game and easily one of the best entertainers around. This concert at Bucherst is a timecapsule of the genius that once was. There were only a handful that were on his level (Think Janet,Madonna, & Prince) This was an incredible show and the energy was off the charts. His dancing ...spot on. Hit after hit...the concert could have been a bit longer....but then again look at his extensive catalog of songs to choose from he could have been on stage playing all night. If you like his music and you haven't (or have) not gotten the chance to see him live than this is a must have. It may infact be the only chance (unless other concerts are released) to do so. My Oh my how times have changed the music of lately really s**ks (think AMERICAN IDIOT er i mean idol???) and im not even going to go into the circus that has happened over the past decade but was it media over kill...hateful exemployees doing kiss n tells or (gasp!!!make that double gasp!) could have some of his own actions that has brought this all about...on to him self????? Indeed he may have trusted the wrong people but there is a thing called common sence and the man does have a great intellect other wise the wonderful music he ceated would have never existed....Ok i cant resist one shot What in the blue heck was he thinking dangiling a baby out a window any way???? Ok i vented...now back to the music..and there is plenty of it and for that we are fortunate indeed. But the events of late and all the sorrow may have taken a huge toll on MJ physically and emotionally and one wonders if (and when) he will ever regain the magic that made him one of the worlds most endering entertainers..In that answer im not that optomistic and i wouldnt blame him a bit either. He who has always had a big heart has been more than taken advantage of and regardless of weather or not the charges were true or not and yes he was found NOT GUILTY how could he want to open up and share his world with anyone again. I think if he wants to start the healing he needs to go out on tour and soon if not solo have  a reunion tour with the entire family in concert (and yes include Janet as well). He needs to connect with his fans and stop letting the media making him and his life in to a freak show. Its not right. He needs to (pardon the pun)take Control (sorry janet.)and get his life back in order and as i said on of the best ways of doing that is getting out there and connecting with the fans. But if and when he will (or if ever) we at least will have the treasure trove of great music and finally now a complete MICHAEL JACKSON Concert and these are timeless. Heal the world indeed...but, my how far we all have (and MJ) fallen since then....But none the less sit back  at the only full legnth Michael Jackson ever released- It is a blast and will bring some of that magic back if only for a few moments....",1123200000,,2909,4.220825852782765
