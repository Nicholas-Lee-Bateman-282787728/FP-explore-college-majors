8160811,3,B000LC4CH4,"The pace of all the workouts is very fast (I know they have to pack a lot into just 8 min), but if you don't know much about pilates, it's hard to get an undertanding of proper form for the moves.  My biggest disappointment is minimal difference between levels of difficulty.  This is definitely not like 3 separate workouts - there is a lot of cross-over.",1420848000,,356,4.378787878787879

8160813,5,B000LC4CH4,"This video truley gets the workout done in different 08 min segments. Who doesnt have 08 min's to dedicate to toning your body. Do all of them, only a few or just one piece. It has the exercises that really work in a short period of time.",1355961600,,238,4.085106382978723
8160814,5,B000LC4CH4,"This is a great video, everyone has 8 mins and it really works. I have the 8 min abs also",1327017600,,89,3.5
8160815,5,B000LC4CH4,"feel the burn up to 4 days later. best video for abs. when you are done the video, you don't really feel like you worked out. You feel it the next day for the next couple days.",1295913600,2,176,3.7837837837837838
8160816,4,B000LC4CH4,"This Pilates workout has three levels to choose from, but when I use it I just do all three levels in one workout session.  The :08 min. workout series definitely target certain areas and maximize the results.  This DVD continues that trend.",1291939200,,241,4.714285714285714
8160817,5,B000LC4CH4,"This product is easy to use for someone who is busy. Just pop it in and go with the exercise. They have a great balance between beginner, intermediate, and advanced. The exercises are only 8 minutes long and anyone on the go can spare 8 minutes.",1240617600,,245,4.3478260869565215
8160818,3,B000LC4CH4,"Good routine, but the DVD should have included a couple of routines at each level.  One quick routine at each level does not justify the purchase.",1199577600,5,146,4.615384615384615
8160819,5,B000LC4CH4,"Three of us in our family with a range of skill & fitness all enjoy this program. Just as the title states, the program gives an 8 minute Pilates exercise program. There are actually 3 programs at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels.  I do the program occasionally - only a few times a month to add to my routine;  my wife and son regularly.  I am one who needs motivation to stay up with my exercise;  a benefit of this is: who can claim they don't have 8 minutes!  My son who is very disciplined and
in great shape does the expert level daily and finds it good for his level as well. My wife's usage is in between.  All 3 of us enjoy it.",1194048000,5,646,4.128
