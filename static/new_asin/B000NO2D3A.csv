8179616,4,B000NO2D3A,"I have been a fan of Keli Roberts since her Cher Fitness workout video.  I have since ordered quite a few of her latest DVDs in recent years and have been satisfied with them all.  This is deinitely one of the better ones of my selection.  It's not super long but the moves are great and you really break into a sweat.  My thighs, buns and back were definitely sore the next day, which surprised me because I do alot of lower body exercises/weightlifting at the gym.  just goes to show you that you are working some different muscles that are normally not worked.",1200700800,17,563,4.375
8179617,4,B000NO2D3A,"Keli is such a good instructor.  I've said it before that she's one of my top 5 favourites.  She's very motivating, friendly, cues well and knows her stuff.  In this workout she combines unique movements with classic moves which is refreshing and fun.  For example there is your basic bridges and lunges to things like lateral lunges with a medicine ball bounce.  All muscles are worked in different ways and positions which gives you that good soreness the next day.  All you need is some weights and a medicine ball.  It's only about 40 minutes, but it's not to challenging and fun to do and afterwards, you will definately know you've worked out almost every conceivable muscle.  If you do this about three times a week, then you're going to look very buffed in no time at all.",1200528000,15,780,4.601449275362318
