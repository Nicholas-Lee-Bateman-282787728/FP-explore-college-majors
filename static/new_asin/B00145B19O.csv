8254474,3,B00145B19O,"This was a video documentary of Dr. Bernal's book ""Black Athena"" that suggested Ancient Greece may have been influenced by sub-Saharan Africa.  I just learned that Dr. Bernal died and this work may seem quite dated now.  The publication of ""Not Out of Africa"" may also have quelled the popularity of this book.  The work has an Afrocentric NYC community college professor who seems like he's crazy, but it also has a female Egyptian scholar who seemed borderline ethnocentric.  There are all kinds of documentaries that ask all kinds of questions:  did Greeks create Incan civilization?  was Marilyn Monroe murdered?  did the Chinese get to North America first?  etc.  It wouldn't hurt to ponder the subjects asked in this work, even two decades later.",1415404800,,752,5.0
