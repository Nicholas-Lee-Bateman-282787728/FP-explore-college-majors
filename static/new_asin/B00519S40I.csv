The plot was great and it was not one of your boring romantic movies.  She loved the music in this movie.  What more can I say.

4520778,5,B00519S40I,"I usually don't go for the Romantic / oooh I love you type movies. But
I must say, this movie by far exceeded all my expectations. Not only
did I watch the movie multiple times, I purchased it to add to my
collection. And my friends will tell you, if I buy it I must really
like it. there were not the regular slow spots that are in most movies
today. It was well thought out and put together VERY well. I would
recommend this movie to just about anyone and everyone. If you like to
laugh and get real value from your movies, then seriously consider this
one. This is one of those movies that if you do not pay attention to it, you will miss out on a great one. Make sure you check this out, you will NOT be sorry.",1313366400,,714,4.0
4520779,5,B00519S40I,"I typically am not a fan of romantic comedies. The story is always the same; girl meets boy, girl chases boy, girl and boy fall in love the end. This movie offers a twist to the traditional romantic comedies I have seen. I really enjoyed the directors approach in dealing with romances when it comes to the urban community. The movie kept my attention the entire time and I really felt connected to the characters. This movie will make you laugh, it's an all around feel good movie. I was shocked to see how great the quality of the movie was and the excellent cinematography used for an independent film. I actually liked it just as much, if not better, than some of the few urban romance comedies released such as: Brown Sugar, The Wood, Boomerang, etc. If you are looking for a great movie, one the entire family can enjoy, this is the movie to own!",1312416000,2,852,4.43312101910828
4520780,4,B00519S40I,"I watched this movie in the theaters about a year ago.  I am pretty impressed that it is moving on to DVD in major retailers.  As a fan of film, and especially independent film, I thought this movie was a very solid effort.  On the outside I was expecting it to be corny, but I was shocked at how funny it was a times.  Typically with indies, you get a movie that is all ""shock value"" or a movie that is over the top with comedy or religion or something.  It felt like this story was about a real person and the funny situations were something I could see myself going through.

Overall, it is a quality way to spend 90 minutes.  I am looking forward to what these guys put out next.",1312243200,,683,4.090225563909774
4520781,5,B00519S40I,"I hate when I watch a romantic comedy and I'm super bored and disappointed because the movie is not funny or corny. Most romantic comedies don't work because they tend to very generic and formulaic. The Anatomy of Love is not one of those disappointments.  The Anatomy of Love is a great romantic comedy because it is a simple story that appeals to both men and women. It's upbeat, it has plenty of laughs, and superior video quality.  The Anatomy of Love is a great independent film.",1311638400,5,484,4.551724137931035

They don't make movies like this anymore.... I suggest you donot hesistate and buy it now too. Or rent from Netflix, whatever. GREAT,FUNNY (and even touching) MOVIE!!",1323734400,,301,4.490909090909091
8452453,4,B00519S40I,"The Anatomy of Love is a PG-13 movie that addresses the potential and common issues of love that derive from divorce. Often children grow up with a definition of love that is derived from their home environment, and therefore their parents. The Anatomy of Love opens the dialogue between parents and children (teens) on the true meaning of love. Jenesis apprehension to love, Cassious decision to lay his heart on the line, and both their peers and parents reactions to love provokes audiences, young and mature, to reflect on the value and quality of their relationships. It causes each person to evaluate the message they are sending to their significant others, spouses, children and friends on love. This is a must see movie for anyone, who has ever been, will be, or currently is in love. A terrific date night movie!",1323302400,,822,4.836879432624113

Great set-up,with comedy, frustration,disappointment and a lovely twist at the end.  I was on the edge of my seat until the very end hoping for a happy ending. I would definitely recommend Anatomy of Love to anyone who likes a great romantic comedy.",1323129600,,347,4.672131147540983
8452455,5,B00519S40I,Genesis and Cassious take us on roller coaster ride of love.  The chemistry between the two of them makes you think of your own relationships.  I would highly recommend any one who is pursuing or in a relationship to see this film.,1322870400,,231,4.476190476190476

8452459,5,B00519S40I,"I first saw The Anatomy of Love at a premiere in the summer of 2010. This movie is great! The characters have the ability to draw you in and make you feel as if you really know them. The storyline was amazing, its definitely not predictable and at times had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. All in all, The Anatomy of Love was a superb film and I can't wait until I receive my DVD so I can watch it again and again!",1314921600,,449,3.891304347826087
