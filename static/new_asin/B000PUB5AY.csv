8259541,3,B000PUB5AY,"I watched this a few years ago, as part of a sci-fi multi-pack. Although the story does involve the inventor of a remote control airplane and his test, ""Robot Pilot"" is not sci-fi. My take was that it's a very lame rip-off on ""It Happened On Night,"" without the laughs, charm, charisma, or any of the entertainment value. The best thing about it was seeing a 60 year old example of a minor film company ripping off a successful film from a major studio. Some things never change.",1472774400,,479,4.454545454545454

8259544,2,B000PUB5AY,"Different internet sources call this movie, variously, an action thriller and a screwball comedy.  It is neither.  There is some mild humor and one character is meant to be comical.  However the main humor associated with this character is his long explanations in fractured English and a little Spanish.  The main characters do capture an enemy agent but it isn't very thrilling.  I noticed one scene in which the characters took off in one airplane but are shown flying a different plane.

I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1465862400,,563,4.8125

8259546,3,B000PUB5AY,"ROBOT PILOT (""Emergency Landing"") is a programmer directed by the prolific William Beaudine.

The picture stars 22-year-old Forrest Tucker (Sgt.

He and weather observer ""Doc"" Williams (Vogan) develop a remote control device to operate planes. Their initial trial for the military is sabotaged by foreign agents and the pilotless plane crashes. They determine to do more work on their robotic gadget, but we haven't seen the last of those blankety-blank spies!
