5652713,2,B00BMUL68C,The acting is horrible and the graphics are worse than bad.  I gave it two stars because Bali Rodriguez is so unbelievably beautiful running around in skin camo.,1370908800,4,161,4.75
5652714,1,B00BMUL68C,"This movie doesn't fall into the SyFy-esque category of laughably bad films suitable for evenings of group camraderie while consuming intoxicating substances. It falls into the realm of movies so poorly written, poorly acted, choppily edited, and confusing that even heavy imbibing will be insufficient to get you and your friends through it. And then there are the clumsy attempts of the actors to hit their marks and emote towards the camera, guaranteed to elicit groaning and objects hurled towards your TV. This film was possibly conceived as an experimental form of abuse for prisoners. I heartily recommend you stay away. If your friends like this movie, you need new friends.",1370649600,9,682,5.153153153153153
5652715,2,B00BMUL68C,"A fairly promising start rapidly degenerated into an amateurish, SyFy-esq, production. The sets are a tad corny, the CGI is a tad low budget, the acting is a tad starchy. It's not a bad movie, I've seen a lot worse but unless you like a ""made for TV feel"" to your movies you'll be a little disappointed. As I said, not a terrible movie but compared with the high quality effects we're used to now this seemed like an 80's TV movie. I've seen better acting & effects in Dr. Who.",1370390400,,477,4.252747252747253

5652717,3,B00BMUL68C,Adrian Paul is a standout in this story of a group of people stranded on what seems to be an alien planet; they try to survive the environment including attacks by shape changers that are hard to visualize.  Good twist at the end.,1370131200,2,230,4.348837209302325

5652719,1,B00BMUL68C,"This film was so bad, that i had to take the time to write my first review on Amazon Instant Video. the SCI-FI film was a huge disappointment and had special effects that was hard to disgust. This film was not worth the rental fee and i recommend even for the SCI-FI lover, no waste your time, you will get more enjoyment out of watch a 1950's SCI-FI movie in Black & White. The ships and crash site for the movie looked like a garbage dump and nothing like a ship. The storyline actually had potential if the acting and the low budget effects wasn't so bad.",1370044800,,558,4.224299065420561
5652720,4,B00BMUL68C,"Not perfect, but well done.  The CGI effects were better than I expected for a grade B sci fi movie.  Adrian Paul's acting was quite a bit better this time than some of his past efforts.  Richard Greico's acting skills were not taxed by any means in this movie. Chalk that up to directing and how his character was written, any fan of his knows he has done better. Interestingly one new actor (Bali Rodriguez) turned in a good performance (for a lovely lady whose main career is in modeling).  This movie is worth watching just to see her run around in camouflage. This movie was better than I expected, and is of better quality than much of the stuff running every week on the syfy channel.  I felt it was worth the money to rent this movie.",1370044800,27,742,4.3478260869565215
5652721,3,B00BMUL68C,"This is an Asylum film (not the one with Will Smith) which incorporates several other films or film pieces. There is a twist 10 minutes from the end which you figure out 10 minutes from the beginning, and I am going to great lengths (ugh!) not to reveal it Scooby-doo, although for most Sc-Fi fans if you know there is a twist, you know the twist. Sorry.

Earth is under attack by aliens. A large ship, the Albert Einstein (AE) manages to escape with a handful of people who go into cryo-sleep. The next thing we know they are on a pod, crash landing on a planet. This planet contains a race of invisible hunters called ""Chameleons."" There are locals and survivors from another space craft. Our group of hardy explorers are aided by Lea (Bali Rodriguez) because Pocahontas would be too obvious. There is also an android called TIM (Gray Hawks) who acts like he came from ""Next Generation."" Yes, ""There are some who call me... Tim.""

The goal of our group is to find a craft that didn't crash, get back to the mother ship in orbit and head on back to Earth...and kill as many Chameleons, giant CG bugs, and CG lizards as then can along the way.

The plot sounds great, but the acting and dialouge was dry. They created bad cardboard stereotypes when there was no need to do so. The film appears to be a TV pilot for a SyFy series. The execution misses the mark. Kids and SyFy movie fans might like it.

5652756,1,B00BMUL68C,"That says it all. That a company doesn't even bother to do this on a commercial release is just execrable. I'm willing to appreciate a B-movie as much as the next guy, but when a company doesn't even try to make it accessible, well.",1402185600,,232,4.295454545454546

5652760,4,B00BMUL68C,"I enjoyed the premise of the story. Survivors in cryo-sleep coming back to earth 325,000 years later after losing a war to aliens. It was interesting to see how things had changed and why. Even the human survivors on the planet and evolved over time. This has all the makings of a terrific television series with some similarities to the Terra Nova series. It loses a star because the CGI was weak.",1394928000,2,398,4.541666666666667
5652761,1,B00BMUL68C,"This is by far one of the worse movies I have ever seen. the acting was sub-par.  the plot was a joke. ( really fire arms that work 325,000 years in the future?) I would rather get a root canal then watch this again.",1394928000,,216,3.909090909090909
5652762,3,B00BMUL68C,"Standard fare, as a thinly veiled rip-off of Planet of the Apes, it delivers just what you would expect.  The filmmakers managed to make good use of the jungle environment.  The acting is decent; no one strained themselves in the effort.  The plot is generic; a group of survivors escape Earth as it is besieged by aliens.  While cryogenically frozen they crash on a planet and must adapt or die.  The ending is not a surprise.  There are very few CGI creatures that they must fight, nothing spectacular.  They also do battle with a race of beings called Chameleons, helping in this battle are some local natives.  Naturally, the cover art on the DVD case bears no resemblance to anything in the film (this includes the toothy creature depicted on the back cover as well).  This film is not nearly as exciting as it could have been but it does the job well enough for a minor sci-fi flick.
I'm keeping it to watch again.",1394928000,4,920,4.527272727272727
5652763,3,B00BMUL68C,If we keep sending messages into space this could be what we have in store for us. I liked the story line and how it developed to the result that earth had been destroyed and colonized. It was a little hard to believe that the fighter craft they found would have been functionally after many thousands of years.,1394928000,,311,4.379310344827586
5652764,5,B00BMUL68C,Fantastic story.  One of the best out of the Asylum movies.  The last fade back is the real shocker.  Enjoy.,1394409600,2,108,4.3
5652765,2,B00BMUL68C,"This is a low budget film with affordable actors, the script, directing, acting, casting and special effects are all made for TV quality. I rented the film because it starred Adrian Paul, I liked his work in the Highlander but the script, casting and directing of this film doesn't allow Mr. Paul to live up to his potential.
The Alien's in the film are invisible or just a visual distortion, I'm sure this was done to save money along with filming in outdoor remote areas to save on set building and using a recycled script.
The rental price could be lower for this movie but if you need your sci-fi fix or if you're an Adrian Paul fan it's watchable once but don't expect it to be great.",1390953600,,689,4.390625

5652771,1,B00BMUL68C,"This is the first time I've awarded a 1-start to a movie.  It is so bad that I had to stop watching it.  This movie seem like someone wanted to mix every popular science fiction concept into one movie and do it all with a terrible script, plot, and direction.
It starts off with the end of the world scene from the movie 2012.  They have a poor android like Data from Star Trek.  They land on a planet like Predator.  There was absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie.  They couldn't even get the special effects right.

I usually read reviews, and I didn't today because I ordered it on my TV. BIG MISTAKE.

Horrible graphics and even worse acting.
Like others said, a LOT of CG, but the worst part is that if they were already using CG, why use cardboard and aluminum sheet stages, (literally)???

Sorry, but it really sucked.",1383523200,7,362,4.640625

A beautiful movie because it was made in Costa Rica. Otherwise, not worth the rental cost I paid.  Not much of a story, not much of a twisty ending.

The beginning was so confusing I thought I had skipped the first 1/2 hour accidentally.  What was going on there?  I still don't know. And how they had time to do a lottery during an alien invasion... well it must have been a very quick lottery. The robot assistant TIM is just a copy of Data from ST:TNG in Costa Rica.

The story is not bad, and there is a twist ending. Though, you probably will figure out the ending before you actually get there.

I rented it, and it's a good adventure time waster if you like Scfi as I do. I would watch it again.",1377302400,2,457,4.181818181818182
5652808,4,B00BMUL68C,"Fairly engrossing film with an interesting premise.  Being a sci-fi afficiando my satisfaction is not that easily achieved since CGI, animatronics and other gizmos have advanced so far since the first Star Wars films that my tastes have become jaded overtime.  This is probably a better film for tweens and teens than for someone who has gone through the whole evolutionary cycle that sci-fi has taken over 70 years.",1377129600,,416,5.0144927536231885

5652811,4,B00BMUL68C,"AE is an obvious mockbuster of After Earth, but so thoroughly surpasses it that only the presence of Will Smith in the genuine article gives away the copy. That's not to say it's great- the effects are mediocre, anyone will see the twist ending coming from a mile away, and the middle lacks punch, but compared to the Asylum's usual fair, it's a well-shot, well-edited, totally passable film I would have no problem watching again.

These direct-to-video sci-fi films tend to follow a pretty predictable formula, so I'll break this review down into its constituent parts:

Lone Token Celebrity:
Adrian Paul. He used to be Duncan Macleud of Highlander: The Series fame, then he was a spokesman for lingerie companies for a while, and now he has to be content with banging supermodels and making cheapo sci fi movies whenever his Maserati needs a new timing belt. Poor guy.

Lesson About Man's Hubris:
None really. Fleeing earth for distant worlds after an alien invasion, the crews of several spaceships crash back ON Earth in the distant future where they must battle the descendants of the original invaders, survive the now-hostile jungle landscape that covers the planet, and score with the hot jungle-girl remnants of their own species. And they make a pretty good, selfless go of it; by the 90 minute mark our ragtag heroes have liberated humanity from alien slavery, ended racism, and shot down a space station. Even the requisite jackass naysayer character redeems himself in the end.

Carnage:
Surprisingly believable for an Asylum film. The alien attacks and monster fights are well realized and there's a panicked battle scene at the start that is very effective.

Awful Effects:
All the CG is decent, although like most Asylum films the best effects are there and gone again in the first 10 minutes. The invisible aliens are fairly decent, although having them ALWAYS be invisible makes it seem less like a plot point and more like a money saving device. We NEVER See the aliens made visible, unless that's one of them yelling at the movie title on the box there.

Romantic Subplot:
Adrian Paul meets a foxy lady in the jungle, and after spending about 3 days frolicking around the tropics they get it on in a lake. This is actually how he spends most of his winters, so it was pretty easy to make it seem natural.

Big Action Truck:
This is the future, so everyone has big action spaceships. The aliens have little gunboats they use to menace the heroes, but in the end Paul and company recover the Last Starfighter of the human fleet and much payback is had.

Predictable and slow, AE still manages to best that OTHER AE and become a genuinely acceptable action romp. If this is the direction Asylum films are going to continue taking, then the other (AA) studios may have to watch out.",1376265600,3,2799,4.768595041322314
5652812,2,B00BMUL68C,"This film needs a better writer, director, actors (except one), and props crew. The whole thing was probably filmed in a small studio & on one acre in the thicket in Hawai'i (they keep running back and forth in the same area?). I wasn't too impressed. My suggestion for the producers is to save more money and put ""that"" towards a better film... Should you see it? Remember ""Land of the Lost"" from the '70s? Watch that instead. This movie has an apocalyptic scenario - it's not a new planet, but Earth after an apocalypse 300 years in the future... then they head back to Earth? What are they caught up in a time loop?

I made the mistake of renting this straight-to-DVD 'movie' from one of those rental kiosks, and turned it off three or four times before deciding to force myself to watch the rest - it was really that bad. Like most Asylum productions, it's a third rate knock off of a Roland Emmerich story, with a few lifts from other movies just to stay the right side of copyright. What I've learned now is, if it's an Asylum scifi production, it'll be an embarassing high-school-esque attempt to 'me too' itself onto your screen.

5652842,4,B00BMUL68C,"This low-budget gem of a story made under the Asylum masthead is not to be dismissed by the snobbery of the bigger studios.  Set in the rigorous but breathtaking backdrop of the Costa Rican jungle, it is a fine example of what can be accomplished with less.  Some of the leading players are well-known, but it was also nice to see the use of some local talent.  This was a great vehicle for Adrian Paul, and it was fun to see his talent and very appreciable screen presence put to good use in this film.  Richard Grieco also had some great moments.  Newcomer Bali Rodriguez will be one to watch and her body makeup design was outstanding.  The special effects were more than decent.  The movie's score (by Chris Ridenhour) and it's panoramic cinematography lent a definite big-budget feel to the film.  For those of us who are die hard SciFi adventure fans, I would like to have seen the story fleshed out a bit more, as there was the opportunity to develop the very good story line into either a longer, more complex version, or to continue this story in an ongoing sequel.  It should be noted that this direct-to-video can be seen under the title ""Alpha Earth"" on Amazon Instant Video, or a DVD version alternately titled ""AE: Apocalypse Earth.""",1371772800,12,1247,4.581081081081081

5652845,5,B00BMUL68C,"A Thunder Levin flick.
Exciting beginning,Kind of STARSHIP TROOPERS.
Then the crew lands on a Alien Planet ? and goes into PREDATOR film territory.
We get a `Sci-Fi Channel' swim ( That means the scream queens tiny bikini AIN'T coming off) aka AVATAR.
The title is similar to a 10 year old CG flick TITAN A.E..
It has two of our favorite B-Movie tough Guys ADRIAN PAUL (Highlander) and RICHARD GRIECO (21 Jumpstreet).
The spaceships are really nice,The aliens are BAD (Predator mode) and GOOD (THE MOLE PEOPLE) and the ending was a Great Payoff.",1371081600,,545,4.747368421052632

8571053,3,B00BMUL68C,"I honestly don't think AE intended to be ""ground breaking"" sci fi.  As many others have mentioned before, they took elements that they liked from other Sci Fi classics, from ""Predator"" to ""Avatar"" to ""Planet of the Apes"", but once you accept that this is nothing new, it really isn't bad to watch and is a fun way to spend an hour and a half.  Would I pay money to see this?  Probably not, but as a Netflix type movie it was fun to watch and eat some popcorn to.

They never tell you where the aliens come from, but it's somewhat moot as the story picks up with massive city bombardment and ""arks"" fleeing Earth to who knows where.  Not sure why each Ark was going somewhere different, since to rebuild a population you need a sizable amount of people, but the story really picks up when they awaken from cryo-sleep to find themselves crashed on a planet where the humans are kept in pens.  Along with their sexy camouflaged native gal, and later the help from the pale white people of this world, they rebel against the ""Predator"" like aliens in a classic ""nature vs. technology"" (ala ""Avatar"").  When they do manage to salvage a ship (the fact that the power cell should have lasted a 1000 years and was ""dead"" was a clear indicator a lot more time had passed than we knew) and escape this world, the ""ST:TNG Data clone"" buddy of theirs tells them they still are on Earth, it's just 325k years in the future (relativity's a b*tch).  Since they were good enough not to copy ""Planet of the Apes"" as much as to show a half buried Statue of Liberty, they instead landed on top of what was left of Mount Rushmore, and I actually give them kudos for picking something that's not only recognizable, but would still be there 325k in the future (barring disasters), and they even made the mountain shorter, which it would be that far in the future.  Not sure if blowing up our moon would have formed the pretty rings in 325k years or not, but I'm sure someone with actual knowledge of astrophysics could explain that one better.

But still, all in all, I'll give it 3 stars (rounding up the 2.5 I'd really have liked to give it).",1437177600,,2122,4.39030612244898

8571057,3,B00BMUL68C,"""TITAN A.E."" meets ""PLANET OF THE APES"" meets ""PREDATOR"" in what was intended to be a ""knockbuster"" of that ""Let's Give Will Smith's Talentless Spawn A Job And Force Him Down Everybody's Throat"" claptrap vehicle that failed to trap even a single clap, ""AFTER EARTH.""

Expecting it to be just another nugget in The Asylum's mountain of ""fool's gold"" that was only worthy of a quick look for little purpose other than to witness how much (and how badly) they'd ripped-off from the mainstream gold mine that they were unapologetically  mimicking, the trailer for this movie was actually enough to pique my genuine curiosity. And upon viewing this movie in its entirety, I actually found what I consider akin to an unrefined and unpolished semi-precious gem. Only one other movie from The Asylum's vault of horrors has been impressive enough to received such generous consideration* from me: ""H.G. Wells' WAR OF THE WORLDS,"" which of course was released to coincide with that Tom Cruise hyper-budgeted loud & obnoxious disappointment, but which also (as an added plus in its favor) presented a version of the story that was significantly more faithful to the source material (ignoring the substitution of ""quadropedal"" crab-like machines for the classic towering ""tripedal"" variety). -- [*Update: we can now add the ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" knock-off, ""ABRAHAM LINCOLN vs. ZOMBIES,"" to that semi-impressive list.] So this was just further confirmation that The Asylum CAN indeed produce ""quality merchandise"" if only they'd take the subject matter more seriously (and of course, if they'd sufficiently ""back"" such projects budgetarily).

Yes, consistent with the long string of other Direct to Digital Media fare released under the ""Asylum"" banner, their CGI rendering & blending processes are noticeably lacking any top-notch refinement before incorporating the ""finished"" product into the final cut so that it still has that amateurish look & feel that they are so customarily known for. But if any of you are at all familiar with The Asylum's F/X offerings in general, then you must concede that the CGI effects as presented in this movie are practically ""high art"" by The Asylum's notoriously low standards. For once, I was actually able to watch an ""Asylum"" CGI-incorporated presentation and not feel my attention being uncomfortably distracted away from the movie because of the blatant clashing of onscreen imagery. The Asylum needs to begin showing this same level of commitment to making CG-incorporation into their product feel more ""natural"" and less ""cartoony"" -- and for a company that has not lost money on their movie releases, they should seriously consider bumping up the budgets of what they are willing to allow for new and ambitious projects.

Downsides? Of course, I'm certain that EVERYBODY was (or will be) annoyed with the ST:TNG ""Lt. Data"" knock-off. And though I liked the ""cloaked"" adversary of the movie, even though we never actually got to see what they looked like without it (which was a little bit of a letdown), the fact that they provided an anticipated representation of the creatures on their promotional packaging (in the manner of the overcast ""Eye of Doom"" from the ""LIFEFORCE"" promotional images) ultimately made that aspect of the movie feel like a ""bait-&-switch"" and leaves us feeling somewhat unfulfilled, whereas had they not ""hyped"" our expectations like that we would've felt less slighted, if we even felt slighted at all. Then finally, of course, just because we all know that Clark Kent is really Superman, we should not be expected to hold his contemporaries to the same standard... so ""suspension of disbelief"" is in order when watching this one, even though it's still a giant stretch to believe that the characters in the movie could not have easily figured out what was going on less than 10 minutes into the film, but again, just go with it and spare yourself the stress & angst.

Overall, considering that this movie was budgeted for less than $1/2 million, though I'm sure more could've been done even with that minimal budget if they'd employed some creative ""thinking outside of the box,"" what we eventually got was something that showed that The Asylum has the potential to provide reasonably solid entertainment with that ever-desirable independent ""alternative cinema"" flavor to it. But if ""knockbusters"" are going to continue to be their forte, then I'd hope that they'd do so with ""quality"" in mind, so as to give audiences a real reason for wanting to watch their knock-offs to see their reinterpretive treatment of the products they decide to leech off of, as opposed to continuing to produce headshaking facepalming krap whose sole seeming purpose is to be mocked and derided.",1420675200,2,4750,5.115979381443299
