3905475,5,B002CA68HK,"This movie tells the story of how Canada's citizens beat back the right wing to bring about universal healthcare, which is now supported by 80% of Canadians.",1300406400,,157,4.851851851851852
3905476,5,B002CA68HK,"The heated debate in the U.S. about health care reform made me wonder if universal health care passed by a large consensus in Canada, or if there was a great struggle or opposition.  Prairie Giant explains the history of Medicare in Canada by depicting the life of young Tommy Douglas and his wonderful wife Irma Dempsey.

Douglas started off as a minister until he realized that he could never heal people's wounds when they were caused by exploitative conditions at work.  He was a maverick, bravely advocating on behalf of unions and other social issues before he took on Medicare; he had to leave the church in order to do so and go into politics, becoming the extremely popular premier of Saskatchewan.

Often I feel disheartened about our current politicians.  They talk a good talk but when they get into office, they do and say something entirely different.  It was very illuminating and inspiring to watch Douglas, perhaps one of the greatest Canadians in the last century.  He was a man of decency and integrity -- even his ornery nature in later years and resistance against spending the rest of his life federalizing Medicare only served to humanize him.  And his wife was his equal partner and driving force.  Great story.  Highly recommended.

3905477,3,B002CA68HK,"I became aware of Tommy Douglas recently and thought the story sounded like one relevant to our times.  While looking for books on the subject I found out about the movie.  You have to love Amazon!  On further research I decided that the purchase would be worth while so I did.
Right out of the box I noticed that the copy I received did not have the same cover art as depicted on Amazon. As easily I noted that the back of the box mentioned bonus features that weren't evident on the dvd once I got it to play.  Of the four DVD players around the house this dvd only played on one.  Once I did get it to play, there were strange gaps in the sound track.  Evidently the copy I received has been ""family edited"" for our child-like appreciation. After many calls and emails I was finally contacted by the firm Bridgestone Multimedia Group who I requested an adult version from.  They don't have one and when asked about the missing bonus material they sent me a cc of a request to someone that they investigate the missing material.  I have never heard back.  In fairness, they did offer me a full refund, then a partial refund and keep the movie which I decided to accept.  After all I bought it because I wanted it!

Then I decided to buy another copy.  This time I purchased the ""2 disc collector's edition"" from another vendor and which I review there.  To recap, here are the negatives about this copy and rendered in light of the purchase of a comparative product.  1. Censored, very clumsily, for language, there is no skin to fear here. 2. Menus consist of ""Chapter 1"", ""Chapter 2"", etc...with no picture or caption to tell you what point of the film you might be looking at. 3. Bonus materials completely absent from the disc but printed on the cover. 4. Does not play on all machines (problems varied from sound track to chapter skip to speed, all on which the replacement copy performed just fine as do my other dvds) 5. The delivered cover art is an obvious rip off of the Grant Wood painting ""American Gothic"" but that IS really nit pickin'. The positive? See the reviews for the collector's edition.  The only reason this copy got 3 stars is the power of the film alone but this review deals with the published product and this would be adequate for viewing in any home at any age if your equipment will accept it.  Spoiler alert! There really isn't that much ""dirty"" language in the movie, Tommy Douglas was, after all, a Baptist minister! A colloquialism for urination comes to mind but if you grew up on a farm you are way beyond being shocked at that! Buy the other version and enjoy the experience.",1265328000,8,2615,4.427974947807933

3905479,5,B002CA68HK,"I saw this when it was a made for TV movie for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. It's the story of a Baptist minister in the prairie during the Great Depression who sees the needs of his people and starts organizing ways to help. An incident involving striking miners politicizes him which displeases the church. He is forced to choose between what they saw as being too political and his activities as minister. It's a moving story that even kept my 12 year old glued to it which really amazed me. I thought a kid would find the story-line boring. It's the story of Tommy Douglas' adult life until his death, and how he fought so that all Canadians could have health insurance and many other benefits. It's an inspiration and certainly timely as the US debates something as fundamental as health care for all. (BTW Tommy Douglas' mother died because she didn't have insurance and that helped fuel his fight).",1254182400,,907,4.675

8363738,5,B002CA68HK,This is for those who are willing to look at all sides of an issue. It's thought provoking and helps one see the flaws in our perception of reality. Not for people who don't want to learn.,1408320000,,188,4.108108108108108
8363739,4,B002CA68HK,"As an American, I know very little about Canadian history and heroes, so this film was a learning experience for me.  The story is certainly heartwarming, showcasing one man's heroic efforts to minister to the downtrodden and level the playing field for the benefit of Depression Era farmers, miners and laborers, and continuing into mid-Century Canadian politics.  It's a well-crafted film, and I was thoroughly impressed.

I had seen the entire story on-line and decided I wanted to have in in my collection for the benefit of my children and grandchildren.  Language was at times forceful, but not particularly vulgar or offensive, and I was disappointed that some words were cut out of the DVD.",1399852800,,698,5.043478260869565

8363741,5,B002CA68HK,"This is a powerful, moving story about one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century. I highly recommend people watch this film to learn something about a Canadian pastor who was influenced by the social gospel movement and went on to create Medicare, the Canadian health care system that is so popular that no politician dares to try to dismantle it.",1387065600,,353,4.709677419354839
8363742,5,B002CA68HK,"The historical capture of Pastor Tommy Douglas's story takes one on a journey through vital & important steps forward in achieving access to healthcare for Canadians.  From Pastor Tommy Douglas to Premier Tommy Douglas one views the actualization of this extraordinary man's unwavering vision of achieving tremendous advances for a Nation.  This story and its production is simply breathtaking.  The sweet and heroic depiction through vignettes of timeline is legendary.

I enjoyed learning about actress Shirley Douglas's life through the historic journey of her father, Premier Tommy Douglas who also happens to be the grandfather of actor Kiefer Sutherland (Shirley's son).

8363744,5,B002CA68HK,"The acting is sometimes wooden and the editing of the film occasionally uneven, but even with those shortcomings the story is compelling.  This movie is for anyone interested in three controversial topics, national health care, manufactured government budget crises and faith in politics.  It illustrates that all politics are personal, both in execution and impact.  After watching the film, I understand why Tommy Douglas was voted the most influential figure in Canada's history.",1314230400,,482,5.575342465753424
