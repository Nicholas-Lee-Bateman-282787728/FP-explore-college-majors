Also wish PBS or some TV channel would still air his programs on a regular if only one time weekly.
So may children not just our son would have their life enhanced.",1437523200,,299,4.418181818181818
8426055,3,B004DTS0YW,"We bought this for our 4-year-old, and he loves it. I would give the program itself 5 stars. However, there's only one 30-minute episode on the disk. Mister Rogers would never have approved of such wastefulness. Also, the video is a little jerky at times; it appears to be a digital glitch, not an artifact in the original recording. This is what happens when marketers are allowed to make decisions artists and engineers should be making. I hope someday the entire Mister Rogers series is given the video treatment it deserves.",1327017600,4,528,4.813186813186813
