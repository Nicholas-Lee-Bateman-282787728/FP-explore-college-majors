Without any doubt the best production we have ever seen of Giselle. Of course it would be wonderful to be there, but in some ways
the DVD is even better. Close-ups and different views  Sure you lose the atmosphere but this DVD on our Bose system
was fantastic.  Well worth the cost and we will be watching again ------soon!

8469842,5,B005FAH1BG,"Everybody has a favorite Giselle. Or two or three. There might not be a bad performance in Amazon's catalog. The seven I've seen are all good, more or less. Among my favorites are two on Blu-ray -- Alina Cojocaru and the Royal Ballet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giselle-Blu-ray/dp/B001U5V04Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giselle [Blu-ray</a>] and the Dutch National Ballet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-Giselle-Blu-ray/dp/B002VR9QXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam: Giselle [Blu-ray</a>] with its beautifully filmed Act II.

Along with those, this DVD reissue of La Scala's 2005 production, which features the pairing of Svetlana Zakharova and Roberto Bolle and an all-around solid performance, merits the notice of ballet lovers who already have another Giselle they hold near and dear.

With Zakharova's regal bearing and phenomenal extensions, you might not think she could convincingly portray the naive country girl of Act I. Such low expectations fail to credit Zakharova's intelligence and skills as an actress. Her realization of the simple, carefree young woman who unexpectedly encounters love is so completely natural, so unforced, that if you'd never seen Zakharova before, you'd have a hard time picturing her in another role.

And when she discovers how Albrecht has betrayed her, literally lets down her long flowing hair and goes mad -- my goodness, Zakharova raises the intensity level to an entirely higher plane. The look of wildness on her face, of sheer terror, of being suddenly thrown into a world where nothing any longer makes sense is matched by the sweep of her dynamic movement about the stage that so rivets our attention that when she collapses in death, we don't even notice the camera has missed the exit of Albrecht's betrothed and her royal retinue.

This is one hell of a performance.

But the ballet's only half over, and Zakharova is by no means finished. In Act II, as a wholly spiritual Giselle no longer limited by the weakness of her physical heart, Zakharova is free to display her fuller abilities as a dancer and as an actress, which are formidable. Marta Romagna is a stern-faced, implacable Myrtha, but Zakharova's Giselle stands before her, unrelenting, indomitable. When dawn finally breaks and Myrtha and the Wilis must retreat, the feeling that a valiant victory has been won is palpable.

Bolle is no mere spectator here. In fact, it is the combination of the two dancers that places this Giselle among the very best.

Albrecht can be depicted as a rake, a scoundrel, a duplicitous Don Giovanni who seduces the innocent Giselle without care for the consequences. That's not Bolle's way. His characterization of the ing&eacute;nue's heartthrob is of an Albrecht who is naive in his own way -- a thoughtless man rather than a malicious one, a man who does not realize he is playing with the life of another human being until it is too late and she is dead.

When he enters in Act II, approaching Giselle's grave, Bolle's Albrecht is obviously contrite, conscious of his guilt, seeking forgiveness. And Myrtha makes him suffer -- oh, yes she does. Bolle is clearly a well-conditioned athlete, but by the time he has collapsed in parallel to Giselle's demise in Act I, he is panting and dripping with sweat. In its own way, Bolle's performance in Act II is no less phenomenal than Zakharova's, and it is the pair of them together that make this Giselle so strong. When Zakharova/Giselle sinks back into her grave (which is accomplished so deftly in this production), a real sense of atonement emanates from Bolle/Albrecht -- a sense that not all Giselle stagings convey.

In addition to the outstanding lead roles, La Scala's corps de ballet performs here as superbly as it did in Swan Lake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Swan-Lake-Zakharova-Bolle-Sutera-Chisleni-Brazzo-Vallone-Tuggle-La-Scala-Ballet/dp/B000AMMSQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake / Zakharova, Bolle, Sutera, Chisleni, Brazzo, Vallone, Tuggle, La Scala Ballet</a>, which is no small compliment. Vittorio D'Amato makes Hilarion a decent, ordinary guy instead of the dumb country bumpkin too often represented. For once, Albrecht's royal fianc&eacute;e (Flavia Vallone) doesn't look old enough to be his mother. David Coleman's conducting is right on the mark, especially in the ""&Eacute;vocation magique"" scene of the Wilis. Video and audio quality are both top-notch.

Add all these elements together, and you have a Giselle that's well worth considering, no matter what your special favorite is. If you're new to Giselle -- or if it's new to you -- then this La Scala production makes for an excellent introduction.",1411776000,5,4800,5.581043956043956
8469843,5,B005FAH1BG,Every Ballet should have this. Its the most superb recording of this staple romantic tale. the principals are superb! A must have for any collection.,1411689600,3,149,5.0
8469844,5,B005FAH1BG,"Certainly, Adams Gisele is one of the most popular, beautiful and satisfying ballet in terms of story, music and dance. This performance, recorded at the Teatro Alla Scala  Milan, Italy , is perfect and deserves a top rating. The dancers, Svetlana Zakharova and Robert Bolle are incomparable, a show of skill and beauty Magical!
I enthusiastically recommend the DVD, if you love dance and want to enjoy a modern version of this work, hailed by ballet historians as the apotheosis of the Romantic Ballet.",1370822400,6,503,4.988095238095238
8469845,4,B005FAH1BG,"Giselle, with music by Adolphe Adam, is perhaps my favorite ballet, exquisite in terms of emotional depth and aesthetic beauty. Svetlana Zakharova is the star of this La Scala production, practically saving the entire production. The majority of the corps de ballet of La Scala are bland and unexciting, and at times fall out of their lines. The modified choreography doesn't do La Scala much justice, either.

What makes this definitely worth viewing and owning is Svetlana Zakharova's stunning performance as Giselle. Her perfect technique and beautiful lines aside, she portrays a near-ideal Giselle. This DVD is worth owning solely due to her. Opposite her is Roberto Bolle, who does a mediocre job at the emotionally intricate role of Albrecht. Though his body and frame are aesthetically ideal, he dances the role as a stereotypical romantic, without incorporating the genius of the story. Another dancer worth mentioning is Vittorio D'Amato, who I think was more or less the only native Italian worth mentioning (in terms of artistry), in the role of Hilarion.

The quality of the video is very good, with dozens of appropriately-placed shots throughout the ballet. For a more perfected version of Giselle, I would look to the Kirov's Giselle with Mezentseva. However, for fans of Zakharova and Giselle, this is worth owning.",1322179200,17,1332,5.190697674418605
