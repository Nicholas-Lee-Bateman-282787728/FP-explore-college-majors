8498855,5,B005ZPYG3M,"As everyone knows, Hostel was a great movie.
The original film is a horror movie about hormone-driven college students venturing in Europe.
I think Part II was even better. It describes the mechanics of how the enterprise works. I live on a ranch. The rancher sets up cameras with motion sensors to photograph the deer on his property. He then puts these photos on the internet, and people bid for the opportunity to kill these animals. When I said, ""It's just like 'Hostel'!"" he did not appreciate the comparison!
I'm writing this review to warn people. Part III is a poor quality knockoff. Don't pay extra for it.",1523059200,,615,4.703703703703703
