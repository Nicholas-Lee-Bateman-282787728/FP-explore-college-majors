1642908,5,B00005Q2Z1,"This movie is a must have if you enjoyed the Ah! My Goddess OVA series and more so if you are amoung the many who felt that the story could've benefited from more than five episodes.  The movie remains true to the OVA although there are some animation difference.  For example, the coloring done on Belldandy's facial features are slightly different.  I would hightly recommend that one watch the OVA series before the movie although it not a necessity.  I say it because it helps to get an understanding of the characters as there is very little in the way of introduction to the three goddesses in the movie.  The plot of the movie is very intriguing and is very good example of the good anime that is out there if you are willing to search for it.  The soundtrack is incredible especially the song which the three goddesses sing at the end.",1003968000,4,843,4.477124183006536
1642909,5,B00005Q2Z1,"OUTSTANDING!!
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY! WELL GREAT ANYWAY. I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN A POOR COPY OF THIS MOVIE A WHILE BACK AND I WAS STUNNED TO WATCH A NEW EP. THE STORY LINE IS SO FAR THE BEST IN THE SERIES YET.
IF YOUR NEW TO THIS SERIES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GETTING THE FIRST FIVE OAV'S FIRST. ""THE MOVIE WILL MAKE MORE SENSE"".
I CANT WAIT TO GET MY PAW'S ON IT.",1003795200,,359,3.8
1642910,5,B00005Q2Z1,"Very colorful and carefully drawn characters. You may have seen OAV series (AnimEigo) or Adventure of Mini Goddesses TV series (Pioneer).  This movie is very different and less humour. It's possibly great for mature audience.
The storyline is not Hollywood-quality if you know what I mean. It's very unpredictable and emotional.  It's something you would sit back at end of the movie saying, ""Gosh. Wait, let me play that movie again!""
Hope, it's helpful to you!",1000425600,4,462,5.065789473684211
1642941,5,B00005Q2Z1,This was a gently used movie with the original sleeve. The condition is as described.

Keiichi and Belldandy's sisters try everything to get her memory back and return their life to normal. However, they must pass a test no pair of lovers in history has ever been able to clear and remain together.

This movie is everything you've come to expect from the Ah My Goddess franchise and more. The animation is better and the story is more emotional and serious. It has a very touching ending. This is a must see for any anime fan.",1350432000,,616,4.4035087719298245

1642974,5,B00005Q2Z1,you can't beat the art work in this movie. the colors and style are very well done. the music is also very well done i really liked the climatic scenes song. the only problem is you need to have some background information on the main characters or the story seems like a book where you don't have the first 100 pages. i suggest either read the manga or watch the anime series before watching the movie to have that background information.,1294963200,,439,4.432098765432099
1642975,5,B00005Q2Z1,"This is one of my favorite anime of all time. The story is intriguing, the characters are interesting, the animation is fantastic, and I absolutely love the religious theme of both the characters and the story. The soundtrack is amazing! This is certainly anime at its finest. Highly recommended!",1275609600,,296,5.061224489795919
1642976,4,B00005Q2Z1,"Where as alot of anime movies are connected to a TV series, Ah My Goddess is signifigant as it was a direct sequal to the original OVA series from the 90s, which in America was called Oh My Goddess. Although the film included a few elements from the manga as well, this actually came out a few years before the TV remake.

Set around sometime after the end of the 5-episode OVA, Keichi is still living with the goddess Belldandy, and her sisters Urd and Skuld. Belldandy is visited by her old teacher Celestin, who was unknown to her imprisioned on the moon for rebelling against the gods when she was young. Celestin was released by the fairy princess Morgan Le Fay(from the Arthurian legend)to try and gain access to the Yggdrasil system that Heaven uses to control Earth. Celestin infects Belldandy with a virus that makes her forget everything that happened to her from when she first came to Earth and met Keichi. Urd and Skuld try using a vaccine to cure her and give back her memories, but this causes the Yggdrasil system to crash, and Celestin takes over Keichi's body. With Morgan, Celestin nearly succeeds, but Belldandy regains her memories and frees Keichi of his control. The three goddesses then bring their powers together to heal Yggdrasil, and set everything right again.

This film was very well executed. It had a solid story, a decent plot, and unlike alot of anime movies that spinoff from a series, it actually tied into the original in an exceptional way. It was directed by Hiroaki Godha, who went on to do the Ah My Goddess TV series which retold most of the story from OVA. You can enjoy this movie even if you're only briefly familar with the characters. Weirdly enough, you can see this as sequal to both the TV and OVA series. The astounding digital animation that was used(for in 2000)is still remarkable by today's standards. Even though there's a little less of the comedic factor that usually follows an AMG title, its a very entertaining shojo comedy.",1259107200,,1986,4.671428571428572
1642977,3,B00005Q2Z1,"I'm not a die-hard fan of Ah! My Goddess or anything, but sometimes when I'm tired or been having a hard day at work, the simple, happy characters and stories provide a welcome lull for more serious or thoughtful entertainment. I usually put something like this on or read Anne of Green Gables, or something like that.

This movie pretty much falls in that category. I was playing Aion and they had Verdandi, Urd, and Skuld in the starting zone for the Asmodeans and it reminded me of Ah! My Goddess; I ended up on Wikipedia, which finally ended with me buying the movie in a fit of boredom since I watched it a long time ago and didn't really remember it at all.

After I watched it again, I realized why I didn't remember anything. Nothing really happens, no interesting insight into anyone's character, no character development, and the plot is vague at best. It's not a translation issue either, since I speak fluent Japanese, and there just really wasn't anything going in dialogue or action-wise. If you're looking to learn more about the goddess universe or backstory for any of characters, do NOT buy this movie. If you're new to the franchise, I recommend the manga and/or the OAVs. Never watched the TV series, they could be decent, dunno.

I guess this movie is really an excuse for bad 3D and high quality representations of the beloved characters. I give it 3 stars because it made a great background movie and was pretty (and I have a soft spot for this series, what can I say) but it really probably deserves 2 stars.",1256169600,,1532,4.5636363636363635
1642978,5,B00005Q2Z1,"WOW! just wow, this movie is great. very well done and the anime is amazing as well. you can connect with the characters very quickly and the story is touching. im normally the type of guy that tray's not to get to emotional through movies but this is such a great film that i couldn't help but feel a tear form every now and then.=P there isn't much action on this tho...well except 4 the ending but once you start watching this trust me...you won't mind a bit. this is a great film to get for your psp. the movie also comes with a short full clip of there first eps of there anime series ""mini goddesses"" its such a great film they made a series for it. if the film couldn't put a smile on your face then the series well i promise. a must see!!",1189641600,3,746,4.081632653061225
1642979,5,B00005Q2Z1,"The movie and all that stuff is great, like everyone here would agree.

My only thoughts is that the packaging is a bit cheap feeling. The cover art on my DVD doesn't cover the whole case, so it looks kind of bad. No biggie, though.",1185926400,,232,4.155555555555556
1642980,5,B00005Q2Z1,this had action adventure and romance have to see it tell you some it would ruin the movie,1182816000,,90,4.055555555555555
1643001,5,B00005Q2Z1,"It's a super fun chick flick from the anime world... love it!  There was the standard AMG cast of characters and a little bit of suspense and drama.  The  animation was better than the series.  I personally think this is a movie my action-anime friends might actually watch (they're not normally into the romantic comedy stuff but this has plenty of both.)

You'll probably want to have a fundamental understanding of the Ah! My Goddess series before jumping into the movie though.  :)",1179100800,,485,4.783132530120482
1643002,5,B00005Q2Z1,"Most of the time, all the interesting animes end on a sour note.  Not Ah My Goddess.  It actually rewards fans of the series with a sweet, touching movie.

1643004,5,B00005Q2Z1,"Boasting of breathtaking visuals and an incredible level of detail, Ah! My Goddess: The Movie is the answer to every true-blooded Ah! My Goddess fan's prayer.

Life has been smooth sailing for lovebirds Keiichi and Belldandy, but here they are confronted with their greatest trial yet. A few new characters are introduced -- the main antagonist Celestin, who used to be Bel's teacher; Morgan, a butterfly-like girl who's bent on helping Celestin achieve his goals; and Peorth, a first-class goddess who seems to have a lot of control up in heaven. The main conflict arises within Belldandy, as she is torn between her beloved teacher and her human lover.

Ah! My Goddess: The Movie takes on a more serious tone, and the few comical moments it has are restricted to the first part. It also gives us a glimpse of Bel's childhood... subsequently revealing what had caused the present situation. Audiences will also be treated to a more in-depth look at the goddesses' home -- heaven. Ah! My Goddess's depiction of heaven is rather interesting. It takes your idea of heaven (clouds, majestic palaces, and all) and merges it with cutting-edge technology. They use complex computer systems to run things, and become helpless when Celestin plants a virus that takes the network down. The goddesses also get to show off their great powers in spectacular fight scenes, proving that they are more than just pretty faces.

The art and animation are magnificently done. I thought the OAV series looked exquisite, but this movie takes the cake. The characters look even more refined (which I didn't think was possible), and they move about as fluidly as running water. In addition, the backgrounds are rendered via an excellent combination of cels and computers. Spanning almost two hours, Ah! My Goddess: The Movie will assault your senses and stir your emotions. A must-see and a must-have for fans of the series, as well as a superior piece of work in its own right.",1158796800,2,1956,4.921212121212121
1643005,5,B00005Q2Z1,"I have read the mangas, and I found this movie to go along with them perfectly.  The animation is excellent, and the voice acting is, while not majestic, quite good.  The music score is perfect--it can almost make you cry at some points, and during the battles, it is heart pounding.  Not suprising, though, since it was Nobuo Uematsu(music director for all Final Fantasy games) who composed it.  The songs with lyrics were truly beautiful and actually put my heart at ease--an accomplishment in my books.

  The character design is flawless, and the movie in general is quite fluid and attention-grabbing, both emotionally and physically.  Compared to most other modernized anime, this is really worthy of praise.  It stands out among other anime of recent times, and I highly recommend it to any other true fans of anime, both past and present.

  Fujishima truly outdid himself in the creation of the characters within this movie.  They grab you in a bearhug and don't let go.  I found myself loving them as family in the manga, but I ended up in love after watching this movie.

  For those who've never really gotten into anime, I would suppose this is a good start.  But I, a die hard collector, have compared it to anime dating back to late 80's, and while it isn't up there with Akira or Evangelion, I regard it as one of the best.  For this reason, I give it five stars, and I already treasure it within my vast collection.",1154044800,2,1432,4.611111111111111
1643006,5,B00005Q2Z1,"Most important things about this theater version of Ah! My Goddess looks already covered by other fans. Although TV series version was actually produced after this movie version, this episode is most likely to be the last episode of all Goddess series in terms of time sequence, because the time frame of the episode is 2 years after Belldandy and Keiichi first met. They first met when Keiichi was a sophomore and now he is a senior. I am personally wondering to death what kind of life will likely to be after keiichi graduates the college.... But anyway, one thing I want to add for review is that Belldandy is now a bit possessive than before. In other episodes, she was nice to everybody, not just to keiichi, and did not show any jealous behavior, even when another girl hookks up Keiichi. She is quite different here. When Hasegawa got drunken and made fun of Keiichi with her breasts, Belldandy unconscientiously used her power to stop them. When Celestin, Belldandy's most trusted mentor, erased her all memory with Keiichi, she returned back to the nice-to-everyone mode. Although she is still extremely nice to keiichi despite the memory loss, her indifferent niceness sheds the sad gloom on entire movie until she finally gets aware of her ""one ugliness.""  Belldandy called her emotion toward to keiichi ugly, because she wants Keiichi just for herself and to share with no one, despite the fact that she, as a goddess, has to equally love and share everybody and everything. Well... I think she showed the possible limit of being innocent. At this level, innocence is almost a disease...  Anyway, if you are familiar with Ah My Goddess series, this movie version is like a perfumy drop of essence extracted from all Goddess series. I can't forget to mention the music. Actually, I listened to the OST music before I watched the DVD. I was first quite doubtful how such grandiose full-symphony music can fit in with Goddess stories. My experience later for DVD was... just ""Wow."" I regretted to death that I don't have 5+1 channel audio and 50-inch monitor. Somebody below mentioned about the English dubs. Yes, original Japanese voice certainly carries something that English version cannot offer. But they are not too bad after all, especially when you compare it with OVA version English dubs. In OVA version of Oh My Goddess (NOT Ah My Goddess), English dubs almost ruined the delicacy and finesse of the original film by unforgivably putting things in joke-like manner. I don't know who must to be blamed, translator, producer, voice crews, or even cultural difference, but clearly, the OVA version dubbing lacks appreciation. Fortunately, this DVD of Ah My Goddess is far better than the oVA version in terms of English dubs. But, the best is surely the original sounds. I never thought that Japanese language can this be enchanting.",1149292800,6,2851,4.8884297520661155
1643007,4,B00005Q2Z1,"I had purchased this movie without any worthwhile familiarity with Ah My Goddess in general, so I took a gamble in buying it (especially as I got it on VHS and ended with a DVD player for Christmas). However, it was worth the risk because the movie is wonderfully entertaining, has a deep, moving story, wonderful animation, and two of the new characters introduced are my favorites. There is also a lovely soundtrack, which I also recommend buying.

As a warning, this review may contain spoilers.

While knowing the basic premise of Ah My Goddess and knowing about a few important events in the series (manga at the point this moview was made), it's necessary to appreciate this movie. At this point, Belldandy and Keiichi have been living together in a restored temple for about 3 years, and all seems to be going swell. Urd and Skuld are still around, and life at Nekomi Tech is as usual. The motor club even has a new female member, Morgan. Yet one evening, Belldandy's mentor and teacher, the god Celestin, appears after having vanished for years. Yet during the encounter, Celestin erases Belldandy's memories of being with Keiichi. So sets events in motion of the movie.

While there is still comedy and romance, staples in Ah My Goddess, there is also action and drama. Soon Earth itself will be in grave danger, and even Yggdrasil may not be able to save it.

Other previously manga-only characters make their first animated appearances, including Peorth and Banpei. Yet my favorite characters are Celestin and Morgan. Celestin is a determined individual, bent on achieving his goals for what he believes is a greater good. Morgan is a woman who has been scorned by life and believes that some good will come of what Celestin does. Belldandy and Keiichi are simply pawns for a much larger event.

While normally I get rather bored with sappy romance, that doesn't bulk up the movie. If you ARE a fan of sappy romance, then this movie is good for you. This movie, in the end, doesn't result in large character development. We see new sides to all the characters, see how they'd react in new situations, but they tend to stay the same in the end. You can appreciate this in the characters, but don't look for any deepening of Belldandy and Keiichi's relationship, as I don't think it can get any deeper, but only re-affirmed to be as strong as ever.

As a treat, viewers will get to see the goddesses Angels, see many symbols of Norse mythology, which beforehand was only common in the manga, and hardly mentioned in the OVA. There's even a little Latin! The fight scenes are excellent, and you really see characters like Urd give it everything they've got.

Both the dub and the Japanese dialogue are excellent. I think that the voice actor for Celestin in particular did an excellent job. The character was great, and it's a shame the movie is his only real appearence so far.

But I highly recommend the movie, even if you never look into anything else of the Ah(Oh My Goddess canon.",1147478400,3,2994,4.678707224334601
1643008,5,B00005Q2Z1,"This was my first time ever seeing Belldandy and the cast in Anime. Up until this point I had only ever read the manga series. I must say that the voice casting is excellant and dialouge is thoughtful if not captivating. The story is very good and the graphics are pure eye candy. I will never part with this film from my collection unless DVD stop being produced and we all switch to another medium and, maybe not even then.

1643009,5,B00005Q2Z1,"This is such a great movie, but you really need to see the OAV/OVA series, or the TV series that came out last spring before you see this movie.

I am glad to say the entire movie has an excellent musical score, most of the time its a classical symphony with some of the scenes having a little bit of electric guitar and musical sound FX, It really helps the entire movie move along and creates a very cinematic experience and just seems to fit the entire movie perfectly.

The artwork and animation is very good, there is also scenes with cgi but its not fake looking and they don't over do the cgi in this movie either.

I have to say the english voice acting is very bad except for Belldandy and if you've already watched the series (hopefully you did) it just won't fit the character, heck it won't fit the character anyway. I watched the whole movie in japanese and then in english, and I couldn't even follow the storyline when it was in english since I was to busy thinking how crappy the english voice acting is. WATCH IN JAPANESE WITH SUBTITLES!!!

The whole series and the movie is one of the best anime out there(definetly ranks with evangelion), I could go on forever about how good this series is....but I won't.",1132531200,,1225,4.407079646017699
1643010,5,B00005Q2Z1,"This movie is easily one of the best anime movies ever. It has an engaging plot, fluid-like animation, and an excellent orchestral score performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic. Although it is very entertaining and pretty much stand-alone, viewers can benefit more if they get some background information on Kosuke Fujishima's work of the 3 goddesses and their earthly friends, since the movie doesn't spend much time introducing the characters and their relationship.

This DVD is practially a re-release of the old edition with the addition of Japanese DTS 5.1, which is only half bitrate. The video transfer is exactly the same as the old one. The old video is anamorphic and excellent to begin with, but you do get the same brief hard sub in two places in the movie. All the extras are literally carried over from the old release, including the mini-goddess episode. New is the inclusion of the TV and theatrical teasers and trailers and an art gallary. There is no reversible artwork and the keepcase is white this time.

If you are die-hard AMG fan or don't already have this movie, get this DTS release by all means. If you have the old release, you really don't gain much by upgrading.",1131408000,15,1190,4.8

1643040,5,B00005Q2Z1,I would just like to say that this is one of the best anime movies I've ever seen. The word masterpiece comes to mind when I think about it. I recently got the chance to get Hidenori Matsubara's autograph (He did the character design for the movie) and along with his signature he did a small sketch of Belldandy. I have got to say that still makes me smile everytime I see it.,1127174400,,377,4.178082191780822
1643041,4,B00005Q2Z1,"Ah! My Goddess the Movie will excite fans of the too-short TV series about a beautiful goddess named Belldandy who lives with an Earthling college student named Keichi.

The movie takes place about two years after the TV anime series ended.  The Amazon editorial review for this movie said Keichi looks more attractive and poised.  But nah - he's still the same old Keichi.  Skuld looks a little more grown-up, though.

The gorgeous Celestin comes to Earth to get Belldandy to help him implement his grand plan. Like Buddha, Celestin has lofty, noble goals of ending suffering on Earth.  Unlike Buddha, his methods involve evolving Earth's life forms thousands of years into the future.  Belldandy does not remember the terrible truths of her and Celestin's past.  Celestin has an ally, the butterfly-like fairy, Morgan, who has been greatly wronged by the Celestial Goddess System.  Morgan poses as a college student in order to get close to Keichi and Belldandy.

The animation in this movie is incredible.  The backgrounds are perfect.  It is just like reality.  One shot of Morgan hovering over a bay I had to pause and just gaze, amazed.  I felt I was there with her.  The whole movie is so realistic I cannot emphasize it enough.

The ending is touching and may make you tear up.  It is highly Disneyfied, however.  Any anime fans who prefer darker or Goth-type fare would not be impressed.  But if you are a believer in positive thinking and true love, this is your cup of anime.

I was very disappointed that we did not even get to see Belldandy and Keichi kiss!!!! It has been TWO YEARS since she has been living with him, and it is implied that their relationship has not been consummated.  What is up with that?  It is like watching a priest and a nun.

Extras include an art gallery with some stunning art, some of which I would love to have as posters on my wall.  There are Japanese TV commercials and movie trailers.  There is a short cartoon about the ""Mini Goddesses.""  Although I love the idea of chibi goddesses, this short stinks.  It involves Urd torturing this poor rat named Gan-Chan.

Although it is very entertaining and pretty much stand-alone, viewers can benefit more if they get some background information on Kosuke Fujishima's work of the 3 goddesses and their earthly friends, since the movie doesn't spend much time introducing the characters and their relationship.

Anyway, I enjoyed the movie so much that I went out and bought the soundtrack CD :)",1115856000,,513,5.035294117647059

The Animation is wonderful, the Music is very moving, and you will fall in love with the characters. The climax of the movie was my favorite part(it was the song that got me) and I highly suggest if not buying this DVD, then seeing it in some way.",1115251200,,387,4.173333333333333
1643044,5,B00005Q2Z1,"I own this DVD and I don't intend to depart from it. This is one of the most valuable anime collection I have.

The story plot is great. It's like a sequel to the OVA series and a great production too. The graphics and the soundtracks add essence and atmospheric emotions to the whole story. I ended up buying the soundtrack too.

The graphics were excellent, especially the scenery/background. It caught my attention, especially the moments that Belldandy have with Keichi. The sakura garden moment, with the soundtrack, stunned me.

The soundtracks were excellent. Not only I critic it from movie point of view and also from the soundtrack that I bought. You 'll reminisce the nostalgic events when you listen to the music. A plus would be Nobuo Uematsu from Final Fantasy is involved in the soundtrack production. A collaboration from Shirou Hamaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, come on, you don't get that in every anime. Though, out of 27 soundtracks, I do dislike 2 songs. But the rest are good... real good.

The story was excellent. It has several twists, emotional scenes, flashbacks/history and of course a good ending. Wouldnt own a bad ending anime.

I do recommend this DVD, though some people may prefer other anime. But from the point of production, storyline,soundtracks and graphics, you won't regret it.

It seemed to ""drag"" a little bit because its as if the story keeps going on and on in circles but then it picks up and it ends beauitfully. The series Oh, My Goddess (this is the movie) is great too, but this movie is worth watching After you see the series DVDs. Overall, I'd watch the movie again by myself or with a friend, because it does take you on a adventure.

Another plus is there's also see a bit of Urd in her younger days in this movie. The movie nicely adds a bit more to both Belldandy's and Urd's ""backstory""

Normally I find Anime movies unsatisfying, but this one was truly beautiful.  It had everything I wanted: all of the above already mentioned.  I really fell in love with the characters.  They're just so, pure (well most of them anyway), and they're people you can really admire because they're so unselfish and loving.  Belldandy's such a great character, and I like how she's so innocent and no one can corrupt her, even if they try.  Though she really has a lot of wisdom too.  The movie does a good job of giving equal time to the characters, and allows them to reveal their true selves.
The animation is of highest quality, and really does equal the manga in detail and style.  And it's in glorious color.  The characters are all so cool!  Keichii is such a decent guy, Belldandy is truly a goddess, Urd oozes sex appeal, Skuld is innocently funny, and you even feel sorry for the ""bad"" guys.  This is really a feel-good movie.  Everybody cares about each other and love is a real big theme.  I love it.  It's my only Anime movie DVD, actually - because it deserves to be bought and watched on DVD.

1643083,3,B00005Q2Z1,"I think Amazon reviewers are far too generous in their 5-Star reviews.  That should be reserved for all time classics like Neon Genesis Evangelion.

The main problem with Ah! My Goddess is the main character, Belldandy, is hard to like (besides having a silly name).  She's absolutely perfect and subservient in every possible way.  She's too syrupy sweet and meek to build a show around.  I'm just not a big fan of romance anime -- with its ankle-length ponytails, 3 foot-long bangs that defy gravity and poofy gowns.
And I'm unfamiliar of the Japanese concept of Heaven, but this show mixes witchcraft, magic, Norse mythology, computer technology and the tradtional Christian belief of Angels.  It's never explained why/how each ""goddess"" has an Angel alter-ego growing out of her back.  However, the concept of a technologically driven Heaven is rather interesting (it looks like the White Room from Matrix Reloaded).  But this movie is also loaded with a lot of Star Trek Voyager type technobabble. ""The LMT is down to 12%!!!""
The last third of the movie is where the real action is and it's stunning to watch -- a real end-of-the-world battle.  Action fans should skip ahead or risk being bored to tears.  But I found the romance to be trite, teenage, and treacly.",1078012800,2,1269,4.88785046728972

But I do recommend that you find about a little bit about it or you may get a little confused of how Belldandy and Keichi meet.
Even without seeing the OVA or manga you can still enjoy this great movie like I did.
The main plot is there is a fairy princess named Morgan Le Fay.
She had released a crimnal who is a god named Celestine. Not too long after that Celestine infects Belldandy with a virus that affects all of heaven and later earth. Morgan stays on earth as a student at Neckomi Tech the college Keichi goes to and watches them. The virus affects Belldandy in a way that she only loses her memory of Keichi. I think I will stop here so I don't spoil the movie for you. You will just have to see the movie yourself and you won't regret it.
The animation is really nice only cause its a theatcal release. But the character designs are different of that of the OVA and Manga. Pioneer did great with this DVD. The extras include the first episode of the Adventures of the Mini Goddesses which if you don't understand alot of japanese humar and culture you may not like it or understand it. Then you have some artwork like with most DVDs and some original japanese trailers. In all this is a great movie and one to keep if your a fan of Oh My Goddess or looking at it to see if its for you.

Excellent theme/story line....some great lessons about love and trust...Somewhat of a slow start, but very action-packed for the last 70 minutes or so!  I love how they reveal the story little by little as the movie progresses...(if you're confused in the beginning, your questions will be answered later on)...
Probably the ONLY con, and it's a minor one for me -- There are a few things that appear in the movie that must have been introduced in the manga (comics) series because I'm not familiar with Yggdrasil or even the goddess' angels.  So, it took a little brainpower (at least for me), to fill in the missing pieces, but that's just an incentive to watch it again and again!
Not sure if all DVD's are like this, but mine came with some artwork and one episode of the mini-goddess adventures.  Some very cool extras!

It's more of a movie of the manga rather than movie of the anime but it is by FAR better than the anime! It is well worth the price and the episode 1 of mini-goddess is great! with Art gallery extra's too which help if you're wishing to do a cosplay of one of the characters at an upcoming anime convention or something!

1643098,3,B00005Q2Z1,"It's like watching ""Oh! My Godess!"" the series... only with much less character development, humour, story line and, well, original drawing.
Not only does it look like the entire movie was done by the tem who did ""Tenchi Muyo!"" (maybe they DID do it?), but Keichii looks almost identical to Tenchi Muyo! Plus Celestin's little ""pin-version"", it looks just like that enemy guy from ""Tenchi Muyo The Movie""!
Also, the movie lacks the humour that the show had. It's all about drama and soap-opera-ish drama now, what with the new girl trying to seduce Keichii and all. Plus, the final battle to save Yggdrasil was a bit weird. Saving the world through singing?
This is like some kind of light version of the tv-series. And it's made for those younger than those who watched the series. And why are all of the angel-versions of the goddesses blonde?!?!?!",1049241600,2,850,4.789115646258503

Instead of being happy all the time Beldandy and Keiechi's relationship takes a tragic turn.  Heaven is in chaos and they have nowhere to turn to for help.  And to top it off the Earth is at the brink of destruction by a forced evolution.
The graphics are excellent and the sound is superb.  Also the scene ""Beldandy vs Urd"" is without a doubt the most artistic fight scene i've ever seen in any genre of anime or film.  It was only between two characters and it had a epic and urgent feel that had me on the edge of my seat.  Rent or buy this movie!  You will enjoy it.",1041552000,24,716,4.057142857142857

It is easily one of my favorite animated films of all time, even beating out the majority of Miyazaki and Disney animated films.  It's definitely my favorite animation outside of Miyazaki's works.
However, I STRONGLY discourage any and everyone from even considering the dubbed VHS. To put it simply, the dubbing is, well, God-awfully terrible. Never in my life have I heard a set of voice actors/actresses that believed LESS in what they were doing, not to mention having as little talent and appropriateness for the roles which they are supposed to portray as these people. Admittedly, I never made it past several dialogues by the main characters (Keiichi and Belldandy) to hear the voice acting for the secondary characters (Uld, Skuld, and the Motor Club).
Closing thoughts? While I may seem like a purist, an anime geek, or even *gasp* a zealot (I definitely am an anime geek), I cannot, in good conscience, reccomend the English voice acting for ANY Ah! My Goddess video.
Besides, as a local cinema marquee proclaims: ""Subtitles build reading skills.""

There's also a character, Morgan, who seems to want to steal Keiichi away from Belldandy.
My thoughts: I wouldn't recommend watching the movie unless you've seen the OVA (or read the manga). The Goddess System is a little strange, some things happen that are predictable, but the idea of Belldandy's mentor was nice, and we get to see her angel. The characters of Celestin and Morgan were designed well, but I don't like how they changed the way Keiichi and Urd look. Keiichi is adorable in the OVA, but here he's a bit weird looking. Urd's hair in the OVA is much better. It's good, especially if you're a fan of AMG, but it gets four stars instead of five because of the predictability and the change in Keiichi and Urd (who are my two favorite characters in AMG).",1037577600,,1110,4.72680412371134

So I got the DVD... only to find a story that tries to combine End of Eva with Oh My Goddess. For those who haven't seen End of Eva, or any Evangelion, it is basically a story of people coping with the end of the world. And the end of the world is being caused by someone who beleives that through destruction things are purified. If only these themes from the Oh My Goddess! movie were not so directly similar to End of Eva.
Also, these themes do not work well with the Goddess characters. Sure it all fits together in a happy, somewhat clich ending, but they would have been better off making more episodes surrounding issues of the manga. Like when Keiichi turns into a woman. In a way, the movie is more linked to the manga then the OAV anime. For example, in the beggining, Belldandy is singing with her angel counterpart. This is not explained in the OAV but there is a whole series devoted to it, with Urd and Skuld getting them to.
So, for the most part, this is an entertaing movie that does not do a good job of representing the Oh My Goddess! world. But as a fan or the series as a whole, I found it worthwhile to see.",1029024000,2,1264,4.100806451612903

The animation was beautiful, and the voice acting was wonderful.  I was very pleased to find that all of the original seiyuu (voice actors) were employed to make the film.  I also liked the parallels to the manga that were missing in the OVAs, such as the ""goddess spirits"" within Belldandy, Urd, and Skuld.  But beyond these things, I was disappointed.
The movie had little to do with the original series.  All of the same characters were used, but it didn't seem like a continuation so much as...something else entirely.  The story just kind of comes out of nowhere, and it doesn't have the light romantic-comedy feeling that the OVAs had.  The movie was trying to make Ah My Goddess into a serious drama, and I just don't feel that it was ever meant to be one.",1028678400,2,1016,4.574585635359116

Some drastic portrayals of romance, comedy, drama, and violence have been colorfully represented in the anime world, far more so than live action filming.  So it follows that when a romantic story is set to japanese cultural philosophy and artistic presentation, you get a lovely story like this one.
Poor Belldandy loses her loving memory and is forced to re-learn much of her blessed belonning to Keiichi and his world.  All the cast returns as well as the lovely Peorth.
What makes this movie worth owning is the subtle ""heart-string tugging"" that occurs regularly through the movie.  The script is beautifully crafted, the struggle is understandable, and the conclusion is...

Why didn't I give it 5 stars then?  Because in my personal opinion, it kind of violates the whole feel of Oh! My Goddess.  It starts out great, there is still the romantic overtones as well as plenty of humor to be found (the scene where Tamiya is in the muscle suit trying to convince people to join the auto club was hilarious!) but that soon stops as Celestine arrives on the scene.  After the first half hour there is scarcely a humorous moment to be found, which is different from the oav's where they mixed humor and romance very nicely.

The animation is just beautiful.  The integration of computer graphics and hand-drawn art is amazing.  Everything was very detailed and I'm really glad this is the first movie played on my computer's DVD player.
The storyline is basic cut and dry material; Good vs. Evil, Love and War, etc.  I think the 13 and up suggestion on the box is a little steep.  There is no real reason for the 13-year-old age limit, because there is no nudity or language that would cause it.  And the BASIC story line can be followed easily, and I have not seen the TV series.  But as good as this movie was, I probably will be very soon.
If you like anime, your collection isn't complete until you get this movie.  The lack of action, violence, and ""fan service"" (i.e. nudity) is a welcomed change that cannot and should not be missed.",1026604800,3,974,4.5

Although the characters retain the same personalities and quirks, the animation is gorgeous and the story is very intriguing there are a few issues that nagged me as I viewed. Firstly, Belldandy is the most flat, one-dimensional character I have ever seen in any story or anime. Even in the manga she isn't perfect, and often makes silly mistakes that show off her naiveity and ignorance of Earthly life. The primary focus of the series, secondly, is the relationship between Keichi and Belldandy, which the movie makes out to be perfect. This is just silly. Many of the confrontations the Goddesses have in the manga are influenced by Keichi's awkwardness and Belldandy's submissive nature. These things are totally overlooked. Third, of course, is the dub. Bleh. Skuld is NOT Sasami, and Peorth is not a drag queen, thank you ...!
If you're interested in a beautiful, tragic fairy-tale style story with influences from several mythologies and cultures, told with gorgeous imagery and flashy animation, this may be your ticket.

It inspired me to try one of the manga novels (a ninja one) which was very cute, but acceptable(I avoid the Sailor Scouts as much as possible). I think the appeal would extend to younger teen girls (up to 16 at least).",1026086400,,613,4.433628318584071
1643146,5,B00005Q2Z1,"I find that even though I had no previous experience with the series before seeing the movie I found it easy to follow.  After watching the series I came to the realization that the Movie in itself only touches upon the series, using mostly just  the characters.  Excellent this movie maybe but there were quite a few places for improvements.  The first was that it was rush a little bit, Second most of the characters lacked depth only dynamic changes were seen, third it was anticlimactic it basically cut off after the climax no slow downhill resolution just a quick jump off a cliff.  Despite this it's animation was spectacular at times seeming real, the voice acting was very well done, and even though it was short had a good plot.  This is my opinion and in no way defines the movie I fell that each viewer should make his own conclusions, but if you like anime with romantic touches I do highly recommend this movie",1024963200,2,924,4.536144578313253
1643147,4,B00005Q2Z1,"""Ah! My Goddess: The Movie"" is a fine piece of work, directed by the same genius (Hiroaki Gooda) who brought us the original OAV series.
The movie is set after the events of the OAV's, and involves a ""low-class"" deity named Celestine who rebels against Heaven.  His ultimate plan is to create a new ""system"" for the world to run on, in which everyone experiences happiness without suffering.  It seems to be a good enough idea, except changing destiny and Heaven's plan for the people of Earth doesn't exactly find favor with the gods.  Not only that, but he is actually using his top student, Belldandy, as his catalyst, which threatens her relationship with Keiichi, the love of her life.  The story basically goes from there, combining deep elements of romance with intense action sequences in a splendid, heart-rending ballet as Bell's sisters, Keiichi, and Heaven itself try to put a stop to Celestine's plan.
It pays to know a little about the ""Ah! My Goddess"" universe before watching the movie, as elements from not just the OAV's, but the comics as well, make appearances in it.  It doesn't take away from very much not to be familiar with them, but it does help with the enjoyment factor.  Belldandy's third sister, Peorth, and the goddesses' angelic ""helpers"" make their animated debuts here, both of which first appeared in the comics.  There's also an in-depth look at how Heaven operates in the ""Goddess-verse""; I thought the idea of it being like a giant computer program was pretty neat, especially as Celestine's ""system"" infects it and the ""virus"" spreads.  The story moves along at a fast enough pace to hold attention, and the action and intensity as everyone races against time and the system gives the heart rate a little boost.  The most prolific moments in the movie, though, are the tender ones, as the power of love makes itself known.  We're talking gushing, drippy, sappy kinds of moments rarely seen at this level in anime; they were prolific in the OAV's as well, and that kind of sentiment is basically the mainstay of this series.  Yes, I'll admit, they even moved a guy like me.  (But just a little!)
The animation is spectacular; I expected nothing less, and I wasn't a bit disappointed.  The computer animation blends flawlessly with the hand-drawn, which can be tricky.  The English dub is superb, drawing on veteran voice talents as well as Pioneer's own pool of vocal radiance.  Bell's voice in English is as liquid-honey as the original Japanese, and the rest of the cast's voices matched the characters' personalities to a 'T'.
All told, this flick is an awesome visual and emotional feast that will likely satisfy anime, romance, and ""Ah! My Goddess"" fans for a while to come.  (Although if you're turned off by ""mushy stuff"", this flick may not be for you.)  The extras on the DVD are few, but treasures indeed; you get a free mini pencil board with the Special Edition, and ""The Adventures of the Mini-Goddesses"" sneak peek is hilarious and a hundred times cuter than the original series, but I think more kids than adults will enjoy that.  Highly recommended!",1024963200,4,3103,4.8007518796992485

If you enjoyed the 5 OVA episodes, then this movie is a must!  People who liked the Tenchi series will also enjoy this series as well I believe.  While you can watch the movie without seeing the OVA first, I think it would make a lot more sense and you will get a lot more out of it if you have seen the series.

The story takes place three years after the OAV. And again Keichii and Belldandy's love is put to the ultimate test. The story is well written, easy to follow and the themes are seen as plain as day. Good vs. evil, morals and ethics challenged, and our beloved characters stuck in the middle of the fray. Truly an enjoyable and memorable movie.

Mi diosa y tercero, que padres dibujos. A BellDandy la dibujaron excelente, no me gusto mucho como dibujaron a Morisato pero su caracter es casi identico como en el comic, a Urd creo que le falto que la pusieran a trabajar un poco en su Hobbie que es crear pociones para el amor (yo pregunto, por que le gusta tanto eso y no tiene novio?) y a Skuld le falto un poco de que apareciera un poco mas ayudando a las diosas. El final de la pelicula no das un ejemplo de que no hay que dudar uno con su pareja, siempre quererla y no hacer mensadas como las de hoy en dia. Belldandy es una muestra de la mujer ideal, lastima que no existe hoy en dia, solamente hay rastros de su persona como la amabilidad, la ternura, entre otras.

She plays a strange role in the movie compared to what she is in the Manga... but thankfully they've added her into it... considering all 3 of the Goddesses are mentioned...

The music is moving, well deserved for gods and goddesses. My girlfriend was also watching this movie for the first time and loved it. But she complained on how it got a little technical in the end. It did not really bother me since I was engrossed with the story.

1643192,5,B00005Q2Z1,"Three goddesses, motorcycles, Heaven as a computer network, demons, and one boy with it all around him.  Where else but Ah! My Goddess!?
Ah! My Goddess the movie focuses on Celestine, a god whom after being released by faeiry princess Morgan Le Faye from his Lunar prison, has rebelled against Yggdrasil and wants to end human suffering.  To do this, he needs the power Belldandy holds within herself.  He travels to Earth where he erases all the memory of Belldandy since she came to Earth... mainly all of her memories of Keiichi!
This is a great title from Pioneer/AIC.  It helps to have watched the original AnimEigo OVA series before seeing the movie or at least having some background from the manga series (for instance, the movie carries a few references that are not explained in the OVAs).  This is somewhat supposed to be a 'stand-alone' movie, but the complexity of the series deems it otherwise.  The movie also carries many symbolic symbols that Ah! My Goddess fans should recognize immediately, some I can't list because that would be a spoiler ^_^.
Being a fan of old-school anime, I'm not really in computer graphic (CG) animation, but the CG used in the Ah! My Goddess movie is done real well and the overall animation is quit nice.  If you've watch the third Tenchi Muyo movie, the characters look very similar in animation style to them (no surprize as the animation company behind AMG the movie is the same that did the Tenchi Muyo animation, AIC.)
Voiceovers are also done great, including the dubbed voices which reflect their OVA counterparts well, except Skuld who now sounds like Sasami from Tenchi Muyo and Keiichi's voice is considerably different.  Sound effects and the soundtrack is equally impressive and enjoyable.
The first episode of The Adventures of Mini-Goddess side-story is cute and enjoyable, but a little too short.  It provides us with a look of the series that will be released by Pioneer soon.
Be aware also Kei/Bell fans that this movie goes into their relationship more than the OVAs ever did.  It actually gets a little disturbing at times and then becomes quite lovely again.  Also the humor found in the OVAs are nowhere to be found here.  The movie is quite serious with only little humor here and there.
Overall, I say this is a fabulous anime title as is the series itself.  If you haven't bought this title yet, do it now!  You'll enjoy it.",1013644800,4,2394,4.751207729468599
1643212,5,B00005Q2Z1,"What can I say about Ah! My Goddess! the movie?
The art is simply beautiful. There's no other way to put it. And the music is soft and glorious.
When Belldandy's old mentor, Celestine, escapes captivity for a sin he committed long ago, he erases his former pupil's memory as part of a cunning scheme to overthrow Heaven once and for all.
Belldandy's love, Keiichi, and her sisters, Urd and Skuld, set out to try to recover her memory, using Belldandy's love for Keiichi to try to reawaken her sleeping memories. But what they don't know, is that that was precisely what Celestine was counting on.
And we learn, as events progress, that Celestine's war against Heaven grew, not out of a desire for personal power, but instead, from a need to protect the innocence of Belldandy from the harsh cruelty in the world.
A moving story with colorful characters, and a great date film.
And then there's the delicious bonus of the Adventures of the Mini-Goddess! Watch as Goddess of Love, Urd, tries to play matchmaker to a hapless rat named Gan.
The English dub for this one is actually pretty good. Familiar voices from such series as Robotech and Cowboy Bebop can be heard very prominently, especially in Keiichi and Celestine.

The animation it top par, plus it also is combined with some very good looked 3D GCI type effects (mainly used in the scenes dealing with the ""Goddess Network"").

The best part is however, that you don't even need to see the OAV's or read the Manga!

1643217,3,B00005Q2Z1,"In 'Ah! My Goddess: The Movie,' the world is threatened by a god who wishes to create a reality where no mortals have to suffer. He forces an unwitting Belldandy--a goddess who has been bound through love to Japanese college student Keiichi--to serve as the main vehicle of his plot.
The movie features all the characters from the long-running comic book and graphic novel series (published in America by Dark Horse Comics and translated as ""Oh My Goddess!""), including recent additions to the cast such as Belldandy's rival, the goddess Peorth and the various angels tied to Belldandy, Urd, and Skuld. In many cases, the film assumes that the viewer knows who these characters are, which in my mind is its main flaw. While readers of the graphic novels and comic books can be somewhat up-to-date--as of this writing, ""The Fourth Goddess"" where Peorth first appears has been released, but the Whirlwind motor company that's referred in the film to will still be an unknown if one only reads them and not the monthly issues--and there are a host of characters that will remain mysterious to those who may be coming to this film from the other animated episodes alone. If the filmmakers had weeded down the cast a bit, there would have been time to provide brief introductions to everyone and the film would have been better for it.
The animation quality is very good, taking advantage of both traditional and computer animation to convey the strange power of the film's supernatural beings who live by the addage ""sufficiently advanced technology is equal to magic""; in the ""Ah! My Goddess"" universe, reality is maintained by a super-computer running incredibly advanced programs, and  all supernatural beings are, basically, ""remote terminals."" The animators have remained true to creator Kosuke Fujishima's character designs and mix of cartoony and hyper-realistic art, and the characters of the film seem very much grounded in a world not far removed from our own. The result is a very attractive-looking film that captures the look of Fujishima's comic art very nicely.
The English-language dubbing is better than average, but I think the casting could have been better. Belldandy is entirely too whiny and Urd isn't husky/assertive enough from how they should sound based on their portrayals in the comic.
Story-wise, the film also captures the feel of the comic quite nicely, with the real plot revolving around Belldandy and Keiichi's love once again surviving supernatural challenges and emerging reconfirmed and even stronger than before. (No, that's not really a spoiler; anyone who has even passing familiarity with ""Oh My Goddess"" and romantic films of this nature go in expecting a happy ending.) Unfortunately, the story fails to successfully revolve all of its subplots and themes by the time the film is over. The chief of these is the race that the NIT Motorclub is preparing for during the film. It's there to underscore the fact that Keiichi and Belldandy are the perfect couple, and it should have been returned to at the end. (Eliminating some of the characters who don't play any role in the story but who are just there because they're part of the graphic novels might have given the tme needed to properly wrap up the film's loose elements.)
The flaws of this film balance its good parts, hence the Three Stars (an average rating). I recommend it highly to fans of romantic comedies and the ""Oh My Goddess!"" series... but I do so warning you that it is far from a perfect work.",1012089600,,3500,4.932203389830509

1643220,5,B00005Q2Z1,"Being an anime fan and having owned only two anime DVDs, I decided to extend my collection, and ended up purchasing this DVD from amazon.com.  I had watched and enjoyed the entire Ah My Goddess series at my University's anime club, so when I learned it had a movie, I just had to check it out.
My reaction . . .
Wow.  I agree with the other reviewers, this is a great anime movie -- one of the best, in my opinion.  The storyline wonderfully intertwines romance, drama, action, and comedy.  The animation is gorgeous -- even the obligatory CGI sequences used in all modern anime movies blends in very well here.  And the movie actually lasts much longer than one-hour, a place where few anime movies dare to tread!
But the DVD itself is what really makes this a must-buy.  If this was released by a major Hollywood studio, it would be called a ""Collector's Edition.""  Two things that Amazon surprisingly does not advertise is that the DVD comes in a stunning holographic cardboard sleeve (similar to the Moulin Rouge one) and also includes a limited-edition pencil board -- which I still don't know what is used for. :)  And I love how the plastic keepcase is transparent, a refreshing change from all the black cases I own.
The widescreen video transfer is flawless without artifacts.  As for audio, the Dolby 5.1 track is the best I've heard in a long time, with every channel guaranteed to be utilized during the battle scenes!  Of course, for anime purists like myself, it's great to have the original Japanese 5.1 track as an alternative to the English one.
The menus are very attractive, with a combination of vivid pictures, animation, and sound and music.  Plus, the transitions from one menu to another are well-done, yet still fast enough so as not to be annoying.  Finally, the extras are impressive: an art gallery, five Japanese trailers, and the short but hillarious Episode 1 of the upcoming ""Mini-Goddess"" series.  Perfect Blue is the only anime DVD I've seen that surpasses this in extras -- but that one didn't come with a pencil board! :)
The only problems one might have with the movie is the storyline.  The ending does leave several loose ends.  And if you haven't seen the series, you may find the story confusing at first (although the DVD insert does provide some information on the main characters).  Finally, if you haven't enjoyed magical girl anime in the past (Sailor Moon, Card Captors, etc.) and go for more serious fare, this might not be for you.  Evangelion it ain't.
Otherwise, with beautiful packaging, an engaging story, bright animation, superb video and audio, many extras, and a reasonable pricetag, the Ah My Goddess movie is an impressive DVD that'll make the perfect addition to any anime fan's collection.
Oh, and don't forget the pencil board!",1009756800,3,2789,4.74120082815735

1643232,5,B00005Q2Z1,I just wanted to say that this movie really moved me and kept me on the edge of my seat to see how things would turn out.  The art of this movie is stunning to say the least.  I was surprised to find that it was all right to see the movie without any prior knowledge of what has happened before this.  This movie was a good love story that drew me to the characters and made me feel their emotions.  The english Dub was done rather well.  I prefer Dubs because it does not interfere with the viewing enjoyment.  The Japanese voices were good but I really enjoyed the Dub.  The movie really looks good on the technical aspect of things. Top of the line.  Pioneer really does a good job with their releases and this disc is no exemption with the sheer quality of the Video.  The keepcase is clear with an almost holographic cardboard slipcase cover that goes over it and shimmers with diferent colors.  This really goes well with the imagery and idea that the people in the show are special.  The cover is of the main Goddess Beldandy with the inside cover being reversible in a way.  The inside has a nice plastic card that I thought was a nice bonus that added to the quality of this release The liner notes/ inside jacket is really well done with some character bios.  The whole release is just stunning....  My hats off and many thanks to Pioneer for such a great release.  For other discs with a love story in a fashion like this would be Tenchi Forever and Kimagure Orange Road: Summer's Begining.  Those were two discs that I highly enjoyed that are similar to this in high emotion and great animation (art).  If you had hesitated to buy this release like I had because you had not seen the shows leading up to this.  Don't wait..... The story can be enjoyed without having prior knowledge of the events that had led up to this.,1009065600,,1833,4.341176470588235
1643233,5,B00005Q2Z1,"I haven't seen Oh My Goddess in atleast 5 years, and then it was a fan sub, I enjoyed the OAVs a lot then, but never bothered to get good quality copies.
I bought this DVD on a whim one day when it caught my eye. I am so happy that I did. This is one of the best anime movies i have seen in a long long time. It is beautifully drawn, the packaging is great, and has more extras then on most anime dvds. It is definitely one of the best quality anime dvds i own. After watching this i rushed out and bought the OAVs on DVD. Now I am debating on getting all the manga too. This movie totally sucked me back in to the series.
I don't think you need to have watched the OAVs before watching this movie, I mean I knew the basic idea of how Belldandy and her sisters came to be in Keiichi's life, from what I remembered of the original OAV. Of course it always helps to fully know the background story.",1008460800,6,896,3.9285714285714284
1643234,5,B00005Q2Z1,"This is one anime movie that will surely grab your attention! The animation is crisp and stunning and the visuals are breathtaking! This is a story about true endurance of love and the struggle for control between Heaven and Earth. Fans of ""Oh! My Goddess""  should definitely  add this to their collection. The story is strong and character development is good. The sudden twist toward the end will take you to the edge of your seat . This is a movie that all viewers can enjoy!  It's a must to have for your anime library!",1007856000,,523,4.484210526315789

Basically, this is one of the most beautiful anime movies EVER created.  It is different from your usual style of anime, but will touch you in a completely different way.  The pictures are gorgeous, so were the music and the storyline was top notch.  This movie has just become my all time favorite movie ever.  Everyone owe themselves 106 mins and see this masterpiece.",1007856000,,491,4.651162790697675
1643236,5,B00005Q2Z1,"Sure it helps if you've watched the OMG cartoon or read the comic, but the characters are written and drawn so fantastically that you can watch it without an in-depth background... but it does help :)
But for the fans who haven't seen it...definitely treat yourself to this now!!
New characters, old characters, those who haven't appeared in the five previous animated episodes... you even get to see Peorth (minus her French accent), and each of the Goddesses using their angels!
And then there's the episode of the Mini-Goddesses.  Slightly bizarre, but very entertaining... I can't wait to see more next year!",1007856000,,612,5.0
1643237,5,B00005Q2Z1,"I had recently viewed the Region 2 subtitled version of this movie.  Since Oh My Goddess is my favorite anime series, I'm really glad that Pioneer Animation released this DVD for the US.  Pioneer has done a wonderful job with this release with not only the packaging, but the content of the disc as well.  The first episode of Adventures of Mini-Goddess is a great sneak peek of more to come of this series to be released.  This movie will attract current fans of the series, as well as newcomers.  Newcomers should also watch the OAV Series released by Animeigo to understand the background and the story of the characters.  The movie picks up 3 years after the arrival of the goddess Belldandy into the life of college student Keiichi Morisato, in which he had wished for her to be his girlfriend forever.  Now, their love for each other is put to the test as a part of Belldandy's past returns and threatens our reality.  The OAV series itself was sweet and romantic, with the movie emphasizing the true love between Belldandy and Keiichi.  If you have not seen this series at all, this is a definite recommendation to make.  You won't be disappointed.",1007683200,4,1155,4.617647058823529
1643238,5,B00005Q2Z1,"I saw the VHS and VCD version of this movie before.  The DVD is much better than all the versions and formats I have seen before.  The wonderful illustration and graphic presentation is breath taking.  The color is rich and free of defects on my Proton monitor.  The audio is also very well done.  I played the movie using a Pass multi-channel amplifier, Elite DVD player, Lexicon sound processor and B&W N803, N805 & HTM1 speakers.  The sound is warm with full bottom, not dramatic yet smooth transition between 5 channels and good depth. The voice duping appears to be the same as the VHS tape, OK.  The subtitle has mismatch to the voice in a few areas, I turned it off.  It would be great if the subtitle is more accurate so I can listen to the original Japanese voice and read the subtitle.
I was delighted and highly recommend this DVD to you.",1007424000,,849,4.432258064516129
1643239,5,B00005Q2Z1,"As a HUGE fan of Kosuke Fujishima's work of Oh My Goddess, I was really stoked for the movie to finally make it's way here. The animation and music are both top-notch, and far surpass that of the OAV series (which in itself wasn't bad either...). The story was also good, however, to give fair warning, I have every Oh My Goddess! comic and all the OAV's. This means that I am privy to the backgrounds of each and every character I saw in the movie. If you haven't read the comic, I think it's still a great movie, but you'll probably gain a new appreciation for it after reading some of the older manga on it. The only bad part about the film was the fact that the music was sometimes so loud that I couldn't hear the dialogue, and it didn't matter how high or low my volume was either. Other than that minor quibble, a great movie, especially for the truly devoted Oh My Goddess! fan (like me!).",1007337600,,897,4.251461988304094
1643240,5,B00005Q2Z1,"I've seen this movie several times already (even in a moviehouse here in Japan in Japanese), and I tell you, you won't regret having this title.  The story is so moving, and until now, I really can't believe that there is such an animation like this!  But, one word of advice, before buying/watching this, be sure to watch first the OVA series to fully understand the whole story.

1643241,4,B00005Q2Z1,"The megamisama movie is beautifully drawn, with fluid motions and bold use of colour (see the scene when Celestine appears in front of Belldandy).  The character design is true to the latest style of Fujishima sensei's drawing, which is distinctly different from the OVA.  The plot itself is twisty and focuses a lot on Belldandy and Keiichi battling through their emotional problems.  A true masterpiece.  Although viewers who are used to the extrovert Holywood style are advised to glue their eyes on the screen for the subtle changes in facial expression and voice pitch, which is typical of Japanese story telling.
However it does have a few problems.  First of all, for fellow viewers in the US who probably have seen the OVA, but generally do not have access to all (the latest) 22 volumns of the manga; you might be wondering who Chihiro and Peroth are, and the movie never attempts to explain these major characters from the manga.
And for those who know Fujishima sensei's story well, you'll notice there is a discrepancy in the time line - in the movie, Keiichi is still a student while Chihiro's garage has already opened.  This discrepancy probably doesn't matter too much for the movie's plot, but it's irritating for a fan like me, who keeps wondering while watching, how come Chihiro's shop could open without Keiichi and Belldandy working for her.  Who's changing the oil?  Who's keeping the cash register?
The movie also seems at times to bring in characters just to please the fans.  (I do admit seeing familiar characters on the movie screen is quite a treat)  But honestly I don't find it necessary to bring in Megumi or Chihiro in the plot.  And the one thing that really irritates is the appearance of Noble Scarlet.  Everybody familiar with the story knows Skuld's angel is Noble Scarlet, but everybody familiar with the story also knows that Skuld doesn't have an angel (digest this!).  The sole purpose of her appearance is to please the fans and make the scene look good with all three angels (from all three goddess)battling out with Morgen.
Although there are a few reservations from a fan's point of view, it shouldn't stop anybody from enjoying this wonderful film, whether you're familiar with the manga's story or not.  I'm sure everybody will find it rewarding to watch.",1004054400,17,2303,4.841836734693878

7949453,1,B00005Q2Z1,"Despite all of the angels and other supernatural creatures populating the world of ""Ah! My Goddess,"" it's really, first & foremost, a domestic comedy.  At least, that's what the TV series was.  It's about luckless college student Keiichi Morisato sharing a house with Belldandy, his magically gifted not-quite-girlfriend.  (""Not-quite"" as in they both clearly love each other but are too emotionally constipated to say anything.)  Also living with them are Belldandy's two equally supernatural sisters, the sultry Urd and the bratty young Skuld.  Personalities clash & comedy ensues.  Think ""Love Hina"" meets ""Bewitched.""

The movie has the same premise and characters as the TV series.  (In fact, like many anime movies based on ongoing series, it assumes that you're already familiar with its convoluted premise and doesn't spend any time bringing you up to speed.)  But the tone is entirely different.  Instead of the wacky domestic hijinks caused by a human living with three super-powered goddesses, the movie is a somber, action driven story about Belldandy's former mentor/almost-boyfriend turning evil and trying to conquer the world with a giant magical tree.  (Or something.  I had a hard time following it.)

I suppose, if you're in the mood for a dense, impenetrable anime action fantasy (and lord knows there seems to be an audience for that), ""Ah! My Goddess: The Movie"" is right up your alley.  But if you're, like me, a fan of the Anime Works/Funimation TV series, you're not going to find the same sense of light sitcom fun that you're used to.",1432339200,,1561,5.094488188976378
