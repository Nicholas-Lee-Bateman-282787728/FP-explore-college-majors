8599970,2,B00E1C4SB0,"Two stars because Simon Keenlyside is one of my favorite baritones. The staging, however, was difficult to watch. As other reviewers have noted on this site, since the singers are older than the characters, they are doubled by younger non-singing actors. However, this was not done consistently, making it hard to follow. In the next-to-last scene, the orchestra played the dance numbers, but instead of seeing the dances, we see Onegin embracing a number of anonymous dancers, apparently to portray his empty existence following the duel. A piece of scenery from the duel scene was left on stage for the final act. One particularly bad director's choice was that Gremin appeared on stage during the final duet between Onegin and Tatiana. In early versions of the opera, Gremin entered while the duet was in progress, hastening Onegin's exit. However, Tchaikovsky changed that so the it would be clear that Tatiana was acting out of conscience, not fear. Why did the director assume that the composer was wrong? I am not saying that directors should have no leeway, but this production just confused the issue.",1495411200,,1110,5.038043478260869
8599971,4,B00E1C4SB0,"Eugene Onegin  an opera both intimate and epic, an opera filled with deep emotion, with profound themes of innocence and experience, old love and first passion, death, friendship, the passage of time, and most of all, regret. Regret for sins committed in short-sighted anger; regret at paths not taken, loves spurned, lives wasted. Some things can never be undone nor put right. They become burdens of regret and unhappiness.

Holten brings out this important theme. But he does it clumsily, overburdening the intimate, fragile emotional nature of many of the operas heart-rending scenes. Having doubles of Onegin and Tatyana is distracting and confusing at times  what is recollection and what is not? And some of the scenes Keenlysides Onegin is bystander to are ones Onegin was not originally present at. How can he be remembering Lenskys sad Kuda, Kuda as the poet waits for Onegin to arrive for the duel? The duel scene, particularly, suffers from being torn in two. Yes, Onegins sad, remorse-filled recollections were moving (acted masterfully by Keenlyside). But they took away from what was happening between Lensky and Onegin at the duel. For me, the dancer playing Onegin did not embody him well at all. Keenlysides Onegin had far more emotional intensity and nuance.

Pavel Bresilks Lensky, blessedly unburdened by dancer doubles, is phenomenal. He embodies the sensitive, ardent young poet perfectly, and his voice is staggeringly beautiful. I cannot imagine a better Lensky. His Kuda, Kuda is perfect. I was moved to tears by its profound emotion and delicate beauty.

Why do directors often have so little faith in an operas ability to be compelling as it is? Why do they feel the need for dancers, concepts, shock-value scenes, and all the other paraphernalia they so often insist on dragging in and throwing on the opera? And why were the chorus in this production dressed head-to-toe in black? A chorus of peasant women dressed like well-to-do Victorian matrons makes no sense, and is dull and ugly (the clothes, not the singers!). On the plus side, the production is visually interesting overall and does not bore. The set works reasonable well. The one real failing of it is that it does not convey a feeling of space and distance in the outdoor scenes. Out in the Russian countryside, it would not feel so close and boxed-in. It needed more wildness and space.

A great story like Pushkins Onegin, set to the lush, beautiful music of Tchaikovsky and played out by a wonderful cast of singers like these, does not need trinkets, trappings or mind-twisting reimagining. Eugene Onegin is a masterpiece. All it needs is to be allowed to BE a masterpiece.",1466553600,,2670,4.98876404494382
8599972,5,B00E1C4SB0,"This is one of the best operas I have ever seen. The way it was staged with Tatyana and Onegin singing, while doubles of them act drew me even more into the story. Keenlyside and Stoyanova are excellent in their roles as is everybody else. It is 1080i HD with 5.0 DTS-HD sound and 24 bit LPCM stereo. It also has a directors commentary of it. That is something I would like to see more of in operas. Don't pass this one up. It won a Gramophone award. It is highly recommended. I also own another one with Gavrilova as Tatyana which comes highly recommended by ClassicsToday as one of the best. I also bought another one with Stoyanova in it also with Bo Skovius. It also comes very highly recommended.",1412985600,,701,4.358778625954199
8599973,5,B00E1C4SB0,"Wow. I have seen Eugene Onegin both in performance and on DVD, but have never fully appreciated and understood the psychology and emotion of this piece as I have with this performance. Indeed, I don't think I have ever ""heard"" Tchaikovsky's beautiful music as I did here. The ""conceit"" of having younger versions of Tatyana and Onegin on stage at strategic and emotionally-charged moments in the opera works wonderfully. Indeed, it nicely deals with the fact that Krassimira Stoyanova and Simon Keenlyside would have trouble portraying their younger selves (given they were 50 and 53 respectively at the time of this performance). So we have the older Tatyana and Onegin looking back on the events that indelibly changed their lives and destiny, nicely explained in a set piece during the overture. It also allows for some very interesting stage positioning in the letter scene and duel, that serve to emphasise and expound the psychology of those scenes. One of the reviewers has bemoaned the presence of Lensky's corpse onstage throughout Act 3. I actually thought that was very clever, because it is easy to forget just what a horrific and life-changing event underlies the relationship between Tatyana and Onegin - one that neither of them can really forget (no matter how hard they try). This is a near perfect performance of this opera, by a phenomenal cast. There will always be naysayers. I do not like experimentation for experimentation's sake, but in this case the director has thoughtfully added to our understanding of this wonderful work.",1394496000,5,1552,5.06640625
8599974,5,B00E1C4SB0,"I read the one Amazon customer review of this DVD that was posted before I ordered it.  The review and comments on it were so negative that I decided to check for more review sources.  BBC Music Magazine had one review and it was totally favorable.  Then I found several interviews of audience members following a Royal Opera House performance.  These were mixed with a few glowing comments and others that were confused.  I found the production to be sublime, not only the outstanding artists' performances but also the staging and orchestra.  I then viewed the ""Extra"" material which is worthwhile.  Although Holten's comments were useful and made sense, they were too long.  The idea of presenting the story through Tatyana's reflections upon her youthful love for Onegin years after he rejected her worked exceptionally well.",1388966400,3,829,5.044117647058823
8599975,5,B00E1C4SB0,"The first time I saw this opera I love it and I've seen it two more times and each time I like it more.  Very good performance, lovely voices and really it is a very good opera.",1388361600,2,177,3.7837837837837838
8599976,2,B00E1C4SB0,"I saw this production broadcast in HD a couple of weeks ago and was less than impressed.  Once again we have a director, Kasper Holten, who seems not to trust his material.  Or perhaps he felt that, given the advanced age of his leads, Krassimira Stoyanova and Simon Keenlyside, he had to DO something.  The ""something"" in this case is double cast the characters of Tatiana and Onegin.  In addition to Stoyanova and Keenlyside (who are both in fine voice), the stage is populated with two young, beautiful performers who act out the story as the former stand on the sidelines and sing.  This works well in the letter scene, primarily because the mute Tatiana, a gorgeous dancer named Vigdis Hentze Olsen, is superb at capturing the character's torment as she writes her confession of love to the callous Evgeny.  If this were the ballet ""Onegin,"" I can't imagine a better person to embody the role.  The conceit, however, completely falls apart in the second act duel scene, where it is the mute Onegin who carries out the duel as Keenlyside is forced to emote awkwardly and caress poor Lensky (?!) -- a splendid Pavol Breslik -- who has just dragged an enormous tree limb onstage. And did I mention that Lensky's corpse remains onstage throughout the ENTIRE rest of the opera for everyone to walk around?

Seriously?  This is an almost perfect opera, simply conceived in seven short(ish) scenes, that needs no directorial folderol to achieve its maximum dramatic impact.  It's all there in the score, one of the most passionate, emotionally complex in all of opera.  Why undermine the opera's final moments by having Prince Gremin walk onstage and witness his wife's admission of love to Onegin?  Do we really need to see Keenlyside ""dance"" with a bevy of maidens during the Polonaise to chart his moral deterioration?  Compared to how Robert Carsen treated this section of the piece in his brilliant 1997 production, this is time-filling drivel.  Everything in Carsen's stark, spare, visually stunning production, in fact, puts this one to shame.  Even the Met's current ""Onegin"" by Deborah Warner (also broadcast in HD recently), despite its staid literalness, runs rings around this one.  In both cases you have directors who trust the material and their stars to tell the story without devices and gimmicks.  They're intelligent, psychologically sound treatments that do honor to the opera.  The Carsen version is available with Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Renee Fleming and it doesn't get any better than that.  On March 4 The Met will release theirs with Netrebko and Mariusz Kwiecien, two singers gifted and young enough not to need doubles sharing the spotlight with them.  I would certainly purchase either before this one; whichever you choose, you'll get to experience the intensity and power of ""Eugene Onegin"" unadulterated, as Tchaikovsky intended.",1382054400,20,2859,5.016949152542373
8599977,5,B00E1C4SB0,"The very nature of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin is one that often makes it difficult to cast and present. The opera is all about the arrogance, impetuosity and naivety of youth seen refracted through a lifetime of regret. As such, it has the near impossible task of needing performers capable of expressing both youthful idealism and the regret that comes with experience in the same person and - as if that wasn't difficult enough - express both positions almost simultaneously. Tchaikovsky's remarkable highly romantic musical score is able to do that, but finding singers who have the exact balance of youth and experience needed to express and actually sing the challenging roles is rather more difficult.

If it were a film, it would simply be a matter of just casting younger actors to play the youthful roles and then bring in experienced stars to play their older counterparts. In the opera house it's not possible - or at least not common - to cast in this way, and certainly not for roles like those in Eugene Onegin that have very specific singing and continuity demands. For the Royal Opera House production, Kasper Holten has opted for using doubles for Onegin and Tatyana, employing dancers to play their younger selves, and having them both on the stage together in order to allow those interlocking sentiments of youth and experience to play out simultaneously in reflection. As a response to the themes and the actual music itself it's a valid idea, but it's one that is rather more difficult to pull off theatrically.

It's not as if this kind of cast needs the additional dramatic support. Krassimira Stoyanova in particular is just phenomenal, delivering a sensitive and deeply nuanced performance that works well with the concept. When you see the youthful idealism and romanticism embodied in the expressions and the fluid movements of dancer Vigdis Hentze Olsen during Stoyanova's moving account of the letter scene - the older Tatyana regretful of her younger counterpart's painful naivety - it does actually enhance the scene and reflect those contradictory sentiments. Simon Keenlyside is a marvellous actor as well as a fine singer in this role, but the look of nervous excitement on the young Onegin (Thom Rackett) as he picks up a duelling pistol, oblivious to the reality of what he is about to do, while the older Onegin looks on with painful regret and unable to avert the disaster, is also justified and well handled. The death of Lensky, leaving Pavol Breslik lying there at the front of the stage through the remainder of the opera, doesn't work quite so well. The dead branch that he symbolically drags onto the stage would have been enough on its own.

Any such reservations however are few and minor when taken alongside the evident consideration behind the directorial choices elsewhere in this Eugene Onegin. The Polonaise is more than just a beautiful interlude here, throwing Keenlyside's Onegin with abandon into the midst of swirling ballet dancers that he attempts to grasp but is unable to hold. Tainted by his past and his behaviour, it seems like everything he touches just dies in his hands. Mia Stensgaard's set - a framing set of doors, opened or closed as necessary, with suitable backgrounds, colouration and lighting that enhances the moods - is also highly effective in establishing a consistent look and feel for the work. Tchaikovsky's score is superbly performed by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House under Robin Ticciati, who recognises its majestic romanticism but also its aching intimacy.

The colours and tones of the production design come over well on the Blu-ray, as does the music and singing. In addition to an optional introduction and interval feature, Kasper Holten provides a full length director's commentary, which is uncommon on an opera BD. I don't think the production needs explaining, but considering the unwarranted criticism the production received when shown at Covent Garden, the director clearly feels the need to clarify his intentions. Perhaps this is another case like the ROH Robert le Diable, which may indeed not have worked in the theatre, but its qualities can better be appreciated in close-up on film. The booklet contains a lovely insightful essay on the work itself by Marina Frolova-Walker that considers how Tchaikovsky's music expresses the content. Subtitles on the Blu-ray disc are English, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Korean.",1380844800,12,4440,5.061475409836065
