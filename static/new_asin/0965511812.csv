7793804,5,0965511812,"Tommy and Julia McDonnell live in our neighborhood and give classes in our community clubhouse twice a week. The workout takes twenty minutes and exercises every muscle in the body, including small muscles that most workouts overlook. It also stretches meridians to organs, and the organs themselves. This creates a euphoric sense of well being that leads to wishing to do the workout on a daily basis. A few weeks into taking the classes at the clubhouse, I bought the DVD, and now do qigong every day.
Here is a list of the movements and which meridians/organs are strengthened:
1. up and down - oxygen to brain, settle liver - composure, contentment
2. open drapes - exercise heart and lungs - love, completion, optimism
3. tree waving - strengthens stomach, digestive system, immune system, heart, nervous system, brain
4. dividing sky - exercise heart and lungs, refresh brain
5. pushing hands - exercises brain, opens channels in gall bladder, liver, and eyes
6. rowing boat - exercises the bladder, kidney, and gall bladder - feel centered and calm
7. lifting ball - lifting qi in grounded posture - uplifts spirit
8. looking at moon - exercises spleen, liver, and gall bladder, helps circulation, strength
9. push hands - exercises intestines and colon - aids digestive tract
10. cloud hands - oxygen to brain, relax eyes - peacefulness
11. looking at heaven - exercise heart and lungs
12. pushing waves - kidney, bladder, and feet - calm confidence
13 pigeon flying - heart and upper body - happiness
14. closed punch - intestines, colon - regulate digestive system, stabilize body temperature qi
15. big bird flying - lungs, upper body - happiness, contentment
16. paddlewheel turning - moves blood, cleans liver, gall bladder, kidneys, intestines, and colon.
cleans liver and gall bladder, improves energy
17. puppet - balances brain, improves coordination
18. regulate qi - oxygen to brain - stores energy, ends session.",1341100800,,1932,5.003105590062112
7793805,5,0965511812,"I purchased this DVD at the Flagstaff Yoga Festival last August and it has helped me SO much with back and shoulder pain, and I feel I can keep a calm mind during stressful times much more easily now. I use it about twice a week (unless I get lazy, then the pain always brings me back to it!) The style and pacing of the video is really nice and easy to follow. He takes you through the routine explaining it really well, and then you can easily go to just the routine sequence without the explanations after you are comfortable with the movements. Well worth the investment for me.",1312070400,2,582,4.3

7793807,5,0965511812,I love this DVD it is so easy to use.  Having the instruction section is great for initial learning and then a quick reminder of how to do individual  moves. I feel great doing Qi Gong. It is relaxing and empowering all at the same time. Needing only 20 min it is easy to fit it into my day. I always feel better and have a better day when I do Qi Gong.,1272585600,3,353,3.8219178082191783
7793808,5,0965511812,"I live in rural Wyoming where there is no chance to attend classes of this kind. This DVD gives me just what I need to be able to (1) learn the Qi Gong style of exercise, and (2) have someone I can do it along with. The instruction in this DVD is precise and clear, and very easy to follow. After you learn it, the DVD also gives you the choice to follow the instructor in a session without instruction. This made me feel like I was in a group and it has helped me keep motivated. This is also my first introduction to Qi Gong and I have to say that as an exercise form that is simple and easy, it also gives you one heck of a work out. I look forward to doing it every day now.",1272499200,6,678,3.85
7793809,5,0965511812,"I'll start by saying that the criticisms of this video are true:  the recording quality is poor, the setting is rather bland, and the instructor is very low-key and does not seem accustomed to being in front of the camera.  The first time I used the video, I was bored and I didn't know if I'd end up using it much, but I decided to give it a chance.

I'm so glad I did, because after three days of practicing this method of Qi Gong, I experienced an amazing, rapid and unexpected healing.

I had had severe hypothyroidism for almost two years, and the endocrinologist said I'd need to take Synthroid (thyroid hormone medication) for the rest of my life.  After the third day of practicing with this video, I began to experience symptoms that I quickly realized were signs of hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone).  My own thyroid gland had started working again, producing a normal amount of thyroid hormone, and the medication I was taking put the total amount in my body over the top!  I was able to discontinue the medication completely.

This happened back in 2001, and in these 7 years I have never needed to resume the medication.  All of my thyroid tests have been normal and I've had no symptoms.  And that's without even practicing the Qi Gong consistently.  After the beginning, I've only done it for a few weeks here and there -- perhaps because the production of the video is, in fact, uninteresting to me.  I did, however, buy 2 extra copies in case the first one wears out or gets damaged, just so that I'd have it for a long time.

I wish that they would re-make this into a higher-quality production on DVD that would be available through a large, well-marketed company like Gaiam so that many more people would have access to the great healing potential of this Qi Gong method.

I am very grateful to the makers of this video.  Thank you, Tommy and Julia McDonnell, for the healing that you have enabled me to experience.",1204416000,2,1944,4.545977011494253
7793810,5,0965511812,"This VHS should be a part of everyone's library.  It is easy to follow and may be used by anyone from age (2 to 100).  I have recommended this VHS to  friends who are recoverying from surgery or an injury, training for a  sport, or just plain depressed. The exercises are not strenuous and if  necessary may be performed from the sitting position.  It makes you aware  of your breathing, it cleanses the mind, and it calms the body.  This is  done by moving the energy within you and around you.  This is an excellent  tape.",966816000,36,524,4.354166666666667
