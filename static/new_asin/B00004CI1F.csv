1338947,4,B00004CI1F,"Relatively good film in the low budget sphere of eighties horror,has cliches all over the place but still worth watching. Quite a body count of victims but not too much blood or gore ,the budget really shows here. In between murders there are quite of few aerobic workouts with girls in spandex. The music goes between bouncy workout numbers to early synthesizer music,solid soundtrack. Now to the Blu-ray transfer ,it is just a copy of a PAL Betamax tape so don't expect much. I only reason it is done in Blu-ray instead of DVD is so no one will wait for the Blu-ray. There are about 5 times your really notice this is a copy of a tape watching the movie. The worst is when one of the soon to be in victims is in her apartment,it looks as her lights are flickering in a strobe effect and I expected her to call the electric company on the phone. Then the flickering stops and you realize it was the tape. The other bad tape moment happens during the credits ,if you care about who did the songs in the film you are out of luck ,screen goes very blurry and you can't read a thing. Other than that a few times you can tell where the tape got very badly treated and it was beyond help. The 3 special features are 1)An eight minute photo montage with music stills from the film ,storyboard screens ,pictures of the various vhs releases and pictures of the actual source tape for the Blu-Ray 2) A Fifteen second beginning sequence with the ""Killer Workout"" title (The main film uses ""Aerobicide"" as the title 3)The coming attraction commercial for the Blu-Ray ,not the theatrical trailer .",1447891200,3,1585,4.450171821305842

1338949,5,B00004CI1F,"This transfer for the blu-ray looks so much better than any release (bootleg or otherwise) ever distributed. It was created using the only known master (PAL Beta SP) from the owner's personal collection. The original 35MM was destroyed by the storage company where the master was stored in, who were located in a different country. The greater resolution on PAL is clearly visible when watching this transfer (mastered in April 2015)-originally to be released on DVD only, the quality of the film was agreed upon to have it available on blu-ray as well, but only if an agreement was made to allow a disclaimer on the release. This was agreed upon, so now we will finally see Killer Workout on the best format available.  //",1438992000,13,723,4.784

Killer Workout (1986) *1/2 / 4
D: David A. Prior
C: Marcia Karr, David James Campbell, Ted Prior, Teresa Van De Woude
P: The members of a small gym are killed off one by one by a killer with a grudge.

Who knew aerobics could be so deadly.......or so sexual? I think it's pretty fair to say that the people behind Killer Workout didn't take the material seriously. There's one aerobic sequence after another in which the woman engage themselves in all kinds of sexual gyrating while wearing the skimpiest outfits possible. It took me back to the days of watching USA's Up All Night as a teenager and the phone sex ads that would pop up during the commercial breaks, but with some murder sequences tossed in.

In between the sexual gyrating, there's some dialogue, but large portions of it are inaudible as an overbearing music score drowns out whole sections. Maybe that isn't such a bad thing?!? The killer uses a large safety pin as their weapon of choice. That's different. I will give them that, but come on, how many people would be scared of a giant safety pin?

The rest of the film is padded out with fist fights, bad dialogue, police procedural, more bad dialogue, a laughable title song and a ridiculous twist ending. Killer Workout seems like the type of film that had all the workings of a cult classic. It could have been godawful, but entertaining. It's also incredibly misogynist. Offensive films always pique my interest, even if I hate them. Yet somehow or another, Killer Workout not only manages to be godawful and offensive, it also manages to be boring. [R] 85 mins.

1338953,4,B00004CI1F,"No one seems too concerned when a woman is found murdered at a popular gym.  But the bodies start to pile up as the killer gets revenge on the clueless gym members. Soon even the police can't stop the carnage.
 My favorite parts of Killer Workout were:
A)The aerobics montages; back in the eighties women dressed like hookers when they worked out.
B) The Flashdance rip-off soundtrack; they clearly spent more money on the soundtrack than on the special effects.
C) The hilarious fight scenes between the gym meatheads(in one scene a guy gets stabbed in the leg with a rake).
D) Despite the daily homicides people keep coming to the gym

Just a matter of which format you like better. Some cool features on it, great 80s soundtrack. This falls in line with a movie like Death Spa so if you liked that film this might be up your alley.

1338962,5,B00004CI1F,"At last Killer Workout (aka Aerobicide) has been given an official release! This is my personal favorite Prior's brothers film - a campy celebration of the slasher genre that also nods to the fitness craze of the 1980's. Lots of blood and T&A (Dianne Copeland, oh my), plus bodybuilder brawls, a crotchety detective, incredible pop songs, mullets, Ted Freakin' Prior, and a riotous twist ending. This is B-movie gold for horror geeks and VHS hounds like myself, and if you're a fan of retro-horror/late night flicks then believe me you're gonna wanna get your pump on at Rhonda's Workout.

Slasher Video (who has also given us DVD and Bluray editions of cult gems like Deadly Prey, Cemetery Sisters and Boardinghouse), did an excellent job in polishing up the PAL Beta SP they received for the release (the best known copy of the footage remaining, as the original 35mm print was destroyed). The image is sharper and clearer than any VHS copy you might have or the bootlegs you'd find floating around horror cons. Not only is the image as clear as we'll ever get (it is from a master tape, so there are occasional blips), but the sound quality is excellent - none of the fuzz you get on VHS transfers to DVD. Some may moo and cough about the image being boxed or not being in HD, but Slasher Video is very upfront about the quality and ratios, and they did a nice job cleaning up a film that was on the edge of extinction, persevering it for future generations.

I want to point out that the negative reviews on here are actually reviewing a previous release of this film by ""Mom and Pop Video"", a bootleg outfit. So, any reviews of this product that you read from before 2015 should be disregarded. This edition is stellar.

So what are you waiting for? Grab your leg-warmers and let's get ready to Aerobicise! Watch out for that safety pin!!!",1448236800,7,1844,4.598784194528875
1338963,5,B00004CI1F,"Let's get real.

You know this movie is cheesy.  If you expected top-notch storytelling and eye blasting cinematography and rich production values, there's something wrong with you.

Killer Workout has a few objectives.  Show women working out in tight spandex.  Murder people every ten minutes or so.  Deliver obvious red herrings.  And throw in the nudity we all love and appreciate.  And the wild '80's music, man, how can you not love it?  And Ted Prior's character is hilarious.

The kills aren't super gruesome.  The killer's identity is easy to figure out.  Killer Workout is cheapjack as heck.  Yeah, and so what?

Killer Workout is more of a fun ride, rather than a movie you should critique on normal standards.  '80's slashers should be excited.  This is bad trash cinema at its best.  '80's tastic.  Very much appreciated as a retro horror movie.

Special features are slim.  I would've loved an audio commentary, or an interview.  That would be my only complaint about this release.",1447977600,10,995,4.909090909090909

7919757,4,B00004CI1F,"I had pretty good time watching this one.  Not sure if it was the fun soundtrack, endless workout scenes, insane fashion, or the Maker's Mark.  Pretty bad video quality, but kind of added to the fun for me.  Slasher video (and Editorial Review on Amazon) gave a warning about the picture quality, but it didn't really both me. A couple extras, and overall a fun time.",1503187200,,367,4.53030303030303
7919758,5,B00004CI1F,"This is what all cheesy, so bad they're good horror movies should aspire to be. The characters are over the top; the fashions are the worst of the eighties, the deaths are creative but weird (some of them involve a giant clothes pin), and there are multiple musical montages of buxom women doing aerobics. I love every second of this movie no matter how many times I watch it. If eighties cheese is your thing, give it a shot. You won't regret it.",1501718400,,447,4.397590361445783
7919759,4,B00004CI1F,"Low budgeted cheesy but really good 80s slasher movie.  Imagine Olivia Newton-Jones workout videos meets any non-slasher in the wood slashers.  The movie features some nice ideas, an excellent soundtrack and lots of 80s nostalgia!  If I have to complaint about something, it has to be the lack of suspence and mystery as some ppl will find out who's the villain within the first 10min but if you like B-grade horror and don't mind about its budget I would suggest to grab this classic!",1477267200,,485,4.75
7919760,2,B00004CI1F,"I probably would have enjoyed this for it's campiness, but I couldn't get over that the film was sped up for this blu ray release. It even says on the back of the blu ray packaging, that the film was transferred from PAL video sources, so, I'm guessing whoever did the conversion didn't have the proper tools for the job. Around the 27 minute mark it slowed down to it's normal NTSC speed, then went back to the chipmunk effect- at this point I sadly turned it off. This transfer ""killed"" it for me. If I come across this on VHS, maybe I'll give it another go.",1476662400,,560,4.242990654205608
7919761,5,B00004CI1F,"So, my friend told me about a movie she had watched when she was a teenager. It sounded amazing, but she was unsure of the name. Fast forward many years, and we discovered it was called ""Killer Workout"" or ""Aerobicide."" I'd seen clips on YouTube, but really wanted to see the whole glorious, garbage dump that I knew this would be. Someone eventually reached into my dreamcatcher and made that a reality. And on Blu-ray even! I mean, not that it really matters, since the quality would be heinous no matter how fancy the technology it was transferred on to. Anyway...I bought it and with the help of Amazon Prime, it arrived in 2 days. I made my friend come over and surprised her with a viewing. DEAR GOD. This movie has it all! Jazzercise! Leotards! Ridiculous dialogue! A pretty predictable plot twist! Mullets! AND MURDER! Seriously though...watch this movie. The only thing that disappoints me is that they never released a soundtrack to this garbage gem.",1475452800,,960,4.754491017964072

7919763,4,B00004CI1F,"File under: So bad it's entertaining. This ain't low budget, it's NO budget. Killer Workout is pure 80s SOV cheese. Big hair, bad acting, and bloody murder. Bodacious babes sweatin' to a sweet score of 80s pop tunes catchier than Hep-C on skid row. Seriously, the songs are pretty great for what they are and should be released on a spandex colored vinyl someday. Can't I dream? Anyway, there's a fight scene in the 2nd act that'll go down as the best bad fight scene you'll ever see...during this movie.

Believe it or not, there's actually a hint of talent in dir. David Prior's work that pushes Killer Workout beyond the typical tedium that plagues many SOV films. Characters are cardboard cutouts sporting tank tops and spandex-clad booties, and the dialogue is mindless and laughably flat. If you're even thinking about buying this, you're probably well aware that the flaws only add to the allure and cheesy brilliance. Sure, the talky parts between kills drag the run time to a crawl, but never long enough to drain the raunchy magic. And the best part? There's enough low rent goodness and wacky 80s charm to warrant repeat viewings.

Killer Workout was my intro to the nutty SOV universe, and now I'm hooked. So grab a headband and purple spandex, slide a cassette into your Walkman, and strap on your pink ankle weights...this is one Killer Workout!",1461456000,2,1359,4.778723404255319
7919764,5,B00004CI1F,"You can't beat a slasher made in the 80s. Now days they make slashers that try to have that 80s feel but nothing beats the real thing. Killer Workout is everything you want in a slasher. 80s music, nudity, cheesy story, dumb characters, you get it all here. And damn those tight spandex outfits! This is a classic of the genre",1460246400,,326,4.360655737704918
7919765,3,B00004CI1F,"The name of the movie and a glance at the cover will likely gauge your overall enjoyment of Killer Workout.

Killer Workout tries to do a few things: feel like a montage, show as much girls in skimpy clothing working out, provide the weakest weapon in the history of the genre, and show occasional glimpses of nudity. It's a low budget B-horror with over the top characters, dry acting, and all the one-liners and campiness you can possibly take and then some.

The fact that it's unintentionally funny makes this one an interesting choice for a bad horror movie marathon/binge. The film has some of the most humorous fight scenes l've ever seen in a movie. It also features probably some of the most unintentionally comedic death reactions in the history of the genre along with the most ridiculous and un-scary murder weapon in a horror film.

As for the storyline, there's not a whole lot to say. Ronda Johnson owns Ronda's gym when, of course, something goes wrong. Murders start to happen and he gym's population decreases by the day. It's quite funny how people still continue to work out there despite all the murders actually.

It's worth nothing that some characters are rooted so deeply in stereotype that it's almost as if their only purpose is to exist as stereotypes. It's hard to figure out exactly where Killer Workout takes itself seriously and when it doesn't (or if it does at all). You know what, it's part of it's charm.

I will admit that although some of the aspects don't make much sense -the murder weapon and the fact that everyone keeps working out at the gym after the murders- it features an interesting and unexpected twist at the end. As is so often the case with horror, it leads you to believe one of the characters is the killer and then, surprise! I give the movie some credit because the backstory is creative and unlike anything l've seen before.

Interesting enough, the title sequence says Aerobicide, which is what the movie was originally called. For the the record, Killer Workout is a much more effective title and hits it home.

If you didn't know any better, you'd swear Killer Workout was a spoof of 80's films. It combines cultural cornerstones such as the fitness craze with slasher films. Time hasn't been especially kind to Killer Workout and as a result it serves as a passable horror/comedy slapstick piece of cheese. It's memorable for being bad to the point where it starts to become good. If you came here looking for '80s cheese, look no further you've hit the holy grail. Don't expect great horror, just embrace it for what it is. 3 stars.",1459036800,,2595,4.677631578947368
