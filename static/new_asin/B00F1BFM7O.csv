5963117,1,B00F1BFM7O,"Although the website claims that the purpose of this show was to see if ""modern forensic science"" can ""uncover new clues"" about the assassination, it is obvious to anyone with more than two working brain cells that looking for ""new clues"" couldn't have been further from the minds of its producers and participants. Its true purpose was to rehabilitate the findings of the long-discredited Warren Commission by ""proving"" the Single Bullet Theory, and to dispel notions of a second shooter and, therefore, a conspiracy. In so doing, the producers of the show and its two ballistic experts, the father-and-son team of Luke and Mike Haag, cherry-picked and misrepresented the actual evidence in the case and shamelessly misled millions of viewers. A review of the facts fudged or ignored in Cold Case JFK demonstrates that the SBT is as impossible now as it was in 1964 when it was first proposed by Commission lawyer, Arlen Specter. And that the evidence of a second shooter remains as strong as ever.

The first and most obvious deception in the show is the elevating of JFK's back wound into his neck. This, of course, is what the Warren Commission did nearly 50 years ago in order to facilitate the SBT. They were able to get away with it then, for a short time at least, because they didn't publish the autopsy photos and instead published a deceptive drawing prepared at the direction of pathologist James, J. Humes. For their computer animation simulating the path they claim the bullet took through President Kennedy, NOVA turned back the clock to when we were kept largely in the dark on the medical evidence, and adopted the Commission's entrance location. But as the makers of the show know full well, because they say so themselves, JFK's rear entry wound was not in his neck as the Warren Commission claimed, it was lower down on his back. In fact, according to the nine-member forensic pathology panel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), it was below the shoulders and below the wound in the throat. (7HSCA92)

So what would happen if a bullet entered at this point in the back and followed a straight-line trajectory out the front of President Kennedy? The Discovery Channel knows the answer to this question. Because when they attempted to simulate the SBT in the real world, shooting at specially made torsos from a crane set at the height of the sixth floor window of the Texas School Book Depository, precisely as common sense would dictate, the bullet, travelling on a downward trajectory of 20 degrees, exited through the chest! This simple fact is, by itself, enough to invalidate the SBT. The makers of Cold Case JFK obviously knew this and so they moved the back wound inches above where it actually was in order to make an impossibility appear plausible. Thus their blatant dishonesty and their desire to validate the SBT at all costs was immediately revealed.

Of the many objections raised to the SBT over the years, critics have had a hard time accepting that the bullet itself, dubbed Commission Exhibit 399, could have pierced seven layers of skin and flesh and smashed two bones only to appear in virtually pristine condition on a stretcher in Parkland Hospital. And it hasn't just been Joe public who has found the notion difficult to swallow. For example, famous pathologists Dr. Milton Helpern and Dr. Cyril Wecht both strongly objected to the Warren Commission's premise. In his 1979 testimony before the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Dr. Wecht remarked that he had repeatedly urged his colleagues in forensic pathology to come up with one bullet that had done what it was alleged CE399 had done and remained in such remarkable condition. ""...at no time"", he said, ""did any of my colleagues ever bring in a bullet from a documented case...and say here is a bullet...it broke two bones in some human being, and look at it, its condition, it is pristine."" (1HSCA337) More than 30 years after Dr. Wecht's testimony, we are still waiting for a similar example to be produced by defenders of the SBT.

For Cold Case JFK, Luke and Mike Haag pretended to address this issue by firing a Carcano bullet into pine boards. What they found is exactly what the late  Dr. John Nichols reported decades ago; Carcano rounds are capable of penetrating three feet of pine whilst remaining in a near-pristine state. Which is all very interesting. But it doesn't address the real issue: What happens to Carcano bullets that penetrate flesh and bone? Thankfully, tests performed for the Warren Commission at Edgewood Arsenal have already answered this question for us. Shown in a photograph on page 849 of Warren Commission Vol. 17, CE853 represents a bullet fired through the rib of a goat. It is severely flattened with its lead core extruding from its base. CE856 (Ibid, p. 850) is a bullet fired through the wrist of a human cadaver and it exhibits the ""mushrooming"" effect typical of a bullet that has struck bone. Each of these bullets has broken only one of the two bones attributed to CE399 which, as you can see, looks virginal by comparison. None of this was mentioned by NOVA. Instead, one of the show's talking heads, the objectionable John McAdams, tried to assure viewers that CE399 is more damaged than they've been led to believe. ""If you look at it end on"", he claims, ""it's mashed very considerably"". Mashed very considerably? CE399? Who's he trying to kid? For his 1985 book, Reasonable Doubt, author Henry Hurt performed his own tests. As he wrote, ""Firing these bullets into water consistently produced nearly pristine slugs, strikingly similar to the Magic Bullet."" (Hurt, p. 385) In actual fact, the test bullet pictured in Hurt's book looks almost exactly like CE399, slightly flattened base-end and all.

So how the hell could CE399 do all that damage and emerge looking just like a bullet that had been fired into water? This is an important question that supporters of the official fairy tale have struggled for decades to adequately address. But according to the Haag team, the answer lies in the supposed fact that the bullet was ""yawing"" or ""tumbling"" when it struck Governor Connally. This is actually not an original claim, it's as old as the SBT itself. And just like the SBT, it's based on little more than the desire of its proponents to believe it's true.

To demonstrate their point, the Haag team fired Carcano rounds through blocks of ballistic soap and gelatin, presumably meant to simulate JFK's neck. Leaving a gap of three feet--which they claim is the distance from JFK's throat to Connally's back--they placed a ""witness panel"" made of sheet rock at the exit end of each block. According to the show's narrator, ""The witness panel records the bullet's orientation after exiting Kennedy's neck."" A close-up of the mark left on the panel by one of the test bullets shows a complete profile, demonstrating that the bullet was flying sideways when it struck.

Haag then informed viewers that ""Connally's coat has this kind of a hole in it"". ""And"", the narrator added, ""so does Connally's back, according to his surgeon."" This is pretty much what I expected they would say and yet somehow I was still disappointed by the dishonesty. The average viewer would take it for granted that what NOVA was telling them was accurate. But it wasn't. It was a blatant misrepresentation. If we look at the images accompanying this claim, we see the words ""small"" and ""roughly elliptical"" which were lifted from the testimony of Connally's thoracic surgeon, Dr. Robert Shaw. Just how small is small? Let's check Dr. Shaw's testimony and find out:

SPECTER: Will you describe Governor Connally's condition, Dr. Shaw, directing your attention first to the wound on his back?
SHAW: When Governor Connally was examined, it was found that there was a small wound of entrance, roughly elliptical in shape, and approximately a cm. and a half in its longest diameter, in the right posterior shoulder, which is medial to the fold of the axilla. (6H85)

So, according to Dr. Shaw, the entrance wound was only 1.5 cm long, which is half the length of the bullet and half the length of the mark left on the witness panel. The holes in the Governor's coat and shirt were approximately the same length, measuring 1.7 and 1.3 cm respectively. (7HSCA138-41) Clearly, then, the bullet was not flying sideways when it struck Governor Connally. I'm sure that the Haag team would still argue that the roughly elliptical nature of the wound was still evidence of a tumbling bullet. But then they're going to have to explain why the entrance wound in the back of President Kennedy's head also measured 1.5 cm (ARRB MD3). Was that also tumbling? If so, why? Their own tests demonstrated how stable Carcano rounds were before striking a surface. So what had that bullet struck before it reached JFK 's head that caused it to yaw? In truth, we don't need the Haag's to answer these questions. Because, as Dr. Shaw explained in his testimony, an entrance wound is often elliptical when it ""enters at a right angle or at a tangent. If it enters at a tangent there will be some length to the wound of entrance."" (6H95) So, whatever the Haag team or any other Warren Commission apologist wants you to believe, there is no good reason to conclude that the bullet was tumbling when it hit Connally.

But NOVA dropped in another fact that they wanted viewers to believe supports their contention that the Connally bullet had already struck Kennedy: the lack of ""bullet wipe"" around the entrance hole in Connally's jacket. As Haag described it, ""bullet wipe"" is the ""smudgy material on the surface of a bullet that literally wipes off as it pushes through the first surface it encounters."" By bringing up the lack of bullet wipe on Connally's jacket, Nova makes the implication that it couldn't have been the first surface the bullet touched. Honestly, even after they moved the back wound up into the neck, I still couldn't believe that NOVA tried to get away with this one. The truth is that whether JFK and Connally were struck by the same bullet or not, no bullet wipe would have been found on the Governor's jacket. Why? Because before it went to the FBI for examination, Connally's wife sent his clothing to the cleaners! In fact, FBI Agent Robert Frazier testified that because of the cleaning, he couldn't even state for certain that the hole was made by a bullet. (5H63) It is my belief that if NOVA knew enough to know that there was no bullet wipe on the jacket, then they had to know that it had been cleaned before examination took place. So once again they deliberately tried to hoodwink their viewers.

And it wasn't just the already established facts that NOVA and the Haag's misrepresented to make their case, but also the results of their own experiments. ""In test after test"", the narrator opined, the Carcano bullet moves straight through tissue simulant, but tumbles when it re-enters the air."" Luke Haag added, ""That was a real surprise. I can't explain it..."" The impression they tried to create was that the bullets stayed straight and true until, in Haag's words, they were ""back out into the atmosphere"". The reason he can't explain it, is because it's not true. Just a few minutes before making those claims, NOVA showed the path a bullet took through a block of soap. As is obvious from the close-up shot, the bullet moves straight for the first few inches, creating a straight and even channel through the block. But as it gets near the exit, ""the wound path gets wider"". This, Haag explains, is because it is ""just starting to yaw"". That's right, it starts to yaw before it gets ""back out into the atmosphere"". And, in fact, one of their tests through gelatin shows this just as clearly because the bullet is flying almost vertically as it exits.

So why the lie?

The answer is JFK's throat wound. Parkland Hospital's Dr. Malcolm Perry described this wound as being approximately 3-5 mm in diameter (17H29) and having all the appearances of an entrance wound. As he explained in his Warren Commission testimony, ""It's edges were neither ragged nor were they punched out, but rather clean cut."" (3H372) Dr. Charles Carrico concurred describing the wound as ""4 -7 mm...It was, as I recall, rather round and there were no jagged edges or stellate lacerations."" (6H3) Dr. Ronald Jones summed it up as a ""very small, smooth wound."" (Ibid, 54) It is perfectly clear that if indeed a bullet did exit JFK's throat, it was not tumbling. Just compare the above descriptions to the images of the exit hole created by a bullet ""starting to yaw"" its way out of the block of soap. The viewer can see that it looks nothing like the wound described by the Dallas doctors so NOVA knew they couldn't get away with saying that the bullet was tumbling as it left JFK's throat. Instead they pretended that the bullets in their tests didn't start tumbling until they re-entered the air even though they had already demonstrated otherwise!

The animation also depicts the bullet entering JFK's neck, which is too high. Even the HSCA agreed that the entry wound was in the upper back. The exit wound in the gelatin block (representing the throat wound) is pretty big, bigger than the rest of the bullet track. The bullet is clearly tumbling before it leaves the block. That's not the way the Parkland witnesses described the small, neat, round hole before it was altered by a tracheotomy. It also looks like they have the wall and the gelatin block spaced too far apart to represent JFK and Connally, though I can't be sure.

5963124,5,B00F1BFM7O,"Broadcast 50 years after the event, this Nova special based its findings on the results of a recent and thorough scientific testing of the same kind of Italian rifle used by Lee Harvey Oswald.  This was done by a father-son team of firearms experts and is very convincing.  They concluded that most likely Oswald fired all the shots that hit the President and Governor Connolly on that day in November 1963.

The show also interviews people who were there at the time, including the Secret Service agent who climbed on the back of the limo during the attack. But it is the evidence from these new ballistics tests -- done with modern techniques and equipment for the first time -- that makes the case.

The bullets that rifle uses are remarkable because they use a full metal jacket -- a lead core covered completely by brass -- and they have a blunt tip,not a pointed one.  This means that the bullet is gripped tightly by the rifle barrel as it runs it length, making for a very clean journey through the air.  They found that it could penetrate 3 feet of pine wood; that the one that hit the President in the back almost certainly was the one that did strike the governor.

They make the case in a number of different ways, trying to tie up any loose ends as best they could after so much time has elapsed and some of the evidence was mislaid, even at the time.  They interview experts on wounds, for instance.  There is a lot of detail in this episode, and they did a great job of trying to test everything they could.

This is another look at the JFK Assassination. What a person thinks of this case tells something about them, says one speaker. You see people like Josiah Thompson, G. Robert Blakey, etc. Clint Hill, Secret Service Agent, was there and tells what he remembered. Parkland Hospital was experienced in trauma cases. A fired cartridge case identifies the rifle used. The bolt action Carcano is slower than some other rifles and uses unique ammunition. The alleged assassin was killed while in police custody! Was it a conspiracy? The Warren Commission was created to end suspicions. There was no autopsy done, as required by Texas law. Later it was done at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda by physicians who were not experienced medical examiners. A bullet was found on a stretcher in Dallas. Finding a bullet on a stretcher is only proof that it was planted there. While Oswald bought that rifle by mail, where did he get the rare ammunition for it? Thats another mystery.

The Zapruder movie film was used to study the event. Only 1.6 seconds elapsed between the two shots, but the Carcano rifle could not be re-fired in this time! Governor Connallys testimony conflicted with the Warren Commissions findings. This film shows recreations of the shootings using pine boards and ballistic materials. The reaction of JFK to the second shot shows his body moving backwards. The House Select Committee to Investigate Assassinations decided there were two shooters from the acoustic evidence. Reverberation creates multiple sound reflections. A rifle shot creates supersonic noise in addition to the muzzle blast. A laser can measure events (not available then). The skull provides information about a wound (entry/exit), so too the damage to the brain. The photographs were studied. Did the entrance wound line up with the sixth floor window? Were there unexplained facts?

This movie is an example why a book or magazine article is superior to a video drama: you can easily go back to review earlier statements. Note who put up the money to produce this show. Who pays the piper calls the tune. Will this show change anyones mind if they have already reached a conclusion? Did Oswald shoot a rifle that day? No, a paraffin test on his face disproved that theory. But someone else could have used his rifle when he was at the second floor lunchroom. Oswalds background suggests he was involved in some sort of intelligence operation.  There was no mention that four empty cartridges were found there, one in the rifle. What about the fourth shot? You can read many books on this topic. No one has written an Opposing Viewpoints book to contrast opinions. There is no conflict over the fact there were political changes after JFK was replaced.

Josiah Thompson wrote Six Seconds in Dallas. G. Robert Blakey, a law professor at Notre Dame University and General Counsel to the House Select Committee to Investigate Assassinations, also wrote a book with his solution. So did Mark North, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. The assassins of Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley boasted of their act. So too the shooters who tried to kill T. Roosevelt, FDR, Truman, Ford and Reagam. Oswald is unique as an assassin in denying guilt before he was quickly silenced. On the 50th anniversary the corporate media parroted the Warren Commissions findings although about 4 out of 5 Americans believe there was a conspiracy. What conclusion can you draw from that? This show doesnt work for me. One worker placed Oswald in the lunchroom from noon to 12:30 pm; he could not have fired a rifle from the sixth floor window (JFK and the Unspeakable). Jesse Ventura, Dick Russell and David Wayne wrote They Killed Our President; Chapters 11 and 12 will tell you more about that rifle.",1395878400,2,3791,4.926447574334898
