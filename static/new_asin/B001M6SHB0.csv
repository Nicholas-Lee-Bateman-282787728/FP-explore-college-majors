8320589,5,B001M6SHB0,"Without a doubt. It's fast-paced, it's weird, it's quirky, the songs are catchy and I love every single minute of it. I have no idea how it got localized or even made in the first place, but it's easily my favorite thing to watch now.",1399161600,,234,4.222222222222222
8320590,4,B001M6SHB0,"The show is good with hilarious jokes, but does not reach it's full potential at all. My main problem is that there are only 8 songs recycled throughout the 12 episodse, including the opening/closing theme. Those wishing for a varied soundtrack will have to look elsewhere. But looking at the bright side, every song has an unique style and will make you hum or sing together with them, either if it's on purpose or not. The lyrics are also always different even if the melody is the same. There are some episodes that falls flat, but fortunately, this only happens in two of the episodes. On the side of ""suggestive content"", the two first episodes ARE the worst of all. A highly suggestive masturbation joke in addition to a very detailed boner scene may make this an adult Anime for some. The rest of the episodes uses some suggestive sexual dialogue (very rarely though) instead, in addition to some strong male nudity in two episodes.

This show is great for those loving satire (Japanese satire which may be unheard of in the west), music and a hilarious and random story line. It is rated R for a reason though, and is a perfect addition to a mature Anime fan's video library",1365552000,,1182,4.601895734597156
8320591,5,B001M6SHB0,this is real nice and it saved me a ton cash on the price so if you're looking to save money go with this item.,1362614400,,111,3.48
8320592,5,B001M6SHB0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series when I saw it at a friends house, which is why when I heard its production is being discontinued I bought the series before they ran out.  I'm a big fan of musicals so I like this Nerima Daikon Brothers a lot.  Its fun, meta-aware of itself and has some catchy tunes.  They reuse the score for different songs but you'll be having so much fun you won't care.  Warning gags in the series have sex jokes or puns so this is not for kids but older teens or adults.  It is worth the price so buy a copy.

It is about two brothers and their cousin who dress like the Blues Brothers trying to get enough money to build a concert dome to perform where their diakon field is now.  They constantly get scammed by bad guys, get help from a rental guy white with an Afro who always has the right object to help them beat the crooks and steal their money, but they always lose it by the end of the episode.  Its fun and full of laughs.",1331510400,,955,4.096774193548387

8320594,2,B001M6SHB0,"Ok, I love shows like the wallflower and ouran highschool host club.  I saw this anime had descent to great reviews and with a great price and my love for anime comedies i figured why not.... Oh my Funimation should have saved the money saving this show.  I mean I'm ADD but this show was ridiculous.  I was trying to follow along with what was going on but by the middle of the series I didn't care anymore I just wanted it to be over.  And the musical part of it just made it worse, musical or not doesnt bother me, but with the over the top accents and obviously ment to be terrible singing, it made it hard to understand what anyone was saying lol! So even for background noise it was bit of an earsore.  It had its moments of comedy but it went way over the top going from slightly entertaining to annoying very quickly.  I tried giving this show a chance and watched it all the way through but just wasn't feeling it.  So for those of you who find annoying entertaining by all means have at it but I have enough annoyances in my life I have to deal with, so I'd rather not have to pay to be annoyed any further.  I just hope this review doesn't hurt my chances of selling this set on ebay :-S lol!",1323129600,,1203,4.111111111111111
8320595,4,B001M6SHB0,"This zany musical comedy anime from director Nabeshin (Watanabe Shinichi) doesn't attain
the heights of inspired lunacy reached by his exemplary EXCEL SAGA (What does?) but it's still a
pretty entertaining show. At the current price, it's a bargain, even if it's only 12 episodes
long. You have the choice of Japanese or English, and all of the songs in the English version
are in English. There's also a commentary track featuring Nabeshin and some voice actors.

The story concerns a group of daikon farmers who fantasize about being in a rock band and
building a stadium at which they can perform. Each episode finds them trying to come up with
ways to get money, mostly by stealing from shady businesses. As usual, Nabeshin himself is a
regular character. Here, he rents out devices that help the farmers in their efforts.

Toward the end of the series, there is a villainous character who is clearly based on the late
Michael Jackson, at whom the script pokes merciless fun. Though it was done before Jackson's
death, hardcore fans who believe that MJ could do no wrong are advised to beware!

Get this one if you like anime comedies, as the jokes fly at breakneck speed, though most of
the humor is decidedly adult-oriented. Nobody does this sort of thing like Nabeshin!",1292112000,4,1276,4.790909090909091
8320596,4,B001M6SHB0,"Ratings are a guesstimate, usually on the ""safe side"".

Sub-genre: Musical Comedy (Don't run, it's really good!)

Situations: Probably PG+  Hideki loves cousin Mako, Mako loves cousin Ichiro, Ichiro loves a panda bear...
Language:  Probably R
Nudity:  Probably PG  Not really any that's not entirely lacking in detail and colored spandex
  bodysuit
Violence:  PG  Cartoon Violence

Language options: Dub, Sub no Dub with subtitles. Usually I'd complain, but the translation required a lot of changes to get the jokes to work and I like the English version better (not being fluent in Japanese).

Special Features: Nothing worth mentioning. Except: There are commentaries under the languages menu (in Japanese) for some reason. Since I don't like commentaries, I had no problem with that.

First: I LOVED the English ending theme and in answer to it; You're welcome!

This is the story of 3 cousins that make up a blues/rock band (The Nerima Daikon Brothers) who are trying to get the money to build their own dome to perform in, as was their childhood dream. After getting ripped off at a paid audition (that was fake), they turn vigilante against con artists, swindlers, and bad-guys in general. But

they always manage to come out with less than they started with.
This series parodies the Blues Brothers and, more briefly, a lot of iconic American movies and shows as well as some Animes. I found it hilarious and it has become my favorite comedy Anime. What better can I say about it?",1287360000,4,1488,4.919678714859438
