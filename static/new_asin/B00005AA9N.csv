This movie is basically awesome on it's pwn, but if your a Lion's Den fan this movie is as good as it gets. It does have some matches that go to judges but is also has some submissions and Knockouts. It is a solid movie.",989971200,6,366,3.8289473684210527
8545822,5,B00005AA9N,"Great fights!!!!!!! Slot of seesaw type battles a very well matched card. Back & forth between most matches, all the Lion Den fighters' win in dramatic fashion. But, it didn't show the Kelly Dullanty vs. Duane ludwig fight which sucks.",988070400,,235,4.9
