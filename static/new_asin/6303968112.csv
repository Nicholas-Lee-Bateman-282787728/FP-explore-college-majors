7858903,5,6303968112,"This video puts us in the cockpit of the mighty Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet, via the probing cameras of ""Just Planes Videos"" (experts in aviation video programming since 1992).

This VHS program, produced in 1996, includes 3 takeoffs and a like number of landings on board Boeing 747-271C number ""LX-BCV"", a Jumbo operated by Cargolux Airlines (""Europe's All-Cargo Airline"").

With a run time of approximately 90 minutes, this exciting aviation program (which is labelled Volume 4 in JPV's ""Flight In The Cockpit"" series of videos), offers up the following highlights ............

>> Presentation of Cargolux (history of airline, its routes, and its fleet of aircraft).

>> Cockpit action (including checklists and pilot briefings).

>> Air-traffic Control communications.

>> An actual in-flight diversion (to Glasgow/Prestwick in Scotland) due to heavy fog in Keflavik, Iceland.

>> Night landing and takeoff at PIK (Prestwick).

>> Visit 4 airports, including two in the U.S.A. (JFK International in New York and DTW in Detroit). .... We also fly to Luxembourg, where Cargolux is based, as well as to Glasgow.

""Just Planes Videos"", also in 1996, released a second video featuring Cargolux (""Flight In The Cockpit #7""). That sixty-minute program shows the inner workings of the newer Boeing freighter -- the Boeing 747-400F. Cargolux, in fact, was the first airline in the world to operate that particular model of freighter aircraft, in 1993.

That 747-400F Cargolux video only offers up one flight (an 11-hour non-stop long-haul flight from Luxembourg to San Francisco), but it still provides some interesting aviation facts and info regarding the amazing B747. The plane's arrival at SFO (San Francisco International) is an ""automatic"" landing, due to thick Bay-Area fog.

""Flight In The Cockpit 7"" is also significant in that it shows the prototype B747-400 Freighter in action (registration number ""LX-ICV""; the 968th B747 ever built, and the first -400F model). The ""dedicated freighter"" version of the B747-400 differs in outward appearance from its sister variant (the B747-400 passenger aircraft) in one distinct and easily-recognizable way -- the Freighter version doesn't have the ""SUD"" (Stretched Upper Deck) that the passenger version possesses. The Freighter also incorporates a large, hinged cargo door in the nose of the airplane for easy off-loading of freight.

Cargolux has benefitted greatly since starting to operate the 747-400F on its long-range network. The airline has stated that the longer non-stop range of the Series-400F (4,400 nm) has saved the airline more than 300 refuelling stops per year, which equates to a monetary savings of about $15,000 per unneeded landing.

JPV's ""Flight In The Cockpit"" programs and newer ""World Air Routes"" series of VHS videos and Digital DVDs are a great way to visit a variety of different international airports, in a multitude of countries, while at the same time going ""behind the scenes"" right in the cockpit of many types of commercial aircraft, including the ever-popular 747, which is the type we climb aboard during this hour-and-a-half Cargolux program.

If you love everything about the fabulous Boeing 747, you might want to also check out the ""Polar Air Cargo"" DVD released by ""Just Planes"" on November 15, 2004. That 3-hour, 25-minute DVD is a beauty! It's a ""World Air Routes"" program that has something in common with this 1996 Cargolux VHS video, with the common denominators being the aircraft types featured (B747 Freighters) and two of the airports that can be seen on each of the programs (JFK and PIK).

The Polar Air DVD literally takes the viewer ""around the world"" in 205 minutes! The program begins with a New York-to-Atlanta flight and concludes with a Miami-to-New York leg. In between, Polar Air 747s fly us to the United Kingdom, Belgium, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil.

In all, that DVD takes us on board 10 flights to 9 cities in 6 different countries. The program even shows a ""go-around"" at Miami International Airport, when ATC instructs the Polar Air 747 to abort its landing due to a runway obstruction.

Save yourself the hassle of all those security checks at the airport -- just strap yourself into your living-room recliner and pop in a ""Just Planes"" video product. Short of being thrown back in your seat during takeoff (and the actual smell of the aviation jet fuel, which I personally love), a JPV flight is just about as good as being on board yourself.",1103500800,,4508,5.184573002754821
