6673178,5,B00NNUNPRE,I became a fan of anime after I watched this show years ago.  I haven't looked back since.  Great for people who love this genre :),1421712000,,131,4.0

6673180,3,B00NNUNPRE,"While watching the show in Japanese with headphones, I noticed during instances of dead air that there is a second audio track playing I n the background. It appears to be the same as the main audio track, but it is a few seconds ahead, causing distracting, out-of-sync background noise to be heard. At first I thought it was my headphones, but after watching other shows, playing video games and even switching to the English audio track, I've realized that the issues is with Viz's printing and not with my hardware. I really hope they fix this for future releases!",1421107200,4,567,4.68

6673183,5,B00NNUNPRE,"It's become quite clear that VIZ have taken good care of this show since the beginning of it's re-release earlier this year, as this set starts to bring the real meat of this beloved Takahashi work, I thought I'd talk more about the set itself as others will likely talk about the show in more detail.
It is of my belief that the images Amazon uses for the sets don't do them any justice; the sets look GORGEOUS in reality, a thick chipboard box with glossy gold print on it, it's also worthy of note that when stacked next to each other, the sets look flawless in my collection.

The Limited Edition in particular contains the episodes over three discs, some nice character cards and of course, the obligatory art book - however, the art book for this show in particular is magical for nostalgic purposes, a nice look at Ranma's beauty in the form of static drawings.

All in All , this set is going to look just as beautiful as the rest, and the sets individually are possibly the most consistent, best-looking volumes I've seen since '07.

Buy it, love it, never regret it.",1412467200,11,1076,4.479591836734694
6673184,5,B00NNUNPRE,Viz is doing and doing it well with these releases. They are already to the fourth set for the show and the year isn't even over yet. Anyway I can't wait to add another set to my dvd collection. I love this show and it always does it a good job at keeping me entertained.,1410998400,3,271,3.9454545454545453
