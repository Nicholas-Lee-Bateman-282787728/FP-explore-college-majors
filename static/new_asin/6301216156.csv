It reminds us how the purest principles of trust, generosity, kindness, tolerence, humanity, spirituality, friendship, and honor cross all  boundries of time, language, and religious barriers. An absolutely  beautiful, inspiring film to watch. I recommend this glorious life lesson  to all.",940204800,6,363,5.5636363636363635

324308,5,6301216156,"Not only does Babette's Feast relate to our epicurean senses, but our souls are drawn toward the search for fulfillment and resolution.  Martin and Philippa have denied the world what God rightly blessed them.  Spurred  on by a pious, yet selfish father, the two sisters give up their lives in  service for others.  Though this is fulfilling for both of them, they are  constantly drawn to a time when they could give as they were meant to.  Thus is the wonder of God.  He blesses any form of good.
A young french  chef comes to their door seeking shelter and employment.  The sisters learn  from Babette that giving is the ultimate goal of any artist, and that God  is truly the great weaver of all artists.
This movie is not for the  superficial or self centered.  You must be willing to delve into the  eternal to fully realized the implications of such a film.  Isaac Dennison  had a connection with the human soul when she wrote this text and Out of  Africa.  But even she knew what it was meant to be stiffled as an artist  (since her pen name was masculine, fearing loss of publication if she used  her real, femine name).
I watched this again last night and still find  new meanings and applications to life.  ""Give me leave to do my  utmost"" is the cry of the artist.  And aren't we all, all of us,  artists is our own right?",914371200,21,1334,4.386831275720165

324433,5,6301216156,"Barbette a refugee from another world, Babette Hersant (Stephane Audran), seeks a simple life as a cook in a simple village. Both she and the villagers learn from each other. As luck would have it Barbette wins the lottery. She decides to give back something to the simple people that took her into their society in the form of a feast. She gives more than they realize.

This film has a depth that allows everyone to acquire something of value from its viewing.

It is exceptionally beautiful from a cinematic level. The story on the surface is strait forward. There are many underlying meanings, some universal and others will be personal to the viewer.

However some people could interpret that Barbette was doing something weird. Some may think it was sacrilegious as some of the people of the village saw it. Others may see this as she was showing off. Still others that with all of her winnings she was cheap to just give them a meal.

The decision not to eat the stuff is played out in other movies as ""Theodora Goes Wild"" where they are not going to meet a train. Again in ""Chocolat"" they suspected an ulterior motive. But this movie is more moving when you find out the truth behind the gesture and the cost.",1503187200,,1217,4.54337899543379

""That is what the Scriptures mean when they say, 'No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.'""

The almost clever plots, with introductions of a few new characters and potential for interest, went nowhere. We don't even get to know Babette. Not really.

324559,5,6301216156,"Babette's Feast is one of the most loved films of the last few decades though it would probably not appeal to a wide audience. It is in Danish and French to begin with and it is as slowly paced as life itself must have been for those who lived in this small village on the west coast of Jutland. It lacks the usual conventions of the typical plot-driven film. There are no real villains, no big events or conflicts and the payoff for the long introduction is a group of older people sitting around eating dinner. Yet it's an extraordinary film. The plot has been presented in detail in many other reviews here so I won't repeat it here.

Everyone in the film has had a hard life and has had to make sacrifices that leave them wondering what might have been. This is most true with the three central characters. The two sisters each gave up a possibly happier life for the sake of their minister father and his austere Lutheran sect. Martine gave up the love of a young lieutenant and Filippa a possibly great career as a star on the operatic stage. Babette was the greatest chef at one of the most famed restaurants in Paris but had to spend her years in this small village preparing dried fish and bread soup and tending to a small cottage. After fourteen years have passed the congregation is down to seven older villagers who are quarrelsome and bitter. Babette's life is, at the very least, circumscribed after her life in Paris during the heyday of the Second Empire.

After winning a lottery, as thanks to those who took her in (and, I think, to show herself that she could still do it), Babette prepares an elaborate French dinner such as she might have made at the Cafe Anglais. The mere arrival of the ingredients sets the villagers ablaze with concern with the possible sinfulness of such a meal. But all goes well. Though the villagers could not even begin to comprehend the quality of the meal with which they are being presented, a recent arrival is there who can appreciate it, a very nice touch.

By the end of the feast the guests are full of forgiveness and love. Even the old carriage driver and the young kitchen-boy Eric are happy and content. The film works on many levels and must be experienced to fully appreciate it. it deservedly won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1988. I watch it every few years and this year showed it for guests after Thanksgiving dinner. It was wonderfully appropriate.",1480291200,22,2417,4.513698630136986
324560,5,6301216156,"As a morality play set in a stark, 19th century rural landscape, I suspect this won't appeal to those who demand Hollywood glitz.  However, this film has a beauty of its own. If you're willing to sit back and take it in, like you might a play, you will be richly rewarded.  The story operates on many levels.  Some have commented here that the message is somehow ""condescending"" to the simple, religious, folk portrayed here.  Quite the opposite - they are in fact a kind of prototype of any closed society, one which has come to believe it has a hold on truth, and which sees anything outside of its narrow world-view with extreme suspicion.  It's about how high-minded social groups over time can devolve into petty hatred when forces of social cohesion are loosened and the underlying meaning of their ideals are lost.  It's about the meaning of gratitude and selflessness, and about how we don't gain anything by denying ourselves occasional pleasure.  Wonderfully acted, with a stellar cast, it's a perfect film to discuss later over rum cakes and coffee.",1479945600,,1060,4.791208791208791

The story itself is, however, unnecessarily condescending to common people who act as foils for Babette and her feast. The plot, about two sisters in a small fundamentalist  sect in rural Denmark 150 years ago, starts off nicely enough. Then a couple improbably plot twists bring in, one at a time, several sophisticates who try, over many years, to ""enlighten"" the sisters. It's good for some laughs, put ultimately the primary emotion the movie tries elicit towards the sisters is pity. If you are feeling snarky, this movie is for you.",1463788800,,624,5.058252427184466

As the energy of the founder of the faith group dissipates many years after his death, it the energy of an exile that brings new life to the daughters of the founder in their efforts at Christian service. When the group falls into gossip, accusation and begins to disintegrate, the stranger, an exile whose husband and son are executed in a failed revolution in Paris, through her artistry as a famed chef of a famous Parisian restaurant revitalizes the Christian service of the sisters. But only in the winning of a lottery does her artistry and personal reconciliation create a truly wonderful meal that rekindles --- no, no rekindling here -- sheer transformation of life -- including the life of the General who was instrumental in the death of the chef's husband and son. Unfortunately the movie fails to inform us of this part in the execution -- only the story itself carries that detail. In an area of hopelessness and drab existence, the transformation of the lives of many is completed.

Directed by Gabriel Axel.

Near the Jutland coast of Denmark live two old Puritan sisters, Martine (Birgitte Federspiel) and Filippa (Bodil Kjer). On this day, they are serving the congregation of disciples in the minister's house.
  The story takes us to a younger time when Martine (Vibeke Hastrup) and Filippa (Hanne Stensgaard) took care of their father, the pastor. They would earn their income by serving dinner to the guests who have stopped by during their travels.
  Lorens Lowenhielm (Gudmar Kloving) is a cavalry officer  transferred to the Jutland coast. When he arrives to the pastor's house, he meets Martine and has a liking to her. After many visits to the house, nothing develops that we can see. The  The day comes when Lorens tells Martine he must leave and can not return.
  At his residence with the other officers, while the other guys talk about the females they are courting, Lorens chooses not to talk about his time with Martine. Instead, he decides to forget her. He ends up getting married to a lady-in-waiting to Queen Sophia.
  Achille Papin (Jean-Philippe LaFont) is an opera singer. When his career becomes dry, he accepts the offer to go to the Pastor's home to teach Filippa how to sing.  She has a wonderful singing voice. Papin had hopes for Filippa, but she chose not to continue the lessons with him and so the pastor sends him back to Paris, France.
  Now 35 years have gone by, Martine and Filippa still live in the same residence. It is a rainy night in September 1871. A weak, mysterious lady appears at the door. She is Babette Hersant (Stephane Audran) who has been sent by Achille Papin from Paris. Babette becomes the new servant for the ladies. Babette has a secret of her own.

 This movie is about how one life touches another person's life and somehow it all comes together again.

This is not an epic film, but a short story.

Also in the cast: Bibi Andersson, Erik Petersen, Jarl Kulle. Singing voice provided by Tina Kiberg.

Filmed in Jylland, Sjaelland and Copenhagen, Denmark.

Option of Language: English French/Dansk, Spanish.
Option of Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.

Theatrical trailer included.

The English language and what the English subtitles present are at times different.

I did not care for the food that was served during the feast, but the different wines looked delicious.

This is His Holiness Pope Francis favorite film.

324649,4,6301216156,"I found it fascinating to see God at work here.  For example, apparently the original book had Babette in the town for 12 years before she cooked the feast.  The movie producer changed it to 14 to represent the 14 stations of the cross.  The meal Babette served had 12 guests, the number at the Last Supper with Jesus.  There is also an example of forgiveness.  The general at the table was the leader of a revolution who killed Babette's husband and son.  Many other examples if one sees the movie in that light.  Otherwise, it is interesting to see how people lived in that era.  A pastor at the discussion afterward said a woman in his church, who is from Denmark, said all school children are required to view the movie because it gives a glimpse of what life was like in the late 18th century.",1447372800,,798,4.380952380952381

324673,5,6301216156,"A true gem of a film, a genuine love feast.  Karen Blixen describes what may be the deepest struggle of the human heart, our choice between God and the beautiful things of this world that He has created.  Practically we all make tradeoffs between the ideal and the reality, and as we age, we face the consequences of our choices and ask ourselves if we have taken the right path.  We all choose between the ideal and actual calling, lover, spirituality, and so on.

I have started on one path in my 20's, and more than a decade later, I wonder if this is the right choice but resolutely continue, trusting that while the present things of this world are good, only eternity will truly satisfy me.  I wonder what this will cost me in my present life.  However, Babette's Feast reminds me that for those who trust in God, He will give to them an abundance of what they have chosen, and even restore to them what they have forsaken to pursue their first love.  Yes, one can have one's cake and eat it too.  That cake is Babette's delicious meal, and even more deeply, the blood and body of Christ.  In the word's of the General, ""Grace comes with no preconditions.  We need only to hope, and receive.""

I recommend this movie even to a secular audience.  At the very least, Babette pursues her art, and gives lavishly for the sake of her diners' spiritual transformation.",1438732800,3,1368,4.471774193548387

Though her massive lottery winnings could have taken her away from the austere, fundamentalist village, she gave ALL THAT SHE HAD to create the best culinary masterpiece possible as a gift of thanks to the villagers.  The irony of it all is that only one man could even express the magnitude of the feast and gratitude for it - the military man.  He had to say it all FOR the dinner guests.  Babette KNEW that the religious people would not be able to comment, but she also KNEW that her creation would astound them, like Disney World on a fork.  Only the military man could express it for them, and she was happy with that.  She gave her all.  She gave her best.

What is especially appealing is the ascetics of the life the main characters lead versus the Feast that Babette ultimately prepares for them.  How even in the presence of the world's most celebrated chef, the islanders have no clue the feast which has been laid out for them.  Only the General, who knew of Babette during his time in Paris, truly appreciates the meal.  The subtle intertwining of lives, the choices made and ultimately regretted make this movie a tapestry of emotions.  The rawness of the land is the canvas backdrop by which the director brings to full flavor the richness of the feast....I think I'll go watch it again!",1426982400,4,722,4.698412698412699

If I were in charge of casting however, I would have switched the roles of the two sisters as Bodil Kjer looks more like the younger version of Martine and vise versa.

324794,5,6301216156,"Its September 1871 in a remote part of Jutland in Denmark  and on a rain-sodden night - a young French woman dressed in hooded garb knocks on the door of elderly sisters Martine and Filippa. The serenely beautiful ladies live frugally and quietly in tiny houses high above the cliffs in a deeply Christian Community  generously feeding the elderly of the flock every single day with hot food culled from their basic cooking skills.

The woman is Babette Hersant  once a worshipped culinary chef in Caf Anglais in Paris - and she bears a letter from an elderly French Opera Singer called Achille Papin. He has sent Babette to Denmark by boat to escape political rioting in the capitol city that has robbed her of everything including a husband. Papin visited the sisters when they were youthful beauties many decades back  and lost his heart to Filippas angelic voice (words from a duet they sing in a clinch together titles this review). But because of fear and entrenched Christian beliefs  Filippa could not bear what their burgeoning love was doing to her soul  so she had her Pastor father send him away (and silence his singing). But Papin remembered her kindness too  so he has sent the broken Babette into their care.

14 years pass and Babette has now worked her way into the hearts of the kindly sisters, the local grocer and even the fishermen who cant pass off rancid meat or old fish on the food-knowledgeable Babette.  She even knows where the herbs are on the wild grass stretches that overlook the Sea.

Babettes only link with France is a lottery ticket a kind relative keeps renewing for her year after year. And one day she gets a letter  shes won 10,000 Francs. To their astonishment Babette doesnt want to squander the money on clothes or fine things  but instead payback their kindness by cooking the austere community a proper French Dinner in honour of their Pastor Father whose anniversary is approaching. And Babette wants to do it her way. The sisters agree but have no idea of the opulence that is going to invade their linen-covered table and remain tearfully terrified of its corruptive nature. But great wine, champagne, real turtle soup, sumptuous cooking and divine food mellow the bickering and tetchy elderly community and bring about a deep healing  even a spiritual renaissance of sorts

Released in the summer of 1987 and directed by Gabriel Axel (a Danish language movie with English subtitles)  the film is based on a story by Karen Blixen (aka Isak Dinesen) and its full title is ""Karen Blixen's Babette's Gaestebud"". It was Denmarks first Oscar Win for a foreign language film (also took the BAFTA).

Special mention should be made of the 'young' sisters whose back-story of 'lost love' gives the film its beating heart. A dashing Hussar called Lorens Lowenhielm is stationed in a Garrison Town living a life of tedium and gambling. His father feels he needs to be 'sent away'  so ships the blue-uniformed young man off to his aunt in Norre Vosburg in Jutland. One afternoon out of horseback he sees his redemption from creditor notes and parental lectures  the beautiful young Martine. He immediately tries to woe both her and the pious community who surrender her at every moment  but soon becomes painfully aware that his needs for luxury and easy living far outweigh his needs for Martine. So Lorens leaves and marries a countess with wealth and position. But he has of course made the mistake of a lifetime.

Now an old man but still a dashing officer  he is invited to the feast  and recognizes the extraordinary cooking skills from a past encounter in Paris (like a warm glow from the past). But more than that  he fills old Martines heart with joy by telling her that he has always loved her  and not even the physicality of years or body will keep them apart spiritually (his declaration of love to her at the end is one of the loveliest pieces of dialogue in cinema).

I wish I could say the Artificial Eye BLU RAY is a triumph  far from it. Despite its BFI logo  the print has specs of dirt on it, lines showing on occasion and a fair amount of natural fuzzy grain. It does look cleaned up in some places  beautiful even  but the BLU RAY improvement is slight. Its defaulted to 1.85:1 so fills the entire screen but theres no getting away from the fact that its good rather than great  which given the sumptuous nature of the feast  is so disappointing (docked a star for that).  As I say  it does look shockingly clean in places  but anyone expecting frame-by-frame clean up can look elsewhere.

There is a short interview in French with Stephane Audran who is intensely proud of the masterpiece and Subtitles are Danish, Swedish, French and English.

""Babette's Feast"" is a gentle film  slow and even pious to a point of being farcical. But the good-humour and warmth will etch its way into your heart  and after you witness the feast  be prepared to raid the cookie jars in your kitchen with a passion.

As young Papin's heart soars and he tells young Filippa she has 'the voice of joy'  there are moments in ""Babette's Feast"" when you are in complete lip-smacking agreement with the rotund Frenchman. A beautiful life-affirming film and then some",1397001600,2,5202,4.683920704845815
324795,4,6301216156,"This movie was recommended to me by a friend because we both love cooking. The movie is really not about cooking, except that Babette is an outstanding cook.
I gave the movie a four-star rating because of the interesting, indirect commentary on the impact of isolation, and religious faith on the lives of people.
I would recommend this movie to those who are interested in observing the impact of cultural differences upon the fears of people with rather primitive belief systems.
What I liked most is that Babette does not defend herself against false beliefs about her, but lets her patience and skill speak for itself.",1396742400,,622,4.877358490566038

But Gabriel Axels 1987 Danish film Babettes Feast is more than a flick about French dinners and conservative preachersbased on the Karen Blixen story of the same name, the film is an exploration of the spiritual and physical choices one makes in life, and the role art plays in those choices.

And it's absolutely fantastic. You'll be hard pressed to find better acting or a more thought-provoking plot. This little gem is a true masterpiece of cinema--if you have the chance to view it, you won't regret it.

Babette had been a restaurant owner and its' chef and when she gives back to the sisters and the village it is through her skills.  But when she prepares the feast she enlists the help of a local, very young boy who has never even seen an expensive Parisienne restaurant.  Babette instructs him in food prep and serving in the dining room.  He accepts his role with complete absorption and Babette is so confident in him, she never enters the dining room.  The most perfect grasp of what they have accomplished is told in the scene after the feast and Babette and the boy sit together outside the kitchen.  Not a word is spoken but it is a perfect depiction of satisfaction that an artist knows after accomplishing perfection.
Another detail of the movie is Babette's dress.  She wears the same dress throughout and it is always perfect for every scene.  The dress was designed by Karl Lagerfeld and a masterpiece.  Just another contribution towards a perfect movie.",1380067200,2,1058,4.737704918032787

324992,5,6301216156,"Stunning in taking strikingly common human actions and allowing them to become a rich reflection on what life is meant to be. For many, they will grasp the face of this movie and the relationships that are flawed, misused, even perverted from what was intended to cause good. Yet, the feast speaks of a willingness to share in lives that can be moved from soup to tasting (finally) what is the dessert, what is not the starter but the richness of what is life beyond our understanding and experience.

The feast is not about the meal we see, but about the meal we do not use which offers ""mercy and truth"" ""where righteousness and bliss kiss one another;"" where fullness of love given in God is recognized by people. Undoubtedly, those who only taste the common may misunderstand, but the movie serves also as invitation to share in fuller relationships premised on God's first offer of love. It draws the viewer to ask if they have yet sat at a table where they see their lives drowned in wondrous dishes they have not tasted before, drink which is exceptional, and giving that transformational. That is a meal worth eating... and seeking.

It is not a film that can or should be watched once or the subtle aspects of irony and comedy may be diminished by the larger story that is indeed only known completely by a meal that makes the stars draw a little nearer.",1354320000,,1363,4.559183673469388

324996,5,6301216156,"This Blu-Ray version from Australia (for all regions A/B/C) is good and worthwhile for folks who like the movie and want the best copy currently available (through Amazon US at least):

1. The movie is in the original Danish with American English subtitles. Subtitles cannot be turned off as far as I can tell (no menu options for language or subtitles). If their are no options then this is the best default for American audiences since you can hear the original acting and read the translation. If you speak Danish you might be frustrated that you cannot turn off the subtitles.

2. The subtitles are very crisp--a big improvement over the DVD which has jagged subtitles. The subtitle translation appears to be the same as the DVD version.

3. The sound quality is noticeably better than the DVD. I don't know whether it could be improved further or is using the highest quality Blu-Ray audio, but I have a very good stereo and it's a very apparent improvement.

4. The Blu-ray transfer appears to be good. It's not inherently a crisp and hyper-detailed movie. This transfer appears to capture all of the detail available--the film grain is just visible but not a distraction. It's consistent with seeing the original film projected in a theater. It's possible that future transfers could be a little sharper and cleaner, but there are no evident problems with this one (other than a couple of dust specks and a brief line on the opening title screen).

5. The film fills my HDTV screen. The DVD, although upsampled to 1080 by my Blu-ray player (Oppo BDP-93), was letterboxed on all sides. So with the Blu-ray I get more detail and the image fills the screen.

Overall it's the best version that we can buy in the US (as far as I can tell, as of August 2012). Four stars for the Blu-Ray and five stars for the film.

I hope that a new US Blu-ray comes out with perhaps an improved transfer, the option to have different subtitles (or turn them off), and perhaps some extras. The only extra on this Blu-ray version is a trailer for the film.",1345593600,11,2042,4.6088154269972454

325043,5,6301216156,"I find this film remarkable for its wonderful depictions of two Danish sisters, their father, their French cook, Babette, and their fellow villagers.

The piety, humbleness, religious observance, hard work, and discipline shown especially by the two Danish sisters are an amazing testament to true religious faith and practice.  Now only is it preached, they truly practice it, (to the best of their ability).  They obey both their father on earth and their Father in heaven.

Babette is inspiring as one who seeks refuge with the two sisters who provide a place for her to live in their small village in Denmark.  She is an immigrant fleeing the horrors of war-torn France. She works hard, is humble, shows consideration for others by paying due respect to her new people, and demonstrates her regard of her new land by observing the rules of the village and of the State.  She gracefully and dutifully accepts her role as cook and servant for the sisters.  She stays single, with neither husband nor child nor family.  She actually gives up her life to care for the two sisters and the villagers.  Her speech is tempered, considerate, modest, accepting, and quiet.  She actually cares about her new Danish neighbors and folk.  So when she wins the lottery, she doesn't spend the money on herself or return to France, she uses the money for a more altruistic purpose.

By quietly exploring the modest lives of these villagers and their ""new"" guest, ""Babette's Feast"" has a loud and strong religious message for us to hear, see, and understand.  It is like a pithy rule or commandment that has been fleshed out by the actors into a most remarkable film.

I mark this film as the one milestone to judge all other Danish films.  No other Danish films that I have seen compares to the spiritual purity of this one.",1314576000,2,1811,4.759615384615385
325044,4,6301216156,"A tale of passions and art thwarted and brought to life, with lovely photography, and solid performances.

The charming story of two spinster sisters in a dour, religious Danish town who take in a French political refugee. After years of working for these women, with gratitude and gentleness, but little expressed emotion, the woman (Stephane Audran) uses lottery money she wins not to return to France, or to start her own life, but to create a feast, bringing back her own lost artistry as one of France's great chefs.

In spite of their promise not to get swept up in the food, the locals slowly succumb to it's sublime mix of the sacred and the sensual.

All of this is sweet, interesting, entertaining and well told, but for me there's also something a tiny bit thin about it. It feels like a short story stretched to feature length (which it is), and I didn't find it quite as moving emotionally as I wished. Many like it more than me, but to me it's a lovely, well-told, worthwhile film, but not quite a great one.",1312156800,,1022,4.543478260869565
325045,5,6301216156,"Who would think that the story of a female Parisian chef living in exile in Danish rural Jutland following the Franco-Prussian War could be interesting?  I would never have chosen such a theme as the basis of a movie or novel!  But this brilliant movie makes a great story of the cultured and good-hearted French woman living with the aging spinster daughters of the late pastor of a strict religious sect.  Working for these two kind ladies as a servant, the Parisian Babbette is assigned the preparation of a simple bread and beer soup as her first task--and over time we learn even to that she brings excellence.  Finally, years later, when she wins a lottery in France, the chef decides to spend the money to prepare a meal for her Danish friends that is the epitome of French haute cuisine.

On the way to this meal we learn the background of these characters--that the sisters could have chosen lives much more marked by nominal success than living together in a rural village in a thatched-roof cottage.  One could have married a dashing young officer who had been billeted in their village as a sort of punishment for his rake-like habits.  The other had been discovered by a visiting Frenchman and found to be an amazing singer; she could have left Jutland and become the toast of the continent.  Regarding the former rake and erstwhile suitor, we learn of his story as well--and how what he gleaned from these simple people put him on the road to great success and status in the Danish military.

The meal prepared by the French chef Babette becomes more than a meal.  By chance the successful military man ends up attending the feast, where he exchanges smiles with the woman he once courted, and reflects on his life.  My favorite scene is one such recollection--that of his life immediately after his assignment in Jutland--and of a gathering of Danish royalty in which he wins their favor by citing the religious maxims he learned in Jutland--while dancing to a chamber orchestra playing the Brahms waltz (Opus 39 No. 15) that I have loved ever since those days when I would listen to my mother play it on the piano.",1311379200,3,2130,4.668449197860962

325085,3,6301216156,"Based on a Karen Blixen story, BABETTE'S FEAST is a heartwarming tale of generosity in 19th century Denmark. As the film opens, we are introduced to Martine and Philippa, daughters of a charismatic preacher in a tiny Jutland village. Dedicated to their father's work, they turn down the courtship of a Danish officer and a French musician. Decades later, the musician sends them Babette, a refugee from the destruction of the Paris Commune, in the hope that the sisters can shelter her and employ her as a maid. When she wins an annual lottery, Babette decides to put on a feast for her employers, but no one expects the depths of selflessness she goes to.

BABETTE'S FEAST is entertaining enough, and it gives an idea of just how dull and messy life in Jutland was at this time. The details of the feast will make you salivate and dust off the French cookbook, and certainly the ending will make you say ""Aww"" in spite of how clumsily it's put on film. Otherwise the acting isn't too revelatory, and the humour is pretty basic (the same joke is even used twice).

325092,5,6301216156,"I saw BABETTE'S FEAST many years ago at a foreign film festival in Washington DC.  This classic film, which was based on a short story written by Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen will always remain indelibly memorable.  I've seen the movie several times, and each time I come away with a deeper philosophical appreciation for the absolute beauty and poignancy of the storyline.  Indeed, BABETTE'S FEAST is actually a repertoire of sorts; offering a powerful message about charity and selflessness, duty and honor, pride and humility, regret and sorrow, faith and forgiveness, and love  and redemption.

Two humble spinster sisters who live in a small coastal town in Denmark take in a woman who flees France to escape peril during the French Revolution. The sisters, Martina and Philippa were beautiful young women in their youth, and each gave up the chance for love from suitors - one a young cavalry officer, and one a famous French singer - and chose to remain loyal to their father.  They lived the remainder of their lives in quiet surrender, servitude and sacrifice to carry on the deeply religious teachings of their deceased father who was considered the leader of their devout small religious sect.  However, many decades later when Babette becomes part of the sisters household, subtle changes take place, which causes ambivalent feelings for Martina and Philippa.

Sixteen years past quickly, when Babette wins a lottery and asks the sisters if she can prepare a genuine French meal for the 100th anniversary celebration dinner honoring the birth of their late father.  After giving their permission, Martina and Philippa are perplexed by Babette's extravagance and the items she has shipped from France to use in preparation for the meal.  Now horrified, the sisters become haunted by fears that decadence will descend upon them and their small religious sect.  Yet, they can not go back on their promise to allow Babette to prepare this important meal.  All the followers of the sister's religious sect are invited, and all have feelings of deep apprehension.

The evening finally arrives, and the small sect join hands in prayer and vow that they will resist whatever beguiling temptations might seduce them to sin.  The announcement for dinner is called.  But instead of fear, as the meal is served the mood is soon changed to that of suspended awe.  Indeed, the grand 'feast' that Babette prepares, becomes both a startling revelation and a powerful redemption for all who attend ... including the high ranking officer who was once the suitor of Martina.

I disagree with those who categorize this movie as a Christian message.  Rather, it's a story with a philosophical message that examines timeless issues about man's search for meaning, purpose, and ... salvation.

If you've not done so already, I recommend that you include BABETTE'S FEAST in your DVD collection.

As this is a subtitled movie (if you are English-speaking), you have to make sure you can pay full attention to the whole film. If you can, you are in for a treat. The whole story is so simple that it could be described in about three sentences--yet it somehow grips you. There is a suspense and anticipation that builds towards the inevitable(?) resolution.

Truly, while this story does revolve around a feast (and food), it is so much more than that, and that's what I've misunderstood. I thought, ""How good can a movie *about* food be?"" But it's a movie about a simple people who are able to draw close because of a special meal.

325223,5,6301216156,"Babette's Feast is by Danish director Gabriel Axel, and tells the story of a French woman named Babette (played by Stephane Audran) who shows up one night on the doorstep of two spinster sisters living in far away Jutland toward the end of the 19th century. Since the passing of their revered pastor father, it is all the two women can do to keep his bickering flock together. They agree to take in Babette and make her their housekeeper, and for twenty years she serves them faithfully. Then one day she surprises the sisters by announcing that she has won the French national lottery: 10,000 francs. To show her gratitude to them, and to celebrate the upcoming anniversary of their father's passing, Babette asks to be allowed to prepare a real French meal for the sisters and their guests. They agree, and she sends away to France for the ingredients.

When Babette's nephew returns with all the preparations for the meal, the plain people of the town, who have never seen such things as sea turtles and quails, suspect that she's a witch, and decide they will make no comments about the food during the meal, lest they enjoy it and become bewitched. The night of the feast is spectacular. Never have any of them tasted such divinity. One of the guests, a General who once courted one of the sisters and is still in love with her, comments about how the food tastes just like the delicacies he once enjoyed at a very famous Parisian restaurant which boasted a lady chef. Miraculously, Babette's feast heals all wounds among the pastor's congregation, and confirms the love the General has always harbored for the sister, and she for him. A very beautiful scene is the congregation outside after the feast with hands joined in a circle, singing under the stars.

Afterwards, the two sisters comment that they suppose Babette will now return to France. ""I have no one there anymore,"" she tells them. ""Besides, I have no money to return."" ""But the 10,000 francs you won!"" they contend. Then Babette confesses that she was the famous female chef to which the General eluded, and that a meal at her restaurant for that number of people would have cost exactly 10,000 francs. This is a wonderful, beautiful film that is an allegory of the Lord's Supper, and an example of God's grace and love. If you like food, you will love every delicious detail of the feast. The film is subtitled for English, but also includes a dubbed version which I would not recommend because I think the film loses much through it. Endure the subtitles - it will be worth it. Babette's Feast, which is based on a novel by Karen Blixen, won a well-deserved Oscar for Best Foreign Film, plus ten other awards.",1238457600,7,2681,4.665961945031713
325224,5,6301216156,"All I can say is ""wow"".  Others have recounted the story here, and it is a rather simple one, but the way that the movie comes together is much more than the sum of its parts.

The elderly sisters, Phillipe and Martina, iconically named after the Protestant reformers Martin Luther and Phillip Melchthon, are two pious spinsters who have tried to do everything they can to remain faithful to the legacy of their preacher-father, and that of their deep faith.  In doing so, they have rejected the riches of the world, have chosen to consider romantic love as nothing more than of 'slight importance', and subsist on a thin, nasty 'ale bread' gruel.  Not unlike their namesakes, they represent everything that is, for lack of a better expression, 'puritan'-- I would say even, 'anti-sacramental'.

Into their lives, seemingly randomly, a mysterious refugee from France (in the time of the Revolution), arrives at the ladies' house and serves as a domestic worker for little more, it seems, than room and board.  She comes into 10,000F from the lottery, and in thanksgiving to the ladies who sheltered her for some 14 years after her arrival, she desires to serve them a real French feast.  The women, who do not know anything other than their modest village accede to her proposal, and almost instantly come to fear what they are about to encounter as they see the foreign produce and wine and the big, scary turtle which are brought in... not to mention their fear in having an encounter with the romantic 'ghosts' of their past.  The ladies and the townspeople, in fear of offending the austere sensibilies of the old, long-gone pastor in whose honor the meal is served, form a pious compact among themselves that, in their lack of concern for the splendors of the world, they will politely eat, but not 'taste' what they are eating.

The preparation and serving of the feast becomes the focus of the last half of the movie, where the villagers and the women come to 'see' their worlds differently by way of this 'otherworldly' meal... loves left behind, old sins pardoned, fulfillment of the words of scripture and of the ladies' father.  The Eucharistic overtones of the banquet are unmistakable, bringing a new and different life to a poor and perhaps even undeserving people who did not and perhaps still do not know any better.  They cannot help but 'taste' the meal and be drawn into its power to resolve the past fears such a meal represents (such as the inevitable encounter with old loves, the worldly splendor of the meal itself, or perhaps an encounter with the 'turtle from hell').

In serving the meal and exhausting her fortune, Babette herself finds fulfillment-or perhaps redemption-as a frustrated artist who has for one final time in her life fulfilled her (""priestly""?) calling, not simply to make people happy or to entertain them, but to come to the full self-realization of who she is as a world-class French chef.  It is a moment of 'transfiguration' if you will, not just for her, but for her guests within the confines of this particular time and place and situation when the meal is served.  The spinster sisters--even in their world which no doubt will return to austere puritanism and mean gruel the next day--are forever changed.  At the same time they are touched and even affirmed in their faith by this encounter.  Again, the sacrificial, Eucharistic, and sacramental overtones are unmistakable and an essential part of understanding this movie's message and depth.

On the technical side, the DVD is decent for what it is.  No, it's not 1080p with digital surround, but it is a decent transfer for an older foreign film which is subtitled and has an English dub-track.  I don't know Danish at all, but I can tell that the French translations, both in the subs and the dubs impoverish the story somewhat... but what can one do?  To appreciate this movie, one needs to put the first half hour in perspective and not get lost in it.  It is slow, but it is important development to understand the providence of Babette's arrival.  At moments the story seems slow, but there is plenty of room to take in what is going on and consider it on multiple levels... to savor it like the character of the general sipping the fine wine... rather than gulp it down like some of the townspeople who may never even appreciate what they are enjoying.

I came across this movie thanks to a brief gloss on it in a recent talk by Fr. Robert Barron... he has a number of books on Amazon.  I don't know if he has commented on this movie or not in anything he as published, as I am way behind in my reading at the moment.",1236556800,5,4630,4.687654320987654

325230,4,6301216156,"Out of boredom,I was changing from channel to channel when I tuned in to the MGM cinema and saw this scene, an austere but beautiful young woman was being taught a French song by an amorous French voice coach. The woman's voice was heavenly, the setting was in an drab cottage. It gripped my attention and I saw the whole film without knowing what it was. At the end credits, the principal actress was identified, Stephanie Audran, and the costumes were by Karl Lagerfield, so I realized that it must have been a big production rather than a never heard and forever obscure movie.
The story goes on to the young woman's delicately refusing the overtures of the coach and his advise for her to go to Paris to be the opera sensation of the city. For such a heavenly voice, it would have been logical that she accepts, but she goes to her father and sister and tells them that she wants to discontinue her studies. She is deeply commited to her religion and life in the bleak village.
After, a young French woman arives, with a letter of introduction from her former vocal coach, it is Babette and she is fleeing disturbances in France. She is willing to work as the cook sans wages for the 2 sisters, whose father, the Protestant minister has already died. She is accepted by the 2 spinsters and taught how to cook simple Nordic dishes. She is shown how to pick a dried fish from a rack, salt it, immerse it in water and boil it. Babette's face is inscrutable. Next, she is shown how to prepare the bread to thicken the soup by breaking stale pieces and boiling them in broth.
The next scene is 14 years after, and Babette hasn't aged, though the sisters have-placidly, I suppose due to their religious peace while Babette's preservation is due to her French style. Babette receives a notice that she has won a lottery in Paris and before she goes back, she asks the sisters if she could prepare a French dinner for the small community. At this time, the community is rife with strife, the usual small town bickerings. It would be Main st. if they didn't speak in Danish. The sisters are helpless in guiding them.
Babette comes back with crystals and porcelain, quails and a live turtle, herbs and sugar. The sisters are shocked, such extravagance for the senses can only be the devil's work. They tell the community about their fears and ask them, for Babette's sake to partake but to be silent. A social star, a retired Swedish general is accidentally invited. In this case, he is the food and wine critic of the movie. Babette is continuosly in the kitchen slaving for the guests who are bewildered by the dishes served. The general is amazed and when the quail comes pronounces it as something he tasted in the Cafe Anglais in Paris and was created by a woman chef. The dish's title, quail in a sarcophagus. Slowly, the congregation appreciates the feast and are warmed by the wine, amontillado, champagne. When the meal ends, the general is romantically nostalgic and the querulous congregation files out in harmony and beatifically.
Babette confesses that she can no longer go back to Paris for she has spent all her winnings for the feast. A dinner for 12 at the Cafe Anglais is 10,000 francs. She is the former chef. And so she remains, a drudge in a bleak Scandinavian village.
I though that it must have been taken from a short story by Guy de Maupassant. The simple tale, the bitter sweet ending. Weren't they all foolishness? The woman with the heavenly voice, wasted in the sarchopagus of the village, Babette forever toiling to a routine and preparing boiled fish.",1227139200,2,3576,4.5890625

Some people can't keep up with the slow start to the story, but when telling a good story it's not always necessary to jump right to the exciting part.  You draw it out.  Like cooking, storytelling is a craft that's quickly losing it's place in public eye.  Both have been replaced by getting spoon-fed homogenous crap from a can.

At the end of the movie, when the sisters realize that Babette had given all of her money to prepare the meal, I identified with her, I felt a solidarity with her.  She did it to feel like a human being again.  There's such love.  I only hope that someday I might perform like that.  I've always looked at cooking as performance-art.  My older sister is a singer, and I have a love for music, but my medium has always been in food, in feeding people and making it special.  When I prepare meals for my family and friends, or as of late the students at school, I can sometimes hear an orchestra tuning up in my head.  A feeling of ""yes, now, begin"".  I got a sense of that from the movie, too.  The spiritual experience of getting ready to prepare a wonderful meal, the care and patience that it takes.

I especially liked that the carriage-driver got to take part in the feast, too :-)  In my current place in life as a lowly kitchen-rat, I appreciate that everyone gets fed.

There is unexpected comedy throughout the movie as well, that often goes overlooked.  The villagers' shocked reactions, fearing for their very souls at the ""witches' sabbath"", futilly determined not to enjoy the meal. The dream sequence is nicely shot, and funny.  Then to see one of the old ladies take a sip of water and then switch back to the wine.  It brings a smile to my face every time.

Babette's Feast, 1987 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film, starts off painfully slowly. While the movie does get quite good after that, I have to wonder whether the Academy simply fast-forwarded through the first half-hour of their screeners when deciding to give the award to this rather than, say, Au Revoir les Enfants. (But then, it was the eighties, when the Academy were collectively demented; anything was possible. I mean, come on, Reds won Best Pitcure.) I suggest you do the same, and stop when you finally meet Babette (Stephane Audran). Everything before that is setup, and it's not especially well-handled setup. In fact, it's not really handled at all. But then expatriate Babette wins the French lottery, and everything starts getting fun.

From there, the movie is a foodie's dream. It's like an episode of Iron Chef where there's only one competitor, a blaze of buying, cooking, serving, eating, all of which takes subtle digs at the conventions of the time (which are obvious during the scenes; you don't need the setup for anything other than knowing who's at the table). Wonderful. In other words, watch the last hour of the film and be entertained.

325281,5,6301216156,"I had heard good things about ""Babette's Feast"" and I had seen a couple of ""food"" movies to prepare me for it.  It seems an odd genre; food films.  However, I've discovered that they have a unique effect on me.  While following an interesting story, I become engrossed in the variety of entres and appetizers resulting in a multi-dimensional experience.  I've found it best not to watch such movies on an empty stomach.

""Babette's Feast"" tells the story of a couple of exceptional spinster sisters and their fulfilling lives of service to others.  We get to know their father; a forceful preacher who believes that the road to salvation lies in self-denial.  We see the sisters both having romantic opportunities in their younger days and we're never quite certain if they harbor regrets in their later years.  In the midst of their structured lives comes a French woman in need of a sort of mental asylum.  She becomes their servant with her pay rendered in the form of room and board.  She is instructed in the preparation of the local dishes which seem to be just the opposite of her culinary abilities.  Eventually, she comes into money (there is an obvious clue to the source that we just end up waiting to happen).  Her wish is to be able to prepare a 5 star French meal.  The humor in this is that it is for the sister's fellow worshippers; those who deny themselves the luxuries of the material world.

All this may not seem like such a great plot but it is the character development that reaches out and involves us intimately in the movie.  We are left with the observation that an artist is always in search of perfection.  The duality of how perfection is perceived ends up being both exclusive and inclusive.  Well, you had to be there.

325334,5,6301216156,"""Babette's Feast"" is definitely one of the best movies I have seen. It combines excellent characterization, cerebral dialogue, and beautiful cinematography to create a masterpiece. All of the subplots come together at the end for a satisfying conclusion.

The movie opens with a voice-over narrator telling about Martina and Phillipa (named after Martin Luther and Philip Melancthon), the daughters of a deceased Protestant minister. They live in a small community on the Danish coast of Jutland in the 1830s. The late minister founded a sect of his own, and his daughters continue his work after he has been deceased. The remaining followers meet in the sisters' home, singing hymns and discussing scripture. The sisters' French servant, Babette, makes an appearance, and the narrator promises to tell how they got a French servant.

At this point, the story goes back in time, to where the minister is still alive and the sisters are young. We see the minister and his congregation meeting in a classic church and singing hymns that most American protestants could probably sing along to (if they weren't in Danish), and get a taste of Danish pietist culture. In the meantime, the sisters, being so attractive, attract various suitors. Their father turns them away, however, saying that his daughters is all he has. Soon, an officer of the Danish army, Lorens Lowenhaim, arrives in the village as punishment for dishonorable conduct. Lowenhaim is struck by Martina's beauty, and through the influence of his pious aunt, is able to get inside the minister's house. At that point, however, the officer realizes that he cannot stay there and marry Martina; life is too harsh and simple for one thing, and he wants to move up in his career. For another, he knows, even without Martina saying anything, that she would never leave the town. So Lowenhaim marries a lady of Queen Sophia's court, wooing her with piety, which was popular at the time.

Shortly thereafter, the French opera singer Achille Papin arrives from Paris, seeking some relaxation. He goes into the church and Philippa's singing impresses him greatly. He has dreams of her coming back to Paris and becoming an opera star. Papin asks for the minister's permission to give his daughter voice lessons, and even though he's a ""papist,"" the minister agrees. Philippa picks up very quickly and displays remarkable talent. Unfortunately, when Papin falls in love with her and tells her that she will make a great opera star, she relays to her father that she wants to stop the lessons, and the minister gives a letter to the opera singer to that effect. Broken-hearted, Papin returns to Paris on a boat.

Many years later, a young woman arrives on the sisters' doorstep during a storm. She carries a letter from Papin, urging them to take in the woman, Babette, as she is a refugee from the civil strife involving the 1871 Paris Commune. They agree to do so, and Babette becomes their servant (though unpaid). Babette's only connection to Paris is a lottery ticket which a friend renews for her every year. After working at the sisters' house for 14 years, Babette finally wins the lottery, and it appears that she will go back to Paris.

Meanwhile, Martina and Philippa are preparing a celebration of the deceased minister's 100th birthday. The congregation has grown quarrelsome, with constant mutual recriminations, and the hymns no longer bring the joy and unity they once did. They can only hope that celebrating the minister's birthday will bring unity to the group again. To their surprise, Babette wants to prepare a French dinner for the celebration, and they reluctantly agree. Martina and Philippa get even more apprehensive when they see all the ingredients that have arrived by overseas shipment, such as quails, turtles, and fine wine; they fear that they have invited witchcraft into their home, and the sisters and congregation agree not to discuss the food and drink during the meal. Another guest that shows up is the now-General Lowenhaim, Martina's old would-be suitor, and his aunt.

The feast is the most sumptuous that can be imagined. It includes real turtle soup, Blini Demidoff au Caviar (buckwheat cake with caviar), and Caille en Sarcophage- Quail in Puff Pastry Shell with Foie Gras and Truffle Sauce. Lowenhaim is the only one who comments on the food and wine. He relates that the feast reminds him of one that he had in Paris at a place called Cafe Anglais. The chef there, a woman, supposedly could turn a feast into a love affair, and blend bodily and spiritual appetites. The rest stubbornly maintain their vows not to talk about the feast. Despite their intransigence toward the food, the people in the congregation become more amiable to each other, and the peace and unity that the sisters tried to achieve has come back. The general at that point makes a speech, which is the highpoint of the movie. He talks about mercy, and about how in the end, everyone gets back what they rejected. When he leaves, he tells Martina that he will be with her every night in spirit. As for Babette, she does not go back to Paris after all, as she has spent all of her 10,000 francs on the feast. It turns out that she was the chef at Cafe Anglais, and is not worried about having no more money, because ""no artist is poor.""

It's wonderful how everything comes together in the end. The minister, Lowenhaim, Papin, the sisters,the congregation, and of course Babette have all contributed to what happens in the end. One comforting message of ""Babette's Feast"" is that earthly enjoyments can be a foretaste of the divine. Martina and Philippa had practiced a religion of denial, and were used to modest suppers of bread and baked cod, which is why they suspected witchcraft when they saw all the ingredients for Babette's feast. In the end, however, the feast becomes the means that the community is reconciled- it's a source of grace. I highly recommend this movie.",1199923200,5,5947,4.8821782178217825
325335,5,6301216156,"One Hundred and three minutes of a feast? Not much of a marketing ploy; however,there is clearly no other title which could do justice to this film.

The story is of epic proportion, and, as is with all epics, clearly leaves its audience with a classic, moral message.  At the same time, this epic in no way parallels the voyages of Odysseus or the legend of Beowulf, and, therein, lies the unparalleled beauty of this tale.

Unequivocally, do not disregard this movie owing to the inclusion of subtitles; they are hardly relevant.  As a public school teacher, I have many times had to entice jaded students into examining the beauty of Shakespearian text or encourage them to actively listen to Elizabethan language.  ""Babette's Feast"" requires only attention to action and expression to gain the timelessly unselfish message resonating forever at its conclusion.

Since then everyone to whom I have mentioned the movie simply lights up and glows in recollection.  The central actor is a lady chef, fleeing from the horrors of Paris (and presumably La Guillotine), who finds refuge with two unmarried ladies in Jutland. The epicurean attitudes of the French refugee is in stark contrast to the stoic existence of the two employers, most definitely in the area of cuisine.  Still, there is humor in the tiniest details, and it is the details that make the movie brilliant.  The original review follows.
===

This movie has a great many devoted fans, who view it regularly together in groups.  I'm one of them.  I'm a little behind, actually.

The story depicts a pair of puritanical Danish spinsters and a Parisienne master chef, who adopt each other, and their gentle and usually respectful attempts to understand each others' points of view.  The implied criticism of puritanism seems to be the central theme of the story, but I think the movie transcends the limited aims of the original novel.

I believe the author of this story is also the author of Out of Africa.  Perhaps it is her sardonic wit that provides the backbone for the humor in the movie, but the movie's genius simply defies analysis.

Your mileage will definitely vary, since the movie appeals to the experience of the viewer; those brought up in a strongly religious protestant home will probably appreciate the details a lot more.  But I will take a risk, and recommend it without reservation to everyone.

325338,5,6301216156,"This is an elegant film which tells a story filled with symbolism and meaning. The cinematography is outstanding. It is a highly focused story where dialogue is minimal but used to maximum effect. It is about committment, family loyalty, devotion to religion, love, charity, and worldly temptations. The film is based on a short book by Isak Dinesen titled ""Anecdotes of Destiny"". Most interesting is how much of the story and filming occurs within the small village in Denmark. Also, much of the story occurs when the main characters are elderly ...It is great story of faith and giving.

Taking place in the 19th century, Martina and Phillipa are the beautiful daughters of a Lutheran pastor in a fishing village in northern Denmark. Their father started a religious sect which is very austere and pious. It emphasizes the ""world to come"" and preaches controlling the passions and appetites of this world. The two lovely daughters never attend balls or parties so the young men who wish to make their acquaintance must attend her father's church to eye the two beauties and speak to them. Two young men in particular fall in love with these ladies but it is not within their destinies to fulfull their desires. Officer Lorens Lowenhielm enters the scene when he is sent back by the Army to live in the palace with his wealthy Aunt for a time. He falls in love with Martina when he first sees her while riding on the hillside of the village when she is drawing water from the well. She chooses to live with her father rather than marry this handsome officer. Phillipa's soprano voice is heard by a French visitor to the village, Achilles Papin who performs opera on the stage in Paris. He approachers her father to offer Phillipa private voice lessons. Achilles Papin is convinced Phillipa will ""wow"" the Parisians where she would become a diva ... Phillipa also declines to pursue this worldy temptation and remains living in the village with her father instead.

As the years pass, the beauty of the two sisters fades but never disappears. They perform works of charity for the poor, carrying on the devoted life to which they became accustomed after their father died. There remains a small flock of true believers who meet on Sundays to worship and recall the teachings of this pious man of the cloth. The two sisters receive a letter from Achilles Papin from Paris, asking the sisters to receive Babette into their home. She is a French lady who survived the French Revolution but lost all her family and possesions. She becomes their maid and servant ... making herself indespensible to their lives. The two sisters are able to carry out more of their charitable works and notice Babette has a way of helping them increase their income and livlihood as well.

Good fortune shines on Babette, after many years of servitude, she won the French lottery, a princely sum of 10,000 francs. On the 100th birthday of their father, Babette offers to cook a dinner for the sisters and the congregation. Despite some misgivings, the sisters agree. Everyone who attends promises not to show any pleasure in what they eat but to act ""just as if we never had a sense of taste"" for to enjoy would surely be viewed as a sin. They determine not to mention anything about the food when partaking of it.

It is a sensuous delight to watch Babette prepare the various courses ... The camera does a superb job of capturing the parishioner's faces who do their damndest to look sullen and neutral while eating this gourmet feast. There is a special dinner guest from the past ... It so happens he did *not* promise to deny his pleasure in dining on this feast. It is highly amusing to watch the guests respond with remarks about the weather as this special guest describes each succulent and delectable dish. His  expressions of appreciation for each French delicacy is priceless. He especially appreciates the superb Spanish wine and champagne, which it is noted none of the parishioners refuse. It is quite funny, watching them  imitate the guest as he eats each course.

The romantic exuberance of the French servant-woman Babette as she brings to the island village that is her refuge the sensuality of a lavish feast does not reduce the disciplined and selfless orthodoxy of the Lutheran sect to ridicule. Rather, there is room for a certain conversion in *both* directions, a cross-pollenation that Blixen and her cinematic interpreters allow themselves to relish.

Blixen left us a great story. It has been made into a memorable film that belongs on the 'keeper' shelf of viewers who love a story.

I couldn't see what it was trying to achieve.  Watching the feast being prepared and served was interesting.  It was also amusing seeing the positive changes in the supposedly pious people after they were given multiple glasses of wine and delicious gourmet food.  Prior to the meal they were bickering and arguing; after the meal was well in progress they all turned into much sweeter people and left at the end of the meal in much more pleasant moods.  The point was what?  Give people good wine and good food and they act better than they do otherwise?  As far as the two women giving up love in their lives to remain in a small town serving God and their father, the question is why?  It isn't answered in the film; at least not to my satisfaction.  And why the devotion of Babette to them; again there doesn't seem to be much of an answer provided.  There seemed to be no conflict in their hearts either; just blind devotion to God.  That's a wonderful thing, but it doesn't make an interesting movie.  The people in this movie never do anything interesting.",1172102400,9,1214,4.4343891402714934

Frankly, the DANISH - FRENCH with subtitles is much more enjoyable. So I recommed using THAT CHOICE which you get on a DVD.

Here's another way of enjoying this movie. Just picture the cast of colorful ACTORS just being themselves after every scene.

They are cast in their roles of being these dreary Danish Protestants stuck in a place without a tree or flower or a blade of grass to lighten up the monotony. But I bet the cast were roaring with laughter every time the director yelled CUT!

I have recommended Gabriel Axel's film version of Babette's Feast many times over the years and treasure it as one of my all-time favorite films, alongside the John Huston film of Joyce's ""The Dead.""  For me, ""Babette's Feast"" is a story and a film about grace.  It is about learning to accept that one cannot control the operations of grace; one can only accept the feast of grace in whatever befuddling form it comes.  The sisters and their fellow sectarians are unexpectedly seduced and struck dumb by an embracing warmth, of which their sacrificial devotion to their father and his austere religion had long deprived them.  The general, who had unrequitedly wooed one of the sisters so many years before and whose successful military career had been a rigid bulwark against the pain of that renunciation, is touched by grace and wonder and acceptance.  And Babette, the angel of the story, is also the refugee soul whose losses in life are transfigured by the grace of giving, of voluntary servanthood.",1169251200,8,1223,4.850961538461538

I was surprised when I first purchased the video that the story was by the great Isak Dinsen who wrote Out of Africa.  I won't elaborate on the other reviewers who succinctly posted their thoughts, but I agree with most of them that this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made.

From the first moments of the film where we are introduced to the sisters and their minister father who live in a desolate town on the coast of Denmark and then to the ""feast"" itself, I was totally entranced.  The scenery was bleak but beautiful, as was the total dedication of this family to the people in this small community.

The part of Babette was played by the glorious French actress Stephane Audran.  You may have seen in her in many French movies, one in particular, Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, and as the mistress of Lawrence Olivier in Bridehead Revisited.  Could anyone be so wonderfully French!  And so beautiful!

The scenes in the small kitchen where Babette cooks her ""feast"" are undeniably the highlight of the film. I felt like I was there in the kitchen with them with the scents and the heat from the oven. The poor turtle (did they really cook it?), the squabs, the delicious wines.  The looks on the faces of the religious communants when they sampled all of the wonderful dishes along with the wonderful wines.

And the ending, which I won't give away here.  But it was very heartwarming and funny!  Needless to say, this is a movie that should be in everyone's collection who love classic movies.  And this is, in my estimation, a real classic.",1161734400,21,1675,4.536666666666667
325428,5,6301216156,"I first saw this film about 10 years ago, and, no matter how many times I watch it, I am still amazed.  It handles art, religion, love, lust, ambition, and yes, food.  It skewers it's own characters as well as small town life for frequent giggles, but then stumbles unexpectedly into moments of extremely lonely, soul-searching seriousness.  It is both harsh and tender.  It is about religion and art, but never preaches either.  It simply tries to answer the question all of its characters ask themselves at one point or another: Why am I here?  What is my purpose in life?

This sort of weighty dialectic gives it it's scope, and the film answers this question with grace, humility and a sense of humor.  The food doesn't come until late in the film (about 40 years into the onscreen story), and seems to posit an answer having something to do with humans needing to acknoledge that they are of the flesh in order to find spiritual grace.

Very rewarding - my highest recommendation.",1156896000,11,985,4.6473988439306355
325429,5,6301216156,"I apologize for stealing my review title from another reviewer.  But that reviewer really put it well: how could a movie about a MEAL be interesting, in any way, shape, or form? More than that: how could it be a masterpiece?

I can only offer my own insight that masterpieces are almost always complete surprises.  A good example is ""The Little Prince,"" which is ""only"" a silly short book about some imaginary prince-boy living way off in outer space, with clumsy illustrations by the author to boot.  But it's a masterpiece: it has been translated into umpteen languages, and has sold more millions of copies than I would ever be able to count.

Why?  I would guess it's because the characters, through the magic of fiction, reach out and grab you and make you care about them.

""Strangely enough,"" the same is true of ""Babette's Feast.""  It takes place in a tiny fishing community, and has what must be the most vivid characters I have seen in years.  No, not Fellini's gross exaggerations: we are looking at Real People here, and the values which shape their actions and their lives.  There are important themes in the movie, very important ones: is being ""morally good"" enough to guarantee happiness?  Or is there a role for simple pleasure in the grand scheme of things?  The film does not really answer these questions, but it does ask them, and it suggests that a radical religious Puritanism, which turns all pleasure aside at the door, may not be the complete definition of the good life.  (In this context, you might to look at Henry James's movel, ""The Europeans.""  Did Isak Dineson read that novel, I wonder?)

The movie is, on one level, a comic delight --- a wonderful light comedy.  But it probes some of the deepest questions we ever have to ask ourselves.  We may all admit that a life spent giddily pursuing pleasure is bound to be superficial, but is there really any point to denying ourselves the pleasures that life offers?

A world-famous writer used to fry (!) Oscar Mayer bologna, and eat it with Campbell's soup.  One wonders what he would have thought of Babette's feast.

325450,4,6301216156,"Babette Feast

This movie is about two sisters, Martina and Philippa who are the daughters of a local pastor in a small Danish community. Their father, Vicor taught them religious values, enabling them to learn the importance of faith and God. As young ladies, these two girls are really attractive. They both are courted by two successful men.  But they choose to stay devote to their father and religion.

 Later, Babette who fled from Paris comes to be the servants for the two sisters. She remains faithful and serves the two sisters for a very long period of time. After 14 years of service, Babette wins lottery and she insists to prepare a French feast for the sisters, celebrating the anniversary of the dead man, Vicar's birth. Babette's meal brings color to the town and emphasizes the real beauty of the life in the world God created.

 I really like the character Babette. As a servant, she is very humble and lovely. She tries her best to serve the sisters and do things always benefit the sisters. I think she sacrificed a lot to the family and influenced the sisters as well as the community. When she wins the lottery, she chooses to stay and spends all the money for a French feast. This shows her generosity and caring for others. She is not selfish; indeed, she wants to help the sisters. For normal people that win lottery, they will all choose to use that money for a better life instead of being a servant serving others. But Babette choose to remain poor and uses all the money for others. My favorite scene in the move is the Babette feast. Some parts of the scene are very funny. I enjoys the way how Babette tries to bring out her message of love through the meal. Babette is a central character of the film and she also brings out the theme of the story through the preparation of the feast and the actual feast. Babette allowed the sisters to think and learn another kind of joy and happiness.

She comes as an exile to a lowly place and spends her life in uncomplaining service to the two sisters.  Then she sacrifices everything she has to create a feast which transforms its (undeserving) partakers into people able to leave pettiness behind and ""have life more abundantly.""

I don't wish to spoil this movie for those who have never seen it but suffice to say that there is alot more to Babette than meets the eye. All characters are intertwined in some way.
  Babette's quote about artists at the very end is climactic.  What many people don't realize is that the film shows the uphill battles artitsts must face against a world of practicality, religious dogmas, peoples' spats with each other, and shifting tides of political upheaval. As you'll see in the film,the urban environment is no haven either. Artists just want to be given a chance to ""do their best"". Babette gives all of what she has to do this.

325491,4,6301216156,"`Babette's Feast', a film in Danish directed by Gabriel Axel and based on a story by Isak Dinesen was an Academy Award winner for best foreign film for its year of release and it is commonly held up as one of the better movies involving food. My recollection of my first viewing of the movie several years ago sustains the sense that this is a superior movie. That sense did not survive my current viewing of the film. Foreign language films, especially Scandinavian films, are typically a lot more subtle than comparable American movies, but this film is simply too low key to merit high praise.

The story centers around two sisters living in a small Danish community in Jutland (in modern Denmark), just across the straits from Stockholm, Sweden. I would need to consult my history to be sure of this, but I sense that at the time of this story in the latter half of the 19th century, Denmark was part of Sweden. The defining element in the two sisters' life was their father, who was a local religious leader of some note, powerful enough to hold sway over the lives of the small community even 100 years after his birth and death in late middle age. Before the main action of the movie, the sisters, especially the more attractive one played by Bibi Anderson has semiserious romantic encounters with first a lieutenant in the Swedish army and then a noted French tenor who is vacationing in Jutland for his health.

We reach the heart of the matter when a French refugee from the disturbances in Paris in 1871 is sent to live with the two sisters by the French tenor as an escape from political persecution. As the refugee, our Babette of the title, learns how to prepare the `cuisine' of Jutland, based on dried and salted fish, stale bread, and salt pork, we see her managing the sisters' household with greater skill than the sisters themselves. The climax to the story is set up with the coincidental 100th anniversary of the father's birth with Babette's winning 10,000 francs in a French lottery. In gratitude for Babette's being sheltered by the sisters, Babette volunteers to prepare the centenary dinner for the community by preparing a `real French meal'. In spite of the religious austerity of the community, the sisters agree and Babette is off to buy provisions, returning with all sorts of exotic foodstuffs, including a cage full of live grouse and a very large, live sea turtle.

The great problem of the story arises when the sisters and their community become apprehensive about the risk to their religiosity that may be posed by a gourmet meal. Hence, they all agree to eat the meal without taking any pleasure in the feast. Their resolve becomes unraveled when the nephew of one of the community members, a general who has seen much of the world, including Paris, is invited to the feast of 12 guests. Oddly, any analogy to the Last Supper is so subtle I'm afraid it escapes me, other than the number of diners.

The feast is resolved with all the community members being warmed to appreciate one another, the general revealing that Babette was the greatest woman chef in Paris, and the discovery that Babette spent her entire winnings on buying the means to offer the feast.

I have no idea if Dinesen's story makes more of this fable than we see in the movie. I certainly see some missed opportunities in not exploring the legitimacy of austerity versus our best understanding of Protestant doctrine.

The one way in which the movie rises above others is in the interest and accuracy in the preparation of the dishes. The script and the camera doesn't `dwell' on the food as you may see in the famous dining scene in `Tom Jones', but it does show enough to appreciate that the culinary consultant to the movie earned his pay in creating interesting and accurate 19th century French dishes.

While I sense I may have missed some subtitles in this movie, I'm keen enough to recognize that whatever I did miss would not add a lot to the movie.

If you happen to be fond of food movies, this one is very good, but not as good as `Tampopo' or Stanley Tucci's `Big Night'.",1123027200,4,4093,4.635862068965517

325493,5,6301216156,"Some might say ""Babette's Feast"" symbolically begins when Babette plans to make a meal only princes have enjoyed before.

The story, and its subsequent message of grace and glory, truly begins when Babette is received by two middle-aged women with nothing to offer but their home. Babette has nothing to give that they want, and so the relationship grows from this tiny movement of mutual grace.

Babette, an acclaimed chef, needs to hide for political reasons. She is introduced to sisters Martine and Filippa by way of a letter from a mutual friend. As they hire her with no promise of payment, Babette offers to cook for the sisters who know nothing of Babette's reputation in the kitchen. More than a ""Stone Soup"" chicanerist, she has the ability to do much with little. Humbly, she lets the sisters teach her to make potato soup. Esculent in every way a potato soup could be, the meal convinces the sisters they have made the right move.

Based on a story by Isak Dinesen (author of ""Out of Africa"") found in her collection, ""Anecdotes of Destiny,"" it is not a story about the clichd sensual delights of food, as found in lesser films such as ""Chocolat."" It is about the grace of being humble, of serving, and of enjoying both the simple and grand things of God. Whether making potato soup or quail in vol-au-vents, Babette always is thankful and diligent to do her best.

When Babette wins the lottery, she decides to make a meal as thanks to the town. She orders delicacies unheard of, and asks the community to help prepare the feast. Skepticism dies down as her neighbors sample morsels, and a new life comes to the village. This is where the comparisons to ""Chocolat"" begin and end, as Babette's only desire is to lift the spirits of the town she has been so much blessed by.

The long table of near-gluttonous dining is memorable. It far exceeds any American Thanksgiving dinner cornucopia overflow, yet is as thankful. So much of the movie culminates then, and the movie satisfies the deepest hunger for a tasty conclusion.

Finding a layer by which to appreciate ""Babette's Feast"" is just a matter of watching. For Christians, you will find a subtext of understanding simplicity vs displaying gifts from God. For foodies, you will watch a dream meal presented as Julia Child herself never imagined. For cinematography buffs, you will see a French village shot in intimate detail, so as if you could smell the door frame wood after the rain.

She recommended Babette's Feast.  The only thing they have in common are some great cooking scenes.  ""Mostly Martha"" is a much better movie as far as I am concerned.

I guess I don't understand the puritan point of view and I was waiting for the villagers to change.  But it never happened.  Yes, they enjoyed a good dinner and went home happy, but I believe it will be back to normal the next day while they wait to die and then everything will be lovely.  And Babette.  Why has she also given up on this life?  There were people in the village who seemed interesting and potential friends.

Perhaps the feast in the movie does represent the last supper.  Then who is Jesus?  Babette?  Why?  And are the choices and lives that the people have led supposed to mean something special at the end of the movie? What was gained by choosing the lives they did?  All this sacrifice so that maybe in heaven one sister will get to sing and Babette will get to be a chef and the angels will appreciate them.

But the story isn't about the feast any more than ""Casablanca"" is about a city in Morocco.  The story is about sacrifice and friendship and honor.  Many characters in this film make difficult choices during their lives, and although you don't necessarily see regret over and over, you can plainly see silent reflective thoughts about ""what might have been"".

Babette's feast is not some ""movie with a message"" otherwise it wouldn't be any good. But it's so real and poignant that much truth can be seen in it, spiritual truth and insights which shed light onto human nature. The relationships are very natural and believable, but the style of narration keeps the story from any kind of overly-subjective viewpoint which infects many movies which delve into human relationships. The actions and conversations arise very naturally and advance the plot superbly.
Another thing which I love about the movie is that it reveals something about the nature of good, evil, grace and redemption. None of the acting characters in the movie are ""evil""; however many are infected with smaller sins of pettiness, lack of generosity, glorying in the defeat of others, scrupulosity, jealousy, etc. This movie shows how these defects - small but many - have taken all the joy and pleasure out of life for those suffering under them and that to forgive and be forgiven is necessary to restore the joy of life.

When Babette wins the lottery, she (a former gourmet chef) spends every centime on the preparation of a sumptuous feast of many courses with separate wines for each as her offering of gratitude for their sheltering her.
To watch the arrival of the exotic ingredients, the preparation, the serving, the gradual loosening of tight strictures as the villagers sample, taste, savor, and dive in, tongues and belts and opinions gradually loosened by the effects of exquisite food and wine, is to be seduced as surely as by a lover.

This is the story of a French woman who reluctantly finds herself on Danish soil in order to escape upheavel in France during one of it's many revolutions.
She is a 10 star chef but enters as a maidservant for these two homely sisters that basically eat puritanical food and dress the same. Not realizing who they have amongst them, they go about average every day ""bla"" that they call life. However, their new servant is spicing life up little by little for the people around her simply by adding flavor to little things like soup, etc.
Because of her talents everyone simply has a more tolerable life in the Danish village. Then it gets astoundingly better when Babette wins some money and opts to use it to purchase ingredients for the best feast she can imagine, just like she did at her restraunt in France.
The nervous sisters apologize beforehand to the Villagers as if they have something to be ashamed of simply because Babette asked them to organize a feast. It's amazing what religion and puritanical beliefs rob people of. Don't you agree? (Said blowing a kiss in the air and taking a drag of an imaginary cigarette).
Needless to say, the Villagers were changed in an almost spiritual way after the meal that love produced.

So what is grace?
How did they miss it so long?
How could someone so talented be content to cook stale wet bread and boiled dried cod?
Grace is free for the receivers, expensive to the giver.
We can spend a lifetime fighting grace and completely miss the point. It is there among us all the time. but we miss it because we are looking for it in the wrong places.

325539,4,6301216156,"The story takes place in a remote town in Denmark. There is one grocery in the town. Not much changes. The town's people are self-sufficent.
  The camera is moving slowly. Even though the last part is the delightful feast, the overall atmosphere isn't light. The two sisters lead their religious life, which is so restricted, somewhat closed. They are living like in a monastery. But after Babette comes to the villge, some liveliness springs up. When she buys fish from a fisherman, she bargains for more fish and sings in the grocery. She knows the joy of life.
  Babbette's feast is to deliver her appreciation to the sisters. I think this movie conveys God's grace is like Babette's devotion which let people enjoy their life and love one another.

325540,5,6301216156,"The film revolves around a simple, god-fearing, rural community. They can remind you a lot of Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter village. Given the right circumstances-famine, epidemic, or natural disaster-you can easily imagine them looking around for witches to burn.
 What keeps this lot in line is the steadying influence of two sisters who commit their lives to caring for their community and keeping the flame of their tiny puritanical sect. See them making ale soup, carting it over to their elderly neighbors, and serving it up out of a tureen. See them leading the hymns around the dining room table where they conduct their bible studies.
 Their commitment comes with a steep personal price tag. One of them has given up the love of a wealthy and powerful man. The other renounced a brilliant career in the opera. The members of their fellowship repay them, not with gratitude and right living, but by bickering among themselves over petty slights, some commited decades ago.
 This is where a lesser film would invite the viewer to conclude, ""What a waste. What a train wreck.""
 But Babette's Feast doesn't let you dismiss the self sacrifice of these two gentle women that easily. Yes, they could have made more of a splash, they could have had a lot more fun, they could have been written up, they could have had bigger funerals.
 But, in the vast spectrum, is what they achieve really less important? Death is the great equalizer, and, in old age, we mystically repossess both what we affirmed and what we rejected, this film would have you believe, reminding viewers of some of Bergman's more baffling religious hypotheses.
 That said, the story of these two dedicated sisters would be virtually unbearable without the curveball thrown into their lives by their maid, Babette, a refugee from the French revolution. One of the Danish sisters' scorned lovers sends Babette their way because he knows their kindness and sincere Christianity will not allow them to abandon her.
 Babette blends seamlessly into this strict Danish household, serving endless pots of tea to the fellowship and learning to make ale soup without grimacing. In fact, she is so stoical about all the household's petty economies that we know at once there's more to Babette than meets the eye. No ordinary person could ask for so little or display so little ego.
 After 20 years of haggling over the price of locally caught fish and sorting through the market potatoes, Babette wins the lottery. She takes a brisk stroll down to the beach and looks out over the water, presumably in the direction of France. There she makes her decision. She will cook a good French dinner for the people who, in all ignorance and kindness, took her in so many years ago. Whether they like it or not.
 The caravan of excellent wines and exotic foods-including live quail in cages-that starts arriving at their house throws the sisters into a religious tizzy. Will they lose their souls to all this worldliness?
 One of the guests recognizes Babette from an escargot dish she serves, and the secret of her identity is revealed.
 The tug of war in this film between self-sacrifice and self-indulgence, simplicity and luxury, is so intense, we keep expecting someone to be badly hurt.  But the beauty is, no one does. And director Gabriel Axel leads us to an unexpectedly sweet and slightly comical ending while making a statement along the way about the strength and independence of the true artist.",1048377600,14,3456,4.888888888888889

Freed, they dine exquisitely on the grace theirs from ""extra nos,"" outside them and their world.  Pleasures of a rich and foreign place.  Sacrificially given to them, everything laid out before them on the banquet meal, a foretaste of the feast eternal.

The story is simple.  Two pious Danish sisters hire a French maid, Babette, out of a sense of charity.  Fourteen years later, Babette wins the lottery.  Out of her winnings, she proposes to serve the sisters and their fellow religionists a meal.
The film is simple.  And like all things that are truly simple, it is a very, very rich feast.
The film can be enjoyed on many levels, but it is an overtly Christian film; and the feast is the Lord's Supper.  Babette's gift to the sisters and their community is the gift of grace.  Unasked for, unearned, and of inestimable value.
The sisters were daughters of a stern Protestant who had formed a devout community.  When the sisters were young and beautiful, they were each tempted by the chance to have great love and success outside their community.  But they remained loyal to their father and their faith.  After their father died, they carried on with their faith community.  But as the years passed by, bickering and dissension set in.
One rainy day, there is a knock on the door and Babette appears in their doorway.  She has a letter of introduction from one of the sister's old love, and they decide to take her in.  Babette quietly makes herself indispensable to the sisters and the entire village.  One day, she wins the lottery, and the sisters assume that she will now leave them.  Before leaving them, however, she insists on serving them a proper French meal.
The meal itself is the center of the film, and during that meal all the threads of the film are richly woven together.  The pious sisters and their community finally learn the true depths of faith - something which is more than just what we believe, but rather also reflects what we do and the love with which we do it.  They are twelve to supper, and that number is no accident.  Nor is the grace that flows through that meal.  Any Christian can appreciate its significance.  And anyone who loves the Eucharist can only smile in joy, when one of the guests identifies the main dish as ""Caille en Sarcophage"" (Quail in a sarcophagus.)  He retails a story of the time he ate this extraordinary meal in a fine Parisian restaurant.  The other guests smile, but miss his drift.  And he exclaims, ""But this really *is* Caille en Sarcophage!""  They still do not understand, but the meal works its magic nonetheless.
This is a film of the sacramental vision - God's rich love reaching out to us body and soul.",1025654400,288,2656,4.527310924369748
325552,5,6301216156,"This is truly a spiritually uplifting film.  The woman, Babette, becomes maid and cook for two older women in a Danish village.  By the time she comes into the tale, you know the story of the two women.  She becomes one of the family, and then a miracle happens and she wins the lottery.  Her thought then is to cook a feast in honor of their deceased minister father, a feast which these people have never dreamed of, something completely different from the plain simple cooking they're used to.
There is much more than that in the film.  The two women are such that it seems sinful to have a lavish gourmet dinner.  The feast sequence is a long, lovingly developed treat for the eyes.  And of course, we realize that Babette is up to a bit more than just providing a sumptious feast.
Underneath, the film is telling of a joyous spirit who responds to good fortune by using it to show her love, to do something that will actually endure long after the food is gone.
Much has been said by others about this film, so I content myself with pointing out the deep spiritual feel here, the contrast of the love that Babette shows with the piety of the village, and the example she is of the love for others and for life.

325568,5,6301216156,"Flawlessly directed, written, performed, and filmed, this quiet and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best, and if a person exists who can watch BABETTE'S FEAST without being touched at a very fundamental level, they are a person I do not care to know.

The story is quite simple. In the 1800s, two elderly maiden ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities, and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman, Babette (Stphane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services, the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined; indeed, the entire village admires and depends upon her.

One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation.  The meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected, for Babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her.

The film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to God and their all-too-human frailties, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, including WATER FOR CHOCOLATE and CHOCOLATE, but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul. Highly, highly recommended.

325569,5,6301216156,"Twenty years ago nothing put terror in my heart like being invited to watch a foreign film. The deliberate pacing and low-key style annoyed the daylights out of me. But getting closer to Social Security, I find myself enjoying films like Babbette's Feast more than the typical frenetic American box office hit. The best description I can offer for this movie is ""visual poetry."" There are so many layers to this deceptively simple story, that each repeated viewing offers some previously unnoticed delight. This is one offering that can never be praised enough.",1014076800,7,561,5.043010752688172
325570,5,6301216156,"Few directors choose to take anything more than very safe chances concerning any religious themes in the films they direct nowadays, but this film makes a seeming deliberate attempt to take the topic of Christianity head-on, and with absolutely beautiful and poignant results.  Whereas many who view this film might fail to understand or comprehend the elaborate allegory relating to Christianity being unfolded in this film, not knowing this ahead of time actually contributes to the eventual discovery of the beauty of the allegory and its pageantry on display in this wonderful rendering of the story of Christ's Last Supper.  Babette, the main character, prepares the most delicious and elaborate meal of the highest order that one could ever hope for in a lifetime of dining, and cooks all of it behind a veil of almost no recognition by her diners, who, having savored all, give virtually no real thanks to her for her genius at culinary artistry and the personal sacrifice of money made in their behalf.  The parallel to Christ's Last Supper and His sacrifice through the Atonement is unmistakeable to those who are versed in this important central doctrine of Christianity.  Notwithstanding this potentially overt treatment of a sensitive subject, those who seek to see other themes in this lovely film will also not go unrewarded.  It is a film to be savored, and then watched and savored again, as was the feast that Babette prepared for her loved ones.",1006300800,13,1463,5.004115226337449
325571,5,6301216156,"The feast of the title doesn't take place until well into the film.  In fact, the majority of the film is spent telling the story of 2 godly sisters and the choices they made in life.  Both sisters passed up true love and the promise of success in order to remain faithful to their religious beliefs.  Instead they pass their lives assisting their minister father and carry on his work after his death.  They continue their quiet lives past mid-life until one of the sisters' former suitors sends them a Parisian refugee, Babette.  Babette spends 14 years with the sisters as cook, her only link to her former life being a lottery ticket that a friend in Paris renews for her every year.  One day she wins the lottery and decides to use the money to prepare a sumptous dinner for the sisters and their small congregation.  More than just an epicurean delight the feast is an outpouring of Babette's gratitude.
If the plot sounds thin, be assured it's anything but.  The story is as rich and satisfying as the feast Babette prepares.  We see the delicate romances that develop for each sister and understand their reasons for turning their suitors away.  We see the lives the sisters, and their men, have led after making their decision.  The feast comes at a time when the sisters are asking themselves questions that they never voice: Did they make the right decision all those years ago?  Was it worth it?  Reassurance comes in an unexpected and exquisitely romanitc way.
This film is such a wonderful example of what happens when filmmakers are interested in telling a good story and telling it well.  It doesn't follow a 'formula' or cater to a demographic and is a perfect example of why independent and foreign films are so much more satisfying than Hollywood movies.",1005955200,449,1773,4.6957928802588995
325572,5,6301216156,"This is such a beautiful little film from the bleak opening scenes of a windswept Danish fishing village to the delectable final scene of Babette's masterful <<diner francais>>.  The most well-known sequence of the film is Babette's dinner preparations - her deft and loving handling of luscious gourmet fare.  But this movie is also filled with amusing contrasts and the difficult choices certain characters must make between offering their incomparable talents to the world or laying them to rest in their quiet village.  What makes these choices even more heart-rending is the quiet resignation and dignity of each of the characters.
We are introduced to the spartan lives of a small religious circle led by a stern but gentle minister.  His two attractive young daughters are quietly devoted to him and are each tested by temptations of the world beyond the village.  In one instance, the musically-gifted daughter is discovered by a famous musician and given voice lessons in which even her scales are angelically sung.  She sings the ""temptation scene"" from Mozart's Don Giovanni (La ci darem la mano) with her worldly music teacher - it was cleverly done and quite lovely.
The years pass, and by request of the musician, the elderly sisters take in a mysterious Parisian refugee, Babette, who has a knack for making even ale-bread palatable.  The most remarkable segment of the film follows Babette's first and only request to prepare an anniversary dinner in memory of the deceased minister. Thanks to the invitation of an important last minute guest, her artistic ""signature"" is recognized and truly appreciated.  Amidst the ordinary, pious religious members, this guest savors with surprise the delectable dishes (turtle soup, blini Demidoff with caviar, quail with truffle) and finest wines (Veuve Cliquot, Amontillado, Clos Vougeot!) offered to him in a little white-washed village cottage.  This dinner scene has numerous subtle nuances that can only be picked up by seeing it many times.

325573,4,6301216156,"If you are a fan of foreign films, this is a French Classic for the patient viewer who wants to view life from a spiritual perspective. In this movie, the members of a church, seem to have chosen a very simple existence. Bread and Ale are common fare and a real French dinner seems sinful to them.

There are many scenes of singing hymns and living a simple life. The main story revolves around two women who instead of finding love and a life of their own, choose to stay with their father and help him in his ministry. Even after their father has moved on to eternity, they are consumed with charitable work and never start their own families.

One year, a lady from France is sent to find them to seek refuge from certain death in Paris. Babette suppresses her own desires and cooks what the two women want until one day she wins the lottery and asks them if she can cook dinner for what would have been their father's 100th birthday. They grant her this wish and then soon feel regret and even fear that they will be punished for experiencing such pleasure.

What happens next surprises us all. I don't want to spoil a single minute, but there
are some really funny lines near the end. This movie has a subtle charm of its own.

Oh, to have been Babette!
What fun she had making others happy.
What a beautiful spirit she portrays.

A profound statement of human kindness. This movie will leave you with a sense of peace and purpose. It will change the way you think about life.

I had not seen it for over ten years, but I was immediately captivated by its nuance, symbolism, and beauty. I hope to show it my students some time this year.
The film explores the meaning of Christian existence, the relationship of asceticism and the aesthetic, reconciliation, forgiveness, and, most of all, God's grace in its manifold forms and dimensions. I found it deeply moving without being sentimental or maudlin.
The scenes move at a calm pace, very unlike American ""action"" movies that sacrifice plot and character for the sake of special effects. One must attend to this film to receive its graces. As C.S. Lewis put it, the film must be ""received"" (carefully observed for what it is, so it may act on us) rather than ""used"" (employed to ""kill time"" or achieve some predetermined end). It should be viewed several times, preferably in a setting where one can discuss it with thoughtful people. It may touch the soul.

325576,5,6301216156,"Babette's Feast demonstrates one advantage the motion picture has over all other art forms.  As the feast that gives the film its name progresses, we watch the reaction of each of the guests at the table to each new culinary delight served by the chef, Babette.  These rough and common folk have been taught that heaven should be the focus of their lives, not the pleasures of this world, and they learn at this feast the lesson of Saint Francis that God's gifts are meant to be enjoyed in the here and now.  At first the guests doubt themselves.  Can food really be this good?  As each dish is served we watch with utter delight ourselves as they realize that a bit of heaven has been served up to them free of charge in this world.  Additionally, something more profound occurs. The love Babette puts in to her gift of this banquet to repay the two sisters who take her in to their home when she was in need of help repairs old wounds and annimosities and the people at the table learn that forgiveness, like good food, is something to be practiced and shared in this world.
Babette's Feast is a film to be viewed more tnan once.  I loved it the first time I saw it and had a deeper appreciation of it the second time around.

325588,5,6301216156,"The story unfolds in a small, seaside Danish village.  We watch patiently as the minister and his two lovely daughters lead their church and community through enlightenment and devout prayer.  Rather than seeking marriage or fame, the sisters' faith and devotion to God keep them in this picturesque little hamlet well into late age, long after the minister's passing.  At the request of a dear friend, the sisters are urged to take in a Parisian refuge in an effort to save her life during her government's turmoil.  Babette becomes cook and housekeeper for the ladies.
Many years later, Babette learns she's won the Paris lottery and decides to host a feast for the kindly sisters and the community that took her in.  Though slow moving at first, the story gradually picks up momentum, interest and laughs along the way.  The highlight is in the preparation and presentation of the feast itself; to the simple people of the village who have never before experienced such an exotic fare.  Unbeknownst to everyone, Babette was the head chef at one of Paris' foremost restaurants and a personal favorite of Parisian royalty and dignitaries.
A delightful film and a treasure for any international collector.  The characters are realistically wonderful and cast beautifully.  While filled with many charming moments and excellent performances, the entire film is an absolute delight and highly suitable for family viewing.

However, we both kept reading that everyone left the film absolutely ravenous for food after visually feasting upon sublime course after course for 2 hours.  Thus, when we saw that an excellent French restaurant would serve us the entire meal just prior to our seeing the film, we decided to go for it. The food was absolutely out of this world and we showed up for the film well stuffed. We were thus able to really enjoy the quiet pleasures of the film where Babette, taken in by two elderly sisters in a small village when in dire need, shows her gratitude and love for them by preparing this feast when she wins the lottery.  We, of course, learn everything we need to know about the lives of the sisters and Babette as the feast progresses.  This film deservedly won the foreign film Oscar.

325592,5,6301216156,"""Babette's Feast"" is one of those rare, delicate films that appeals across a broad spectrum of beliefs and expectations. It matters not whether you are liberal or conservative, spiritual or secular: There is nothing not to like about this movie. If you (1) believe that good, well-prepared food can be spiritually-uplifting, and (2) you enjoyed the recent Lasse Halstrom film ""Chocolat,"" then you should purchase ""Babette's Feast"" ASAP.
Stephane Audran plays Babette Hersant, a refugee from civil war-torn France who finds sanctuary in the home of two elderly sisters living in a small village on the barren Jutland coast in Denmark. The religious community the sisters belong to is one in which denial of Earthly pleasure is key to one's spiritual redemption; yet unbeknownst to them, Babette was a gourmet chef of considerable renown back in France. Later, in gratitude to the villagers for their kindness, Babette offers to prepare them a French gourmet dinner; and although the villagers reluctantly agree to this extravagance, the soon realize that they may be opening themselves up to temptations of an almost diabolical nature. So before dinner is served, they agree amongst themselves to eat the meal without necessarily ENJOYING it. The ensuing scene at the dinner table, in which the guests are so obviously enjoying the meal yet unable to say so, is delightful.
I'm especially pleased with this DVD transfer. The last time I saw this film was by way of an old VHS copy, and while the story was imminently enjoyable, the picture was scratchy and washed-out compared this new release; this new transfer is fresh and rich-looking. For people who don't care for subtitles, there is the option of watching this film dubbed in English, but I wouldn't recommend it, because the actress used for Babette's voice speaks in a higher pitch and makes the woman sound like something of a French sex kitten.",981504000,24,1904,5.0476190476190474

The DVD is, without a doubt, THE format for this movie.  The print has been considerably cleaned up and brightened.  What a difference with my ""old"" fuzzy VHS copy!  The widescreen format benefits this film tremendously.  The sound is crisp and even, with no sudden drops or surges in volume.  The DVD offers three language tracks: the original Danish/French, English, and Spanish.  I personally recommend that you keep the Danish/French track with English subtitles.  It's the only real way to convey the full meaning and emotions of the story.  Avoid the English track at all costs: it's unbelievably bland and emotionless (thereby removing any and all subtleties and charm from this superb story) and it's muffled.

325595,5,6301216156,"Take the style of Ingmar Bergman, stir in some Lutheranism, add a dash of Guy De Maupassant, a pinch of Chekov (such a severe and forbidding brew!).  Mix well with the grand cuisine of nineteenth century France and what do you have?  Babette's Feast!

Our story (from an Isak Dinesen short story) is of two lovely maiden sisters from Jutland, the pious daughters of a stern and dictatorial minister, who spurn their chance for love to remained devoted to their austere Protestant creed and to their puritanical and selfish father.  We are subjected to the bleak, harsh winters, to the endless hours of knitting, to the long silences and the sighs upon sighs...  Ah, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Swedes, how beautifully they brood!  We see the barren beauty of Martina, who so enchanted the young cavalryman that when he could not melt her cold, cold heart, he instead vowed to be a success, and succeeded!  And then there came the baritone from the Paris opera who heard her sister Phillipa's soprano voice at choir and fell immediately and hopeless in love with her, and sought to train her voice and carry her away.  But no, he too could not melt the snows of her near Arctic heart, and so returned to Paris where he played out his (now) empty career.

Flash forward to the entrance of Babette, whom the opera singer sends many years later to the sisters to hide from the strife in France.  She will be an angel of gastronomy, household management and common sense who will mend their souls and fill them with joy.

This is a tale of unrequited love.  Of love that festers and longs and does not die.  How I adore the love stories where the love is never consummated!  I love the years of yearning, the melancholy realization that it could never work, and yet, and yet...  And then when they are old and past any pretense, how wonderful it is to know that the anticipation, the savoring, the longing, the utter lack of finality, how wonderful THAT was, and how superior to a banal consummation!

But then, such is not the usual taste.  Speaking of tastes, this is not a movie to see on an empty stomach.  The climatic feast of turtle soup, quail in pastry, rich sauces, dessert, fromage, fruit, etc., washed down with amontillado, champagne, etc. will whet your appetite.  A little stunning for this modest epicure was the Clos de Vougeot, 1845 that the general so admired.  Can you imagine how beautiful that wine was, and what it would fetch today!

This is also a tale of Christian piety, and a joining of the Protestant and the Catholic, of how a Lutheran might learn from a Papist, of how the temperate zone might warm the north.  How food really is a sacrament.

Anyway, we know from the moment Babette comes to the austere, but grand old pious ladies to cook for them that she is something special.  When the ladies show her how to precisely prepare the mundane Danish meals of bread soup and soaked, smoked flounder, we know immediately that she is a great cook; after all she is Parisian, and an opera star has signified her as such.  But she modestly says not a word and learns the Danish names and follows faithfully the Danish recipes, as though she were an ingenue.  She works for nothing, having lost her family to the bloodshed in France, and what has she to live for but to do what she has to do and do it right.  And does she ever!

Babette's Feast is as heart-warming as a Disney tale would love to be.  It is as uplifting as a stirring Sousa march, and as satisfying as a seven-course meal at the Grand Hotel in Paris, France.  It starts like a novel from the nineteenth century, slow and studied, and before you know it, has captured your fancy.  Director Gabriel Axel unfolds the story with precision and a careful attention to detail, but ultimately with an invisible simplicity and economy.  What he is saying in the end, is what he has the general pronounce after the sensuous meal (which is quite a moral extravagance, perhaps even a sinfulness for the pious flock): ""Righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another.""

325602,5,6301216156,"First off, let me say that this is definitely a ""slow"" film by US standards.  However, if you appreciate terrific cinematography, and very intelligent but subtle humor, you will love this film.  It also goes  without saying that anyone that is a true connoisseur of food will also  ""relish"" this film.  The ending is bittersweet, where it touches  upon feelings about life in general, how to appreciate the little things,  how life is so precious, and how to deal with regret.",947808000,7,476,4.802469135802469
325603,5,6301216156,"This is a fascinating film. I'm appreciative of a large breadth of movies, but consider myself more of the <action/adventure> type rather that the <art film> type. The first time I watched it, I  felt that it  started out so slow, why am I still watching? And yet it was easy to keep  watching. It's a movie that I have watched probably 50 times over the last  3 years, and still enjoy immensely.
The original actor's voices are so  rich, the subtitled version is the only way to go. The dubbed version I saw  on television a short while ago was abysmal by comparison.",947116800,6,568,4.413461538461538
325604,5,6301216156,"This wonderful film, based on a short story by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), tells the story of what happens when a French refugee turns up at the house of the daughters of a (now deceased) protestant parson in  Denmark, and asks to be taken on as their cook and housekeeper. She  brightens their life, and when, on the occasion of what would have been the  100th birthday of the parson, she unexpectedly wins the French lottery she  decides to cook them a feast like they have never had before. But how will  the protestant sisters and their friends react to this extravagance? This  is not a film full of action, but of subtle humour and heavily masked deep  emotion. The feature film format gives the short story space to breathe and  the atmosphere to develop. It won the Oscar for best Foreign film. The copy  I have (and I assume this is the same) is in Danish with English  Subtitles.
Which makes me wonder why the illiterate ""Jillian from  NY"", who reviewed this wonderful film in November saw it in FRENCH  class.  I know people who have not found this film appealing, either  because they have an aversion to exotic food, or they only enjoy action  thrillers, but to claim ""babbette was portrayed as someone who when  she won the lottery was exploted (sic) for her francs"" seems absurd  given that she was the only one who knew what she was spending!",946252800,8,1359,4.549586776859504

7810866,5,6301216156,"This classic film, new to me, was a luxurious surprise, especially in light of its rather ascetic theme. But thats the fun of this storyline, with its metaphorical, sensual, sumptuous feast for the abstemious.  One character wonders aloud if  righteousness and bliss can coexist.  The story is adapted from Isak Dinesens novel, and its a good one.  As it goes, 2 older sisters, devout observers and practioners of a religious order started by their deceased pastor father, spend their days providing care and religion to the scant few remaining members of their sect. Any conflict, or not-okay thought, in the group is met often with much immediate prayerful song, or a big hallelujah on the part of one peacekeeper.  The setting is the remote western coast of Jutland, in 19th century Denmark. Each sister, as shown at the start of the film, had the opportunity of a romantic relationship, but both were duty-bound to dad. One stormy night, a wind and rain-ravaged Babette, pretty much collapses at their door (love that old melodramatic entrance).  But theres a serious subplot:  Babette is a French refugee, fleeing Paris following the murder of her husband and son. She presents a letter of introduction and makes clear that she wants no salary, just a safe place and to cook for the elderly pair. So its sounding pretty serious, but the humor is extraordinary and has a light-handed, measured subtlety that just makes you laugh out loud and hard.  Babette asks permission to prepare a French feast in celebration of the dead fathers 100th birthday.  While they agree, the stoic sisters suffer some angst, even tortured dreams, in anticipation of the gustatory decadence.  But desire prevails, and indulgent excesses are about to be secretly tolerated.  If I told you more, Id be spoiling. The acting is excellent across the board, Stephane Audran, a captivating Babette, Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer, winning, as the mature sisters.  Per Norgards music is just right and the operatic pieces beautiful. Gabriel Axels direction is exquisite, and Henning Kristiansens cinematography with Finn Henriksens editing, pure quality. There is considerable attention to atmospheric detail. amplifying time and place.  The film is a rare one and should be a part of any film lovers storehouse.",1524268800,,2292,5.112600536193029
