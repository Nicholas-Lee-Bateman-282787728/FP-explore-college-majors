Saaz is a sensitive portrayal of how fragile relationships, even the most real ones, can be and how they can cripple. Shabana's portrayal of the younger sister, subjected to torture by a selfish, scheming older sister deserves mention. Her fight for survival,the complexity of relationships she gets into, really tell a compelling tale. It doesn't end with that, her failed affair with a younger man, loved by her daughter,brings the focus back on relationships, this time, between mother and daughter. So eventually, one is left wondering at the complexity of life and an individual's struggle to establish her own identity. Very well told.",1304640000,,733,5.220338983050848
