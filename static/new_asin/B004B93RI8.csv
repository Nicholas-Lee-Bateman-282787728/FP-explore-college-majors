BRAGGING RIGHTS 2010

Spoilers

1. DANIEL BRYAN VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-what an incredible match up to kick things off with. These two put on a brilliant performance each in a show stealing match. This match is so well done with both working their respective styles and making them compliment one another. This match is back and forth near fall after near fall and the crowd is way into it. Bryan ends up winning this putting Raw up one to nothing but everybody won with this one.

2.[TAG TEAM TITLE]CODY RHODES & DREW MCINTYRE VS JOHN CENA & DAVID OTUNGA-this is of course is when Cena was forced into being a member of The Nexus. Honesty The Nexus was such a great storyline starting out but they let it just fade out. After Cody and Drew come out and claim there is no one worthy of a title shot Nexus leader Wade Barrett [who is great as a heel] introduces Otunga and Cena as the title contenders. Otunga started the match out but would soon tag Cena in, Cena then stayed in the rest of the match. Cena battles back and forth with the champs to finally sink in the STF to win the titles. Afterwards he attacks fellow Nexus partner Otunga before heading to the back.

Love Matt Striker here as they are hyping the next match, the guy cracks me up, just watch him as Cole is talking. I wish Striker would come back as a full time announcer.

3. GOLDUST VS TED DIBIASE-I have always been a fan of Goldust and I really hope they do more with him. His first run in the WWF was excellent as he was a great I-C champ in my opinion. Any way I liked the storyline going into this as Dust was finally being used again on a regular basis. Pretty good match here between these two with a good pace. Both come off well here but the big story was the ladies getting into it, this of course cost Goldust the match. Of course they also are to blame for Dibiase taking a final cut after the match.

4.[DIVA'S TITLE]LAYLA VS NATALYA-LayCool just cracks me up every time they do their thing, ""flawless"". Any way of course I am a huge Natalya fan as she is coming out of the Hart family. Love Natalya's shout out to her dad The British Bulldog [R.I.P.] as you will see. Natalya is all power and high impact moves while Layla is more about breaking her down with submissions and such. After McCool interferes Layla keeps the title within LayCool.

5.[BURIED ALIVE WORLD TITLE]KANE VS THE UNDERTAKER-this was by far Kane's best year in forever really. In fact this may have been Kane's best and strongest storyline since he debuted and was smashing everyone. Kane of course was on a great winning streak against his brother and was World Champ at this point. I was a fan of this storyline and saw the whole Paul Bearer thing coming but still it was fun. This match was just what it should have been, a fight. A match like this is supposed to be every where and more of a brawl than anything else. Plus these two put on a good match and it ended like a lot of these matches do, interference for the heel to win. Kane keeps the belt after Nexus attacks Taker costing him the win and title.

6.[ELIMINATION MATCH]THE MIZ, CM PUNK, JOHN MORRISON, R-TRUTH, EZEKIEL JACKSON, & SANTINO MARELLA VS BIG SHOW, EDGE, REY MYSTERIO, KOFI KINGSTON, JACK SWAGGER, ALBERTO DEL RIO, & TYLER REKS-now for the longest time the two brands have gone at it at one point during the year every year. Some times it has been at one of there shows or maybe at the Survivor Series all the way to this PPV made for it. I have actually liked this concept though some years it is executed better than others. I think each time it would be better if something was on the line each time other than brand pride. Like if you participate and win all surviving members will get a title shot on an episode of their respective show or something. Like these matches always are it was pure fun and full of action, never a dull moment. Also listen to the commentary on this match as the real heat between Striker and them is obvious here at points. There are all kinds of high spots here and some great stories being told like Mysterio and Del Rio in particular. Of course you know I love The Miz and CM Punk so it is great always going back to this and seeing them here. I also loved Alex taking that hit for Miz, still it is not enough as Edge and Rey survive after a great match.

7.[WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS WADE BARRETT-the main event of the night would see then leader of The Nexus Wade Barrett trying to take the title off of Randy Orton. John Cena who was now a tag champ was forced to be in Barrett's corner and was told that if Wade lost he would be fired. So the match kicks off and for what it is it is a pretty good match. I am a big fan of Barrett so you know I was cheering for him here, the action here is a bit of a brawl. The Nexus hit the ring at one point only to be attacked by Cena, and afterwards he gave Wade the AA. In doing so Randy was DQ'd and Cena kept his job since Barrett won.

Over all this was a good event that I enjoyed though not an epic event it did have some good matches. Special features include an interview with team Smackdown and Taker's last ride.",1313884800,2,5129,4.240532241555783
4314273,4,B004B93RI8,"Its time for me to review the 2nd annual Bragging Rights.
I would have to say that this Bragging Rights was slightly better than last years. It was predictable but good.

The first match was
Daniel Bryan vs Dolph Ziggler
Once again Daniel Bryan has a great ppv match. The fact that he won was very predictable but i really enjoyed the match. Winner Daniel Bryan Rating 8.5/10

The next match was the Tag Title Match
Dashing Cody Rhodes & Drew Mcintyre(c) vs John Cena and David Otunga
The match was decent. The outcome was predictable again. Winners John and David. Rating 6/10

Goldust vs Ted Dibiese
I did not care that much about the match but it was good. The outcome was really predictable. Winner Ted 6.5/10

World Title Match
Kane(c) vs Undertaker
It was a great matc. It was not predictable and the only complaint is that Nexus interfered and kind of ruined the match for me. Winner Kane. Rating 8/10

Divas Title Match
Layla(c) vs Natalya
Better than their Hell in a Cell 2010 but i did not care. Winner Layla. Rating 4/10

Team Raw vs Team Smackdown
Another great match. I was rooting team Smackdown and They won by eliminated The Miz. I preffer this more than last years because it was an elimination match. Winners Team Smackdown. Rating 9/10

Last Match was The WWE Championship Match
Randy Orton vs Wade Barret(W/John Cena)
Really good Match but i wish The Team Raw vs Team Smackdown was The Main event. Winner Randy Orton. Rating 7.5/10

Recap 3 Great Matches,1 Really good Match,and 3 Decent Matches.

4314274,3,B004B93RI8,"""Bragging Rights 2010"" isn't a bad way to kill time, but that's essentially what most of this PPV is: Killing Time.  It all moves along at a nice pace, and never becomes unbearable to watch.  It's just kind of...there...

1) Dolph Ziggler (Intercontinental champion)
v. Daniel Bryan (United States champion)
---This is the only match that really comes alive, and gets one totally into the PPV.  These two just work well together, in the style that fans of in-ring physicality will love.  Ziggler has his cocky persona down to a tee, and keeps coming up with new ways to show off his skills.  There's a reason that Daniel Bryan made a name for himself with indy-wrestling fans, and that's because he's a technician with a seemingly endless arsenal of submission holds and counters.  I didn't get to see the TV matches these men had together, and after watching this opener, I'm kicking myself in the butt for it.
""8.0 / 10""

-----------------------------------

2) WWE Tag Team Championships
'Dashing' Cody Rhodes & Drew McIntyre (champions)
v. David Otunga & John Cena
---I think viewers need to ask themselves two questions when they watch a WWE match: What is the point, and do I care?  The point of this match is to give John Cena something to do besides stand around like a helpless mope in the main event, and give audiences a chance to see the WWE's biggest star today.  Do I care?  Well, considering this was meant as a throwaway, and favored story over action, I did for the most part.  When assigning numbers to score these kinds of matches, how fair can one be?  The tag titles contest is basically David Otunga is too cocky and inexperienced to put up a decent fight, and Cena has to do most of the work to win the belts.  I wasn't bored, but I'll admit that the in-ring action isn't anything to brag about.
""5.5 / 10""

-----------------------------------

3) Ted DiBiase (w/ Maryse) v. Goldust (w/ Aksana)
---The thought that kept running through my mind with this bonus match is, ""Who cares?""  Something just didn't click here.  These two men are very talented performers.  Maryse is very pleasing to the eye, while Aksana has a cute personality.  I guess what happened was I didn't see a whole lot of rhyme or reason to the match itself.  It's just a ""your-turn-my-turn"" bunch of moves, with not much of an interesting story going on here.  If you just want to see two wrestlers have a simple match, then this one might work for you.  I just stopped caring, and was glad when it was over.
""4.5 / 10""

-----------------------------------

4) Divas Championship
Layla (co-champion - w/ Michelle McCool) v. Natalya
---Let me first acknowledge that I haven't seen Natalya's previous encounters with Layla or Michelle McCool yet.  First, the two co-champions trashtalk their way to the ring, which I always find hilarious about these self-serving divas.  Natalya, on the other hand, does all her talking in the ring, and quite well, in my opinion.  The whole match moves along at a quick pace, leaving little time to get too bored.  Like most Divas matches this year, I don't really have much to say.  Nothing was awful, but I guess considering the love-to-hate charmisa from Team Lay-Cool and physical talents of Natalya, I expected something more.  This was the 2nd time this rivalry made it to PPV, and it deserved to make a stronger impression.
""5.5 / 10""

-----------------------------------

5) Buried Alive Match - World Heavyweight Championship
The Undertaker v. Kane (champion)
---It seems that most people love the fact that these two ""brothers"" it out all over the arena, and while I have to say it's one of the better crowd slugfests I've seen, I wish there was some more brutality.  Even with the TV-PG rating, Kane & Taker could've done more here.  They barely even use the ring; even though that's not the point, I got tired of the fistfight long before Taker & Kane tried something else.  The ending is something I've a few times already with Taker's PPV Buried Alive Matches.  Perhaps it will lead to some compelling TV, but I was underwhelmed.  Now, this isn't a bad match, and the Taker/Kane rivalry has been a good story.  But ask yourself, if two other men had done the exact same thing, would you care?
""6.0 / 10""
-----------------------------------

6) Bragging Rights - Elimination Match
TEAM RAW: (The Miz, CM Punk, John Morrison,
Ezekiel Jackson, Santino Marella, R-Truth, & Sheamus)
VS.
TEAM SMACKDOWN: (Big Show, Rey Mysterio, Jack Swagger,
Tyler Reks, Alberto Del Rio, Kofi Kingston, & Edge)
---Finally, this PPV comes back to life.  Although I kinda scoff that there was already a 7-on-7 Elimination Match at ""SummerSlam"" (and that ""Survivor Series"" had a 5-on-5), this is better than last year's interbrand Bragging Rights Match, for the most part.  The Elimination-style allows for a more logical ending, and this 2010 showcase showed off the talent a lot more than the 2009 contest.  What surprised me is that even though each wrestlers got a chance to look good, the eliminations were rather sudden.  Edge, for example, takes out 3 opponents in very quick fashion.  Larger athletes like Jackson or Tyler Reks make an impression, which surprising how the most sudden counter puts them out of business.  The surprises are hit-and-miss.  Edge's dominance and The Miz's lack of participation were disappointing, yet I loved Alberto Del Rio's story from start to finish.  Everyone is going to have a different opinion on what's good or bad with these kinds of matches.  To me, I throughly enjoyed this match, and was glad to see the diverse talents from Raw and SmackDown get to mix it up.
""7.0 / 10""

-----------------------------------

7) WWE Championship
Wade Barrett (w/ John Cena - Fired If Barrett Loses)
v. Randy Orton (WWE champion)
---This match will be remembered for the storyline surrounding John Cena more than anything else, and rightfully so.  There's really not much to say beyond Cena's involvement with how the main event plays out.  Barrett and Orton delivered the most basic kind of main event you could ask for.  It's a lot of punching and kicking, with a few longer submission holds and signature moves thrown in.  I really can't understand why anyone thinks Randy Orton should be a hero, because his offense is based around his cold demeanor and disregard for anyone else.  Wade Barrett is new to the WWE, but he needs to come up with something fresh before this Nexus storyline dies out.  In movie terms, the whole piece is well-acted in spite of being miscast.  John Cena and Barrett have a terrific storyline here, and their dynamic is the best thing about this match.  I wasn't bored with the match, espcially with the clever ending.  But I think years from now, this main event will be remembered for having a storyline that was better than the sum of its parts.  This chapter is part of a good storyline, but it's sad that the best parts happened on Monday Night Raw, leaving the PPV broadcast to pick up the pieces.
""6.0 / 10""

-----------------------------------

OVERALL
I've trashed ""Bragging Rights 2010"" quite a bit.  Would it surprise me to tell you that I still enjoyed it, regardless of my quibbles?  I'm being dismissive because I like the PPV, but don't think anyone else will really dig it beyond a couple above-average matches.  The two main events had great TV buildup, but were merely average when the PPV went on the air.  I give big props to the WWE for giving us the brand-vs-brand feeling that most WWE TV programming lacks, but I have to admit that I like the characters more than the in-ring action on this particular night.",1292284800,,7613,4.78680981595092
4314275,3,B004B93RI8,"Daniel Bryan (RAW) vs. Dolph Ziggler (SmackDown) - For the second year in a row, the holders of the top midcard titles (U.S. for Bryan & I.C. for Dolph) meet in the opening match. Dolph dominated the first half of this match by constantly going to the outside breaking momentum whenever Daniel Bryan was building it while working over Bryan's neck with a snapmare & various sleeper-like submission holds. Bryan was able to come back with various kicks including a missle dropkick from the top rope. Dolph was able to reverse a suplex from the top into on a bodyblock while later both men attempted a flying crossbody block only to end up crashing into each other followed by a heavy series of counters into near falls with Dolph's ego causing him to make the one mistake opening that Bryan needed. This was an excellent competitive match that was so fun that I didn't mind that that we were able to get it two more times on TV in the same week.

WWE Tag Team Champions Drew McIntyre & Cody Rhodes (SmackDown) vs. John Cena & David Otunga (RAW) - This was a match made last minute thanks to the RAW General Manager & Nexus leader Wade Barrett. Don't let the title fool you here as this was a glorifed handicap match as Cena refused to tag out to Otunga throughout the match. Eventhough Cody was able to do a unique one arm camel clutch submission, this was mostly a dominate performance by Cena leading to him winning the tag team titles with Otunga...but it was the aftermath that really showed the phrase ""your either Nexus or your against us"" doesn't apply all the time.

Goldust vs. Ted Dibiase - Another match that was added last minute that was a solid encounter but nothing special past both of their ladies (Goldust's NXT rookie Aksana & Dibiase's valet Maryse) getting into it during & after the match but this came off more as a way to plug the upcoming wedding between Goldust & Aksana on NXT more than anything else.
As a side note for those who like historical trivia, rewind back to this same time period 20 years ago & their fathers were feuding in WWE as well.

Divas Champion Layla (SmackDown) vs. Natayla (RAW) - With McCool defending the title the previous month, it was Layla's turn. Natayla showcased her power throughout the match by doing the ""British Bulldog"" delayed vertical suplex while ramming McCool spinefirst into the rail on the outside warning her to stay out of the match. Layla did some nice moves here in this match by using her legs to do a variation of a cruifix along with a body sissors submission before Natayla once again had the numbers work against her in favor of LayCool. This was short but at least entertaining.

Buried Alive Match: World Champion Kane vs. Undertaker - Taker jumped this match off by attacking Kane in the isle & taking the fight throughout the crowd & ringside causing Kane to resort to using a chair to gain an advantage. Kane kept trying to put Taker down including 3 back to back to back chokeslams only for Taker to keep sitting up. They were slugging it out with hand punches near the grave before Taker was able to choke out Kane with the Hell's Gate before going after Paul Bearer causing Nexus to get involved & assist Kane getting the third straight victory over his brother. I personally think this was the best match of out their trilogy as this match to be a brawl that went all over the place instead of the previous two matches where it was more focused on in ring action with both men are limited to at this stage in their careers.

Elimination Match: Big Show, Rey Mysterio, Edge, Kofi Kingston, Alberto Del Rio, Jack Swagger, Tyler Reks (SmackDown) vs. The Miz, C.M. Punk, Sheamus, R-Truth, Santino Marella, John Morrison, Ezekiel Jackson (RAW) - As expected with a multiman match under these type of rules, this was a fun match full of action & various highlights such as giving a strong showcasing to the two ""wildcards"" in Reks & Jackson, the issues between Mysterio & Del Rio, the showdown between Big Show & Sheamus, when it got down to the final 5 members, Alex Riley getting involved, and the celebration at the announce table afterwards. This was better than the match the previous year as most of everyone here had a chance to be showcased.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Wade Barrett - John Cena was forced to be in Wade Barrett's corner for this match with the stipulation put on Cena by Barrett that if he was to lose this match then Cena would be fired. This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as everything in this match was more focused on what Cena was going to do more than anything else as the action in the ring never left ""first gear"" to the point where the crowd died out past a brief ""fire Cena"" chant. There were times where Orton would go to the outside & pass right by Cena causing Barrett to go outside & confront Cena about not doing anything. This only picked up when Nexus came to ringside causing Cena to take actions to make sure Barrett didn't lose the match to save his job. Again, this was all about the story involving Cena more than anything else.

So in the end, there really wasn't a bad match on here with the opening match, Buried Alive, and the elimination match being the strongest matches here while the undercard matches were solid so this is an event I would suggest taking a look at.",1288915200,7,5323,4.504140786749482
4314276,4,B004B93RI8,"The opening bout between US Champion Daniel Bryan & IC Champion Dolph Ziggler was a high-flying,high-tech showstealer. The Tag Team Championship match was average at best. The Million Dollar Championship match Between Ted DiBiase & Goldust was a good match with many good moves to boot. The Divas title match between Natalya & Layla was not great but pretty good with a bad ending to ruin it. The Buried Alive match for the World's title between The Undertaker & Kane was a pretty good/solid brawl with a weird ending of the Nexus coming out and attacking The Undertaker for no good reason. The 14 man tag team elimation match between Team Smackdown & Team Raw was a good match with nice individual performances to boot. The WWE title match between Randy Orton & Wade Barrett was not by far a great match but still pretty solid with DQ ending to ruin it. Overall,good show with Ziggler vs Bryan & The 14 man tag team elimation match bring the best bouts of the night. I give this DVD a 7 out of 10.",1287964800,,998,4.489010989010989
4314277,1,B004B93RI8,"Not much to brag about on this show.  They realized nobody was going to buy this show, so they gave  practically no effort whatsoever.  The opener was great, but my god did this show go downhill from there.  Let me tell you, there were points in this show where I was literally having a hard time keeping my eyes open.  To make things even worse, the crowd was completely, and I mean EERILY dead quiet for the vast majority of the show.  Granted, there wasn't much to cheer about, but this was still the worst WWE ppv crowd I've seen in a long time.  A truly terrible show, easily the worst wwe ppv of the year, with many terrible finishes after many less than good matches.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1.  Dolph Ziggler (IC Champ) w/ Vickie Guerrero vs. Daniel Bryan (U.S. Champ)

This was billed as a champion vs. champion match but no titles were on the line.  Really good match.  They worked a Japanese style match, with good chain wrestling at the start, building the match slowly, and then doing a ton of near falls and false finishes at the end.  Finish came when Ziggler lost his cool and started taunting and slapping Bryan, and Bryan put him in the Lebell lock for the clean submission.  Best match by far on the show, and if you actually rent this show or, heaven forbid, buy it, watch this match.  ***3/4

After the match was over, Vickie and Dolph started arguing with the ref for some reason, and the ref proceeded to eject them: after the match...Huh?

2.  Tag Team Championship Match
Cody Rhodes (c) & Drew McIntyre (c) vs. John Cena & David Otunga

Rhodes and McIntyre cut a promo saying that everyone in the back was scared to face them.  Wade Barrett came out and said he had two people who weren't afraid.  Unfortunately they were David Otunga and John Cena.  At least this was different.  Not much of a match.  Cena worked pretty much the entire thing, which I won't complain about because when Otunga was in there it was cringeworthy.  Crowd was completely dead except for a loud ""CENA SUCKS!"" chant at one point.  Cena sold for a while while Rhodes and McIntyre worked him over, then he made his comeback and submitted Rhodes with the STF.  *1/2

After the match, Otunga reacted as if he'd just won the titles himself, so Cena just gave him an attitude adjustment.

3.  Goldust w/ Aksana vs. Ted Dibiase w/ Maryse

They didn't make it clear but I don't think the stolen Million Dollar Belt was on the line here.  Who cares?  Certainly not the people producing this show.  They actually had a pretty good little match, in fact I'd even say it was the second best match on the show, but the crowd was dead.  I mean, COMATOSE.  The girls on the outside started brawling, which the crowd, shockingly, reacted to.  Then Maryse threw Aksana in the ring, which distracted Goldust long enough for Ted to hit a DDT for the win.  Yes, a DDT.  After the match, Aksana grabbed the belt, looked like she was going to kiss Ted, but Goldust came up from behind and beat up Ted.  So yes, they tricked Ted and Goldust still has the belt.  Someone paid $54.95 to see this.  **1/4

4.  Women's Championship Match
Layla (c) w/ Michelle McCool vs. Natalya

Not much to say about this one.  It was pretty horrible, and then the ref got distracted and Michelle kicked Natalya in the head allowing Layla to get the win.  You could hear crickets chirping during this match.  1/2*

5.  World Heavyweight Championship Buried Alive Match
Kane (c) w/ Paul Bearer vs. Undertaker

You are not allowed to bleed on a PG show, but you can bury someone alive.  Interesting.  Match was exactly what you'd expect from these two.  They brawled in the crowd for a long time with Undertaker getting the upper hand, then Kane hit Taker with some weak chair shots.  Kane hit two straight chokeslams and carried Taker towards the grave.  Taker was about to win after he choked out Kane with the hell's gate, but Nexus ran out (for some completely inexplicable reason) and beat up undertaker and threw him in the grave.  Kane then used his powers to telepathically order the bulldozer that was at the gravesite to dump dirt in the grave, so he is your winner.  Better than their horrendous Hell in a Cell match, but still well below the standards of any World Heavyweight Championship match.  *3/4

6.  Bragging Rights Tam Team Match
Team Raw (The Miz, CM Punk, Ezekial Jackson, Sheamus, R-Truth, John Morrison, & Santino Marella)
vs.
Team Smackdown (Big Show, Edge, Rey Mysterio, Alberto Del Rio, Tyler Reks, Kofi Kingston, & Jack Swagger)

One quick question: why are they doing another big elimination match when the next ppv is Survivor Series?  In case you were wondering, they actually wrestled the whole match wearing their raw and smackdown t-shirts.  I cannot even tell you how tacky and low rent this looked.  Match was not good at all, and the crowd did not care one iota untill the last 2 minutes or so, and this match was insufferably long.  Santino got eliminated straight away, which begs the question why he was even in this to begin with.  Is their roster that bad?  Some guys got eliminated with some moves.  I was falling asleep.  Big Show got himself counted out while he beat up Sheamus on the outside, so he looked like a complete bafoon.  Well, they do have his movie coming out, and his character in the movie is a bafoon.  Alberto beat up Rey on the outside, and they pretended like Rey was injured.  Of course, he came back later in the match and made his superman comeback.  This included horribly botching a springboard splash onto Ezekial Jackson.  Rey slipped on the top rope and landed side first onto Zeke's legs.  Zeke then proceeded to kick out, but the ref counted three anyway.  The crowd, which was FINALLY starting to get into the match, died a death.  It came down to Edge and Mysterio against Miz.  Need I say more?  Edge and Rey were the sole survivors.  *3/4

7.  WWE Championship Match
Randy Orton (c) vs. Wade Barrett w/ John Cena

This show desperately needed a great main event to save it.  This was not even close to being that main event.  They worked the match around John Cena just being on the outside.  You could hear a pin drop in the crowd they were so dead.  The match was very boring.  Wade worked over Orton for a while, and then Orton made his usual comeback to a shockingly little amount of heat.  The ref got bumped.  Nexus ran in and beat up Orton.  Cena then ran in and beat up Nexus, because you see, if the ref awoke and saw this, Barrett would be dq'd and Cena would get fired.  Orton then beat up Barrett some more, and was about to hit the RKO when Cena came in and hit the attitude adjustment on Barrett.  So Barrett wins by dq, but because Barrett won the match, Cena doesn't get fired.  He outsmarted him, you see.  Orton responded by hitting Cena with an RKO.  Then he celebrated.  Then he hit Barrett with an RKO.  Then he celebrated some more.  Then the show went off the air.  *1/2

This was one of the most boring WWE ppvs I've seen in a long time.  There was absolutely nothing of any note whatsoever on this show.  Do not buy this.  If you really want to see it, rent it and watch the opener.  Do not watch anything else, it is a waste of your time.  Easily the worst wwe ppv of the year thus far.",1287964800,,7269,4.438116932422171
