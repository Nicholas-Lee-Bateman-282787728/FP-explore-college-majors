2546190,5,B000EYA084,"BOZ became my 20 month old daughter's new favorite after she watched the video only once...and mine too!  After that, all she asks to see is BOZ.

We love the valuable teaching lessons, the 11 upbeat, catchy songs, and the positive attitudes of all the characters throughout the episodes.  I especially like the lessons of God's love and exploring His creation.  One of the songs teaching about colors is, ""God's Green Earth Is Not Just Green"".  We also like that the characters pray before their meals and before they go to bed at night.

One thing I especially like, is that the video plays for a LONG time.  After playing the three episodes, it goes into the trailers, and then automatically plays from the beginning again.

Boz is a lovable character, and not at all like Barney (who, in my opinion is really annoying).  I highly recommend this video, and even more so, the ""Colors & Shapes"" video.",1148083200,,902,4.658227848101266
2546191,5,B000EYA084,"My 2 yr old LOVES Boz!  They are superb for providing entertainment in a calm style while instilling great values and teaching the basics (colors, shapes, numbers) at the same time.",1145923200,2,181,4.838709677419355
2546192,4,B000EYA084,"**UPDATE** (Aug. 19, 2006) My intention wasn't to down the series or be ""mean spirited"" I do appreciate the series, and yes, I notice that the children pray. I still reccommend this series. I, myself, was a child who loved to watch movies over and over like my son does now. He constantly watches Thomas the train, and all that, and he is currently on a ""Veggie Tales"" kick, which I NEVER get tired of. I still watch the same favorite movies of mine frequently as well.

I do like Boz. I later found out that Boz, indeed, was fashioned after Barney by people who had created/worked with Barney previously. So, while Boz isn't Barney himself, he does have some similar traits and demeanors.... not that that's bad, mind you.

If this review has been perceived negatively, I would like to clarify that it wasn't my intention, and I truly do support this series. My son has actually watched it a few more times and has taken a better liking to it as well.

***

This one is just as good, if not better, than the colors and shapes one. (See my review of that one) My review of that one is about the same as this one.

I likes these DVDs, but like I explained in my other review, they need to tone it down a tad and make it more realistic. They don't need to pour on the Barney type fun in order for the child to enjoy it. In fact, too much of that and they either tire themselves out after they go nuts over it, or they get bored with it (like my son currently is right now, as he is watching it).

These DVDs are worth getting, and the kids will like it. But obviously, parents will only be able to endure so much before they say, ""Ok, that's enough for now. We'll watch it later after my headache is gone."" The company needs to keep that in mind and adjust their product accordingly.",1144368000,6,1781,4.238938053097345
2546193,5,B000EYA084,My two year old loves it. They speak so nice to each other and teaches kindness. They have a great family unit in this dvd that kids can relate to.

2546194,4,B000EYA084,"Boz is wonderful for the younger set. The show promotes good character, treating other people well, etc. (One thing I don't care fot though is an element all-too-prevalent in many shows and commercial: the dim-witted dad. In one scene, he's too incompetant to toss a piece of trash in the trash can, and his wife pushes him out of the way showing him up. Dad is just a couple of steps behind everyone. I want my kids to look up to their dad. Research shows that dad is a big factor in how kids turn out, so let's build him up and encourage admiration and respect, not head-shaking.)
Overall, well-done and better than a lot of what's out there.",1426291200,,644,4.420168067226891

2546196,5,B000EYA084,"We have taught our daughter to pray every night before bed, but these BOZ shows have encouraged her to want to pray.  Now she asks us to pray (and she doesn't know very many words yet) because they do on ""BOZ Bear.""  With her one word sentences she tells us lots of good things she has learned from BOZ and the kids in the show.  Ever since she started watching it once every couple days she has fallen asleep well at naptime and bedtime because that's what they do in ""BOZ Bear.""  Prior to this she has cried and fidgeted off and on for hours in bed.  We are very thankful for this quality series that teaches kids to use their imagination and help others all because God loves them.  It is the best thing we've found to show our children, and we're pretty careful about ever using the TV.",1398470400,,790,4.233333333333333

2546206,5,B000EYA084,"Both my kids (ages 3.5 years and 23 months) request to watch Boz all the time!  My favorite thing about this series is the positive example set by all the characters in the show!  Finally something I can let my kids watch without worrying they will see/hear something that I need to explain or correct.  Many ""kid shows"" out there display plenty of behavior that I don't want my kids imitating or thinking is acceptable, such as disrespect, negative or rude attitude, defiance, teasing others, selfishness, etc (my kids do enough of these without the media's influence).  The parents in the show are supportive and capable (rather than clueless like in other shows), and the children are respectful, kind, helpful, encouraging, and easily convinced to change their attitude when they start to get down about something.  This is the kind of behavior I want my kids mimicking.

Sure, the show is cheesy and some of the songs can get old, but I would take that a million times over disrespectful kids, inept parents, crude humor, or scary scenes that I see in most other kid shows!  We have ""Friends and Helpers"" and also ""Bananas and Bubbles,"" and this one is the less cheesy of the two.  If you are very conscious and careful about what your kids are exposed to, then get this!  You won't be disappointed!",1357084800,,1304,4.709251101321586

2546210,2,B000EYA084,"I was hoping to be able to watch this with my two-year old and have some-what of a devotional: be able to talk about who God is, how we can please Him and why...something. Instead, we were presented with a few cutesy songs, one of which was called ""read a book"" or something to that extent, some sad attempts of humor (Boz and child making silly faces), and some very basic Christian-like culture references. I say ""Christian-like"" because we are shown two children who are doing ""good things"" to help others, and recite a prayer at the end of the day. Beside that, there is nothing different between this movie and say, Barney (which was created by the same director by the way). I understand that the intended audience is 2-5 year olds so I wasn't expecting deep theological topics, but I was hoping for something that would leave my child with a basic curiosity about God. I can't quite put my finger on what is missing from this...what would make it better. If I had to summerize, I'd say it just failed to be life-changing, the way I believe Christian material should be.",1336608000,,1076,4.551546391752577
2546211,5,B000EYA084,"My grandkids love to watch BOZ.  From the littlest ones to the 6 year old, they all love him.  He teaches what a good friend is and that we should be helpers to our parents, grandparents and friends.  You can't go wrong buying this DVD.",1312416000,,236,4.2
2546212,5,B000EYA084,"My 3-year-old daughter loves this video. She asks for it a lot. I love that the songs do not drive me crazy like some children's programs do. There are good lessons about sharing and doing for others. While it's not ""deep,"" it IS for young kids, and my daughter mimicked the prayers that they kids say at the end of each episode. I love that she wants to watch it, and it beats most of what I've seen for kids.",1303171200,,410,4.1375
2546213,5,B000EYA084,"This particular Boz video is probably the best of them all. In ""Thank you God for Friends and Helpers"" the theme is helping others who are in need. I especially appreciate the episode where the children are supposed to go to the county fair; their grandmother gets hurt and is therefore unable to get her yard chores done (she needs help).

At first, when their mother (children are Gracie and Drew) informs them they cannot go to the fair because their grandmother needs help, they try to get out of it so they can still go to the fair. Their attitude is not horrible, but they are not cheerful in doing what is right (this might be the best lesson learned). What I like about the lesson is that they are not corrected for some outrageous temper tantrum (which many parents allow their children to do) but for simply not having a cheerful attitude Boz corrects and instructs them (in real life it is the parents, but oh-well). So Boz helps the children have fun while helping their grandmother. He improves their attitude where they enjoyed doing the right thing instead of drudgingly doing their required task.

Here are some great points to mention about the Boz series:

The character's attitudes are always excellent toward one another. The children show respect for each other and reverence their parents. Unlike almost every children's cartoon or other video where people insult one another and have a bad attitude (in general), the Boz series displays the proper attitude that children should have. They show that a good attitude, love and respect for others, etc. is what is normal. No, it is not normal for your children to have a poor attitude, NEVER. Do not excuse your child's behavior, but rather properly train him (sorry for the side note but I felt it is important to note). The Boz series will reinforce you faithfully and consistently training your children to have a good attitude at all times. I have never seen even a Christian children's series that so successfully and uncompromisingly sticks to these values.

The Baxter family always remember to thank God at the end of each day/episode which is extremely important.

No, this video series is not perfect and there are things I would have done differently (for sure) but this is a good starting point to go in the right direction. I wish their were videos like this for older children that promote character qualities such as bravery, honor, loyalty, courage, dignity (character of a man of God that are too often missing from Christian children's videos).

So overall, I give a 5 star rating because its the best I've seen in the Christian children's market in DVD cartoons.",1261785600,,2651,4.777292576419214
2546214,5,B000EYA084,"I believe this is is the first DVD released in the BOZ the green bear series (we got every single BOZ DVD that was released up to date).  I heard it discussed on a Christian radion talk show and ordered it to check out.  I introduced it to my son back there when he was only 10 month old and it surely got his attention.  He is 4 now and his brother is 2, but they both still love watching the BOZ DVDs relentlessly (if we allow, they would not mind watch them every day).  Their friends and older cousins love watching these too.  All the DVDs still capture their attention and interest.  I think these are the safest, best, most wonderful DVDs ever made for kids.  They have beautiful and colorful animation with few characters but with good stories/episode, fun and interesting adventures/settings, excellent moral and religious values and lessons, good music.  I highly recommend all the DVDs in the series for kids age 1+.  I hope they will continue to make more DVDs like these.",1247875200,,984,4.5141242937853105
2546215,5,B000EYA084,"My wife found out about Boz at her local MOPS group and after our first DVD, we were hooked.  Our son at only 18 months just loved it and always asks for it.  Now at 2, it's still his favorite.  We now have every Boz DVD made and key an eye out for the new ones.

As parents, we really like the values portrayed (concepts of friends, family, forgiveness, honesty, sharing, etc.) in a fun and clear way that's enjoyable for pre-schoolers across a wider age group.

We have all of the Disney movies that you can imagine, but many of them are still too scarey for younger viewers.  You don't realize how bad they all started off until you think about your 2 year old watching them (typical theme of overcoming adversity starts with someone killing the mother, ala Bambi or Fox & Hound, or the kitten or puppies getting tossed in a sack out of a moving car, etc).  While G rated, the concepts are still a bit much for younger viewers, so it will be a while before we move up to Disney movies.

So for now, we are estatic about the entire Boz series of DVDs and highly recommend them.

Caveat - these are Christian based videos.  No specific denomination are ever mentioned.  No church scenes and no mention of attending any kind of services, but there is a prayer in every episode (in a family setting while tucking the kids in for bed or at dinner) and blatant use of the G-o-d word.  While the values taught still transcend specific religious beliefs, if you are offended by religious messages and prayer, these will not be for you.",1196121600,,1530,4.386524822695035
2546216,3,B000EYA084,"Pros:I really like the animation of these videos.  The Christian family values are hard to find too.

Cons:The main character has to be the same voice that they used for Barney.  He does the same giggle and over the top enthusiasm in most of the characters.  I am not a Barney fan, so the voice is very irritating to me.  This is my main hang up with the series.  These are not movies I would want to watch again and again for these reasons.

If you like Barney than you will love these. Same creators and voice.",1194912000,2,512,4.216494845360825
2546217,3,B000EYA084,"All of these reviews are true. However, if you are looking for a good christian video with some Biblical content, you won't find it here. Rather than referring to God's Word as a tool to live your life, Boz relies on cute sayings like ""make lemonade when life hands you lemons"". It is a ton better than most cartoons out there, but it drops the ball when it comes to the opportunity to spread the Gospel.",1183680000,5,404,4.328947368421052
2546218,5,B000EYA084,My two year old daughter loves this DVD - we got colors and shapes as a gift and she liked that - this one she likes even better!,1179100800,,129,3.642857142857143
2546219,5,B000EYA084,"As a mom, my favorite part of this video is when Drew and Gracie pray over their meal and before bedtime.  My then-two-year-old son had this prayer memorized after only the second or third time watching it.  It goes like this:

Thank you God as this day ends

For my family and my friends

Taking time to sit and pray

Thank you God for this great day

I love helping Mommy and Daddy

And Boz

And the clothes and toys we're too big for

Will make other kids happy

Amen.

So now my son prays this exact prayer when he eats and goes to sleep.  It is adorable.

Really, the whole video is fantastic.  Think high-quality computer animation coupled with cute songs, adorable characters, and great values.  Drew and Gracie are truly inspriational for any child and I believe they have actually inspired my son to be more helpful and  considerate.

The other thing that stands out about, not only Friends and Helpers, but also the entire Boz series, is that it is set within the context of a loving, warm Christian family.  If you think about all the great kids' shows, both Christian and non-Christian, none that I can recall are set within the context of a nuclear family.  So that aspect of Boz adds an entirely new dimension for kids to relate to.

What can I say?  We're smitten!  Boz is sure to be around for a long time with many more DVDs and products to come.  You can't lose with any Boz products!  Truly inspirational for children, high quality, and fun.",1167955200,11,1460,4.4393939393939394
2546220,5,B000EYA084,"My mother bought this DVD for our 23-month-old son. I thought it looked pretty cheesey so I wasn't very enthused about showing it to him. As we all have experienced, sometimes when a toy/movie/book is marketed as being a ""Christian"" alternative, the quality isn't as high as ""mainstream"" media.

However, my son has LOVED this DVD. We have only had it for about a month now, but have watched it countless times. It does have ELEVEN different songs on it, which my son really loves and tries to sing along with.

Last week we took the DVD to church with us and used it during children's church for kids aged 6 and under. Every child seemed to enjoy it, even though I was afraid that the 6 year olds would feel it was beneath them.

That being said, the characters do pray to God (who loves them) and try to be good neighbors, friends, children, etc, but that is about the extent of the theology in this DVD. I can't recall any mention of Jesus or any thing beyond the idea of ""being good"" or ""doing good"".

All in all, this is a good DVD, but the only thing that makes it ""Christian"" is a few sentances of prayers and songs about God loving us.",1160352000,6,1143,4.3023255813953485
2546221,5,B000EYA084,"I purchased this DVD primarily for my 18 month old son.  I thought he would enjoy it as he grew older if it was too advanced for him now.  Turns out that both he and my 5 year old son love the videos and ask for it daily!

The storyline is centered around the relationship between a large green bear who lives next door to 4 year old twin brother and sister and their mother and father.  I appreciate the interaction between the parents, grandparents, and twins as well.  Sadly, the family unit has been demeaned in mainstream children's shows.  Either the parents are missing entirely (Barney, Out of the Box, etc.) or, for older kids' shows, the parents are depicted as stupid or detached (Jimmy Neutron, Fairly Odd Parents, etc.).  This series does an excellent job of depicting balanced, loving, supportive parents who are also positive authority figures in the twins lives.

Boz is the bear's name.  He is very upbeat, energetic, and positive.  Some parents might find this annoyingly so, but, in my opinion, the video is designed for preschool aged children and it certainly seems to appeal to my children very much.  My 5 year old watches the videos with a sweet smile (no kidding!) on his face as he experiences the show with them.  By the way, my son has seen (and enjoyed) Sponge Bob and Jimmy Neutron, yet he asks for Boz more than anything else.

The value based educational stories are very sweet and well done.  This is a Christian video, so there are references to God and faith.  The references to God are loving and appropriately interspersed throughout the stories.  The subtle references are nice.  My son loved finding the cross in the twins' bedroom.  The faith references are balanced and (in my opinion) realistic.  For instance, along with the cross on their bedroom wall, there are pictures that the children have drawn of super heroes.  The focus is not exceedingly on God, instead God is viewed as a normal part of a normal life and referred to at appropriate moments.  The primary focus of the inclusion of God is to reinforce how much God loves us.

As for the music, I'll warn you, the songs are very catchy.  I catch myself singing them throughout the day whether I want to or not!  My 5 year old has found them easy to learn and sing along with too.  The music has a full, professional sound.

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the video.  The animation is similar to that used in Disney's ""Monsters, Inc.""  It is well done.  The body movements and facial expressions are appropriate and quite realistic.

Overall, I am pleased with the videos.  I would recommend them to any conscientious parent who is interested in their child developing a positive view of God and faith while learning and being entertained in the process.",1153612800,22,2771,4.651546391752578
