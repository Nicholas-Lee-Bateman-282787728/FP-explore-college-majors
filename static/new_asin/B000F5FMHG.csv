2552648,5,B000F5FMHG,"this dvd is a delightful presentation of a fluid and yes, radiant, practice of yoga. it is less an instructional dvd and more an offering of yoga practice--strong, serene, and beautiful.

the practice is divided into sequences based on the four seasons plus a lunar segment. creation of the sequences is credited to two male instructors we don't see on the dvd. one of three graceful and beautiful yoginis, instructors in their own right, performs each segment. the cues are few, but accurate, and narrated by a fourth woman with a voice made of honey, against lovely atmospheric music. both the narration and score seemed to be weaved through the practice and are an integral part of it without being in the least bit intrusive. the set is simple and warm looking--either a bare room with wood floors and white walls or a studio with wood floors and olive backdrop. the lunar segment has tealight candles encircling the practice space. the photography is rich and inviting. the end result is actually a yoga film--a delight to practice to be sure, but also a joy just to watch or even listen to. you really can learn from watching these women go through the practice--they are strong and know their stuff, and you can clearly see them consciously place themselves in and work with each pose.

as for style, this is a strong vinyasa practice, building from basic to more challenging asanas, all interlaced with vinyasas (flowing sequence based on plank, upward dog, and downward dog between major asanas). vinyasas are particularly prominent in the summer and autumn sequences, but are also present in the others, in subtler form. none of the poses are modified or explained in much detail, so if you are beginner or prefer precise instruction on breathing, alignment, and movement into and out of the poses, this is not the dvd for you. the cues are more in the nature of reminders than instruction. for practitioners with a foundation in the asanas, however, it is a great complement to yoga instruction from live teachers and other more alignment focused dvds. that incredible voice accompanies you unobtrusively through a gorgeous looking, creatively designed, deeply satisfying practice. intermediate practitioners will find a good mix of familiar poses to work oneself into more deeply and more challenging poses to stretch the boundaries of practice. advanced yogins will welcome a moving meditation practice more in line with their level than the norm.

i am an intermediate practitioner, and find the practice itself powerful and challenging but not overly taxing. some poses are currently beyond my reach, but i appreciate the opportunity to either work towards them or modify them as i have been taught elsewhere, depending on where i am that day. the warming repetition of vinyasas leaves my muscles far more flexible and supple than more static practices, so i am able to work more deeply into the backbends and forward bends of the winter and lunar segments. when doing the full practice, i end up feeling as though someone had buttered my muscles and gently but deeply massaged my spine. i also like the option to do one or two segments (especially the spring and lunar sequences) if i lack time or want to add them to my personal practice sequences. my quibbles: you can select any one or all of the segments, but cannot string them together to form a customized practice. the winter segment has a short Shavasana, and the lunar segment a longer one, so you are on your own if you want to do just one of the others, but this is hardly a tragedy. while i am fine with the minimalist voiceover cuing, it is sometimes out of sync with the actual practice, or even just plain missing. this should have been attended to more carefully. overall a great addition to a personal yoga dvd library.

2552649,5,B000F5FMHG,"As a yoga practitioner who frequently does yoga at home, solo and with friends, I am always looking for NEW ""classes"" in which to participate.  YOGA RADIANCE is an excellently narrated program.  The narrator has such a calm, lovely voice and the cues are timed appropriately.  The instruction is so complete that one doesn't constantly have to look up at the screen to see what the very achieved yoga teachers are doing...but I highly recommend VIEWING this DVD on occasion to gain increased perspective of HOW some of the poses are properly accomplished.  The instructors move at a CONTINUAL PACE...not too fast....so that the viewer can reap the benefit of seeing how positioning is accomplished.  The changing camera angle adds increased awareness of body positioning, which is extremely helpful.  The FOUR SEASONS  are a good practice in themselves, with SPRING being the warm up. Proceeding through SUMMER, FALL and WINTER, the body, mind and spirit will be invigorated.  When time is limited one can do the SPRING warm up with another season or just do the added special restorative Lunar flow alone....but when time allows, I prefer doing all four seasons plus the lunar flow.  IT GIVES A COMPLETE, BALANCED YOGA SESSION for the intermediate level practitioner. The complete practice takes about an hour and ten minutes, which for me is perfect!  THIS IS NOT A BEGINNER DVD!  ...and there are no alternative poses for the positions, therefore this DVD is for those who have experience in knowing how to modify positions for their own bodies.  The background music is absolutely beautiful...and peaceful.  There is nothing special about the yoga studio...but it's fine and is not distracting by any means.  It is NOT like the fabulous coastal backgrounds of SHIVA REA'S DVDs, but Shiva Rea is in a category all by herself...THE BEST!  So, if you are an intermediate level yoga practitioner and want some variety in your practice... (The same ol', same ol' gets a bit boring from time to time!!!)...I highly recommend YOGA RADIANCE be added to your collection.",1153267200,41,2065,5.0146627565982405
2552650,5,B000F5FMHG,"This DVD, which is subtitled ""Four Seasons of Renewal,"" lead you through four segments of intermediate vinyasa flow yoga--Spring (10.5 minutes), Summer (16 minutes), Autumn (6.5 minutes), and Winter (15 minutes)--plus includes Lunar (25 minutes), a restorative flow.  Each segment features one of three different instructors (Genevieve Fischer, Ester Hillebrand, and Carolina Vivas) alone in a softly lit room with beautiful soothing music playing in the background; a single instructor (I'm not sure which one) provides voiceover cueing throughout the practice.  The DVD includes a chapter menu which allows you to play the entire practice (all four seasons plus Lunar) or to select any of the five segments individually.  Spring and Lunar in particular work well as stand-alone practices; the other three simply require the addition of your own warm-up/savasana.

The Spring segment begins with some simple seated stretches and then moves into a series of the traditional ""B"" sun salutation.  This section moved a bit fast for my liking; I think a slightly gentler opening would have be more appropriate.  Summer and Autumn, both of which focus on standing postures, were my favorite segments.  These segments move at a slower, more measured pace, but be prepared to do many chatturanga-updog-down dog vinyasas in-between the standing poses.  Summer includes basic standing postures such as warrior 1, warrior 2, right angle, and triangle plus twisting postures like revolved triangle and revolved half-moon.  It ends with some more advanced postures, including tripod headstand, side crane (crow), and bird of paradise.  The short Autumn sequence consists of challenging standing balances such as standing hand-to-foot, warrior 3, standing splits, and dancer's pose; it ends with variations on standing forward bend.  Winter is the backbending/inversions segment, with camel, bridge, a long hold of wheel (upward bow--5 breaths!), shoulderstand, plow, and fish pose.  It finishes with happy baby pose, reclined twists, and a short savasana, so you can either end your practice here (approximately 50 minutes) or go on to the Lunar segment for a longer practice (75 minutes).  This final segment is very relaxing series of gentle, flowing stretches to prepare you body for a more lengthy (5 minutes) savasana; postures here include cat, down dog, a lunge series, pigeon, double pigeon, seated forward bends, reclined leg stretch, modified shoulder stand, and reclined twist.  During the savasana, images of the three instructors performing asanas from the video flash on screen; there is no further instruction at this point, but the music changes once the credits begin.

As an intermediate yogi, I consider this practice to be prefect for my level.  There were some postures that I couldn't do--tripod headstand is an impossibility for me, I can do crow but not side crow, and my version of bird of paradise is quite stooped and crooked--but I enjoyed attempting the more challenging postures and feel that I can grow with this practice.  I especially liked the season breakdowns, as I know I will utilize these for shorter yoga practices when I have less time (Lunar in particular is an excellent stand-alone practice, especially as a cool-down after a more traditional workout).  Finally, the inspiring asana displays of the three instructors combined with the beautiful music serves to make this DVD totally captivating.  However, it should be noted that the sequences on this DVD form a continuous flow, with little time for detailed instruction.  Therefore, although I definitely recommended this DVD, I would limit my recommendation to yogis at an intermediate level and beyond.",1152662400,85,3688,5.369791666666667
2552651,5,B000F5FMHG,"This is a DVD that simplicity makes it beautiful!  The instructions are very clear through out the entire practice yet it does not give much of alternative moves for beginners.  If you are in intermediate/Advanced level and just need a good session of flowing yoga practice, this is the one for you, but if you just started practicing yoga, and still have trouble to balance in tree pose, please think over one more time before you decide to buy this DVD.  I particularly like to do the lunar session before I go bed, it really helps me to let go my body and mind...",1150675200,17,566,4.423076923076923
2552652,5,B000F5FMHG,"For me YOGA RADIANCE taught the concepts of flow in an easy to comprehend manner.

The poses were easy to understand and remember. I liked the ideas of renewing energy over four seasons. It was actually fun to follow the clear instructions.

And the pace of the movements made for a good workout. Yoga Radiance is

as beautiful as it is effective. The Lunar chapter alone is worth the price of the DVD.",1146182400,12,402,4.47945205479452
2552653,5,B000F5FMHG,"I got this disc when I was a real beginner, and I found it fascinating and challenging. Now, a few years later, I see it as an intermediate level, classic yoga disc for when I have only 1 hour our less. If you skip the lunar sequence, you can get a decent work out in only 49 minutes!

You hit all the major poses (warrior 1 and 2, standing splits, half moon, back bends, head stands, triangle, etc.) plus a couple others like bird of paradise. There is no real core sequence though. However, the work out is quick and even good enough to make you sweat a bit.

The commentary is pretty straight-forward: no interesting metaphors or comments about life. While I usually find this annoying, I don't on this disc. The commentator's voice is nice and soothing. Music is gentle and interesting too. Filmed in the Yoga Loft in NYC, there is not a whole lot going on with the scenery, but it is clean and straight forward. If you are an advanced beginner this is a fantastic disc. After years of growing with this disc in my practice, I find that I still reach for it once or twice a month when I am short on time or sick of everything else.",1264464000,,1135,4.274418604651163
2552654,4,B000F5FMHG,"This is a good workout, but it does expect you to know the basics going in. They do not give you the names of the poses most of the time and they don't spell out how to do them, though there is a basic talk-through. I like this, since it gets the narrator out of the way for all but the most necessary cues, but if you need things spelled out, it will be frustrating.

Also, it is important toknow your limits,some of the asinas are tricky and they don't give modifications, so give yourself time and don't be a hero,just do what you can and work your way up. Also, for the love of your back and everything breakable in your living room, if you can't already do a headstand practice up against a wall at the beginning! And just go straight up if you need to, don't worry about doing a straddle split right away. If you keep these things in mind, this is a great DVD that will give an intermediate beginner lots of room to grow and improve, which I love since there's nothing more annoying to me than buying a disk and being bored three months later because it's all too easy now.

The only thing that kind of bugged me was the fact that the instructors are very scantily dressed and there is something about some of the camera shots that felt distinctly, well, porn-ish. It wasn't bad enough to be overly distracting, it was mostly just moments of, ""Really? That's a bit... unnecessary."" It almost feels like the goal was to entertain the husbands while the wives do their workout or something. Like I said, though, it isn't too bad and once I started focusing on doing the movements I didn't really notice anymore.",1254096000,,1615,4.362126245847176
2552655,5,B000F5FMHG,"One of the few yoga videos I have found that makes me sweat while maintaining its integrity as a -yoga- video, versus a ""yoga"" video that is more like a fitness tape that uses some yoga poses.

I do wish they would hold some of the poses for longer though and I don't like how it is broken up into five segments because I usually stop before I get to the fourth one since I am tired and I know it is quite difficult. I think it should be 1 segment and then the last segment (the lunar flow) should be its own segment.",1250553600,,517,3.9711538461538463
2552656,5,B000F5FMHG,"This dvd is pleasant to practice with.  The music doesn't get in the way, the instructors are beautiful, and the voice-over is zen.  I enjoyed the vigerous vinyasa sequences and the fact that there wasn't a lot of repetition.  Poses like headstand, shoulderstand, and lotus may be too challenging for a less experienced yogi.

The dvd is divided into four seasons as well as a very short lunar flow.  I like to do all four together for a longer practice, nearly an hour, or use the gentle lunar flow for days when I'm not feeling up to the intensity of a full practice.  Yoga Radiance incorporates many poses into a concise practice.  I reccommend this dvd to confident intermediate and advanced practitioners.",1241913600,,710,4.770491803278689
2552657,5,B000F5FMHG,"This is a must try for anyone wanting to take their practice deeper! I also recommend<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TAMARA-S-YOGA-FUSION/dp/B001DDY6RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION</a>",1220832000,,241,10.523809523809524
2552658,3,B000F5FMHG,"Everyone loves this DVD because of the production values, but I found the set and sweaty women a little intimidating. The yoga teachers had wonderful form, but it felt as if they were saying look what we can do and look what you cannot do.  I have other yoga DVDs with wonderful instructors dressed similarly, but for some reason I felt like I was watching soft porn during this DVD.  Maybe these teachers and Bryan Kest can get together and do a soft porn yoga DVD.  The class itself moves too fast and the cueing is awful.  It also has a weird sequencing to the poses.  If you are looking for a more advanced DVD, you probably will like this one because there are many difficult poses, and if you are a guy who wants to see beautiful, hot, sweaty women bending over backwards, you should also give this DVD a try.",1213401600,5,815,4.3355263157894735
2552659,3,B000F5FMHG,"This DVD does yoga poses at an aerobics pace.  If you can't keep up you will miss a pose or two, or three.  Part of the flow-pace issue is with the instruction.  For instance, the instructor will tell you a sequence of two or three moves and then the girl in the video will do them, so it takes some time to get your own flow-pace set so that you are neither too far ahead or behind.  Also, the amount of instruction is lacking.  For example, you will get a set of instructions for one side and then ""repeat on second side"" is all you get on the second.  Also, if you don't already have a good foundation of yoga poses and what they are called you will not be able to follow this DVD as there is not enough time to watch the video and then do it yourself before they have moved into a new pose.

The Spring and summer sections are as I have described above, very fast.  The Autumn focuses on balance so it is slowed down a bit.  Winter also is a bit slower, but this is usually where I start getting interrupted by my five year old, so if you don't have a five year old this may not apply.  The Lunar sequence, as it is intended to be done before bed, is very slow, so slow in fact I got bored and stopped.

With all of that said, this DVD is challenging and that makes it fun.  Its biggest downfall is the lack of verbal instruction which makes it difficult to follow even after doing it several times.",1211414400,5,1403,4.0618181818181816
2552660,3,B000F5FMHG,"Lovely cinematography, I enjoy the practice itself and feel fantastic at the end and I also appreciate some of the more challenging moves introduced here.

However the cueing is out of time and poses are somewhat rushed in places.  I also find that some of the stretching in the lunar sequence is not held long enough to give you any real benefit.

I reccommend this dvd for someone who would like some fresh ideas for their practice and a bit of a challenge but be prepared to be dissatisfied with the cueing and find the need to rewind or pause the dvd.",1207180800,2,555,4.421568627450981
2552661,5,B000F5FMHG,"This DVD has helped me take it to the next level.  I really enjoy this workout and it helps me feel challenged. I also like that there are still moves to strive for on this workout!

My only small complaint is that there are a couple of moves I'd start from a different position, they seem a little awarkward the way they were ""choreographed"". The main ones are Bird of Paradise and the first time we come into Cresent Moon. I just come into it the way I'm used to doing it in my class at the gym.  It's nothing major, I just make my little adjustment and the workout continues to be fabulous.

The 4 seasons are a nice touch and you can easily break up the workout if you are short on time. Spring is the warmup and gets you flowing, Summer is the strengthening/power yoga part, Autumn has nice balancing poses and wraps up with Winter and shoulder stands, plow and backbends and shavasana. It is almost 50 mins, total.

I always finish the workout feeling amazing! I recommend this if you are an intermediate level practioner.  Other good workouts are Yogatopia, Shiva Rea's workouts, Rainbeau Mars Pure Power and Rodney Yee's Intermediate Yoga.",1199664000,,1147,4.516908212560386
2552662,5,B000F5FMHG,"There are five shorter practices that, together, add up to about seventy minutes of yoga. Put the five segments together for an outstanding and inspiring, deeply physically and mentally stimulating session.  It's wonderfully challenging, flows beautifully and leaves you invigorated and yet deeply relaxed and satisfied.  It includes an unusually wide range of asanas including a few that are not often found together on one DVD lesson (some examples are Dancer, Bird of Paradise, Wheel, Pigeon, Double Pigeon, Side Crow and Tripod Headstand).

You could, of course, pick and choose segments to suit the length and content you want for the day.  However, although the full seventy minute practice is almost perfect, individually each segment feels incomplete and unbalanced - without the usual beginning (warm up), middle (strength, stretch, balance, twisting and inversions) and end (cool down, Shavasana) that a full yoga practice should contain.  It's each individual's choice of course.

Be aware that the asanas are not held for long and the transitions from one to another are smooth but fast.  If you prefer to hold your pose, using your strength to get deeper and deeper into each move, this is not the DVD for you.  However if you enjoy incorporating dance-like lessons into your yoga schedule you'll love it.

The instruction is minimalist.  It's clear and precise, and the instructor has an extraordinarily silky voice, but it's there purely to let you know where you will be moving to next. There's no direction regarding the technicalities of a pose, correct placement, proper breathing, the bhandas or alignment.  Also, there's no spiritualism or inspirational `chat'.  I think this is so that you can concentrate and focus internally without analyzing.

For the reasons mentioned though, this is not a DVD that will `teach' you yoga.  This is a DVD that an experienced Yogi, who is practiced in the asanas and needs little or no explanation, will use as an uninterrupted and profound home yoga session.

Even if someone is fit and strong with fairly good stamina I would not recommend this DVD for complete beginners.  Not because they couldn't do it, anyone who has a basically good level of fitness can `get through it', but because just going through the motions, with no knowledge of the technicalities mentioned previously is not as beneficial as using correct technique, and it could even be harmful.

Beautifully shot, with a rich yet simple and very warm feel to it.  Subtle music that is calming without intruding.  The instructors are beautiful and inspirational, perfectly demonstrating complete concentration.  Two tiny, tiny criticisms: firstly, personally I would have enjoyed a two minute (or so) seated meditation at the beginning.  Not for spiritual reasons, but to give myself a moment to establish Ujaii with focus, and to centre myself (I overcome this by giving myself a moment before running the DVD).  Secondly, there is one small period, one move on one side, where the instruction is incorrect and the right and left are mixed up.  No biggie though.",1199145600,,3089,5.121756487025948
2552663,4,B000F5FMHG,"Beginners (0 to 3 months of practice at home or in a studio):  You can clearly see the appropriate form for the movements, so I do recommend viewing this.  However, you need at least a few months of practice before even bothering to try this dvd.

Intermediates:  You will love this dvd.  If you practice in a studio, it doesn't really offer any moves you haven't seen.  If you only practice at home, you will be impressed with the choice and sequence of postures.  The dvd is put together nicely and offers a complete practice when you perform the entire 45 minutes.  No section on its own is really enough to feel balanced.

Advanced:  this is good for you too but it's not too vigorous.

For me (the Advanced Beginner): I only had trouble with one posture, (straightening my leg while binding underneath it). The first time I put this dvd on I just watched it.  It's really a nice practice, although plain and simple in background and narration.  The instructors look like they're performing a beautiful dance.  You won't be disappointed!",1196899200,2,1041,4.648351648351649
2552664,4,B000F5FMHG,This is my favorite Yoga DVD. The only reason it did not get a 5 was because they do not hold the poses as long as I would like. I own several Rodney Yee DVD's and this one rates right up there. I like the fact that it has a nice variety of poses that vary in difficulty.,1188000000,2,271,3.689655172413793
2552665,5,B000F5FMHG,"As soon as i got this DVD i popped it in and began following it. I must say it is not for beginners, but if you have been doing yoga for about a year and want a bit of a challenge this DVD is for you, and that is why i chose this dvd. I didn't have any difficulties keeping up with the vinyasa flow, i found the poses flowed well one into the other. I was flexible enough to do most poses (ex.the wheel) and having had a dance history i was able to do most balance poses aswell(ex. Standing splits, bird of paradise)I broke out into a sweat feeling great!! At first...i paid mostly attention to the dvd to observe the poses and become familiar with them, after that, now i just listen to the soothing voice instructions and i'm able to focus better on holding my poses and concentrate on breathing. The setting is not distracting at all. I liked that it is broken down into four seasons, each lasting about 12-15 minutes, and therefor i am able to choose which ones i want to do. some days i do more some days less. And the last sequence is truely calming, i light candles and burn incense to wrap up this wonderful workout.

2552666,5,B000F5FMHG,"I didn't love this DVD at first, but after a few attempts, I have fallen in love with it!  I love its smooth flowing transitions as it tones, strengthens, encourages flexibility and keeps my heart rate up.  I appreciate that it breaks the DVD down into segments for those of us that only have a short time to work out, yet it allows you to play through it all continuously.  On my scale, I would place this DVD right next to, or just below Brian Kest and Mark Blanchard; all very similar vinyasa flow but Brian and Mark seem to push me a little bit more. I would consider my expertise level intermed-I have been ballet dancing for 22 years, and have been an avid exerciser all my life beyond dancing. I would recommend adding this to your collection;I love my collection, but I am always looking for something to freshen the monotony of my collection. This deserves two thumbs up!!!!",1184457600,,883,4.472049689440993
2552667,3,B000F5FMHG,"This disc presents an excellent sequence of poses which are fun and energizing to perform.  The disc's major drawback is in its poor cuing and inadequate verbal teaching.  There is too little in the way of verbal teaching on detailed pose adjustments or internal locks and lifts.  This kind of adjustment is a crucial ""value added"" element of a good teaching session, and it helps you refine the poses for maximum benefit.

Verbal instruction on this disc is done in a sort of odd shorthand (""cross leg over ankle"", ""move legs to 90 degrees"") which is probably intended to be minimalist and non-distracting but conveys too little information when you can't see the screen and ends up being merely confusing.  One gets the impression that the viewer is supposed to memorize the sequences before doing the program.

Cuing for changing poses is also out of synch with the physical movements shown on the screen.  If you look at the screen in an effort to decipher the cryptic instructions, the transition has probably already taken place.  Sometimes cues for changing sides are left out altogether, even when the pose being performed makes it impossible to see the TV screen.

I am seldom confused by video yoga programs, but this disc did a good job of confusing me.

This disc might be good for more experienced practitioners who don't want or need much instruction during their practice.  Once you memorize the sequence, it makes for a good yoga session.  But why buy an instructional  disc if you don't want instruction?  This disc is the informational equivalent of a series of photos with minimal commentary.",1183852800,9,1611,4.875
2552668,5,B000F5FMHG,"This workout is divided into ""seasons"" so that you can chose short segments (about 12 minutes each) instead of doing the whole workout.  This is good for me because I cannot do more than 2 seasons at once!  I work up a good sweat, and I was happy to see that the instructor was too.  My goal is to get into good enough shape that I can do the whole DVD all at once.

Music is gentle; direction is pleasant and direct.

I was originally bothered by the lack of modesty in the instructors' appearance, but I just get so busing trying to follow the intense workout that I don't have much time to look at them, other than to glance up to make sure I am doing the pose correctly.

Definitely not for beginners or people who have a problem getting into all the stretches and bends.  There are still a few poses that I still can't get, but I see that the more I do the DVD the better I get at it.",1180915200,,889,4.045714285714285
2552669,5,B000F5FMHG,"Beth Cholette & Rebecca Johnson wrote great reviews as always. The only thing I can add is that it's in 2.0 stereo & widescreen format. The camera work is beautifully done. The music is very light & low in volume but sweet. The narration was spoken in an unrushed speed, very brief to keep as much silence as possible, as such, there are no modifications, very little reminders of proper posture & she will even tell you the next 2 poses long before the woman demonstrating is going to get out of the present pose if that sequence has been done 1x already. The end 3 minute meditation after the Lunar segment shows beautiful photographs of the women doing beginner to advanced yoga poses with grace.
The video is all one loop & you can choose the chapter/season. The way it's laid out it's obvious all the seasons are meant to go together & the Lunar is for for relaxed night time since the poses are held a long time, not as difficult & the time allowed to get in/out of them is very slow.
The woman demonstrating make all these positions look easy as they even get in/out of them with slow grace.
I couldn't do several of them (anything demanding arm strength) but even so, I still loved seeing poses I normally don't see in many other yoga dvds such as fish, crow, wheel, pigeon, happy baby, dancer's pose, revolved triangle & moon.. even moon I normally never see which is unfortunate.
The only unusual thing I saw was camel, it was a very modified version where you stay sitting on your heels, & just bend the back/head back. I was very surprised with that severe modification.
All in all, with the beautiful production mood set, the inspiring grace, the limited speaking to reflect, I will use this again & again.

2552670,4,B000F5FMHG,"I feel most of the poses are rushed.

I've been practicing for about 8 years and have a pretty decent Yoga DVD library.  Without question, ""Yoga Radiance"" is one of the most artistic, aesthetically pleasing yoga videos out there.  The practice is solid, the teachers are inspiring, and the soundtrack is wonderful!

If the poses weren't so hurried, this DVD would have easily received 5 stars from me.  Perhaps it's me and the classes/DVDs I'm used to, but I enjoy hanging out in a pose like Pigeon for 5 full breaths...and I'm talking 5 long, relaxing breaths.  ""Yoga Radiance"" has you in and out of poses very quickly.  While I enjoy this practice, I resent having to either modify the sequence or hit the pause button in order to really sink into some asanas.

For those of you who love the more challenging, intermediate poses, try ""Power Yoga For Happiness"" with Eoin Finn.  His practice is tough but fun, cool poses like Galavasana, Tittibhasana and Astavakrasana are offered, and his timing is perfect.",1177286400,8,1009,4.786127167630058
2552671,1,B000F5FMHG,"This DVD moves through the poses at such speed that I cannot keep up or get fully into the poses.  Also, the instruction is so minimal that at times she doesn't even state what pose is next.  The names of the poses are not the traditional names that I am used to.  The girls are doing yoga indoors, however they must have the furnace cranked because they are wearing extremely small clothes and sweating profusely.  It is kind of uncomfortable.  I agree with another reviewer that it felt kind of like it had a ""soft porn"" feel to it.  I can deal with that, but not with the speed.

Last night I tried to give it one more try and just did the lunar section -- seems hard to get that wrong.  Again, they moved through the poses way too fast.  I liked the sequence and choice of asanas, however I will just have to do them on my own at my own pace so I can get the benefits of the pose.",1176422400,2,884,4.063583815028902
2552672,5,B000F5FMHG,"I am really glad I ""listened"" to the reviews and bought this DVD myself. A wonderful sequence, very professionally executed, a MUST for intermediate yogis.",1175904000,,155,5.24
2552673,5,B000F5FMHG,"I really can't gush enough about this lovely practice.  I feel so great just doing one small part or the whole thing. Graceful, strong instrution and execution make for a ""must have"" for intermediate to advanced yogis. WONDERFUL!!!",1173657600,,231,5.078947368421052
2552674,4,B000F5FMHG,"More advanced video than advertised.  Wonderful strength and balance poses, but DO NOT try them unless you are well conditioned.  Spring, fall and winter are warm up, strength and cool down seasons.  Summer is particularly difficult and includes some of the most advanced yoga poses I've seen in my 10 years practicing.  Wonderful to aspire to do, but you will hurt yourself if you go in without warning.",1173571200,4,404,4.897058823529412
2552675,5,B000F5FMHG,"Yoga Radiance is a collection of invigorating vinyasas for intermediate to advanced practitioners who enjoy the beauty of yoga as much as the energizing and healing benefits. The delicate lighting slipping through the sheer vanilla curtains and shades, shimmering wood floors, black sheets up against the wall and artist studio type settings give the workouts a classic stylized mood. An empty apartment and women who look like models exercise with precise movements.

This invigorating challenge with narration makes you feel like a dancer and the balance challenges are advanced. Cat, Downward Facing Dog, Cobra, Warrior 1 and Chair are included, but this goes much further. Crane/Crow posture tests your arm strength and the ""Trivikramasana/Three-stride-posture"" and ""Half Moon/Ardha-Candrasana"" provides incredible balance and flexibility challenges.

Each section focuses on a seasonal theme and there is also a beautiful Lunar segment with candles surrounding a mat with a bamboo plant. Cat, low lunge, pigeon provide a slower pace and yet I still found this segment to be warming.

During the Autumn section, it is helpful to know that you should first spread the toes before attempting to stand on one leg in Warrior III. The dancer's pose is also easier if you have learned this technique. In the section on Winter, the tortoise stretch and backbends provide a space in which to develop patience.

As an intermediate who enjoys trying out advanced exercises, I found this to be invigorating and exciting. If you are looking for a new challenge and enjoy ""Vinyasa"" or flowing yoga style workouts, I think you will love this series of workouts. Due to the inclusion of a few more complex exercises, this workout will be giving me challenges for the next few years!

2552676,4,B000F5FMHG,"I love this Yoga Video.  All of the routines are great and are easily broken down into chapters, which make it easy to create a short, medium or long practice.  This is not your basic yoga video, considering some of the advanced asanas like bird of paradise, tripod headstand and side crow.  But for someone like me, who gets frustrated with easy yoga and fitness DVDs, this challenging video is exactly what I have been looking for!",1170115200,4,433,4.597402597402597
2552677,4,B000F5FMHG,"I got this workout recently because I was intrigued by the idea of yoga practice for each season.  I enjoyed it, but think that it is really important for the user to not go beyond their current level of flexibility.  There are no modifications given, so one has to do their own.  The music & photography are lovely.",1169683200,,316,4.413793103448276
2552678,4,B000F5FMHG,"I just got this DVD a few weeks ago and did it for the first time the other night.  The pace is much faster than I am used to and to be honest I have never done some of the poses that they were doing.

This is defintely NOT for the beginner.  I will definitely try it again and possible watch it once before practicing.",1168992000,2,319,3.876923076923077
2552679,4,B000F5FMHG,"Very difficult. Not for the beginner. I have been practicing Bikram Yoga for over 7 years, and decided to try a different yoga.  This was very fast paced and the poses were much different than Bikram Yoga.  If  you are looking for a change, start out with a beginner yoga video and then work your way up to this video.",1168992000,4,318,4.266666666666667
2552680,5,B000F5FMHG,"I've been doing yoga for about two years and wanted a challenge beyond beginner poses.  This DVD is definitely a great bridge into intermediate yoga.  It includes a tripod headstand, bird of paradise, side crow balance, a challenging side plank, shoulder stand, and backbends with one leg lifted.

The flow moves quickly, without much explanation, so you have to be familiar with the standard poses.  It also helps to have knowledge of modifications, since there are not any offered.  For some of the poses I use a block, and I practice the headstand against a wall.

This would be a great DVD for anyone who has had a few years' experience with power yoga DVDs and classes.  Since there is not much explanation on the DVD it helps to have a yoga teacher who can adjust your poses.  I love this DVD; when I began it seemed daunting but it's becoming less challenging.  Not for beginners.",1168387200,6,887,4.634615384615385
2552681,5,B000F5FMHG,"I recently purchased a new hi definition widescreen television and was

looking for a yoga dvd that would be compatible with this technology. I

was delighted to discover that Yoga Radiance was featured in this new

format. The visual impact is no less than stunning.

It really feels like a personal yoga instruction.

I have been doing yoga through dvd instruction for about three years

and am somewhat of a beginner. I found that while some of the poses

were quite challenging I was able to do most of it and look forward to

working my way up to the more complex ones. I also enjoyed the use of

the seasons as a way to practice the vinyasa flows. Each season created

a workout that was at first easy and became more demanding. Yoga

Radiance presently tops my list of yoga DVD's to keep up my daily

practice.  As others have mentioned, Lunar is a beautiful soothing

piece to do before bedtime. It puts you in a blissful relaxed state.",1165881600,4,944,4.476470588235294
2552682,5,B000F5FMHG,"Contains yoga sequences of poses (vinyasa) drawn from Series I and II of Ashtanga yoga that are divided into 'seasons' with a narrator and three yoga instructors presenting the material.  Previous exposure to this material or concurrent instruction would be helpful to understand the biomechanics of the individual poses and the details of their use.  The format is not uniform throughout:  in different parts of the video, both Sanscrit and informal English names of the poses are used, which would make it difficult to access additional material, such as the Yoga Journal website.

Ably presented and useful for supplementary practice for all levels of practitioners.",1162425600,5,669,5.3428571428571425
8117690,4,B000F5FMHG,"If you can get around the poor videography, this is actually a great yoga video. It has a nice flow and a good number of vinyasas. There are also some nice twisting and balancing poses, as well as inversions. I like the segments, though I wish each segment transitioned a little faster. I like to keep the flow going. You need to have a pretty good background in yoga poses and alignment, as the poses move quickly, so this is not ideal for a beginner. I feel really great after this practice",1459814400,,492,4.358695652173913
8117691,5,B000F5FMHG,The video has 4 session and varieties of positions which is great for advanced yoga person.  It's great for short exercise like 20-25 minutes it seem.  I would have liked for it to be done all in one session for longer exercise so I don't feel like I have to repeat some of the same steps.,1399420800,,289,4.142857142857143
8117692,5,B000F5FMHG,I have been preforming yoga for the past twenty years.  I also regularly hit the gym for weights and I occasionally do marathons.

8117693,2,B000F5FMHG,"I should have read the reviews!  I enjoy yoga for the deep breathing.  There is no time for a normal in and out sequence, much less an opportunity for deep breathing.

This is an intermediate to advanced yoga practice, which I am at intermediate level; however, the poses are not held very long and they move through them too quickly. The quality of the video is not that great for a large screen TV (rented instant streaming). The music is relaxing, but you hardly notice because there is barely any breathing techniques between poses. I would not do this video by itself. I think incorporating one of the segments after your regular exercise or other yoga video would work better after a person is already warmed up. The warm up segment is very short or almost non-existent at the beginning of the video.",1346803200,,762,4.651851851851852

I personally didn't love it. The music and setting is very beautiful though.

This is what I would look for in an actual class. Something intense but graceful, with some balancing but also sequences that will get you breathing. I love the way it is shot, the non-distracting scenery, and the overall feel of the yoga practice. Please help if you know of any others in the same realm as this.

It's the one I reach for when I'm a bit wired and want a bit of tranquility but also not a complete beginners practice. I think the producers of the dvd were aiming to produce a trance like state and they pretty much hit the mark. The narrator has a very soothing voice and the music is hypnotic. The practitioner pretty much just breathes and moves at a leisurely (not necessarily slow) pace. The dvd is definitely not in your face and it's not a pushover either. The hardest asanas are side crow, bird of paradise and double pigeon. If you are building a yoga dvd library there is a position for this production in it.",1287619200,,703,4.333333333333333
