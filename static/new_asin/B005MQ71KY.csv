8479551,1,B005MQ71KY,"Lacking substance, interest, entertainment, simply no value. As bad as buying a book with no type print.  This is a straight 10 of 10 on the Sleep-o-meter",1523145600,,154,4.703703703703703
8479552,3,B005MQ71KY,"If you are a fan of naturalistic, documentary style footage of poor folks, this has it.  If you demand plot and action, this doesn't have it.  Since the subject is the funeral of a young man who overdosed on drugs, much of it consists of people commenting on his life and the relatives in general.  There is even a strange post-wake party at a low budget karaoke bar and diner with a hired deejay.  I hesitate to call this ""poverty porn"" but the backstory is nowhere near as compelling as ""Winter's Bone"" which was a must see.  ""Putty Hill"" simply loses it's energy and focus halfway through.",1390176000,2,592,4.4953271028037385
8479553,5,B005MQ71KY,Good reality view of Baltimore life.  Matt is destined to be a big name someday based on these movies so early in his career.,1373328000,2,125,4.208333333333333
8479554,5,B005MQ71KY,"This is a 2-disc set of movies made by Matt Porterfield, a filmmaker living in Baltimore. He directed both films and either wrote or co-wrote both as well. His movies are artistic and are filmed in Baltimore. This collection also has some extras and commentaries by the director. These are well-made dramas, with strong visuals, about young people's lives in Baltimore. Highly recommended.",1360281600,2,389,5.190476190476191
