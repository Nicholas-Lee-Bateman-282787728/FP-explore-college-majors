2992533,5,B000WW1YME,"The whitest kids you know is a mash up of ""Kids in the Hall"" and ""Monty Python"".  Dress wearing (not many ladies in this show) and crude,  their sketches are sometimes brilliant and often offensive,  this is the only sketch comedy show on today worth watching.  I can NOT recommend this enough.",1199232000,11,294,4.596153846153846
2992534,1,B000WW1YME,"Usually when I watch sketch comedy, there is occasionally a funny line,
a cute look, or a pratfall that makes me laugh. Even if the sketch is
bad, there usually are a few seconds in it that are OK, even on the
horrific SNL.  Not here, though. I watched part of the marathon that IFC
had for this show, and I was genuinely shocked at how awful this stuff
is.  There are no laughs in it at all, not one.  From a comedy viewpoint, it might actually be the worst sketch show ever. The jokes are on the level of a 10 year old, and it seems that was the point. There was not even a slight chuckle, no smiles, nothing. Zero kelvin. 273 degrees below zero not funny.

Many will disagree on my review. Many will say ""go watch Friends or Two
and a Half Men"" (for the record, I dislike both shows). They will say
""go watch your reality TV in your mom's basement, loser"" (for the
record, I don't watch reality TV, my mom doesn't have a basement, and
I'm not a loser). Many will call it the greatest sketch show ever. Many
will call this brilliant, out there, edgy, pooperific (yes, Whitest
Kids U Know proudly carries on the tradition of coprophilia that is
very hip in comedy today, exemplified by the ""Timmy Poop His Pants"" sketch), genius, true art, colossal, stupendous, the greatest TV show ever made, and they are all absolutely 100 percent wrong and deranged. Just because something isn't mainstream or because it's ""out there"" doesn't make it great.  People really need to wake up and have some standards.  This stuff is scraping the bottom of the barrel.",1199145600,9,1551,4.424561403508772
2992535,5,B000WW1YME,"Just when I thought I was too jaded and desensitized to think anything amusing anymore I find 'Whitest Kids U'Know'. These young comedians seem to be tapping into the sort of comedic genius wherein excrement jokes become self-aware and willingly choose to revel and partake in their very nature. They manage to turn stupidity, into ridiculousness, on into true comedy.

Go watch some episodes on [...]. Hilarity will ensue.",1198886400,18,423,5.130434782608695
2992536,5,B000WW1YME,"I loved this show when it was on Fuse. It was very funny. I'm so glad to see that this wonderful comedic sketch series (Which reminds me of a raunchy SNL) is coming to DVD uncut and uncensored. Some of the greater sketches include:

iPod sketch: The one that started it all. Let's just say that something undesirable happens to a guy's iPod shuffle.

Hitler Rap: Funny rap. Not for the easily offended

Peeing: Simple and effective.

Abraham Lincoln: Seems like Honest Abe had a foul mouth on him!

There are many more. This show is not for the easily offended or for children! Not to be taken seriously! You can bet on me watching Season 2 when it premeres on IFC in February!",1196726400,9,677,4.42741935483871

2992538,5,B000WW1YME,"My favorite skits include the spacemen, obnoxious Abe Lincoln, the pimp, draw it or I'll fire you, Mom look what I bought, and the deer.

2992541,5,B000WW1YME,This show is hilarious.  I love it and highly recommend it!  Be warned you may be offended if you are easily offended by various things... The first season is one of the best ones though.,1359590400,,187,4.314285714285714

2992543,5,B000WW1YME,WKUK are a freaking hilarious comedy troupe. Buy all of their DVDs.  Season 1 is a great place to start. I watch these all the time and I show them to eveyondy I meet who hasn't seen them before. I love hese DVDs,1354492800,,212,3.9302325581395348
2992544,5,B000WW1YME,"Though I'll admit they're probably not for everyone, WKUK have to be the funniest guys around.

2992549,5,B000WW1YME,"I must say that in this age of sitcoms and safe writing, the only shows we have to push the limits is Family Guy and South Park. I must say that as good as both shows are I like it when comedy is pushed to the line of cringe inducing and then crosses it. Whitest Kids U Know is a visual adaptation for some of the stuff that I talk about with my friends. The ideas that are presented here in this show are things that friends would come up with to incite a laugh or make someone cringe. I love the Point/Counter sketch as well as Sexy Fawn. This is one series that I can honestly say has made me laugh to the point of tears in every episode. I have since watched some of my favorite sketches several more times and I still laugh just as hard. I often find myself quoting it in normal situations and seeing people react to the quotes. While I did not buy it on Amazon, I searched for months in local stores for a copy, and it so happens that I found it at a movie store. I do not regret spending the 30 dollars to purchase it then.",1264464000,3,1030,3.9806763285024154
2992550,5,B000WW1YME,"I just got into this show and I really enjoy it! Basically, for those of you who don't know anything about this show, it consists of multiple skits within each episode. Sadly you don't get many episodes, I think it's 10 in this complete season. However, if you like comedy, including adult humor(not for kids), and I believe it attracts mainly college student humor, you will enjoy this show as well.",1252022400,5,400,4.647887323943662
2992551,5,B000WW1YME,Best comedy troupe ever. Especially if you can take a joke. Bring on season 2!,1237507200,,78,4.266666666666667

2992554,5,B000WW1YME,"This purchase was for my daughter. While I do not like their humor at all (VERY LACKING IN PC), my daughter loves them.
My perchase went very smoothly, and for that, I am happy",1234137600,,176,4.205882352941177
2992555,5,B000WW1YME,"Yup, more of that cutting edge, vulgar humor. But wait, this is comedic genius. Not since the early seasons of Kids in the Hall (Who are not so far from WKUK) has something so unexpected and hilarious been consistently put into so many episodes.",1220918400,,245,4.590909090909091
2992556,1,B000WW1YME,The antithesis of clever. Like watching a bad high school drama club production. Dimwits offering their hacked-up American version of Monty Python. (My apologies to Monty Python for associating them with this retarded bunch.),1210982400,4,225,5.647058823529412

2992558,5,B000WW1YME,"If you're a fan of skit comedy such as SNL, Kids in the Hall, or even Mad TV, then you'll definitely love this.

You can check some of Whitest Kids U Know's more popular sketches on youtube by simply searching for ""Whitest Kids U Know"" to get a taste of what WKUK is all about, however if you want to get all the sketches from season 1, you pretty much have to buy the DVD (there's too many to watch them all on youtube!)

So I highly recommend buying this if you want to watch & laugh to sketch comedy that is clever, outrageous, and hysterically funny.",1208908800,3,554,4.168224299065421
2992559,1,B000WW1YME,"Good lord, is this show bad!  I only made it through a handful of episodes before turning it off in disgust.  And I thought ""The State"" was the worst sketch show I ever saw (I guess I can thank my lucky stars no one ever gave ""The Bert Fershners"" their own program).  Good sketch comedy:  ""Mr. Show,"" ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" ""French & Saunders,"" ""Kids In the Hall,"" ""SCTV Network.""  This stuff should never be put on the air.  But, they're young guys.  Maybe if someone puts them all back in the comedy school, they'll grow and become funny.  Maybe they should go on tour with Dane Cook.  I'm sure their audiences would get along famously.",1206835200,6,647,4.508620689655173
2992560,5,B000WW1YME,"Very much worth picking up.  The Whitest Kids have a very Kids in the Hall vibe, if you're in to that thing.  Lots of fun.  If you have never seen them in action before I would highly suggest taking a look at their channel on the Independent Film Channel website.",1203552000,7,263,4.22
2992561,5,B000WW1YME,"awesome, just awesome. thank god these guys got a second season. Make sure you check out the commentaries. They make fun of Sam pretty good! Just buy it.",1202947200,2,153,4.5
2992562,5,B000WW1YME,"I happened to watch this show with a recommendation from a friend of mine and from the very first second I watched it, I fell in love with it. It does what a lot of sketch comedies fail do to, which is go completely past the line of what is ethical or not, and make ordinary things funny. They make fun of stereotypes and different genres of television and don't prioritize on whether or not it will offend others, or if it's politically correct. It focuses on the humor which all shows should hope to do. I love this show and recommend it to anyone who really wants to laugh.",1202860800,3,576,4.245454545454545
2992563,5,B000WW1YME,"The WKUK are the most entertaining troupe I've seen. The season one dvds are obviously uncensored, which is nice. Some sketches on Fuse were full of bleeps, like ""What really happened to Abe Lincoln."" All of the sketches are amazing, but even if you've seen them all on tv, the commentary is a new reason to buy this dvd. It's not typical as far as commentaries go and I think it, alone, is reason enough to buy; it's so hilarious!",1202428800,5,431,4.4
2992564,4,B000WW1YME,"Originally aired on Fuse before finding a proper home on IFC, The Whitest Kids U' Know is the best sketch comedy show you've never seen.  Created by and starring Trevor Moore, Zach Cregger, Sam Brown, Darren Trumeter, and Timmy Williams; The Whitest Kids U' Know is often inspired sketch comedy with an edge, and is reminiscent of early MAD TV (minus the laugh track or audience) or more so Kids in the Hall.  All ten first season episodes are collected here, and feature hysterical moments such as Trevor Moore showing his musical side with ""Hitler Rap"", playing a guitar while telling kids how they can get a new daddy, and more besides.  Also in the mix are rampant conspiracy theories, a horny deer, different takes on Abraham Lincoln, a demon watching girls play with a Quija board, and a courtroom that falls victim to ""opposite day"".  While there are times when skits fall flat (the face off between the monster truck drivers comes to mind), The Whitest Kids U' Know is a hysterical blast that deserves to be checked out if you've been missing out on it so far.  The only disappointment about the DVD set is that more extras weren't included, but despite that, this is still definitely worth picking up for those who have enjoyed the show so far.",1202256000,16,1253,4.65158371040724
2992565,5,B000WW1YME,"I had never heard of the Whitest Kids U Know before the set came out. I just finished watching the last season of Kids in the Hall and wanted more so I bought it on a whim. Most skit comedy is somewhere in between stupid and watchable, but every so often there comes a group who take comedy to the next level and turn it into art.  TWKUK is up there with Kids in the Hall and Monty Python. On one level they preform silly absurdist sketches that any kid would be amused by. On another level, at least 75% of their sketches are beautifully crafted metaphors which say as much as any social commentary I have ever seen. It's one of the few shows that I have come across which can be watched and enjoyed by the intelligent and stupid alike. So, if you have a friend or family member who you can't watch anything with because your tastes are on opposite ends of the intellectual spectrum, buy this dvd set. One of you can watch it for the poop and boobs and the other for the social commentary. Both should find it enjoyable as long as you aren't easily offended. If they get offended you get the added entertainment of watching them turn red and freak out. Either way, buy it. I want more. The more of these they sell, the more seasons they will make.",1202256000,3,1248,4.243697478991597
2992566,4,B000WW1YME,"The WKUK are the greatest comedy troupe I have ever seen. Their sketches and songs are hilarious, but they offer more than that. They love what they do, and you can see the joy and enthuisiasm coming out of them as they perform. Its tangible, you can feel it. You can watch some of their stuff on YouTube to preview, and all of it is hilarious with sketches like ""Space Potatoes"", ""Motorcycle Mama"" and ""Supersize me, with whiskey!"" I know this DVD is a hit, and it will definetly teach you one thing... PIZZA BAGELS AREN""T FOR BREAKFAST!!!!",1202169600,7,541,4.530612244897959

3227050,5,B000WW1YME,"this is one of my favorite shows ever. the humor is off the wall and very random. if you like this sort of humor, you will love this show!",1234396800,,138,3.793103448275862
3227051,5,B000WW1YME,"This purchase was for my daughter. While I do not like their humor at all (VERY LACKING IN PC), my daughter loves them.
My perchase went very smoothly, and for that, I am happy",1234137600,,176,4.205882352941177
3227052,5,B000WW1YME,"Yup, more of that cutting edge, vulgar humor. But wait, this is comedic genius. Not since the early seasons of Kids in the Hall (Who are not so far from WKUK) has something so unexpected and hilarious been consistently put into so many episodes.",1220918400,,245,4.590909090909091
3227053,1,B000WW1YME,The antithesis of clever. Like watching a bad high school drama club production. Dimwits offering their hacked-up American version of Monty Python. (My apologies to Monty Python for associating them with this retarded bunch.),1210982400,4,225,5.647058823529412
3227054,5,B000WW1YME,"This is probably one of the funniest shows i've ever watched. It may not be for everybody because it can stupid and childish, but if you like that you'll love this.",1209686400,,164,4.32258064516129
3227055,5,B000WW1YME,"If you're a fan of skit comedy such as SNL, Kids in the Hall, or even Mad TV, then you'll definitely love this.

You can check some of Whitest Kids U Know's more popular sketches on youtube by simply searching for ""Whitest Kids U Know"" to get a taste of what WKUK is all about, however if you want to get all the sketches from season 1, you pretty much have to buy the DVD (there's too many to watch them all on youtube!)

So I highly recommend buying this if you want to watch & laugh to sketch comedy that is clever, outrageous, and hysterically funny.",1208908800,3,554,4.168224299065421
3227056,1,B000WW1YME,"Good lord, is this show bad!  I only made it through a handful of episodes before turning it off in disgust.  And I thought ""The State"" was the worst sketch show I ever saw (I guess I can thank my lucky stars no one ever gave ""The Bert Fershners"" their own program).  Good sketch comedy:  ""Mr. Show,"" ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" ""French & Saunders,"" ""Kids In the Hall,"" ""SCTV Network.""  This stuff should never be put on the air.  But, they're young guys.  Maybe if someone puts them all back in the comedy school, they'll grow and become funny.  Maybe they should go on tour with Dane Cook.  I'm sure their audiences would get along famously.",1206835200,6,647,4.508620689655173
3227057,5,B000WW1YME,"Very much worth picking up.  The Whitest Kids have a very Kids in the Hall vibe, if you're in to that thing.  Lots of fun.  If you have never seen them in action before I would highly suggest taking a look at their channel on the Independent Film Channel website.",1203552000,7,263,4.22
3227058,5,B000WW1YME,"awesome, just awesome. thank god these guys got a second season. Make sure you check out the commentaries. They make fun of Sam pretty good! Just buy it.",1202947200,2,153,4.5
3227059,5,B000WW1YME,"I happened to watch this show with a recommendation from a friend of mine and from the very first second I watched it, I fell in love with it. It does what a lot of sketch comedies fail do to, which is go completely past the line of what is ethical or not, and make ordinary things funny. They make fun of stereotypes and different genres of television and don't prioritize on whether or not it will offend others, or if it's politically correct. It focuses on the humor which all shows should hope to do. I love this show and recommend it to anyone who really wants to laugh.",1202860800,3,576,4.245454545454545
3227060,5,B000WW1YME,"The WKUK are the most entertaining troupe I've seen. The season one dvds are obviously uncensored, which is nice. Some sketches on Fuse were full of bleeps, like ""What really happened to Abe Lincoln."" All of the sketches are amazing, but even if you've seen them all on tv, the commentary is a new reason to buy this dvd. It's not typical as far as commentaries go and I think it, alone, is reason enough to buy; it's so hilarious!",1202428800,5,431,4.4
3227061,4,B000WW1YME,"Originally aired on Fuse before finding a proper home on IFC, The Whitest Kids U' Know is the best sketch comedy show you've never seen.  Created by and starring Trevor Moore, Zach Cregger, Sam Brown, Darren Trumeter, and Timmy Williams; The Whitest Kids U' Know is often inspired sketch comedy with an edge, and is reminiscent of early MAD TV (minus the laugh track or audience) or more so Kids in the Hall.  All ten first season episodes are collected here, and feature hysterical moments such as Trevor Moore showing his musical side with ""Hitler Rap"", playing a guitar while telling kids how they can get a new daddy, and more besides.  Also in the mix are rampant conspiracy theories, a horny deer, different takes on Abraham Lincoln, a demon watching girls play with a Quija board, and a courtroom that falls victim to ""opposite day"".  While there are times when skits fall flat (the face off between the monster truck drivers comes to mind), The Whitest Kids U' Know is a hysterical blast that deserves to be checked out if you've been missing out on it so far.  The only disappointment about the DVD set is that more extras weren't included, but despite that, this is still definitely worth picking up for those who have enjoyed the show so far.",1202256000,16,1253,4.65158371040724
3227062,5,B000WW1YME,"I had never heard of the Whitest Kids U Know before the set came out. I just finished watching the last season of Kids in the Hall and wanted more so I bought it on a whim. Most skit comedy is somewhere in between stupid and watchable, but every so often there comes a group who take comedy to the next level and turn it into art.  TWKUK is up there with Kids in the Hall and Monty Python. On one level they preform silly absurdist sketches that any kid would be amused by. On another level, at least 75% of their sketches are beautifully crafted metaphors which say as much as any social commentary I have ever seen. It's one of the few shows that I have come across which can be watched and enjoyed by the intelligent and stupid alike. So, if you have a friend or family member who you can't watch anything with because your tastes are on opposite ends of the intellectual spectrum, buy this dvd set. One of you can watch it for the poop and boobs and the other for the social commentary. Both should find it enjoyable as long as you aren't easily offended. If they get offended you get the added entertainment of watching them turn red and freak out. Either way, buy it. I want more. The more of these they sell, the more seasons they will make.",1202256000,3,1248,4.243697478991597
3227063,4,B000WW1YME,"The WKUK are the greatest comedy troupe I have ever seen. Their sketches and songs are hilarious, but they offer more than that. They love what they do, and you can see the joy and enthuisiasm coming out of them as they perform. Its tangible, you can feel it. You can watch some of their stuff on YouTube to preview, and all of it is hilarious with sketches like ""Space Potatoes"", ""Motorcycle Mama"" and ""Supersize me, with whiskey!"" I know this DVD is a hit, and it will definetly teach you one thing... PIZZA BAGELS AREN""T FOR BREAKFAST!!!!",1202169600,7,541,4.530612244897959
