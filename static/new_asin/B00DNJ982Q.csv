5835654,4,B00DNJ982Q,"Hello everyone. As soon as I saw that this Dvd was comimg out I ordered it. Its a pretty decent wrestling dvd if you like the old school stuff. One thing to watch out for is: There are a LOT of jobber matches, maybe 20 or so. One of the other great reviewers has a match listing. Read it for yourself. I just wanted to say, you get quantity not quality. There is no WWE footage at all. Really cheap price!",1383436800,7,405,4.012345679012346
5835655,5,B00DNJ982Q,"TALK ABOUT A WHO'S WHO'S, OVER 3 HOURS, THE DVD has 27 matches and you see some great stuff from 8 different promotions. ICW SOUTHWEST, IWA, TEXAS ALL-STAR, SOUTH ATLANTIC, TWF, HAWAII,  BIG TIME, MEMPHIS, there is also a Shiek vs Lewin match with Shieks manager Creechman as the referee. That is something i have never seen anywhere. They also have a lot of matches like that. Lars Anderson vs Badnews Allan, Eddie Gilber, Ivan Koloff, Brody, Andre, Ric Rude, the Sheepherders, and a lot more. The DVD has a steady flow and starts like a regular card with opening matches and builds up as it goes along. It is a neat way to show a lot of stars from different areas. If you like this era and i do, then its a no brainier for $8. It's a nice look at wrestling from the territory days. Back when wrestlers looked like normal men with rather then the chemical wrestlers that followed. .  Stretch",1382140800,4,892,4.432926829268292

8594923,2,B00DNJ982Q,"I have no problem with the content itself as I love to see the history of the business kept alive, regardless of what it is... but... those ""did you know"" pop ups are just completely annoying. It wouldn't be bad if it was a feature you could shut off, but you can't. It is also very random when it pops up, some have them right at the start, some in the middle of the match. So you're watching, then all of a sudden four of five ""did you know"" things pop up in the middle of the screen, blocking the footage you are trying to watch.

Nice to see some of the old Poffo ICW footage.",1394841600,2,580,4.0
8594924,4,B00DNJ982Q,"Overall an enjoyable DVD.  I wish they would stop the ""Did You Know"" graphics which take over the whole screen for several seconds and really takes you out of the action.

Otherwise fun DVD overall.  Memphis quality should be better as it is less than VHS in some cases.
