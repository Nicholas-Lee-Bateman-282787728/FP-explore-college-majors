8158249,1,B000KN9F7Q,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! This is the really bad dub of One Piece that was created by a company that openly believes kids are stupid and illiterate. If you truly are a fan of One Piece please buy the voyage sets that are done by FUNimation. I would only recommend this to you if you're either giving it to someone you hate and want them to know how much you hate them, or if your suicidal and need that one extra push that will make you do it after Dragonball Evolution wasn't able to. Seriously buy the FUNimation DVDs for a true One Piece experience.",1517875200,,556,4.254716981132075
8158250,5,B000KN9F7Q,"I know many will disagree because it's the 4Kids version of a great Anime.  However, I personally enjoy this for the sake of it being so bad, it's comedic.",1433721600,,155,4.344827586206897
8158251,3,B000KN9F7Q,"I was so wrong.

Upon a second look, the acting is terrible, stereotypical and annoying.
There are some voices(Zorro and Luffy) that are mildly acceptable. The others are just painful.

It seems that one piece only looked good in my memory. The Funimation dub is (though not perfect) several times better by comparison.

4kids really treated it like a child's cartoon (ages 4-7)",1357776000,,378,4.968253968253968
8158252,5,B000KN9F7Q,"I don't really read Manga or watch a lot of anime material, but I started watching One Piece on Saturday mornings when it was on in my area. What can I say?!?  I'm a 26-year-old guy who is always going to like cartoons. I only mention that to say that I'm not really a Manga/Anime expert, just a big fan of cartoons, books and good storylines.

Anyway, One piece, Vol. 7:

I was extra-excited about getting this one in the mail because this is where the show left off when it went off the air in my area. This is the volume in which Luffy finally lets Don Krieg have it (like Krieg ever had a chance). Luffy also finally manages to acquire Sanji as the head chef in his crew, and the rest of the guys start off after Nami, who stole their ship --surprise, surprise-- only to learn some of the unexpected aspects of her past. Watch out guys, the theme song just got a little longer, and more awesome!

It's another great handful of episodes. Whereas most of the sub-plotlines on the way to the Grand Line tend to be pretty similar (in form...not subject matter, of course), for some reason, I never seem to get tired of them. One Piece isn't everybody's cup of tea...it's got its own little niche, but for those of us who appreciate it, I'm sure we're all anxiously awaiting April 24 when ""The Belle of the Brawl"" becomes available for our viewing pleasure. I know I am. Anyway, enjoy these 5 episodes if you haven't already, and ""Set sail for One Piece.""",1175299200,3,1454,4.354243542435424
