7570416,5,B019D3J4V0,"This funny, actin packed, low budget cheese fest is clearly a homage and love letter to the spy shows and movies of the 1960's. The film is influenced and pays homage to such things as James Bond, Matt Helm, Flint, Eurospy movies, ""Get Smart"", ""The Avengers"", ""Man From UNCLE"", ""Mission: Impossible"", masked wrestling movies, the Kaiju genre and much more. A 60's spy-geek junkie's dream series. Stunts, fights, action, sexy women, gadgets and a hefty body count for a comedy! The entire cast is wonderful, especially Jerry Kokich as Superseven, Olivia Dunkley as Sandra West (Politically incorrect and doing all those things you wish Emma Peel would do, if she weren't so British and nice!) and Anne Leighton as the ditsy mechanical genius, Seriously, with soooo much garbage on TV, this really needs to be a TV series and soon!",1452902400,5,829,4.928571428571429

7570419,5,B019D3J4V0,"This film is awesome. There is action, comedy, adventure and  even sexy. It is so creative. I love that it has that old film and tv feel. Such a fun superhero - spy film to watch. You have got to watch it.",1482710400,,205,3.880952380952381

7570425,2,B019D3J4V0,"Amateurish. The male lead appears to be a solid actor, but almost nothing else--writing, editing, sound, sets, video quality, supporting performances--is strong. I'm surprised so many viewers gave it high marks.",1468195200,,211,5.838709677419355

7570427,5,B019D3J4V0,laffable but strangely compelling!! would love to see Superseven sequel!,1458000000,,72,6.3
7570428,4,B019D3J4V0,"Bold project by a truly independent mind, and a rare true independent filmmaker. Quality is better than most of this ilk, and the concept is
a unique twist on a theme borrowed from the 'b' movies of the '60s-early '70s. Dandy!!",1453852800,2,227,4.560975609756097
7570429,5,B019D3J4V0,Big bangs and large laughs against the forces of evil. Funny stuff and great performances from a talented cast.,1453766400,,111,4.894736842105263

7570431,5,B019D3J4V0,A well written and brilliantly acted tongue in cheek takeoff of a lot of your favorite spy shows.  Beautiful busty babes and a hero thats larger than life.  Love to see this as a weekly series on tv,1453420800,,198,4.184210526315789

7570434,5,B019D3J4V0,It's hilarious and well written. Cast is great and this film definitely doesn't take itself to seriously. If you like spoofs you'll love Superseven.,1453334400,,148,5.208333333333333
7570435,5,B019D3J4V0,"What a great show !  I'd love to see this as a continuing series for TV. I hope HBO ,Comedy Central , Showtime , etc.  see this . The world needs hero's ,laughs , hot babes ,action and whimsy.",1453161600,2,192,3.8974358974358974
8744808,5,B019D3J4V0,"...When Spy Films and TV Series from the 1960s ruled the airwaves! ""They Call Me Superseven"" captures the motif PERFECTLY with a healthy dose of Masked Mexican Wrestler and Superhero Cheesiness! It doesn't get any better than this!",1513555200,,231,5.105263157894737
8744809,1,B019D3J4V0,"OK.  I started watching this once before and quit.  Thinking I might just have been tired, I returned to it.  I've tried a second time now and...  no.  I can't even make it past the ""fencing"" scene at the start.  Acting is bad, costumes are (quite) substandard and if you're gonna write in a sword fight, use real damn swords, not get some tournamental epees and then whack at each other like they have edges.  It's odiously obvious.

You're gonna have to have a great like for cheese to like this one.",1513468800,,502,4.380434782608695

8744814,3,B019D3J4V0,"So  much bad acting cannot be unintentional.  Ed Wood would have been proud to direct this film. Olivia Dunkley's Sandra West steels the movie, although I never figured out if she was a villain or a hero.",1497744000,,204,4.486486486486487
