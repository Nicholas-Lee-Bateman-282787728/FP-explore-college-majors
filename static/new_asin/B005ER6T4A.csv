8468857,1,B005ER6T4A,"Nina (Gianna Pattison) is raped and he clothes are neatly put back on her. She is a martial arts student and goes ""spit on you grave"" against her attackers with some assistance and a need to gloat about her crimes to a priest. The film pretends to be a grindhouse, but lacks the characters, blood, violence, and sound track. Each of 6 different episodes is introduced by one of the ""Devil's commandments"", clearly made up for the script. There is a 1 year, 15 year, and 10 year flashback.

The film is that of assassins who kill people because ""God takes too long to make things right.""

Another tough one to sit through.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Off screen rape.",1416873600,2,672,4.491803278688525
