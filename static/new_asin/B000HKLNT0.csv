8140207,5,B000HKLNT0,"MY father was Rick Spake, one of the founders of the Hickory Nut Gorge EMS... he was one of the first responders who found ""Uncle Roy.""

""Uncle Roy"" Huskey was a beloved friend of our family, whose death caused my family much heartbeak and sadness.

Dad's Green Pick-up truck was a staple in Rutherford County... and if someone was in need, that green truck was usually the first on the scene. I want to get this movie for my mom. Because we lost our father in October 2010 and And when people came for his funeral, they spoke of how when in times of trouble and need... that green truck was the most wonderful sight to behold. They spoke of how on that day my father was there, how he had never lost his professionalism... until he arrived and saw Uncle Roy. And he lost it.

I will forever remember being in a school bus being escorted by a police car in the front and following behind while an officer with a shotgun stood beside the driver. None of us knew what was going on when they evacuated Green Hill Elementary School... nor understood why they wouldn't let us go into our homes unless our parents were there. That they kept us kids on the bus and on the move until each one of us was delivered safely to our parents. Until my mother told me that  Uncle Roy was dead, and that Dad was out trying to find the man who did it. Now everytime i see a police car with an officer inside it with their head down, I will stop and make sure they are okay. not matter what, not matter how late i am. i check on them. and i tell each one of them to never put their uniform on without their vests.

Heck, I wish they would remake this moive today... because it's a story that needs to be told today. To remind us all what duty and honor means. That when things are at their worse, doing the right thing is something you must do. Because it's the right thing. And it's how you truly show that you are indeed a human.",1355702400,2,1912,4.170731707317073
8140208,5,B000HKLNT0,"This is one of the finest movies/documenteries ive ever seen, Not comming from a hollywood studio, and must say that the Earl Owensby Studios in Shelby NC went to great lengths to make the 1988 movie, the Life and times of Sheriff Damen Husky ""played by Earl Owensby"" and the 1979 killing of 2 Rutherford County Sheriffs Deputies  Millard Messersmith and Roy Husky and North Carolina Highway Patrolman Robert L.(Pete) Peterson (G-235) as real and true to life as a movie studio can, no its not a perfect account, ""it is a movie"". Useing period official police cars, and actual sites as much as possible as well as actual NCHP recorded police radio traffic reporting Pete Peterson being shot down.and the search for him,as swarms of law enforcement officers poured into  Rutherford County, from surrounding citys and countys, Including SLED South Carolina Law Enforcement (Known for their highly trained Bloodhounds). The search for Killer James W Hutchins ( executed march 16 1984) Hutchins was appearently a really good shot,,he shot all 3 officers in the head from a distance. It is very compelling video of the incident, And the Sherriffs reaction to it esp considering that first officer killed Roy Husky was Sheriff Damen Husky's Brother and Millard and Pete were friends, But the movie starts as showing Damens demeaner and and stern lightheartedness, he was fearless at times,to only be scared of it later,Set In the very rural Community's of Forest city, Rutherfordton NC,in 1979,,how Damen handled some of the events that he encountered while Sheriff. ""shown in a lighthearted way"" He was Tough but a fair man, very polite and giving compliments of all that deserved it, a very good movie. we need more Damen Husky's nowdays.",1311465600,,1734,4.996539792387543
8140209,4,B000HKLNT0,"I live In Rutherford County and my husband worked for Damon Huskey on which the movie is based. Some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived.
The Part of the movie of the 3 officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening May 31st 1979.
My husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter.
So far this movie has only been available on VHS and would love to see it on DVD.
But it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some.
Kind of like Buford Pusser in ""Walking tall"" but he didn't carry a big stick just a big gun.",1243555200,,684,3.963768115942029
