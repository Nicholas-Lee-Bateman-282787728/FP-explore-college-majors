6230051,5,B00HW0OSPO,"As always these are tightly woven mysteries. The character interaction is well drawn, especially between Barnaby, his family and Troy. In fact, the TV series is so much better than the books, it was unbelievable. This is a case of a series making a better show than reading it!",1407024000,4,277,4.673469387755102
6230052,5,B00HW0OSPO,Keeps me guessing who done it without too much of the violent aspect.  The settings are quiet unique and I do like the little bit of humor put in the story line.,1403740800,,161,4.03125
6230053,5,B00HW0OSPO,"After much culinary experimentation, I have concluded the best cuisine to accompany these delightful episodes is a seafood salad. Mock crab reminds one how fishy life is in Midsomer! A dash of vinegar improves the taste as much as some of the ""salty"" characters add to the flavor of this delightful series. Lots of lettuce, some olives, a sprinkling of carrot slices provide bulk without adding calories, just as Midsomer episodes leave one feeling fulfilled without any nasty aftertaste. I also recommend including some pieces of cucumber and green peppers for something to chew on, for the daft clues in these charming tales keep one guessing almost to the last scene. For a feast of enjoyment, nothing beats Midsomer with seafood salad!",1402617600,,739,5.065573770491803

6230060,5,B00HW0OSPO,"Everyone seems to die in the various Midsomer villages.  But the stories are generally not visually gory and there is an appropriate dose of humor.  For those who may have difficulty becoming attuned to the British accents, subtitles are available.  But we get at least 80% of the dialogue without them.  I highly recommend this series.",1506384000,,336,4.946428571428571

now that I know AMAZON sells them I can't have enough. Somehow I relate to the BRITISH shows better than the AMERICAN shows.",1460073600,2,269,4.625
6230086,4,B00HW0OSPO,"Excellent now with that dumb Sgt. Troy off the series.  Beautifully done and reissued with subtitles & in the order that the series ran in the UK.  I will say I think they make their episodes too long, nearly 2 hours; could shorten them up a wee bit - gets a bit draggy.",1459468800,,270,4.0754716981132075
6230087,5,B00HW0OSPO,"Things that go Bump in the Night causes Barnaby and Sgt Scott to take a hard look at religion VS spiritualism as the body count mounts.
Dead in the Water focuses on the annual Midsomer Regatta and a ladies man whos all wet and very dead.
Orchis Fatalis proves that flowers are not a laughing matter; people are willing to kill for a bloom.
Bantling Boy shows what happens when secrets are exposed.
Second Sight argues the merits of ESP and the power of electricity.
Hidden Depths reveals how greed and retribution do not mix well when wine is introduced into the plot.
Sauce for the Goose pits a bird watcher against greedy family members while their poor old mother keeps seeing a hanged man who isn't there.  The eighth and final mystery in this set is Midsomer Rhapsody.  Music can be quite deadly when it falls into the wrong hands.

Throughout these mysteries, Barnaby (John Nettles) plods along picking up stray clues.  His wife keeps trying the odd recipe and conspires to buy a boat they don't need.  Their daughter Cully still hasn't settled on a profession.  And DS Dan Scott decides to call it quits",1459382400,,1110,4.6091370558375635

6230111,5,B00HW0OSPO,"I love the Midsomer series, especially with John Nettles.  Those ""modernists"" who proclaim mysteries belong in urban areas and only there are here proven arrogant and, worse, wrong!  Midsomer has a feel, an aura, a sense of place that whirls in its own climate.  Maybe Chief Inspector Barnaby  can't hail a cab with the ease of his urban counterparts, but this is Midsomer territory -- who needs a cab!",1420243200,2,402,4.782608695652174

6230113,5,B00HW0OSPO,"I just love this series, with its complex plots that one can enjoy seeing again and again, and still might miss some of the details. I bought this one in particular because it is one of the few places where ""Midsomer Rhapsody"" is on.  I searched and searched for the music for the Rhapsody, and unfortunately, one of the few places I found it was out of stock permanently.  Midsomer Murder Series ran for many seasons, but we in the US have only recently been privileged to view many of the series on PBS.  The plots and the music are always beautifully executed.",1418515200,3,563,4.446601941747573

6230116,5,B00HW0OSPO,"Anglophiles should enjoy this fairly cosy English mystery series Midsomer Murders. Based upon books by Caroline Graham, it follows the sleuthing of a very likable Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles). You get to know his wife Joyce ( Jane Wymark) and his daughter Cully, (Laura Howard). Most of the time you follow Barnaby and his partner around to the bucolic villages and towns of central England as he finds out why seemingly perfectly normal villagers might inspire each other to murder. Most of the murders aren't too grisly, so you will sleep at night. I watch these for scenery as much as anything else. You get insight into the culture of small British hamlets, the architecture and interior design of modest English homes and a few manors thrown in for good measure. If you appreciate British mystery shows, you should enjoy the many jaunts these crimes take the detectives on.  These are great fun to watch while on the treadmill as the time passes quickly with the fetching scenery and suspenseful plots.",1411171200,3,1021,4.901734104046243
6230117,5,B00HW0OSPO,"Midsomer Murders and their on-going regular cast members is the favorite Britsh series in this house hold.

Throw in great story lines and a bit f humor and take it all with a grain of salt and you have something you can watch over and over.",1410307200,,348,4.4375
