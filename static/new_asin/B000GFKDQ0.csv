8131396,5,B000GFKDQ0,"Pros: This is a good video to get if you are thinking about getting into quick inductions. I like Tom's style. He is confident in what he does, and, his love for sharing his knowledge with others is apparent.

I would recommend getting this set if you are starting out, or, are currently only using longer script inductions in your practice.

The Cons: The vids are shot during a workshop, and, include the practice time that the students use to try them out. IMHO its a waste of time.

Tom voices a lot of his own thoughts and personal opinions during his explanations, so much so that he goes off on tangents right in the middle of the inductions. Again, this pads the vids.

Cut all of that out, and you could probably fit everything left onto one DVD.

Other than that, arming yourself with the remote to fast fwd, you will learn a lot!",1220054400,,840,4.393548387096774
