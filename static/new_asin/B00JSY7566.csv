6389915,5,B00JSY7566,Very happy and bonus was getting the ability to add all six movies to my Flixter account,1438646400,,88,4.235294117647059
6389916,3,B00JSY7566,gotta love old movies,1435017600,,21,4.5
6389917,1,B00JSY7566,"NO discs included at all; I got an empty case save for two pieces of paper. I got this in the mail two days ago and didn't open it until tonight, figuring I could lay down and watch The Pest for the first time in years. Um, nope. Apparently not. Removed the plastic wrap and imagine my surprise when I saw nothing inside but two slips of paper. (Purchased NEW from ""Amazon.com LLC"")

Very disappointed!",1513296000,,402,4.36
6389918,4,B00JSY7566,"There is one reason to purchase this set.

""Mixed Nuts"" is anamorphic WS.  Sony ""wisely"" saw to cut that version from the stand-alone release and make it P&S only.  This release is the only one currently available to feature this film in true WS.  If you've never seen it, you should.  It's among the ""lost"" holiday classics and the only film in the set worth the current selling price all by itself.

There are 3 discs, 2 movies per disc, and surprisingly not overly compressed with a more than acceptable image.  Each film has subtitles available.  They are stacked on a single hub inside the case.  That's the reason for only 4 stars.",1511740800,7,637,4.566371681415929
6389919,5,B00JSY7566,"I also purchased this just for So I Married An Ax Murderer.  Excellent, hidden gem of a movie!  Bewitched wasn't as awful as I had heard; Shirley M was great as Endora , Aunt Clara was spot on and Steve C put alot of effort into getting Uncle Arthur's moves down.  Love Beverly Hills Ninja for Chris F Chris R.  Haven't watched others yet; if they suck, who cares?",1503100800,,364,4.231884057971015

6389921,2,B00JSY7566,"I personally love the plots but if I'd known this seller was JUST another copier,I wouldn't have gave em ma business. The films all say: CLOSED CAPTIONS AVAILABLE but I couldn't choose any subtitles...",1499990400,,201,4.9411764705882355

8653791,4,B00JSY7566,I bought for The Pest.  I watched The Pest and it was not a high quality movie nor was the sound impressive.  But it's an action comedy so the quality was adequate and I enjoyed the movie.,1530144000,,188,4.054054054054054

8653794,5,B00JSY7566,These where great. The quality of each film Varys but thats not the seller its just the production company. Pest is clearly a VHS rip. But I owned the dvd a long time ago and it was the same. Got this to replace it after I lost it. But hot bonus! All six come with digital copy! Bam! Worth every penny!,1525564800,,302,3.9672131147540983
