Some noted that the individual discs would not play where you left off (they started over) and you couldn't pick a certain episode. This was not true with my set. The menu is a little confusing, as the highlighted choice is not very obvious. Look closely. The highlighted choice actually becomes grey from a faint blue, the opposite of what one would expect. When ""Episodes"" becomes highlighted with grey, press the UP arrow to bring up the individual show choices. This is a minor inconvenience, as the price of the set can't be beat.",1500595200,,667,4.7094017094017095

7548530,3,B018I8RG5C,The store is fine. However Blu-ray DVDs have a problem. If I stop it then later it starts from the beginning. When I play a regular DVD then my DVD player remembers where I stopped. Maybe it wants me to watch its warning that I will be punished severely if I will copy that DVD?

7548562,4,B018I8RG5C,"Most important... yes it is a U.K. Version but Yes it Will Play on most USA blue ray devices including a blue ray disc drive for the computer. That being said... the menus sucks.  Granted, this issue is not enough to send the discs back but are simply an irritation and make it harder to watch the shows in order. Episodes are not on the menu list in order, do not auto play in order of release from one episode to the other, and do not have the episode titles or the episode numbers listed.
So far, I have had no problem with ""grainy"" or ""unplayable"" episodes (though I am admittedly still on the first disc).
I would say that the value outweighs any problems I have with this product.",1494892800,4,686,4.276923076923077

7548590,5,B018I8RG5C,"I, too, was concerned that this set would work in the US zone.  But these discs work in the Blu-Ray format.  Other reviewers have described the distribution of the seasons by discs numbers.

Each season has the traditional ""gag reel"" and other special features, such as appearances at Comic-Con, tours of the set, and interviews with the cast about their character and their relationships.  The appearances of special guests, such as James Earl Jones and Bob Newhart are given small features. Also provided is a touching tribute to Carol Ann Susi, who provided the voice of the unseen Mrs. Wolowitz; she passed in November 2014 and her death prompted the decision to retire the character on the show.

If I have one complaint, it's the on-screen menus.  For selection of episodes or special features, there is a small, round icon; a portion of the icon changes color when selected.  It can be hard to see.",1491436800,2,905,4.8
7548591,4,B018I8RG5C,"Fantastic set for it's price. I've watched season 1 - 5 so far. No video or audio issues/playback issues in general. The pack groups Season 1 - 3 in one case. Season 2 - 6 in another case, and then individual cases for 7 - 9. I have not come across any broken pieces of the cases and each of the cases lays out all the episodes in the inside of the sleeve.

I gave it 4-stars mostly because of the menu system incorporated. Season 1 menus are absolutely atrocious. It looks like a mess and the highlight colors are just awful to see what you're on. There is a vastly stark difference going to Season 2 and beyond. Although similar menu structure, the colors are night & day clear and easy to use. Also all 24 episodes for a season show up no matter what disc you have in for a season; you just won't be able to play them and instead will be prompted to change discs.

A final bit of a nitpick (I'm not necessarily counting against) is the episode selection tends to just continue playing all episodes after in succession instead of going to menu. I think this sort of defeats the point of having a ""play all"" and ""selection an episode"" options.",1491350400,2,1144,4.267281105990784

7548593,5,B018I8RG5C,"This collection is top notch.  All the discs and cases arrived in perfect shape, and the discs played on U.S. player without a hitch.  The one small snag which caused me to say ""almost"" perfect was the menu design for season one.  Items are indicated as ""selected"" by a difference in color between the ""selected"" choice and others ""not selected.""  At first, I thought the ""menu"" function wasn't working at all because the fool who designed the menu decided to use ""light blue-gray"" and ""light gray-blue"" as the color ""difference.""  Unless you look with extreme care, you can't see a change, and you might believe, as I did, that nothing is happening when you punch the remote buttons.  When I saw how season two worked, I realized how the menus operate, and everything went fine from there.  This set is a great value, and I highly recommend it.",1491264000,3,845,4.668918918918919

7548643,5,B018I8RG5C,"I just received this in the mail today and watched the pilot to make sure everything is functional.  It is!

This is an excellent way to catch up on 'The Big Bang Theory' in as high a video quality as possible.  Although this set is made in the UK by Warner Bros., the discs play perfectly here on my consumer Sony Blu-Ray player here in the U.S.  The discs are packaged in five packs:  Seasons 1-3, 4-6, 7, 8, and 9.  Each season, regardless of how it is packaged, encompasses two Blu-Ray discs, making a total of 18 discs in the entire boxed set.  The five packs are packaged in a full-color cardboard box, with a full-color cardboard sleeve over that.  The inner art of each pack details each episode's credits and summary.  It may be difficult to read given the blue plastic packaging, but you can easily slide it out to read it,  The cover art of the first three packs is exactly the same, as if to make this Season 1-9 set they took a boxed set made for Seasons 1-7 and added space for the seasons 8 and 9. For those of you concerned with parental ratings, curiously the boxed set is rated for viewers age 15+, while each season's packaging says age 12+.

The video of the pilot episode I viewed was a bit grainy, but it didn't detract from the high definition video at all, and I expect the video quality of the rest of the series would get even better as they go along.  It's still far and away better than any DVD presentation!

Given the low price of this set, I recommend snatching it up while you can.  You won't be disappointed and it's a great value.",1487635200,,1564,4.275510204081633

7548649,4,B018I8RG5C,Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase. 9 seasons of an incredibly popular tv show for only $75? I'll take it! I took off one star because the first couple of seasons which I have watched so far don't seem to have the high definition quality of my other Blu-ray Discs. The quality has been more like a DVD which is fine. I won't complain with the great price of these!,1486944000,,374,4.208333333333333
7548650,3,B018I8RG5C,"As far as the show itself, I love it. But I had a problem playing a couple of the disks, and if you stop them mid season, when you return to watching them it brings you to the beginning of the disc.",1486771200,10,198,3.738095238095238

7548654,5,B018I8RG5C,"The DVDs play without any problems, picture quality is amazing. GREAT Price! The only (small) thing is the episode selection buttons don't really show you which one you are trying to select. Its so subtle, its hard to tell. But this is a minor thing compared to the quality of this boxed set. I am VERY happy with this purchase!",1486598400,9,328,4.483333333333333
7548655,5,B018I8RG5C,"I bought these so i could watch them through in order and these are great!  Arrived in perfect condition wraped in plastic just like at the stores. This is by far the best deal for 9 seasons of The Big Bang Theory. Walmart wanted over 180$ for the 9 seasons individualy. To by them on any streaming device was 25$ and up for any season. You will not find a better deal on a great quality set. I order a lot of things from the UK like text books and movies because they are so much cheaper than they are in the USA and they are the same product.  Plays great in my Blu-ray player with no issues disk are brand new, not sure why some people's sets are all busted up but I would blame ur local carrier for that not the distribution company because they look like they were handled rough.",1486512000,4,784,4.117647058823529

7548660,5,B018I8RG5C,"Be not afraid! The description may say it's 1 disc, and some of the reviews may state it's 5 discs, but it's actually 18 (2 per season). Inside the box, there are 5 Bluray cases. Inside the first case (seasons 1-3), there are 6 discs. Second case (seasons 4-6), again 6 discs. Third-Fifth cases are each one season each (7, 8, 9), again 2 discs per season.

On average, there are 12 episodes per disc (S1 is only 17 ep total), so the quality is actually pretty good, and you get full 1080P and DTS HD Master Audio. There are also quite a few special features per season (including a gag reel). I was expecting it to be stripped down and/or low quality, but color me surprised.

Also, it works perfectly on US Bluray players, and looks exactly the same as the US broadcast of the show (I would have thought they would be PAL standard - maybe that's not a thing on Blurays anymore).",1486080000,7,880,4.327272727272727

7548687,4,B018I8RG5C,"While I appreciate that these are, ultimately, playable, we've run into some glitches. Despite updating our Blu-Ray players (which were fine, it turns out, and had never failed us in the past), the playability of these disks is a bit dicey. You can view them -- fear not -- but if you want to PAUSE and later resume, good luck. The disks tend to freeze up and need total revamping, a royal pain if you're well into a given disc. We also get bizarre error messages, like READ DISK 2 (when we're still on disk 1) and such.

Not ideal, but not a deal buster. But if you like scene selection or any control whatsoever over what you're going to watch, BEWARE.

I was concerned because on the DVDs there's a seal printed that says, ""Irish Film Classification Office"", but I can confirm that this Blu-ray set worked in my PS3. Further research shows me that while Blu-ray players must be region specific, Blu-ray discs are often NOT locked to a specific region the way DVDs have been.

The quality is amazing, and there are a LOT of episodes per disc which I love. I hate getting series discs with 3-4 episodes per disc. This set has 2 Blu-ray discs per season. It's fairly compact as a result. Overall, a really awesome and economical purchase compared to purchasing the seasons separately.",1481500800,53,665,4.732758620689655
