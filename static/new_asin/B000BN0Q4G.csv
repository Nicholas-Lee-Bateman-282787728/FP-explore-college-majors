2425416,5,B000BN0Q4G,"I probably saw this when I was six, but I know I loved it and there was the boy who was really a star, and to get back in the sky with his family, Big Bird had to put his feather on a scale. And Snuffy still wasn't real in this movie! I want it on DVD, just like The Bunny Picnic and The Christmas Toy.",1163376000,,302,3.590909090909091
8089149,4,B000BN0Q4G,"Our daughter loved this film. If you have a VHS player, then the version sold here is fine, however search for a company called musefilm dot org, which is the official distributor for this production. I myself have no relationship with this organization.",1504483200,,254,4.930232558139535

8089151,4,B000BN0Q4G,"This is a wonderful program, and I cannot understand why it hs never been released on DVD. Would LOVE to see this out in DVD format!",1400371200,,132,4.115384615384615
8089152,5,B000BN0Q4G,"This is a delightful Sesame Street story, filmed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art with charming story and a tour of the Met's pictures.  Wonderful for children 3 years and up.",1359676800,,176,4.67741935483871
8089153,5,B000BN0Q4G,"I love it, my son wasn't quite so sure.  It is old enough that Mr. Snuffleupagus was still invisible.  Still he liked all the characters especially Cookie Monster.",1355961600,,163,4.785714285714286
8089154,5,B000BN0Q4G,"Drat I wish this were available in DVD format. My tape is worn out. I have used this tape with my first grade classrooms, as we study ancient Egypt coloring sheets. Due to this movie I made a trip to the Met myself to see the Temple of Vendor !!  This movie, with it's talk about them becoming stars in the sky when they die, and being 'judged' by weighing a feather -why these are fabulously deep art topics for young children. Gives them a lot to think about. Plus, they learn that art is about culture and communication and deep thoughts which we can all interpret in our own ways (p.e. Egypt was before Jesus was born! Which I have to remidn some of the parents about before they accuse me of teaching something that doesn't agree with church !  My classes nearly cry with happiness as the little boy joins his parents to be ""stars in the sky"" upon death. Lots of images of great sculptures too. The kids relate to the characters very well, especially the crying little boy. A bit of unnecessary fluff, like too long of songs and mimicking a knightin armor, but still.... this movie is an amazing classic. Plus, children learn to NOT TOUCH the art at the museum ! A very good lesson !  When my students went to the local county fair and saw the ride with ancient Pharoh's on it, they were ecstatic due to the recognition of the culture they learned about in art class !!! This video, however old, 1987 is still a total must for teachers from lower elementary. It is not aged in any way at all.",1345507200,,1497,4.320284697508897
8089155,4,B000BN0Q4G,"I never saw this special during my childhood, which in retrospect was really too bad. Now that I have a four year old son, I love finding ""pre-Elmo"" Sesame Street productions for him to watch. This is a fun special - In a nutshell, thanks to Big Bird, the Sesame Street folks find themselves locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At this point, various characters start having their own adventures: Oscar becomes enamored with the museum's collection of ancient Greek statues, believing them to be beautiful ""trash"" because they are missing limbs, noses, heads, etc.; Bob is forced to thwart Cookie Monster's desire to eat a painting by Paul Cezanne and other works of art; Super Grover tries to make friends with a suit of armor, thinking that it's a real person; and Big Bird along with Mr. Snuffleupagus help a 4006 and one-half year old, cursed Egyptian boy (who presumably lives by day as a mummy in the museum) solve an ancient riddle so that he can transform into a star and live with his parents in the night sky.
Admittedly, the Egyptian portion of the special is a bit odd; they continually make reference to the ""demon"" (played by actor James Mason) that arrives at stroke of midnight to pose the riddle's question to the Egyptian boy, as well as Osiris (the god of the underworld) who poses the final challenge to the boy's ascension. I thought this segment was great, but I never thought I would hear the word ""demon"" uttered by Big Bird - Maybe they should start having him call Elmo a ""little red demon!"" (Just Kidding).
As with nearly everyone else who reviewed this special, I really wish that it was available on DVD. However, if I must purchase a used VHS copy, I will do so.",1332547200,,1708,4.60327868852459

8089157,5,B000BN0Q4G,"There is a classic line from Oscar the Grouch that I love to pass along to all my artist friends.

I told you if we stopped to look at the pictures, we'd never get through the place!",1254614400,,182,3.918918918918919
8089158,5,B000BN0Q4G,"Because of this amazing movie, I have always had a deep and enduring love of fine art and museums.  I was the only five year-old who was able to identify Paul Cezanne's work on sight, and who begged her mother at the age of ten to see the Temple of Dendur when they visited New York City.  Seti can be a little frightening for small children, mostly because of the crazy makeup, thunderous voice, and portentous music whenever he's mentioned, but I loved this so much as a child, I would simply watch with a blanket to put over my head when he appears at the end.",1184544000,,563,4.252336448598131
