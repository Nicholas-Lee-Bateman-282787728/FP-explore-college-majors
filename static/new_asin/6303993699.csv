7857975,5,6303993699,"Plot:  Data is giving a report to Commander Maddox about how he deals with situations on the Enterprise in general, whether relationships (dealing with being Keiko's ""father of the bride""), ship operations and missions (Ambassador T'Pau and the Romulans), personal interests (Spot), etc.  There techically two sub-plots put into one major plot, essentially combined by hearing Data's personal journal (more or less).  One plot is about the Miles O'Brian/Keiko wedding with Data caught inbetween (pretty funny), and the other being involved with the Vulcan Ambassador T'Pau and her mission involving the Romulans.

Watch for some pretty humorous issues, not including:  Dr. Crusher past involving tap dancing, Data experimenting with friendly jibes and insults, etc.

Very good episode, with plenty of hilarity and seriousness.",1157846400,,826,5.67479674796748
7857976,5,6303993699,"I love this episode! ""Data's Day"" is TNG writing at its best. Behind the simple premise lies a very complex character study of the seemingly ""emotionless"" android, Data.  Make no mistake, even  though ""Data's Day"" is charming and very, very funny, it's also  quite revealing.
Over the course of the series, Data as a character  desparately strives to become more ""human.""  This episode  illustrates the point that even though he is an android, Data posesses  fundemental traits that define ""humanity.""  He has a great  capacity for forgiveness (""Data's Day"" is a letter to Bruce  Maddox, the man who wanted to deactivate and disect him), compassion (we're  introduced to Data's cat, Spot) and friendship. We should all be so  human.
""Data's Day"" shows up on a lot of TNG Top 10 Best  Episode lists. Definitely makes my personal Top 10. All-around great  episode. Excellent writing. Spiner's acting is solid as always. Tons of  fodder for trivia buffs.
Things to watch for: Spot; The Dancing Doctor;  Worf & the crystal swan; Keiko and Miles; and last but not least, The  Ersatz Vulcan",951004800,6,1084,4.933333333333334
