2690736,4,B000KGGZU8,"First off, I've been a huge martial arts movie fan in general, and a Shaw Brothers fan in particular since I was a kid when I used to watch Drive-In Movie on Saturday afternoon.  All I can say is God bless Image Entertainment.  Getting your hands on decent versions of Shaw Brothers' classics in the past were very frustrating.  Celestial Pictures (thanks to Vee King Shaw) made the right move totally restoring these classics.  Unfortunately, they were only Region 3 and could only be bought through a HK website.  I know Red Sun was doing a great job at restoring and releasing SB flicks (just ask the Morgoth dude), but I could never find them.  Now we have Image, yes!

The movie itself is the second film the godfather of HK cinema, Chang Cheh, made with his ""first team"", which mainly consisted of Ti Lung & David Chiang.  It's the usual Chang classic involving brotherhood, intrigue, honor, bloodshed (lots of it), chivalry and redemption.  I'm not going to go into the plot because it's already given in the editorial review & product description.  Let me just say that it's a period piece, and the choreography is old-school.  The choreography isn't bad, but it lacks the finesse of Bruce Lee (who came later), and it lacks the quickness and precision of the Venoms, Jackie Chan, Samo Hung or Jet Li.  So what, it's a great film.

Now as for the DVD, crystal clear picture - really shows the glossy SB cinematography, perfect widescreen, original Mandarin language track and remastered subtitles.  If you like Chang Cheh, Shaw Brothers and old-school fu (like me) get this.  This is definitely the way these films should be seen.  That goes for ""The Wandering Swordsman"", ""The Water Margin"" & ""Legendary Weapons of China"".  I'm sure the Morgoth dude concurs.",1174003200,3,1767,4.778877887788779
8156625,4,B000KGGZU8,"Movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles.  This is a very artsy movie that includes romance, sword fights, jealousy and good vs. bad.  This movie has the feel of cowboy movies.  A loner travels through a town on his horse and he's low on cash and is a good guy.  The town has a security company that has to transport $200,000 to the capital for the government.  The owner of the company is an old man named Ko Fong, who normally can fend off anyone.  Outside the town is a bandit that is stationed at a pagoda tower waiting for the opportunity to attach the security transport.  However, this time around Mr. Ko Fong is sick and lost his ability to fight, but he doesn't want anyone to know because that would weaken the company's reputation and would cause bandits to pounce on his transports.  To keep his secret, he brings on his niece and her boyfriend on the journey as they are highly skilled fighters who can substitute for him.  However, his niece, not confident that they can truly protect the convoy invites the loner to help them.  The loner complies as he likes her and she's into him, but this creates jealousy with the boyfriend, so the love triangle creates friction withing the company while still having to protect the loot.",1520640000,,1244,4.538116591928251
8156626,4,B000KGGZU8,"This is a good old-fashioned movie in the style of wu-chia, full of sword fighting, flying, and, needless to say, a bit of romance.
With these kinds of films, it may take a little while to catch on to the plot; I don't know whether it would be easier to view it in the original language and not have to rely on captions. But give it twenty minutes, and the states of affairs will become clear. Without giving away anything obvious, the plot centers on the transportation of a rather sizeable amount of money, the various people whose mission it is to protect it, and the robbers who want to make off with it.
If by the second half you have already figured out the most likely ending, you're probably right, but it isn't really obvious for the characters of the script, and I won't tell you what it is. The fight scenes are great. Of course, they're improbable, if not impossible. That's what wu-chia is all about. The highly improbable must becomes the possible after all.

In this connection, it might be helpful to point out that, although the characters refers to their skills in martial arts as ""kung fu,"" films in the wu-chia  goes far beyond the venerable style of of the original Shaolin methods of unarmed go far beyond fighting without weapons.
Wu-chia is the style that was most dominant for Hong Kong films prior to the advent and hey-day of strictly Kung Fu films, spearheaded by Bruce Lee. Jet Li and Jackie Chan, among others, continued that style, but with the advent of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and the re-issue of Iron Monkey, wu-chia has made a big comeback.
Once you've caught on to the plot, it seems to be pretty straight-forward, but there are a sufficient number of scenarios to keep you on your toes and not take anything fro granted. Defying all medical odds, injuries that you and I would consider to be fatal wounds , will not inhibit a central character to continue to fight his heart out.
The subtitles aren't perfect, but not to far from the ideal.
I've seen a few reviewers of Hong Kong films refer wu-chia as ""wire fu,"" a really ignorant description and that's revealing of the character of some of the reviewers. If you spend an entire rainy Sunday afternoon going through a Hong Kong film trying to find the one place where a wire might actually show up, I wish you the opportunity to make a little bit more your life.
Overall a very nice film though not in the class of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li. A wu-chia director and easily make use of wu-chia devices to get a character out of a spot of trouble without exerting his fighting techniques.
Overall, a nice addition to the ever-increasing wu-chia films, but don't a Crouching Tiger.",1506470400,,2681,4.560165975103734

8156631,5,B000KGGZU8,"This early Chang Cheh movie is highly recommended for fans of high flying, bloody swordplay. It's an overlooked gem that martial arts afficionados will enjoy.",1388016000,,158,5.36
8156632,1,B000KGGZU8,"I found this movie to be somewhat slow moving at first but then the film progresses into some appealing fight scenes. Overall, I really disliked it because of one character in particular, that person would be Yun Piau-piau played by Li Ching. I found her to be very shallow; she goes from speaking of marriage to Siang (Ti Lung), in one scene and then a few later she is mesmerized by David Chiang's character Yi Lo who she eventually falls in love with rather quickly not because he is kind to her or that she has known him as long as Siang. Instead, she falls in love with Yi Lo because his kung fu or swordsmanship is slightly better than Siang's.

From what I perceived from the movie was that the Yi Lo character was supposed to be this loner and from his dialogue, he was not forthright in divulging his past willingly. Yun Piau-piau did not have any in-depth understanding of him so how could she fall for him over someone she trained with for years and was her famed aunt's apprentice? The only true justice that I found in this motion picture was the death of Yi Lo, not because I disliked the character but for the very reason that Yun Piau-piau received what she deserved.

 That is why I prefer other Shaw Brothers films such as ""One-Armed Swordsman"" and ""Return of the One-Armed Swordsman"". For in the first film the main character (Fang Gang) had to make a choice between two women. One his master's spoiled daughter, Pei-er (who was the cause of him losing his arm) who would bring Fang Gang wealth and influence or the simple caring country girl (Hsio Man) that nursed him back to health and provided him with the means to develop his one hand sword style. He rightfully chose the latter of the two and overall the both films ended happily, which we hardly ever see currently. Ultimately, these two pictures promoted the honorable course of action, which ""Have Sword, Will Travel"", failed to accomplish.",1219795200,,1919,4.5726744186046515
8156633,3,B000KGGZU8,"I struggled with the decision to even write this review... the fact that it almost feels sacriligious to rate such a highly respected Shaw Brothers film with 3 stars, not to mention all of the well-written positive reviews for it already make it even harder to explain my viewpoint.  For me this was just a good swordplay film, none of the characters are very likeable or memorable (although I thought the henchman known as ""The Pestilence"" was cool) including our leading man who is the type of character who refuses a piece of silver because of his pride but instead is willing to sell the horse he loves (not that way!) for next to nothing (all while wearing a bow on his forehead)?  David Chiang became a huge star for Shaw Bros. pictures after this but I've never really been completely sold on him as a lead, which probably helps explain why I thought the film was just decent.  The fighting is far from impressive here and normally deteriorates into semi-organized chaos with Chiang leading the way flailing around with even less style than the extras (if you thought Jimmy Wang Yu couldn't fight...).  Chang Cheh still manages to make it a worthwhile time and breaks out the trampoline jumps (that characters often use to enter an exit scenes) and buckets of red paint (err, blood I mean) for the big finale.  I think 3 stars fits this movie perfectly as it's not bad but never really leaves much of an impression either (especially compared to his best like The One-Armed Swordsman, Chinese Super Ninjas, and 5 Deadly Venoms).  ""Have Sword, Will Travel""... great title, okay movie.",1192665600,2,1590,4.722021660649819
8156634,4,B000KGGZU8,"I was so glad to hear that select Shaw Brothers kung-fu films were being released on DVD in the United States...until I got my copy of ""Have Sword, Will Travel"" and the disc started jittering near the end of the movie (specifically, during the scene in which Ku Feng prepares his gang of bandits to attack Ching Miao's caravan as it passes by the old temple). The sound remained intact, but the picture was jerky and unsteady, and--worst of all--it affected the first two or three minutes of the final fight scene. I sent the DVD back and got another copy, only to find that the same error existed in the same exact spot on the new disc.

This has occurred on three different DVD players. Has anyone else gotten a defective copy of ""Have Sword, Will Travel""?",1177200000,6,758,4.492753623188406
