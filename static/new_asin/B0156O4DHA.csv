nonexistence while playing, so youll have to fast forward through the intro and end credits to get to the
next scene. There is a main menu and the option to select whatever episode you wish to watch. Production
quality of the picture was fine. English subtitle feature is secondary. Also, not everything is translated into
English throughout the show. There are various parts involving a diary that are not translated into English.

The plot is simple and the inevitable ending is laid out in the very first episode. Tsukasa Mizugaki
is a new employee who partners with Isla (artificial life form) who has been out of fieldwork for a while
due to faltering performance of her body and mind. Through the process of working together both end up
developing feelings for the other and while Tsukasa is willing to explore the relationship, Isla remains
distant knowing her life is near its end. Because Tsukasa refuses to abandon his partner despite the outcome
Isla decides to start making more memories with him. There is a host of standard supporting characters with
plenty of fluff and comical relief moments throughout that make this a cute story with a touching ending.",1463097600,,1258,4.851162790697674

The show takes place in a futuristic world where many people will purchase androids called Giftias which are loaded with synthetic souls. They look, talk, act and seem just like humans in almost every way, but with one catch, they only have a lifespan of around 9 years. After their shelf life expires, they're collected and their memories and personalities are erased.
The protagonist, Tsukasa joins the organization that collects them and teams up with a giftia named Isla to collect expired giftias.
It's very apparent from even reading a summary of the show that it deals very heavily with the concept of mortality and death and, like in most anime, will have romance mixed in with it.

While it may sound rather dark and depressing, it's actually incredibly light-heated and will make you laugh far more than expected. It shows you that even in dark situations, happiness can and will exist.
I refuse to spoil any of the show, but I will say that the ending WILL make you cry. Not might, will. I always thought The Fault in Our Stars was bittersweet, but this show puts it to shame 10 times over without even trying.

Ratings
Animation: 8 - Very good animation that's actually quite difficult to beat. My only quarrel is that one or two shots left me somewhat confused.
Sound: 10 - Nothing to complain about.
Story: 7 - You will cry many times over. There are some plot holes in the concept such as wonders and why they can't be prevented, but nothing to really complain about all things being considered.

Also, this show is incredibly light on fan service. This means very, very few shots with giant, jiggling breasts being the focal point of a shot and no accidental gropings. You could easily feel comfortable watching this with family, it's PG-13 at worst.",1460851200,,2018,4.628491620111732
