8060659,5,B0009H76KG,Good DVD easily to fallow it would help if you had someone to practice with you other then that it is great I got the whole collection.,1425081600,,135,4.037037037037037
8060660,3,B0009H76KG,"Thought there would be a little more detailed instruction rather than just doing the movements. But useful just the same. Not something you would want to use to learn the wooden dummy, but a good supplement.",1392681600,,207,4.777777777777778
8060661,5,B0009H76KG,"I found that this was a good example of Wing Chun techniques demonstrated on the wooden dummy.  The form is demonstrated well and it is broken down into small enough chunks that it can be absorbed.  Anyone who studies Wing Chun, as well as those outside the family, would find this to be a valuable resource in furthering their understanding of the art.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who studies our style or to those who simply want to know what it is that we do. I've studied the art for 28 years and I got something out of it.",1240272000,4,537,4.245098039215686
8060662,5,B0009H76KG,"I just received this DVD the other day and watched the entire thing. Good picture quality, good angles on the wooden dummy, and good application explanation. The one minor thing the DVD has that makes a huge difference when learning from a DVD is chapters (minus any thumbnail pics of the chapters). I have other wing chun DVDs that don't have chapters and believe me when you try and continue on the DVD where you left off without chapters you have to manually fast forward.  For example the Wing Chun series released by William Cheung (which I also own, recommend, and has good information just no chapters). I intend to purchase the rest of this series if that says anything.",1153008000,3,678,4.65
