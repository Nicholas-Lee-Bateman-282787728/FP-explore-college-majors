8285109,5,B00004XMSO,"This video is definitely worth buying if you have a rebounder at home, it gives you a really good work out and is fun and easy to pick up - the only thing it lacks is a proper cool down session at the end leaving you to do that yourself.  Other than that I would HIGHLY recommend this video, its broken down into 3 sections begineers (also a warm up), intermediate and advanced so you can do all 3 sections or build up.  I always do all 3 and you really know you've worked out!!!!  It gets those endorphins going and burns fat real FAST!! Go for it!",995241600,33,549,4.064814814814815
