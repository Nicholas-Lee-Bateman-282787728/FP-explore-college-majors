1674648,4,B00005Y6YW,"Hidden Hollywood Volume 2 More Treasures from the 20th Century Fox Vaults gives us another ninety minutes of deleted footage that was intended for a movie's theatrical release but instead was left to languish on the cutting room floor. Again, as with the first volume of this two disc series, some of the footage was cut rather mercifully from the final version of a film; but much of it was cut for the wrong reasons.

For example, musical numbers were typical victims when a film ran too long. It was the consensus that a musical number could be cut without damaging the plot; and sometimes they were right. On the other hand, there is a wonderful Charleston dance sequence from Roxie Hart that never should have been cut.

We see just about every star getting some of their best work discarded from the films they starred in. Even the remarkably talented Olympic medalist skater Sonja Henie had some of her best work cast onto the cutting room floor. There is another, more lengthy sequence that is excellent entertainment starring W.C. Fields with Margaret Dumont and Phil Silvers that was cut from Tales Of Manhattan.  What a shame! In addition, look for footage of Alice Faye singing so sweetly in a musical number cut from Rose Of Washington Square. We also see The Ritz Brothers in action as a great comedy team at Fox studios.

There's also an emphasis on film restoration in this second look at discarded footage found the vaults at 20th Century Fox studios. We see computer technicians using graphic design programs to restore tears on old, fragile film and we also see how early color film could turn pink with time. At the time this movie was made in 2000, some restoration of color footage was still prohibitively expensive but I hope that by now cheaper technology has already been able to help us restore and cherish old footage from the vaults.

My only complaint about this DVD is that we only get discarded footage from the vaults at 20th Century Fox studios. If the musical numbers here are good can you imagine what MGM studios might have been able to release to us on DVD? I hope one day we can see much more previously discarded footage from all the movie studios.

Overall, this is an excellent retrospective on DVD of just how hard people work to restore lost movie footage, much of which is actually very entertaining. Joan Collins mostly narrates this rather than hosting it; and the countless clips, sequences and more reveal that not just the trash wound up on the cutting room floor.",1198886400,9,2513,4.687074829931973
1674649,4,B00005Y6YW,"Hidden Hollywood gives us ninety-one minutes of mostly rather good material that wound up cut from films only to lie on the cutting room floor. As host Joan Collins correctly points out, we're lucky we have at least this much! Many early films were simply thrown out; and Hollywood studios never cared about preserving their films until they could sell them to television. How sad! However, what we do get on this DVD is a wonderful 91 minutes of footage from the vaults at 20th Century Fox studios.

Joan Collins introduces the show are then we're off! We get very rarely seen footage including Katherine Hepburn's first screen test from 1932, a host of musical numbers shot both in black and white as well as color, and dramatic scenes considered extraneous or just too objectionable for the times. Most regrettably we see excellent cut footage of Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson cut from the film Caf Metropole in which Bill was to play himself. Ouch! How that must have hurt him.

In fact, no star was truly immune from having their best work cut from a film at 20th Century Fox. Betty Grable footage is here for us to admire; it really should have been included in the final cut. There's footage of Marilyn Monroe doing a musical number with male dancers to support her and I especially liked the Shirley Temple sequences that were cut from her films.

Look also for great footage of Jimmy Durante conducting a vaudevillian team with his nose (!!!), Shirley Temple dancing up a storm with Jimmy Durante, and Ethel Merman performing a number from There's No Business Like Show Business.

We also learn that 20th Century Fox studio head Darryl F. Zanuck believed there was always something that could be cut from the film. He believed that audiences would ""get it"" anyway. Sometimes he was right (they mercifully pulled a Bert Lahr number that just plain stunk) and many times Zanuck was wrong as I point out in this review.

The DVD comes with no extras; all we get is scene selection. However, the quality of the archival footage is remarkably clear and I feel fortunate to have been able to watch this movie on DVD.

My only complaint is that the footage we see is only from 20th Century Fox. I would have loved to see what MGM studios and Warner Brothers cut out from their movies. I am very disappointed; and I will make this a four star review because of this disappointment.

Nevertheless, if you want a great view of what really good material there was that still never made it into the movies that were so popular before the age of television, you can't go wrong with this DVD. Sure, it's only from the vaults of one movie studio but this is a lot better than nothing! I highly recommend this for classic film aficionados, film students and people who enjoy the arts in general.",1198800000,7,2784,4.623481781376518
1674650,5,B00005Y6YW,"In the 1940s B&W musical FOX film, ""DOLL FACE"" Carmen Miranda had

one of her production numbers cut from the film due to the censors at that time. ""She's Always True To The Navy"" was the song Carmen sang with a lighthouse as a hat and wearing a very sexy outfit, this and another musical number of hers that ended unfortunately on the cutting room floor is presented here uncut and a joy! Not only Miranda but many great stars of Hollywoods Golden age is featured on this outstanding DVD...a real treat!",1147219200,8,504,4.478260869565218
1674651,5,B00005Y6YW,"Following the original ""Hidden Hollywood"", this DVD gathers more outtakes from the films of Fox and the fascination continues with how they fit into the films and why they were removed. Joan Collins is back and narrates with her superb soft English accent and perfect diction.

In most if not all cases, the cuts were not ""Director's cuts"". Darryl F Zanuck exercised great control over the Fox product and most cuts were made between preview and release, usually for running time reasons,  slowing down the action or sometimes due to censor objections.

The outtakes contain comedy sequences as well as musical numbers. The highlights of the former are Danny Kaye singing ""Begin the Beguine"" offkey from ""On the Riviera"" and W C Fields long lost sequence from ""Tales of Manhattan"", a really hilarious skit which should have been released as a short film. Of the latter, Alice Faye's rendition of ""I'll see you in my Dreams"" captures her vocal and visual appeal perfectly.  She stands in front of a piano with a back up quartet and sings - no special effects, no embellishment, just raw talent. She is memorable.

The prints of the outtakes are pristine since they have been cut from original negatives. In fact, if they were inserted into the films, sometimes they would be better than the surrounding film!",1140566400,13,1307,4.86936936936937
1674652,5,B00005Y6YW,"Darryl Zanuck, head of production at Fox, was famous for his editing skills.  This DVD contains outtakes from many famous Fox films, trimmed sometimes for censorship or even political reasons or maybe simply to reduce the running time.

If you know the films, you can mentally piece the outtakes into the originals. Some of the numbers are pretty awful such as Bert Lahr's incomprehensible song. Others are memorable like Jimmy Durante's number with Shirley Temple and Alice Faye's ""I'm Always Chasing Rainbows"". It is also amusing to see the performers grimace and pout as the camera starts to roll. The DVD is a gold mine to the film buff and since the material has been taken from original negatives and restored, it is in great condition.

The DVD is partly documentary as narrated by Joan Collins. Whatever you might think of Collins as a performer, she has a beautiful English accent with perfect diction. Her delivery is music to the ears and the script is informative but succinct.",1140566400,33,989,4.875
1674653,5,B00005Y6YW,"For years I have been more than familier with the 1943 Fox musical THE GANG'S ALL HERE directed by Busby Berkeley. But it was fascinating to see an outtake of a comedy sequence intended for late in the film, with Phil Baker doing a takeoff of his popular radio quiz show ""Take it Or Leave it"". Charlotte Greenwood slides down a bannister and lands behind a giant picture frame in an imitation of Whistler's Mother, in a bit of physical comedy almost broader than anything left in the final cut of the film, except-Charlotte Greenwood, doing her usual high kicking bit.",1087516800,12,568,4.633663366336633
1674654,5,B00005Y6YW,"Anyone who enjoys old films should be tickled pink to find these bits trimmed from the final cut of 1930-1940 films are still in existence. 20th Century Fox, as most studios, threw gold into the garbage. But these survived somehow.
Shirley Temple - that little bundle of talent - does a number with the great Jimmy Durante. It was cut because the studio decided Shirley doing a Durante impersonation did not fit her image. There is a lot of good stuff on this disc, cut for time because it is easy to cut a musical number or, as in Shirleys case, it does not fit the stars image. I thoroughly enjoyed this chance to see these scenes.
I have to mention the Bert Lahr number: you have to see it to believe it. There is far too little of Bert Lahr on film and this is a chance to see him as a young Broadway style performer even if you can't figure out just what it is he is doing.
If you like old movies or musicals this disc is for you.",1037923200,49,935,4.142857142857143

7956333,4,B00005Y6YW,"I bought this DVD primarily for the 13 minute W.C. Fields sequence that was cut from ""Tales of Manhattan"".  That movie was a series of vignettes featuring Fox stars of the early 40s, linked by a tailcoat that moved from individual to individual. The Fields scene was cut in its entirety so it is a complete short story that stands alone.  Therefore, it differs from the other ""cuts"" in Hidden Hollywood, which are largely scenes or musical numbers that were taken out for timing or censorship reasons in the final release.  The DVD is an AMC release (which I assume was televised at some time) narrated by Joan Collins.  In addition to the Fields sequence which is very funny, there are a number of good musical numbers from ""Four Jills and a Jeep"" and an incredible dance scene by the Nicholas Brothers cut, along with most of the scene of the scantily dressed harem, from ""Sheik of Araby"".  It also features some interesting outtakes as brilliant performers like Ginger Rogers try to perfect incredibly complex dance routines and as Buster Keaton and Alice Fay rehearse pie-in-the-face routines.  Who also can fail to admire Carmen Miranda as she sings about the navy with a lighthouse for a hat?
Programs like this make you wonder how many more brilliant performances were lost due to the perceived pressures of running time or the ridiculous rules of the censor.",1389484800,6,1366,4.791489361702127
7956334,5,B00005Y6YW,"I was intrigued by the description of this DVD since I had seen most of the movies when I was a kid.  It was fun to recall many of the movie incidences and then see the alternate scenes that were not used because of goofs, flubs or just accidental things that happened.  The W.C. Fields story that was left out of ""Tales"" was a surprise to me, as I had never read about it.  It was added fun to see Fields ignoring the director's points in some of the rejected parts of the movie story.

I would recommend this DVD to movie buffs, especially those who like musicals, comedies and lighthearted features.

7956335,4,B00005Y6YW,"This contains several short scenes that were cut from various movies, all 20th Century Fox products.  My son gave me this for Christmas, getting it from my Wish List.  As a Ginger Rogers scholar, I wanted this for the Charleston dance she performed in the movie ""Roxie Hart.""  Also was glad that this contained a dropped episode from ""Tales of Manhattan.""  Of course, the excerpts are of varied quality.  As long as you don't expect too much, this will be a good addition to a collections of '30s through '50s movies.",1293321600,2,517,4.637362637362638

7956337,3,B00005Y6YW,"First of all, I'm a little confused as at least half the crits on this page refer to Hidden Hollywood 2.  I'm writing about the original Hidden Hollywood, and that's what makes me the Odd Man Out, as I seem to be the only one who doesn't think it was worth the money.  I'd say there was around half an hour of interesting material in this compilation - the clips involving Grable, Faye, and Merman/Dailey/Gaynor/O'Connor, Bojangles/Shirley Temple, and an interesting account of how ""Hot Spot"" became ""I Wake Up Screaming"" merely by eliminating Betty Grable's songs and making her a stenographer.  From musical to cinema noir with a clip of the scissors.  The rest of the stuff should have stayed on the cutting room floor...sequences such as the incomprehensible Bert Lahr number, the so-called comedy duo Weber and Fields, and the painful resurrection of a quiz sequence conducted by Phil Baker who had no looks, no charisma, and certainly no visible talent.  This out-take from ""The Gang's All Here"" makes one wonder why he was in it anyway, and why more of his dreary contribution to that otherwise entertaining extravaganza wasn't cut out too.  There's also a yawn-inducing sequence from the otherwise sparkling We're Not Married - no wonder it was cut.  Hope Emerson dragging herself around an obvious studio bayou set isn't my idea of entertainment. Yet another example of the dull padding in what promised to be a scintillating collection.  Maybe we've been spoiled by MGM.  To cap everything, this cheap compilation doesn't even have a menu with a scene selection feature, which is absolutely necessary when there's so much to skip over.  Oh yes, and we have a heavily-pancaked Joan Collins prowling the archive aisles with a laughable slink, and displaying all the warmth of a pair of eyebrow tweezers.",1230336000,7,1811,4.947194719471947
