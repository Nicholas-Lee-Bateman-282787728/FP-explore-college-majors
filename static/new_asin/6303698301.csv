7853633,5,6303698301,"this was my first indigo girls video to watch.  me and my 2 die hard's were delighted to find it at a local video store for $1.99 to rent.  it was the climax of my falling in love with the indigo girls.  for all of us.  the home video clips are priceless.  closer to fine video- with a home made look and amy's torn jeans.  in this song amy and emily are walking around sidewalks and the backs of buildings with their guitars, playing singing and walking at the same time.  amy trips over a step and they both laugh and keep playing.  it's good that they didn't cut that out.  the interviews are of great value to any real fan, and contain interesting personal information about amy and emily.  another songs video has amy and emily's quotes printed on the screen and they are real good ones.",1006300800,14,792,4.29054054054054
