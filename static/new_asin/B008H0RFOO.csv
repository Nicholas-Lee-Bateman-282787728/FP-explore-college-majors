8527808,2,B008H0RFOO,"I purchased this tape in June 2013 for $99.99 at this website, which was advertised as ""Introduction to Transcendental Meditation BY Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (Actor)"".  Because of the website description and the price, I thought this would probably be a full lecture given by the Maharishi himself and perhaps a collectors item.

However, I was disappointed to find this is a only a 26-minute promotional tape for TM with various narrators/experts discussing TM's benefits, like lessening stress and anxiety, better creativity and concentration, cardiovascular benefits, etc.

The Maharishi himself appears twice, in a 1-min segment mentioning how the mind will ""calm like a wave"" during meditation, and another 1 1/2-min. segment to speak of how the whole world will benefit in happiness from TM practice.

The transcendental meditation technique is not taught on the tape, but contact information is given at the end.

I took the TM course back in the 1970's along with other university students when it cost around $150, and have enjoyed the meditation technique off and on since then, though I understand the price for the TM course is now drastically higher.

If you are looking into Eastern meditations generally, there are a number of lectures, freely and wonderfully given by the Dalai Lama himself as well as other Zen Buddhist and yogi experts, easily purchased on DVD or available from Netflix.

I was able to return this tape for a full refund, and have given it the two stars for it being just a good presentation of the benefits of Transcendental Meditation.

Post script:  I also purchased a DVD called ""Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sage for New Generation"" by Alan Waite, which you may really like if you are looking for a REAL memorabilia documentary, mainly showing the Maharishi himself, in person, in various settings giving his talks, and full of 1970's nostalgia.  Mr. Waite himself, who completed this documentary in 1969, will actually be the one to send the film to you, He includes a paper sheet with nostalgic photos.  The DVD also includes the same-film-with-running-commentary and a nicely done photo gallery.  Highly recommended for any Maharish fans.  This film also NOT teach the TM technique.",1371254400,3,2216,5.105263157894737
