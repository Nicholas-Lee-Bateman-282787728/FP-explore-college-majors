7893409,3,6305701288,"I used this in my high school art classroom.  It was not as good as others I've used about Dali.  Mixture of subtitles and English broke the flow. I would have liked to see more about his work, more samples of his work and less of his history. Good for viewing out of interest in Dali, just not too enthralling for students (of course, they can be a tough audience).",1300492800,4,366,4.214285714285714
7893410,3,6305701288,Audio is not good enough and somehow it is a little bit to dark.,1123977600,4,64,3.642857142857143
7893411,5,6305701288,"This documentary should equally satisfy those already familiar with Dali and those who know nothing about him.  I can't imagine anyone not being entertained by this display of Dali's unique personality.  Passionate admires of Dali may find it difficult to view the footage of the Divine Dali not looking so divine in the 80's.  A huge plus is the sub-titles even when Dali is speaking in English.  Some important people are interviewed such as Man Ray, Max Ernst and Albert Field (author of the must have Official Catalog of the Graphic Works of Salvador Dali) among others.  I saw this documentary two nights in a row and enjoyed it just as much the second time around.",1092182400,7,670,4.741379310344827

7893413,5,6305701288,"My friend Deanali(now following in the footsteps of the great Dali)got me influenced in Dali. After watching this video I am so impressed and there are very few artists alive today that are able to match the late Salvador Dali. This is a must see for all. Thank you, Mary",1028246400,3,271,4.44
7893414,4,6305701288,"I'm not sure why the the DVD says black and white (a black and white documentary about an artist makes as much sense as a documentary about Beethoven with no sound). Although the DVD offers nothing extra (other than better video quality) from the VHS, overall its an exceptionally interesting look into the madman who wasn't mad. Highly Recommended for anyone who has ever wondered what makes watches melt.",1017014400,6,406,4.898550724637682
7893415,5,6305701288,"This excellent, 75 min. docu on Dali is a must for any hardcore Dali fan. There are lots of shots of his paintings & also interview segments with him & a segment on his brilliantly surreal film, Un Chien Andalou &  2 commercials he made for Alka Seltzer and chocolates (!) when he was older  & even a black and white photo of him and Alice Cooper. And a  thankfully brief closing when he was horribly old and stricken with  Parkinson's disease. And tho the box says this docu is in black &  white, thank God that's not correct. Check it out!",950745600,36,541,4.264705882352941
