165898,3,0800111842,"3 NINJAS
HIGH NOON AT MEGA MOUNTAIN

I have been a fan of the 3 Ninjas films since I was young but never got around to watching the fourth film. I even remember watching WCW Halloween Havoc 1996 and seeing Hollywood Hogan coming out for his match with Macho Man Randy Savage [who should have won that match by the way] with a wig on. That wig was the same one used for the movie he was working on, that film was this one. He came out talking about the film and everything but we should move on. So even though I had seen the first three and was a wrestling fan and had just found out Hogan was in this film I never got around to it.

Well that all came to an end here recently when I stated showing this films to my little cuz. Like me she loved the first film and thought the next two were good so we moved onto this one. As it turns out maybe it was a good thing that I waited to see this. The reason being that maybe if I had seen this back in my younger more critical days I would have hated this flick and torn it to shreds. That says something of how I feel about it now sure but at the same time I also found some good in it as I am calmer now.

The film follows the same three characters [obviously new actors to keep with age] from the previous films along with a new friend they had just met who moved into the neighborhood. They all go to a local amusement park called Mega Mountain for Tum Tums birthday as he wants to meet Dave Dragon [Hulk Hogan]. Dave Dragon is the star of his favorite show and is making his final appearance for his now being cancelled show at Mega Mountain. Everything is going well and the show is going fine until a group of baddies break into the park led by an evil woman named Medusa [Loni Anderson].

So naturally I am sure you can guess what has to happen, the ninjas kick into high gear. Now I really didn't get into the actors that they hired as the ninjas here up until the action started. I have to admit that I liked the action here from these kids as I thought they did a pretty good job. Even Hogan was fun here but all he did was play himself really. The film was written by director Sean McNamara and Jeff Phillips and for a kids film I can see how this would be at least fun. For the older ones though this probably won't be on the viewing list.

In the end I didn't hate this film like I know I would have back in the day but it wasn't great either. Like the other films it would have been cool to have a commentary on this film for the DVD from the writers or Hogan or something. If you are or were a fan of the other films you might not enjoy this one all that much. With that said over all it is a decent kids flick that has its fun moments. It should be noted that Jim Varney is one of the lead villains here. He is without a doubt the best thing about the film in my opinion. In fact it is possible that he is what saved the flick for me.",1411430400,,2896,3.9351535836177476

165902,2,0800111842,"*I couldn't find my purchase of the DVD in my region on Amazon but the movie is the same on VHS.
The only reason I bought this DVD is because I'm such a fan of Varney's. I wouldn't have known about this movie much less get it if he wasn't in it. While lots of people rag on Hulk Hogan, he wasn't the worst actor. By far, the 'Most Wooden Performance' goes to Loni Anderson. If this is a family oriented movie, why in the world did they have her dress in that skanky leather outfit that was far too short? Terrible casting as far as Loni goes. She was supposed to be the evil Medusa but I didn't buy it. She just didn't have the quality of pulling off the 'bad guy' type of role. She was the 'master-mind' behind taking over an amusement park and threatening to destroy it if the owner didn't pony up the dough. She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. I got a little tired of Tum Tum's 'Ay-yahs' after a while. They were too high pitched and over done. I was actually rooting for Lothar to become successful in his mission because he was the only one of the bad guys with the brilliance to pull off the heist. The other goons barely had a double digit IQ put together. Jim easily outshone all the stars, as usual. He always gives his best to whatever role he played as you can see here. Jim and Victor were the two best actors in this movie. The man was a brilliant actor and a genius. If you're a fan of Varney's, then yes, get the movie just to watch him. Otherwise, don't bother.",1331683200,,1486,4.145328719723183
165903,5,0800111842,I abosulutely loved this movie. Grew uwatching the 3 Ninjas and I already had the first 3 movies just needed to complete the set. Item arrived very quickly.,1286755200,,156,4.607142857142857
165904,1,0800111842,"""3 Ninjas"", as a concept, is pretty stupid.  Three white kids are taught in the art of ninjitsu by their Japanese grandfather, whom none of their parents look remotely Asian (I guess one of them was adopted).  The kids use their impossible abilities to fight evil ninjas in broad daylight, while making cartoony sound-effects and awful one-liners.  And people complain about ""Naruto"" disregarding the art of the ninja?  Regardless, it's a stupid concept that's marketable, but there comes a time where a franchisable product can go too far after many sequels.  ""High Noon on Mega Mountain"" represent the franchise pushing the bar as low as it can get, a heinous amateur production far from intelligence and fun.  There's only two reasons to praise it: one, no fart jokes; two, I saw it for free (legally, of course).

I can't even fathom how dumb the story of ""High Noon on Mega Mountain"" really is: it's about kid ninjas trying to stop pirate ninjas that's hijacking a theme park.  This story makes ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" look like ""Die Hard"".  It's easy to blame the kids for all the movie's faults, especially since the actors are totally different from the original leads.  Plus the new kids are terrible, especially the kid who played Tum-Tum, what with his sickening smile, his dopey voice and how awkward he fights; it's bizarre how the bad guys are defeated by this kid.  But in my opinion, they're not the main fault of the movie so much as they're irritants.  It's the villains that made this movie truly disastrous.

It upsets me how these villains stoop so low just to make this movie kid-friendly, despite several contradictions.  Nevermind how bad it is that they're controlled by a dominatrix from ""WKRP"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-guy-who-voiced-a-slinky-dog/dp/B000EOOVMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the guy who voiced a slinky dog</a>, but their entire operation is messed up.  Why do they need ninjas for?  They're a terrorist group with guns, and there's no point in stealth once the hijacking is done, so I don't see the point in having shadow warriors waving their toy swords around.  Is it just so the kid ninjas can fight other ninjas for the movie's purpose?  It could've been acceptable to have regular baddies doing martial-arts; there's no real use of ninjitsu anyway, they're just roundhousing each other.  I don't understand their actions, such as apprehending Hulk Hogan.  Why are they so threatened over a TV actor?  Granted, Hulk Hogan did cause some trouble later on, but how would they know that?  And what's the point in relying on incompetent lackeys to fend off kid ninjas, especially since Loni knows they're incompetent?  Is the movie so desperate for laughs that it needs morons to get their butts kick in moronic ways for slapstick?  And what's the point in kidnapping that one character near the end of the movie if they're just gonna leave her behind, especially when they had a good opportunity to just escape unnoticed?  It's like the sole purpose of that kidnapping is so the good guys can follow them.

And then there are the moments in the film that are just devoid of logic. One scene had the bad guys shooting the cops and they weren't hurt; the cops were in the line of fire, they were up close, so how come they aren't riddled with bullets? Another scene was when Hulk Hogan tried to escape from the bad guys, and they were shooting him from atop of the roller coaster platforms. Of course, they missed, but here's the thing; when Hulk escaped by sliding down a wire, there were people below him; shouldn't the bullets that miss him end up hitting the civilians? There could've been a pile of bodies lying in their own blood if this wasn't a kid's film. And here's the most baffling part of the whole movie: the ninjas found a timebomb and they taped it to 3 gas canisters so they can blast it at the bad guy's ship; despite how small the canisters are and the limited amount of compressed air they have, they manage to rocket the canisters from the inside of the park to  the ship, which is probably several miles away from the beachline...within a 20-second timer.

Did I mention ""High Noon on Mega Mountain"" is directed by someone who also directed the ""Bratz"" movie?  If that doesn't warn people about its awfulness, I don't know what will.  I'm surprised this movie even had a theatrical release, this has all the qualities of a direct-to-video release.  It doesn't stand the test of time, because it didn't bother to grow up.",1281225600,2,4539,4.855844155844156
165915,5,0800111842,"First of all, to all these negative reviews. Have you seen this movie? It is without a doubt the greatest three ninjas movie if not the greatest movie ever created.  Me and my friends stayed up all night drinking soda and eating pizza and watched this movie like nine times. There were three of us, so subsequently we each had a role in the movie and acted out the whole movie. I had my uncle charlie play the role of hulk hogan. I don't understand why people hate it so much. The acting is great, Sam Douglas plays the socks off that F.B.I agent. Dwayne Carrington kills the role of the Jamaican computer programmer. The special effects were insane!!! Did you not see the people stuck upside down on that roller coaster?!?!  The fight scenes were so intense. It sounds difficult to show a 4 year old baby like Tum Tum beat up a grown man, never less a ninja. But Sean McNamara, the movies director completely nails it. I'm getting goose bumps just thinking about it.  Buy like nine copies of this movie, and give them as gifts.  You won't regret it. GO DAVE DRAGON!!",1238716800,,1067,4.428571428571429
165916,1,0800111842,"Believe the hype. This 4th installment is terrible. You know a movie is in trouble when the highlight of it is Jim Varney of Ernest fame.

Premise: A group of idiotic thugs lead by Medusa(Loni Anderson) and Lothar(Jim Varney) hold an amusement park filled with people hostage for a ransom of 50 million dollars from the owner of Mega Mountain. Colt, Rocky, Tum Tum and their newfound friend Jessica along with the help of Dave Dragon(Hulk Hogan) try to stop them.

Opinion: This is the worst installment to the 3 Ninjas series. I grew up on 3 Ninjas and when I saw this I sighed. The original kids are replaced with 3 annoying and ugly runts. The plot is so lame its laughable. Why would anybody hijack an amusement park when there is big money eleswhere? Jim Varney is surprisingly good as Lothar. Hulk Hogan is unsurprisingly terrible as Dave Dragon, the amusement park's stunt actor. Loni Anderson wins the ham of the year award hands down as Medusa. I mean, have you ever seen a cornier villian? At least the other 3 Ninja movies had credible villains. Medusa is a cheeseball and her henchmen are about as bright as Laurel & Hardy. And you people dissed Knuckle Up? At least Knuckle Up had its moments. High Noon At Mega Mountain had none. Unless you count it being unintentionally funny as a good thing. Stick with the first 3 movies of the 3 Ninjas series and pretend this one never existed.",1211414400,,1397,4.561752988047809
165917,5,0800111842,"If there's one thing I learned over the years, it's that marketing doesn't lie, and this trend continues with the SMASH HIT movie 3 NINJAS - HIGH NOON ON MEGA MOUNTAIN.  Just as the box says, THE KIDS WILL LOVE IT!  First off, just look at the cast!!  HULK HOGAN, LONI ANDERSON, and JIM VARNEY all one one screen together?  HOLY SMOKES!!!!  I'm surprised they were able to get one of these NINJAS on screen much less ALL THREE IN THE SAME ACTION PACKED MOVIE!!!11  SOMEONE CALL IMAX!!!!  However these NINJA masters were matched with a very talented director, Sean McNamara, who had recent successes with blockbusters like ""THE LEGEND OF GALGAMETH"".  He really put this ALL STAR CAST through the paces and produced a movie that represents one of the best movies in the genre of NINJA movies, not to mention the CROWN JEWEL of their illustrious careers.

LONI ANDERSON playing MEDUSA made for a wonderful villain.  Her continuing role as the NINJA master in hit series WKRP really translated well to the big screen, and I definitely would have been afraid to go to HIGH NOON ON MEGA MOUNTAIN if she had taken it over.  I wasn't sure if HULK HOGAN was going to be up to saving MEGA MOUNTAIN or not with such a formidable opponent, but you'll have to get the movie yourself to see how it turns out.

If you're looking for one of the best NINJA movies ever with BONE CRUSHING ACTION, GLITZY MEGA STARS and HILARIOUS HIJINKS along the way, this is a movie the whole family will love.  HEY MR AMAZON, WHY WON'T YOU LET ME GIVE THIS A 6/5 STARS???  As of this review there are only 4 in stock, so snatch this classic up WHILE YOU CAN!",1177372800,2,1627,4.434343434343434

165919,2,0800111842,"I bought this film for a dollar with the intention of sending it to a friend who needed some ""family"" entertainment. Being a connoisseur of bad movies, though, my curiosity got the best of me and I had to preview it just to see Jim Varney as the villain, Lothar Zogg, which I admit is a great name. It is a sad day when Jim Varney is the best dramatic actor in a movie, even a kid's movie. (I would say this movie would be appropriate for ages six an up; the only violence is incessant karate.) This will definitely teach me not to watch kid's movies I bought as gifts.

Again, I repeat, Varney is by far the highlight of the film, although Hulk Hogan (as ""Dave Dragon"") tries his best to hang in there. The undisputed low point is Loni Anderson in a black leather outfit as the evil ""Medusa."" Her performance is not frightening, though her evident cosmetic surgery made me scream out loud.

The plot is that three kids, Colt, Rocky, and Tum Tum (really) learn to be ninjas from their grandpa, who uses a variety of teaching methods, most of which seem to involve toilet plungers. They defend Mega Mountain from terrorists led by the ""Zogg and Medusa Moronic Criminals Corporation"" (apparently) via endless action sequences and contrivances that James Bond wouldn't allow out of his tool shed, furnished by brainy techno-nerd, Amanda. Eventually the tension is resolved by the least believable plot device (hint: it involves compressed gases, a bomb, and a boat) in recent memory.

Watch especially for the scene with Jim Varney brandishing a saber, and the model helicopter ransom money interception collision ploy. I had thought of titling this review ""Extortion on the Log Flume,"" but that really didn't convey the pain that this movie inflicts. In the end, though, I gave it two stars for a couple of reasons: first, the name Lothar Zogg really is a great villain name, and second, the movie is (after all) meant for kids, so I should give it some slack.

Although I revel in bad movies for their camp value, this one is probably good for young boys, and a chore worse than cleaning out the grease trap for just about everyone else.",1155427200,4,2136,4.613157894736842

I have evaluated the martial arts in this movie. They are using a technique called Kun Chi Do perfectly. It's hard to appreciate this movie unless you are a martial arts fanatic. Those kids probably know enough Kun Chi Do to punch a man in the chest and make his torso explode, and then paint a fence. If you asked Frans if he'd walk down a dark alley with these kids hiding somewhere, I would say you're a silly head and then watch Jeopardy!.
