8650758,4,B00JH0SN12,"I watched a library copy of this video. I was amazed at how compelling the information actually is. It is a lecture detailing the differences between a biblical worldview and humanistic worldview and how both worldviews relate to scientific research, discovery, and journalism in correlation to dinosaurs. It takes a bit to get used to the speaker's personality and use of comics and cartoon illustrations. It was filmed at a family conference so that must be for the kids. I appreciated how the speaker uses the bible to establish the basis for truth and uses it as a guide to understanding the research. Of course, it is not exhaustive ... There is much that could be said about the unreliability of carbon dating and other methods for dating fossils among a great many other topics. But, for what it is, it is good.",1459728000,,818,4.7272727272727275
