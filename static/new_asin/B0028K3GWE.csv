8356331,3,B0028K3GWE,"DVD Is a  copied DVDR, so for some reason it did not work in my nice Sony network Blu-ray player, but eventually got it to work in a older player. Footage is kinda grainy but the general over-view is it seems to be what I ordered.",1390953600,,230,4.0
8356332,2,B0028K3GWE,"[2nd UPDATE: Recived 2nd replacement copy, and like original shipment it will not play on PC or DVD player.  1st replacement was better in that it was readable on PC, but not DVD.]

Wasn't paying attention when I clicked BUY that this is *NOT* a standard DVD, but instead a DVD-R that they burn on demand.

I love the idea that something can be produced on demand, and therefore make available in a timely manor that which wouldn't otherwise be available.  That's great!

And at first glance, I wouldn't have even noticed that it wasn't a standard DVD... the disk and artwork all look good.  (OK, if you know what to look for, then looking at the play side of the disc you can see that it's been burned instead of manufactured.)

BUT THE DVD-R DID NOT PLAY(!!), so while I have nothing against the content (movie) aspect of this product, I'd have to say the Amazon ""manufactured on demand"" creation of the product has some bugs that need to be ironed out so they aren't shipping a disc that most can't play! [Second & 3rd copy's disc/jacket looks great, too - so they've got the visuals down nicely, just need to have it play like a normal DVD...!]

This may just be a quality control issue [second copy would at least play on PC], and I'm sure that Amazon will replace/refund [sent 3rd copy, then refunded when that didn't work]. However, be aware that a player that plays standard DVDs may not be able to play this format of DVD-R.",1339632000,2,1433,4.46360153256705
8356333,5,B0028K3GWE,This movie is very nice. Beside the beautifual locations (and the main actress) I love how it shows what women at these ages are after with the great sense of humor.,1251763200,,165,4.354838709677419
8356334,5,B0028K3GWE,"This is a wonderful docudrama indie film that explores friendships, relationships and youth in a way that most contemporary films today cannot capture properly.  Certainly, the stunning backdrop of the beaches of Thailand add to the mood of the film but the genius is in the truthful interaction of the characters and the resulting commentary.",1251331200,,343,5.236363636363636
