4708019,4,B005I40TKY,"This was a true suspense film at its best. A creepy story about a group of farm kids who will do anything to get a set of parents at all costs! It makes you think about not picking up hitchhikers, even if they are six years old! Excellent purchase!",1169078400,2,248,4.081632653061225
4708020,3,B005I40TKY,"John Savage (The Killing Kind) is Peter, the oldest brother of six children in a family of backwoods folk. Peter is looking for a replacement for his dead ""pa"". This involves luring in potential candidates, holding them against their will, and voting on whether to keep them or get rid of them! Stacy Keach (Slave Of The Cannibal God) is a photographer who happens to get caught up in this situation after giving one of the kids a ride home. Samantha Eggar (The Brood) is ""ma"", a woman who made the same mistake as Keach's character some years before! ATKS is a decent 70s TV movie w/ enough suspense and a few nice surprises. I was never a fan of Robbie Benson (his movies or his singing), but even he is tolerable in this one! Worth a peek...",1156550400,2,744,4.398550724637682
4708021,1,B005I40TKY,"The other reviewers got the base line story right, i.e. It is a movie about a group of kids who abduct Stacy Keech to be their father figure but they left out the sudden and abrupt nonsense ending, not to mention all of the awful acting done by these fine actors in their youth! This movie was not worth the $5.50 I paid for it and once I had it, it was impossible to unload on any one else (just to nice I guess). It was a made for T.V. Movie from the early to mid 70's that alone should tell you something. John Savage from Hair (Claude), Robbie Benson from the Waltons T.V. show (John Boy) and of course Stacy Keech are a few of the all star cast I remember in the film.",1101427200,,673,3.9925925925925925
4708022,5,B005I40TKY,"Excellent print and excellent film. Stacy Keach shines as does John Savage and Samantha Eggar. The supporting cast are also fine.
Beware of giving strangers a ride when you are driving along country roads!",1089072000,4,205,5.0588235294117645
4708023,4,B005I40TKY,"Jimmy Wheeler (Stacy Keach) is a writer who travels all over the country looking for a story.  In Tennessee, while driving on a backroad, he comes along a seven-year old boy walking with a sack of groceries.  He inquires to the boy where he lives.  Gilbert (Tim Parkinson) says that he lives on a dirt road about a mile.  Jimmy offers him a ride home.  Five miles goes by with the boy giving directions.  Each road becomes worse than the last.  Jimmy ends up in the backwoods and finally comes across the splendid house Gilbert lives in.  The rain is pouring and all that Jimmy can think of is getting back on the road.  Gilbert mentions that his big brother can help him find the road back and would invite him for dinner.  Reluctantly, and with the rain pouring heavy, Jimmy decides to accept the invitation.  Three dogs are at the entrance.  In the house are five children (Robby Benson, Arlene Farber, Patti Parkinson, Brent Campbell, John Connell) and the older brother, Peter (John Savage).  They seem to be alone.  Where are the parents?  This is not a horror or macabre movie.  This is just an interesting backwoods family drama.  Some suspense and twists.  Samantha Eggar plays ""Carol Ann"".  Robby Benson sings ""All The Kind Strangers"".",1063152000,9,1245,4.680555555555555

8474127,1,B005I40TKY,"This is a typical low budget TV movie from the 70's that has a few bigger name actors at the beginning of their careers. The movie looks like it was shot through gauze, due to poor film quality I suppose. Poorly directed with a bad script.",1436054400,,239,4.217391304347826

8474129,4,B005I40TKY,"Pretty good thriller for a TV movie.  This family of 6 kids abducts anyone who wanders off the main road and forces them to act as parents, since the kids no longer have theirs.  The latest ""couple "" must find a way to escape before the kids vote to get rid of them--permanently--if they don't work out.",1414454400,,303,4.298245614035087
8474130,4,B005I40TKY,"An older movie, but pretty well done.  I liked the story, and it had just enough intrigue to keep my interest.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.  *Spoiler Alert*  I was glad that the kids (with the exception of the oldest) were not 'the problem'.  And the story ended as good as such a story can.  It was a creepy premise that was executed well.  Some of the acting felt 'stiff', but that may have been to make things feel more controlled to make you unsure of the characters feelings and thoughts.",1405296000,,521,4.255102040816326

8474132,3,B005I40TKY,"I chose this movie because of a vague fragment of a memory left from my childhood and I wanted to see what it was about but, I ended up Not caring for this movie! a little weird and negative to me. but its not a bad movie...just not too interesting! typical ONE dimensional 70's movie!  Robbie Benson singing may be the best part of it.  I would reccommend it to anyone looking to check out 70's stuff for the hec of it.",1381276800,,420,4.109756097560975
