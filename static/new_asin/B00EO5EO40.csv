8607304,5,B00EO5EO40,One of my favorite movies. So emotionally resonant and relatable. Upon watching it for the first time  I promptly watched it 2 more times and told everyone I know to check it out. Unlike anything I've ever watched before. Fascinating to watch a stream of consciousness Narrative traditionally fit for the page adapted for the screen,1477958400,,332,4.928571428571429

8607307,1,B00EO5EO40,I wanted to love this movie so much but sadly I didn't. It was awful. This movie is scattered and in cohesive. I don't want thoughts narrated to me for an hour plus.  I was hoping to see a story not an op-ed narrative on relationships. I applaud this film director/actor for thinking outside the box but sadly he missed the mark.,1424390400,,329,4.306451612903226
8607308,4,B00EO5EO40,"About 20 minutes in, I thought, ""Well, this is interesting, but I'm not sure that I want to sit through another hour of it."" Yet, AN OVERSIMPLICATION of HER BEAUTY's subtle immersive qualities got the better of me, and I'm very glad that I did finish it. It's one of relatively few films that I'll probably watch again, start to finish, in the very near future.

AN OVERSIMPLICATION of HER BEAUTY begins as a mock-academic cause-effect examination of common everyday emotions. As Terence Nance humorously explains at the beginning, he adds the story of his in-and-out relationship with Namik Minter as a back-drop to give concrete detail and storyline to the original mini-film, ""How Would You Feel?,"" which I believe is included on the Special Features of this DVD, along with the 8-minute ""Exorcising Rejection."" {Both of the shorter films are well-worth watching on their own.} The mass of the film is narrated by Nance, but Minter also steps in with some valuable insights of her own.

This film reminds me a little of 2004's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-the-Bleep-Do-We-Know/dp/B00E6X5U02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What the Bleep Do We Know!?</a>, only it's more about psychology than physics. Like the earlier film, it also incorporates spiritual and metaphysical elements without any reaching or preaching. It alternates between everyday street scenes in NYC and animated dream and fantasy sequences which, along with being funny and entertaining, are simply brilliant in a number of places. I must stress, however, that AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION of HER BEAUTY stands very much on its own. There is an exquisite imagination at work here, and the microcosmic view it affords us of universal ideas and situations makes it unique. In the end, the film is not just ""all about"" any one of its many subjects: love, human emotions, the rigors of everyday life, etc.

There are a number of ways that AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION of HER BEAUTY could have been mucked up. It could have been overly artsy, but Nance's accessible, often self-effacing narration avoids that. He uses mostly everyday language--the quote I use as my title is an exception--and the more complex sentences help to enliven the points he makes. It could have been overly subjective, but the sober, good-natured distance that Nance and Minter keep while describing their own relationship makes it universally about human relations. It could have been just plain boring, but the frequent variations between reality and cartoons, excellent camera work, and unique style and nature of the entire film make it just plain mesmerizing. By necessity, it's rather plotless and fragmentary, and the latter qualities are sometimes a little TOO much so. Along with a few needless repetitions, the entire film just doesn't have an entirely complete feel to it, an aspect that many viewers will find quite dissatisfying. Nevertheless, I'm not sure how it could have been completed, and I can say with perfect sincerity that even its more amateurish qualities enhance the film's personality to a certain extent. Most importantly, its heavily analytical nature could have made it a real downer, but it's anything but that. I went away from this film feeling GOOD!

One way or another, AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION of HER BEAUTY deserves far more attention than it will likely receive.",1395360000,6,3373,5.310861423220974
