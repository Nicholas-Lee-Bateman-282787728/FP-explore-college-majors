8388498,3,B0034PJWGQ,"The DVD has three horror tales. I enjoyed ""Hack"" out of the three as it pays homage to slasher films...you know kids on an island getting hunted thing.

""Harm's Way"" is about a woman at a safe house that is not so safe. Fairly boring ""Lifetime"" style film until the end twist.

""Baby Blues""  is a woman killing her kids. Seems to be done well, for what it was. I found it on the boring side.

If the price was cheap enough (no more than $2.00) and I hadn't seen any of the films, it would be a fair purchase.",1417478400,2,508,4.05
