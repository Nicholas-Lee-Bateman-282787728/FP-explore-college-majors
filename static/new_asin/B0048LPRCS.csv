4286426,5,B0048LPRCS,"If there was ever a two minute opening credit sequence that could grab me by the balls, it's from Gaspar No's Enter the Void. I'm confident it will have that effect on most people. You can see it at traileraddict.com if you don't believe me. I've never seen anything quite like it.  It's a strange beginning when considering the way it contrasts with the rest of the film. This hyper-frenetic, psychedelic introduction is the star of a film running around two and a half hours, and you'll feel every minute of its run time.

No has made a career as provocateur.  His last few films involve a level of violence, sex and depravity (and a mixture of all three) that anyone could argue is excessive and exploitive.  The problem, however, is that No is so talented, it can't altogether be dismissed.  It reminds of Lars von Trier, and his latest film Antichrist.  Enter the Void doesn't represent a marked change in style for No.  All the base elements are there: sex, drugs, incest, abortion.  And it's completely warranted to feel you're owed an explanation as to why you should subject yourself to them.  I don't have an answer.  But I can say that there are such dazzling flashes of genius sprinkled in throughout the film, that wading through the rest of the bog will be worth it for some.  Even though you'll come out of the experience probably feeling dirty, and empty.

Enter the Void is losely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a canon of scripture for Buddhists.  It is an instructional manuel filled with directives for those between this life, and their next reincarnation-what they should prepare to experience, and how they should react.  Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) is an American, living in Tokyo.  Or at least a No-esque Tokyo full of drugs and bass-thumbing club music.  He begins to deal some drugs and doing a lot of heavy psychedelics; the film opens on him smoking a bowl of DMT.  Here, the screen evolves into rotation patterns, made up of bright colors, accompanied by resonant sounds.  It's very clearly an hommage to Stanley Kubrick's famous tunnel of colored light scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey.  When the film premiered at Cannes, it was seventeen minutes longer.  Seventeen extra minutes of these sorts of effects.

Shot from Oscar's point of view, we mainly get to see the back of his neck, only glancing at his face when he looks in a mirror.  He gets gunned down by Tokyo police in a seedy club bathroon.  As he's trying to dispose of his stash, he yells that he has gun to prevent them from entering his stall.  He dies.  At this point, Oscar's essence slowly seperates from his body, and the remainder of the film, still in Oscar's perspective, is seen from what is now nearly a third person, but wordless narrative.  He floats about the city, through walls, no longer constrained by the limits of a physical body, but unable to communicate with the world that surrounds him.

He weaves in andout of his friends' presences, and follows his sister, Linda, around (a ubiquitously nude Paz de la Heurta).  Linda, a stripper at a club named Sex Power Money) and Oscar share a bond much too close for comfort since a horrific, shared experience in their youth involving the death of their parents.  No subjects the audience to this experience over and over again on screen which results in a slightly jarred understanding of why Linda and Oscar's relationship is so distorted.  There are many scenes too unpleasant for any film.  Particularly, an extremely realistic and graphic abortion, and an explicit sex scene made up of impossible, and impossibly candid shots.

Enter the Void could easily be classified as experimental as there's not really much that happens on screen from a plot's perspective.  It's a lot of floating-in-the-sky camera work, with little onscreen substance.  On one hand, this leaves plenty of room for meditation on what death is, and how we can, or should relate to it.  And it's easy to take advantage of this opportunity.  On the other hand, two hours of mediation isn't always the desired product when heading to the movies.

No provides his shocks and provocations.  There's no shortage of them.  But every now and then, all of the wildly unrestrained facets of the film converge and the cacophony of it all gets quite.  Then there are, quite literally, revelatory moments that make Enter the Void exhaustively interesting, and completely unforgettable.",1287878400,3,4410,4.781746031746032

4286428,4,B0048LPRCS,"I went to a live interview of Gaspar Noe to see a special viewing of Into the Void. With extreme films such as Irreversible it is very useful to 'detect' the character of the director to see what their 'mission' is - or are they randomly filling culture with destructive, offensive film? (Fine: some people judge the art object itself, regardless of its origin, artists intention. I am not one of those.) At least so far, all of Noe's films represent nihilism (Seul Contre Tous, Irreversible, Into the Void)  - pointless and detached views where the essence of life is cruelty, godless, cold. It is useful to be aware of such views, but ultimately, it's facile. Most people don't walk through a constant Hell.

Watch Noe's short film in Destricted, about loveless sex, that goes on and on and on - it's creepy, claustrophobic, insular. It's also, interesting to compare the film to the other directors visions of sex (the video is an anthology). For instance Mathew Barney's film is a very good counterpoint, essentially, the theme is the same, singular sex, but it is manifested totally differently. Where Noe's vision is desperate, lost, can't help using the word . . . nihilistic. Barney's take on the same act is positive; still weird, but not weird in an alienating way.

So, seeing Noe in a live interview? Such a surprise. He's charismatic, cute, funny. Knowing Noe's work in film, he's difficult to fathom in a half hour. How do you link the two? This friendly guy and his stylish, nasty films. I have also seen Michael Haneke interviewed live, in a special screening of Funny Games uncensored. He comes across as much more of a 'full' being. He is caring, honest, responsible and has a philosophical approach to things. You can tell from his words and bearing that he takes film seriously, he has conviction, his work is a fully-considered response to add dialogue to make people think, offering a view which questions Hollywoods more entertainment-centric bias. I know where I am with Haneke. With Gaspar, given his extreme films, I do sort of wonder why he makes them. They don't fully justify themselves, when you consider the same message in all of his film. Yes, life can be pointless, but that isn't the same as saying life is pointless full stop.",1509148800,2,2262,4.76530612244898

4286454,4,B0048LPRCS,"Some spoilers ahead!

I had mixed feelings about the film. Much of it I found annoying - the frenetic strobe light opening, (beware all epileptics) did succeed in conveying a sense of the confusion one sometimes feels on certain hallucinogenics, but I found it painful. I guess the fact that it is supposed to be painful should mitigate this, but somehow it doesn't. The rest of the movie seemed like the vision of someone who thinks he knows what DMT feels like but who really doesn't. This surprises me as Noe claims to have tried the drug. According to him, the protagonist is shot while on a DMT trip, but DMT does not last that long, and doesn't produce such a confused and blurry profusion of images. Maybe a bad mushroom trip would? But then there would be more emotion. This is a cerebral film, but the point that it seems to be making isn't all that profound. Maybe I am being tendentious? But once again, the confusion and blurriness of the images, the periods when the screen went dark, was all just painful after a while. And tedious. There were times when I got bored, and that's the worst.

The characters were vaguely empty. I felt no emotional attachment to any of them. The acting was only decent. Nevertheless, it was original and in a world where there is so much tripe, I guess it is worth watching. But I can't say that I enjoyed it.",1466380800,,1354,4.477732793522267
4286455,3,B0048LPRCS,"This movie has strong points, although I find it somewhat tedious at parts.

4286459,5,B0048LPRCS,"The most honest, psychedelic experiences ever. The film, through my understanding, explains the complexities of love through the perspective of the brother's soul. This fly on the wall perspective reveals an unfortunate disconnection between brother and sister who've, for a short period of time, reconnect (in a physical sense), but as you'll see are together throughout their story in an emotional, spiritual way, which in a sense is quite beautiful and fulfilling in some strange way.
The film is almost an out of body experience, much is similar to what the main character goes through. It's visually pleasing and interesting to say the least. It's anything but ordinary.
After experiencing this film, and I do mean it was an experience, I couldn't help but tell someone about this film- it had impacted me that much.

4286461,2,B0048LPRCS,"I'm not giving this 1 star because it's possible Gaspar Noe is a genius filmmaker and I just don't get what he's doing. Possibly.  But I watched this movie because I'd heard it was based on the Bardo Thodol (Tibetan Book of the Dead). If that's true, it's very, very loosely based.  Mostly the dead guy floats around Tokyo observing people he knew, or he revisits parts of his life -- both seem like cynical strategies to pack the movie with sex and female nudity.  All of this is accompanied by lots of strobing colorful lights and strange camera angles, apparently to evoke an acid trip.  (Depending on how you interpret the movie, the whole thing could be a DMT trip, not an experience of death).

On the bright side, it's a great movie to watch if you're ADD -- you can get up and go wash the dishes or have a smoke and know that you won't really miss anything; come back and he's still going to be wandering around Tokyo in a maze of throbbing colored lights.",1454198400,,964,4.363128491620111

4286463,5,B0048LPRCS,"From my print review
The credits melt into a kaleidoscope of befuddling geometric shapes and spiraling colors.

We're watching the world from inside the head of our hero, Oscar (Nathaniel Brown).

Worse, his head, his senses, his thoughts are all twisted up on LSD.

Things get even more surreal when Oscar - a twentysomething American dreamer-turned-drug dealer who lives in Tokyo - is shot dead by the cops.

Oscar is now spirit. An ego without body floating above Tokyo.

His wanderings - photographed as a phantasmagoria of sounds, shapes, and hues - loosely follow the logic of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which Oscar had been reading. His greatest task, according to the book, is to survey his life story.

It wasn't a happy life: Oscar was orphaned at a young age and separated from his sister, Linda. Recently reunited, they eke out a living in Tokyo - he as a drug dealer, she as a stripper. Paz de la Huerta (Boardwalk Empire) turns in a brave turn as Linda, whose sex life is busy, yet empty of real joy.

Don't expect a linear story. No lays out Oscar's memories - brief, gorgeous film postcards - in interlocking mosaic patterns.

The pieces never cohere into a seamless, unified whole. Life remains open-ended - even after death.

In another of the Buddhist ideas woven into the film, Oscar's travels into people's lives reveal how hopelessly we can be trapped by desire and regret.

No can never be accused of making soothing art. His notorious thriller Irreversible features one of the most brutal rape scenes in film.

In Enter the Void, he wrenches viewers out of their comfort zone and into a visceral trip as unforgettable for its ideas as for its provocative imagery.",1447891200,4,1690,4.733788395904437

There are several moments throughout the film when you want to relax and really soak up the moment and harmony that's currently on the screen and then several times something really troubling happens out of no where, so by the end of the film you're really unable to relax and are always on edge waiting for something horrible to happen or flash through a character's mind's eye,

Which I imagine is to put us in the perspective of the damaged characters psyches.

I don't really view this movie as anything deviant, it's more realistic than anything. It is an up close portrait of the sexuality of several related and casually related people, but I feel like given the nature of the film this is pretty realistic.

Be careful with this film if you have epilepsy. There are a TON of intense flashing lights throughout the entire film.

This movie has a lot going for it. A great soundtrack, it's visually stunning, and it has a great concept. Be warned this movie will take you for a ride for better and for worse (this is sometimes filled with disturbing content). You experience the life, death, and journey toward reincarnation of the main character. You live, die, become a disembodied spirit (Bardo) and are reborn through his first person perspective. Some parts of these experiences may not be that good. This movie is an emotional rollercoaster. The main character is ammoral and you see how some of his life choices affect the ones he is close to. He is later reborn and who he is reborn as is pretty spectacular. In short, the viewer experiences one cycle of Samsara.

It's OK to tune out, as I did at times, because the film is atmospheric and lingering. Oscar's DMT experience is absolutely convincing, as is the nightlife.

As the film opens were introduced to what is by now some pretty familiar terriroty with the usual reality style camera in the first person sort of idea that is begining to get annoying. But that aside its done with some genuine style here that is hard to ignore. For example the camera becomes the main character to such an extent that even when he bats his eyes the camers flickers black for a fraction of a second each time. It lends to the depth of feeling like being within this persons skin. Once we realize this and are barely settled in, the subject we are part of begins using drugs, and as he gets high we see and hear everything he does. And I have to say its absolutely masterful to see this and hear it. Visuals and expression so impressive that its nearly as breathtaking and groundbreaking to experience as those miracles seen in Kubricks 2001 in 1968. It really is an amazing segment. Onward we go still within the first 30 minutes as the person we have become is killed. And we see his death from his perspective. And this too is absolutely stunning. powerful and intense. So much so that its miraculous movie making to say the least. But then things start to take a dive. Once his spirit leaves his body he takes a journey into the past and the present as he views moments from his life and the lives of his friends. The time line is in no particular order. But the film looses much of its beauty and mastery when it settles more into a typical flow of arial shots and endless repetitious scenes of sex, conversations that sort of leave the deep breathtaking artistry behind and flows back into a state of reality in an overall lackluster and boring remaining 2 hours about what someone experiences after death.

4286643,5,B0048LPRCS,"Nope, this film isn't for everyone... but think about the type if film that is ""for everyone"" and you find yourself watching ""Saving Private Ryan.""

The opening credits are loud, weird and in your face; The opening scene is a kid (Oscar) smoking DMT. So this film will probably interest psychonauts, or those who like interesting psychedelic looking films.

The story is about the relation between life, death, DMT, and the Tibetian Book of the Dead. After Oscar smokes the stuff, we hear one of his friends tell him that DMT exists in the brain, and is released at the time of death (which is true). So he's implying that death will be something like the groovy stuff he just smoked. Then he tells him about the Book of the Dead, which is sort of like a what-to-expect after you die book.

All this is convenient, because the kid gets killed that night, and does in fact go on a journey a whole lot like where he went after smoking the DMT earlier. He floats above himself, through the past, watches his sister... and uses his friend's advice from the Book of the Dead.

The film is long, but I was digging the psychedelic float through Tokyo's underground. There is very much a plot and a story here... but it hangs on listening carefully to what is said in the beginning-- especially by the French junkie guy.

4286645,2,B0048LPRCS,"Enter the Void (Gaspar Noe, 2009)

For the first hour of its ridiculous two-and-a-half-hour running time, Enter the Void is my favorite piece of Noe since Carne (with the understanding that I have not yet seen I Stand Alone); Noe handles the non-linear aspect of the story very well, keeping it coherent while using what I have cone to understand is a very difficult convention. I've seen a few movies that have attempted, and failed, the non-linear thing in recent weeks (e.g. Wingard's A Horrible Way to Die), so I appreciate it working here a great deal.

Then we get to the last hour and a half. I understand what Noe is trying to do, and for the most part I understand how he's trying to do it. But still, there are certain points where it just plain doesn't work.

Plot: a layabout-turned-drug-dealer, Oscar (Nathaniel Brown in his screen debut), is on his way to deliver some pills to a regular client, Victor (Bright Star's Olly Alexander), when he gets caught in a police raid at the Void nightclub in Tokyo, and is shot and killed. At the behest of a friend, he's been reading the Tibetan Book of the Dead, to which he tries to introduce his sister Linda (A Walk to Remember's Paz de la Huerta) in the opening sequence, and the remainder of the movie explores Oscar's spirit--soul, if you will--undertaking the afterlife journey as codified in said book. We see Oscar--the film is shot completely from his perspective, over the actor's shoulder when he is in frame, or from his POV otherwise--watching the lives of his acquaintances in the present day combined with a number of traumatic memories that allow us to see how Oscar and Linda get from France to Tokyo.

It's good stuff, and the potential of it is realized in the first 40% of the movie. After that, it gets bloated and unwieldy, with a great deal of repetition. I can understand that in the case of some of the more traumatic pieces (Oscar getting shot being an obvious one), but some of the repetition just seems senseless. Worse, at least from my perspective, is Noe's obsession with what I call ""blinkies"". The movie is chock full of strobe lights and other things that change color or brightness or what have you very rapidly. And I know this is a personal thing, and your mileage may (and probably will) vary, but I find that really, really annoying. There were a lot of portions of this movie where I had to close my eyes simply because I was so annoyed by the blinkies. Which leads to the movie's third, and worst, major weakness: Noe just can't stop himself from filming things simply for shock value. The entire last fifteen minutes of this movie, known as the ""love hotel"" sequence... well, you know that thirty-second shot towards the end of Requiem for a Dream that got it rated NC-17? Imagine that drawn out to endless, and ultimately boring, lengths, overlaid with stupid strobe lights, and you've got an idea of the contents of the love hotel sequence. How do you make this sort of thing (and let's call it what it is, porn) boring? You can take lessons in it from watching the last major sequence in Enter the Void.

I finally decided to sit down and watch the film at the insistence of a friend but had failed to actually look up anything about the film, this turned out to be a terrific decision as I had no idea what I was in for. I had never seen a Gaspar Noe film before (a mistake I quickly corrected after finishing Enter The Void) and although his other films give a glimpse into some of his artistic qualities none of them compare to the other worldly exuberance of Enter The Void. The film is shot entirely in a point of view fashion from the mind of Oscar, an American expatriate living in Tokyo who seems to fill his days by gulping down hallucinogens and staring at his sultry sister (Paz De La Huerta). However the film takes a hard left turn when Oscar is shot dead by Tokyo police while dealing drugs in a local bar (The Void) we see Oscar's spirit ascend from his body and the rest of the movie is filled with complex crane shots looking down at Oscar's friends and family as they deal witht he aftermath of his death while he relives times from his past both tragic and sentimental. I wish I had more to say about this film but truly, you have to see it for yourself. This movie is definitely not for everyone but if you want to see a truly powerful film, a brazen experiment in film art, a true cinematic masterpiece then you must ENTER THE VOID.",1358812800,2,1560,4.255892255892256

4286678,5,B0048LPRCS,"I don't think we have enough time and distance yet to realize how new and singular Enter The Void actually is. Singular here is a very important adjective. Gaspar Noe's vision may vaguely conjure up David Lynch; particularly the yarn within the yarn of Mulholland Drive and, in turn, Inland Empire. But this is a film that sets out on its own two feet, that ventures into a world of memory and posthumous viewership. It addresses death in a manner that would make Georges Bataille proud, which is to say that dying becomes a renewal of spirit as formative as a second arrival. But, as with Bataille, that doesn't automatically mean that all is right again. All is lost.

I part with many critics who say that Noe's cinema is always one of nihilism and strained edginess. I Stand Alone is, in my opinion, the least of his efforts. It coasts on a wanton desire to shock, and suffers for that reason. But Irreversible, especially known for a few graphic scenes (and we all know what they are already), merges this transgression with consequence. Many people forget that, in the rewind that is the movie, we wind up in a bedroom with a naked couple in love. It seems as though the city decided to bleed all over their plans. You don't need to take a graduate level film theory class to see the dissonance. It's an inwardly beautiful world for two lovers; it's a chaotic, inconsiderate turned malevolent one once you step outside.

Likewise with Tokyo and Enter The Void. Tokyo doesn't care, just as Los Angeles, New York, London, and Paris don't care. It is a canvas for loss and disappointment, especially when one is sent there already adrift. And Oscar and Linda have always been adrift. There is no city, no concrete or neon, that is going to replace what's gone. In the west we like to see travel or exotic locale as generic enlightenment on screen.  Don't come here for that. Our characters' places are quickly defined, and as soon as that happens we are carried into a numinous space. Tokyo becomes the metro of dreams, not some sightseeing tour to give us false revelations. And the rest of the film is one big dream or nightmare, twisting within itself and crawling back to pivotal moments.

This is now one of a handful of films that perceptively captures the subconscious or unconscious state. Film buffs can see its influences, most notably the pinks, oranges, and reds of Kenneth Anger's short works. And, yes, it evokes 2001 in its grand, albeit fractured scope. But it is also terribly sad and affecting, which is something I don't hear often enough from critics and reviewers. ""Trippy"" does not begin to do it justice, and is a term we probably should have retired in the sixties. It comes with more than that, with sibling separation, with love that flowers in death, with things that we can't get back. As with Irreversible, which this film surpasses by leaps and bounds, there is consequence here. The feeling of a void is palpable.

Directors do not owe us happy experiences. Noe doesn't give us one. I recall reading an article many years ago about something called ""the impossible loss,"" referring to the residue a nightmare leaves us with. That is contained herein. It transcends the violence, the graphic sex (what sex isn't?), and anything else that is distractingly tangible. Everyone's enfant terrible is not just provoking in these two plus hours, he's kicking open the floodgates for new and unexplored textures. This film is about the impossible loss, and it moves along the columns of a dying mind. Take time with it. Watch it more than once.",1351209600,29,3569,4.7131410256410255

4286680,2,B0048LPRCS,"I checked after watching the film, and Noe is not, in fact, an adolescent, having been born in 1963. But it seems like he has a teenie sensibility--the film's plot seems ripped from the pages of some young adult novel:

Brother and Sister have a close relationship and promise each other never to separate! (""Promise me you'll never leave!"") But a car crash kills their parents! Now orphans, they become separated after all! But wait: Brother arranges for Sister to meet him in Tokyo! Together again! He, a drug dealer, she a stripper-escort--they're really Living Life On The Edge! Until he's killed in a drug bust--oh no, they're separated! But luckily, he'd been reading the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and knows exactly how the afterlife works! He's reborn to his sister: Together!

And here's some of the not very snappy, or even convincing, young-adult style dialog:

Sister: ""I would already have committed suicide if I didn't have this sensation that Oscar is somewhere around me."" [As Oscar's soul is floating somewhere around her.] ""I wish he could come back to life.""

Pimp: ""Stop hurting yourself. I know it's hard to admit, but dead is dead.""

The acting is wholly in line with the dialog, which is to say, um, unpersuasive.

My sense is that other reviews have cut the film a lot of slack because it's clear its onus is supposed to be visual. And the neon photography is, in fact, interesting for the first half-hour or so, but it palls, since nothing new happens photographically after that, and there are still more than two hours to go. I helped it along by fastforwarding through those endlessly repetitive scenes of the spirit floating back and forth over the same Tokyo blocks at night (there is no day here), by which expedient I reduced the the film to around an hour in length.",1348444800,6,1798,4.728434504792332

4286697,1,B0048LPRCS,"There was a lot I had in mind, in terms of expectations, as to what this movie could offer in beauty and landmark expression. I believe Film as a medium is more or less a tool for the artist and all artists (actors, musicians, etc.) to create sincere art. What I found in ""Enter the Void"" was not what I expected and I was not pleased by this at all.

There are a ton of experimental films, films about drugs, films about Tibetan Buddhism, and films about death that are less cohesive and still give the viewer/audience something to walk away with. I feel as though in some ways, ""Enter the Void"" was an exploitation of the audience as dumb. Movies like ""The Tree of Life,"" ""Pi,"" ""Waking Life,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" even ""Fight Club,"" work with a non-linear or experimental form of media to create their overall ""point"" as a piece of art. What I found in ""Enter the Void"" was excessive use of genitalia, flashing lights, hovering cameras, and flat characters to create a ""point"" that entering the void just happens and can happen at any time. I won't spoil anything, but the excesses of sex at the end of the movie don't really provide except for in that semi-symbolic way that some scenes do in other movies.

Most of the scenes in this movie repeat to the point of nausea, and it's a wonder why anyone would sit through the same four scenes over and over and over again. There is a car crash which is repeatedly used as a crutch for the two ""main"" characters, which really doesn't add to their character as much as it does to the plot. Those two characters whose parents die end up becoming 1) a drug addict and 2) a stripper. The characters in this movie seem victimized by life and in a way, don't provide anything for the ""Void"" in terms of meaning.

What I'm trying to say is that there is a repetition in this movie that makes you feel stupid: gratuitous sex that's supposed to be artsy because the genitalia is glowing (I'd frankly rather watch an artistically made piece of pornography); glorified, short-term drug use that really doesn't do anything for drug use or the expansion of consciousness (movies like ""Trainspotting"" do a much better job, even if they don't intend to); finally, pseudo-philosophy as well as pseudo-spiritualism (I don't get the point if you're taking both reason and faith out of the film) that comes probably unintended from the lack of dialogue and blandness of the characters.

It is certainly worth testing the waters on, but I frankly don't like the film. If you're absolutely set on watching it, go ahead, but be prepared to understand where it is going. There isn't any wonder about the film. Everything is given away after the first hour. Then you are left vegetating in front of the screen. It seems to be one of those postmodern statements about the audience, how we're willing to watch anything as long as it is done differently.

Spoilers:

The death scene of Oscar is best watched in utter darkness and silence, and contemplating Oscar's dying mumbles as he attempts to make sense of what is happening is one of the more profound experiences I've ever had watching a film.  I have watched this about six times, and that scene never fails to leave a major impression on me.

4286718,3,B0048LPRCS,"Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental, and as such, cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film itself.

Bound to appeal to only a small subset of film buffs (though to them it should have an intense appeal), 'Enter the Void' is an exploration of the split seconds between life and death, and an experimental trip through method and technique of film-making.  Gaspar Noe, the director of 'Irreversible', is the real star here, as this is above all the vision of the helmsman rather than a vehicle for its actors.  In fact, several of the key players were first-time unprofessionals, although that made little difference if any toward the film's overall effectiveness.  To me, success or failure for this particular sort of film is better measured by how well it communicates its ideas rather than by more traditional yardsticks - but having said that, it's also important to note that a reliance on unusual camera-work, disjointed narrative, and uncommon acting styles is probably going to turn many viewers away from the film before they give the ideas a chance to resonate.

A orphaned young man and his sister, both Westerners, are struggling to get by in Tokyo as a drug dealer and a stripper, respectively.  In the early going of the film, the young man, Oscar, is set up for a sting by one of his buyers, and is shot by the police.  For the next two hours or so, directer Gaspar Noe envisions the moments prior to death, borrowing heavily on flashback, the effects of the drug DMT, and THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD.  Shot entirely from Oscar's point of view (the only time he appears on-screen is if he catches his reflection, or when he lifts out of his body after being shot), the camera zooms around the hyper-kinetic nightscape of Tokyo, as Oscar's spirit - or Oscar's imagination - zips back and forth between city streets and alleyways, between past and present, and - perhaps - between one state of existence and another.

Visually, this film is unlike any other I've seen, with its striking crane shots and laboriously complex style.  Although I thought it captivating for the first half, the effect wore off soon and lost its freshness.  Still, based only on the look of the film, I'd still recommend it to those who are intrigued by inventive camera work and idiosyncratic methods.  I'm positive they would walk away with several technical insights and a sincere appreciation for the effort that went into making it.

Yet that's too small a group of film enthusiasts to reach for; there must be more to a film than the way it looks, so we are back to story.  I feel as though I misinterpreted the film as I watched it - it was only after reading some of Mr. Noe's comments about his work, and discussing the movie with someone else that I feel I got the intent behind it all.  Without those insights, I feel as though most viewers would have the same first impression that I had - that this was really a rather simple tale about death and reincarnation.  Reading the director's comments put a different spin on the story, but, unfortunately, did not add any depth to it - instead it then became a roundabout story of death and nihilism.  I don't have any objection to either interpretation, but the unavoidable fact is that the film could have made either point in half the time.  Two hours and forty-one minutes of swooping around Tokyo from a bird's-eye vantage point becomes repetitive rather than unique at around the hour-and-a-half mark, and the entire process loses the edge that made it worthwhile in the first place.

Despite these flaws, there are certain film lovers to whom I would recommend the movie - especially those who are always looking for something out of the mainstream.  It may not satisfy completely, but there is no doubt that 'Enter the Void' is reaching for something other than safe and sound storytelling.  The story may not be as profound as the effort behind it intimates, and the length of the film may indicate self-indulgence from the director, but it is unique.  That alone is valuable in an industry that seldom challenges its audience.

One last trivial note: This film has the most fantastic title sequence I've ever seen.  It's almost as if it were designed to induce a sensual stimulation that replicates a drug high or an epileptic seizure.

In spite of the major experimentalism, Noe manages to develop a crystal clear narrative thread and the whole psychedelic soap-opera comes together neatly.

Everyone here who likes the film talk about its cinematography but I thought I was buying a film with a plot, a narrative, and not just an excuse to show off a bunch of silly camera tricks. Every shot lingers as if to say ""look at me. Don't I look cool?"" Nothing wrong with being artistic but in film art should augment and not replace the story.

This is a shame because I expected so much from Noe after Irreversible. The talent's definitely there in this film but it seems so conscious of itself, so narcissistic, and ultimately, so gaudy that it's actually a turn off. If you're looking for a visual narrative check out Koyaanisquatsi or Antonio Gaudi. Pass on this one.

And this is my 2nd review after seeing it again recently:

Some films are simply so far ahead of their time that they simply can't be completely appreciated on 1 viewing. I am going to say this without equivocating and with all humility: this film has replaced 2001: A Space Odyssey as my all time favorite trip-out film. That's right, I take back everything I said against this film in my former review. I guess after seeing Irreversible and being blown away by it, I was expecting something similarly shocking. This film is an entirely different animal than the previous films in that it's trippier and, in its own ugly perverse way, more beautiful than his previous films.

Basically, the film's an odyssey of reincarnation and the afterlife told through the eyes of the main character who's a drug dealer who happens to get caught at the wrong place (Tokyo) at the wrong time with dope, a psychedelic drug called DMT. This is one of those movies you have to see twice, once to be be introduced to it, and a second time after it's taken root in your subconscious. It is something about the whole experience of this film that sets it apart from other films, much the same as what separates 2001 from other sci fi films. There's a plot but it's buried in the experience, the beauty, the horror of the images in this film, unconscious, you can't see it but you know it's there, like air, all around you. This is definitely a love or hate film. Noe outdid himself. This film will be talked about for years to come. Like I said, it's not about the story as much as it's about what you see, hear, and feel on the screen. Incredible film! Not for the squeamish.",1318464000,3,2683,4.423076923076923

4286722,4,B0048LPRCS,"Gaspar Noe's intoxicating odyssey through the hollowness until reaching the antipodes of the otherness of being, a journey that multdimensional operates on several levels.

The primary memory in which the two brothers kept the heinous faithful memory of his parents died in that fatal accident.

Memory beyond the life: after Oscar (a drug dealer) is killed in a bathroom. He established a covenant with his blood sister, where I swear I will never leave her. Thus the spectral ghost wanders from the second half of the film, always taking care of his brother and visiting all the places he frequented in life.

Chemical memory; where once the doors of perception are overthrown by the influence of drugs.

Memory decay: a thunderous and insmone journey through the Tokyo night, drawing back curtains ls beyond the neon.

Fetal memory: The film ends a regression to the antipodes to culminate with the primal scream.

Where silence cryptic images than to words. It is not an easy film to watch. I can not give it five stars because I find it overly long and at times possessed of a kind of baroque visual exaggeration.

However it would be ignoble to ignore its overwhelming impact and inquisitor that shakes the whole range of moods of the viewer.

I must find a place to hide, a place for me to hide... Jim Morrison (The Soft Parade)",1316649600,,1335,4.773913043478261
4286723,4,B0048LPRCS,"Some ENTER THE VOID cover blurbs are true. ""Most mind-blowing""? Yes, definitely. ""Leaves you dazed, elated and absolutely awestruck""  Yes and no;  dazed, for sure. ""Elated""? Exactly the opposite. Awestruck means 'reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder'. Fear yes. Wonder involves 'admiration of something beautiful'; so, sort of. Direction and cinematography are unique and excellent; but the subject/theme repugnant.

ETV is dark, ghastly, horrific, sordid, vomited images of bloody screaming children, drug-destroyed lost souls and  twisted melting minds. And disturbingly more. All intended to shock and mess with your emotions along with your mind. Mission accomplished.

On the one hand VOID could be a great way to dissuade young people from blowing their minds and lives on today's amp'd-up designer drugs, which is a very good thing. On the other hand, it will invade their minds - and yours - with nightmare images of people at their worst (perverse, exploitative, neurotic/psychotic, lost , lazy, stupid) most viewers will struggle to erase. VOID is the most downer movie I've ever seen.

I've written many Amazon reviews. This one is the most difficult. I read other reviews to find common themes, but in all, most media reviews - from London, NYC, LA  - took different tacks; mostly un-judgmental relative to the perversities depicted (one straddled the fence with 'perversely inquisitive grace'); choosing to address the film's cinematic technique aspects.

All bashing aside, it's an original, extraordinary film. No movie will hit you as hard, teach you so much of life's dark side. Create such conflicting feelings too. It rattled me, as did an earlier film by director  Gaspar Noe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irreversible/dp/B0013O123Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irreversible</a>. Images thrill; some prurient, others stunning graphically. Horrors of exploitation, particularly of women, are exotically lit by neon facades of modern-day Tokyo, strobe'd dance clubs; very stylized cinematography, very dramatic. Some ultra exotic facades may've been CGI. There are sailing aerial views of gaudy Tokyo as good as I've ever seen; seemingly seen by the eyes of a departing soul.

So that's why, in spite of my great discomfort watching VOID, I give it four stars. All films for all people cover a wide spectrum. Sermonizing sucks just like censorship. Three stars for execution; two for content. Life's full of subjective contradictions, ugly beautiful women, ugly cool men society and fate made that way; which makes VOID true to life, yes?",1314057600,3,2609,5.63265306122449

This riveting third film from French filmmaker Gasper Noe is a must see.  If you like movies by David Cronenberg, you will probably like this film.  It is shot in a non-linear way (jumping back and forth between past, present, and future).  Also much of it is shot above the heads of the actors (because the main character's spirit is floating above them).  Or it might be shot behind the main character's head (in past flash-back scenes).

Make no mistake, this is a true Noe film, complete w/ violence (though nowhere near as much as in his other movies), disturbing / numbing sexual situations (in the LOVE HOTEL for instance, where sexual intercourse is like vulgar wallpaper), and perverse characters.

The main character mostly just had to be a good voice actor, but he wasn't. There is a little girl however who could win an Oscar for best actress in a flashback. I seriously had to worry about what the hell they did to her to get that performance out of her. .... Actually I still worry.

The visual colors, the way the characters are presented, the way the characters stories are told, and the very unique camera angles all make this movie a must see.

Much of the movie is shot from a point of view perspective with the lead character occasionally going into the body and the mind of other characters. In some cases this is a bit provocative, especially going into the minds of certain characters when they are doing private things with other characters. In some of these situations going into the mind of that person could be considered pretty controversial, considering what they were doing and to whom. I will leave it at that.

Many of the shots in this movie are presented from an overhead perspective. These shots appear to move or fly over the city as it follows various characters. How the filmmakers were able to do this is amazing as many of the shots go on for quite some time.

I am sad to say that I would almost rather watch the rip than my blu-ray copy. The blu-ray suffers from the frequent grain problem that has plagued a variety of blu-ray releases. There is definitely more detail in the picture, but since the majority of the film has a dark backdrop... a heavy layer of grain is almost constantly on screen. With a movie like this in particular, one in which the viewer is immersed in the experience of the character, it definitely pulls me out of the story and makes me realize that I'm watching a movie instead of living an experience. I don't regret buying the blu-ray for the sole fact that it is the full-length director's cut, but it is disheartening when the ""highest quality"" version of the film is hidden behind an annoying layer of grain.

4286767,4,B0048LPRCS,"Why people consider Gasper Noe this amazing director I've yet to figure out. But while I don't consider him great personally, I do believe that he's... different. Different can be good. And Enter the Void perfectly represents his different-ness. From the very beginning of Enter the Void you know you're entering a Gasper Noe creation, and for any who may have seen Irreversible, a small feeling of dread starts to manifest during the flashy, seizure inducing opening credits.

Luckily for Enter the Void, it takes a step in its own direction and seperates itself quickly from Irreversible and becomes its own film (that's not saying anything bad about Irreversible). It opens in Japan, in the apartment of our two main characters as they introduce the theme of the story: death and afterlife. Without revealing too much, the lead character Oscar ends up taking a psychodelic trip through the world in which he created for himself, both past, present, and future. We the audience get to the witness all the events that lead to where he now finds himself. It's an uncomfortable journey, but one well-worth watching as Oscar's story is both interesting and terribly heartbreaking.

Enter the Void explores a multitude of uncomfortable subjects, including hard drug use, incest (implied), and abortion, to name only a few. And as is Noe's want, you're forced to experience these subjects rather than just view them. It can be quite disturbing at times. Also of note is the strong sexual content throughout the film. All of that shouldn't be surprising for fans of Gasper Noe....

Where this movie goes wrong, however, is in its length. Gasper Noe tries way to hard sometimes, and the extended camera transitions and constant flashing lights actually creates a kind of distraction. These moments make the film seem so much longer than what it is (it's already two plus hours long). There are plenty of moments in the film where you can fast-forward is miss nothing beyond dizzying camera movement. This alone was enough to take a star away from this film.

Gasper Noe's Enter the Void is no Requiem for a Dream but it has the same effect. It's troubling, disturbing, and warns against the dangers of drug use. Also fans of Gasper Noe will be getting exactly what they expect, a drug-enduced piece of art. Obviously not recommended for the casual viewer, fans of cinema of all kinds will love this movie, at least for the first watch.",1297123200,4,2429,4.888349514563107
4286768,5,B0048LPRCS,"Gaspar No's Enter the Void is a stunning, one-of-a-kind work of art. I'm not going to describe the story; there is not much story anyway. What is here is a hallucinogenic phantasmagoria of bright colors and wondrous sights and sounds which will take you into the brain, through this life and the afterlife, through several levels of consciousness and... Tokyo. It is not a story so much as an experience. It's beautiful, sometimes repulsive (typical of No), deeply thought-provoking and intensely emotional. Enter the Void is about the love between a brother and sister. A tale which plays out over two (or perhaps even more) planes of existence. It's a visual poem devoted to the wonder of the human spirit: life, love, death, tragedy, dreams, memory, sadness, happiness. A meditation on death and the possibility of life after death; also the evolutionary cycle of human life. It can be seen as many things and interpreted in many ways. It's one of those films that is intended to provoke discussion. It can also simply be viewed superficially as one heck of a cinematic acid trip. Whatever meaning you choose to assign to it, if any, it is a staggering film that will not be soon forgetten. Even someone who despises it (and I have already talked to one) will have a hard time denying the creativity and innovation on display here.

I will make no claims that Enter the Void is perfect or flawless. Very few movies are and it makes no difference. Who ever said that something had to be flawless to be a work of art? Flaws might serve to make something more meaningful. My criticisms: It's too long. At 161 minutes, the second half of the film drags on a bit. Like all of Gaspar No's films it can be hard to watch. There's nothing here quite as bad as the rape scene in Irrversible, however there are moments that might make you squirm. Anyone who is epileptic should stay away from this or any Gaspar No film as he is fond of fast-cutting and bright strobe lights.

Oh, and he is fond of camera movement. My god, the camera movement. If ever there was a movie that deserved to be seen for camera movement alone, it is Enter the Void. This is one of the most extraordinarily photographed movies I have ever seen. From stunning POV work, to long steadicam shots to bird's-eye-view to Superman-esque flying-through-the-sky shots, Enter the Void has camera choreography that would make the jaws of Alfred Hitchcock and Brian De Palma drop.

Gaspar No is a fearless, visionary filmmaker. An artist who strives to bring his unadulterated vision to the screen no matter how un-commercial or hard to watch that vision may be. Despite having only made three feature films (""I Stand Alone"", ""Irrversible"" and ""Enter the Void""), No deserves, in my opinion, to be mentioned alongside the greatest artists of the past several decades. He directs furiously, as if his life depended on it. I imagine him directing as a conductor frantically leading a symphony orchestra in an earth-shattering performance of Beethoven's Ninth. I don't mean to compare Enter the Void to the Ninth Symphony (or do I?). I see the kind of passion and excitement in every frame of this film that is only produced by a truly talented artist in love with his craft. It should be seen, or rather experienced, by anyone who expects more out of film than just a way to pass the time. If you believe that cinema is capable of life-changing art which illuminates the experience of living a human life, then Enter the Void is an unmissable film.

4286771,4,B0048LPRCS,"It's not as bad as what the critics made out on the cinema release. The idiots who praised the latest Disney rubbish rolled their eyeballs at this and scoffed like intellectual nerds. More likely they were too lazy to actually read about Tibetan ideas and research DMT to come up with a proper review.

This film is experimentally unique and well worth watching, but you will need a massive television to appreciate the visuals and, more important, you need to have never watched internet porn to be appreciative of the in-your-face rude bits.

The only problem was that it was way too long. Gaspar No&eacute; definitely needed an editor for this one. Also, the unique drugs visual in this film was not exactly a DMT flash and neither was the Tibetan Book of the Dead stuff all that impressive. The DMT visual effects were amazing, but I got bored after a few minutes. From what I have read about DMT, the scene in this film couldn't touch the real DMT experience. (You can watch the scene on You Tube). I reckon the DMT graphics in the movie looked like a Microsoft screen saver. It just kept repeating the same fractal pattern again and again for ten minutes. Also if you read the Tibetan Book of the Dead, then the stuff in that is nothing like the stuff in here.

Anyway I'm asking for too much I suppose. The critics also scoffed at the mention of the Tibetan Book of the Dead in this film, by moaning that the philosophy dialogue was stupid and sooo to-the-camera retarded and all that.

4286772,2,B0048LPRCS,"I'd seen Gaspar Noe's previous film ""Irreversible"" and I found it intriguing, disturbing, innovative and more. As a result I had no reservations in viewing ""Enter the Void"" particularly given the positive user reviews. I liked it very little.

Here's the scoop. Brother and sister lose their parents in a car accident. The two are separated for much of their life through social services. When brother comes of age he moves to Tokyo and begins dealing drugs. He makes enough to get jet fare to bring his sister over. They are reunited which fulfills a childhood pact to never be apart. She becomes a stripper and enters into an ongoing sexual relationship with her boss. Brother has an affair with his friend's mother. Brother gets shot and killed by police at a night club. His spirit then floats around to see all the things that happen before, during and after his death.

This is an interesting movie but Noe couldn't pull it off. There is little or no editing here. It's a series of long, tracking shots, most of which are overhead. This gets tiring rather quickly. These shots are bathed in colors (mostly red) which also wares thin quickly. You just can't see much and can't get into the characters because of it. When the camera does come down to ground level it's not focused and things are still bathed in colors. I kept thinking I needed to get my eyes checked. Then there are the characters. He's a drug dealer with no seemingly redeemable qualities. She's a stripper screwing her thug boss. I didn't much care for either of them, so when he gets shot, I had a hard time feeling sorry for him.

There is no arc to the story or the characters. They don't change from beginning to end and nothing changes in the story either. Things happen, but they're merely a non-sequential series of incidents. There are flashbacks to their childhood which seemed to be nice up until their parents die. There are flash-forwards to various things that happen, and things various people do after his death, but that's it up until the very end when, as best I can tell, his spirit/soul enters the sperm that impregnates his sister. Not really very satisfying.

This clocks in at 161 minutes and by the end I was jumping out of my skin. It seemed as though it would never end. I like off beat films. I wanted to like this one going in, but it just wasn't happening. There are some very positive user reviews here so I know it will have it's legion of fans, but I won't be one of them.",1296086400,6,2477,4.534675615212528
4286773,5,B0048LPRCS,"Gaspar No's 'Enter the Void' dazzles, disturbs, terrifies, and, in its own perverse way, enlightens. Some have condemned it as glossy pornography--pretentious and boring. But I argue that such reactions are misguided, and that the film seeks to create silence and meditation (just before it throws an avalanche of shattered glass into your expectations). Regardless of one's emotional reaction, no one can deny the incredible technique and craft that went into this production. The cinematography is unforgettable, oscillating between moments of claustrophobic first-person (shot through the eyes of the protagonist) and dazzling, free-floating shots that hurdle across Tokyo through buildings and into walls and pipes and drains and bodies. The neon color-palette and strobing lights will blister your eyes (stay away from this film if you're epileptic).

This is not a film for everyone. It is sexually explicit (very little of the sex is staged, and very little is left up to the imagination), it is violent (a nightmarish car accident and a graphic scene of abortion are two of the highlights), and it is harrowing. Go watch a Hollywood Rom-Com if you like your movies digestible. But chances are, if you have a brave taste for cinema, or if you have heard about this film through the grapevine and your interest was piqued, then 'Enter the Void' is a must-see.",1295913600,3,1365,5.176470588235294
4286774,4,B0048LPRCS,"Gaspar No has created his most ambitious journey with the latest addition to his already stellar filmography. No's new film ""Enter The Void"" explores what happens when you die and attempts to bring the audience into the ""psychedelic"" and near/post death experience. While this is his most technologically impressive and aspiring film it is not his best. In fact, it is the worst of his catalog but that isn't to say it is bad, it's just not as incredible as his other films. No has stated this film was inspired by psychedelic experiences and the ""Tibetan Book of The Dead"" which discusses the death experience including re-birth. He even traveled to the Amazon to experience one of the most powerful psychedelics known, ""Ayahuasca"". No laughingly stated this was for ""professional research"".

Newcomer Nathanial Brown plays ""Oscar"", an American 20 something living in Tokyo trying to make ends meet by selling drugs. Him and his sister ""Linda"" played by a sultry Paz De la Huerta are orphans from a horrific car crash when they were children. Oscar has a slight obsession with breasts, psychedelic drugs, and inappropriate relationships; including one with his sister. The story is told in three parts, first showing Oscar's point of view as he takes DMT and deals drugs. Second, we are in the POV of Oscar's soul after being shot, re-living the events leading up to his demise. In this section, we learn that he has managed to move his sister out to Tokyo where she has becomes a stripper. We witness the car crash that took their parents and learn about his ""awkward"" relationship with Linda. Third, we see Oscar's soul traveling the city watching over his sister as he promised her that he will ""never leave her"". The ending is ambiguous, but most of his films are; though for the first time that I know of, he revealed in a few interviews big hints as to what really happens. So be careful if you are reading interviews prior to watching the film.

As with most of No's films, ETV attempts to alter the viewer's perception through the use of sound and visuals. ""I Stand Alone"" and ""Irreversible"" were both filmed in this way and both managed to completely engross me into the characters psyche. In ""Enter The Void"", No attempts this right off the bat in the opening credit sequence. He uses an industrial trance song from the England techno group ""LFO"". Partnered with pulsating lights and text, he essential brings the audience into a psychedelic ""trip"". Some will be immediately turned off by this beginning sequence as it is almost seizure inducing but those who stick it out are in for a treat. The soundtrack was an integral part as well. There was music, but mostly it was background noise and what I think was Binaural Tones. Binaural Tones or Beats are low frequency sounds meant to alter the brain waves in an effort to change perception. If there is any truth to this phenomenon, I think the audience experiences it first hand while watching.

Noe uses the same technique as he did in ""Irreversible"" having the camera float above and transition through solid objects. This was one of the few things I didn't like about the movie. I felt like I had seen it before and that he wasn't presenting anything new. The floating aside, he did managed to show me something I have never seen before. The POV technique. I couldn't believe what I was watching when Oscar was standing in the mirror washing his face. The camera blacked out perfectly in sync with when Oscar puts his hands over his eyes. It was fascinating to watch, in fact there are many camera shots in the film that left my jaw dropped.

The script was great but some of the performances were not. I was surprised by this since all of his previous films were incredibly acted. No stated in an interview that there was a lot of improvisation on set in regards to the script. I can't help but think maybe this had something to do with the poor acting. I suppose the improvisation helped the film seem more real, but it just felt forced. One standout for me was the actress who plays the younger version of Linda. Emily Alyn Lind sent chills down my spine with her portrayal of a child witnessing her parents horrific death.

Another surprising, but welcome change is that this movie wasn't very violent. Pretty much all of No's previous feature films scared the hell out of me. This trip was different, though he still featured graphic sex as he tends to do in all of his films. But this movie isn't about sex and violence. At it's heart it is about the unknown (death) and shows the collective experience of many people over many centuries (psychedelics). Early in the film Oscars friend ""Alex"", played by Cyril Roy, mentions that the chemical in with DMT and Ayahuasca is in the human body already. He says that when you die the DMT is released essentially giving you the ""hardest trip"" you can get. My theory is that Noe wanted to show the effect of taking DMT recreationally (Oscar's first person view of a DMT trip early in the film) and the effect of DMT naturally occurring at the moment of death. A brilliant concept that he pulled off flawlessly.

As with most of his films, this is not for everyone. You have to be able to appreciate the craft of movie making to really understand the technical accomplishment this film was. Some critics have said this is ""style over substance"", but I disagree. The film has its faults, yes, but it is enjoyable and captivating. I've never seen anything like it and honestly probably never will. Gaspar No is one of the best directors in the world today, I can't wait to see what he thinks up next.

4286775,3,B0048LPRCS,"As empty as its title would suggest, likely quite intentional, Enter the Void is indeed a void.  There is nothing here and my comments may come with some extra sharpness due to my tremendous feeling of disappointment.  You see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irreversible/dp/B00009W0U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irreversible</a>, director Gaspar Noe's second film, is one of my favorite movies ever made for all the reasons I've expressed before.  Sometimes a filmmaker is most generative during his breakthrough and can never equal that success, and other times a filmmaker might bounce back with something lesser but work enough that they can care to learn from their mistakes.  Noe's problems are that he doesn't work enough on feature films and also that his fans will welcome Enter the Void just for possessing Noe's dingy style and moments of legitimately shocking realistic shots.  So really, what is there to improve when Noe's goal is to make a polarizing film to begin with?  Aesthetically Noe is strong here but I expected that given his short films and music videos since Irreversible also possess that trademark style and appeal.  However, unlike Irreversible, and even his first film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Stand-Alone/dp/B00005K9O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Stand Alone</a>, Enter the Void lacks a truly coherent story, or even characters worth caring about.  It's not that there isn't a story somewhere within the shock scenes hooking in the audience Noe has developed, it's just that the story was not compelling enough to draw me in.  That may change for some viewers but I'm betting most will find Enter the Void tedious and gratuitous.

The film stars Nathanial Brown, from a first person point of view for the better part of the film, as an American named Oscar, a young man whose parents were killed in a brutal car crash with Oscar and his sister Linda in the backseat, watching and surviving.  Oscar lives in Tokyo and will soon be reunited with his sister.  Oscar deals drugs in Tokyo and Linda, after she settles in a little, quickly becomes involved in stripping.  The story is a solid vehicle for Noe's style but without revealing spoilers I will say that there is certainly room for a more robust interpretation of the story then I would be willing to provide.  So far the film has been extremely polarizing so I'm sure a more enthusiastic viewer can provide solid insights regarding Noe's greater intentions.

There is still potential for Noe to create better work but given the amount of time it took to find the concept and actually begin working on Enter the Void, I find this doubtful.  I've had the patience to sit through films that claim to be meditations or cinematic experiences etc., but of those kinds of films I've enjoyed they hooked me in with strong overtones.  Because Enter the Void didn't hook me in, its rampant use of sex and nudity seemed out of place and completely unnecessary.  Visually though Enter the Void is still stunning and provides us with a very different perspective on the Japanese capital.  It's an aesthetic achievement and I can always appreciate it when an artist maintains his own distinct style over time, especially when that artist is talented, innovative, and unconventional.  Of all the praise and hate this film is receiving I'm offering a neutral recommendation.",1294012800,6,3440,5.288602941176471

On the positive side I think the sound for the film is well done. The viewing audience sees from the perspective of the main character (as in ""On Being John Malkevich"", but not to be compared). Too bad the film is not worth sitting through.

The DMT animation sequence at the beginning of the film is nice (I suggest watching that and leaving promptly afterwards). I thought ""Now THIS is great...."" but unfortunately it went swiftly downhill after that. He should have kept on with DMT, but noooooo.....

The characters are completely flat, the movie is WAY too long. The viewing audience is made voyeur to the lives of these hopeless & flat characters w NOTHING going on. It's simply impossible to feel anything towards any one of the characters as they are all so unbelievable. My guess is it won't work as erotica/porn either as it is tortuously long, slow, boring. Maybe some people will get off on the sex (most of it's  at the end, guys) as the sex is free of any of the clumsy details of actual human relationships. just desperate, bored and clueless.

What makes ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a great movie, makes ""Enter the Void"" a bad one.
""Enter the Void"", tries to shock and titillate (emphasis on tit), without having to deal with any social context, history, or anything at all that we can relate to (outside of drug dealing, violence, prostitution and police). Now throw in the Tibetan Book of the Dead...?

This movie is truly like no other:  dark, violent, personal, ugly, heartbreaking.  Film, like a great piece of artwork, is not something that you can truly get a consensus on because it boils down to the taste of observer and your own interpretation.

This film will receive a lot of ""boo's"" for such darkness, but that is the point of the movie.  When you stare at a dark and gloomy painting in a museum do you hate the painting for its darkness?  No, you observe, reflect on how it makes you feel, appreciate it for what it is and move on.  You might wonder where is the light but it doesn't make the painting any less valuable.

If anything you at least have to watch the opening credits to this movie.  Astonishing in itself.  I like the time and creative effort Noe put into this because modern films for some reason don't bother with such anymore.

I recommend Enter the Void for taking a plot that could have made the most dreadful film in the history of movies and turning it into a genius visual effect like no other.  Outstanding art in all its dark glory.",1293840000,4,1111,4.339805825242719

The primordial notion behind it is rebirth, but rebirth not only in the actual reincarnated physical sense, as is ultimately consummated, but also rebirth in the sense of being reintegrated with the breast; the notion of incest is absolutely pulsating throughout the entire film, and the metamorphosis of characters experienced throughout the sexual encounters is brutally direct in this sense. It would seem that the dream-like state one is immersed in after death is what allows the maximal realization of this basic instinctive drive, since it would be a state in which all repression is lifted, and desire can be experienced in its purest, most raw form without the nay-saying psychic censor beeping like crazy. This is clearly too threatening for a conscious ""normal"" person to face up to in their everyday experience, thus dreams and reality are distorted to conform to our particular compromise formations, allowing us to live day-to-day without being overburdened by the anxiety of facing our sexual urges head-on.

In its analytic scope, the Oedipal ties are clearly laid out as unresolved; the little boy experiences the death of his parents with detachment, the death of the rival (his father) and of his love object (his mother) occurring simultaneously, a kind of reverse deus ex machina operating in a perverse way, the rival is killed but in a way that destroys the princess they were fighting over. The impotence he experiences (double meaning) carries its weight retroactively in the notion that his mother tells him that she loves Oscar and his father, but in ""very different ways"", the Lacanian notion of ""the name of the father"" rearing its ugly head, the mother loves something the son can never provide to her (the phallus), thus the sexualized love cannot be realized. But in a moment of utmost mirroring of the father figure, Oscar enters the body of the father and sees himself through his eyes, watching his mother contort during sex and seeing ""little Oscar"" at the door, watching his parents.

As the mother figure died, Oscar must appeal to the next best thing in line, the mother's daughter... And the pact to remain faithful to his sister creates a sublimated metaspace that permits the diluted enactment of his desire to be engulfed and reattached to the primordial breast, at least as a promise. Linda apparently shares in some kind of dynamic of her own, as she kisses her brother in a sensuous way, she herself living her own Elektra symbolism through Oscar. Anyway, as Oscar enters the head of Alex, the rule-free realm of the symbolic permits him to experience his fantasy of incest with his sister, turned mother (in a flash), turned sister... The morbid desire for fulfillment compels him to enter for a brief period into the aborted fetus his sister produced, even the split and murdered off component of his sister representing a possibly desired destiny. Truly the ""come inside me"" line almost in itself justifies choosing English as the primary language for this film, and the encapsulated space of his sister's uterus creates the holding environment for the engulfment to occur... attached at last; the most poignant moment is when the baby is still attached to his sister (or is it his mother?) by the umbilical cord and is brought to the nipple, which is the only element seen clearly (this was a very smart move, from all standpoints, as a baby's eyesight is 20/400 at birth). This moment brings to a close the consummation of Oscar's fantasy, and thus is reborn in a literal sense as well as through purposeful incestuous regression. The unity engendered and its inherent hope are fractured with the cutting of the cord, at which moment the baby immediately starts crying and is taken away, the promise of eternal bondage destroyed thus again, entering the void of an existence deprived of any enduring physical contact, regardless of how many times one reincarnates, even when one enacts their most basic forbidden wishes. On a more controversial note, perhaps Linda experienced the feeling of completeness in herself as well; her desire to possess the phallus of her brother/father becoming alive in a bizarre way. As a female entity she became whole by producing a phallus (satisfying the dispelled notion of ""[...]envy""), and with a mind-twisting denouement she not only possesses but produces the familial phallus she so longed for, finding peace at last.",1293753600,44,4426,5.010869565217392

4286790,3,B0048LPRCS,"First off, you've got to throw some props to the producers for having the stones to put together this utterly bizarre and, at times, mesmerizing depiction of consciousness after death.  Don't worry about spoilers, the agenda for the film is laid out for the audience early in the film, as one of the (many) seedy characters in this movie explains the Tibetan Book of the Dead to our anti-hero protagonist: first, you die; then, you relive pivotal moments of your life; and, finally, you choose your reincarnation.

The film is almost entirely a first-person perspective of this person's life - and afterlife.  Early on, while our ""hero"" is among the living, it appears as if we're watching through his video camera while he films a conversation with his fellow-orphan sister (played by the comely, and fully on-display, Paz de la Huerta).  Then, we realize that we were actually listening and watching from inside this guy's head (once he looks into a mirror) while he launched on a major hallucinogen (presumably D.M.T.) before leaving to close a drug deal with his American buddy at a bar called ""The Void"".  The layered, densely beautiful, special effects from this initial hallucinogenic sequence make you sit up, startled, and realize that this is not anything close to standard Hollywood fare.

It's at The Void where our hero's perspective (and ours) changes radically.  As the camera lifts from our hero's lifeless body (shot to death in a toilet by Tokyo cops), the perspective changes, so that - instead of seeing the world from his eyes, we see the world from ... behind the back of his head.  This annoying device leaves about 1/3 of each scene blocked off, with the guy's big head in the foreground, as he deals with the immediate events leading up to his demise.

After about a half-hour of straining to see around the back of our hero's fat head, we get heavy CGI and truly inspired cinematography as he drifts from one event of his life (from infancy to adulthood) to the next, eventually ending up at the insanely-lit ""Love Hotel"" where he finds the source for his reincarnation (and the viewer is poked in the eye by nothing less than a glans in cervical thrust mode).  This scene, like so many others, is totally gratuitous and sickeningly over-the-top.  Clearly, the director (a likely disciple of Ken Russell) abhors subtlety.

Like I said, you've got to throw some props at the producers for putting this insanity on film.  But why does our hero have to be a drug dealer?  He finally comes up with the money to bring his American sister to Tokyo and she ends up as a go-go dancer getting banged by Mario - the Japanese club owner.  Why so many seedy, drugged out, amoral characters?  Has anyone, including the screen writer, ever heard of the concept of comic relief?  There is no such relief in this relentless, pitiless exploration of this man's hellish life and the awful lives of those around him.  Drug abuse, close-up abortion, adultery, children orphaned by parents brutally killed in a car wreck, and relentless seedy sex do not a fun time at the movies make.

I suppose watching a nightmare is more arresting than, say, watching a standard dreamy dream.  Linklater tried it - with very mixed success - in the overly-talky ""Waking Life"" back in 2001.  This film about life-after-death is at least as original as Linklater's effort, but is not nearly as entertaining (which doesn't say much for this film).

Film-hounds will want to see ""Enter the Void"" for its groundbreaking CGI and amazing cinematography.  The soundtrack, all synthesizers and heavy bass, adds a sense of sublime foreboding to whole proceeding.  Taken together, it's all heady stuff, if you know what I mean.  ;)

Most audiences will be repelled by the assaultive, relentlessly grim imagery, unappealing characters, complete lack of a plot or antagonist, and overall lack of coherence.  Far be it for me to speculate on what this film might have accomplished by introducing the concept of a loving God (who is totally M.I.A. in this film).

No has made a career as provocateur.  His last few films involve a level of violence, sex and depravity (and a mixture of all three) that anyone could argue is excessive and exploitive.  The problem, however, is that No is so talented, it can't altogether be dismissed.  It reminds of Lars von Trier, and his latest film Antichrist.  Enter the Void doesn't represent a marked change in style for No.  All the base elements are there: sex, drugs, incest, abortion.  And it's completely warranted to feel you're owed an explanation as to why you should subject yourself to them.  I don't have an answer.  But I can say that there are such dazzling flashes of genius sprinkled in throughout the film, that wading through the rest of the bog will be worth it for some.  Even though you'll come out of the experience probably feeling dirty, and empty.

Enter the Void is losely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a canon of scripture for Buddhists.  It is an instructional manuel filled with directives for those between this life, and their next reincarnation-what they should prepare to experience, and how they should react.  Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) is an American, living in Tokyo.  Or at least a No-esque Tokyo full of drugs and bass-thumbing club music.  He begins to deal some drugs and doing a lot of heavy psychedelics; the film opens on him smoking a bowl of DMT.  Here, the screen evolves into rotation patterns, made up of bright colors, accompanied by resonant sounds.  It's very clearly an hommage to Stanley Kubrick's famous tunnel of colored light scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey.  When the film premiered at Cannes, it was seventeen minutes longer.  Seventeen extra minutes of these sorts of effects.

Shot from Oscar's point of view, we mainly get to see the back of his neck, only glancing at his face when he looks in a mirror.  He gets gunned down by Tokyo police in a seedy club bathroon.  As he's trying to dispose of his stash, he yells that he has gun to prevent them from entering his stall.  He dies.  At this point, Oscar's essence slowly seperates from his body, and the remainder of the film, still in Oscar's perspective, is seen from what is now nearly a third person, but wordless narrative.  He floats about the city, through walls, no longer constrained by the limits of a physical body, but unable to communicate with the world that surrounds him.

He weaves in andout of his friends' presences, and follows his sister, Linda, around (a ubiquitously nude Paz de la Heurta).  Linda, a stripper at a club named Sex Power Money) and Oscar share a bond much too close for comfort since a horrific, shared experience in their youth involving the death of their parents.  No subjects the audience to this experience over and over again on screen which results in a slightly jarred understanding of why Linda and Oscar's relationship is so distorted.  There are many scenes too unpleasant for any film.  Particularly, an extremely realistic and graphic abortion, and an explicit sex scene made up of impossible, and impossibly candid shots.

Enter the Void could easily be classified as experimental as there's not really much that happens on screen from a plot's perspective.  It's a lot of floating-in-the-sky camera work, with little onscreen substance.  On one hand, this leaves plenty of room for meditation on what death is, and how we can, or should relate to it.  And it's easy to take advantage of this opportunity.  On the other hand, two hours of mediation isn't always the desired product when heading to the movies.

No provides his shocks and provocations.  There's no shortage of them.  But every now and then, all of the wildly unrestrained facets of the film converge and the cacophony of it all gets quite.  Then there are, quite literally, revelatory moments that make Enter the Void exhaustively interesting, and completely unforgettable.",1287878400,122,4394,4.768211920529802
8418715,1,B0048LPRCS,"lot of flash no substance, literary a lot of random flashing an it thinks it profound it not... the concept of the story interesting, a broken man leading a bad life end up getting killed, then goes on a journey into the next life.

the slow drawn out multiple random flash got old quick and bothered my eyes not because i have sensitive eyes just way to much 10-30 seconds of flashes over and over.  the random story mix in after the flashing make it seem like their depth but their not unless your easily impressed.  their lot of random T&A also which was mildly interesting if you want bit of soft core porn but overall it was a bore for me. i watched it because it was rated as a mind bender movie worth watching i felt it a waste of time so much so that i'll save you the trouble the 5 mins you wasted reading my random opinion was better spent then the 2hrs on this crap.",1527897600,,877,4.147058823529412
8418716,5,B0048LPRCS,"First of all, I agree with everything written on the sleeve.  It is truly a mindblowing, awestriking, artistic experience.  The directors cut is the version that i experienced and, at two hours and forty one minutes, it will definitely require a bit of your time but it will be well worth it if you are not a ""simple"" movie goer.  You will definitely need to keep the remote close in order to rewind so you can attempt to interpret what you thought you just saw.  It is not rated and if it were then NC-17 would be the appropriate rating, at least.  Definitely is or would be a unique movie-going experience and you will not need any mind altering substances to experience or enjoy as it is hypnotic in its own right.  Enjooooooy, hahahahahahaaaa",1527465600,,746,4.529850746268656
8418717,2,B0048LPRCS,"Meh.  Overproduced stoner film.

If you enjoy drug culture, transcendental themes, the movies The Arc, Biutiful, or Requiem for a dream, you would love this.

Me, I had a hard time finishing it.  Whole extended scenes are out of focus.  Everyone mumbles.  Losers just stumble through life.  Is  like watching reality TV from the perspective of a dust mite on acid.",1525478400,,364,4.852459016393443
