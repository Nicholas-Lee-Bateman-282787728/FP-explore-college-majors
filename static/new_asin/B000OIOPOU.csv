8185294,4,B000OIOPOU,"Status of Waiting for Happiness as ""art"" object:
This film mobilizes two competing aesthetic strategies: art film & realist. In the early portions of the film Sissako uses art film montage and experimental music to evoke a sense of place and in this section people are mere objects in a lushly photographed art film landscape. But about halfway though as ""characters"" begin to emerge from the art film aesthetics he transitions to a more realist style that features long takes and only music that the characters can themselves hear-- music being played by live musicians or that is heard on radio or tv. I suspect the intention is to allow the contemporary viewer/World Cinema aficianado entree into this world via art film aesthetics and then slowly disarm the viewer (of his/her art film armature and concomitant aesthetic distance from this world)......and allow him/her to settle into the reality of this place and these people via a more realistic style. But the effect is disorienting. And adding to this disorientation is the knowledge that Sissako rarely scripts his films and that he often uses non-actors. So the two competing aesthetic strategies and this knowedge that Sissako likes to blur the dictinction between fabricated and real also makes the viewer question whether what they are seeing is an art work or a documentary or some hybrid of the two.

Status of ""character"" in Waiting for Happiness:
In the course of this film we see middle-aged itinerant workers who are presented not as infividuals but as a group, we see a young boy and an old man (although we are never certain of their relationship), we see a student (repeatedly) and a group of women he visits (once), we see an electrician (briefly), we see a master musician and her young pupil (repeatedly). The itinerant workers are not characters, they are representatives of an ever-mobile (not upwardly mobile but latitudinally mobile) working class---whether they are actual workers or actors playing workers makes little difference. The young boy, we learn from research, just showed up on set each day and so Sissako wrote a part for him. In some scenes he appears to just be acting as himself but as the film progresses he plays a more and more important part--the central part---of this film. It is the most scripted part. It is the part that is asked to carry the most symbolic weight. When the boy arrives on set he is one of an anonymous crowd. Then he slowly endears himself to the director and slowly becomes a ""character"" that the director then turns into an allegorcal or metaphorical figure who carries the symbolic weight of the entire project. The musicians never speak. They just play. Whether they are musicians playing music or musicians playing musicians makes no difference. The old man who resists the new is also a ""character."" Whether he is speaking as himself or as an actor his lines, his age, his image are used by Sissako as counterpoints to serve a larger fictional story---the story of the boy whose story is also the story of this village (if we accept it as such). But the tensions that exist in this film between fictional and non-fictional representation of place and people draw attention to the fictional nature of any narrative it tries to tell, any narrative it tries to impose upon these fragmented people, this disjointed place.....the factual weight of some of these images (the musicians who are otherwise silent) destablize any symbolic weight it tries to make its fictional (the boy) images carry. The meanings of this film are in its characters and story but also in the way the film draws attention to its own representational and narrative strategies.",1384214400,,3675,4.917874396135265

How does someone from Sub-Saharan Africa or Mauritania make up his or her mind? What goodbyes take place? What do you leave behind? Abderrahmane Sissako, the filmmaker, features several characters (and generations) and uses the format of what some are now calling ""slow cinema"" to flesh out the ins and outs of ""departing.""",1366156800,2,424,4.985915492957746
8185296,2,B000OIOPOU,"<strong>Heremakono</strong> (Abderrahmane Sissako, 2002)

I really, really wanted to like this movie--there are a few things about it that really shine, but it never quite comes together; the stories Sissako is attempting to weave together never actually weave, leaving the viewer with far too many loose threads to gather at the end, with no loom on which to make them into a tapestry.

The main story concerns Abdallah (<em>Goodbye Gary</em>'s Mohamed Mahmoud), a French-educated seventeen-year-old who returns to his home village of Nouadhibou, on the Mauritanian coast, to visit his mother. (Note: there are two cities in Africa named Heremakono; neither of them is in Mauritania [one is in Mali, the other Guinea].) It's a tale of culture shock; Abdallah's modern ways, mode of dress, inability to speak the dialect of the town, etc. are all ridiculed, subtly or not, by the townsfolk. The main subplot concerns Maata (Maata Ould Mohamed Abeid), the town's electrician, and his sometime apprentice Khatra (Khatra Ould Abder Kader). (The main attempt to weave the film together come from Abdallah's encounters, and tentative friendship with, the much younger Khatra, but there's not enough of this in the film to make it the basis of... well, anything, really.)

It's the bits with Khatra and Maata where this movie is at its best; the finest sequence in the film comes about two-thirds of the way through, an almost dreamlike sequence where Maata, trailing a huge extension cord, wanders around the desert with a single illuminated light bulb. It's a sequence that wouldn't be out of place in an Apichatpong Weerasethakul movie, and like the rest of this film, it's beautifully shot. And the story being told there is a classic; Khatra begins the movie as something of a slacker; he's drawn to Abdallah mostly because Abdallah, thanks to the culture shock, mostly hangs around in his mother's hut not doing anything, but as the film progresses, Khatra finds himself needing to shoulder more of Maata's burdens, coming of age. That's good stuff indeed. If only it had been the main focus of the film. * ",1347321600,,2107,5.045977011494253
8185297,5,B000OIOPOU,"I believe that this movie is for everyone- beautiful cinematography and character development. I think that the film industry in Hollywood has relied on too many 'tricks' to make a weak storyline turn itself into an ok movie and this is the opposite. Watch this movie...

p.s. I live with 23 cats and they all liked this movie as well (just in case there are any cat ladies out there with a library card)",1279152000,2,404,4.45945945945946
8185298,4,B000OIOPOU,"Heremakono (Waiting for Happiness) 2002,  is a movie that to fully understand the ""poetic tone"" of the director, you may need to see it more than once.  It is clearly NOT for everyone, it moves slow, is in minimalist style and is more of one observing the culture rather than with plot and action.  The film is through the poetic eyes of the director, Abderrahmane Sissako.  Set in the Sahara desert that meets with the Atlantic ocean, the village is isolated, barren and with the wind howling through the desert.

Abdallah, a young man stops in his hometown village during his travels.  The village is young and old settled people, adobe huts, clothes of colorful flowing robes, music, dance and a still life.  And the visit to his homeland proves he isn't comfortable, can't speak the language, and he seems lost in his own homeland.  He is an observer to the customs, traditional dress and the language.  Unable to communicate, Abdallah learns from a young boy and is ridiculed by young women.  This is a film where the young and old are closely associated, passing down songs, knowledge, customs and wisdom.

In the DVD Features, director Sissako said that without language skills, a person's point of view becomes a mode of communication.  The point of view sharpens and he pays closer attention to the world around him.  Hence, that is what the viewer observes, a point of view.  You have to be able to grasp beneath the surface, to view the poetic language and follow the symbolic meaning.  For that matter, one may not even understand it.  But the viewer observes as much as the young man Abdallah. Don't try waiting for a plot to thicken or any revelations, you just observe the culture, the barriers, the meanings.

To understand this film even more, watch the special features, an interview with the director, and very important to the film, is the director's notes.

The film won the International Critics' Prize at Cannes in 2002, Grand Prize at Pan African Film Festival, and Best Prize at 2003 Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema.

8185299,5,B000OIOPOU,"While not for everyone (the antithesis of a hollywood film), ""Waiting For Happiness"" is pure cinema at its finest, and one of the best African movies I have ever seen.  Reminiscent of contemporary Iranian cinema,"" Sissako's poetic imagery resonates with a sense of place and describes the lives of those who inhabit it.  While there is an absence of plot and scripted dialogue, as well as no particular protagonist, the story is marked by the characterizations and tempo that reveal a real community.  Sandwiched between the ocean and the dessert, between ancient rituals and modern adaptations, fluctuating between hope and acceptance (life and death),  always with patience, dignity, and compassion, Sissako (director of the recent Bamako) doesn't try to explain, but gives us an experience to sink into, and provides enough information for us to make sense of; everything swept by the wind....",1185753600,11,896,5.244755244755245
