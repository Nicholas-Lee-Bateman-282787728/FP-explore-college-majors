8101757,5,B000CSH3JQ,"I first got this video when I was 28. I've bought thousands of dollars' worth of workout videos and equipment over the years. But, as I'm 45 now, I've always returned back to this essential video. It helped me burn off pregnancy pounds following the births of my 4 kids, and now gets me through fibromyalgia pain. No exercise beats this one as I've used it at my heaviest and weakest points through to the strongest, most fit times in my life. It truly fits all lifestyles and fitness levels. This is the only video, coupled with the Fit & Firm video, anyone will ever need to buy. It's definitely stood the test of time!",1472860800,3,621,4.408695652173913

8101759,5,B000CSH3JQ,"I absolutely love this cardio DVD. Mary Hart gives a very well rounded routine that works not just the cardio, but various parts of the body as well.  Her directions are very easy to follow. I only wish that someone out there would create this workout in DVD form.  I think it would sell a lot of copies.  Not many people use VCRs, and it is cumbersome and time consuming to fast forward to the section you want.  Please, Please, Please. Someone create this in DVD form. It my absolute favorite workout. And I will buy two copies--one as a backup.",1381881600,4,547,4.3861386138613865
