4331442,5,B004D45NXS,"Having seen When I Rise for the third time this evening, I was again totally drawn into the emotions and struggles of a sad time in the history of our nation.  When I Rise makes me feel guilty for the actions of a generation who lived before me.  Mat Hames, director, portrays the sequence of events over a span of 50+ years and shows us how attitudes can change with knowledge, acceptance, and empathy.  Barbara Smith Conrad is truly a talented and gracious lady with so much talent, and she is an example of how we can bury our troubles and move on if we believe in ourselves.",1297123200,3,578,4.333333333333333

8424774,5,B004D45NXS,"""When I Rise""!!!  What a deserving title; I enjoyed the history presented and victory accomplished.  It is simply amazing what some of the greatest singers had to go through to even get the slightest recognition.  Always had to leave the U.S. to be accepted and become famous then return home and be less accepted.  Such perserverance beyond belief!!",1331769600,3,350,4.982758620689655

8424777,5,B004D45NXS,"This Independent Lens production by director Mat Hames is as good as documentaries get.  It follows the full-circle 50-year arc of triumph by the Texan-born operatic mezzo-soprano, Barbara Smith Conrad.  It centers on two periods of her life: 1957, in which she is selected and then unceremoniously dumped as the romantic lead in a UT-Austin production of Dido and Aeneas; and present-day, in which Ms. Smith Conrad has ascended to the pinnacle of her profession and leads a life of international stature from her base in New York City.

Through it all, what resonates is the class and elegance of Ms. Smith Conrad.  The legislators and school administrators complicit in the 1957 events come across - without any type of framing by Hames - as weaselly and Neanderthal.  In recent years, both the school and the state have worked arduously to reverse the errors of half-a-century past, through official proclamation, awards and teaching partnerships.  One revelatory moment: Ms. Smith Conrad reading aloud from 1957 letters maintained by the university.  Though one she reads stands up for the decision, others reveal passionate, eloquent support for her.  Also notable is the steadfast support of the singer's friends during that period.  It says a lot that these are relationships that endure to this day.

The film is granted an even higher level of regalness through the presence of Harry Belafonte, who recalls the events of 1957 (and his role in it) with a crystal clarity despite his 80+ years.",1298160000,8,1501,5.065040650406504
8424778,5,B004D45NXS,"This film documents the triumph of character, hard work, talent, and perseverance over racism, bigotry, and smallness of spirit. Barbara Smith Conrad is simply beautiful - both outwardly and inwardly. The story of her determination to ""stay her course"", remain a student at The University of Texas despite the volatile environment, and conquer the world of opera is an inspiration for anyone who faces difficulty in any worthwhile endeavor, great or small. I wish every young person in America could see this story! The title, ""When I Rise"", is from the spiritual which begins ""In the morning, when I rise, give me Jesus."" After seeing this film the words of the song have been in my heart and on my mind all day. This is the story of true nobility. I cannot begin to say enough good things about . . . so I rest until ""in the morning when I rise...!""",1297296000,3,851,4.605263157894737
