You can't ask for more dedication than that from the ballerinas who participated in this epic DVD.  Their insights, experiences, the little things and the big ones - all completely fascinating.  I will watch this one again and again.  I enjoyed every one's story. They all brought something very special to this homage to Mr. B, but I found Melissa Hayden's the most enjoyable.  She was so articulate and funny.  MG!  What a great performer for such a late starter!  May she RIP.

Highly recommended!",1261699200,7,674,4.61864406779661
3513827,5,B001CK7OMO,"This is a great dvd about Balanchines talent & the woman who he touched. The interviews were superb & enlightning to this great man. I am perplexed as how when he picked a prima ballerina, he seemed to fall in love with their dancing & not so much the woman. He also took it very hard when they chose to move on. I think there is a lot more about this great man that needs to be explored. This is a must see for Balanchine lovers. Of course, the great woman are just as entertaing to watch & listen to. A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1251849600,5,604,4.87378640776699
3513828,5,B001CK7OMO,This is the second time I purchase this video. First time in vhs and now in dvd format.  Great documentary for dance students.,1247529600,2,126,4.478260869565218
3513829,5,B001CK7OMO,I saw this years ago on PBS and have it on an seriously worn out video cassette. I LOVED this program!,1244678400,2,102,3.9047619047619047
3513830,5,B001CK7OMO,"I am not a decadent spectator, watching ballet for show. Middle class describes my life and 'rough' my social skills. Yet I love the ballet as a means to escape the mundane, and celebrate the human physique. The dancers are athletes, only more graceful, careening on stage in an organized disarray. Displaying power and control, they hold back seeming chaos and defy gravity. But it is the choreographer that ultimately pulls their strings, and Mr. Balanchine (Mr. B) was among the best. This documentary covers his life with the New York City Ballet which he basically founded and nourished. In it six of their more famous female artists give brief experiences of their relationship to Mr. B, and this is intersperced with clips of excellent performances. This DVD is a great introduction into the spirit of ballet as well as a great resource of ballet artists. Highly recommended.",1241136000,23,882,4.966216216216216
3513831,5,B001CK7OMO,"If you love ballet, you probably already own this.  You most likely did what I did and bought on title alone.  If you are interested in knowing why the world of dance still holds Balanchine in such high esteem, this will give you a great prespective.  You will hear his dancers speak, and their stories are captivating.  After watching this film, I believe you will walk away with a respect for his influence on the arts.  If you seek out more information on Balanchine, I believe you will be amazed at his life.  I truly believe that a great movie could be made about George Balanchine.  He came from humble beginnings, came to America on his own as a young man, and changed the world of dance forever.  His personal life is just as interesting-marriages to famous dancers (one struck down by Polio at 27), and a long life dedicated to his work.  A complex man to be sure, and a legend that will never be replaced.",1232236800,31,915,4.431137724550898
3513832,5,B001CK7OMO,"I have watched this wonderful documentary over and over again. Six Ballanchine ballerinas are interviewed, spanning over 40 years of Ballanchine's career. What I got most from the interviews is how much these women loved and admired George Ballanchine. The six ballerinas interviewed were: Maria Tallchief, Mary Ellen Moylan, Melissa Hayden, Allegra Kent, Merrill Ashley and Darci Kistler. Footage of each woman's work are included, much of it very rare. You can see why these talented dancers were selected by Mr. B. Their stories are varied and intriguing, yet all have a profound love for Mr. B and cherish their experiences with the talented choreographer. They feel his influence even today, especially as teachers when they pass on their knowledge of Mr. B's choreography to a new generation of dancers. So interesting were these ballerinas that I bought biographies/autobiographies of each of them, except for Mary Ellen Moylan, where none were available. Suzanne Farrell was discussed; she was considered Balanchine's most favorite Muse and the one who broke his heart when she married Paul Mejia. It's too bad the producers of this documentary weren't able to get an interview from Suzanne. However, the six that were interviewed were very candid and honest. This is a a great documentary for balletomanes or anybody interested in Balanchine or in dance.",1429574400,4,1363,5.256880733944954

3513837,5,B001CK7OMO,"Nothing is better than hearing the assessment of those dancers that worked and were shaped by a great choreographer. It is sad that there are no interviews with those that knew Balanchine in Russia, France and Denmark. All of these places left an incredible mark on his work.
