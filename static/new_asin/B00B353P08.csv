5554432,5,B00B353P08,Loved this movie beyond words. Cybill Shepard a true lady of the industry and a great talent. But the biggest reason for purchase was David Burtka. He is a wonderful and amazingly talented man. He truly fit the role of Martin  and I look forward to what the entertainment industry has for him whether it is sceen large or small or even better Broadway.,1379203200,7,352,4.5

8561916,3,B00B353P08,"It is always refreshing to see an American movie in which violence is not the main theme.  In this the movie succeeds.  Also it treats gay relationships normally, as ""no big deal"".  Apart from Annie herself, there is a gay couple and a hetero couple, and each relationship has tensions.

But ultimately, it is not clear what lessons are to be learned from all this philosophizing and the recitations of Lorca's poems.

I saw Cybill Shepherd in Taxi Driver where Robert de Niro describes her as the most beautiful woman he has ever met.  Actually it is not just beauty but beauty combined with good nature and a sort of innocence, still not uncommon in American women.  Cybill as Annie is no longer the most beautiful woman in the world, and there is something refreshing about this.  We are all human, and time takes its toll on all of us.

Better to do the best with our lives while we still can, and better to help other people, something which is not a major theme in Annie's dreams.",1399766400,,986,4.49438202247191
8561917,2,B00B353P08,"Slow, heavy...Cybill Shepherd not her best. Dialogue stiff; not spontaneous. The food seemed most central to the plot and the angst.",1387670400,,132,5.333333333333333
8561918,1,B00B353P08,"I chose this movie because I like Cybill Shepard but this was a strange, sad story. No redeeming qualities to pull this movie out of the bottom of the heap.",1386979200,,156,4.233333333333333
8561919,1,B00B353P08,Slow moving with a weak plot.  This was a movie that took place inside 2 or 3 rooms--mostly conversational with no real action or excitment.,1386460800,2,140,4.6
