8528616,5,B008KBXB8O,"WWE has WrestleMania...TNA has Bound For Glory...NWA/WCW had Starrcade...and the biggest yearly event for ROH is Final Battle.  A couple of notes for this event as this was Ring Of Honor's first major PPV since being under the new ownership of Sinclair Broadcasting resulting in their syndicated weekly television show, the first PPV with the current ROH announce team Kevin Kelly & Nigel McGuniness (TNA's Desmond Wolfe), and also had both the biggest live gate gross & PPV buyrate in the history of the company.

T.J. Perkins vs. Michael Elgin - With Perkins nickname being ""technical lightning,"" he tried to use his speed to combat against Elgin's size & power but Elgin just kept catching him delivering punishment like ramming him into the guardrail.  Perkins went aerial with a running moonsault to the outside & kept trying the ""hit & run"" offense before again being caught in mid-air but later being able to pull off a reverse frankensteiner off Elgin's shoulders while Elgin showed his power with various powerbombs.  This was a classic story of ""David vs. Goliath"" but both men are athletic in their own right making this a good opening match.

Jimmy Rave vs. Tommaso Ciampa - A battle of a current Embassy LTD member in Ciampa vs. a former member of the group in Rave as they started off trading wristlocks & chops on the floor.  Ciampa was able to hit two loaded knees in the corner while Rave later attempted a baseball side only for Ciampa to catch him & throw into the guardrail.  While Rave was able to get some offense in, this was designed to not only extend Ciampa's undefeated streak but also further his gimmick of being the ""Dominate Male.""

Television Champion Jay Lethal vs. El Generico vs. Mike Bennett - This match marked the ROH debut of ex-WWE diva Maria as Mike Bennett's valet.  Bennett was the odd man out in this situation as he kept hitting the other two from behind & running before they finally worked together taking him out of the match temporary.  This triple threat started out as a one on one match between two of the participants while one would be on the outside but picked up on the second half with all of them interacting with each other with a heavy amount of kicks being thrown around including Lethal kicking Generico that ended up setting up another kick for Bennett right after followed by Generico going aerial back to back on each man.  It started off a bit slow but really picked up towards the end when with all three men interacted with each other.

No Disqualification Match w/Special Referee Jimmy Jacobs: Steve Corino vs. Kevin Steen - This match had a lot on the line as Corino had to face the monster he created in Kevin Steen, who would be reinstated to ROH if he won, while Jim Cornette was at ringside & the man responsible for helping Corino rid himself of his evil ways in Jacobs was the referee here.  Both men started off trading fist before started dishing out the punishment such as using a chair for a running chairshot & having the chair superkicked in the face, being thrown face first into guardrail & later being powerbombed on a chair sitting on top of the guardrails, trash cans & lids being used to the point where it caused bleeding.  Corino used more chairs used for impactful moves like a top rope splash onto Steen lying on top of chairs, superplex onto the guardrail setup on top of the chairs, and pushing Steen off the top onto the outside through a table with chairs setup on top.  Kevin Steen kept dishing out the punishment as much as he was taking it with an unprotected chairshot to Corino & package piledriver on a row of chairs while Jacobs also got involved in the action against Steen himself.  This was the violent brawl that you expected from the names involved but stay tuned afterwords as the carnage continued including one man getting involved who had a long history with Steen himself.

Gauntlet Match: Caprice Coleman & Cedric Alexander vs. The Bravados vs. Future Shock vs. Young Bucks vs. All Night Express - Some moments between the teams such as Coleman & Alexander having a short competitive encounter with Future Shock & Future Shock's Kyle O'Riley's performance against Young Bucks including a double dragonscrew legwhip & 9 rolling butterfly suplexes.  The main story of the match was the final two teams of the All Night Xpress & Young Bucks with Titus coming in with a bad leg the the Bucks singled out & focused on non-stop to the point where Titus was out of action for months afterwords.  As usual with gauntlet matches, the individual matches aren't usually long but this did have some nice moments.

Chris Hero vs. Roderick Strong - With Strong not competing for the ROH Title, he issued an open challenge in an attempt to show up the title match which was answered by former Tag Team Champion & member of Kings Of Wrestling tag team Chris Hero.  Hero was dominate here from the start to the point where Truth Martini had to cause a distraction for Roddy to get the advantage & kept attacking behind the referee's back.  From here the match went back & forth with both men bringing out the big moves like Strong's top rope backbreaker & Hero's roaring elbows.  It was a good competitive match between the two.

Tag Team Champions Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team vs. Briscoe Brothers - The NYC crowd turned on WGTT right from the minute their music hit despite that it was the Briscoes that started the issue between both teams with their chair attacks to the point where Shelton came into the match injured with a cracked rib.  WGTT attacked before the bell brawling on both the inside & outside of the bring using the title belts & chairs including many unprotected shots to the head to the point where Jay Briscoe was heavily bleeding allowing WGTT to dominate throughout the match.  The Briscoes caught a break when Shelton missed a move hurting his ribs which heavily effected him including where later he blocked Hass from an attack that only hurt himself more to the point where he was taken to the back only to later return with a wooden board being cracked over a head.  With the tensions between both teams being built up for 6 months, you got exactly what you expected here in that it was mostly a brawl with the chairshots being so hard hitting that it became very uncomfortable to watch.

ROH Champion Davey Richards vs. Eddie Edwards - The rematch from their previous ""Best In The World"" match between the two American Wolves partners with the twist that Richards had members of Team Ambition in his corner while Edwards had his special trainer for this match, Dan ""The Beast"" Severn, in his corner.  Both men worked a grounded offense in the early stages with Edwards trying various submissions like an anklelock or a combination of the hammerlock & sharpshooter while Richards did what looked like a bridging spinning toe hold.  The intensity started to pick up with Davey hitting two kicks on the apron to Edwards' face on the floor including one that looked like he knocked him out before both men went back into the ring with more submission attemps such as an anklelock & boston crab.  Edwards pulled out all the stops from a moonsault on the outside that had him land on Richards & the guardrail to a backpack chinbreaker to countering Richards offense with pin attempts & submissions of his own while Richards returned it such as countering an STF into an anklelock & a suplex that took both of them over the top to the floor.  They had many dueling moments weather is was headbutts, slaps or a battle of chops vs. kicks to the point where they beat each other into exhaustion which was clear at one moment when Richards was knocked out after a double arm back suplex attempt came up short towards the turnbuckles & had him land on his head.  Both men continued to fight weather it was Eddie with a top rope frankensteiner followed by two variations of a powerbomb to Richards' full nelson suplex from the top rope & again on the apron as it was to the point where one of them was even willing to take the win by countout.  This was the definition of the words ""wrestling clinic"" as it was one of those matches that as a viewer, you were just as exhausted watching the match as they were competing in it but stay tuned as you saw a preview of what was to come in the coming year for ROH & the World Title scene.

DVD extras include two matches from ROH TV in Davey Richards vs. Michael Elgin & El Generico defending the TV Title against Jay Lethal, footage of the backstage aftermath from the Steen/Corino match that resulted in someone being taken to the hospital, the unedited segment between Jim Cornette & Steve Corino & Kevin Steen setting up their match, the ""Briscoes Goes Hollywood"" and a ROH Video Wire.

I openly admit that I never watched ROH or a single match from the promotion until they got their recent TV deal with this being the first event of theirs I saw from start to finish & I can say they know how to leave an impression as this was one of those shows that had something for everyone from great professional wrestling (not ""sports entertainment"") to hardcore action.  If you were just like me & new to ROH in the past year or a long term fan, this is an event I would pick up.",1345593600,,9235,4.581917475728155
