5879864,3,B00DZ2ZOGA,"Great view if what money and revenge can do to a person, but not the greatest actors (but definitely not the worst)... but I did enjoy the view/concept of winning the lottery.",1391040000,,175,4.5
5879865,4,B00DZ2ZOGA,Good movie which I would recommend for anyone. Good lessons about how people should be treated. We enjoyed the movie.,1389398400,2,117,4.9
5879866,2,B00DZ2ZOGA,"I've seen better actors in high school performances.  The great message that the movie professed to have was understated or missed entirely at least by me.  Rather than focus on greed, the focus seemed to be on how stupid a lottery winner could be.  The good idea at the end about adoption was overshadowed by all of the unskilled acting and poor writing throughout the movie.",1389052800,3,376,4.666666666666667
5879867,2,B00DZ2ZOGA,the acting is horrible and the scenes do not blend well and there is nothing to hold my attention to continue watching it,1387324800,4,121,4.304347826086956

5879890,2,B00DZ2ZOGA,It was slow and how can a person buy a company that they hv no knowledge of how it works or how to use a computer. I couldn't tell if it was modern time or what.,1466985600,,161,3.5

5879897,5,B00DZ2ZOGA,A little slow at the beginning and the cinematics can be blah.  The story line is great...a kind of prodigal son that stayed home story.  Great for discussion of biblical principles.,1453507200,,182,4.838709677419355
5879898,3,B00DZ2ZOGA,"I like Isaac. He was genuine, a really great guy. He was proud of being a janitor and did his job well. He deserved the money. He was naive tho.",1453248000,,144,3.8333333333333335

5879913,1,B00DZ2ZOGA,Wow. This movie made hitting the lottery not that exciting. I kept waiting for the action to pick up once he hit the lottery but it never did except for maybe one 60 second scene. If you just have time some extra time to watch a really bad movie..... check this one out!,1445472000,,270,4.113207547169812

5879920,2,B00DZ2ZOGA,"I  became tired just watching the lead flip his hands through the air as a mannerism for speech.  He appeared to be a complete idiot, trading flying hands for verbal expression.  Such bad acting, I just had to turn this hot mess off.",1432771200,,233,4.372093023255814

5879924,3,B00DZ2ZOGA,alright,1426550400,,7,7.0
5879925,2,B00DZ2ZOGA,"Not very good. It's a story that's been told over and over again. One small redeeming quality is the lack of violence and sexually explicit content. Several gross out moment though, involving bodily discharges. Juvenile & not funny. More diversity needed for female characters, only one woman of African American heritage in a very minor role. Little thought went into the story line or scene setting. Examples- The 2 main characters volunteer time at what appears to be a mega church, yet they seem to be the only ones working there. The accountant makes a 'sudden realization' that the lead character is in financial trouble. An obviously bad rapper finds success. Save yourself the time & find a movie that actually makes a point and invokes some emotion besides disgust.",1425254400,,774,4.961538461538462
5879926,3,B00DZ2ZOGA,The picture may have been better if the quality of the watching been better -- lot of download interference and film is very choppy...,1424563200,,134,4.625
5879927,2,B00DZ2ZOGA,"am going to try and stick with it but it's gonna be hard.  it's about a janitor in an office building, right?  but he is going around to the offices picking up trash DURING THE DAY.  I can understand the filmmakers wanted to have interactions between the main character and the people who are working in the offices, but people who clean up office buildings work at night when there's no one around.  i want to watch the whole thing because of the positive reviews about the message, but it really bothers me when someone doesn't get people's JOBS right.  to me, it's saying that what a janitor does isn't important because the filmmaker thinks its okay to change it all around to fit the story.  will they please start teaching people in film school that having respect for people's real job -- any job -- is IMPORTANT!",1424563200,3,820,4.506756756756757
5879928,1,B00DZ2ZOGA,Low budget and horrible acting. Do not waste your time watching this movie,1424476800,,74,4.769230769230769
5879949,3,B00DZ2ZOGA,Good concept but didn't flow well.,1418428800,,34,4.833333333333333
5879950,4,B00DZ2ZOGA,"Let's not compare apples to oranges here. Great INDEPENDENT LOW-BUDGET film. I'd recommend it to anyone not expecting a $70 million blockbuster film.

Side note, if they ever make a documentary on the life of Jay-Z, Ricky B. (the main character) is a shoe in! I couldn't be the only person who kept saying, ""Man, that dude look JUST LIKE JAY-Z!!"" throughout the whole movie!",1417824000,,374,4.753846153846154
5879951,4,B00DZ2ZOGA,"While the acting was not of the highest order, the moral of the story was certainly sending a powerful message.
From that perspective, it is worth watching and aligning one's life where patterns match.",1416355200,,201,4.9411764705882355
5879952,4,B00DZ2ZOGA,"loved it, it was funny but a few of the actors need a few more lessons.",1415145600,,71,3.5

5879969,4,B00DZ2ZOGA,I thought it was a very nice movie. A nice break from all the unnecessary sex and violence we are fed daily. I recommend it if you like movies that encourage doing the right thing.,1404604800,,180,4.171428571428572
5879970,2,B00DZ2ZOGA,"The film was a good independent effort, but it took me 2 months to watch the entire thing because the acting was so bad.  I really tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but eventually got through it to the end. Definitely one for the Razzies!",1401753600,,247,4.145833333333333

5879974,3,B00DZ2ZOGA,"Low budget, not-great acting, a few bloopers, and somewhat predicatble, but contained  a message that was invaluable; ""don't  let money change you, unless it's for the better"".",1397952000,,176,5.481481481481482
5879975,5,B00DZ2ZOGA,This movie was great. It shows that money doesn't have to change you. You should watch it and learn something,1395792000,,109,4.5
5879976,1,B00DZ2ZOGA,"Not the best acting. After winning the lottery, he hooks up with a white girl from his past and they had no history other then being junior high classmates. After they're living together, then he calls his friend? I stopped watching after that. I couldn't take any more.",1395273600,,270,4.645833333333333
5879977,5,B00DZ2ZOGA,A great movie to make sure we are all checking the mirrow on our own actions! To make sure we are walking the Christian walk.,1391990400,,125,4.04
5879978,2,B00DZ2ZOGA,It wasn't an awful movie but it was far from good or even ok. I'm very glad it was a free movie,1391126400,,95,3.3636363636363638

8599372,5,B00DZ2ZOGA,"I enjoyed watching the movie I was rooting for Isaac the entire time, The story line has been done before but Great Gain show the difference between intentions vs a good deeds the entire movie I kept fixating on the fact the actors favored  Jay Z  and his best friend resemble Omar Gooding I know that had nothing to do with the movie it self but I just had to say lol either way as I always say if your like independent films and can overlook the budget it won't hurt to watch this movie.",1479686400,,489,4.136842105263158
