5889976,2,B00E4AG42A,Weak story that really goes no where and has very little if anything to say. One of those films that gets made as a favor to someone.,1382140800,3,133,3.962962962962963
5889977,3,B00E4AG42A,"""Let the sin begin."" Lamb Mannerheim (Hough) is a young woman who is very religious and has everything going for her. After a plane crash leaves her scarred on 75% of her body she begins to question everything. One day she can't take it anymore and refutes the existence of God in front of her church. She then sets off to find her own way and have her own experiences and what better place to do that then Las Vegas where she meets an angry lounge singer and a friendly bartender (Brand). Before watching this one I did something I don't normally do, I watched the trailer for it. The trailer made me laugh and I was looking forward to it even though I'm not a Russell Brand fan. This movie is an example of why I don't watch trailers. While I did like the movie and I am glad I watched it, it wasn't really what I would call a laugh-out-loud comedy. This is from the writer of Juno and the comedy is more that style. This is almost a bi-polar movie. One minute you are laughing and smiling the next you are crying and depressed. This is good but be prepared for that. Overall, a good movie that is worth watching but be prepared for the roller coaster. I give it a B.",1382054400,5,1169,4.2
5889978,4,B00E4AG42A,"If you are only going into this expecting it to be another Juno, then readjust your thinking.  This is a sad, sweet, poignant, personal, and pinpoint funny film.  It is quirky one moment then subtle the next.  Julianne is just effervescent enough, and I never found her over the top.  The entire supporting cast did their job wonderfully.  Russell was charming and Octavia was a lovable grump.  I enjoyed Cody's perspective as a screenwriter and as a director.  I really hope people give this a chance.",1381881600,2,502,4.767441860465116
5889979,2,B00E4AG42A,"I like Julianne Hough and Russell Brand but this movie is boring, I kept hoping it would get better but it just didn't. I was barely able to stick with it to the end. Had I not paid for it I would not have seen the entire movie. I think the deciding factor of me not liking the movie was when Julianne's character helped out the call girl she met in the bathroom. I feel like that just wouldn't be enough for a person who has lost their faith to turn back around.",1381708800,,463,3.989247311827957

5889982,3,B00E4AG42A,"The idea for this movie is pretty interesting.  A young, devoutly Christian woman who has never known life beyond her insulated community is severely burned in a plane crash.  Her injuries make her question her faith and everything about her life.  She decides to take the money she gets from a settlement with the airplane manufacturer and go to Sin City (Las Vegas) alone to experience life for the first time.  It's at this point that the plot gets overly simplified and saccharine.  She meets up with a kindly bartender and a motherly lounge singer who take her under their wing.  She has a list of things she wants to accomplish like drinking alcohol, dancing, getting a tattoo, etc.  They accompany her and in the process she realizes the wild life isn't all glamorous and exotic.  You can probably pretty much write the ending yourself.  Julianne Hough, Russell Brand, Holly Hunter and
Octavia Spencer are all good in their performances and they actually save the film from becoming too treacly to stomach.  It's definitely a feel good, bit of fluff, kind of movie so if that's what you're looking for this isn't bad.",1381104000,6,1124,4.77720207253886

5889993,4,B00E4AG42A,"I really liked Paradise! It was clearly a B movie with a few A actors thrown in, but I loved the quirky story. Julianne Hough has surprised me with her acting and singing in this movie and Rock of Ages. Both have similar story lines with a small town girl trying to find herself in two totally different venues. Being filmed in Vegas because it was the 'SIN CITY' was fun especially since it was filmed on Fremont Street. If you can by pass the unrealistic aspects of this happening, small town, innocent girl ending up with Russell Brand for a night, then you just may like this movie. I myself understand the whole Church side of this story and that could be one of the reasons I liked the movie, because I got it. You could definitely watch with your teen and not fast forward!!

5890004,1,B00E4AG42A,"I thought this might be a fun movie to watch about Los Vegas, but it was the most boring piece of junk that I've seen in a long time. It starts with the star being horribly scared from an accident in which she was burned and then telling her church that she dosn't believe in God then taking off to Los Vegas to fullfill her list of sins. She is befriended by the bartender and a African American singer and begins to explore the seedier low class side of Vegas. I kept waiting for it to get better, but that never happened. A total waste of time and money.",1395705600,,557,4.1192660550458715
5890005,5,B00E4AG42A,"Paradise starring Julianne Hough really caught me by surprise. I wasn't expecting to like this coming-of-age drama as much as I did. I've never been a fan of Hough's acting, but she completely blew me away in this film. Her performance as Lamb, a young women who gets burned physically after a plane crash who eventually loses her faith in God and sets out to Las Vegas to find herself (and commit a few minor sins). Great supporting performances by Octavia Spencer and Russell Brand. This film was written and directed by Diablo Cody, who also wrote Juno and Young Adult. Paradise is her most conservative piece of work. It's more organic and heartfelt but not fluffy or preachy. This film has some funny moments, but overall Paradise is a dramatic film about learning to overcome obstacles, and accepting that everyone has scars, not just on the outside. Give it a try. Enjoy!",1395360000,5,878,4.745098039215686
5890006,4,B00E4AG42A,The story line was plausible.  It was realistic about someone who'd lost their faith.  Liked that the characters weren't perfect.  Moved quickly so didn't get bored with a lot of extraneous back drop.,1394841600,3,200,5.0

5890013,4,B00E4AG42A,"another one that really impressed me. I've been a big fan of diablo cody since jennifer's body, so I was excited to hear about her movie paradise. then I read it was about a christian girl who is in a very bad accident that leaves her disfigured who turns her back on god, renounces christianity, and heads to las vegas to basically fulfill her sin bucket list. now, I'm a christian, but not a fanatical one, and I know a little about diablo, her background, and opions. so I was expecting a very cynical, anti-christian moviebut instead it was arather positive journey for this girl who finds herself in vegas and comes to peace with her place in lifeher purpose, I guess you could say. all the principle actors: julianne hough, russell brandt, and octavia spencer did an excellent job, and I ended up enjoying this film a lot more than expected. I'm also one of those that really enjoys videos with a good helping of extras, and while there aren't a whole lot on this one, I did like the commentary from diablothis being her first writing AND directing project, it was fun to hear her insights and comments in general about this story in the commentary. looks great on blu-ray, but would probably be fine on dvd (but I almost always prefer blu-ray.) check it out!",1390089600,3,1265,4.552631578947368
5890014,3,B00E4AG42A,"The story line is fairly good, with some LOL moments.  As much as I love Julianne Hough as a dancer and singer, she falls short in a few scenes as an actress.  Good supporting actors.",1389830400,,183,4.2

5890016,2,B00E4AG42A,"Not much to say about the film. My wife and I watched it because we wanted to see what acting chops she possessed. We've always enjoyed Julianne and Derek's dancing. From there I bought her country album to experience her singing talent (good but not great). Now that she has a few movies out, we wanted to see how this obviously talented woman fared in front of a camera. My biggest criticism of her acting is that she never seemed to be anything more than Julianne Hough. It was disappointing. The movie was pretty standard fare. Nothing to write home about.",1389398400,,560,4.554455445544554

5890021,3,B00E4AG42A,"Right away I found the main character to be a bit cliche despite the burns all over her body.  Small town church girls wouldn't normally just hop on a plane to Las Vegas all alone the day after getting a big cash settlement.  Once you get past that limitation, the two working class characters she meets are likable but inconsequential.  They simply fail to show her a very good time or even how to survive as a single person in the minefield of Vegas.  It also lacks a proper ending.  Nothing has changed.",1388361600,,506,4.397849462365591

Julianne and Russel really have chemistry and Octavia singing Radiohead?! Man she really nailed in a different way! I recommend this one if you are starting to really getting bored with the average flick. Julianne Hough has really pushed her ability this time.

5890026,1,B00E4AG42A,"Oh how the mighty have fallen.  Diablo Cody's first big movie, Juno, was interesting for its time.  But watch I watched it again recently, and I can't believe I was so into it's oh-so-witty and aren't I irreverent and observant aren't I so-so-clever and aware dialogue.  Unique for its time, to be sure.  And a great cast, especially Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman,  Now, with this film, I'm not sure if she has lost all sense of talent, if she has sold out, or if her style of writing, which was so irreverent at that time, now just seems so hum-drum.  Some good actors again (though Julianne Hough as a leading actor? really?--another example of what happened to Diablo Cody's Hollywood following that this is her film's ""star""?), this movie just made me sad, to see how far this one-time talent (Cody, not Hough) has fallen.

5890028,5,B00E4AG42A,"I watched this being a Diablo Cody fan. The only Russell Brand I've seen are his movies with Judd Apatow, which I would've like with or without Russel. Julianne Hough just hasn't done my kind of thing, I mean she sings country music, was on Dancing with the Stars, and has been in a few musicals. I didn't know what to expect with her.

It is a relatable story of getting to the age where you don't automatically believe what your parents tell you to believe anymore and you have to start figuring things out for yourself. Here, Lamb (Hough) is doing the whirlwind tour version of this. An accident has left her hurt and disfigured which has shaken her belief system and left her very angry at God and her conservative family and friends. She leaves a separatist fundamentalist evangelical community to check out life out in the world, opting for the most extremely different kind of place she can think of: Vegas. Her character is an adorkable kid and very poignant at the same time, like an 18-year-old Vada Sultenfuss from My Girl (although not nearly as awesome as Vada is). She's funny in a naive way but keeps mixing it up with sad moments and inner monologues that make her character unique.

The supporting cast include a couple of characters going through their own transitions. I'll say it's a bit of a stretch that kismet just happens to bring them all together, but if you can get past that part you'll find the rest of the plot is more believable. Not spoiling anything, the main character manages to get on the road to finding herself.

This movie isn't so funny you'll laugh a lot or so dramatic you'll cry, but it's never boring, either. The story works particularly well for those of us who were a little too sheltered as kids and remember what it was like coming into our own. If you aren't someone like us, read this review as 3 or 4 starts.

The characters of Loray and William carefully help Lamb navigate through various places in Las Vegas through their own free will.

All of her beliefs have come into question and she begins to wonder what she has missed out by having been raised in such a restrictive and protective environment.
