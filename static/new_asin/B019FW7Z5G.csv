7575273,3,B019FW7Z5G,"JOHNNY WINTER-DOWN & DIRTY: Filmmaker GREG OLIVER's documentary DOWN & DIRTY chronicles everyone's favorite Lone Star state guitar guru JOHN DAWSON WINTER III, packing plenty of recent, revealing interviews into eighty-five minutes. He reminisces about everything from heroin addiction to his love for ROBERT JOHNSON, as accolades pour in from admirers like BILLY GIBBONS, DEREK TRUCKS and Johnny's soul-slinging sibling EDGAR WINTER. A fiercely dedicated disciple of the blues, JW's rock & roll period backed by RICK DERRINGER is glossed over, and strangely, his acclaimed series of comeback platters for the ALLIGATOR label isn't mentioned. Other than some brief clips from Woodstock, there's virtually no archival concert footage from Winter's half decade as blooze-rock's great white hope (I'd recommend the music-packed dvd LIVE THROUGH THE 70'S for his peak on-stage period). Another puzzler is the so-called ""hour of exclusive bonus material"", most of which consists of footage already seen in the film. For a more in-depth look into the life and times of this titanic Texas troubadour, check out his compelling autobiography RAISIN' CAIN: THE WILD & RAUCOUS STORY OF JOHNNY WINTER.

7575274,5,B019FW7Z5G,Exactly the documentary I was looking for! Really happy Paul Nelson helped prolong Johnny's time on earth. Overall the documentary rocks makes you laugh and cry at times (especially the early 90's footage) and encourages you to keep on playing.,1457568000,4,244,5.125
7575275,4,B019FW7Z5G,I could have used seeing a lot archive footage of Johnny from when he was making his name but I'll settle for what's here...thanks for making this doc on Johnny.,1457395200,,161,4.4
7575276,2,B019FW7Z5G,"Kudos to Paul Nelson for bringing  johnny back from the dead from his addictions and psyc issues! Been a fan for over 40 yrs , love his last 2 records,but this movie really was bad, there is no concert footage from his heydays in the 60's ( except woodstock ) 70's or early 80's or interviews from that time. It shows johnny on the road  for his last 2 records which was interesting at times. It hit a all time low when they were showing johnny really drunk and acting like a fool with encouragement from the band ( not a good idea for a old dope fiend ) it almost felt Johnny was be exploited, for the last dollar they could squeeze out of him",1457222400,6,644,4.103174603174603
7575277,5,B019FW7Z5G,"It's a no brainer if you are a Johnny Winter fan. This movie will make you smile and maybe shed a tear for good reasons. I didn't want it to end. Johnny's mind was very sharp and detailed recalling stories and he's very honest. This was very well put together. You get to see what its like following Johnny around on tour, touches on personal stories and emotions. Lots of info. I would buy all the footage left off the film if I could. It's that great in my opinion. My only gripe is that it has 1 hour of bonus footage with certain things repeated from the main film, and the reversed photo (which is nice) on the disc makes Johnny look like he plays left handed. Not an accurate representation. Still a great film. Thank you for making this!!!!",1457136000,9,747,4.304964539007092
7575278,5,B019FW7Z5G,"This is a MUST see for Winter fans.  Its clear that Paul Nelson had Johnny on the right track and he was getting better.  There are several lump in the throat feel good moments and a few laughs too.  I never thought I'd get so much personal insight on a musician that I've admired since I was a kid.  I saw Johnny lots of times in the 90's and many weren't pretty.  In the late 90's and early 2000's he didn't sing he mumbled.  In the film you find out why.  But when he sings ""Georgia On My Mind"" at a Karaoke bar, not only his is voice there, it will pull at your heart strings.",1457136000,14,580,3.9482758620689653
7575279,5,B019FW7Z5G,"There haven't been many video releases (official) with Johnny Winter material/interviews etc....so this was a welcome and long awaited release.  Worth the wait.

It takes you through his life and into it at the same time. The funny, the sad, the bad, the music it's all here. I'm not going to babble on and I'm sure there'll be critics but if you're a Johnny Winter fan you'll LOVE this release!!! Kudos to Paul Nelson for what he did for Johnny's career, life and this wonderful documentary. Thank You Paul!",1457049600,21,477,4.370786516853933
7575282,5,B019FW7Z5G,If you're a Johnny Winter fan this movie has some nice surprises. A great look at Johnny at the end of his career (and the rest of his career). Well done and entertaining. Thanks to Paul Nelson for all his help to Johnny as a player and manager and friend. Lots of good playing and interesting interviews. I loved Johnny and thought this was well worth the money I paid for the DVD - he's still the best electric blues guitar player I ever heard. Quite a story.,1486166400,4,461,4.25

7575287,1,B019FW7Z5G,"I've been a huge Johnny fan since the early 70's and saw him perform live dozens and dozens of times.  I was disappointed that this biographical movie did not show Johnny's past,  to go along with how Johnny reminisced.  I was expecting more.",1479254400,,242,4.5813953488372094
7575288,5,B019FW7Z5G,"Really well done. Shows a real affection from Paul and the band members towards Johnny. Includes some nice photos and facts that span his whole career. Some touching moments such as when they drive Johnny past his childhood home. He meets the owner but can't bring himself to go in and take a look. Some funny stuff too like when Johnny and his crew are singing the theme song to  ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" and he knows all the frickin' words! Great doc that really shows the human side of things, not the wild rock and roll persona we all know.",1476835200,3,540,4.4
7575289,4,B019FW7Z5G,Fast delivery...no problems with seller. Great documentary although I was very disappointed that Johnny's Lazer Guitar was not mentioned at all in the film. People talked about the Gibson Firebird as his main guitar but as far as I'm concerned the played the white Lazer a lot more.,1476748800,,282,4.895833333333333
7575290,5,B019FW7Z5G,Great doc Sorry to see him go another great one gone. one of the most under rated guitar players,1476748800,,96,4.105263157894737

7575300,5,B019FW7Z5G,Excellent documentary and music.,1470009600,,32,7.25
7575301,4,B019FW7Z5G,"This is a video strictly for the long time fan and not for the new or casual listener. They are advised to stick with the live clips from '69 to about '90. For us long time fans this is sort of a bittersweet farewell. Paul Nelson did a helluva job cleaning up Winter and his business and the real tearjerker moment is the home video where he's presented with the empty methadone pill. Having tried to meet him and get my albums autographed since I first saw him in '87, a situation that had become completely hopeless a decade later, then finally meeting him a month before his death, this scene hits home.

Some of the content was exaggerated in the advertising and that was a bit of letdown. For example, there was talk of how raw and intimate the documentary is by doing things like letting the cameras into his therapy sessions. However, no deep dark secrets are there to be revealed. The shrink session is merely Johnny talking about how pissed off he'd get when the other kids would mess with him growing up. He didn't have any hangups about it so why include it? The psychological analysis that the shrink presents is overinflated fluff and an insult to anyone who's even casually read up on psychology. Stick to Jung, this BluesRock guitar.

The weaker content and the artificial inflation to use it as a selling point was unnecessary. To have a firsthand document of his final years is plenty in itself and to see one of our favorite guitarists living his rocking chair years clear and healthy and enjoying his life is a treat in itself. All long time Winter fans will want this in their collection.",1470009600,,1608,4.541379310344827

7575303,4,B019FW7Z5G,As a long time Johnny Winter fan I really liked this documentary.  It's a little slow at first but when it gets into Johnny's history it starts to pick up and gets very interesting.  Would like to have seen more performance footage of Johnny in his prime but you can get that in some of the other DVD releases. A must for JW fans and a look into the twilight days of an amazing blues-rock musician.  Johnny is sorely missed.,1468627200,2,424,4.275

7575314,5,B019FW7Z5G,This DVD made me cry about Johnny not being with us anymore. My wife and I had the fortune of seeing him and meeting him just 3 months before he died. He wasn't well then and shouldn't have been on tour. This  documentary will have any JW fan in tears. He was so frail and weak. My only wish is that it should have had more old performance videos in it to show how great he was.,1463616000,4,378,3.909090909090909

7575318,5,B019FW7Z5G,"I had my first real relationship in 1972. It was amazing. I literally wore it out. Johnny Winter And was the greatest music I'd ever heard.

7575325,5,B019FW7Z5G,"As any Johnny Winter fan would know, he was a great guitarist, but he was also a complex and damaged person. I saw him fifty times or more in concert. His guitar genius was never in question. To witness his reclamation was amazing. Kudos to Paul Nelson for his patience and persistence in saving a rock 'roll legend. It is a glimpse into the life and mind of a brilliant bluesman.",1461456000,,380,4.366197183098592
7575326,5,B019FW7Z5G,"A very good history lesson on The man, his style of music,and the blues in general. It also takes a little look back at the beginning of Johnny's and Edgars introduction to music and the prejudices that they had to encure growing up in a very conservative and sterotype atmosphere of the times in the Golden Triangle area of Texas. I myself grew up in Port Arthur, and can relate to the critisism he and his brother delt with. A must buy for all blues lovers,Johnny Winters fans,and ALL guitar slingers,and wanna be's !  :)",1461456000,,523,4.505263157894737
7575327,1,B019FW7Z5G,"I was so excited to see this but it was not like I hoped.  I was expecting much more music, his guitar/song style etc. and his achievements and a focus on the inspiration that he was/is to many people.  Instead, much of the story focused on his problems.  No offense to the 'author', but anyone can make a story out of one's moments of weakness and despair.  It takes a real artist to present an artistic view of a person who became something more than his challenges.",1461110400,2,468,4.344827586206897
7575328,1,B019FW7Z5G,"After watching a few times and letting a few other blues fans check it out.....Don't be misled, this movie is not what Johnny was about. This film shows his last days. These so called friends dragged him all over Europe. The scenes of him drunk and totally lost is very sad. I'll always remember Johnny as a hell bent slide playin bluesman.....save your money and buy one of his recordings. NO STARS!",1461024000,2,400,4.569444444444445
7575329,5,B019FW7Z5G,"Anyone that follows rock and blues history needs to see this. Paul, Scott and Tommy did a fantastic job as a band and Paul Nelson is to be praised for his help in bringing a rock and blues legend that is Johnny Winter back from the brink of destruction. This movie is informative, telling, and gives an inside look at the man that was, Johnny ""Cool Daddy"" Winter. If you love the blues or rock, this is a must see for sure.
Thank you, Paul Nelson for all you did for Johnny Winter.",1459641600,4,481,4.182795698924731
