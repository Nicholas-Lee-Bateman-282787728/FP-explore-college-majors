I've seen it several times and still am not completely sure I understand it.",1513728000,,179,4.5625
7978074,2,B00007KK3I,"What the heck is this movie about. The plot was confusing so I cant really say too much about it. The animation was fairly good. The movie went to fast, not letting events sink in but instead one after another (headach). The beginning was a bore, actually the whole movie was. I didn't really even pay attention to it having it play on my comp. while I watched TV (thts how bad it was) Its one of those movies that if someone died you'de laugh. The music for the credits was cool though I had to admit (some techno Japanese music) when watching this movie all I really thought was random characters, moon, girl with big yellow hair, another girl with big yellow hair....ahhhhhh clones (plot twist......interesting?) nothing sketchy in the movie, one nudity scene, nothing to get your hopes up (not that you would be seeing this movie for tht ) This movie just was boring. Im not going to go into the movies plot because there wasn't really one plus if there was it would be hard to understand really! I would save your money on this one and buy some other anime (yea I kno helpful) just not this!",1056672000,2,1096,4.430693069306931
7978075,3,B00007KK3I,"In the not to distant future, mankind colonizes the moon. However, one of the main companies behind the huge domed cities on the moon's surface appears to be planning on using some alien technology they've found to create a new weapon. A group of special infiltrators called Bounty Dogs come from Earth to investigate. One of them keeps having flashbacks about his sister dying, and is somehow linked to a bunch of evil little girl clones of her. What proceeds is a series of kickass car chases similar to BUBBLEGUM CRISIS, and action sequences with mechas designed by GHOST IN THE SHELL's Masamune Shirow. This isn't exactly the greatest 2-episode OVA ever made, but it is pretty up there if your a fan of action sci-fi. If you liked the manga SERAPHIC FEATHER, then this is right up your alley.",1045008000,2,796,4.692857142857143
7978076,3,B00007KK3I,"The movie was pretty good. It takes a while for the action to start, and when it does it doesn't last long.  Although this was a good movie overall, I expected more from Manga.",961459200,,176,4.176470588235294
7978077,4,B00007KK3I,"Directed by Hiroshi Negishi. The story goes like this: In the future mankind has colonized the moon. Cities and all that. But there are forces that have nothing but hatred for the men and women who have transformed the  face of the moon and don't want mankind to succeed. Strange waves of energy  come from the dark side of the moon where a centuries old alien (the  sleeper) waits for the day it will arise to spread distruction. The bounty  arrive on the moon to investigate and find themselves caught in a desperate  attempt to destroy ""the sleeper"" before it awakes and obliterates  all mankind on the moon - and earth........I'd recommend it to anyone who  enjoys sci-fi anime.",960681600,,682,4.680672268907563
