1430810,5,B00005J74O,"This is an absolute gem of a film which is loses nothing on repeated viewings. A fine cast who are attractive without being Hollywood glamour types give uniformly well-rounded performances, with Bray Poor the obvious standout. The dialogue is clever yet believable - articulate and earthy. The two Ninas are both gorgeous in their own individual ways (as is the bartender). The plot is nicely paced with no real surprises which allows the audience to concentrate on the characters. The only false note is the character of the literary agent who could have easily been dispensed with. But that's a minor quibble. Everything else about the film is marvellous - a small movie with a great big heart.",1153526400,2,696,4.906779661016949
1430811,3,B00005J74O,"One wishes to like this film, to find that in it which will it make it recommendable, low budget underdog independent production that it is, led by a first-time director, having a colourful urban setting with an emphasis upon romantic relationships, and an attractive young cast; however, a drastic flaw in the writing quickly casts doubt upon its having a chance to rise above mediocrity.  The core of its story consists of the experiences of Marty (Ron Livingston), a would-be novelist living in Manhattan, expatriate from Maine, struggling ineffectively with the familiar conundrum of young men seeking amorous satisfaction until he, within the space of a few days, discovers that two attractive young women, each named Nina, are smitten with him, and he therefore must face an inevitable decision to select one of them, thereby abandoning the second, all while assuring that the liaisons will not converge to his total loss of romance.  From his roost upon a bar stool, Marty's best friend Dave (Bray Poor), performs as Chorus, face to the camera, to describe his pal's adventures in love, along with his own, with events moving to a somewhat predictable climax hastened by Marty's carelessness in not keeping his lovers separate.  The mentioned shortcoming in the writing is a penchant of tyro scriptor/director Neil Turwitz to have each of his characters speak in the same manner, as dialogue for all is distinguished by consistent syntax, vocabulary, and rhythm, whether man or woman, and only the skill of Poor (who gains acting honours in this piece) in maintaining his precision of timing, and natural actress Cara Buono as one of the Ninas, somewhat leavens an otherwise monochromic script.  An overly naturalistic tenor in the screenplay frequently grates upon one's sensibilities, but a decision to prevent some flubs from winding up on the cutting room floor works well enough, although those components of post-production that require dubbing and mixing are often errant, in line with generally woeful D.J. selection that comprises most of the scoring for a film that sinks from its shallowness.",1098316800,,2110,5.1608187134502925
1430812,5,B00005J74O,"""Two Ninas"" is funny, very real, and has an ambience that is quite addictive. The film had me hooked after viewing it only once!
On one level, this is a light-weight movie with low profile actors and an unknown director. Even the plot of this romantic comedy is unoriginal.
But ""Two Ninas"" is youthful and charming. The performances of the entire cast is surprisingly excellent. I loved the intelligent mood and the 'feel' of film with New York as the backdrop. I found myself thinking about the characters long after I first viewed it. I was so infatuated with the Nina characters of Amanda Peet and Cara Buono that I went out and bought the DVD.
Ron Livingston plays Marty Sachs with a perfect balance of sensitivity and 'nurdyness' that rings true. Marty's life in New York is not going too well. His sex life has been dry for at least a year; he hates his job working on box scores for a New York newspaper; and he can't find an agent to sell his novel. Just as Marty considers moving back to Maine to work in his family's business, he meets two beautiful woman named Nina.
Marty's hyper active romantic life is a double-edged sword. Although he's enjoying it, sometimes the complications are too much and he f**ks up royally. Marty's experiences are narrated by his best freind, Dave Trout, nicely portrayed by Bray Poor.
I thought that Ron Livingston had more chemestry going with Amanda Peet as Nina Haris, but she was not the character he finally falls in love with. Cara Buono as Nina Cohen had some nice moments, particularly at the break-up scene at the Rodeo Bar and at the make-up scene at the end of the movie. But it was Amanda Peet that stole my heart.
All in all, a very fine film that I recommend highly.",1024617600,20,1722,4.522435897435898
1430813,5,B00005J74O,"I really liked this funny and intelligent movie very very much, even though the plot is rather unoriginal and could be seen on many a TV sitcom. However, the cast of the ""Two Ninas"" is outstanding and they manage to pull it off VERY successfully. The acting is right on; the dialogue is crisp; and the characters come through smartly. Ron Livingston portrays Marty Sachs, a slightly-nurdy, struggling writer who hates his job, hasn't gotten laid in 17 months, and is considering leaving New York for Maine to work in his family business. Suddenly, he gets involved with two beautiful women named Nina. They both fall in love with him and want a commitment. After juggling the relation with both women, Marty discovers he really loves only one, Nina Cohen. Unfortunately, both relationships end badly. I will end this review here, except to say that I liked this movie a lot. In a nutshell, it's the exceptionally fine cast that pulls this movie off.",1022630400,5,949,4.7926829268292686
1430814,4,B00005J74O,"This is a movie about Marty, a writer that haven't had a relationship in a long time and no luck with his book so is thinking to moving back with his parents, but then he meets Nina and thinks that things are starting to change, but she wants to go slow, so a few days later she meets Nina, this is a whole different woman, this one is the opposite of the first one, so he stars a relationship with both of them. Here begins the story which takes a few turns until Marty finds his true love and makes things right.
