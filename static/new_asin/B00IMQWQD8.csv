6281770,5,B00IMQWQD8,A super great series filmed in AZ near the road I traveled every summer as a kid. A good motivation to learn about the pony express and the role it played in uniting unionists of CA with the unionists back east just before the civil war broke out. Watched it twice already!,1485648000,,273,4.269230769230769

8643407,5,B00IMQWQD8,"I have received my order for ""the young riders, The complete first season"".  I was impressed with the  quality of the picture.  It's even more clear than the ones on the ""Encore Channel! I had never watched this program before. When it first came on tv, I was working full time night shift. Now I am retired, and taking care of my son, who is ill, and he loves Westerns, so we watch western shows. I fell in love with this show, the first time I watched it!  I came to love all the characters!  If you liked ""The Young Riders"", you will love this set!  It's excellent!!",1515196800,,569,4.222222222222222

8643411,5,B00IMQWQD8,"A well-done late 80's/early 90's television western series with no big-name stars but with some fine up-and-coming actors.  There are a number of ""guest stars"" every week -- some very good and some not so good.  As for the main characters, each has his/her own appeal and value to the series, but the two best actors and the two most indispensable characters are Anthony Zerbe as ""Teaspoon"" Hunter and Josh Brolin as James Butler (""Wild Bill"") Hickok.  They deserve the greatest amount of camera time, but in some episodes they are relegated to minor supporting roles -- to the detriment of the episode, IMO.  Despite some historical inaccuracies (J. B. Hickok and Jesse James never rode for the Pony Express), and some flaws in geography (showing mountains in the background for a setting that's supposed to be in Kansas), the series is well-written with intriguing storylines, contains superb cinematography, and generally excellent acting by the main characters and guest stars.  Watching the series from the beginning becomes addictive, and you wonder why it lasted only three seasons.  (Note: You can now watch/record the entire series on the Encore Westerns channel.)",1492560000,,1173,5.147368421052631
