4073769,5,B00366E1E6,I saw Mary and Max at the Sundance Film Festival and it was by far my favorite!  An amazing piece of work. I highly recommend it.,1273017600,3,129,3.9615384615384617
4073770,5,B00366E1E6,"One thing animation does very well is give us great art. But what it rarely does is actually create realistic human characters with all their inconvenient imperfections.  This movie does both...and I consider ""Mary and Max"" one of the most daring films of 2009.

Those familiar with the animator - Adam Elliot - may recall he won an Oscar for ""Harvie Krumpet"" in the category of
short animated films.  This film is his major oevre, an expanded version of the shorter film, albeit with different characters.

Ostensibly, the story is about a friendship between two unlikely partners.  Max is an overweight, depressed, New York Jew suffering from serious mental illness. Mary is  8 years old, chubby, and confused.  Both are lonely and underappreciated...and through the chance occurrence of a letter from Mary to Max, they develop a deep and real
friendship as pen pals.

Now, in many respects, both characters are very flawed human beings.  And that is what makes the film remarkable.  So many animated films from Finding Nemo to Beauty and the Beast end with a successful quest of the hero and heroine. This storyline is far more subtle.  Both Mary and Max battle the everyday troubles of modern life - finding a way to fit in a world when they don't fit in at all. Searching for an influence on this movie in the history of cinema, I might select the Oscar best picture ""Marty"" which filmed a love affair between two ordinary people in the 1950's.

I cannot finish the review without saying something about the extraordinary recreation of New York City in ClayMation.  I rather liked the fact the film uses claymation for the characters because it renders them far more ""earthy"" than the bright, digital CGI formula so popular today.

This is a film with dark moments and tender moments and annoying moments...in sum a film about life as it is really lived.",1265068800,41,1859,4.786833855799373
4073771,4,B00366E1E6,"Mary and Max is an independent claymation flick from Australia, with a darkly comic theme about a lonely and misunderstood 8-year-old girl who strikes up an unlikely and disturbing correspondence and friendship with a 48-year-old overweight depressive male diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. While that sounds unlikely enough as a topic for an animated film, what was truly unexpected was the moving power of its simple message, achieved without resorting to sentimentalism or cliche.

The film, apparently based on a true story, plays like Wallace and Gromit conceived by Oliver Sacks and imagined by David Lynch and Robert Crumb. The animated characters, who tend to be overweight with exaggerated melancholy expressions, are nevertheless enormously expressive - and the film seamlessly shifts from the muted colors of the rundown Australian suburb where Mary lives to the expressive black and white of Max's New York City.

Mary (Toni Collette) is a curious and lonely girl, whose father is unavailable and whose mother is an alcoholic kleptomaniac and whose neighbors are each in their own way inscrutable. Confronted by questions the adults around her are unwilling to answer, she selects Max's name at random from an American phonebook and writes an inquisitive letter to a complete stranger. Initially thrown for a loop by this unexpected query, Max detects a kindred spirit and responds to her letter with complete sincerity. So begins a peculiar correspondence, fraught throughout with misunderstanding but culminating in a lifelong friendship that is able to carry them both through a great deal of personal misfortune and tragedy.

The voice of Phillip Seymour Hoffman invests the character of Max with a deeply sincere confusion about the peculiar games that people play. A card carrying communist and atheist, he nevertheless wears the skullcap he wore as a child, when his mother taught him babies came from egg-laying rabbis. He is honest to a fault, incapable of saying the kinds of things people like to hear; his imaginary friend, a psychiatrist by the name of Mr. Ravioli, stopped speaking to him after his real psychiatrist convinced him he was no longer necessary.

Mary and Max was dark and tender and strange and disconcerting and lovely. Its simple theme, conveyed lightly and through dark circumstance, is captured in a concluding quotation by Ethel Mumford: ""God gave us relatives. Thank God we can choose our friends.""",1260403200,83,2446,5.264102564102564
4073772,5,B00366E1E6,"From Academy Award-winning Australian director Adam Elliot, maker of the wonderfully weird and demented&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harvie-Krumpet/dp/B000WZAE54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harvie Krumpet</a>&nbsp;(Best Animated Short, 2004 -- you can see it on YouTube), comes another equally weird and demented new animation called ""Mary and Max"". His work is not very well known in the US, but it's fantastic and should be more widely seen by fans of animation and dark, morbid humor.

It is the story of an unlikely friendship that develops between a chubby, homely, and socially maladjusted 8 year old girl in Melbourne, Australia named Mary Daisy Dinkle and a severely overweight and neurotic middle-aged Russian-Jewish man in New York with Asperger syndrome, named Max Jerry Horowitz. Mary has no friends and is taken care of by her alcoholic and kleptomaniac mother. On a chance visit to the post office, she finds an American phonebook and decides to write to someone to ask where babies come from while her mother tries to steal boxes of envelopes. The name she randomly chose was Max's, whom she sends a letter and a candy bar. They share a love for chocolate, a Smurfs-like show called The Noblets, and a need for friendship. In each other, they find kindred spirits and what follows is two decades of humorous correspondence and weird gift exchanges.

Voiced by an almost unrecognizable Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he plays the part of Max perfectly. There are no words to convey the frequency and weirdness of the deadpan humor. You'll just have to watch it. Literally every minute or two is filled with some weird joke, dialog, or visual gag. Owing to Max's autism, there's a lot of random humor and non sequiturs. This is probably the only animation where you'll see a ""feline rectal thermometer"" or learn that ""turtles can breathe through their anuses"" (which is actually true).

The film is wonderfully stylish and richly detailed. The film takes place between the 1970's and 1990's and is full of nostalgic images from that time, with some very nice modeling of a grimy New York City. Visually, everything in Mary's world is monochromatic brown, and everything in Max's is black and white, punctuated by spots of color like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B001R4KQDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>. It deals with loneliness, depression, atheism, and above all, friendship.

Lastly, I need to mention that this is DEFINITELY not one for the kids, if you are expecting wholesome family entertainment like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wallace-Gromit-The-Complete-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B002DR2GJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wallace & Gromit: The Complete Collection [Blu-ray</a>]. The film is filled with abundant adult-themed humor, numerous sexual references, as well as instances of cartoony nudity. It is dialog driven and likely to bore them anyway.

4073826,5,B00366E1E6,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"" (animated or otherwise).  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

First things first: This claymation movie is NOT for kids.  That out of the way, I related to both Max and Mary a lot (even though I'm a dude and much older than Mary, sue me, haha).  Hope no one had too much of a problem with the age difference of their friendship since I think, deep down, most of us are just looking for a little connection with a kindred spirit in this world.  We're all only human and flawed, after all, but I think mostly good hearted and just trying to do our best, as I said.  Loved the quote right at the end, something like: ""God gave us our relatives.  Thank God we can choose our friends.""  So damn true.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494547200,5,1742,4.451104100946372

4073829,5,B00366E1E6,"Not many animated movies deal with poverty, depression, agoraphobia, autism, anxiety, obesity and soul crushing loneliness.  This movie focuses on these issues but manages to uplifting, warm and really funny.  The stop-motion animation is distinctively lovely.  It provides an excellent blend of reality and stylization.  It's a dark but sweet movie about how friendship knows no borders and the truly deep impacts it has on other peoples lives.

4073856,5,B00366E1E6,"Loved it.  It's a story about two distant disfunctional characters who become pen-pals.  Overall, I'd call it a comedy, and there's some dark humor here.  It's quirky, with many adult themes.  It's narrated by an older voice, but with a sort of children's story tone.  Nevertheless, I probably wouldn't let the younger kids watch it.  There's a clear interrogation of our relationships and views regarding mental handicaps, and an exploration of the functionality behind things which (comically) appear to be disfunctional.

4073940,4,B00366E1E6,"Its not often that a movie confuses me on how to watch it, especially an animated one. Mary and Max is one of those movies that falls into the weird category. I went into this one with no knowledge about it, aside from hearing that it was a great stop motion movie, but I didn't know anything about the plot. It took me about 3 hours to watch this one because I kept pausing it and doing other things. For some reason, I couldn't focus on it, mainly because I didn't know what exactly I was watching. This isn't a kids movie, with there being some sexual talk, certain words and descriptions used, and some pretty dark themes. And yet its almost playing itself off as one with the style. There are some very cutesy characters here, with some unique art direction and adult themes. Its a weird combination, and halfway through the movie, it finally clicked with me. Mary and Max is definitely unique to say the least.

Mary is a young girl living in Australia with her parents who don't seem to care for her much. Her dad is obsessed with taxidermy, and spends most of his free time in the shed stuffing birds. Her mom is a raging alcoholic who borrows a lot of things from stores, no matter how inexpensive they are. Mary also has an unsightly birth mark right in the middle of her forehead that the other kids make fun of, and she has no one to talk to aside from a rooster her dad picked up on the side of the road after it fell from a truck on the way to the slaughterhouse. Some life, huh? She wonders certain things and soon gets the address for a man in New York, sending him a letter and telling her a little about herself, then asking questions like where babies come from in America. Its a very cute, innocent letter that ends up in the hands of Max, a 40-something year old man who cant smile with his mouth but says he smiles in his brain, has had a lot of weird jobs over the years, tells her that babies from from eggs laid by Rabbis if you're Jewish, nuns if you're Catholic, and prostitutes if you're an atheist. At least, thats what he was told. Max doesnt have any friends either, and writes Mary a very long letter, and includes a picture of himself. When Marys mom opens the letter, she doesnt think highly of her young daughter writing to a strange old man, and tries to get rid of it, but it ends up in Marys hands, and the two continue to write to each other, talking about the problems they're having in their lives.

The majority of the movie is Mary and Max writing to each other. Things come up in each characters life, and they let the other know about it, explaining why they haven't written in so long, etc. Its rare for something funny or amusing to happen because both characters are in such bad situations that you feel bad for them all the time. On one hand, you have Mary who is neglected, in love with someone who obviously isn't for her (take one look at his shirt when they go to college), and is getting a lot of her life lessons from this old man in another part of the world who has his own issues. Max has Aspergers Syndrome, cant express himself easily, has anxiety attacks when he reads specific parts in Marys letters, is overweight because of his love for chocolate and other bad foods, and much more. Again, it took until about halfway through the movie for me to realize oh, this is a drama. I kept waiting for something happy or good to happen, but it rarely did. You want the best for both characters, and yet they seem to be on a downward slope no matter what. Where Mary and Max really succeeds is presenting problems a lot of us have at an early age, adolescence and in the later years. I didn't have a terrible life when I was a kid, but I did have bad depression from age 12 to 29, and a lot of what Mary was going through hit home, as well as a few of Maxs problems. It may be done with clay and have a cute little girl and an old guy that looks like Shrek, but this could have been done just as well as a live action film because its so real.

The only thing I don't care for in the movie is the narration. I think it couldve worked just fine without the narrator, and if Mary and some of the other characters had more to say.

I don't recommend Mary and Max to just anyone. Some of what it contains may go over the heads of some viewers, and I say that without trying to come off as some kind of uppity film snob. Watch this one with an open mind, and don't expect anything from it. Its animated, but has themes just as powerful as any dramatic live action movie. This is definitely one Im going to watch again later on and see how I like it then, knowing what it is Im watching.",1447113600,,4636,4.1881298992161256

4074008,5,B00366E1E6,"I thought this was an excellent movie. Yes, the world it presents through the perspective of two unique characters may be dark and to some depressing, but despite their loneliness and their struggles they manage despite incalculable odds to achieve fulfillment and meaning through their friendship and acceptance of one another. This is not Hollywood or Disney, which is to say rainbows, rescues, high drama, and perfection uncomfortably are all absent, but the world it depicts is far less unrealistic than the dreamscapes most viewers are accustomed to watch on the silver screen to reassure themselves their real existence isn't cast in black and white. Max has Aspergers and claims not to understand the logic of others and what is expected of him but interestingly his friend Mary, a child of 8, is equally confused and challenged to find love, companionship and meaning. Both must learn to accept themselves and love themselves first; both must learn to accept the imperfections of the other such that Aspergers comes to be a mirror of the human condition. This is why Marys letters have such resonance for Max, and why the seemingly random questions they put to one another are so similar. Both suffer in similar ways. Study the other secondary characters and the challenges they face (or choose not to face) are the same. But, despite the banal repetitive presence of death and loss in the film, hope exists. For me the message is that one can break free from ones existential agoraphobia/homophobia (i.e., mental barriers raised by concepts) and cross the road to bring happiness to one another just as Marys neighbor finds the courage to leave his home and deliver Maxs life-saving package to her of his complete collection of noblets. Even in the denial of meeting, Mary and Max do hold hands and the gesture represents a profound communion. His life had come to feel complete. His great act was to be able to grant forgiveness and in his doing so she is able to read on the wall the sweep, the height and significance of her existence. In seeing what she meant to him she finds herself even in the very place of perhaps her greatest loss. The baby she carries with her also points to the sense of a new beginning. This movie is complex and sensitive, humorous, and profound in so many ways. It manages to be comical when it is most dark, and yet that humor is paradoxically a reassurance that for all of life's randomness, a letter sent to a random address in a phone book can reach the right recipient. The noblets show how little is required to relieve us of our pain. No, the film may not be for children, its message is too refined for the very young to understand, but I suspect the film is for the wondering, suffering child in all of us.",1429747200,,2756,4.696280991735537

4074011,5,B00366E1E6,"Set during 1970 to the early 90s, Adam Elliott's ""Max and Mary"" is a film that is bound to touch your heart in more than just one way. Based on a true story, Mary and Max is a beautifully clay animated film. It is about a relationship that spans an entire two  continent's distance. It tells the tale of Mary, a lonely young girl who lives in Australia and an overweight Jewish man named Max Horovitz, living in New York who has Asperger's Syndrome.

Out of random chance, Mary decides to have an American pen pal and finds Max's name and address in a phone book. She writes this down and sends him a letter. This sparks an incredible and unforeseen friendship, as they both share the same interests in terms of food and television series. The other thing that they share in common is that both are lonely, and seek companionship. While they have their similarities, their reasons for what they do and how they go about it are very opposite. Mary is very innocent and curious being at such a young age, while Max sees the world in a whole other light. Max is her answers to all of her questions, and through their friendship they help one another in various ways as time progresses. A friendship that spans for over 20 years, Mary and Max is a brilliant claymation that stresses the values of friendship, and other darker toned themes throughout the movie.

Animated beautifully, the characters all have something to contribute. Emotions are dramatic, and very realistic. The use of color although there not being an entire array,work well with our characters. Mary is located in the suburbs of Australia, which is depicted as a brown like tint, while Max's location in New York is represented in black and white. The differences between the two both in location as well as color work wonderfully. The music score gives so much to the movie itself, especially the main theme, ""Perpetuum Mobile."" It is a song filled with strings and piano, and the long strands of crescendos and elongated notes are amazing. It flows and harmonizes in such a way that it leaves you feeling warm and happy.

While Max and Mary is a well written movie, I do highly advise it not to be watched with small children around. It holds a great deal of adult humor, as well as it does provide some mature scenes and implications that should not be seen with young ones around. Despite having some of its dark humor and funnier, maturer moments, it is a film that will really make you have ""the feels"" inside. The ups and downs, struggles, hardships, happier times, and overall the friendship between Max and Mary is something you will feel heart felt about for a very long time.",1421452800,,2652,4.600422832980972

4074051,3,B00366E1E6,"What a weird movie. Not in premise, but just in the characters and the way it's set up. Black and White and Chocolate Hotdogs and such. So peculiar, so strange, so inventive. My father watched this movie with me, his words after watching it ""Weird."" It is, I had my head turning after the first line came out. 'Mary and Max' is a film that shouldn't be viewed by children; it deals with a load of mature subjects and is completely inappropriate for children. I just thought I might as well say that before starting my review. Onto my review of the weird 'Mary and Max'.

'Mary and Max' tells the tale of a young girl, Mary (Voiced by Bethany Whitmore) a lonely girl, who befriends a man named Max (Voiced by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) via penpaling. They bond, and learn more and more about each other through the years.

I donno how else to explain the film. It's a film you need to watch to get the plot in full form.

Something I enjoyed a lot about the film was the switch between color (Mary's side) and black and white (Max's side). Visually, it's interesting. The tone, you'll notice switches as the color switches. From light (Mary's side) to dark and gloomy (Max's side). I liked that idea, because it better sets the mood, and feeling you'd be going through as well as the characters emotions. And that one slice of color on Max's head is something to look at. A single star on a bleak sky

The animation is spectacular really. The tiny bits of detail in the characters s there, and their worlds look completely real. The animation has dull shades of color, but it sets the mood, and works overall. Its clay-mation that you know has been worked on for a long while. It's sharp, inventive, and show's craftsmanship and hard work.

The character designs are sharp to the tip. Max is expesically interesting in form. His fat, pardon, is well detailed, as well as his facial expressions, which run out quit well.

 'Mary and Max' is never really engaging; it just plays at the same speed, and bores along. It's not very original, but has surprises that I had not thought of, but never really make you tense up. The film tends to become dull at moments, it's never exciting. Or thrilling, or full of life. It's just plain old dull. Colors, and story, and dialogue. It's all dull to the point of depression. The film loses you midway through after picking you up, because you get bored with the same picture of a bleak, bleak world for those two leads. You wish it became light and fun but it doesn't, even the jokes, which do make you laugh come out as creepy and sad.
The dialogue is of its own, good. Some of the dialogue is witty; other snippet's sad and depressing. It's all good and doesn't come out corny or cheesy or however you want to put it, the dialogue, which runs the whole movie, is pretty sharp.

In particular I found the character development to be very solid. You learn more about the characters then you'd thought you'd have, and by the end you know about everything the character thinks or does, and how they act and why they act that way, you understand their opinions and emotions. That was solid work, and in the end you do become emotionally attached to the characters in some weird form.

The problem is the plot. It's just not enough to keep you tuned in. The plot, is just so thin and unoriginal, you are not kept interested from it. The film sports interesting ideas, but overall it's squandered by the way to easy main plot.

All and All, 'Mary and Max' is a very weird film, with beautiful animation, and solid character development but squandered by the overpowering dark and gloomy tone, and thin plot stretched its limits. C+ 3/7/14

P.S: The film may not be for the mainstream film audience, but it will delight the more art-house filmgoers. So, I separately rate the film a 4 Stars rating. As a film it's good, but as for me I didn't care much for it.",1404691200,,3889,4.4633802816901404

Their correspondence leads to a lifelong friendship, but both character's lives are fraught with difficulties.  As for disturbing scenes, well, there is a mother who drinks heavily, a woman falls into a deep depression and Asperger's Syndrome is shown in all of it's anxiety and need for routine. There are quite a few goldfish who die, and genuine emotions run a wide spectrum.  Both characters have memories of being teased and bullied when they were young, and a few colorful characters pepper the entire movie.

4074165,5,B00366E1E6,"Mary and Max (Adam Elliot, 2009)

I will try to draw this out to review length, but it has been some ten months since I saw Mary and Max, and it has been hard for me to find anything to say about it but this: Mary and Max is, by far, the best film I saw in 2013. In fact, it is one of the best films I have seen in any year; as of this writing, it is currently sitting at #16 on my 1000 Best list. (The next film down the list I first viewed in 2013 is Berberian Sound Studio, which sits at #32.) It is a profoundly affecting, perfectly-related story with near endless heart. While I know there are people out there who fit the description, I simply can't imagine anyone not loving this. And to top it all offit's claymation.

Plot: Mary (voice of Blackwood's Bethany Whitmore) is a lonely Australian girl who decides she needs a pen pal. She goes to the library, piecks out a phone book at random, and then stabs her finger down on a name, copies the address, and writes a letter. In this way, she introduces herself to Max (voice of Love Liza's Philip Seymour Hoffman), a forty-four-year-old shut-in from New York City. Max is, at first, hesitant, but, with a few interruptions, thus begins a twenty-year correspondence between the two, and theyboth with mental issues (Mary is depressed, Max has a disorder the revelation of which is one of the movie's big twiststhough many who have friends who suffer the same disorder will be able to pinpoint it long before Max does)find their best friends in each other.

While this is not, ostensibly, a romance (though there is an undercurrent of that throughout), I can't imagine a purveyor of same, be they novelist, scriptwriter, director, poet, whatever, who would not be able to draw endlessly on Mary and Max for inspiration and advice; this is a textbook on how to build flawed, relatable characters that audiences can easily identify with. The deepening friendship between the two, as well, is pitch-perfect as regards its pacing and the changing emotions between the two. Nothing about this feels staged or artificial, and while I know I have mentioned this already in the review, it bears repeating: the painstaking attention to building realistic characters and situations is underlined, triple and bold, in red, by this being claymation rather than live action. No wild flights of fantasy here; Elliot gives us a simple story, simply told, and he does it with such phenomenal empathy that it is impossible, at least I find it so, not to be as affected by this as anything else I have ever seen. Mary and Max is one of cinema's crowning achievements, as perfect and beautiful in its execution as Hotaru no Haka, and it deserves to be just as highly regarded.*****",1390003200,,2717,4.609504132231405
4074166,4,B00366E1E6,"I'd heard a couple of things here and there about this movie, and had it on my radar for some time, but always seemed to put it off. I finally sat down and gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. The animation is excellent in it's dreary and ugliness, which is important as the story trundles along. It's a slow, deliberate plot and it develops the two protagonists mostly through corresponding letters. The story is deep, and embraces the absurd and the almost disturbing behaviors that many of us have. It is not based on a true story, as the beginning would have you believe ( the director admitted that he got the idea from a normal relationship with a pen-pal he had as a child) but quite honestly, it doesn't make a difference to me. The honesty that this movie faces when confronting a person with Asperger syndrome (Max) as well as the childlike innocence Mary displays is brilliant, and by the end credits, you will feel that you know and care for them both.",1389744000,,962,4.410112359550562

I gave it five stars because it casts a unique light on how people with asperger's live, and how they interact with and cope with the world at large. In some ways it changed how I see aspergers as a ""disability"" and in other ways it confirms what I have heard from many aspies -- that it is not a disability so much as a different set of abilities. This movie will really make you think about what it means when we label people, whether we label them as disabled, normal, low functioning, unnatural, etc. What makes me normal? What makes you normal? Does my ADHD make me a disabled person? Does your OCD make you a disabled person? Or are we just differently abled? In this movie you will learn what it means to accept yourself as differently abled, as you watch Mary and Max work out what it means to be who they are.

4074183,5,B00366E1E6,"Though most cartoons are meant for younger viewers, Mary and Max most certainly is not. The seriousness of its topics like death, sex, suicide and mental illness definitely requires a more mature audience. But, trust me, as serious as it sounds, you don't wanna miss it! It's a simple story with a BIG message about the value and beauty of oddness and unconventional friendship. You don't quite know if you're watching a tragedy or a comedy and perhaps it's a mix of both. But ultimately, it doesn't matter. The point is to feel something and you feel a lot of everything when you're watching the life-long journey of these mismatched friends. The characters, Mary and Max, are like the Odd Couple meets Sigmund Freud.

Mary and Max is touching, poignant and funny in a very raw and immature sort of way. But what makes this little gem so fantastic is the juxtaposition of the artsy sophistication when contrasted against the emotional crudeness. For starters, the animation is impressive. The whole movie is desaturated, lacking vibrancy that cleverly mimics the vulnerability in both Mary and Max's lives. I'd venture to say that the animation rivals that of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas or, dare I say it, a Pixar flick.

I know! But seriously, it's an art form, one that Elliott's got down. It's pretty incredible.

Quirky, charming and eclectic. Those are just a few of the words I'd use to describe this film. Seriously, it's hard to do it justice with my meager words because I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. While I recognize this movie won't be everyone's cup of tea, Mary and Max is one of those hidden gems that you should give a chance. I promise, you won't regret it.

Food for Thought: Mary and Max is not your average cartoon. Raw, poignant, funny and charming, this Sundance Film Festival opener is a touching story about friendship, self-acceptance and love. This won't necessarily be everyone's cup of tea, but for an eclectic and appreciative few, this compelling little gem is a MUST SEE!",1388707200,,2043,4.811965811965812

The story is about a little girl from Australia who writes to a random older man in america asking questions she wants real answers about from what she has heard in Australia. Their conversation exchange is weird and contains inappropriate language. So this is not suitable for kids. I actually think it should be rated PG-13 in my opinion. They do show an image of this man she writes to on an island while in the nude yes with his you know what hanging out (It was displayed more on the simple shape side than detail really, but you get the main idea). I just personally did not like that. The movie was somewhat intriguing, but I chose it to watch while doing house work, which Im glad.

Bottom line, if you don't mind a full movie that is both narrated and has dialogue between the characters on odd topics, and are not uncomfortable with mental disorder then watch this.",1376524800,,480,4.5813953488372094

I agree with other reviewers who have noted that it's not quite accurate to call this a ""sunny"" film of any sort, but it need not be sunny to warm your heart. The characters are rich, the plot is satisfyingly paced, and there is a strong, thoughtful message about friendship here. What is more, and what I didn't really expect, there is a rather intelligent message about people with disabilities here as well. It's not the true focus of the film, and I'm glad that we're not hit over the head with it as we sometimes are, but the subtlety of the lesson is perhaps what makes it quite valuable. I recommend this film certainly, and I'm sure I'll return to it in the future.",1375920000,,706,4.396946564885496

I cried when Mary described her life. I just wanted to take her home and raise her myself. Her parent were too lost in their own miserable lives to notice how unhappy Mary was. At least she had Max to shine a little light in her life. And her husband Desmond, or whatever his name was, if he truly loved her, wouldn't he have helped her rather than leaving and moving to New Zealand? Overall, amazing movie and I find it somewhat realistic, well, I'm not so sure about the Asperger's Syndrome. I'm not familiar with it so I can't say whether or not it was accurately portrayed.

Now I've lost count how many times I've seen it. I absolutely love everything about it- the black & white (with splashes of red), the vocal performance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, the darkness, the quirkiness, the humor... but as others have said, it's not one for the kiddies. There's hardly any (if any at all) swearing, but you've got subject matter such as mental illness, bisexuality, alcoholism, a suicide attempt, death, and even some brief claymation nudity. But all these things are handled so tastefully I didn't find any of it offensive at all. The story and characters will draw you in and you'll feel all the emotions a good film should make you feel- you'll laugh, cry, sympathize, and find yourself rooting for the characters. Chances are, there's something in this film that you'll relate to on a personal level.

4074319,4,B00366E1E6,"""A lot of thoughts can be conjured up for a film of this calibre, not only is it a poetic, eccentric, and engaging stop-motion animated film from Australia but it is also a rather dark, moody, yet visually quirky one too. Mary and Max stands out in the league for just being uniquely different in its own right mostly for trying to take an original concept, having rather mature and daring elements like depression, loneliness, and alcoholism, and execute its offbeat rhythm to the beat of a comical drama in the form of letters-by-letters and narration for the whole film. Rarely does this occur in my film experience and given the unique story patterns and thematic edge, that is what makes the film surprisingly stand out even only seen it in two parts. Max Horowitz, excellently voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman, stands out a bit more given his wide array of issues/problems that he suffered and Max has a very Harvie Krumpet way about his behaviour that is perceivable in the appearance and crudity. The film does suffer from some thematic devices by skimming the surface and slightly rushing toward a good but abrupt ending. Life happens in flashes and at random but some focus toward a more solid conclusion could've worked and Mary's scenes of depression have a very disturbing nature about them that makes the film otherwise inappropriate for younger children as well as the suggestive humour and dark mature themes. The film is best recommended in the eyes of those who love animation as they'll have the opportunity to see a world in which is not entirely involved in mecha, talking animals, creepy crawlers, or franchises but something as human and dear to the complex soul as this little gem.""

CONTENT ADVISORY: While unrated, the film contains mature themes, disturbing situations, and suggestive humour that parents may find inappropriate for younger audiences. The film is likely to be a PG-13 equivalent.",1359072000,,1922,4.932098765432099

I enjoyed the many meaningful messages presented throughout the movie. There are many great quotes and provides a different view of how life can be perceived and how life is changing. At most, I would say this movie provides a wonderful message about friendship. A genuine friendship that is rare today. You can do many fancy things to prove you are ""best friends,"" but does your friendship provide you a sense of hope and inspiration? ""You are my best friend. You are my only friend.""

From the music to the coloring to the voices used, I adored this movie. Mary's earnestness and broken home parallels that of Max, who is lonely and a bit OCD. His childlike approach to situations make him an ideal pen pal for Mary, and they share tips on how to deal with bullies or how to control excessive eating.

The movie spans years and has its share of heartaches and laughter (look for young Mary's musing about her neighbor). I ended up watching it several times because it's such a cute movie.

4074355,1,B00366E1E6,"I was looking for a film my 8-year old child with Asperger's might relate to.  Thank goodness I watched it first!

All I can guess is that they tried to appeal to adults with a dark sense of humor.  There's nudity, multiple conversations about sex, numerous complete mental break-downs...  I wasn't sure whether I should be laughing or crying... usually I was just staring blankly at the screen.

The concept was great.  A young lonely girl with neurotic neglectful borderline-abusive parents reaches out to a random stranger through mail and finds an outlet to ask her questions and share her innermost thoughts.  Said outlet is an adult man with Asperger's who is completely unable to live in the world (an unfair depiction of most Aspies).  His main problem was anxiety- not Asperger's.

Like Charlie Brown, every time life starts looking up, it falls apart and the main characters fall ever harder and lower, until they are completely consumed by their misery.  They try to salvage the ending with the hope of new life (a baby- not with each other, because by then he's dead and she's divorced from her childhood sweetheart) filling the void of personal despair.  Any parent knows that simply having a baby, not matter how precious, will not fix your personal problems.  Maybe the baby symbolizes a fresh start.  Either way, the entire film is rather morbid.

I just don't see what the main point of the film was.  To raise awareness about mental disease?  To be more aware of other people and not treat them like freaks so they don't have nervous break-downs?  Some people just shouldn't reproduce..?

I have to give the animator's props, though.  For an independent film, it was well-made.",1339545600,15,1695,4.843205574912892

I always felt animation in all its forms has much to offer to movies in every genre but is mostly used for children's movies.

This movie breaks the mold. It is such a unique story and tells it in a way that has you engaged. Yes it is a sad story but how can someone give it a bad rating for being a movie with real emotion. I recommend anyone that likes any genre of movies to watch Mary and Max you will be pleasantly surprised that a claymation movie can convey a wide range of emotions and is not just for children.",1338854400,,817,4.138364779874214
4074357,5,B00366E1E6,"Mary & Max took me completely by surprise. Given the aesthetic of the film and the comical tone, I was prepared for another quant little claymation film. The story revolves around two adorably sculpted characters that resemble Don Martin drawings: Mary Daisy Dinkle from Australia and Max Jerry Horowitz from New York.

Mary, a child from Australia lives in a world dominated by browns. Her mother drinks, shop lifts, and accuses Mary of getting fat. Her father works in a factory and spends his spare time stuffing animals in the shed. Mary's parents provide her young mind with few answers to her questions about life so, in a moment of inspiration, she picks a name out of an American phone book and writes the name a letter.

Her letter finds Max. Max lives in a one bedroom apartment in New York. Mary's brown letter is an invasion of color in Max's otherwise black and white life. He suffers from asperger syndrome (calling himself an aspy) and regularly has panic attacks when he receives letters from Mary. When Mary asks him about love it bring on an attack so serious he is briefly institutionalized and subjected to shock treatments. Mary and Max become dependent on each other through a series of gifts and funny letters.

As the story progresses we start to sense a deep reservoir of feeling hiding behind the movies whimsical tone. Details about their family history that were so casually tossed out between jokes become deep scars that surgery can't remove (the way in one scene Mary removes her birthmark.) It's hard to say much more about the movie without giving away some of the surprise the movie brought me.

This kind of immersion wouldn't have been possible if the details of the movie hadn't been so expertly assembled. Toni Collette and Phillip Seymour Hoffman provide Mary and Max's voice and are pitch perfect. Hoffman is particularly good as the lonely Horowitz and it wasn't until the end of the movie that I even realized that it was his voice. Mary's Australia and Max's New York are very well visualized as well. When Max walks into his building and climbs into the elevator I was reminded of the Coen Brother's hotel in Barton Fink.

One of the differences between a good movie and great one is I will return to a great movie's characters in my mind days after I've watched the film. It's been a week now since I saw Mary and Max and I can honestly say that I've thought about it at some point each of the last seven days. Here is an animated movie that doesn't pander to any particular audience or age group. It doesn't dumb itself down. Instead it tells a story about two people that is whimsical, funny, lonely, sad, and intensely human.",1335744000,,2673,4.654661016949152

Her father does NOT work in a matchstick factory, but in a teabag factory, putting the strings on the bags.  Her grandfather most definitely did NOT commit suicide.  He dies of pneumonia and the little girl wonders how someone could die of ammonia.  And, while Max does have Asperger's Syndrome, he is definitely not agoraphobic.  Mary's across the street neighbor is the agoraphobe.

That said, this movie is funny, touching and heartbreaking.  One of the best I've seen in a long while.  And, while I'm not a claymation fan, the medium is well suited to the plot.",1332288000,,839,4.770833333333333

Mary Daisy Dinkle is an optimistic 8 year old living in Australia. Mary's mother's favorite things in life are her ciggys, shoplifting, sherry and telling her daughter that she was a mistake. Her father has the most comically dull job on Earth and spends his free time, not with Mary but in a backyard shed drinking Bailey's Irish Cream and stuffing road kill.

Through all this Mary still tries to smile and seeks answers to questions that all children have that she can't get answered. In her desire for a friend she picks at random a listing from a New York phone book and decides to write to this stranger hoping to have a pen pal.

She chooses Max Jerry Horowitz, mid forties Jewish atheist, who contends with Asperger Syndrome.  Max, who also has no friends is taken aback by this but writes back to Mary starting a 22 year relationship.

The film is very funny, very dark but shows how these two cope with life, each other and a world that neither can really grasp. Mary's enthusiasm is a pure delight to watch and despite suffering with mental illness, Max is very very wise in his observations and insights.

This is NOT a film for children in any way shape or form, so parents PLEASE screen this then make up your minds of how suitable it is for younger viewers. This is not Wallace & Grommit by any stretch of the imagination. It is a beautiful, powerful, touching and funny story that is brilliantly written and breathtakingly shot.

This story of the pen pal relationship between an unprepossessing eight year old from Australia, friendless, isolated and neglected by her parents, and a 44 year old, obese, friendless, Jewish man with Asperger's Syndrome is one of the most affecting movies I've ever seen.

It touches on all kinds of dark emotions and situations; alcoholism, loneliness, depression, feelings of low-self esteem, awkwardness, abandonment, suicide, obesity, bullying, rejection, disability. And yet it also manages to be very funny. The main characters, Mary and Max, are both sympathetic and endearing, despite their eccentricities and lack of social skills. Both are what you might call physically unattractive and yet they are oddly appealing. They make the viewer want to be their friend.

Of course, the claymation animation is excellent. The vocal characterizations are spot on. Philip Seymour Hoffman stands out in particular; I would have never known he was the voice of Max. Usually when a celebrity does a voice in an animated film they are instantly recognizable, but Hoffman BECOMES Max.

This movie touched my heart (it's very rare that a movie can do that for me) and I think it did the same for a lot of other people. See it!",1315180800,,1434,5.037974683544304
4074378,5,B00366E1E6,"I was fortunate enough to catch two screenings of Mary and Max in Singapore. As soon as I popped back to Australia, I picked up two copies of the DVD and one of the Blu-ray.

Although made on a small budget (compared to American claymation films/CGI animation) of AUD 6 million, there are plenty of sight gags to keep any audience amused. The story is brilliant in its simplicity (Mary picks a random name out of the US phone book, and it happens to be Max Horrowitz), and shines as we are shown more of Max's history, personality and eccentricities (apparently, being a member of a science fiction club wasn't enough to convince army recruiters to consider Max 'insane' enough to stay out of military service).

Phillip Seymour Hoffman shines as a middle-aged Jewish man with Asperger's. A very quiet man, he only speaks twice (in Yiddish). He is able to express himself very eloquently with nothing more than his typewriter (although he frequently suffers from a minuscule attention span).

Mary lives with her mother Vera (a kleptomaniac shoplifter), and a father who has one of the most boring jobs in the world (attaching strings to teabags... in a FACTORY!). Her neighbours include the school bully and the stuttering Damien. While the bully (quite likely a future criminal) is very simple and shallow, Damien and the Vietnam veteran turned amputee-agoraphobe certainly aren't.

The extras include a brief audition from Young Mary, and a director's commentary track (well worth listening to, and tons of fun). Eric Bana's mini-interview is very elucidating also. I was happy to learn that no minorities were offended (at least according to the commentary). For my part, I only take offense when people (usually religious apologists) trivialise and/or glorify suffering to further their goals of converting people.",1312934400,,1819,5.053333333333334

Max is a 44 year old man with Asperger's Syndrome, living in New York City.  Max is obese, addicted to chocolate hot dogs, without friends, and regularly institutionalized.

Could any two people be more different?  But the magic of this film is that these two become pen-pals, and they share their aspirations, their fears, their questions about life, and... various forms of chocolate.

4074393,5,B00366E1E6,"This self development review is on 'Mary and Max' - a 2009 film, written and directed by Academy Award-winning Australian director Adam Elliot. What is so unusual is that it is a clayography film, with all 200 sets, 212 puppets and 2,000 props being handmade from clay polymers, clays, plastics and metals.

MARY AND MAX - THE STORY

The actual story is about two lonely characters - Mary and Max. The characters are beautifully crafted, both physically and metaphorically. Mary is eight years old and lives in Australia. She has no friends, her mother is an alcoholic and a kleptomaniac, and her father is never there for her. The story begins with her wondering where babies come from in other countries as she has been told that, in Australia, they are found in the bottom of beer glasses.

To find out once and for all, she decides to ask someone in the USA by picking their name and address randomly from an American phone book. The lucky chap is Max who turns out to be Russian-Jewish with Asperger syndrome, in his 40s, depressed, neurotic, over-weight and is not able to handle everyday life and society in general.

They start to write to each other and exchange letters, postcards and packages over two decades - from the 1970s to the 1990s. The two lonely souls find `true friendship' in each other.

MARY AND MAX - THE EMOTIONS

It is a very moving film and you will experience many different emotions. Even though the characters are simply clay, you really feel for them. They make you laugh, cry and above all, think!

A huge number of subjects is covered including - in alphabetical order - agoraphobia, alcoholism, anxiety, Asperger syndrome, autism, being overweight, bullying, confidence, depression, friendship, kleptomania, loneliness, mental health, neglect, personal misfortune, phobias, poverty, relationships, self confidence, self esteem, suicide, tragedy and true friendship.

Many of these are pretty heavy subjects but they are treated with great empathy and sensitivity. In the past I have worked with children and adults with autism, Asperger syndrome, etc., and feel that the austistic traits were portrayed very intelligently.

MARY AND MAX - THE SELF DEVELOPMENT

My particular interest in this film was from a self development point of view. This is the story of two people, from completely different points on the globe, who are brought together in time. This connection allows them to self develop in a way that they could never have done without the other. The film is about two people trying to figure out who they really are, what life is really about and learning about their own self development through each other over a 20 year period.

MARY AND MAX - THE DETAIL

This is a film you actually need to watch twice in order to see all the bits you missed the first time round. So much happens in the background and with all the other creations in the numerous sets. There is also a lot of fascinating information related to the film such as  ""12 litres of water-based sex lube being used to create everything from tears to a surging jungle river.""  The detail of the clay animation or claymation is quite incredible, with the 92-minute film taking nearly five years to make with six people producing just four seconds of film a day!

MARY AND MAX - THE SUSPENSE

The film keeps you in suspense throughout. The story grips you. Throughout, you wonder what on earth could happen next. As just a tiny example, to find a 'cure' for Max's problems Mary decides to study psychiatry, doing a PhD thesis on Asperger syndrome. The story then takes a totally expected turn. Like most of the film, just when you think you know where things are heading they go in a completely different direction.

Be warned that this is not really a children's film. Overall, it has a rather dark storyline with a fair amount of morbid or black humour. It is not a film to make you warm and happy inside. The content and themes can be disturbing, even for adults!

MARY AND MAX - SUMMARY

The smooth narration drew me into a story the likes of which I have never heard before.  The plot is summarized already, though I'd like to point out that there are inconsistencies in the summary, but nothing too bad.  I'd like to tell you how the movie made me feel.

First, it was hilarious.  There was a gentle observational humor that was even more poignant because the observers are so different from the average person.  The very serious topic of mental differences** was handled with delicacy, never overwhelming the viewer with pity for the subject, Max, while at the same time instilling an appreciation of how others can see life differently without being wrong.  I loved how Max was often presented as being the sanest person in a city of ""normal"" people.

Despite what the summary says about Max's counterpart, Mary, was not a ""goth"".  She was a lonely little girl whose physical differences, rather than mental ones, separated her from the rest of society.  In Max she found a compatriot; they enjoyed the same cartoons, they had both endured teasing as children, and both were baffled by human emotions and what to do with them.
Though the story takes a dark turn, the ending brings redemption and bittersweet closure to a tale that I recommend to everyone.

** Mary & Max made me want to strike ""mental illness/handicap/disability"" from my vocabulary.  So I am.",1303689600,10,1620,4.780575539568345

Mary's letters to Max usually end up in Max having a rather huge nervous reaction.

This is a very interesting and unique claymation movie. It's mature and sensitive and tells a tragic tale of friendship. It's not for young kids as Max's explanations of things to young Mary are frought with adult viewpoints; he has Aspergers and is not able to flower things up.

I enjoyed this movie but had not known it would be so sad. It is very sad but uplifting at the same time. I watched it on a cold rainy day which deemed it appropriate for this colorless, grey screened film that has only touches of color with things like Mary's alcoholic mother's bright red lips and a cheery red pom pom that Mary makes Max which he wears on his capped brain.

If you like claymation movies this one is tops. It's brilliant. On the same brilliant level it deals with depressing topics such as lonliness, Aspergers, being over-weight and being different than the rest of the world, alcoholism, and it has a message about how sometimes what you are looking for is right there and so much time is spent wanting and seeking perfection in life. This is a good movie but it's not a kids claymation event. It's a thoughtful romp in the lives of two different minded folks who are far less than perfect.",1301184000,3,1819,4.453453453453453

I was touched and moved by this story of a little girl from Australia sending letters to an old jewish man in New York.  Well, it made me cry and I like movies that have that effect on me.  A lot a people who have seen this movie found it very depressing.  It is true that some of the subjects that are treated can be heavy... however, there is some true beauty that emanes from this story.

So I finally got a blu-ray unit and bought this title in that format.  When I fist put the movie in the tray, the first thing that I saw were those ugly previews that looked pixelized as some videos you can see on YouTube.  I was kind of afraid that the main movie would have been treated that way.  Then I got to the menu, presed play and I saw again that magnificent movie in a way that it's supposed to be showned.  I like claymation animation a lot so for a fan like me, being able to see every details on the caracters, the set... wow!  What an amount of work!  It's so beautifull!  Then I sat and looked at those supplemental features... they are not like those lame documentaries that tell always the same thing!

This small and gentle film carries way more than I know how to say. A child accepts her parents' flaws, since she knows nothing else. A young woman takes charge of her life, best she can, and succeeds almost as much as reality does.

4074434,5,B00366E1E6,"My first impression on the 2008 animated movie ""Mary and Max"" was that the characters were very ugly.  I tend to prefer cute characters in animations.  But as the movie went on, I began to understand the wonderful message it attempts to convey.
The gist of the movie is about how mental disorder is misunderstood and mistreated by our society.  The protagonist in the movie is an eight-year-old girl named Mary.  Mary lives in a dysfunctional family in Australia.  She is nerdy and has an unusual mole on her forehead that kids at school like to tease her about.  Her ""ugliness"" makes her a loner and she is very sad about it.  One day, she has the idea of making a new friend by writing to a stranger overseas.  She especially wants to find out if babies come from beers like those in Australia in other parts of the world.  She ends up picking Max, a 40-year-old man with Asperger syndrome living in New York City.  They form a strong friendship as pen pals quickly.
Due to this friendship with someone with Asperger, Mary grows up becoming a psychiatrist.  Her PhD thesis on Asperger syndrome becomes a bestseller.  She then writes to Max enthusiastically about the method she develops that can ""cure his disease.""  Much to her surprise, Max doesn't take that well at all.  He hates people calling him abnormal.  To him, everyone else is abnormal too.  People do irrational things such as throwing trash onto the streets and cutting down trees to suffocate themselves.  Max stops writing to Mary.  Mary, as the result, develops severe depression.  At one point, she commits suicide only to be saved by her wheelchair-bounded neighbor who suffers from a phobia of leaving his home.  Incidentally, the bravery of her neighbor turns into a cure for his own phobia.
The movie is filled with characters struggling to reconcile with their own mental disorders.  As a previous sufferer of severe depression and also the father of a depressed teenager, I can totally identify with those struggles.  What I like the most about the movie is how accurate it portrays mentally challenged people from their own points of view.  As a society, we need to learn to see the world through their eyes and I think this movie does a good job inspiring us.  We need to accept them as merely different from us but not weird.  With compassion and understanding, I believe we can easily integrate them into our society.  It is only by doing so will they be comfortable enough to offer their best to our society.
I also want to point out that I finally recognized why the movie uses ugly looking characters.  Most people in our society are like me who despite things, either living or non-living, that are ugly.  We never took the time to look into their internal beauty.  Mary and Max are both wonderful people.  Mary has a kind heart and Max is both simple and complex at the same time.  So, I admit this is discrimination and I need to work on it.
Despite of the seriousness of the subject, the movie chooses to use a light-hearted means to deliver the message, which is a style I like.  Unfortunately, I wish the humors lasted longer instead of mere sprinkles here and there.  But that is just a minor defect.  All in all, I highly recommend the movie.",1285891200,4,3233,4.62390158172232

4074436,4,B00366E1E6,"Though the cover of the film clearly displays the clever mixture of humorous quirkiness and bleak melancholy, some may still mistake the presentation of claymation characters as pertaining to what is generally considered a ""kid's movie."" Mary and Max may share many elements with movies of this ilk - including poop jokes, pratfalls, and occasional childlike innocence - but it shares much more of a relation with the gloomy dramedies that have become popular in the last half-decade. Not that writer/director Adam Elliot - whose short film Harvie Krumpet won him an Oscar in 2004 - could be considered derivative. In fact, Mary and Max (and Harvie Krumpet - included as a special feature on this dvd) showcases Elliot's singular vision of childlike wonder clashing with the harsh realities of adulthood.

Through the course of the movie, we follow a young Australian girl (Mary - eventually voiced by Toni Collette, once she ages) as she sends and receives letters, postcards, and packages from the titular Max (expertly voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman), a depressed Jewish overeater with Asberger's Syndrome. The two characters, living as outcasts from the societies around them, manage to connect over the years as they discuss alcoholism, religion, and where babies come from. As the story progresses and Mary ages, she eventually marries and goes off to college, where she seeks a ""cure"" for Max's disorder. The relationship between Mary and Max is alternately commonplace and sublime as the two very different individuals react to the beliefs, troubles, and joys of each other's lives.

With striking visuals (there's also a nice ""Making Of"" and a ""Behind The Scenes"" featurette included on the dvd) and a moving story full of pathos, Mary and Max is a beautifully presented film that manages to touch on universal themes through the seemingly confined lens of a few odd characters. Though I have to admit that the ending is a bit disappointing, everything leading up to it is impeccable.",1283731200,3,1995,5.097859327217125
4074437,5,B00366E1E6,"Simply stated, ""Mary and Max"" is the perfect film.

I watch a lot of movies; on average, I watch at least one movie every other day. I see a lot of great films, which tend to be classics and creme of the crop films that appear on the critics' annual top ten lists. Inevitably,  I also see a lot of bad and mediocre movies.

What makes the experience of movie-watching rewarding for me, what I watch for is that effervescent feeling of being surprised and delighted with the storyline of the film so much so that one forgets one's own personal troubles and is literally transplanted into the world of cinema. Such an experience is rare for anyone, but especially for someone who watches movies with the purpose of then dissecting them and blogging about their shortfalls.

And yet, when one does come across a gem, a film with integrity, values, and, most importantly, heart, one can not help but gush with admiration. ""Mary and Max"" is the kind of film that stops a person in their tracks and makes them appreciate life. It's the kind of movie that warms the iciest of souls. To borrow from the film itself, ""Mary and Max"" is the kind of movie that  ""makes your brain smile.""

Indeed, the film is intelligent mentally and emotionally. Without spoiling the plot, I will say that the friendship, companionship, and love that's shared by the title characters transcends beyond what a moviegoer generally sees and experiences at the theater.

How marvelous is ""Mary and Max""? It's been about 30 minutes since I've seen it and I'm itching to watch it again. I have a feeling that it's the kind of film that stands up to repeated viewing and one that truly benefits from them as the jokes and animation deserve more reflection and observation.

""Mary and Max"" is the kind of film that makes you think. The kind of movie that makes you cry. The kind of film that makes you laugh. The kind of film that makes me happy to be alive. The kind of movie that restores your belief in humanity.

In addition to the skillful stop-motion animation and an impeccable plot, it doesn't hurt that two of the hardest working, most talented actors today have lend their voices for the title characters. Mary is voiced by Toni Colette; whereas Phillip Seymour Hoffman lends his voice for Max.

The truth of the matter is that no amount of praise can define the experience of watching the latest stop-motion claymation animated feature. Drop everything and watch it and discover the perfection for yourself.",1283212800,6,2482,4.65903890160183
4074438,5,B00366E1E6,"Technology is constantly fluctuating. Even other day you can get a new phone thatfll do at least one more thing than the last one: voice dialing, HD video recording, bar-code reading, GPS,  video chat, until eventually our phones will inhabit our bodies and force us into slavery. Wait, has Apple already done that?

  Another bit of technology that is constantly in flux is film. One day we have jerky, black-and-white, soundless frames available in 5x5 manually rotating film boxes, the next we have computer generated imagery of a cartoon wildebeest sharing a screen with the since deceased Rodney Dangerfield running us down in 3-D. Itfs been quite a century.

  In the midst of that timeline of film, there once was an stop-motion animated process called claymation. The use of claymation began before cell-structuring, and could be seen used in creations such as Bob the Builder, every worthwhile Christmas special ever made, TOOL videos, and uber-ridiculous video games. In keeping with the idea that art should be a pain-staking, bloody process that would take years to accomplish, claymation film made itself a true 3-D art form to be pitted against a more commercial, computer-generated 3-D world. Sadly, stop-motion in general lost steam as Tim Burton decided to put Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in as many live-action movies as possible. however, there was a minor resurgence in the art-form when Seth Green launched his infamous Robot Chicken. It is unknown how much an effect Robot Chicken had on writer/director Henry Selick, but some time later Coraline hit the public with tremendous success. Stop-motion animation was shot in 3-D, blending the old with the new with fantastic success.

  However, I havenft given a crap about the return of claymation for at least a decade, until I saw Mary & Max.

  The story that evolves in Mary & Max is almost like an adult fairytale, except that it is based in reality, and is supposedly even based on a true story. Itfs not exactly the content that makes it like a fairytale, but more how it is presented. For most of the film, the story is explained to us by a disembodied narrator(voiced by Barry Humphries) as if our grandfather were telling us about Mary & Max, after he had told us that babies came from beer glasses. This narration gives the story a quirky cuteness to it, since many times the action on the screen is almost the opposite of what the narrator is portraying, like how a child, or a middle-aged man with Aspergerfs Syndrome, would imagine it.

  The plot of Mary & Max is as follows: a lonely, chubby 8 year old Australian with a Gorbachev birthmark named Mary Daisy Dinkle randomly chooses an address from New York to start writing to in the hopes that they would answer a question about where babies come from in America. The letter is received by Max Jerry Horowitz(played by Philip Seymour Hoffman), an obese, 44 year old Jewish atheist living in New York with Aspergerfs Syndrome. Maryfs simple letter is answered with a novel of a letter where Max divulges information I wouldnft put in a diary that I locked away in a safety deposit box on the moon. He also tells her that in America, babies come from eggs laid by rabbis, Catholic nuns, and dirty prostitutes. This begins an inter-continental friendship that lasts for about 18 years, that is followed throughout the movie.

  The comedy comes from the sincerity of Mary and Max as they try to explain their lives to each other in their socially inept voices: Mary being inexperienced with life, and Max being utterly oblivious at times. A little girlfs obsession with Earl Grey, a manfs obsession with chocolate hotdogs, a closeted Greek boy with an obsession with sheep herders(played by Eric Bana), even suicide, these ideas are all incorporated into almost a sing-song quality. This does not diminish the emotions involved to the viewer when watching the film, but it does dull the sharpness a bit. The story isnft without grieving moments, which makes it more like the adult fairytale description that I just canft shake from. Oh, and I got a little misty-eyed at the end. Like when I watched What Dreams May Come and Big Fish. Wimp, you say? I dare you to get through any of these 3 movies without some tears, you cold-hearted [...].

  The production of the film is fantastic. During the opening credits, the camera work makes it a point to show the detail and texture that had gone into creating the settings and characters, from lamp posts to pets. They look almost animated, which is a testament to not only the clay artisans, but the cinematography as well. The detail is what makes this movie stand out most of all, and reclaim the idea of claymation as an art-form, and not some ridiculously low-budget production style.

  In regards to flaws, I couldnft find any. The only thing I could call a flaw is that the packaging as an animated movie, and the gNot Ratedh rating, could result in an oblivious parent picking out the movie for their child. There are few moments that could be construed as explicit, but as a whole, the movie is a little too deep and the subject matter a bit more adult orientated. This is from a guy who turned his younger siblings on to horror movies.

  I give this film 5 out of 5 chocolate hotdogs. Get the Blu-Ray version if you have the chance, and the extra 5 bucks.",1283126400,2,5355,4.741379310344827
4074439,3,B00366E1E6,"If Tim Burton and Sigmund Freud were to collaborate on a film, the result would be ""Mary and Max,"" a sometimes poignant but mainly depressing animated film.

Both find consolation in each other's letters, and their friendship somehow spans oceans, age, time, and the risk of death from obesity and diabetes (they're both fanatical chocolate lovers).

Mary is a little girl living in Australia, whose family life is wretched and unbearable (her mother is the world's first alcoholic kleptomaniac).  Max is a middle-aged New Yorker who has Asperger syndrome but rather just be called retarded.

I must admit that it was a compelling movie and my wife and I did manage to watch (endure) the whole film.  The claymation and sets were fantastic, albeit dreary.  The story was essentially about a lonely, dysfunctional girl from Australia who finds a friend (pen pal) in New York, who is an elderly, depressed, Jewish man with Asperger's syndrome (and a host of other psychiatric illnesses).  What fun! The message of this film had to do with relationships, and in particular friendships, but many of the characters in the film lived a miserable life whose only salvation was death.  In fact, it's OK to kill yourself if you are old, lonely and have a goiter on your neck.  We found this movie to be disturbing at worse, and depressing at best.  There was sick humor scattered throughout the film which was mildly entertaining at times, especially when the mime got killed.  This was a great film for the study of psychology and psychiatry as it was filled with miserable and/or dysfunctional characters.  But much of the humor was at their expense.  I wanted to like this film, but alas, it left me feeling a bit depressed.  This is really NOT a ""feel good"" movie as far as I'm concerned.

4074456,2,B00366E1E6,"Hate to be the down vote here, but I found this one of the most ""less than the sum of its parts"" films I've ever watched. Everything about it was excellent, except the film itself. The acting was splendid--I'm not sure I've ever felt an actor dissolve into an animated creature as well as happened here. The sets were incredible; Central Park was just stupendous. The two-tone photography was a brilliant touch. Yep, many, many special things.

But I disliked it a lot. I could write about many of the reasons, but the film's animosity (and it is clearly animosity) toward the handicapped and toward religion are despicable. I am quite aware we were supposed to see the ""retard"" headlines as manifestations of the world's ignorance and malice, but I cannot help but feel that there is a definite level of condescension toward Max in the film as well. He is designed to be laughed at; his foibles and peculiarities are all-too-real, but also the butt of many jokes. Max is a confused and helpless guy, incapable of handling the many challenges that come from a lonely life in a big city, and much of the humor is of the ""fish out of water"" variety. But I felt quite sorry for him. It is certainly funny when Charlie Chaplin slips on a banana peel, but far less so if a blind man on crutches takes the same fall. That's not comic. That's cruel.

I'm not sure how strong a case you're making against religion by having someone as disoriented and generally baffled as Max as your spokesman, but the lines about the foolishness and childishness of religion were pointless, unnecessary, and diminished the tale. I know it is de rigueur for every film to take a swipe at God, no matter how inappropriate it is, but I was just irritated by this. Added nothing, took away a lot. God, on the other hand, can handle this petty snideness just fine. In fact, the theme of this film, that forgiveness has to be humbly offered, and accepted with equal humility, because fallible creatures will inevitably wound each other, is one I've read about in a religious text or two. Powerful stuff, that.

And, the gratuitous and cheesy sex jokes and naked bodies were not just unfunny, they were creepy. I guess this was to appeal to ""grown-ups"", but they certainly did not appeal to me. Maybe I'm just not grown up enough......

So it got all the peripherals right, but missed mightily on the big things. And created a movie whose audience I have a hard time imagining. Not kids, that's for sure. Not me or my world. I guess it is for smarmy, smart-mouthed, self-indulgent and self-absorbed young people who know better than everyone else the pointlessness of contemporary life, the idiocy of religious belief, and the hollowness of most family relationships. If that's you, well enjoy, at least as much as you can enjoy anything! If not, I think you'll feel as I do.",1278028800,20,2845,4.627722772277227
4074457,5,B00366E1E6,"It is beyond me why this title is so obscure. None of the stores in my town are carrying it, and here on Amazon it has only 8 reviews. But it is the best animated feature I have seen in years. In fact, I cannot think of a better one. It is elaborate and beautiful as a Tim Burton film, but has more subtlety and more heart. I think that the big media companies don't know what to do with a film like this. It isn't really appropriate for children. It is too intelligent for the average American who is more accustomed to the shallow and flashy garbage which tv and Hollywood have innundated us with. It is too bleak and dark for a culture which insists that its darkness be leavened with positive messages and happy endings. (It does, in fact, have such a message but rather overwhelmed by all the mental illness, alienation and death.) This film does, however, have an audience and when they stumble across it they will treasure it, and this film won't be forgotten. I wouldn't be surprised, in 10 years, to see a company like Kino or Criterion releasing it, to great acclaim, as an obscure classic.",1277164800,11,1100,4.397058823529412
4074458,5,B00366E1E6,"""Mary and Max"" is a claymation feature film written and directed by Adam Elliot that was an Official Selection of the Sundance Film Festival. It tells the story of two lives that change forever after Mary who lives in Melbourne, Australia chooses at random an American name out of a Manhatten address book as a pen pal and enters into an unlikely friendship with Max that turns out to span twenty years.

Unlike most claymation films, this is not a children's movie. It is more for a mature audience as over the course of the film the characters write about and deal with alcoholism, kleptomania, religion, depression, agoraphobia, and suicide.

Lonely eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle voiced by Bethany Whitmore only finds joy in watching her favorite television show, ""The Noblets"" while consuming sweetened condensed milk since her mother is an alcoholic and cannot stop ""borrowing"" items from the store by stuffing them under her dress and her father hides in a room alone all day drinking Irish Cream. She has a birthmark she is embarrassed about and has trouble making friends until the day she decides to find out more about how life in America is different from her life in Australia. Little did she know she would select someone who needed a friend just as badly as she did.

Forty-four-year-old Max Jerry Horovitz voiced by Philip Seymore Hoffman attends Overeaters Anonymous and suffers from Asperger's syndrome that keeps his estranged from others and obsessed with the problem of littering. The strangeness of this new interaction with someone by letter causes him great anxiety due to his condition, but the writing helps him come out of his shell slowly and open up to Mary. By confessing their hopes and dreams and worries to each other, they both move closer to living full-color lives.

At times their relationship is estranged due to Mary's growing up, falling in love, and studying psychology to learn more about Max. When Mary grows up, she is voiced by Toni Collette and her romantic interest, Damien is voiced by Eric Bana. The back and forth of their friendship and the trials they both face in their lives are saddening and sobering. They both deal with very serious issues in a slightly humorous way due to the style of claymation. This is a unique film, it's no family-fun Pixar or Dreamworks because even though it has so much funny letter-writing, the story itself is very sad and deals with really serious mental and psychological problems people have. Wait for your children to reach a mature age before sharing this film with them.

Bonus Features:

There is a making of featurette composed of a series of odd scenes pieced together of the director arriving on a segway and riding the length of the studio to one person destroying a miniature set with a big mallot to a short interview with Eric Bana about how short his part was to someone receiving a ticket from a cop. It is very random and has little to do with the making of this film. The behind the scenes featurette shows the scale of the Manhatten set and close-ups of the puppets and how they function together. It is very interesting to see the challenges of this type of film.

The alternate scenes reveal considerably less desirable versions of two of the closing scenes. One so horrific that it is shocking that it was made. There is a casting call showcasing the little girl who plays young Mary, Bethanie Whitmore reading her audition sides. There is an Academy Award-winning short film also written and directed by Adam Elliot in 2003 called ""Harvie Krumpet"" that is narrated by Geoffrey Rush. It is another claymation film serious in subject matter but written and animated in a humerous way to detail one man's life filled with challenges and hardships that inspired ""Mary and Max"".

The commentary with Adam Elliot reveals that this entire film was shot ""in camera"" meaning nothing digital was added later and everything shot was handmade. There are about 200 characters, 200 sets, and approximately 2,000 props all made by hand. Elliot is a wealth of information about how all these elements come together to make such a complex, detailed film and is one of the more fascinating commentaries I've heard.",1277078400,2,4206,4.840055632823366
4074459,5,B00366E1E6,"Although the product description doesn't say, this DVD also includes the superb short ""Harvie Krumpet,"" so it is not necessary to purchase that DVD separately. In fact, it is probably another reason to get this amazing movie.",1276819200,7,225,5.108108108108108

4074461,5,B00366E1E6,"Hands down THE animated film of 2009 - that wowed me on so many levels.  Why this wasn't nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.  While it's not for children under the age of 13 - it deals with alot of 'adult' themes - the story, animation style, the voice work is all perfect.  I won't give the ending away, but the emotion the film left me, hasn't elicited such a tremendous emotion from an animated film in a very LONG time. Highly recommended.",1276387200,4,444,4.261904761904762
