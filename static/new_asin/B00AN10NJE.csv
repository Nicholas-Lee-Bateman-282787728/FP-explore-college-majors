5457765,4,B00AN10NJE,"I saw Falls the Shadow at a limited release showing a few months ago in Nashville.

Overall- I was impressed- especially when I heard it was the director's first feature length film.

I really enjoyed the characters, story and beautiful shots. I'm not a huge post-apocalyptic movie fan, but I thought the film gave an interesting look in to what could happen to America if there were some kind of cataclysmic disaster.... with a few zombies thrown in here and there just for fun. ;)

I thought it was really interesting how they explored the struggle between darkness and light in the film- on an individual, community and situational basis. And, of course, the fight scenes were pretty awesome too.

I thought the sound- at least in the version that I saw- was a little weak. Sometimes it didn't seem very balanced.

Over all, very good film- and DEFINITELY better than the cover art would lead you to believe. If you're on the fence, and looking for a film with some substance... and zombies, give it a chance.

It's not your run-of-the-mill zombie flick, that's for sure!",1361318400,4,1074,4.716577540106952

5457767,2,B00AN10NJE,"So the Storyline is pretty good, but the acting continually drags it down. The lines are cheesey and the story doesn't focus on Zombies, but rather the racist Nazi redneck that are being criminals. How is the Zombie story not enough? Sure its been done a lot of times, but its only been done correctly about 4 times. watch at your own risk.",1374624000,2,340,4.412698412698413

5457770,2,B00AN10NJE,Based upon the reviews I was expecting at least a decent zombie flick. I think I counted 3 zombies in the entire movie. The rest of the movie was about rednecks being mean to other rednecks. It was like The Hills Have Eyes meets Gone with the wind. I just didn't get it.,1370044800,12,270,4.113207547169812

5457773,4,B00AN10NJE,"T. S. Eliot writes, ""Between the idea and the reality-- Between the motion and the act-- Falls the Shadow."" Philosophically this film echoes Eliot's existential musings-- focusing intently on what it is about human nature that truly defines humanity-- all through the lens of a post-apocalyptic world. This film is incredibly rich in symbolism and metaphor. It's something I'd definitely like to see Slavoj Zizek dissect!",1362355200,4,421,5.393939393939394

Amazing talent for this young director in his debut film.
Not just a Zombie film.
Highly recommended!",1362268800,5,134,5.428571428571429
5457775,5,B00AN10NJE,"For those who enjoy zombie action with a bit more -- this surprising debut feature has a LOT more, with insightful plot structure and great characters to elevate the film to a legitimate cinematic status.  Loved the ominous packaging, too, although most of the story takes place during a tentative reconstruction period, so-to-speak, following a virtual zombie apocalypse. Definitely worth watching.",1362182400,3,399,5.540983606557377

8554446,1,B00AN10NJE,"I rarely write reviews here on Amazon, but after watching this movie I am compelled to. Anyone who rates this movie 4 or 5 stars must have worked for the production, or must parent one who worked for this production. Moms stop fooling your kids, they're not wonderful at everything they do.

Now I love independent zombie movies. I enjoyed Juan of the Dead, Deadheads, The Dead, A Little Bit Dead, and Exit Humanity.

Zombie Wars: Falls the Shadow (a title that is never explained), is a film about several groups in the zombie apocalypse: a mother and son looking to survive, a man and his father and law looking for revenge against a confederate/nazi group, a cowboy and a woman he met moving west. None of this is original, and that's fine.

The problem is no one could ACT.  I mean no one. The problem is the SCRIPT was terrible, even absent in some areas. You see characters just sitting around not saying anything for minutes at a time! Have you ever met anyone who tacked on your name at the end of every sentence? Kind of annoying, weird, and unnatural, right? Well, the woman with the cowboy guy, tacked ""cowboy"" at the end of every sentence.

If anyone is writing a review telling you they were taken away by the story or the actors they are LYING. They had fun watching their friends make a movie with a handheld camera.",1381449600,6,1331,4.483471074380165
8554447,1,B00AN10NJE,"The aesthetic and narrative standards for zombie films are historically, to say the least, notoriously low. In fact, the genre thrives on zombie films which seem to _deliberately_ aim low, which seem to please viewers all the more. Further, to say that one is 'disappointed' with a zombie film would raise serious questions about the speaker's understanding of the parameters of the genre: how can one be 'disappointed' with a genre which has no aesthetic standards, and whose primary actors simply slump around covered with red paint, panting and growling? Yet, fantastic as it may seem, this film manages to disappoint. In the history of zombie films, 'Zombie Warz' is the Waterloo, the Battle of Wounded Knee, the Gettysburg: it is the historical point where the genre dips onto the zone of complete cultural irrelevance, and becomes offensive, not to good taste, but to bad. The makers of this film owe a wholehearted apology to Western culture. To say anything more about the film would inappropriately dignify it with the appearance of relevance. Please, for the love of God, do not purchase this film, do not watch this film, do not ever repeat in public that this film exists, and perhaps Western civilization may stumble along, panting and moaning, for a few more years.",1376870400,7,1279,4.981308411214953
8554448,1,B00AN10NJE,"Zombie Warz ""Falls the Shadow""
Zombie Warz ??? Really? Shouldn't there be lots of zombies in a zombie war movie?

The ""Z"" in the title is a cheap attempt to associate this movie to the recent, more successful, World War Z .

There were very few ""zombies"" in the whole movie. Mostly evil nazi's. Lots of so-so actors.

The only ""war"" is between the radical nazi group, led by a whacko preacher (that hates anyone who is not white), and pretty much everyone else (including the occasional zombie that wanders by)

The few zombies in this movie were more intelligent and calculating than most of the non-zombies....lol  The zombies think, run really fast and can sniff out humans.

If you are looking for a zombie killing action flick (like the title tries to imply)....this is certainly  NOT it.

I think there were far more ""black hating nazis"" killed in one Rambo style battle, than there were zombies in this whole ""war"" movie.

I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't.",1376524800,13,975,4.654970760233918
8554449,2,B00AN10NJE,"Three years after ""the war"" America is destroyed and there are zombies running around. These are not traditional head shot zombies, but are simply cannibalistic infected people. A group of xenophobic ""red necks"" lead by Josiah (Phil Perry) want to cleanse America and start breeding their own kind. They kidnap Cora (Annie Thurman) for the cause. Her father Mike (David Eby) and grandfather Frank (Ron Berryessa) seek the group out so they can rescue her. There is also a nice guy walking around named Noah (Luke Hatmaker) who adds a gf (Olivia Bishop) and there is a kid who has been bit that should figure into the main plot, but doesn't.

This film was originally released in 2011 under the title ""Falls the Shadow."" With the release of World War Z, they apparently added the ""Zombie Warz"" as a way to capitalize on the success of the blockbuster.

The film didn't have a lot of zombies and lacked special effects. It was shot on a budget. Writer/director Steven Berryessa apparently couldn't afford actors so he employed his family. Ron Berryessa, who had a speaking role, was noticeably  bad, but was clearly out shined by the ridiculous purse lipped David Eby. His bad acting approached MST comical.

Not worth the trip to Redbox.
