8037319,4,B00062IZ0E,"For those of you who will buy John Woo's ""Once A Thief"" DVD series/TV-movies, please take note:  I bought ""John Woo's Once a Thief - Brother Against Brother"" and ""John Woo's Once a Thief - Family Business."" The DVDs inside were switched!  In other words, the actual DVD DISC, though labeled ""Brother Against Brother,"" contained the movie ""Family Business."" And vice versa!
So I suggest that you buy ""Family Business"" and ""Brother Against Brother"" together, and just switch the DVDs inside.  (I just wrote on the DVD itself with a Sharpie to properly label the movie contained.)",1066867200,5,577,4.927835051546392
