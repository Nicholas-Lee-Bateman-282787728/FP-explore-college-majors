5408447,4,B00AB2NX1K,"After many years of watching this film on a VHS I recorded off Showtime, it's good to see it issued on DVD.

Robert Ryan as Donald Whitley Carson III, was known to venture off frequently to who knows where. Why he would leave gorgeous wife Geraldine (Rhonda Fleming) for any length of time is beyond me. Of course he was a spoiled alcoholic.

This time he, his wife and her secret lover Joseph Duncan take a trip to the desert, where Donald falls off his horse, breaks his leg and is left to die. Much of the film is devoted to desert scenery, Donald's clever ways to survive, and the ""search"" by Geraldine and Duncan.",1359331200,2,618,4.3652173913043475

5408450,5,B00AB2NX1K,"Finally,  20th Century Fox has released an official region 1 version of ""Inferno"".  And it is a very nice technicolor print, in it's original aspect ratio of 1.37: 1.  Others can debate as to whether or not a technicolor film can be a film noir, I'll just enjoy for what it is--a fairly straight forward story an unfaithful wife (Rhonda Fleming) and her lover (William Lundigan) trying to kill her wealthy, drunkard of a husband (Robert Ryan).  And as a bonus,  Rhonda Fleming looks gorgeous in technicolor.",1355788800,28,507,4.781609195402299
5408451,4,B00AB2NX1K,"It's a disadvantage in not seeing this film in it's original 3-D.
But even as a 2-D character thriller, it's pretty effective in a
B-movie way.

In its time, it wasn't seen as a B-movie, with the high end 3D process,
and being one of the first films in stereo. But seeing it as a B-movie
now gives a better feel for its strengths (which are considerable) and
forgiveness for it's weaknesses.

A man with a broken leg has been left to die out in the Mojave desert
by his wife and her younger lover. While this couple 's actions are
clearly unforgivable, the man they abandon isn't particularly
sympathetic himself. As played by Robert Ryan he's a wealthy, selfish
spoiled brat, used to having things on his terms, not caring much for
the feelings of others. I admired the film's bravery in having such a
hard to like anti-hero, and still succeeding in getting us caught up in
his struggle to survive. (If this were made today, Hollywood would
never dare have a survival film hero this dark).

It's sort of desert film noir - bright and colorful instead of black
and white and shadowy, but the feel is the same - a world of seedy
characters and moral quagmires.

On first viewing, while always interesting, it lacked those deeper
layers that make a classic noir. I enjoyed it, will re-watch it, but
never felt deeply involved emotionally and started to forget it fairly
quickly once it was done. Whereas, say, 'Double Indemnity', was
permanently stamped on my brain from a first viewing. So this might not
be a classic, but it's still well- worth catching.

This Spanish release is of quite good quality.  It was made by 20th Century
Fox in Spain, so it's not a ripped off version. Rumor has it that a long
overdue US release is finally in the works.",1329955200,27,1748,4.533333333333333

He's a tyrannical millionaire whose wife (Rhonda Fleming) and her boyfriend (William Lundigan) leave him to die in the desert when he breaks his leg. Our sympathy shifts in his favor as he gathers resolve and fights to survive. One reason the picture is little-known today may be that it was originally filmed and shown on the 3-D process that was all the rage for a little while in the early 50s. People who didn't like the gimmick stayed away from most 3-D pictures. You can tell one of thesse things in flat-screen versions because stuff is always flying at the camera.",1431302400,,638,4.654867256637168

5408461,5,B00AB2NX1K,"I'm not even sure why I like this so much, I know the first time I ever saw it was late at night on TV and it just drew me in. I would watch it every time it showed up and even the remake (called Ordeal, a TV movie) was good. The plot has Robert Ryan as a nasty millionaire who breaks his leg while scoping out the desert. His wife and guide leave to get help but decide to just abandon him so he'll die and she can get his money. Only he doesn't die. After he figures out that they are not coming back (and he's wasted a lot of his resources by being his selfish self) he gets determined to make it out and take his revenge. The movie is all about how he survives in the desert with a broken leg and almost nothing else. I got the impression that the determination that drove him to become a millionaire is what allows him to survive in this environment and he becomes a better man for it. The wife and guide return to make the 'discovery' of his dead body, but there is none, so they start to track him. A very engrossing film.",1413590400,7,1029,3.975845410628019

5408463,5,B00AB2NX1K,"This is why you need a multi region 3D blu ray player!!! This movie is one of the finest 3D restorations I have ever seen. It looks better than House Of Wax. The story is very good and everyone in this movie does a great job in creating a film noir atmosphere. The 3 main characters are not nice people, very shady, and self centered. The 3D is flawless and the desert scenario is perfect and  shows well in Technicolor! Rhonda Fleming (need I say more) is drop dead fine and very bad! Robert Ryan is excellent as the anti-hero victim and William Lundigan is perfect as her killer boyfriend!

5408466,5,B00AB2NX1K,"I saw this over 40 years ago on a ""Dialing For Dollars"" afternoon telecast on TV and couldn't wait to see a better treatment of this partially-narrated drama. This version has a much crisper visually enjoyable picture suggesting in a couple scenes its former 3-D theater showing nationwide. From ""The Set-Up,"" an early 50s under-rated film by Robert Wise, Robert Ryan has always been a watchable star. This technicolor version retains the entire film (including Intermission notice) allowing you to take in the dramatic photographic touches that dramatize the perilous predicament of Ryan, abandoned by his wife(Rhonda Fleming) and her scheming lover, William Lundigan. Injured, alone on a mountain ridge, what can a not-so self-made millionaire (Ryan) do? There are numerous switch-back shots that dramatize the situation, one cut-back to the lovers swimming while Ryan thirsts. And, like other noir films, it can be the small details that undo things, like the underestimation of the scientific mind of this gnarly, absorbed-in-his-work neglectful millionaire. What is fascinating today is the true make-up of such a mostly-inherited millionaire like Ryan (or Howard Hughes) is that they do realize their life's work is to work to deserve what was given them. So, it makes perfect sense that Ryan would not unravel under pressure. So, the script is realistic once Ryan's narration begins in slowly bringing out a latent competency. As an audience you have little regard for the conspirators but your regard for Ryan climbs as he descends to solid ground. There is a climactic fight at the end that doubly brings home the title of the film with one of the best face-offs with a murderess you will see, when Ryan stops his car for his soon ex-wife (Fleming) and asks her, ""You want to get in the car or wait for the sheriff to come for you?"" Her look is worth a million. Which is why with 2 re-makes since, you will go back to this keeper. Ryan earned his respect, while the others squandered theirs.",1411084800,,2000,4.973134328358209
5408467,5,B00AB2NX1K,"This is a fantastic  3d blu ray. Paramint did a outstanding job on this one. It looks stunning and cleaned up mostly.  This was filmed in 3d and it really shows here. The blu ray comes with a nice booklet as well.  The story is a good one and Robert Ryan and Ms. Fleming were A list actors at the time this was filmed.  This is very true in format as well. Which is always a good thing.  Hopefully paramint can grab more 3d titles.  Sadly this is only region b or Europe in format. However if you buy a allregion 3d blu ray player , which also plays blu rays and dvd's from everywhere in the world then you can watch this on your tv.  Check amazon.com for a all region 3d blu ray player.  This is a great action flick and many consider it the best 3d film of the 50's.  Several other vintage 3d titles will be out soon here in the states.  ""dragonfly squadron' and ' the bubble' and wb is doing 'kiss me kate'  next year. 3d is a great format and this one won't let you down.

5408468,3,B00AB2NX1K,"I may be flamed for my reason for not giving five stars, but se le vie. This is one of my old favourite movies, but I cannot watch this copy. It has no subtitles, and I cannot hear the dialogue. I was extremely disappointed. Issued by the original studio that produced the film, I expected a very fine copy. I can't speak to that because as soon as we started watching we realised that it would not work for me. (The ""we"" includes my wife, who does not enjoy watching movies without subtitles because she like us to enjoy them together.)

Flame me to your heart's content--it will roll off my back. If a major studio can thoughtlessly release a film that cannot be enjoyed by the zillions who cannot hear, then perhaps it should receive one star. I'm being generous, with three. I cannot judge the quality of the video, but I hope it, at least, is great, even if the dialogue is garbled. The movie itself is one of the great ones. Different, well-acted, and captivating. Try it, but not if you can't hear well.  (Don't preach to me about blue-tooth and ear-phones--they don't hack it. My hearing aids, several brands, cost $5-7,000 a pair; they help me get along, but not in most situations, including watching movies.)

Incidentally, I had been looking for many years for Inferno, and The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker, to appear. I bought each, and am really disappointed that these Fox archive movies are being released this way. There are many I'd order if I could experience the dialogue. So from my view point, three stars is generous for a product that is intentionally sold without the possibility of many to use it. Sad.",1408924800,,1626,4.6

5408474,5,B00AB2NX1K,"This was a great movie I discovered in a catalogue.  Robert Ryan has long been one of my favorite actors:  a tough guy who usually underacts a bit.  Inferno is a captivating story that grips your attention and keeps you wondering what is coming next.
I loved the survival aspects of the film, as the pampered rich guy learns to take care of himself and how to live in the hostile desert environment in which he finds himself trapped.
William Lundigen is great as the villain, with Henry Hull(?) as the kindly, wise old prospector.
The story has a few surprises, and the ending is dramatic.  Well worth the price!
This film has been overlooked too long!  Hopefully, critics will rediscover it soon and promote it to its rightful place.",1395273600,7,734,4.615384615384615

It's a stunning film shot by Lucien Ballard who also lensed ""The Wild Bunch"" another film that Ryan professed to be one of the better films though that was a tough shoot for him and William Holden since Peckingpah demanded they work long hours in the grueling heat.
