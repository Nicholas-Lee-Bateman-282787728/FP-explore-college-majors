8311836,5,B00008VKMW,"I've been watching Bull Ridnig since I was a small boy in Texas and never get tired of the action.  Every ride has it's own suspense, and thrills, and danger.  And of course, it's all because these bulls are 2,000 pound monsters that can really do some cowboy damage!
What's great about this video collection is it's all about the Bulls.  Each of the six videos feature 5 really great bulls from the last 10 years and groups together a whole parade of whos who riders ... by Bull.  These are really great bulls such as Grasshopper, Yellow Jacket, and Trick or Treat.
The series is hosted by Bob Tallman and Boyd Polhamus so you also know it's going to be top level stuff.
If you like Bull Riding this really is a great video collection.  If you like NASCAR, NFL FOOTBAL, WWF, or MONSTER TRUCKS you should really give this video a try.  Like it says on the box, this really is 3 hours of none stop action.
IT'S A GREAT VIDEO COLLECTION.",1053648000,2,935,4.344827586206897
