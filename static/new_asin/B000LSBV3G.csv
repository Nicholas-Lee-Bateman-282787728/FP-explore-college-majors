8164030,3,B000LSBV3G,A bit cheesy. Actors over exaggerate expressions. Nice DVD Interface though. Short vignettes good. OK productions values. Probably best for Police Departments. An introduction to concepts. Better DVDs out there.,1428796800,4,211,6.066666666666666

8164032,3,B000LSBV3G,"Pretty expensive for what it is.  It had very general information,  move of an overview in my opinion.  It seemed to be geared more towards corporate business types or police. I was hoping for something different.",1415404800,5,213,4.861111111111111

8164034,5,B000LSBV3G,All DVDs that I ordered came in one package in a short period of time. These DVDs are good educational DVDs if you want to learn and understand basic body language. I'm glad I bought these DVDs.,1334102400,5,194,4.27027027027027
8164035,4,B000LSBV3G,There are not too many body language DVD's out there.  This video really helps and goes over the basics.  It is pretty pricey for the length of it but the info is well worth it.,1325116800,12,177,4.0285714285714285
