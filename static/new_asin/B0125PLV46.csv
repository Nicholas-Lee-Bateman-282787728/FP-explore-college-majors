8725455,5,B0125PLV46,I was drawn in by the intro short they did on Facebook. I've really enjoyed the concert footage and have not yet seen all of it.  It's filmed well and the audio is great. I only wish I lived closer to Austin to enjoy this scene more regularly... like even once.  This video helps me to get close.,1474761600,2,296,4.086206896551724
