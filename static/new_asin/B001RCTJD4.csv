8337677,1,B001RCTJD4,"video shot by a person who does NOT want you to see any of the places that are photographed - starting a sequence with a tight zoom on some architectural detail is ok (kinda) but then panning along the stupid light post instead of zooming out gives the viewer nothing but a headache trying to see outside the frame - trying to see bigger scene (the one operator neglected to include).

there is no point discussing the places included because all of it is shot in that awful manner.

plus, lets not forget, the huge obtrusive text labels that are blocking half the view and are on screen for the whole duration of some shots

plus - low resolution obvious compression artifacts - unsuitable camera - not high quality video

to some up: more than a waste of money, it is a waste of time watching it looking for any decent footage

avoid!!!",1293235200,3,838,4.450980392156863
