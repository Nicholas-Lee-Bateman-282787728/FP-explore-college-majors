8064022,5,B0009NZ6PM,"This is part of the Ruth Rendell Inspector Wexford series and as with all Inspector Wexford stories this held me in suspense all through the program.  Acting is brilliant, George Baker is marvelous as Wexford as usual.  The English scenery is good and Ruth Rendell throws in plenty of red herrings to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat.",1171324800,3,341,4.573770491803279
