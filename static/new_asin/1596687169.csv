7799800,5,1596687169,"As a beginner, I used toggles, buttons and magnets for closures. Now intermediate, I became entranced with creating my own. Melinda Barta makes that possible.
Custom Clasps provides clear direction, well-paced, not too fast. The camera works with her, showing close-ups when appropriate. The package includes a website to obtain PDF written instructions and large drawings of the projects. If you've been watching YouTubes for bead instructions, I encourage you to pay for this because it's worth seeing a professional, well-done video.
The only negative was that the square, open clasp pictured on the cover was not addressed on the video other than the statement, ""Use a peyote stitch."" Sounds simple, but it wasn't.  I contacted Melinda and she directed me to a source for that specific technique. Very gracious. I look forward to beading my way though many of this exciting new options.",1380240000,,890,5.180555555555555
