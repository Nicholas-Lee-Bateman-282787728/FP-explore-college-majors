922900,4,6304744617,"This is an instant favorite!  First of all it's got two good Kung-Fu stars, Jet Li (Lethal Weapon 4, Black Mask) and Sammo Hung (CBS's Martial Law), then add a fun story/good plot, great early 80's special effects and  top it all off with mind-blowing Kung Fu!  The only draw back to this film  is it's subtitles are hard to read at some points and move quite fast.  If  you're a slow reader you should plan on having your finger on the rewind  button.  All in all this movie without a doubt makes up for it's subtitles  and is a definite for fans of the newer style of Kung-Fu movies.",933033600,,585,4.245454545454545

923046,5,6304744617,"This movie has 3 different titles

1) Kung Fu Cult Master

2) Lord of the Wu Tang

3) The Evil Cult

The 2nd title - do not get it unless you want to use the cover for your dvd to look cool.
It got cut off in the beginning of the movie - the 1st 5 minutes of the movie. It is also from the vhs version of the wu tang collection but on dvd.

The 3rd title is the best version dubbed in English, picture quality is excellent.

This movie is very good like all the reviewers who give it 5 stars.

There was a rumor back then that PART 2 was coming soon, by that time Jet Li was on his way to make other kung fu

movies to become real famous then comes Black Mask which was for rent at chinese speaking movie rental shops in

the USA, this was before he appeared in that movie Lethal Weapon 4.

So part 2 is even better than part one but it never was in production and the story was waiting for Jet Li to

star in it.",1317427200,,913,3.7777777777777777

Its somewhat over the top fantasy kung fu is great fun to watch with great cheesy chi effects and magic kung fu styles.

I've seen Lord of the Wu Tang by the way and it is a top notch cheesey sci fi Sunday morning karate flick with pull wires galore.  The story line is classic as well and well worth any amount of sub title reading and convinced me the best chinese karate flicks are sub-titled.  I've gotta contact Amazon about the switch that happened, hopefully it works out.",1279670400,,568,4.099099099099099

923155,3,6304744617,"Of all the movies I've heard, ""Lord of Wutang"" is undoubtedly the one... with the fastest pace.

Really. This movie never even pauses for breath, hurtling from one plot development to the next, and barely allowing the viewer to catch up. But if you can keep up with the rapid-fire pace, it's a rewardingly bizarre and comic adventure story with a fantastical little twist.

As a child, Mo-Kei (Jet Li) was hit with the deadly Jinx Palm, just before the terrible deaths of his parents. Mo-Kei grows up under the tutelage of a great master, but the Jinx Palm leaves him unable to fight or have sex -- until he and the sprightly marial artist Siu Chiu (Chingmy Yau) fall off a cliff.

There, Mo-Kei encounters a wacky old hermit embedded in a boulder, who teaches him the great ""Solar Stance"" kung-fu and cures him of the Jinx Palm. Now Mo-Kei can seek revenge for his parents' deaths, but he and Siu Chiu find themselves in the middle of a massive power struggle between the martial-arts schools, Shaolin monks, and the Evil Sect (which doesn't seem that evil).

""Lord of WuTang"" is really kind of confusing -- revenge vendettas spring out of nowhere, battles start without warning, and the plot is so fast-moving that the whole thing seems to be about a day and a half's worth of action -- as soon as one subplot ends, another instantly starts. And yet, somehow despite all this craziness, it's still pretty entertaining.

Perhaps that's because this isn't intended to be a serious revenge epic. It has lots of verbal and physical comedy (""Get my head off of my a**!"") and bizarre characters who are thrown in just to be bizarre, like the Red Cross sex freaks and the old hermit who rolls around inside a boulder.

But they don't neglect the kung-fu aspect, with lots of energy blasting, flying shields, and a great fast-paced duel between Li and a roaring Shaolin monk. It strikes a pretty good balance between the fantastical violence (flying killer shields?) and the realistic stuff that looks pretty bloody.

It's hard to keep the dozens of characters straight, especially since some of the girls are almost identical in dress and body language. But Li is appealing as the naive, peace-loving guy, and Yau is just as fun as his sprightly, spunky love interest. She even gets the kung-fu equivalent of a catfight.

""Lord of Wutang"" is almost too fast paced to follow, but it still has a bizarre charm. Definitely worth watching.... so long as you don't leave the room.",1169683200,,2470,4.701388888888889
923156,4,6304744617,"I got this at blockbuster on extended play VHS for under ten bucks, and it is one of my favorite buys.

I don't know if a DVD version would improve it, but I love the wire stunts, the mystical imagery, fauvist cinematography and grand sense of adventure and humor.

The end is an hypnotic Wong Jing/ Jing Wang directed spectacle, which thrills but then disappoints as the film doesn't deliver a sequel, similar to the original animated Lord of the Rings movie.  Take it like an old saturday afternoon serial film or a comic book that never ends, and it's not a bother.

I guess I forgot the limited crude humor, which is slightly worse than a whoopee cushion, but still is not quite R rated..  Check out the alternate title 'Lord of Wutang' here on Amazon for more reviews on this film.",1143072000,,786,4.468531468531468
923157,3,6304744617,"I didn't care for this movie the first time I watched it. It is pretty far from believable.  But the 2nd time I watched it and I knew what to expect I enjoyed it a lot more.  No, humans don't shoot lightning colored chi out of their hands.  And people can't live being strapped to a large boulder.  But it is still a good kung fu flick.

This one is SUB-TITLED and sometimes hard to read.  White letters on a white background.  I would like to find another version of this movie that has been dubbed in English for my collection.",1120348800,13,529,4.178217821782178
923158,5,6304744617,"Jet Li plays Chang Mo Kei, a young fellow who was injured as a child by a life threatening Kung Fu move called the ""Jinx Palm"", which has made him weak and unable to learn Kung Fu. Plus on the same day his parents were both forced to commit suicide, which, as you might expect, was also no fun. Mo Kei is raised by his father's former master, a spry 100 year-old played with great aplomb by an unrecognizable, white-haired Sammo Hung, who also did a very good job as the fight choreographer for the film. The plotline is too complex to summarize, but needless to say Jet Li starts kicking ass and taking names pretty quickly. The film is of the fantastic Kung Fu variety, with people flying through the air, and using magical Kung Fu powers which put Jedi Knights and Neo to shame.

""The Evil Cult"" has a variety of english titles and is based on a chinese martial arts novel which hasn't been translated to any western languages as far as I'm aware. It was supposed to be the first in a trilogy, but it didn't make enough money and so even though Jet Li, Sammo Hung, and the others involved fought to make them, it never came to pass. Apparently there have been some other films and TV Series made following the same story, but the most recent TV Series from 2003 hasn't made it to North America yet.

  Still this first part of an incomplete saga is a great kung fu flick, primarily because of the incredibly quick pace, intricate plotline, bad humour, and non stop ass-kicking fun. It overwhelms the senses and if this type of flick is your cup of tea, I think you'll find this is as good as it gets. It seems to be a style of film you either get or you don't, so don't be put off by any bad reviews you see. This isn't Proust, but has its own virtues. If you like it, you likely be frustrated when it ends before resolving much of anything plot-wise, but just hold on, I'm sure they'll do a proper remake in ten years with genetic clones of the original cast or thereabouts. We'll see.",1114646400,24,1989,4.296
923159,2,6304744617,"Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused.  Was it the same movie?  The martial arts were ""ok"" in this, but nothing I haven't seen done better before.  The story-line  was.. ummm. well, nevermind.

Oh and did I mention the film doesnt end????  I mean I didn't really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though.

I really wantedto like this movie... but the only good thing I can say is that some of the sub-titles are hilarious!",1113868800,5,478,4.2444444444444445
923160,5,6304744617,I have seen this movie many times and is one of my favourite kung fu movies till date. The special effects are a bit dated but still very much enjoyable. But the movie doesn't have a proper ending and  leaves much to be desired. I don't know if it has a sequel. It has great fighting scenes and fascinating characters. Just don't expect a great story. But all in all a very enjoyable movie experience. Don't think twice and buy the movie specially at such a low price.,1110067200,7,468,4.318181818181818

923311,3,6304744617,"I bought this dvd under the title ""Kung-Fu Master"" and enjoy it.  There's humor, magic, wire-work and pretty ladies so, what's not to enjoy.  What seems to bug me the most about it is that the ending is obviously leading up to a sequel and I can't find out what that is.  If you're looking for a fun flik, this is good enough.  If you're looking for some serious story with excellant martial arts action, you'll be wasting your money buying this.",1088035200,,446,4.402439024390244
923312,5,6304744617,"while i haven't seen this movie, its the same as Kung Fu Colt Master.  to my understanding, this version has been all chopped up and the quality is low.  so speaking for the orginal, its great, it kinda reminded me of HERO, not as good of course but still like it.  just without the millions invested in HERO.
if u like Hero, Storm Riders, & Iron Monkey, buy it.  i'd consider this to be the first fantasy fu flick!
remember, get the ORGINAL, and that goes for ASIAN FLICKS.  one word for you.  EBAY !",1086739200,3,501,4.221052631578948
923313,5,6304744617,"Basically the story is about 2 swords, 1 contains (inside the sword) the instructions for the most powerful kung fu, the other contains instructions how to lead an army and become China's emperor.
But on one knows this secret. Everyone thinks these are magical swords and would give their owners invicibility.
So the fight begins for the 2 swords...
This is story a bit confusing, purely because the original story is over 3000 (3 thousand pages) long.
What makes it even more confusing is this story is a sequel to another 3000 pages Kung Fu story.
So to try and compress 6000 pages to a couple of hours on DVD would confuse any viewer unless you already know the story !
Anyway, this is the best Kung Fu story ever. It was first published on a HK news paper in the 1960s.
Most Asian males should know this story !",1049068800,3,815,4.44
923314,4,6304744617,"I'm now a grandfather.  But I've been watching kung fu movies ever since 1961, as a kid growing up in San Francisco Chinatown.  This movie rates as one of my all time favorite kung fu movies, and I own about 100 or so.
The print isn't very good.  The subtitles are hard to read.  The story is among the most complicated and convoluted, especially for the non Cantonese speaking.  But who watches a kung fu movie for plots?
What I really enjoyed about the movie is that it actually shows what the Chinese cinema could actually do.  It has tremendous battle scenes.  Despite the poor print quality, the movie has some fantastic visuals.
The movie is not a documentary.  The movie is not an ""imagined documentary.""  A lot of things seem to come out of left field.  But it's OK.  It's a MOVIE!!
Quite frankly, the movie plot could easily be translated into a Star Wars episode!",1025395200,4,873,4.496815286624204
923315,4,6304744617,First of all this movie is fantasy based so forget reality. Once you can handle that then prepare for lots of action set in olden days China. It is surprisingly very funny too. The only challenge is that I got the English subtitle version which meant I had to struggle to keep up with Jet Li's lightening speed.,1022371200,,311,4.379310344827586
923316,5,6304744617,"This flick has got to be one of the most bizzare entries in the kung fu genre if not THE most bizzare ever!  The story goes off in twenty different directions until you're wondering who's fighting who and why.  Jet Li looks a lot like an elf and this movie really reminds me of a fantasy role playing game.  Super powers and crazy fight sequences that are more off the wall that anything you've ever seen.  I guarantee it!  An assortment of really hot fighting chicks and innovative choreography make this one of my all time favorites.  Be warned however, if the idea of Jet Li flying through the air and shooting massive blue fireballs at an army of foes below seems too extreme for you to handle trust me, it is.  For everyone else, rejoice in one of the greatest wirework masterpieces of all time!",1022198400,,800,4.438356164383562
923317,4,6304744617,"Kung Fu Master, also known as The Evil Cult, is one of the most bizarre martial arts flicks I've seen in a long time.  The plot is nigh-unto incomprehensible, but involves six martial arts clans from China and Persia who are fighting over two magical swords--a skinny glowing one and a big, fat, choppy one with curlicues.  Somehow, a very young Mo-Kei, maybe only six or seven at most, is attacked by evil martial artists and left with a grey handprint on his chest.  This is the dreaded Jinx Hand.
His parents are understandably upset by this marking, and so is Mo-Kei's uncle, who is a powerful martial arts master.  You see, this handprint means young Mo-Kei will never be able to use kung-fu or have sex, or else he will die.  At least, I think that's what it means.  In the meantime, it makes him ""very painful"" and subjected to frequent bouts of near-hypothermia.
Mo-Kei's parents and his uncle rush him off to a temple where they try fruitlessly to cure him.  The parents kill themselves so that the bad guys don't learn where their ""buddy"" is hiding with his magical sword.  Just before his mother dies, she tells Mo-Kei to avenge their deaths on all the baddies.  Unfortunately, that's pretty hard to do if you don't know kung fu.  After all, there were no machine guns in this time period.
Eight years later, there's a bizarre scene where the uncle, now 108 years old discusses his morning erections with a very mature-looking 14- or 15-year old Mo-Kei (played by Jet Li).  Uncle explains that Mo-Kei does not get erections because he is weak, but that he himself is no old granny, and has them every morning!
Mo-Kei is kept alive by energy transfusions from his uncle and can only look wistfully at all the cool kung fu guys practicing their mad martial arts skillz.  Then a hot chick shows up, and he becomes even more confused when she tricks him into watching her get ready for a bath.
This is, of course, grounds to off the inoffensive Mo-Kei, and he gets chased off a cliff along with a kung fu mama with a jug-handle hairdo.  After groping her chest on the way down, Mo-Kei and the girl meet an old man imbedded in a giant boulder.  He teaches Invincible Solar Stance (or something like that) to Mo-Kei, which somehow cures him of his Jinx Hand affliction and allows Mo-Kei to kick ...
The story only gets weirder from here, with a kung fu vampire named Green Bat (who asks a master to suck poison out of his bottom), an evil queen with a lethal harpsichord (complete with harpsichord battle), a master with foot-long eyebrows, Red Cross workers with a penchant for hookers and rape, and more talk of erections.
Because Mo-Kei has become a master of Invincible Solar Stance, he learns yet another advanced style--Magical Stance--in a scant six hours.  For anyone else, it would take thirty years.  He then proceeds to kick more ... with this technique.
Mo-Kei's learning skills are increasing at an astronomical rate.  The final fight scene is great because Mo-Kei learns the entire art of t'ai chi chu'an in approximately ten seconds.  Of course, he kicks even more ...
Many ... are filled with footprints by this point.
I really don't quite understand what happens at the end, and since the movie stops without really wrapping anything up, I can only assume there is a sequel, or at least the intention for a sequel.
If you're in the mood for some REALLY over-the-top martial arts involving ropes, wires, and terrible subtitling, this is the film for you.  If you're in the mood for well-filmed martial arts choreography, look elsewhere.  This is far too silly.",1018656000,15,3581,4.64500792393027
923318,5,6304744617,".. let me just say that this is one of the very few hk fantasy films that I own, and yet its one of my favorite movies. The story is basically about 2 swords that make the users superpowerful, and there are several kung fu schools looking and fighting for it. Jet represents one of these schools and througout the film, he masters several martial art techniques at an interestingly fast pace. He needs to protect his great grandfather, who happens to know where the swords are, from the corrupt schools. Warning, this is no Fist of Legend, but the martial arts are quite decent in my opinion. Yes, there is flying and superhuman powers in this film, but it actually makes it fun, not like dumb movies like the Storm Riders (this movie is too much). Plus, the film is extremely hilarious, especially the scene where Jet gets stuck in a cave. There are also 2 extremely beautiful women in this film that just made me go gaga. Watch it and find out what I mean. Apparently this was meant to be a two part movie, so just a warning this movie will not have an ending, this is only the first part. From what I've heard the second part of this story was filmed, but it never made it to the developing studio to be released, which really [is bad] because this film just leaves you hanging. However, I'd totally recommend a buy tho, but like I said get the original Kung Fu Colt Master. I got the HK version which is presented in 5.1 dolby, and the picture is pretty clear as well. I can't say much for the World Video US release version, except that the cover looks really [bad]. However, I've heard the transfer is pretty good and it has an english dub as well.

923400,3,6304744617,"This disc is not the best in the world, but it was interesting. Obviously transferred from a video source, the disc is extras-free and not brimming over with quality processing. The overall appearance is rather muddy, and the subtitles are both duplicated in English and Chinese, and very hard to read most of the time. No chapter access, either.
On the other hand, the DVD is Widescreen, so I give credit for that. Also, this is a very different style of kung-fu film. I refer to it as a parody because that's what it reminded me of more than anything else; a parody of fantasy martial arts films. Characters not only fly and leap like superheroes, they can also blast opponents with energy bolts, lightning, magical swords, and fantasy kung-fu strikes.
The story is a bit hard to follow. Basically, bad guys looking for a magic sword cause the death of Jet Li's parents, and attack their child with with a slow-killing strike. The result is that Jet Li cannot learn kung-fu -- if he tries, he'll die! Eventually, he is cured and becomes the Master of all kung-fu by learning the secret of the ""Solar Stance"" technique from a powerful kung-fu teacher. Then, Jet can take revenge on the people who killed his parents.
Along the way, he meets up with a kung-fu mistress who helps him learn even better kung-fu, another evil kung-fu mistress who wants the handsome young Jet Li for herself, an a bad kung-fu mistress who now controls the magic sword. He also runs into a confusing array of kung-fu masters, enemies, and armies. I admit that I got a bit lost trying to follow who was fighting who, and why. The ending was also left kind of up in the air, as if the film was meant to be the first chapter in a series.
Still, the fights are spectacular. Not quite up to the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" standards, but spectacular nevertheless. In one scene, Jet is attacked with harp strings by the evil mistress, and in another, an army is devestated by an underground assault!
Overall, the film is a lot of fun, mostly because it takes itself seriously (albeit with tongue firmly planted in cheek). Despite the shoddy processing, the disc is definitely worth the low price for Jet Li fans, or for ""Crouching Tiger"" fans with a sense of humor.",1010534400,8,2238,4.569651741293533
923401,4,6304744617,"Just a little history on the movie story line.  The movie is based on a book.  The book was also done as a T.V. series way before the movie.  I recall them being about 26 episodes (Thats 26 tapes!) of about 2 hours each.  (Or 1 hour...  I was a long time ago )  I abosultly loved it!
Anyways, that also explains the dizzy pace of the movie, because it crams about a 3rd of the series into one movie.  It also explains the ending because it's not over yet.
I wish Jet li will make a sequal for this to complete the story line!  It could be a trilogy!
Anyways, let me spoil your future for you a little.
The story is about two swords which are unbreakable.  So the owners who use it becomes very strong.  (Like the Green Destiny in Crouching Tiger.  BTW, the clan that Jet Li originally belonged to with Sammo is the same Wu Dan clan as in crouching tiger)
Every one wants the sword.  The story evolved into Jet Li mastering all the highest techniques of each martial arts school.  He always ends up stuck somewhere with a master or a place with the secrets written down.
He falls in love (out of like 5 or 6 to choose from) and drives the mongols out of china.  the end.
A little history note here (I am no expert, but).  Wu Dan clan is very popular because they were the clan which gathered all the martial arts schools and groups and drove out the mongols out of china.  Just like the movie.",1005955200,2,1392,4.138059701492537

If you can get past the subs the movie has great fight scences, Beautiful but deadly fighting babes, Incredible weapons(liquid sword)& Old gray haired guys with Madd kung fu skills. I did not even know one of the gray haired was Sammo Hung until the 3rd time I watched it. I highly recommend it.",1005177600,,402,4.302631578947368

The effects are really over-the-top, & the things I found most humorous about it were probably not intended as such. Nevertheless, I have watched it several times and I find it very appealing on some level. Jet Li is really sort of wasted in this flick, because so much of it is ""magic"" & ""super secret final techniques"" that his real martial arts ability is not truly showcased. One feels that anyone else could have played the part... kind of like finding the special gismo that turns ordinary kids into Power Rangers. Still, it is worth having this film in your collection, especially if your funny bone is tickled by the weird and offbeat.",998611200,,775,4.6231884057971016

I mean, it's not like Drunken Master(w/ Jacky Chan in it), it's more like a fantasy/super hero type movie.  Don't be fooled by people telling you it's just a bunch of guys flying around.

923518,4,6304744617,"This 1993 film is one of the few olden-day movies kung-fu artist Jet Li has done that isn't during the Manchu era. ""Kung-Fu Cult Master"" is so creative that if you only like realistic kung-fu movies, you won't appreciate this one. ""Kung-Fu Cult Master"" includes various types of kung-fu from different schools and temples, and the majority of fight scenes are highly original. Also, wirework is impressive, however does not mar the fighting sequences. Jet Li also gives one of the most impressive martial arts performances in his career, with great choreography done by Sammo Hung.
The scenery, like the traps and tomb in the movie, are impressive and filled with creative ideas that only a very broad-minded person could think of. Again, this movie isn't realistic, but the plot is well-developed (except may be a bit confusing the first time, and the end leaves you hanging.) The movie was left hanging with an ending that will nag at you for a week in wonders of what happens, for a sequel to ""The Kung-Fu Cult Master"" was planned, however never released, even though enough scenes were shot to make the movie; the scenes were never turned into a finished product.
Acting is highly amusing at times and at others, very moving. Jet Li and Chingymy Yau Suk-Ching pair up AGAIN to bring impressive performances that are heightened by superb directing by famous Wong Jing, choreographed kung-fu scenes by Sammo Hung, and the movie's set. If you're a kung-fu movie fan, this is near perfection.
Supporting actors and actresses:  Chingmy Yau Suk-Ching - (City Hunter w/ Jackie Chan, Ghost Lantern w/ Tony Leung, God of Gamblers w/ Chow Yun-Fat, Legend of the Liquid Sword w/ Aaron Kwok, Young & Dangerous 2 w/ Ekin Cheng, & New Legend of Shaolin & High Risk w/ Jet Li)

923519,4,6304744617,"I originally saw this movie at the Towne Theatre in San Jose, CA, where it was released in US theatres under the same title. I do not own the DVD and will not comment on quality or sound.
I found this movie on video at the World Video Store in Sunnyvale, CA, where the clerk told me it was based on a novel that was the Chinese equivilent of 'War & Peace'. It revolves around a pair of swords. This movie mainly refers to one of them, called the 'Yee Tin' sword. When I asked the clerk what the Chinese title of this movie was, he said in broken English ""Yee Tin Slays Dragon""(?)
As for the movie review, sheesh.. where to begin. We'll start with Jet Li's character as a child. His parents are attacked by some enemies known as the 'Two Jinxes'. One of them hits the child, making him ill for life. Then a confusing sequence where his dad dies, and his mother commits suicide while the leaders of 20 clans (everything from Wutang to Shaolin) bicker and argue over 'who killed who' and 'saving face' and all those other CHK vengeance cliche's. Jet Li survives with the help of an old Taoist Tai Chi master played by Sammo Hung. The other students, feeling envious of him because of their master's special treatment, take advantage of Sammo's abscence by beating him up and banishing him.
Yes, the plot is very confusing. There are what seems like hundreds of armies, and all of them arguing over things that happened in the past. But since when has plot played a major role in a Honk Kong martial arts movie? If you're a fan of CHK fung fu fantasy movies, here is the mother of them all (with the exception of maybe 'Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain').
While being chased out of his home, Jet Li is joined by a cute female thief who is looking for the Yee Tin Sword to break her silver shackles. Deep in the valley they bump into an old man chained to a floating boulder who is tricked by Jet Li into teaching him the 'Solar Stance'. This cures the jinx he's had since childhood, and at the same time gives him superhuman martial arts skills. Whereupon he flies into a battle where 10 different armies are trying to kill each other. After mowing down 50 people in a row, he flies above the battle and even fires energy bolts from his fists at the soldiers below. Then he gets trapped in a cave where he reads some graffiti and learns the 'Magic Stance'. Now that he's a God, it's time for some payback. And all of this in the first 15 minutes of the movie!!!
Just kidding, but you'll understand why I poke fun after you've experienced the dizzy pace of this film for yourself.
Overkill? Definitely. As this movie was originally planned to be filmed in two parts, the ending leaves you dangling. The sequel was never made. The rest is history. Just don't try to understand the plot and you probably won't be disappointed with this visual rollercoaster. I generously give it 4 stars because of the over the top battles and the fantasy elements. Only in Hong Kong cinema is style over substance synonymous with raw fun.",990144000,6,3017,4.408602150537634

Crazy kung-fu  story, over the top acting and more Matrix-like action sequences than you  can shake a big stick at. The plot may be hard to follow, but if you want  plot, watch Meryl Streep. This movie is about kicking ass, and believe me,  everyones ass gets kicked. Different fighting styles satisfy the amateur  kung-fu-ist, and the over the top wire movements make this seem more like a  live action manga.

Helpful to understand some Chinese specific beliefs like the concept of poisoning.  My understanding that he is coughing up poison when he learns the great solar stance.  Also, the actress who plays his mother reappears in a different role several minutes later, which could be confusing.  Movie has multiple names, this is the U.S. release title.
