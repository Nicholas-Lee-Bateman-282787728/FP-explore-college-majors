8177064,5,B000NDEWI0,Wonderful video! My fianc and I are using volume 1 & 2 to help to learn to waltz for our wedding. The instructions in the video are incredibly helpful and something you can not find online. I would highly recommend both volume 1 & 2 of these videos. My only disappointment is that I can't find volume 3.,1423440000,,303,4.241379310344827
8177065,4,B000NDEWI0,"Last month, I tried out the Beginning Waltz: A Step-By-Step Guide! Volume 2 from DanceCrazy. Even if you're not a dancer, there is a good chance that you heard about the dance called the Waltz or you have seen it in a movie with classic stars like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

This DVD runs at almost 53 minutes and features a male and a female instructors, who give a step-by-step guide on how to do the Waltz. At the end of the DVD the instructors put all the moves together for a full dance sequence.

The moves featured on this DVD are:

Open Break With Underarm Turn

The Twinkle

The Promenade

The Dip

Similar to other DanceCrazy DVDs, the production value is a low-budget one with the same yellow curtains and flooring which can be a little off-putting to some viewers. If you can forget about the set and just pay attention to the moves, then you can easily learn how to dance with or without a partner. Overall, Beginning Waltz: A Step-By-Step Guide! Volume 2 was created for someone like me that has two left feet and it is an easy way to learn how to dance correctly.

8177068,4,B000NDEWI0,"I like that the DVD shows the steps from both the male, and female point of view, then together before adding in music. It slowly adds to a routine step by step.

The only thing that would make it better is to have a professional there letting you know for sure if you're positioned correctly.",1418947200,,359,4.217391304347826
