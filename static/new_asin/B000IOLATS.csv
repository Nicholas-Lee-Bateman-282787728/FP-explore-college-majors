8185727,5,B000IOLATS,"Maybe the best series on the history of mankind, science, art and culture. I first watched it on PBS in 1977, and it is still one of my favorites of all time.",1416096000,,158,3.96875
8185728,4,B000IOLATS,"As much as I admired and enjoyed a lot of this, I couldn't help finding it a bit wordy and dry, even dull at times at times.

That said, it's also full of interesting insight and theories by writer/host Jacob Bronowski.

13 parts, each covering a different key step in the development of civilization. It felt like a very interesting illustrated college lecture series.

A few of Brononski's theories seem a bit stretched, or even wrong headed, and the visual style is dated and the effects less than impressive, but that doesn't mean the series isn't interesting, thought provoking and occasionally moving.

I'd recommend it without question, but be careful of all the 'it's the greatest thing ever made for television' you may have heard. Sometimes nothing can damage your experience like over-extended expectations.",1305072000,2,818,5.082089552238806
