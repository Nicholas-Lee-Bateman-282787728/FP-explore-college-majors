8729278,3,B0141KAA2W,"The terminology  art house has been thrown around in so many different ways. Some view the terminology meaning a film that does not conform to Hollywood. Others will view it as a small film trying to break some waves. Then there are those who will feel it is a film that is created from an emotion of expression that could only be relatable to a certain amount of people. Madness of Many is a film that can fall under all three of those categories. This film is what a company liked Unearthed Films seems to make its reputation on. A film that gives you art but does it in a way that most casual film watchers will be turned off by, while cult fans and demented minds will flock towards. Madness of Many starts off as this poetic film that the narrator guides us thru the first of four chapters that start from  Birth to the ending of  Rebirth. Victoria tells us her story which we learn that she was an abused girl that later on turned to prostitution and drug use. That is as far as the character depth will go. The story that is told to us is that she was abused, starved and raped by her family. Well she escapes only to become an experiment of sorts for some unknown person. This film in ways reminded me of if Lucifer Valentine directed the remake to Martyrs. This film I am to assume is us watching Victoria go thru some rite of passage or better yet, a brutal second coming. Most of the dialogue in the film is her narration on what she is thinking during the time we are witnessing.

The way she talks in the film seems emotionless to me. Some of the scenes were horrific and beautiful at the same time but she does not even try to show emotion in the way she speaks to the audience. The awfulness of her life seems to be the running theme thru the first three chapters of the film, and it just seems to get redundant as she goes on and on about it. The positives for me were the visuals that this film pulls off. I am into the vomit gore as people know, and this film has some sick moments in it that capture it. For the warning we got at the beginning I was expecting this film to be far more graphic and intense than it was, and to me that was a bit of a letdown but what it did offer, was really well shot. The negatives to me are the acting, not so much the actual acting but the way the dialogue came across in narration. It sounded like someone reading a menu to us in one style. It needed emotion, it needed passion and it needed to be more impactful to see the stuff happening on screen. As a whole, I loved the visuals of this film but yet hated the acting and dialogue that was force fed to us. The film is definitely sick and sinister in its mood and the way it presents itself, but yet by the end I found the journey sort of lackluster.
