6105310,5,B00GRZPRQ4,"I thought the volume DVDs had various episodes from the same season. But when I read the back if the DVD case, it showed episodes from Seasons 1, 3, & 5 rather than just Season 5. I already have some of those episodes on my other Adventure Time DVDs. It's still ok though. I haven't gotten it yet but UPS shows it's out for delivery.",1399334400,,333,4.138461538461539

8626534,5,B00GRZPRQ4,"Yes, I understand that this cartoon is actually for kids. However, watching cartoons such as this actually help my creativity. I have actually been watching this cartoon since 2011 and even got my husband interested in this cartoon.  I actually wanted to watch this cartoon when it first came out in 2010, but I had to hold off until 2011 when more time became available. I found out about Adventure Time: The Suitor through a television feature at my job (during one of my breaks). I confess that this was easy to do because he sometimes like to also watch cartoons (he had previously got me interested in Phineas and Ferb).  The Suitor dvd has sixteen episodes spread out from different seasons (there have been at least six seasons so far and my husband told me that it looks like they are working on seven). There is also a mini-feature on some of the cartoon characters. The Vault was actually one of my favorite episodes from this dvd set because  it touches a little bit on mortality beyond a normal human lifespan.  The title for the dvd (The Suitor) touches on Princess Bubblegums attempts to gently deal with a person who is infatuated with her and having her personal assistant (Peppermint Butler) screen those who want time with her.",1403740800,,1245,4.671232876712328
