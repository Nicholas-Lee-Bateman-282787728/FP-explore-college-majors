1346917,5,B00004RYDB,"This is an excellent movie, a knockout in several ways. It tells the true story of a popular German singing group in the 30's called the Comedian Harmonists. Unfortunately the group had several Jewish members and not even their huge popularity could save them from official sanctions as Hitler's  thugs came to power. Not only is The Harmonists musically and historically  impressive, it's also interesting because it's the first German production  I have ever seen that deals with pre-WWII Nazi bigotry. It's got some  aspects of Cabaret in that respect, but this is a real story and all the  more gripping for it. The acting is first rate, the writing is superb. I  watched it a second time immediately.",956361600,15,705,4.882352941176471

Roger said he thought he was the only human being  to have seen the film.  The president thought it was a gripping tale that  really delivered a message for Americans and the society around us.

1346939,5,B00004RYDB,"Absolute fine Art and remake of the Original Comedian Harmonists. Their story and Music brings you
back in their time and world of Entertainment. One could believe that is the original, so beautiful the costumes,
hair style, background and behavior of people during that time.
This story is not always funny at all, there conflicts involved, dramas and altogether emotional too.
If you love good old sounds, without electronic make up, the real wonderful, romantic kind of music, that would
be thee movie to see.  Enjoy it, you will love it.

1346942,4,B00004RYDB,"Worth watching for the music, in an old fashioned, Hollywood-like re-creation.  Excellent performances, but, except for the authentic recordings, ""The Harmonists"" is done in the unrealistic manner of a 1950s biographical film.",1384819200,,226,6.0625

1346948,3,B00004RYDB,"I found this to be an interesting piece of history.  I had never heard of this musical group and so it was fun to see them perform and to find out a bit of their personal lives, as well as how each of them dealt with the threats of the uprising of Nazism in Germany.

The sets, costumes and especially the stage performances were interesting to see.  With our modern taste in music, this group's style could be seen as pleasantly quaint.

The romantic element gives the story a little more snap than the simple tale of how the group rose and fell.  I found the woman who plays Erna quite touching...she has a simple charm and vulnerability that is delightful.  Her tearful breakdown scene in the group's final performance was very well done and extremely touching.  I really didn't understand her shift in her attentions (I won't say more) between the men; the film didn't make it credible.

The other actors were very good.  I thought the character of Bob, the blond haired fellow who was frequently at odds with the main character to be the most interesting because we see all sides of him.  The character I had the hardest time with was the main fellow, whose name I've already forgotten.  I found his brand of pixie like cuteness appealing for the first half of the film but as it dragged on (and it was long and slow...) his appeal waned.  I was actually happy to read in the afterwards posted on the screen that he and his wife eventually divorced.  I can see why.  But that's just my opinion.

As mentioned I did find the film overly long.  In sum, it's a valuable addition to the information we have of the trials of German citizens during the Hitler era.  As an entertainment, it will appeal to fans of music of that era.  To others...well try it and see.",1341619200,,1764,4.442367601246106
1346959,1,B00004RYDB,"I was looking forward to watching a movie about the Comedian Harmonists and purchased a DVD from M&L. The DVD was promptly mailed and promptly received. Sadly, I found that I could not play this DVD on any of my systems because it was in PAL format. The Phase Alternating Line system is an analogue television color encoding system used in broadcast television systems in Europe, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa, and Asia. It is not used stateside. Here in the states, we use an NTSC format.

What does any of this mean? The DVD I purchased was clearly meant for the European market. Unless you have a DVD and TV player with multisystem capabilities, you won't be able to play this particular film.

I was disappointed that at the time I made this purchase, the ad for this film did not mention that it was in PAL format. Had I known that this DVD was unplayable on any of my current systems, I wouldn't have purchased it.",1331164800,2,933,4.450292397660819

1346962,5,B00004RYDB,"A true story, remembered by some old folks who experienced it first hand - at least to listen to. The film is lit by the wonderful sounds the close-harmony group that sings at its center. Though several Jews were among its members and family, so beloved was the group tby the German public and audiences abroad that for a long time the Nazis felt constrained from touching them. When finally they were warned that the Jewish contingent must be dropped, the group disbanded instead. All the members managed to get out of Germany. Not one was arrested or or interned. It ends on a bittersweet note, but nothing can take away from the joy of the music.",1295222400,,649,4.555555555555555

1346978,5,B00004RYDB,The best German movie to date. I have a good collection but this out preforms all others. A must have for your German or even just plain Films collection.,1207353600,2,154,4.344827586206897
1346979,3,B00004RYDB,"One of those movies that could not decide whether it was a comedy or a tragedy. Still it is interesting for the somewhat inaccurate depiction of the real life 1920's and 30's German sextet, ""The Comedian Harmonists"". Anyone wanting to know the real story can refer to Wikipedia or the various websites featuring the group. Many of the songs can be heard on ""YouTube"".

I won't dwell on the anachronisms and inaccuracies in the movie. Taken as a whole they are not really important. Two things save the movie:  the portrayal of the darkening milieu in Germany in the late 1920's and early 1930's and the use of the actual recorded songs of the original Comedian Harmonists. Their songs were and remain real treasures of the genre. The lip-synching is done with typical German skill. The Gerrmans are true masters of that art. To see some of the best of these songs shown in the film in the context of the times is one of those magic tricks that movies perform. It is just a pity that the trick was not performed better.",1206144000,10,1018,4.557377049180328
1346980,5,B00004RYDB,"What an amazing story! A sining group from Germany with 3 Jewish singers at the begining of WWII.

1346981,4,B00004RYDB,"If you thought ""Schindler's List"" came off a little heavy-handed and patronizing, you are not the only one. I find movies such as ""Sophie's Choice"" and the ""Comedian Harmonists"" to be infinitely more effective in relaying the sadness and depressing realities of the Nazi fanaticism. Whereas ""Schindler's List"" is one numbing horror story after another, the smaller stories mentioned above have the ability to focus the viewers attention and admisration on a smaller range of characters and themes.

Watching this film was simultaneously uplifting and depressing-the fine characters practicing their art while the politics trudge on. The last concert scene is one of the more heartrenching aspects of this film. Hitler's drones allowing one last go-around before the Jews are disbanded from the group forcefully. It's amazing how petty the politics were-ranging from music,literature and artwork. We all know the end result, but it's more interesting to me to see it's effects and roots from a different viewpoint.

The music of course is the big draw here. Good acting and singing easily overcome some of the staid visual direction. Some scenes looked like they were slapped together. The sets were obvious and did not successfully visualize pre WW2 Germany and the depressed economy.",1109030400,12,1284,5.320197044334975
1346982,5,B00004RYDB,"The Harmonists is a movie about the real life singing group which rose to fame during World War II. The group was torn apart by the Nazis and ended their brilliant career abruptly.
The movie does a great job of showing how the six men had very different personalities from each other but blended together to create incredible music. There was love and bitterness, friendship and joy. The group focusses on singing for their audience, but in the meantime the Nazi power grows.
There are three Jewish men in the group, and each one looks at his faith differently. There are also Jewish women involved with the men, and each situation causes friction and difficulty. The group gets more and more pressure to abandon its Jewish members.
The group does visit New York, where all but one member want to stay. Because of that one member, though, the group returns to Germany. Shortly after, they are banned from singing and the three Jewish members leave Germany permanently.
The actual group, the Comedian Harmonists, are still considered to be one of the greatest groups in Europe and their records are treasured. If you haven't heard of this group before, be sure to watch the DVD! The musical performances are a real treat and the story is quite moving.",1076889600,34,1250,4.764976958525345
1346983,4,B00004RYDB,"The time and place is Germany as Hitler is coming to power.  The story centers on the genesis of the Comedian Harmonists, a group of five singers and the piano player who accompanies them.  We can't be sure how much of the story has much truth value, but we do know that the Harmonists were a real group and their music was much appreciated, and remains so even today.  They are called ""comedian"" because of their lighthearted and humorous approach to the music they sing.
The founder of the group is a jew, Harry Frommermann.  He is a talented singer/arranger and his vision is to bring together an exceptional group of men to sing ""jazzed up"" and highly stylized versions of popular songs.  Harry is a perfectionist and the first third of the film shows him first cajoling and then badgering his singers to develop a musically unique and visually entertaining style.  He succeeds beyond even his ambitious dreams.  Soon the Comedian Harmonists are a feature act in demand not only in Germany, but internationally.
Unfortunatley for the Harmonists, Hitler comes to power in 1933, just as the group is headed for true stardom.  Jews in Germany are beginning to feel the impact of the racial hatred that will end in the holocaust.  Of the six members of the Harmonists, three are jews and as the story progresses, first restrictions and then cancellations of their concerts prevent the group from finding an audience in Germany for their work.  They head to New York and find success there.  Harry would like to remain in America, but the rest of the band still believes there is a chance for some success in Germany, so they head home again.
The Harmonists' error in judgment is typical of the mistake of many jews in Germany who thought they only needed to patiently wait for reason to return to their country. At the end of the film we see the Harmonists on stage in Munich performing to an audience that knows that something very special is being lost to them. The Harmonists disband and the jewish members escape to freedom.  The group left in Germany tries to reconstitute the band, as does the group that leaves, but they do not experience the success of the original members.
If it were not for the music, which is truly first-rate, this story would be interesting, but not worth four stars.  Because the music is so much a part of the film, those viewers who enjoy vocal singing at its very best are sure to enjoy this unusual film.",1067731200,5,2440,4.633410672853828
1346984,5,B00004RYDB,"I was unaware that this was based on a true story until the very end of the film, when photographs of the original Comedian Harmonists were shown.  The story line is so gripping, it almost seems too contrived to be true.  And, given the immense talent and popularity of the group (in its heydey), I was surprised that I had never heard of them.  The story is about a group of six musicians, three of whom are Jewish, who rise to fame in Germany in 1930s.  Tension grows within the group as the Nazis become increasingly powerful in Germany.  After the group performs aboard the USS Saratoga in New York harbor, there is some question about whether they will return to Nazi Germany or stay in the US.  The group plays its final concert to a sold-out crowd shortly after the New York trip.  The movie will leave you wanting to know much more about its members, particularly Mr. Frommerman, and its music.  As an added bonus, the five-part harmonies are FANTASTIC.  This is one of the most gripping shows I've seen in several months, it came as a complete surprise.",1044057600,12,1062,4.518324607329843
1346985,4,B00004RYDB,"Let's get the negatives over first. Just about every musical has some hokey scene where musicians who have either just met for the first time or who have yet to gel suddenly click and produce music that, if not miraculous, is at least fit to be included on the soundtrack album.  It happens in Hollywood flicks and it happens here too.  After being rejected at their first audition, a struggling German vocal group in late '20s Berlin is just about to pack it in, when in a burst of inspiration they turn their pity party into an extraordinary vocal jam session (where their uncanny ability to imitate musical instruments is revealed) and the rest is, as they say, history: their ultimate success, a given.
That much may seem like formula--and maybe some of the boy-girl aspects of storyline may seem like familiar territory as well (two friends and musical collaborators competing for the love of the same girl).  But the movie IS fact based, and presumably reasonably true to actual events.  Of course, when those events take place against the historical backdrop of the rise of Nazism and the first intimations of the Holocaust to come, then they take on an additional poignancy.  The inevitable squabbles and petty jealousies of musical partners will soon to be dwarfed by the sheer enormity of the historical events brewing all around them.  We know it: they don't (yet).  Therein lies much of the film's emotional power.
Much has been made of the fact that half the group, who come to be billed as ""The Comedian Harmonists,"" was Jewish and that they nonetheless enjoyed considerable popularity in a society beginning to seethe over with anti-Semitism.  In fact, the film plotline has top Nazi officials numbering among its biggest fans.  The suggestion is that even the cruelest of hearts could be touched by music this bright, happy and fun. The tendency toward denial among German Jews (and other Germans!) is also hinted at.  Surely, these beloved artists would be spared  from the coming nightmare!  It can't happen ""hier""!
The movie is somewhat evocative of other films involving struggling entertainers in the pre-Hitler era.  Like CABARET, it is a supremely entertaining musical with a political punch.  But it's not nearly as dark as that film, or as other films that tread similar terrain (Bergman's SERPENT'S EGG, Visconti's THE DAMNED).  Aside from their considerable musical talent, these characters are actually everyman types.  Oh sure, they party hard and get their start singing in a brothel.  But they all possess a certain innocence nonetheless.  This is not quite the demimonde: it's more a bunch of blokes getting together to make light, humorous, jazzy music while the world around them crumbles.
They are indeed Comedians as well as Harmonists.  But, as they say, sometimes the line between comedy and tragedy is a fine one.",1029456000,11,2852,4.9663157894736845
1346986,5,B00004RYDB,"the average american movie goer might not expect too much from a german movie,and mostly isn't that wrong. But when we make good movies,than they're really great.
If you want to get a feeling about ""how could all these have happened?""you'll find a splinter of it in a movie that describes the life of six artists from the late 20s to the life under Nationalsozialismus before WWII.Seldom a movie made me cry like this, the struggle of the six for their art and the daily life struggles, the love they shared and they shouldn't have shared, their creed,they fought for and how the good in life ends under the boots of evil- and more, ends, cause too many turned their heads, reminding everybody of us on the words of german poet H.Heine:In einem Land, in dem Bcher brennen, brennen bald auch Menschen(in a country where books burn,soon will burn humans)written 100 years before Hitler. The movie not only is a must for every german, it also is a must for everybody who wants to understand what will be the consequences of turning your head and keep silent.
Excellent sound, graet acting and camera combined with a detail-obsessed directing and a music that is eternal, based on a story only life can write.
But when the US-DVD is available only with 2.0 sound german audio-track and english subtitles and your german isn't that bad at all,stay with the german region 2 coded version with its 5.1 audio track.
