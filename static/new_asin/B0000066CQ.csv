1191463,5,B0000066CQ,"A great movie. The action scenes - especially the ""hair raising"" plane chase featuring a crazy Telly Savalas (no joke intended) are shot to maximum effect for the wide screen with action going on on both sides of one's peripheral vision!

With solid performances and tight efficient direction this is a stand out movie of the 1970s that more or less covers all the bases in the oft touted conspiracy theory concerning the '""faking"" of the moon landings and puts it to bed.

It's not Sci Fi but a superb fast paced thriller and the Blu Ray treatment is the next best thing to actually seeing this on the big screen. In my case this was the 70mm presentation at the Odeon, Woolwich, London. I can still remember it - I don't think I have ever experienced since then a cinema audience who were so happy and exhilerated by the film they had just watched, by applauding at the end and spilling out onto the street laughing and chatting about different scenes. Wonderful!

The ending is a real treat! Talk about coming back from the dead!",1498089600,,1032,4.537634408602151

1191467,5,B0000066CQ,"I chose re-watching this movie when I wanted to see something withOUT the undead and where every cop, every teacher, every actor, every athlete, every politician and every family were not being portrayed as drug addled, homicidal nitwits...in other words watching most of what's being made now.  This is a fulfilling adventure with more than a ring of truth in these conspiracy theorizing days.  It's fun, the real air stunts are not created on a laptop and digitized by a 20 year-old.  Old fashioned movie making with a kickin' Jerry Goldsmith score  If it won't make current politics go away, at least it's a short vacation from such.  Enjoy!",1493164800,,644,4.871559633027523

1191534,5,B0000066CQ,"This 1977 film shows that landing on the moon (actually  in 1969) was a fake, a conspiracy.  It's a thriller with the crew involved, being hunted by the government and you'll have to watch it to find out how it ends.",1474070400,,216,4.2439024390243905
1191535,5,B0000066CQ,"When I saw the ads for this movie, I thought it was just a dumb conspiracy story trying to prove that we never landed on the moon. One weekend I was laid over in Buffalo back in 78 and this was playing at a theater - right on the airport glide path so we got to hear the roar of planes taking off in addition to the sound track.  I decided it would probably be stupid but I had nothing better to do.  Well in this reality, the moon landings were real, but it's about a faked mission to Mars.  The hardware is... identical to the Apollo craft and lunar lander used for the moon voyages, probably because the film's budget didn't allow for a total redesign of the spacecraft.  Truth is, the Apollo lunar module would not be suitable for landing on Mars or any planet with an atmosphere, or gravity greater than the moon.  And three guys in an Apollo capsule for 8 days is one thing, but for 8 months?  Don't think so. Anyway, suspending that disbelief is part of the fun.  Character actor David Huddleston has a minor role as an acid tongued Congressman who is pro-space exploration - apparently in the extreme minority.  The astronauts are led by James Brolin, and his crewmates are OJ Simpson an Sam Waterston.  And the bad guy is Hal Holbrook, in one of his most coldly evil roles. The whole plot is being chased down by reporter Elliot Gould, basically playing Elliot Gould.  There's a wonderful ""you're fired"" speech by David Doyle as Gould's boss, which goes down as one of the most memorable screeds ever put on film.  Gould is alone in his investigation, his friends disappear, he's framed, all the standard paranoid big brother stuff but he keeps at it until he literally stumbled smack into the middle of what he's been looking for, and the resulting chase - two faceless black helicopters chasing Telly Savalas (who does to this film what Richard Pryor's late arrival in ""Silver Streak"" accomplished) and Gould in a crop duster.  The flying stunts are so mind blowing that it's obvious that even the cameramen were in grave danger.  I saw this on the big screen only once but I still remember the sensation, almost like a Disney ride, when Savalas's biplane, flying low and level drops a 90-degree vertical dive into a canyon.  The ending is one of the best ever.  The decision was made to not stretch the ending out - one can easily project the ramifications of the final scene.  It's overdone and fun and you'll see flying stunts nobody does anymore, they do it all with computers.  I think this film was grossly underrated, and perhaps neglected due to the ""moon conspiracy"" connection.  I'm a life long space fan, and this film makes the NASA administration the bad guys - kind of a premonition of what was to come with the Shuttle Challenger disaster, the push to go no matter what and the stockpiling of denial by the top brass.  But watch it not to learn about a mission to Mars... or even about corruption or see OJ Simpson get a few lines as a good guy.  Watch it for the sheer fun and the characters, especially the smug sarcasm from Huddleston's congressman.  And that mind blowing chase.",1473984000,,3108,4.514285714285714

The government fakes the moon landing and then kills off people who know about it.  But  oops you can look using a telescope and SEE the part of the lander that's still on the moon.  But this movie isn't about that. it's about doing a g conspiracy movie. Only it's a silly one.  The acting is good and the film was a high budget affair.,1468368000,,510,4.101010101010101

This is a straight up pedestrian B-movie that has a good premise and happens to have some good actors (Hal Halbrook, Elliot Gould, Sam Waterson, etc) to deliver the terrible dialogue based around a terrible story arc. The most enervating boring moving possibly of the 70's. Its fascinating that just because it has a good premise and some good actors, people don't realize they are watching a terrible movie that is all exposition and almost no plot. There were so many amazing conspiracy films in the 70's, its disconcerting that a movie can be this weak and people gave it four and five star reviews. The plot is almost non-existent, almost nothing happens. Its like if you took people to a fancy looking restaurant with high prices but crappy food, and they think they were served great food simply because of the atmosphere and prices. Its disconcerting to me that so many amazon reviewers wrote good reviews. The professional reviewers saw right this piece of useless nonsense and gave it terrible reviews. By any measure, its a terrible movie to anyone with any discernment. I gave it two stars only because it features a great soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith (most famous for his soundtrack for ""Planet of the Apes"") who has done many amazing soundtracks.

1191663,4,B0000066CQ,"Did you hear the one about Stanley Kubrick faking the moon landing for NASA?

In the 70's conspiracy theories exploded resulting in a variety of great (""The Parallax View"", ""Three Days of The Condor"") and writer-director Peter Hyams came up with a unique combination of science fiction and paranoid thriller. People as early as 1970 began to believe that the moon landing was faked and their evidence was the convincing visual effects of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" just two years before.

Working with elements of that Hyams concocted a solid thriller with a unique angle.

SPOILERS:

Astronauts Brubaker (James Brolin), Willis (Sam Waterston) and Walker (O.J. Simpson) are pulled from their space capsule just before launch to a mission to Mars. Dr. James Kelloway (Hal Holbrook) the director of the program explains that they discovered that the life support system would fail three weeks into their flight. He asks them to do the unthinkable: fake the landing on Mars because NASA is afraid that, if they cancel the mission that the funding will be cut because of their failure.

Things go from bad to worse as the automated space capsule disintegrates  on its return to Earth. All three astronauts have to go on the run because they are, for all intents and purposes, dead to the rest of the world.

END OF SPOILERS:

Featuring a terrific cast that includes Elliott Gould as a reporter trying to unravel what is going on, Brenda Vacarro, the late Telly Savalas and the late Karen Black in supporting roles, ""Capricorn One"" holds up remarkably well and remains entertaining particularly Waterston who plays an astronaut who always has a quip and a joke (Waterston accepted the role because he had been playing such serious roles and wanted to play someone who was a joker).

The Blu-ray transfer looks decent and is an improvement over the earlier DVD but it's hardly a top tier transfer. This probably has more to do with the film itself. The interpositive used for the transfer was close to pristine looking. The transfer looks pretty decent. There's not a lot of depth to the image and the film looks soft at times but there are also moments of remarkable clarity and detail. The frustrating thing is that ""Capricorn One"" looks pretty darn good at times and then, the next shot is so-so.

 Having said all of that, I can recommend ""Capricorn One"". It's a fun conspiracy flick from a time when they really knew how to make them.

The audio is presented in stereo and, aside from occasional distortion during two key scenes  and in the dialog (it's not a problem with the transfer but with the original source) the rest of the time the soundtrack is remarkably clear with dynamics that compliment Jerry Goldsmith's musical score.

Unfortunately, we don't get any of the special features from the Lion's Gate UK release (it featured a vintage featurette and a commentary track among other special features). The only special features are a photo gallery and trailer. This also includes a DVD of the feature film as well.

The transfer is pretty decent, the sound is solid as well so it's a pity that Timeless Media didn't go for the gold and license the special features for the film.

Still, ""Capricorn One"" remains a fun paranoid suspense thriller.

CAPRICORN ONE: It seems that there are still a number of suspicious souls out there who honestly believe that all Americas moon shots were faked: that space travel proved impossible and that the moon landings never took place at all, but instead were staged for TV in a warehouse somewhere. Hyams took this legendary conspiracy theory and turned it into a simple adventure flick with no pretensions other than pure entertainment. But, as the script is filled with eminently logical explanations for every one of its outrageous ideas, it keeps us hooked on its virtual reality.

The paranoid/conspiracy mindset is brilliantly illustrated, not just in the set-up, but in the unraveling of the scheme as well. Hyams knows how to direct a suspense movie, and this one is filled with solid performances, as well as an unexpected highlight: Telly Savalas brief but hilarious appearance as the worlds most obnoxious man.",1423267200,,1168,4.835

1191810,1,B0000066CQ,"The story-a manned mission to Mars is launched, but before the spaceship takes off, the three astronauts aboard are abruptly and mysteriously pulled off and taken to a military base in the middle of a desert. The reason: the manufacturers of the ship's life support system cut too many corners and the system would have failed during the mission. Why not abort it then? Fear of the government cutting the funds for NASA. So the astronauts are compelled to participate in the faking of the Mars landing.

Problem one: the Moon landing program was meant largely as Cold War propaganda; ""See what the mighty USA can accomplish!"" (The Soviets had already sent the first man into space.) The Cold War still raged in the 1970's, and despite the bad economy, it was hardly likely that Congress would have elected to reduce NASA funding under any circumstances. More likely they would have just aborted this launch and repaired the problem. They certainly would have gone after the company that knowingly built the bad life support system. The Challenger disaster a decade later resulted in a public investigation.

Problem two: it was not just the public, but the NASA technicians who were fooled-all except one who got suspicious. When he tells his newspaper friend, he is made to disappear. Then the reporter's car is sabotaged (and he escapes unharmed), but somehow the local police couldn't find anything wrong with the car. Okay, this is going overboard. Even the most careful conspiracy leaves ""broken glass""-something that conspiracy theorists often ignore. Certainly not only people in NASA, but outside observers such as astronomers might not get suspicious of, say, lack of radio transmissions from Mars? And how does this spaceship launch itself back from Mars, anyway? Biggest hole of all.

There are other details, but those who find this movie convincing know only about space as in the space that their heads are full of.",1422144000,,1929,5.003115264797508

Here we are, millions of miles from Earth, and we can still send out for pizza!"" His line sums up not only the plot of the movie but its point.

In an ironic twist, this movie relates to what is going on right now on television news, and it was made 35 years ago! Capricorn One is not only about the lies behind what we see and what appear to be real through the media, it is about not always knowing the difference, not knowing that we, the public, are often presented with images that we often take for granted. We assume that TV news footage is accurate representations of the truth, when in reality, like movies, it may be sleight of hand. The images may have been manipulated to propagate a message that the broadcasters want to us hear that may be removed from our own interpretations. In short, viewer beware.

In Capricorn One, a fictional NASA is trying to create the impression that a legitimate mission to Mars is underway when in fact it is not. Three ""astronauts"" are hijacked by their own NASA employers and forced to make a bogus ""appearance"" on the planet Mars which is actually a sound stage in southern Texas. The reason? Because a ""bona fide American screw-up"" in which the company that contracted their life support systems delivered a defective product jeopardizes launching the mission as scheduled. Rather than scrubbing the mission which might lead to a cancellation of the entire space program, NASA launches a Watergate-like conspiracy to defraud both the public and the US government by staging a flight and landing on Mars much like a Hollywood movie. ""...we have no more program. What's sixteen years? Your actual drop in the bucket,"" Hal Holbrook laments to the crew as he rationalizes the need for the hoax. He later states that America will lose its ideals if the space program gets canceled, therefore lying will help keep America good and strong.

At the launch, a congressman goes head-to-head with the vice-president. What is left unspoken is as telling as what is spoken.

Elliott Gould, a marginal reporter sometimes referred to as ""Scoop Caulfield"", begins to suspect something is amiss when a friend of his who works for NASA disappears from a pool game at a bar. He looks for him at his friend's apartment the next day and, to his dismay, a strange woman is living there and all the furniture has been changed. Even the magazines on the table have her name on them, not his friend's. His friend's identity appears to have been wiped out of existence. Later, a strange discourse between Brubaker, the head astronaut, and his wife during a televised communication between the astronauts and their wives further whets his thirsty curiosity.

The film then chronicles three intertwined stories: the astronauts and the hoax, Caulfield's investigation, and Brubaker's wife and children. Eventually, the three stories come together in a frenzy concerning what is truth and what isn't and who ultimately knows the truth.",1421539200,,3106,4.8198874296435275

""If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.""
-Rene Descartes

Though the subject of this movie is interesting, the movie itself is boring. I watched it once and put it away never to be watched again.  There, now that that's out of the way lets talk about the moon landing.
  I would just like to offer you a few observations. 1. We have no verifiable evidence for the moon landing ( pictures and film easily produced by the Hollywood of 1969, Moon rock more plausibly acquired as meteors right here on Earth, and the testimony of government employees ). 2. The Soviets and Chinese were unable to even get a monkey through the VanAllen Belt in 45 years, forget about putting their own man on the moon. Good science is verifiable and reproducible. The moon landing is neither. Think about it.

Incidentally, I've never seen Capricorn One once on television in my life. Has it been suppressed? If so, why?

If you happen to be one of the millions of people who believe that the Moon landings were real, as I did for most of my life, here's some food for thought...

""Logic, therefore, as the science of thought, or the science of the process of pure reason, should be capable of being constructed a priori.""
-Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Controversy (""a priori"" is defined as deduced from self-evident premises)

""Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.""
-George Orwell, 1984

Formal/Classical Logic was invented by Aristotle in ancient Greece (circa 350 B.C.). It is a remarkably versatile and effective system of ""rules for reasoning"" that anyone can use to good effect. Devised as a systematic method of evaluating evidence and language arguments to (1) insure correct reasoning within the limitations of the existing evidence, and (2) effectively reveal erroneous or deceptive reasoning, it was soon to govern and define the measured thought of the leading rulers and intellectuals of the ancient world. Alexander the Great was only the first of a very long line of adherents of formal logic that would dramatically alter the course of history. To this very day, utilized in virtually every field that requires accurate and objective reasoning from archaeology, astronomy and medicine, to law, politics and war, more so than any other intellectual tool, formal logic has been responsible for laying the foundations of our civilization. Curiously, formal logic contains one common historical thread that has always been true. Niether the ancient Greeks, nor the Romans, nor the old antbellum American South ever considered it wise to teach formal/classical logic to common slaves, for obvious reasons. The teaching of Classical logic was removed from the U.S. public school system over 150 years ago, and has been systematically suppressed by our media for exactly the same reasons (""The Underground History of American Education"" by John Gatto, his ""Ultimate History Lesson"" on YouTube, ""The Lost Tools of Learning"" by Dorothy Sayers, ""The Prussian School System"", and ""Operant Conditioning"", all online).
If you doubt this just ask some average U.S. high school graduates sometime to tell you the difference between a ""formal"" and an ""informal"" logical fallacy; or, how to determine if an argument is both ""valid"" and ""sound"" (i.e., very basic and essential knowledge of formal logic). You'll find that they have no idea. The vast majority couldn't even tell you the difference between ""deductive"" and ""inductive"" reasoning. As you will soon see, this is no accident. The following is a concise and effective method of using formal logic and is the essence of that ancient system of reasoning (adapted from a definition given in Howard Kahane' s book ""Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric"", 1976).

""All instruction given or received by way of argument proceeds from preexistent knowledge.""
-Aristotle, Posterior Analytics

""We ought in fairness to fight our case with no help beyond the bare facts: nothing, therefore, should matter except the proof of those facts.""
-Aristotle, Rhetoric

Cogent (logical) reasoning, reasoning designed to strongly appeal to the intellect rather than the emotions, should meet 3 conditions:
1. It must be derived from premises that ""you know"" are true. (These are true propositions that are either; (a) ""self-evident""; (b) verified by your own personal direct experience; or (c) well supported by solid verifiable evidence. There is no fourth way to ""know"" that a premise is true.).
2. It should contain all of the known relevant evidence. (The suppression, or improbable absence, of relevant evidence is a good indication of deception. Relevant evidence is any evidence that would tend to make an argument more likely or less likely to be true.)
3. It should be properly structured, so that it comes to a conclusion which logically follows from the premises. (In the case of valid deductive arguments this conclusion would ""necessarily"" follows from the premises. In the case of very strong inductive arguments it would follow ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". In both cases it would be free of contradiction and consistent with the facts.)

When an argument meets these conditions (ie. verifiably true premises, all relevant evidence, and properly structured) it is said to be sound or cogent, and very likely to be true. When an argument does not meet these conditions it is said to be fallacious (faulty/deceptive reasoning).

""Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four.""
-George Orwell, 1984

""The province of Logic must be restricted to that portion of our knowledge which consists of inferences from truths previously known; whether those antecedent data be general propositions, or particular observations and perceptions. Logic is not the science of Belief, but the science of Proof, or Evidence. In so far as belief professes to be founded on proof, the office of Logic is to supply a test for ascertaining whether or not the belief is well grounded.""
- John Stuart Mill, A System of Logic

""Aristotle devides all conclusions into logical and dialectical, in the manner described, and then into eristical. (3) Eristic is the method by which the form of the conclusion is correct, but the premises, the material from which it is drawn, are not true, but only appear to be true. Finally (4) sophistic is the method in which the form of the conclusion is false, although it seems correct. These three last properly belong to the art of Controversial Dialectic, as they have no objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and pay no regard to truth itself; that is to say, they aim at victory.""
-Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Controversy

(Very helpful in analyzing the relationship between premises and conclusion is the following taken from the book ""Logic and Rhetoric"" [1968] by James Johnston. ""The hypothesis most likely to prove right must do the following: 1. Include all known facts; 2. Not over-emphasize any part of the evidence at the expense of the rest; 3. Observe the laws of probability as established by previous investigation; 4. Avoid logical contradictions; 5. Stay as simple as possible without ignoring any part of the evidence. Hypotheses which violate any one of these requirements are Forced Hypotheses."")

""To know what you know and to know what you do not know. That is true knowledge.""
-Confucius

""Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns  the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.
-Former United States Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld at a press conference Febuary 12, 2002

Two years later Rumsfeld offers us a ""fourth kind"" of knowledge about which people who would one day like ""free"" systems of government to actually exist should be keenly interested.

""Febuary 4th, 2004
Subject: What you know
There are known knowns.
There are known unknowns.
There are unknown unknowns.
But there are also unkown knowns. That is to say, things that you think you know, that it turns out you did not.""
-Donald Rumsfeld, from the Errol Morris documentary ""Unkown Knowns""

Here's what Donald Rumsfeld won't say.
An effective understanding of classical logic is indispensable in the identification of ""unknown knowns"". That is why it has been suppressed.

""Beware of false knowledge; it is more dangerous than ignorance.""
-George Bernard Shaw

Now, on to a bit of rhetoric with the informal logical fallacy:

""Rhetoric is the art of ruling the minds of men.""
-Plato

Professor Madsen Pirie most aptly defines a logical fallacy as anything one can say or do that breaks down or subverts reason. The ancient Greeks discovered over 200 different logical fallacies. Here are some commonly used ""informal"" logical fallacies taken from the book ""The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric"" by Sister Miriam Joseph Ph. D..(In his book ""Logic For Lawyers"" Ruggero Aldisert defines the formal logical fallacy as an ""error in the logical form of an argument"" and informal logical fallacies as those that ""deal with the content and context of premises."" When an argument meets the three conditions of cogent reasoning it does not contain any formal logical fallacies.)

""ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM
Argumentum ad hominem ( literally, an ""argument to the man"") fallacy confuses the point at issue with the people concerned. Attacks on the character and conduct of people and personal abuse or praise are substituted for reasoning on the point at issue. Argumentum ad hominem seeks to persuade by unsound ethos. In rhetoric ethos means establishing the speaker or writer as one worthy of making an argument.""

""ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM
The argumentum ad populum fallacy arises from substituting an appeal to the passions and prejudices of the people for logical reasoning on the point at issue...""

""ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM
The argumentum ad misericordiam (literally, an ""argument to pity"") fallacy replaces reason with a plea for sympathy.""

""ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM
Argumentum ad baculum is the appeal to the ""big stick."" The issue is ignored in an attempt to inspire fear of the consequences of adopting a proposed opinion or program, or of allowing a movement branded as dangerous to gain strength. The threat of social ostracism or loss of position might be used to deter a person from exposing fraud...""

""ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIAM
Argumentum ad ignorantiam is the use of an argument that sounds convincing to others because they are ignorant of the weaknesses of the argument and of the facts that stand against it.""

ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM
Argumentum ad verecundiam is an appeal to the prestige or respect in which a proponent of an argument is held as a guarantee of the truth of the argument. This is unwarranted when reasoning about an issue is required and only the authority of its upholders or opponents is given consideration. It is perfectly legitimate to supplement reasoning with authority (Argumentum ad auctoritatem ), but it is fallacious to substitute authority for reasoning in matters capable of being understood by reason.""

A very helpful tool in understanding effective rhetoric is Aristotle's three primary pillars of persuasion; (1) Ethos (authority), (2) Pathos (emotion), and (3) Logos (logic). To believe an argument that is supported by Ethos alone is to be manipulated by authority. To believe an argument that it is supported by Pathos alone is to be manipulated through emotion. Aristotle advises rather, that we take great pains to avoid being manipulated, and allow ourselves to be only truly persuaded by logos (i.e., logical arguments that are correctly reasoned and well supported by evidence).

CONCLUSION
Therefore, when testing ""any"" argument one should ask if the three conditions of cogent reasoning have been met and if logical fallacies have been used.

""We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; The real a tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.""

1191905,4,B0000066CQ,"Originally released in 1978, Capricorn One has the first manned mission to Mars on the launchpad. Just minutes before launch, the three astronauts are removed from the spacecraft and flown to an abandoned military base in the desert. Unbeknownst to the world, the spacecraft is launched without a crew. A NASA director tells the astronauts that a defective life support system would have killed them within weeks. He explains how NASA feels that a major screw-up would have been bad for the space program and instead decided to fake the whole mission. The astronauts are told their families are threatened if they do not cooperate and go ahead with filming faked television transmissions from Mars. However, when the real (but empty) spacecraft returns to Earth and unexpectedly burns up during re-entry, the world thinks the astronauts are dead...

The film is based on the conspiracy theories that the real-life Apollo Moon landings were faked and, in part, helped to proliferate the idea. While I shudder to think that this film would convince people of that, I still found this to be a quite enjoyable piece of entertainment. There are some really great pieces of dialogue in the film and many interesting sequences. It is not without its flaws. There are some pretty big plot holes, mostly regarding the logic used to pull the hoax, and some really stupid pieces of dialogue, but if you put those in the back of your mind for two hours, the film can be enjoyed.",1358467200,,1466,4.864

I saw this movie in 1978, and absolutely loved it; watching it again did not disappoint in any way. It's edge-of-your-seat exciting from start to finish. Elliot Gould is perfectly cast as a reporter who suspects foul play, James Brolin plays a likable astronaut, and Hal Holbrook is unforgettable as the sinister mastermind behind the hoax. The desert photography is impressive as is the Jerry Goldsmith score.

It should be done in Blu Ray but that probably isn't possible since the movie is so old.  I saw it at the theater when it first came out and I loved the back-and-forth between the characters.  Hal Holbrook was at his malevolent best in this one, and the scene where Elliot Gould hired crusty old crop duster Telly Savalas to fly him around looking for James Brolin has some of the most humorous dialogue ever.

1191922,4,B0000066CQ,"I saw Capricorn One(released June/78)in its debut year,at a drive-in no less(remember those?),and I liked it then. After viewing it after all these years,I can safely say I STILL like it. It stars a great cast including:Elliott Gould as Robert Caulfield,James Brolin as Colonel Charles Brubaker, USAF,Sam Waterston as Lieutenant Colonel Peter Willis, USAF,O. J. Simpson as Commander John Walker, USN,Hal Holbrook as Dr. James Kelloway,Brenda Vaccaro as Kay Brubaker,Karen Black as Judy Drinkwater,David Doyle as Walter Loughlin,Robert Walden as Elliot Whitter,Telly Savalas as Albain,James Karen as Vice President Price,David Huddleston as Congressman Hollis Peaker and others. The film was deftly helmed by Peter Hyams,who was in his salad says as a director. The film's speculative but very intriguing plot,about whether a manned mission to Mars was faked,rings ever more true today in light of the fact that we can do even more now technologically speaking,than we could have then. Would it ever be done?Well that is the $64,000,000 question,isn't it?There are some that say the robotic missions to Mars now are fakes. Conspiracy theorists have always been around,as they were back then in the 70s(and before).The Moon landings were still fresh in everyone's minds,and some thought even then they had been faked. MANY average folks thought(and still do)that the assassination of Pres. Kennedy in /63 didn't go down as said. Then came the successive proven lies from Pres. Johnson and Nixon about the Vietnam War. So a movie about a government controlled faking of a Mars mission,was not as kooky as it sounded for 70s audiences. And with the internet as it is today,these kind of older conspiracy theories are tame.
The plot involves a group of three astronauts who are on board to fly to Mars(Brolin,Simpson and Waterson).The start goes off like clockwork,as the three sit inside the command module awaiting lift off. Suddenly the hatch is thrown open and the three are asked to exit the spacecraft. They are swept away to a secret location and briefed by one of the heads of the project,Holbrook. He explains that the government is losing patience with the program and any screw up(of which there has been a few)would mean the death knell for NASA.He also explains the public has lost interest in the program and they need to breathe some new life into it;and this is their chance to do so. Brolin balks at cooperating but it soon becomes apparent that it is not a request but a demand. Their families very lives are at stake if they should refuse.
The spacecraft did launch as scheduled but an intricate system of fake voices,medical readings and vector tracking was immediately put into place. The astronauts are secured in an old air base hangar where a replica of the command module,landing spacecraft and ""Martian"" landscape have been recreated. When a broadcast from the ""space capsule"" comes,the men reluctantly play along,as is their monumental broadcast of their walks on Mars. When it is over they are sequestered away. They realize they are most likely,in reality and as far as the public is concerned,going to be killed off. They are right,as the space module,during its' fake re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere,seemingly loses its heat shield and they all""perish"".A news conference to that effect is given by Holbrook. The men don't sit around and wait for the inevitable,so they decide to make a run for it. They escape the facility and fly a Lear jet away from the base. They seem to be in the clear when the jet's fuel gauge registers extremely low. The are forced to belly land in the desert. Each take a flare(to signal in case they fail to reach help),and they head in separate directions,east,west and south.
In the meantime,a friend of newspaper reporter Gould,who worked at NASA during the launch,has disappeared completely. Now Gould himself is being stalked by persons unknown who mean him harm. He is almost drowned,shot at and incarcerated on a set up drug charge. When released he decides to go out to a remote desert airport and hire a bi-plane,flown by Savalas.
Back on the ground,two of the astronauts have been apprehended and Brolin is the last alone. He hides away in a remote gas station he stumbles onto,but government helicopters soon find him,along with reporter Gould in his plane. They manage to pick up Brolin,who clings precariously to one of the plane's wings. They dodge and weave the helicopters who are in pursuit,and eventually dispatch both. The film ends as the official joint funeral,with the President presiding,suddenly has two unlikely visitors emerge out of a car and run towards them:Gould and Brolin.
The good guys win this one,as they should have. The average viewer needed to think that the public could win at least sometimes against the government;especially in this case as they were literally getting away with murder. The script is an intelligent one and the monologue by Holbrook as he initially tries to explain and coerce the astronauts into doing as he asks for altruistic reasons,certainly had alot of truths in it. One such truth was the world's lack of enthusiasm for the Apollo series of flights to the moon,especially after Apollo 12. Getting there by then was a routine thing. NASA DID need a shot in the arm and a mission to Mars would have been the natural next step,which there was talk of,but it never happened. As we all know NASA's budget was incrementally slashed from those days to now. It seemed the dreaming went out of NASA,as did those of the public who intially hung on its every launch and flight. Holbrook asks how much are dreams worth? The bigger question is why did we stop there? We could have easily been to Mars by now had we continued. These controversial issues and more are raised by this film.
Hyams adds some neat touches,like the small government helicopters who seem to take on a life of their own,as at one point they seemingly face each other,turn and fly off in tandem. The only faux paux I could see off hand was calling the landing craft a LEM.LEM stood for Lunar(as in Moon)Excursion Module,not what a Mars lander would be called(a MEM maybe?).The landing craft we see at the hangar though was an exact replica of the LEM that landed on the moon alright,as was the Apollo command module.
Technically speaking this film is in its w/a a/r of 2:35:1 and is a marvellous print of this film,generally clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,the trailer and a featurette.
All in all a well crafted thriller/drama from the 70s,filled with conspiracy and ominous government intervention,about a mission to Mars that is nothing of the kind. The cast is totally solid and if you can believe that this could happen,then the film has you. 4- 4 1/2 stars.",1351900800,,6758,4.944591029023747

1191926,3,B0000066CQ,"As a conspiracy movie this film was fine earning about three stars for execution, except for the following personal technical objections:

1) No government backed intelligence agency is stupid enough to enter into a vast conspiracy for the stated reasons.  NASA would have upon learning of the deficiency in the life support system simply put off the mission and not entered into this crazy scheme.  This system would also have been qualification tested years in advance.

2) The movie made no allowance for the needed time-line of a mission to mars (say 7 months out and 7 months back give or take + residence time on mars). Nothing like the time line presented in the film.

3) The crew was supposed to have traveled in the Saturn-V, Apollo Style Command & Service Modules and Lunar Excursion Modules to Mars?  OK, just a small fact everybody knows, that stack just can't make the trip, not by a long shot.

I know, it is just a film and give it a little slack, but I just can't give any slack to a film that advances anything like the idea that Apollo was actually a conspiracy. It is just plain silly, and so was this film.

By the way, if this crazy plot actually took place, Elliot Gould would never have made it to the funeral with one of the three ""missing"" astronauts.  Nice try Hollywood. Keep your plots plausible concerning events of enough import to make a conspiracy necessary in the first place.

1191929,5,B0000066CQ,"This is a long-waited DVD if you ask me.  Deffenitely.  I think the audio and video qualities of this DVD are much better than previously released VHS videos or LDs.  It is recorded and presented with a wide-screen or a letter-boxed, a high 16:9 aspect ratio picture, together with multiple audios and subtittles.  This DVD packege also includes some newly produced supplimental-interviews with the  writer/director Peter Hyams and other staff members and/or specialists who worked on the film.  Above all, I'd like to point out the fact that it gives us one good audio commentary we can enjoy: that is, the director's audio commentaries. They say that it is very reare for the film's director Peter Hyams to review or make any kind of comments on the movie he produced/wrote/filmed/directed.  He himself was saying he had never commented or recorded them on his picture after they were completed and released because there would have been anything for him to alter or change once they left him.  So, watching and listening to his or others' commentaries themselves worth purchasing this DVD.  Jerry Goldsmith'd famous opening theme music is one another highlight to make this movie even more dramatic and gorgeous.  And its ending; WARNING: I might reveal an important or crucial scene of the movie as the following:  Everytime I see that red Dutsun 280Z sports car, approaching silently form the far-background toward us in the middle of surpposed-to-be a very sad ocassion/situation in the final scene of the movie, I couldn' help myself shedding some tears from my eyes with a joy or rejoyce.  Oh,one more thing to note: Yes, I deffinitely agree with the director's the point  in which he believes this was probably the first mortion picture to feature two flying helicopters as human-like figures, pretending they were talking and nodding face to face each other.  Those made my nerves chilled.  I strongly recomemd to buy this DVD and re-experience the Capricorn incident happened in the late '70s again for yourself.  Now, I'd like all of you who have read this review to show your enthusiasms by saying / declaring either 'GOs' or 'No-Gos.'  All right.

1191941,4,B0000066CQ,"While he was working at CBS News and viewing footage of Apollo astronauts walking on the moon, Peter Hyams was inspired to come up with a story about a team of astronauts who fake a mission to Mars.  The resultant movie, ""Capricorn One"", is a great conspiracy film that has provided fodder for those who believe that we never went to the moon.

The all-star cast is actually pretty good in this film, led by James Brolin as Capricorn One mission commander Charles Brubaker, Hal Holbrook as Capricorn One mission director Dr. James Kelloway, and Elliott Gould as crack Houston newspaper reporter Robert Caulfield.  Along for the ride are a pre-""Law & Order"" Sam Waterston as astronaut Peter Willis, Robert Walden (at that time starring on ""Lou Grant"") as astute flight controller Elliot Whitter, O.J. Simpson (at the tail end of his football career) as astronaut John Walker, and Brenda Vaccaro (fresh off ""Airport '77"") as faithful astronaut wife Kay Brubaker.

The story itself is simple enough - the life support system on board Capricorn One, the Apollo-era spacecraft tasked with getting three men to Mars, doesn't work.  Thinking that this will prompt Congress to kill the space program, Kelloway takes a desperate gamble by removing the men from the spacecraft just before launch and filling them in on the problem.  Under threat of harm to their families, the three astronauts go along with Kelloway and fake the mission.  All goes well until the real spacecraft, which has been to Mars and back, burns up on re-entry.  The astronauts, then, become desperate men, trying to find their way back home and tell the world what's happened.

There are plot holes galore in this movie - the use of Apollo-era technology to get to Mars; the fact that none of the three astronauts knew of the life-support system problems beforehand; and the fact that they were only supposed to be gone less than one year on a trip that takes about twice that long.  But what makes ""Capricorn One"" so good is the fact that it takes a great what-if and builds upon it.  There are many people who didn't believe Americans landed on the moon before ""Capricorn One"" came out.  This movie helped fan that flame.  It looks dated now, of course, and some of the special effects are a little obvious - one scene in which an airplane hits a car on a runway is particularly telling - but ""Capricorn One"" is a guilty pleasure that is still a joy to watch.  And the main theme by Jerry Goldsmith is a fine cut of music - one of my favorite movie themes.",1336608000,,2523,4.665914221218961
1191942,4,B0000066CQ,"It took me a while to get into this movie. I hadn't watched a combination conspiracy theory / science-fiction movie in some time, and I started to be disappointed, but after a bit the plot and the action picked up and I found this to be a pretty entertaining movie. For those who argue that the plot is unbelievable... well, I'd just like to point out that the American people have been deceived many times. And it only gets easier as time goes by, what with technology getting ""better"" and allowing unscrupulous people to do whatever they want. (I like to think they all get caught, eventually. It's hard not to leave a paper trail. Or electronic trail.) I don't know what I would have thought if I had been around at the time of the moon landing. Likely I would have been skeptical, but I probably would have just taken it at face value and assumed it was true. Today, half of what we see on screen is CGI, so would I believe a Mars landing today?

There were problems with the movie, of course, like the reporter's car inexplicably speeding up to 100 mph just because his brakes went out. He really should have been able to steer into the grass somewhere and stop. But I guess that wouldn't have been nearly as exciting! *SPOILER ALERT* I enjoyed the end of the movie. A nice helicopter chase scene that would totally be overdone today. It was unbelievable that the astronaut would have been able to hold on to the outside of the plane through some of those fancy moves, but besides that it was great, because everything in a movie today would have been faked. The crop duster's way of defeating the armed helicopters was so simple, yet so fun. The helicopters crashing into the mountains was exciting, yet not a huge CGI fireball that lasted 25 seconds. In other words, realistic.

While it kept the premise of space travel,launched on Saturn 5 Rockets and in 1979, even James Bond went to space on a shuttle craft,still the prospect of a trip to mars is way out there ,since no current propulsion systems can do so in a short period of time, it will seem impossible. The Zero-X, a wild concoction of a space craft took Marionette men to Mars in Captain Scarlet and it was more believeable. Aside all that, the cast held up well, even O.J. and the story line keeps your attention during a heated chase across 3 points of the compass ,across all places, a desert. When our three astronauts decide to escape, after thier families watch in horror of the failure of a heat shield, during re-entry and NASA writes them off, it's expected but not really known, that the plane they stole runs out of fuel during flight. This boosted careers for O.J. Simpson and even Law & Order's ADA, Sam Waterson cracking wise and telling sarcastic jokes during the film. Brolin was on his way with his career as well and eventually lives to tell the story of NASA, which stands for Need Another Space Agency, when they go from idolizing astronauts as explorers to killing them just to cover up a secret. Hal Holbrook portrayed his 70's style of a liar, authority type who lies to the astronauts about a life support system that would fail them but wants to cover it up so the program will stay, he was always good at this languished dead pan style of breaking news to others. Karen Black' s role as the sanctimonious, sufragette woman reporter, babbling idiotic, typed out lines, like a robot,when she is within arms length of Elliot Gould, what was she trying to prove? Her parts were short and basically worthless, she did better in Airport 1975 where she did something constructive, like fly a 747 and try to save 120 passengers. Even Telly Savalas got his worth in this movie because everyone who was trying to get him and the contents of his crop duster was dubbed ""Perverts"" by our 1970's NY Detective ,turned pilot. In the end, at the funeral the truth does come out, this film was good even to watch now a days, just for a trip back in time.",1326153600,,2504,4.591517857142857
1191947,4,B0000066CQ,"Capricorn One(1978) is a suspense-thriller directed by Peter Hyams(Outland, 2010, End of Days, The Musketeer). The film satirizes the cynicism and feelings of paranoia during the 1970's. There are conspiracy theories that the Moon Landing in 1969 never really happened. That was spoofed in the James Bond movie Diamonds are Forever(1971) as a visual gag. Three astronauts(James Brolin, O.J. Simpson, and Sam Waterston) are forced by the US Government to participate in a phony mission to Mars filmed on a soundstage. When the astronauts are ordered to be killed off, they escape from a soundstage in the desert and they try to inform the public about the conspiracy. A reporter played by Elliot Gould and a crop duster played by Telly Savalas try to help the astronauts. Capricorn One suffers from a far fetched plot, but it is entertaining. There are some well-crafted action scenes and a superb music score by Jerry Goldsmith. Stock music from this film was used in the kung fu film Blind Fist of Bruce(1981). Director Peter Hyams may have been a fan of Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick. There are scenes that echo The Lady Vanishes, North by Northwest, Family Plot, and Dr. Strangelove. The Lionsgate DVD has a commentary track from director Peter Hyams. He claims women at the 1978 screening screamed during the POV shot of Elliot Gould losing control of his car! I guess the film is more intense on a giant movie theater screen. The gas station in the desert was a set built by the producers. The 2008 DVD version of Capricorn One is blessed with a clean, digitally restored and remastered print. Capricorn One(1978) is a fun, suspenseful, solid film.",1324598400,,1660,4.911032028469751

1191949,1,B0000066CQ,"One of the worst films I've ever seen, 24 September 2011

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Watching this once was enough to convince me that a donation of the DVD to the library was a splendid idea. This film had one of the very worst scripts and dialogues that made me squirm from beginning to the end. A highlight of awful dialogue was the back and forth banter between Karen Black and Elliot Gould where they would repeat ""wanna jump me"" or some variant of this, trying hard to talk dirty but sounding like they were describing the air temperature. O.J. only has a few lines, thank goodness and the very first thing he says, after many scenes of him looking all artificially peeved is ""I think I want to throw up"", which pretty much sums up the feeling I had at the end of the film. When I think of it now, this film reminds me of some of the very popular (but now unwatchable) 70's television shows like the Six Million Dollar Man.

For the life of me, the many people who have expressed their opinions here about how terrific and exciting this film is I cannot speak to the low level of taste so many of you must have or your complete lack of knowledge of what makes a cracker-jack good plot, snappy dialogue or semi-believable premise. None of this is here. The writer/director should have stuck to journalism where his talents would be best utilized. In terms of atrocious films this one sits, for me, in the basement with ""Joe"" (Susan Sarandon's debut) and ""Highlander"". There are zero redeeming qualities to this stinker. Even the Jerry Goldsmith music is the worst of his entire output. I always come back to comparing films like this to masterpieces like ""2001 A.S.O."" and ""Apollo 13"". Even ""Silent Running"" is miles above this in story telling strength. Completely bad film.",1316822400,,1795,4.568322981366459

1191967,5,B0000066CQ,"I saw this in the theater in 1978, and in later years bought it on VHS, then laserdisc, then DVD.

I could never get the DVD to play in the proper aspect ratio on my new Plasma TV unless I played it in ""windowbox"" format.  It irritated me.

Finally I stumbled upon this 2008 Special Edition (which I didn't know existed until January 2011).  This version has a cleaner picture, plays in proper aspect ratio on my widescreen TV, and has a very enjoyable Director's Commentary.

The premise and execution of this film might seem a bit dated and hokey to contemporary audiences, but this film was a product of the 1970's American cynicism and mistrust of the government, and it was VERY relevant in its day.

It is still my favorite Peter Hyams movie  (with ""Narrow Margin"" running a very close second) and for me it holds up well 32+ years after its release.

If you are wanting to buy this movie, pick up the 2008 Special Edition for its enhanced widescreen presentation and bonus content.  There is a movie-only Blu-ray edition that was released in the UK (and maybe Canada), but I'm told the picture quality isn't enough improved to justify the expense.

In the Director's Commentary, Hyams readily admits that this film is not and was not intended to be all that plausible.  But the concept was a fun idea and came on the heels of a period in our history when we were tired of being lied to by our government (sounds familiar, eh?).

It is meant to be entertainment, first and foremost.  To pick it apart for its implausibility is to miss the point.

A fun drinking game to play when watching it is to count the number of Barbra Streisand husbands and ex-husbands in the cast.

O.J. Simpson has a supporting role (with few lines) in this film.  At one point during a scene where's he walking through the desert, I could swear I heard him say ""I'd KILL for a drink of water"".",1296259200,,1876,4.473529411764706

1191969,3,B0000066CQ,"It's fun to scoff at ""Capricorn One,"" the fondly remembered 1977 sci-fi conspiracy thriller detailing a fake Mars landing. I first saw this lovable mess as a kid and was convinced it was the best film of the year. Time and maturity have worn down my admiration, but it's a well-packaged rollercoaster with surprisingly good performances. The ultimate key to ""Capricorn One"" is its pace, galloping with such breath-taking speed one never has a chance to question the screenplay's numerous implausibilities. With just a few tweaks, it could have been an interesting statement on modern cynicism, corruption and politics.

Writer and director Peter Hyams forged a sturdy career during this period with well-cast thrillers, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outland/dp/B0019BI1DM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outland</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Star-Chamber/dp/B0006Z2NQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Star Chamber</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2010-The-Year-We-Make-Contact-Blu-ray/dp/B001993Y1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2010: The Year We Make Contact [Blu-ray</a>]. While he never made a truly great film, I always left the theater feeling my dollar was well spent. ""Capricorn One"" is where he first made his mark (he had previously directed the unheralded cop flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Busting-VHS/dp/6303092039/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Busting [VHS</a>] in 1974), and it's a box office-appealing actioner with a crackerjack conclusion.

The first-ever flight to Mars is in the midst of countdown before the astronauts (James Brolin, Sam Waterson and O.J. Simpson) are secretly carted off to a desolate military base. In a great piece of acting by the incomparable Hal Holbrook, they are told they must fake the mission in order to save NASA. Led into a huge warehouse, the astronauts view a hastily constructed television set complete with artificial Mars landscape. Holbrook uneasily reveals they must participate or have their families killed. Grudgingly, the astronauts take part in the deception only to realize they are expendable. In the meantime, scruffy, coffee-slurping reporter Robert Caulfield (Elliott Gould), in-between attempts to seduce fellow reporter Judy Drinkwater (Karen Black), begins to suspect a conspiracy and tries to crack the case with nothing more than a felt marker and Mapsco.

I can't begin to count the numerous problems I have with Hyams' script, including Holbrook's magical appearance at the remote military base during takeoff, the astronauts' eventual escape from the base without a guard in sight, the wildly inefficient attempts upon Gould's life and, ultimately, Gould hiring a pilot to search for the astronauts. Certainly he suspected the Mars flight was fake, but how did he know the necessity of searching the desert surrounding the base? He didn't, but then we would not have had the extraordinary scenes of the crop duster (piloted by a colorful Telly Savalas) attempting to escape the meager though ominous government helicopters.

Oh well, what I love about ""Capricorn One"" is the terrific dialog, notably between the senator (David Huddleston) and vice president (James Karen) at the beginning of the film. Gould's interviews with an astronaut's wife (Brenda Vaccaro) are well done, not to mention his hilarious conversations with his editor (David Doyle in fine form). Waterson's dry wisecracks make me laugh to this day and Holbrook's amazing speech about the difficulties of keeping the space program relevant is one of his finest moments of acting. All of the cast members give skilled performances. An added note must be made about Jerry Goldsmith's ominous musical score (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capricorn-One/dp/B002IUNUMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capricorn One</a>), yet another solid example of a brilliant career.

The film begins with the sound of an announcement of a rocket launch. The Vice President attends. Then an emergency requires the astronauts to leave the space craft. Should we spend billions on outer space projects given the problems here on earth? [Who benefits?] Dr. Jim Calloway explains the changes made for economic reasons (and a defective product). Political needs required this. The families are hostages for their good conduct! ""Thank you for bringing the problem to my attention."" There is a problem on Console #36. The video shows the landing on Mars! What will the astronauts do? What will that reporter do now that Elliot Witter has disappeared? What will happen if there is a malfunction on the space module upon re-entry?

The three astronauts make a successful escape. Was there a reason for low fuel on that jet plane? A pistol is part of the survival kit. They split up to survive. [Should they walk in the hot sun?] Robert Caulfield, the reporter, interviews Mrs. Brubaker. ""Trust me."" The search for the three men goes on. Caulfield learns about ""Flat Rock"", a recreated western town. Reporter Caulfield tells his manager about things. Will Federal Agents arrest him for narcotics possession? Will he be fired over this? Caulfield visits an abandoned Army base and finds a necklace. Will he find Brubaker alive? Can he rescue him from the pursuers and provide a dramatic ending?

This is a good story but has a weak ending. A film like this was only possible in post-Watergate America. I suggest this ending. The police capture the astronaut impersonator and the disgraced reporter and send them to a mental hospital for observation. They are soon forgotten.

The plot involves the proposed first manned landing on mars...however before the rocket is even launched the Nasa realises that the mission is doomed. In order to ensure that the 'space programme' funding is secure they convince the astronauts (played by James Brolin, Sam Waterson and yes...O.J Simpson) to participate in an elaborate hoax. So far so good...all goes to plan until months later on return to earth something goes wrong on re-entry... which means the 3 astronauts holed up in the desert are also doomed.

The film builds the suspense slowly and purposefully and although now it may seem somewhat dated...I'm sure at the time of release it played nicely into the hands of the 'conspiracy theorists'. Elliot Gould gives a good performance as the reporter who uncovers the hoax and persues the truth. Brenda Vaccarro gives a nicely modulated turn as one of the wives and there are cameo appearances by 70's stalwarts Telly Savalas and Karen Black.",1222387200,,1049,4.887640449438202

When it came out the Apollo missions were the state of the art space craft. So that's why these astronauts look so crammed together for the (impossibly long) mission to Mars. If they did a remake today, they would no doubt use something more like a shuttle with some room to exercise in!

That quibble aside, the premise behind Capricorn One's plot is believable: how an agenda-based government space program, struggling on a shrinking budget, tries to buffalo the public into believing in a faked mission to Mars, then the fallout over that botched attempt results in an action-packed ""escape"" plot of high entertainment. The cast is excellent: movie buffs will enjoy Telly Savalas, James Brolin and Elliot Gould at the peak of their careers, along with many others. Hal Holbrock plays an icy and very, very bad program director out to cover his kiester at any cost. It is perversely enjoyable to see O. J.

1192027,3,B0000066CQ,"There are many fans of the Conspiracy theory movies out there, and it's easy to see why. The very idea of there being a huge coverup or massive lie about something everybody accepts as truth just tantalizes the imagination. Capricorn One is one of those movies, and it takes it queues from the various conspiracy theories regarding the 1969 Apollo moon landing and puts a new face on it. As a sci-fi/government conspiracy movie it's a fascinating premise, but the movie doesn't go much further than that.

So the movie is about a manned mission to Mars that get's scrubbed due to a faulty life support system. NASA needs the launch to succeed in order to stay funded so they concoct a plan to fake the entire mission. The astronauts are coerced into going along with it and are detained during the length of the mission. Plans change and the government decides the astronauts must die in order to keep the hoax going. They escape while being chased by the government spooks. That pretty much covers it.

First off I want to say the story and how the plot unfolds is solid. No complaints there. Everything moves in a logical, intelligent, and extremely realistic pace. That is at least one feather in Capricorns cap. Some of the scenes impressed me with the amount of thought put into them like the astronauts' escape from captivity. The problem is there was the follow up on the later acts doesn't hit the same level. Once the ""action"" starts moving forward the movie runs a little less interesting, even if it still moves at a good pace. The acting was mostly dry, with the characters only having transparent personalities. Thats not to say there wasn't any good acting, just that there was no dynamic. The only character that really stands out in personality is a surly crop duster played by Telly Kojak Savalas. The scenes with Savalas are worth watching the movie alone. Also bear in mind when I say action it isn't the edge of your seat kind of visceral action. More like a milder chase scenes kind of action. No explosions or special effects to keep up any eye candy. Just straight camera shots.

This Blu-Ray release is technically a high definition (1080p) transfer, but it certainly doesn't look like it. The disc uses an older MPEG-2 codec (used mostly for DVDs) that is a good deal less efficient than your current high definition codecs like MPEG-4 and VC-1. There isn't much standing out on the visuals, and it feels more like a slightly upscaled DVD than a true high definition presentation. Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 and will not impress you. Then again the movie wasn't exactly recorded for dynamic sound anyway so no real loss there. There are no extras on this disc either. Just the movie.

All in all its not a bad movie. As a matter of fact I bet most of you government conspiracy buffs will really get into as it does that quite well. For those of you who have a short attention span you might not like it. Well. you might like the Savalas scenes. For the masses I recommend catching it on television or cable and see for yourself what I'm talking about. For me I find the lack of character development really hurts what could have been a well-rounded movie. Capricorn One: A decent meal but has no spice to it.

For those of you interested in buying the Blu-Ray I would wait. I heard rumor that Shout Factory has this movie on their sites, and plan on a release in the U.K. this summer. If they are releasing a Blu-Ray it will be a new transfer (some reports say from the original negatives) with better audio and even some extra features.

On the other hand, there is the propaganda of white male history which is the ""Dick and Jane"" version of reality which denies conspiracy in America.

What of the genocide of the native America?  The enslavement of Africans in America?  Our CIA run amuck all over the world?  Vietnam and today's Iraq-nam.  Warprofiteers aren't part of today's reality?  There is no Halliburton ripping off our soldiers?

O.J. Simpson, Sam Waterston and James Brolin are excellent as the three beleaguered astronauts who reluctantly go along with the conspiracy. I cannot think of a more diverse trio of actors to play these astronauts but they really make this film convincing. Elliott Gould as the reporter is perfectly cast bringing his best attributes to that role. Telly Savalas almost steals this film with a very colorful performance as an open cockpit pilot who helps Elliott Gould track down the astronauts while being chased by machine gun firing helicopters hot on his heels through curvaceous ravines.

1192044,2,B0000066CQ,"The concept is terrific:

A struggling NASA, faced with opponents in Congress and a bad track record, decides that it can't afford any more ""screwups"" as NASA head Hal Holbrook's character puts it. When it's discovered that corner cutting would result in a malfunctioning life support system that would leave a trio of astronauts, NASA's backers decide they'll fake the planned Mars landing to save the program. They ensure the astronauts will go along with it by claiming their families are aboard a single plane armed with a bomb which will be detonated if they don't play along.

Why the movie fails:
Plot holes you could drive a bus through.
**** SPOILERS AHEAD ****

Elliot Gould's reporter character has his car tampered with by the baddies resulting in no brakes and (somehow) a gas pedal that keeps pushing itself down(?!?) Despite speeds reaching 100 miles an hour, he manages to avoid running into another car or any other obstruction in busy traffic until reaching a boat bridge, which is opening as he reaches it (at 100MPH). Gould plunges into the water car and all and not only manages to escape drowning, but doesn't appear to be significantly hurt.

A chase scene late in the movie finds Brubaker clinging to the wing of a cropduster as he, Gould and a minor character are attacked by shooting helicopters. Brubaker manages to hang onto the plane's wing despite barrel rolls, dives and loop-de-loops as they try to evade the copters.

During the fake Mars landing, the astronauts don't ""bounce"" as they would in weaker gravity...they walk just like they would on Earth. Perhaps the script's writer believes we'll have ""weighted"" spacesuits by that point in time, but it isn't addressed in the script.

I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting but you get the point...too little attention spent on the actual script once the basic plot was arrived at.

I gave it two stars anyway because the action sequences ARE good to watch, but there's too much disbelief to suspend to really enjoy this one unless you're looking for a movie you can laugh at Mystery Science Theater 3000 style...",1172102400,,2098,4.859943977591036
1192045,4,B0000066CQ,"The 1970s were a time rife with left-wing conspiracy theories. Why not? The New Left hippie counterculture of the 1960s was just starting to settle down into ""real"" life, that dull drudgery of working every day for the man and paying bills so you can squirt out a couple of kids who'll soak up every spare dime you've got yet still hate you when they reach adolescence. Yay! To keep the experience real, the ex-hippies made sure to believe in every half-baked kook conspiracy that came down the pike. The conspiracy to kill JFK. The conspiracy to kill RFK. The conspiracy to kill MLK, Jr. Alien invaders. The evil goings on over at the CIA. J. Edgar Hoover in a dress. Anything was fair game for the acidheads. Heck, they're still up to their old tricks today with the hoodoo about global warming (Yeah, right. They said it'd ice over in the 1970s--if overpopulation didn't kill us off first) and the whole Election 2000 imbroglio. The election of George W. Bush and the concomitant misadventures in Iraq will provide conspiracy scenarios well into the middle of the century--or until the last Baby Boomer in the last pair of Depends coughs out their last breath.

All of this nonsense brings us to Peter Hyams's 1978 conspiracy thriller ""Capricorn One,"" a lesser entry in the 1970s ""paranoia will destroy ya"" subgenre. It's notable today for the presence of one O.J. Simpson, sans bloody glove and any knowledge that in roughly fifteen years he'll kill his ex-wife and her male companion. There might've been a white Bronco somewhere in the movie--I don't remember. What I do know is this: ""Capricorn One"" is an entertaining, if somewhat laughable jaunt, through the recesses of Hollywood paranoia, New Left fantasy, and Hal Holbrook's Mark Twain haircut. The plot, if you choose to accept it, deals with three astronauts--Colonel Charles Brubaker (James Brolin), Commander John Walker (Simpson), and Lt. Colonel Peter Willis (Sam Waterston)--and their sudden realization that the much anticipated trip to Mars ain't going to happen. Instead of disappointing the public, however, the government goes through the motions of a launch but stashes the astronauts away in an airplane hanger out in the desert. They plan on faking the Mars landing. The hanger has television cameras, a fake lander, a bogus landscape, and enough government secrecy to keep everything under wraps for years. Or maybe not.

Of course, some young shooter at mission control notices some glitch in the computer system that doesn't seem right. He properly notifies his superiors of the problem but is troubled when they don't seem that concerned. He mentions it in passing to his reporter friend Robert Caulfield (Elliot Gould). Caulfield doesn't think it's anything to get excited about until his buddy suddenly disappears without a trace, and bad things start happening to him. Like cops showing up at your apartment and finding drugs you didn't know you had in the bathroom, or driving your car down the road only to discover the brakes are suddenly nonexistent. These are the seminal markers of government conspiracy, and Caulfield (a true journalist/leftist/hero/ in the vein of Woodward and Bernstein) knows this. The rest of ""Capricorn One"" turns into a race between Caulfield on the one hand, doggedly trying to uncover the evil government conspiracy, and on the other hand the three astronauts trying to save their lives because certain developments suddenly make them think that the government might not want any witnesses around. Come to think of it, does the government ever want anyone around to witness its nefarious schemes and manipulations? Nah.

I noted that ""Capricorn One"" is a laughable jaunt, and it is. Elliot Gould is a hoot as the over the top reporter Caulfield. A throbbing forehead vein in human form, Gould's character chomps at the bit to prove the big bad government is pulling yet another sleazy scam. He screams at his boss, the man, and anyone that stands in his way. Only by posing heroically and running a lot can Caulfield get to the bottom of the faked Capricorn mission. It's unintentionally hilarious. I mean, the speeded up reels of his car careening through town without brakes evokes memories of the Keystone Kops, and the slow motion run with him and Brubaker at the end has to be one of the most feminine conclusions I've ever seen in a film. No wonder both of these chaps ended up married to Barbra Streisand. Yet the film does offer a few thrills (including a plane chase with Telly Savalas) and some good acting from Hal Holbrook as Dr. James Kelloway, a NASA scientist torn between his loyalties to the astronauts and his attachments to the space program. The movie has some good dialogue too, mostly seen in a monologue delivered by Holbrook at the beginning of the film.

The disc I watched ""Capricorn One"" on had zero in the way of supplements. No trailers, no commentary tracks, no behind the scenes footage, no deleted/extended scenes. No confession from O.J. Simpson, either. It's an all right film, worth a watch once maybe, but the whole idea is sort of outdated and laughable. How sinister is a conspiracy to hide the fact that we aren't landing on Mars? Not much today, but back during the Cold War the competition with the Soviet Union over who did what first in space had serious repercussions. If the Russians thought we put men on Mars, they'd also think our nuclear weapons technology was superior as well. So when viewed that way, ""Capricorn One"" has a certain cachet.  It also holds some allure, I'd imagine, for the nuts who think NASA faked the moon landings. And the two or three Elliot Gould fans.

1192048,5,B0000066CQ,"Capricorn One is a film that seems to have fallen out of favor over the years but it still holds up as one of the best 70s conspiracy thrillers even if it spends more time as a chase movie than it does on the nuts and bolts of exactly how to fake a space mission from a TV studio in Texas. The chronology also gets a little awkward in the second half as Elliot Gould's cynical reporter uncovers NASA's little game and suddenly finds his brakes tampered with and the feds planting drugs on him for his troubles - you can't help feeling that his suspicions should have been aroused a lot earlier to stop him putting the pieces together a little too quickly and conveniently while at the same time the three astronauts who are only co-operating because their families have been threatened (since O.J. is on the crew it must have been a 2-1 majority decision) and suddenly find themselves excess to requirements spend far too much time on the run in the desert. Not that the interest falters, especially as James Brolin has an increasingly tough time of it, finding himself a playground for scorpions and rattlesnakes while chased by the two most malevolent looking helicopters in screen history that become vividly vulture-like characters of their own. It's extraordinarily well directed by Peter Hyams with a remarkably strong visual sense he's long lost since becoming his own cinematographer and some superb crosscutting, and Jerry Goldsmith's superb driving score is among his very best.

1192050,4,B0000066CQ,"Capitalizing on the conspiracy-ridden films that proliferated during the 1970's, like ""All the President's Men,"" and ""Three Days of the Condor,"" Peter Hyams ""Capricorn One"" is certainly an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is engaging from start to finish.

Hal Holbrook, who I have never seen miscast in any film, is well-suited to the role as the corrupt NASA administrator determined to carry on with the fradulant mission to Mars who will stop at nothing--even at the cost of the astronauts' lives and those of their families.

James Brolin and Sam Waterson are both capable and convincing in their roles as two of the three astronauts who must fight for their lives once they've been coerced into faking their mission. Before OJ Simpson would occupy the municipal golf courses of suburban LA searching for the ""real killer"" of his estranged ex-wife and Ronald Goldman, ""The Juice"" managed to find cameo roles in lesser motion pictures like this one in the 70's.  As one of the doomed trio of astronauts, he brings little or nothing to the film.

The film's best scenes are dedicated to the chase sequences across the desert where the trio of astronauts must battle deadly government agents in black helicopters, poisonous snakes, and dehydration.

Elliot Gould is entertaining and capable as the reporter who risks his life breaking the story.  Where the film fails is in a lack of technical and scientific accuracy--why would NASA use a typical lunar lander and Saturn V rocket for a mission to Mars circa 1979? What was Warner Brothers thinking? (Ironically, the space agency was a technical consultant to the film).

With that, and some other melodramatic moments provided by Brolin's long-suffering wife played by Brenda Vacarro, the movie resembles more of a made-for-television movie than a feature film. But despite these minor flaws, the film does work as a sort of political thriller afterall.

The soundtrack, courtesy of Jerry Goldsmith, is probably one of the best ever written for a 1970's film and well-worth purchasing. Like Hyams' ""Outland"" starring Sean Connery and Peter Boyle, ""Capricorn One"" follows a similar theme: one man fighting insurmountable odds and the corrupt elements of the organization in which he belongs, at the risk of his own life in his search for the truth.",1153353600,,2299,5.0795755968169765

1192063,4,B0000066CQ,"The notion of conspiracy within the bowels of the U.S. government was very much on people's minds following the triple traumas of the JFK assassination, Vietnam, and Watergate.  Even as something noble as manned space flight couldn't escape the grasp of the conspiracy theorists out there, as many of them didn't believe that the Apollo 11 moon landing of July 20, 1969 ever took place, that it was done on a Hollywood soundstage.  In 1978, one film took this conspiracy all the way to Mars and back.  That film was CAPRICORN ONE, a fairly taut combination of science fiction and conspiracy thriller elements that, in some ways, presaged later TV shows like ""The X Files"", and, perhaps inadvertently, also accelerated the conspiracy theorists' attacks on America's manned space program.

James Brolin, Sam Waterston, and O.J. Simpson portray the three men who are about to embark on a ten-month space voyage whose ultimate goal is a manned walk on Mars.  But just minutes before their ship, Capricorn One, is to lift off from the Kennedy Space Center, they are immediately ordered off; and the spacecraft launches to Mars without them.  Bewildered and upset, they are then told by NASA's director (Hal Holbrook) that the life support system built into the spacecraft was faulty and that it is likely that it would have failed before the ship could ever get into Mars' orbit.  They are instead ordered to ""fake"" the landing and the Mars walk on a soundstage in a hangar somewhere in the Mojave Desert, much against their principles though under the threat of their families being killed.  Then the spacecraft they are supposedly coming home in loses its heat shield upon re-entry, meaning that both it and the three astronauts inside have supposedly been incinerated.  The trouble is, of course, that all three men are actually alive and well, and Holbrook knows that the space program's continued success, if not its very existence, is incumbent upon them never appearing anywhere in public again.

Into the breach steps in an enterprising news reporter (Elliot Gould) who, against all odds and some very sardonic colleagues, investigates the Capricorn One incident and uncovers the truth, only to be pursued by military personnel in Blackhawk choppers.  In the meantime, Brolin, Waterston, and Simpson break out of the hangar and escape into the Mojave Desert.  Only Brolin is able to evade capture or death, however; and it takes some quick thinking by Gould and an eccentric crop-dusting pilot (Telly Savalas) to straighten things out.

Peter Hyams, whose later sci-fi forays included the HIGH NOON-inspired 1981 opus OUTLAND, and the much-underrated 1984 film ""2010"" (the sequel to the 1968 Stanley Kubrick classic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) directs with a good flair for suspense sequences, especially Brolin's struggle for survival in the desert as he is chased by government agents--sequences that include loose homages to both Kubrick's DOCTOR STRANGELOVE and Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  He also gets good performances from his cast, however, not only from Brolin, Simpson, and Waterston as the beleaguered would-be heroes, but also from Holbrook, who does a typically solid turn as the NASA bureaucrat with a mess on his hands.  The Mars landing sequences, though done on a soundstage for obvious reasons, have a crazy kind of realism to them, thanks to the special effects work of Bruce Mattox, Henry Millar, and Robert Spurlock, and the solid cinematography of Bill Butler, who worked on Steven Spielberg's 1975 suspense masterpiece JAWS.  Jerry Goldsmith, who had won an Oscar for THE OMEN in 1976, and whose sci-fi credits include PLANET OF THE APES, also provides a tense and dramatic score, with almost Stravinsky-like menace.

In the end, while it may not be the most perfect sci-fi film ever made, CAPRICORN ONE was one of those films that was right for its time, insofar as it managed to attach something as honorable as manned space travel to a Watergate-type of cover-up scenario.  And while that kind of plot may not have been considered totally believable, either back in 1978 or even now in the 21st century, it still (rightly) made a big deal about how our government too often dissembles the truth in pursuit of its own self-aggrandizement.",1145145600,,4266,5.044096728307254

Coincidentally, it's also a film in which the third act fails, so those in charge decide to fake it to save face. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie and the acting is first rate (although take note that O.J. Simpson received very few lines), but the fact is that it ended at a very odd place. I'm not revealing where that was, but any of you familiar with screenwriting will know what I mean when I say it had no third act. Yes, it was a well done drama that gripped and intrigued you, but the big payoff that you expect isn't there. Instead you are left to assume that it happens off camera as the credits roll. It was like reading a really good book and then discovering the last chapter is missing. But, if you can stand to fill in the blanks yourself, this really is a pretty good flick. It's best feature is that it will get you thinking about a real life incident.

The movie was based loosely on the possibility that the 1969 moon landing was faked by NASA in order to beat the Russians. This may sound insane, but when one is presented with some of the evidence, one becomes at least intrigued by the possibility. (Check out the Fox special ""Conspiracy theory: Did We Land on the Moon?"" Yeah I know it's a Fox special, but it's good, trust me.) Questions such as ""Why can we see shadows on the moon pointing in conflicting directions when NASA claims the only light source was the sun?"" and ""How does the American flag flap in the supposedly airless atmosphere?"" have caused some to believe we never made it to the moon.

Regardless of this, Capricorn One is a C+ film with an A+ cast and a D- ending, but it still receives my endorsement and I encourage you to go pick it up and judge for yourself.",1118793600,,1824,4.253602305475504

I recently recorded it when AMC showed it in full screen. What a difference. The part that really showed full screen in all its horror was when Elliot Gould and Karen Black are riding in the 280Z and the camera shows a front view of them. In full screen you only see one of them at a time as the camera pans back and forth to whoever is talking. On my new DVD you get to see both actors at the same time. And of course thre are many, many other scenes that are like that also. Some reviewers said the transfer was not good but I disagree. This DVD looks great and what a story, even if far-fetched and a little slow in the middle. Telly Savales as a crusty old crop duster is a real hoot. Gould says, ""I'm Cauldfield"". Savales says , ""I can't help that"". Gould says, ""I thought you said $100 to rent your plane?"" Savales says , ""$125 because you said OK to $100 too quick, smart a#%"".

1192070,4,B0000066CQ,"""Capricorn One"" (1978) is quite simply one of my all-time favorite movies:  a fast-paced conspiracy thriller brimming with excellent performances and a script by writer/director Peter Hyams which is filled with witty dialog and believable situations.  And the cast is terrific:  Elliott Gould as an investigative reporter who has ""cried wolf"" one too many times, James Brolin, Sam Waterston and O.J. Simpson (Let's not go there.) as ill-fated astronauts, Hal Holbrook as a shady NASA chief, Brenda Vacarro as Brolin's dutiful wife, David (""Bosley"") Doyle as Gould's harried editor and David Huddleston as a congressman and NASA booster.  Add funny cameos by Karen Black as Gould's fellow reporter and Telly Savalas as a crop-duster pilot who comes in late and saves the day and you have a terrific cast that brings welcome professionalism to what could have been a silly affair.

The plot is typical '70's-era political paranoia in that it involves NASA faking a mission to Mars then having to terminate the ""astronauts"" when the plan goes awry and the public believes the astronauts have been lost.  Enter third-rate reporter Robert Caulfield (Gould), who is tipped-off that something is wrong by a NASA engineer (Robert Walden) who promptly disappears.  It's up to Caulfield to figure out what's going on (much to the chagrin of his skeptical editor Doyle) while the astronauts plot an escape into the West Texas desert.

Everything is preposterous, yes, but Hyams directs with such slam-bang pacing and such an obvious sense of humor it's hard not to get involved in the story.  And there are two excellent action set-pieces:  Gould piloting an out-of-control car through the streets of Houston and a thrilling last-minute cliffhanger involving two menacing helicopters and Savalas' crop duster.

Actually, I like everything about this film, from the performances, especially Doyle and Savalas, who are hysterical, to the fact that O.J. gets killed halfway through the film.(Okay, I couldn't resist.)  Hyams' script, his direction, the production values are all top-notch and the musical score is memorable, especially over the fast-paced opening credits, which set the mood for everything that follows.  And for once a film ends on just the right note.

In all, this one is a winner, and would rate ***** (out of *****) if it weren't for the disappointing DVD package, which contains production notes and a widescreen 2:35:1 print and nothing else.  Since Hyams is still working today, a commentary track doesn't seem too much to ask, does it?  Until then, even this treatment can't harm a terrific popcorn flick.",1093651200,,2617,5.180522565320665
1192071,3,B0000066CQ,"If this wasn't the original Black Helicopters movie, it sure went a long way toward immortalizing that aviatory image as a sure sign of evil government conspiracies. On a personal note, I remember it for two things -- seeing it on a Sunday afternoon with my Dad on the best weekend we spent together of my pre-teen years; and first hearing the ""black guy dies first"" movie custom from Dad.
The plot is simple and, at the time, rather chilling. Remember, it was only nine years after the 1969 moon landing, even less after Vietnam lies began coming to light and four years after Watergate climaxed with Nixon's resignation. Also, it's one year after the Viking unmanned craft landed on Mars.
The first manned mission to Mars has a wee bit of a problem -- a life support system that was too cheap and discovered too late. NASA needs this mission to be successful with no glitches to keep its considerable funding amidst dying interest in the space program. Solution? Fake the mission! Hal Holbrook explains all this to astronauts James Brolin, Sam Waterston and O.J. Simpson (there were athletic black actors who could ACT in the 1970s, but the trend was to use famous and semi-famous jocks. Probably has something to do with Q ratings and bankability). Holbrook persuades them to go along in a manner that makes you ask ""Are the government or major corporations such as the aerospace industry siblings, distant cousins, kissing cousins or incestuous siblings with the Mafia?""
All is well until technology and the astronauts begin little rebellions that hint this mission isn't exactly a space oddity. This puts Eliott Gould, a newspaper guy always foolishly swinging for the fence sexually and professionally, on the case. Unlike others, I think the part as written called for Gould, someone who could flow between drama and comedy seamlessly.
So you've got Gould doing his Scooby Gang thing and the whole months long fakery being pulled off when there's another wee problem on reentry. That sets up the last third to half of the movie when we get black helicopters, snake lunches and Telly Savalas.
Not a great flick for the quality cast involved (Gould, Waterston, Holbrook, Denise Nicholas, Robert Walden) but a good one. It does drag in some spots. The DVD doesn't have enough extras to be a great DVD or even a good one -- no commentaries, just some production notes. I bought it just because I wanted the movie. I'm not sorry I did, but the DVD package is still disappointing.",1089936000,,2481,4.799065420560748
1192072,3,B0000066CQ,"In many ways, Capricorn One is a quissential example of a '70s action film.  The film tells the story of the first manned spaceflight to Mars and the three dedicated pioneers (played by James Brolin, Sam Waterston, and O.J. Simpson -- and yes, it is impossible to watch the film without thinking about Simpson's most recent role) who bring hope to a cynical country by conquering the Red Planet.  The only problem, of course, is that the whole thing is a fake.  The three men are actually in a hastily constructed studio in the middle of a barren desert and their spacecraft is empty as it journeys through space and time.  As implausible as this plot may sound, the film actually goes to the trouble to make the reasoning behind this plot believable and it even goes to the trouble to provide some humanity to the plot's mastermind, a NASA official played by Hal Holbrook.  Because the film actually takes the time to set up the situation, it remains compelling even when that empty spacecraft happens to burn up on reentry, meaning that -- in order for the three spacemen to remain martyrs and for NASA to continue to get funding -- they have to die in reality as well.  As the three men try to escape across the barren desert (pursued by three very ominous helicopters -- never has a sinister government conspiracy ever looked so realistically sinister), a reporter played by Elliott Gould slowly starts to uncover the conspiracy and soon his life is in danger as well.
While the basic plot itself is similar to quite a few recent action films, what distinguished Capricorn One is that the film -- made while the nation, still feeling the pain of Watergate and Viet Nam, was still getting used to not being able to trust the government -- plays this story totally straight.  Neither of the film's leads (Brolin and Gould) manage to get off a single smirky one-liner in the style of our modern action heroes and the film makes it painstakingly clear that neither one of them is invulnerable.  Brolin's trek through the desert is almost painful to watch (at one point, nearly dead of dehydration, Brolin very graphically kills and eats a rattlesnake -- a scene that would verge on disgusting if it wasn't obvious that Brolin's life depends on his actions).  As for Gould, he has a wonderful scene in which he discovers that his car's breaks have been tamepered with and the entire sequence of his car racing out of control down the streets of Houston before eventually plunging off a bridge is almost totally shot from his point of view -- it's a scary sequence that is well-directed and if it's conclusion seems a little far fetched, the build-up is almost equal to the famous car chase in The French Connection.
That said, this is not a perfect film.  Director/Writer Peter Hyams allows quite a few scenes to go on a bit too long.  (The film is full of quirky characters but occasionally, the spend so long being quirky that it becomes obvious that they're there for no other purpose other than to show off that quirk.)  This is a two hour film that would have been better if it had been thirty minutes shorter.  The film has a clever script but far too many scenes (especially of Gould's character trying to figure out the conspiracy) seem to repeat each other for no basic reason other than the lack of a good editor.  The performances are a mixed bag.  Gould does a good job for the most part except for a few scenes when he was seems to be chanelling Dustin Hoffman from All The President's Men.  As for the three astronaughts, their characters aren't strong developed beyond a few identifying quirks -- Brolin is the heroic one, Waterston is the funny one, and Simpson -- well, he doesn't really get any identifying quirks beyond being O.J. Simpson.  Of the three, only Waterston gives a memorable performance and this is largely because he gets the funny lines.  Brolin is -- well, he's Brolin, vaguely likeable but mostly dull.  Simpson's performance is a typical O.J. Simpson performance -- he seems to be trying really hard to excel at something that he has no talent at.  You'd almost feel sorry for him if he wasn't O.J.
As far as the supporting roles are concerned, there's a lot of familiar faces and it's a mixed bag.  Both Karen Black and Telly Savalas put in what the credits assure us are ""special appearances.""  Black is occasionally amusing even if her character serves no real purpose while Savalas manages to bring the film to a dead stop by wildly overplaying a role that one hopes was meant to be comic relief but, which in the end, just serves as a very annoying distraction.  On the plus side, Brenda Vaccaro is sympathetic and compelling as Brolin's wife and the undderrated Denise Nichols has one good scene as Simpson's wife -- one almost regrets that the crew of Capricorn One had to be male as Vacarro and Nichols give the type of performances that should have come from Brolin and Simpson.  However, the film's greatest performance is given by the great Hal Holbrook who, instead of playing an outright, melodramatic villian, instead plays a human being who, for good reasons, does some truly evil things.  Indeed, the film's main strength is Holbrook's villian who serves as a great testament to what can happen when idealism gives way to self-righteousness.  By the film's end, you may hate Holbrook but you never cease to understand him and even mourn the person he used to be.
Capricorn One is a flawed film and it's a dated film but it is still a film that is worth seeing for both it's nostalgia value (Yes, Virginia, there actually was a time when journalists were considered heroes) and for an example of a believable and compelling action film.",1088035200,,5687,4.650698602794411
1192073,4,B0000066CQ,"Good entertainment.  It plays on the old ""the moon landing was all a giant hoax"" conspiracy theory.  There are people who still believe that, and this film is built on the same plot.  The trip to Mars was a failure, and so the ""power brokers"" stage it with real astronauts who have to be killed in the end, and movie and television tricks.

Hal Holbrook plays the heavy (bad government guy in charge of the hoax, including killing folks). Elliott Gould is the plucky young reporter (Caulfield) who is being set up by the government because he knows too much, and suspects more than he knows.  The three astronauts are played by James Brolin, O.J. Simpson and a young Sam Waterson.  They are supposed to be killed when their heat shield fails on re-entry (to avoid any embarrassing leaks later), but they escape from their southwest location.  Even Telly Savalas gets a part in the solution, as Elliott Gould closes in on the bad (read ""government"") guys who are caught red-handed in their hoax on the gullible American people (aren't they always?).

This film has the whole schmeer, including the black helicopters, bad politicians (probably Republicans, of course), car chases, gun battles from airplanes, and the bad guys getting their comeuppance in the end.

It's good entertainment.

Now for the bad part....this movie definitely deserves a better DVD than this. It is widescreen, but not enhanced as it should be.

The key plot device is, unfortunately, ludicrous (no, I won't give it away) because (1) NASA could not have possibly overlooked such an obvious giveaway and (2) every teenage geek and nerd in the country would have caught it way before the intrepid reporter finally puzzles it out.

1192077,5,B0000066CQ,"This flick is a lot of fun.  Considering they made the film on $5 million dollars, it's even more amazing.  And there's quite a few stars from 1970's television and movies, so it's an all-star cast.  The film has been preserved in excellent condition.  The cinematography is crystal clear throughout.  I own the film on DVD and I'll mention the additional features.
As you know, the guys were going to Mars when something funny happened.  Like their boss asking them to fake the mission.  But it's all to save the space agency.  Will our heroes cooperate and cover up the fake mission?  You gotta order the movie to find out!  But here's a few things for you to watch for.
I've never been a big Elliott Gould fan, but I like him here.  He's perfect as the conspiracy-nut reporter barely able to keep his job.  His boss, David Doyle (Charlie's Angels) is here as a skeptical assignment editor.  Karen Black (Airport 1975) loans Gould a beautiful red Datsun 280Z 2+2 after his blue 1965 Mustang goes for a swim.  Robert Walden (Lou Grant) is a NASA console operator who makes an issue about the unusual TV signals from the spacecraft.  Hal Holbrook is the brother-in-law for James Brolin but I'm not sure you'd invite him to the family reunion after this flick.  Sam Waterston (The Killing Fields) and O.J. Simpson (The Naked Gun) are the other two crewman in the spacecraft with Brolin (sure the spacecraft is a bit small to take to Mars, but hey, it's a MOVIE ... just enjoy it).
James Brolin's character (Brubaker) has a bit of a problem with a snake in the desert ... he had a similar problem with a snake in the desert in ""Westworld"" in 1973 (""Capricorn One"" is a 1978 film).  Sam Waterston's character likes to tell jokes, though his last joke is a bit ironic.  Brenda Vaccaro (Airport '77) is Mrs. Brubaker, James Brolin's movie wife.  James B. Sikking (""Hill Street Blues"") is here, as are Telly Savalas (""Kojak"") and David Huddleston (the mayor from ""Blazing Saddles"").
Telly Savalas is a crop-duster who helps Caulfield (Elliott Gould) search for the missing astronauts.  The chase sequences, especially between two Hughes 500 attack helicopters and a crop-duster plane are just great.  The chase sequence is several minutes long and includes some dramatic low-level and close-canyon-wall flying.  The camera work for the flying sequences is simply breath-taking.  Perfectly executed in my opinion.
Regarding the film, there is a bit of language and a small amount of innuendo, so a PG rating is about right.  On the DVD you get optional Spanish subtitles, a teaser and a theatrical trailer, production notes and a bit about the cast and crew.  Fortunately, the film is widescreen which is much appreciated during the flying sequences.
This is a great film...  Perfect for your collection.  Don't let them mislead you on the picture quality; it's very, very good on the DVD I can assure you.",1050796800,,2899,4.769076305220883
1192078,4,B0000066CQ,"The story of a faked mission to Mars, ""Capricorn One"" is the ultimate '70s conspiracy movie and, by a twist of fate or marketing genius, its release on DVD is perfectly timed to capitalize on a resurgent interest in claims that the moon landing was staged.  Very much a product of its day, Hyams' 1978 feature is crying out for a remake with a tighter, more sophisticated script, greater suspense, livelier characters, updated music (though Jerry Goldsmith's overblown score is a classic of '70s sci-fi) and a more satisfying ending - Hyams drops the curtain just when the drama is about to escalate to an entirely different level.  But for all its faults, the film's sheer strength of concept still carries it through.  The performances are strangely stilted, but even veterans like Elliot Gould are bad in this, so we can presumably blame the direction.  Only Hal Holbrook stands out with a wonderful soliloquy in the opening act: it's four-minutes long, but he has you hanging on every word - which nicely disproves the Hollywood theorem that big slabs of dialogue just don't play.",1038528000,,1084,4.875
1192079,4,B0000066CQ,"CAPRICORN ONE is a film that when I saw it in the theatre in its original release - I was impressed. I walked out thinking that - wow, can this really happen?
The film is written and directed Peter Hyams (2010: The Year We Make Contact, Stay Tuned) and has a realism about it that makes conspiracies seem real. The cast is quite good - with the exception of one person. Leading the pack is Elliot Gould as a reporter who stumbles on a story that involves astronauts James Brolin, Sam Waterson and O.J. Simpson (yuch!) in what ends up being a staged performance. There are some great performances by Brenda Vaccaro and Telly Sevalas (TV's Kojack). I don't want to give away the plot or story too much - but it has a great build up to a good strong ending.
One of the best aspects of the film I enjoy most is the score. Academy Award winning composer Jerry Goldsmith does some of his best work in this film. You know his musical schemes from films like Patton, Star Trek The Motion Picture, Legend (Original Version - see my review) and countless TV and Movie Productions.
Technically the film is an action and adventure. It has special effects and car chases and you must remember it is the product of the late 70's - so forgetting the period costumes of the time - the film is technically up to speed.

1192080,2,B0000066CQ,"Conspiracy theories abound over whether we really did land on the Moon.  The most commonly entertained of them is the one claiming that an empty rocket was sent into space while the actual Moon landing was conducted in a Hollywood sound stage.  ""Capricorn One"" puts that theory into film with a slight change in premise being that the mission is supposed to be to Mars instead.  The flight director (played by Hal Holbrook) removes the astronauts (played by James Brolin, O.J. Simpson, and Sam Waterston) from the space capsule just prior to launch and has them come with him to a sound stage in the desert somewhere.  It seems that the life support systems the astronauts were to use on Mars were extremely faulty, and rather than risk having the Mars program shut down or risking the lives of the astronauts, the flight director cajoles them into faking the landing, right down to the first steps upon Mars.  The plans go awry when the real capsule, containing no one, burns up on re-entry.  Since the astronauts are presumed dead as a result of that, the flight director has no choice but to order the deaths of the real astronauts, lest his dirty little secret get out.  Up to this point, ""Capricorn One"" is quite compelling, if not totally believable.  Unfortunately, after this point, the movie degenerates into nothing more than a series of formulaic chase scenes that plagues far too many movies in the 1970's.  It's another case of where the director only thought the story through halfway and resorted to stock scenarios fill the other half.  The astronauts manage to escape into the desert before being executed.  Since they don't know the correct direction to civilization, they decide to each go in separate directions to find help.  Of course, except for the astronaut played by James Brolin, they are hunted down and killed.  The movie ends simply with Brolin running to his wife at his funeral.  Had the director not chosen this cheesy, cop-out ending, I could have forgiven the movies formulaic aspects and still given it a positive review.  However, with any sort of denouement showing the consequences and fallout from this scandal, I was left flat and disappointed.

It's a shame really, because there was a lot of potential in it.  As it is, it's an entertaining and utterly unrealistic adventure movie about a bunch of astronauts who are blackmailed into faking a landing on Mars.
The movie started out well, but as it went along, more and more loose strings began to show up, until there were so many it almost became a joke.  What started out seeming to be a serious thriller, end up being an adventure movie, with bits of action so implausible that even NASA's phenomenal training program couldn't explain it's astronaut's amazing feat of hinging from a biplane's guidewires while it did loops.
The movie drags at points too, spending 5 minutes to follow one of the astronauts on the run in the desert, telling a really lame joke to himself, then being caught.  There was no point to it. At all.
Ok, so now that I've trashed the movie, I'll admit that I really did enjoy it.  I have it on tape and I pull it out a couple times a year for a bit of fun.  It's implausible, silly, but it's fun, both for the actors and for the action antics and cracked plot.

If you liked ""JFK,"" ""The X-Files,"" ""The Philadelphia Experiment,"" or the Showtime movie ""Roswell,"" you'll enjoy ""Capricorn One."" Even if you don't like conspiracy movies, you can enjoy ""Capricorn One"" for being a suspenseful thriller. The ending is amazing and it is reminiscent of a great scene from ""You Only Live Twice."" Telly Savalas has a memorable role as a foul-mouthed cropduster pilot.
Space buffs will either be drawn to this movie or disgusted by the film's blatant use of Apollo hardware for the Mars ship and lander. But this movie is just a fantasy and isn't meant to be realistic. It strives to create a paranoid fantasy where an oppressive and corrupt government tries to kill its honest citizens just to save face.
Give this forgotten flick a try. You won't be disappointed.",1000944000,,1411,4.806584362139918

Good acting by familiar faces and the only movie in which both of Barbra Streisand's husbands (the first, Elliot Gould and the current, James Brolin) appear together in leading roles.

1192101,4,B0000066CQ,"The first men on mars meet no little green men, see no alien cities or other wonders when they step out of their tin-foil covered landing module and fall on the porous rock of the martian surface.  Nobody comes out to greet them as they stick their flags into the soil and make their speeches.  Skeptics know this because there is no life on Mars.  But the paranoid skeptics know the same for a different reason - the mission is a sham.
With interest flagging in spaceflight, NASA knows that any mistake will doom the entire manned space program.  However, knowing how many corners were cut, the chiefs are assured only of failure.  So they cut the biggest corner of all and relocate the landing module, the command module - essentially everything but the Saturn V booster (a real Mars-ship would need a considerably larger booster ofcourse...) - into the hangars of a deserted air force base (Roswell, probably), and work video magic.  The crew, completely innocent but convinced to exit their ship at the last minute, is horrified to learn the sham they are perpetrating.  ""You'd be dead in 6 weeks"" the grim NASA chief assures them.  Reluctant at first, the crew agrees to carry on the charade, mostly because the country needs them, but also because NASA needs them (when you invite the President to your launching, and the Veep shows up instead, you know you've got problems).  And if they're still not convinced, a shadowy cabal of bureaucratic and corporate types (the guys responsible for the screwed up equipment in the first place) will kill them and their families.
Accidents do happen, slowly but surely cluing in an investigative reporter (Elliot Gould).  People dissappear, falling into mysterious holes that also suck in their entire identities.  The first victim, a NASA engineer who can't understand why the signals from Capricorn One aren't taking long to reach Earth given its purported distance.  Gould is great - tenacious, but never so big a charachter that he wouldn't slip through the cabal's rapacious grip.
Capricorn One is fun because it runs two plots well - besides Gould, we have the pilots growing uneasy and fearful of their safety - eageraly leaving clues of the sham to their families through frequent communiques.  When an escape doesn;t completely succeed, the astronauts find themselves on truly alien ground - and have to pull every trick they know to survive.
Capricorn One is also fun because of the TV stars who pop up - making the movie look less like a movie and more like TV, like David Doyle as Gould's boss, and future Hill Street Blues alums Barbara Bosson and James Sikking.  Even Telly Savalas shows up as a cropduster who teaches us all a lesson in baragining - (""you said $200 too fast, you can afford $300!"")
But most of all, this movie preserves that special paranoia, kept on ice until he X-files, created in the 1970's by movies like ""All The President's Men"" and ""Parralax View"".  With Jerry Goldsmith's creepy score, ""Capricorn One"" is probably what ""Apollo 13"" would have looked like if shot by Oliver Stone.",980899200,,3066,4.8133333333333335
1192102,3,B0000066CQ,"What a great flick.  Elliot Gould looking his 70's best.  Pre-trial OJ being a hero.  Amazing!  The premise of the movie is a little off, though.  I mean, if the astronauts who never went to the moon kept quiet, certainly these guys who never went to Mars would too, right?
If you're into 70's cheesey Sci-Fi, this is the movie for you! Get Hangar 18 and make it a double feature!",978566400,,380,4.295774647887324

It boasts a cast of actors that never quite made it big, all turning in excellent performances: Elliott Gould, James Brolin, Brenda Vaccaro, Sam Waterston, Hal Holbrook, Karen Black, Telly Savalas, you even get O.J. Simpson in one of his finest minutes.
I get a big kick out of films made in the '70's. The mens fashions were priceless. Those wonderful suits, ties, and haircuts ! What a hoot it all was.
A favorite scene is the one with Sam Waterston on the cliff, and the crop-dusting plane chase is fabulous. The Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack is terrific, as is Bill Butler's cinematography.

1192116,5,B0000066CQ,"I'll say this much, when ITC Entertainment Group focused more on motion pictures than television series(The classic Space:1999 series for example),  they definately cranked out some winners. Films like The Eagle Has Landed,  Satrun 3, Green Ice, and The Legend Of The Lone Ranger for example.  However, the British Television and Motion Picture really brought out a  winner in 1977 with the release of the classic science fiction/action  adventure/political and conspiracy thriller, Capricorn One. Written and  Directed by the great Peter Hyams, and starring an astounding cast of  actors that consisted of James Brolin, Elloit Gould, Sam Waterston, Hal  Holbrook, Brenda Vaccaro, Telly Savalas, David Doyle, Karen Black, and  countless others. Nt to mention having an explosive soundtrack by  Academy-Award winning composer Jerry Goldsmith.
I first saw the movie on  NBC's Sunday Night at the movies, and it made me a fan of James Brolin for  life. The movie tells the story of NASA's first mission to Mars, and how  much NASA's future is riding on this major project. If the mission is a  failure, then Congress will cut back funding on the manned space program.  When the three astronauts are about ready to launch, they are immediately  pulled out from the Apollo space capsule and are flown to an abandoned Air  Force base in Texas. There, they are told by the cheif flight director of  the project, that due to a faulty life support system, the mission would  put the astronauts in peril. In order to assure the future of NASA and  future space flights, they are told to fake the Mars landing on a very  convincing soundstage. If they do not cooperate, their families will be  killed. The astronauts have no choice nut to participate in the elaborate  hoax. At the same time, one of the NASA technicians discovers that the  transmissions from the space craft are not coming from the spacecraft. The  technician tells a reporter friend of his, and the reporter begins to  investigate. When the mission comes to n end, the capsule suddenly burns up  in the Earth's atmosphere, due to a faulty heatshield, the three  astronauts, knowing their lives are in jeopardy, escape from their captors  into the Texas desert, hoping to expose the sensational fraud. From that  point on, it becomes a game of cat and mouse for the astronauts and the NBC  news reporter trying to solve the mystery and blow the whistle on the  governmental conspirators involved.
Definately one of the best thrillers  of the post Watergate '70's, and in some ways, much like the film Hanger 18  and The X-Files television series and movies. Not only is it entertaining,  and has a very solid plot, it is also a movie that referes heavily back to  the old conspiracy theory of a faked Moon landing. James Brolin, as always,  shines as the lead astronaut who desperately tries to reach civilization  and expose the conspiracy for what it is. Elloit Gould did a good job as  the reporter, yet I think either Harrison Ford or Roy Thinnes could have  done a better job. Karen Black was good as the other television news  reporter, yet, I also think that former James Bond girl Lois Chilles would  have been a better choice.
The action was really good, especially the  helicopter chase sequence in the end. Definately some very good stunt work  in that scene. Especially the astronauts escape from the abaondoned hanger.  Sam Waterston was very humourous in his role. And as always, Hal Holbrook  was good as the man caught in the middle of
the hoax. His character was  not a villain, his character was someone who did not realize how serious  the government agaents were in pulling the conspiracy off. Telly Savalas  was really a hoot as the curmudgeony crop duster who helps Gould rescue  Brolin in the desert from government asassins.
Definately one of my  favorite movies. It may be controversial, but it still packs a whallop and  delivers the goods. It would have been great if James Brolin had done more  movies instead of television. He truly showed the audience that he could do  movies.
Interesting side note, watch the ending of the film, and you'll  suddenly realize that both Brolin and Gould have something in common. Gould  is Barbara Streisand's ex-husband. And Brolin is currently Barbara's new  husband. Coincidence? I'll let you decide.",969235200,,4323,4.893646408839779
1192117,4,B0000066CQ,"Suprisingly, I saw this movie for the first time just a few short days ago, even though I was old enough to have seen it when it hit the theaters.  A shame I let it go so long.
  At the beginning of this movie, three  astronauts (played by James Brolin, Sam Waterston, and O.J. Simpson) are  pulled from a space flight destined for Mars.  There was something wrong  with the life-support system.  The director of the space program (Hal  Holbrook) says that they can't afford for the flight to be cancelled, so  the three astronauts are coerced through threats to go through with a fake  landing filmed on a closed base.
  A reporter (Elliot Gould) talks with  a friend (Robert Walden) who claims there is something mysterious going on  with the flight.  Immediately after this revelation, the friend disappears  with no trace of him having ever existed.  The reorter begins a quest to  find out what is going on.
  Meanwhile, the now unmanned spaceship  burns up on re-entry.  This means that except for the three astronauts and  few head people in the space program, everyone else thinks they're all  dead.  This leads to the exciting last half of the movie.
  A similar  conspiracy theory (held mostly by extreme nutcases) revolves around our own  moon shots, but this movie makes the plot an extremely good way to pass a  couple of hours.",963014400,,1341,4.675324675324675
1192118,1,B0000066CQ,"it offers a chance for those crackpot conspiracy theorists to say,"" Hey, what did I tell you?  We never landed on the moon during the Apollo Program!""  It's obvious that their so-called ""evidence"" is  baloney, and this movie unneccessarily gives them credibility.  In fact,  Bill Kaysing, author of the book We Never Went to the Moon in 1974, claims  that Hyams based this movie on his book.  Hyams publicly denied that  allegation, claiming that the movie was ""for entertainment and for  fun, and frankly, I think those people are being totally ludicrous.""  Astronaut Jim Lovell had this to say about Kaysing: ""the guy is wacky.  His problem is, he saw that movie Capricorn One, and now he thinks that's  really the way it goes.""  I agree with him 100%, and so would any  slightly educated person who is not as thick as a whale omlette.  They  might as well face up to the fact that we went to the moon, and quit making  a fool of themselves with their laughable theories.  Anyway, I think this  movie was, as Hyams said, ""entertaining and fun.""  There is a lot  of action when the capsule supposedly burns up on reentry and the three  astronauts realize they're expendable.  Still, I couldn't help but give  this movie one star because it gives those Grade-A fools a little  credibility.  Those people who feel so tragically isolate from others that  they feel the need to construct ridiculous ""hidden truths""  instead of growing up, getting educated, and learning real facts.

1192119,5,B0000066CQ,"Written and directed by Peter Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE was released in the theaters in 1978, one year after STAR WARS' twister. While George Lucas, with his revolutionary movie, had no other purpose than sheer  entertainment, Peter Hyams brought to the audience an adult sci-fi  movie.
I believe that CAPRICORN ONE is a masterpiece showing that Peter  Hyams was, a long time ago, a director with an enormous potential.  Unfortunately, this talent has been wasted since then.
The desert scenes  are frightening because it seems that these astronauts fighting for their  lives have to defend themselves against martians. Even the Arizona  scorpions or rattlesnakes appear rather as extraterrestrial enemies rather  than earthly animals.
CAPRICORN ONE is also a movie about mass  manipulation and develops a theme which Hyams will treat again with OUTLAND  : the fight of a man against a secret conspiracy.
If, like me, you hadn't  had the time to see this movie until now, buy it. It's worth the  discovery.

I love the  conspiracy theory films of the seventies, like , The Parralax View, The  Conversation etc, and this is a more crowdpleasing version of those great  films. I also am a big fan of Elliot Gould, who I love in this. He usaully  makes such bad films that this is a treat. He really needs a better agent.  In short, NASA fakes a manned mission to Mars.

Plus, the film makes an interesting comment on science-fiction:  the astronauts of Capricorn One are to become the heroes of science fact,  but find themselves acting out a fiction -- a very deadly one.
