8678836,3,B00NLEWNCU,"Key Largo, 1948 film

The southernmost part of Florida has a string of islands connected by a causeway. The film begins when a bus is stopped by the police who are searching for two men who escaped from jail. ""They always head for home."" A man arrives at the Largo Hotel; it is closed they say. It is hot and humid. Frank McCloud wants to see Mr. Temple and Nora, George's wife. The strangers arrived and offered a lot of money to rent the hotel for a week. They are told a hurricane will arrive. The shutters must be bolted shut, boats must be tied down. The wind and rain announce the hurricane. There is conflict among the guests. Then the surprise guest shows up. McCloud recognizes Johnny Rocco, the deported gangster.

There are some philosophical discussions about society that betray the origins of this story as a stage play, as well as its static action. Rocco displays his authoritarianism. He awaits a visitor from Miami, the local mob-ruled city. Rocco brags about fixing elections in cities and states (as if he was of the ruling class). Rocco whispers to Nora, she spits an answer. Why did Johnny Rocco succeed? Rocco demonstrates his knowledge of psychology (and a trick test). There is talk about cowardice and the sacrifice of a life for political ends. The storm worsens. In 1935 a high wind and tidal wave killed 800 people. Forces beyond human control. The storm ends, Rocco's boat has sailed away. The Sheriff shoots the fleeing Osceola brothers, he blamed them for the death of deputy sheriff Sawyer!

Ziggy arrives with his boys to inspect the merchandise. Was there counterfeiting in Cuba then? [The real contraband smuggled into this country was narcotics, but that was censored by the Production Code.] Johnny Rocco and his boys will return to Cuba. Frank will pilot the boat for them. Did Rocco leave Gay Dawn behind for a reason? Does Frank have a plan to conquer the enemy against the odds? Will the good guys win for a happy ending? ""Nobody in the world is safe when Johnny Rocco is alive."" Isn't this story similar to ""Petrified Forest"" with accents from ""Casablanca""? Will the Johnny Roccos continue to threaten America? Will any film explain how organized crime benefits the ruling class (else they would be persecuted).

Humphrey Bogart joined the Navy in WW I. He owned a sailboat and served as a Coast Guard Volunteer who watched for enemy submarines off the California coast during WW II. Note his many movies which involved the sea. Afterwards Bogart with others protested the HUAC investigation of Hollywood. He later said this was ""ill-advised"". Wall Street investors back the production of movies whose success repays the investors. Its not ""art"" but a business proposition that entertains and distracts people with fantasies to escape from their everyday life.",1475193600,,2803,4.845511482254698
