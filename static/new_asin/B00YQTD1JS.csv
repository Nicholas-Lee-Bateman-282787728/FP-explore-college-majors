7230022,5,B00YQTD1JS,Love James Mason. All his filmography needs to be made available.,1471132800,,65,5.0
7230023,5,B00YQTD1JS,"Five great noir flicks. These are such a cut above American noir produced at that time: better acted, certainly better directed. Herbert Lom, famous for comedy later in his career, appears in two of these as a very convincing bad guy. James Mason, Richard Todd, Trevor Howard are great in their roles. Overall, a great collection.

I wish they would have added, Never Let Go, produced around that time, starring Richard Todd and Peter Sellers.  If you've never seen Peter Sellers as a villain---a fire breathing villain--Never Let Go is a real treat.",1468022400,17,550,4.903225806451613
7230024,5,B00YQTD1JS,"As a movie collector with over 3000 Blu-rays and DVDs it's a pleasure, and a treat, to find something new that is so good.

(By the way, true movie collectors do not stream movies, they BUY them.)

Bear in mind, all of these movies were made before the British subjects were disarmed by their government.  So don't be surprised when you see the common man carrying a firearm in these movies. It was quite common at the time these movies were made.

These are good, really good.  I'm not going to try to write reviews for the 5 movies contained in this collection. But in some ways they remind me of some of the Humphrey Bogart movies where he played Sam Spade. Different plots, and story-lines but same type of, ""dark feel"".

I recommend that you watch the movies in the order that they are presented. However, I will give away a little bit by saying that my favorite in the set is ""Snowbound"".  Don't get me wrong, these are not on the level of Casablanca, Into Darkness, Sky Captain, or the Maltese Falcon.  But these movies are good 3.5 - 3.8 star movies.

I am kind of a night owl, but for maximum effect, I recommend watching these movies at night.",1452556800,51,1153,4.400943396226415
7230025,5,B00YQTD1JS,"Excellent collection of British noir, that reveals a surprisingly agile and - not surprisingly - extremely well-acted and directed sampling of the genre thru British lenses.  Print quality is good, could be better, but not to quibble; same for sound.  Each film is very entertaining in its own way, and history buffs will appreciate the use of then-current events as backdrops for the tales.  Nice to see the five male leads in their younger days, and to see them so well handled by the directors and cameramen.  Highly recommended - and look to releasing Volume II!",1452038400,24,566,4.864583333333333

7230027,5,B00YQTD1JS,"I haven't made my way through all of this 5-disc set yet -- only THE OCTOBER MAN, SNOWBOUND and THEY MET IN THE DARK. The latter, made during World War II on a budget far too low for its 90-minute-plus running time, is hardly a ""noir"" by anyone's description, unless you want to count the number of night shots in the first half as a basis for using the term. Rather, THEY MET IN THE DARK is a threadbare spy story that would bring discredit to the entire collection if most of what followed wasn't as good as it is. As it is, you can ignore it -- despite being one of the more accessible films of Czech-born director Karel Lamac, and move on to the rest of the set. (For the record, THEY MET IN THE DARK stars James Mason and Joyce Howard [a distinctly unattractive lead in this story] in a yarn about a dismissed Royal Navy commander who seeks to discover the people who tampered with his last issued orders, and finds more than he bargained for in the way of spies, saboteurs, and murderers. It has a huge cast [check out those opening credits], with a lot of recognizable names in relatively small parts [and a good performance by Brefni O'Rorke as a police inspector], a script co-authored by Miles Malleson [an actor/writer of considerable merit in both fields], and music by Benjamin Frankel [who became much better known in the 1950s and 1960s], but it's still not a terribly good movie -- oddly enough, Mason and Howard did a B-picture a bit earlier than this called THE NIGHT HAS EYES, which is much more easily classed as a ""noir,"" that would have fit much better here.)

But forget about THEY MET IN THE DARK, and concentrate on SNOWBOUND. I last saw that picture on television about 35 years ago, and it gets all kinds of apologies here in the packaging for its appearance (it's technically included as a ""bonus""). But it's a neat and very dark thriller about ex-British, German, Italian, and Lord-knows-what agents converging on a rundown ski lodge in the Italian Alps, all in search of something worth far more than the property [and also well worth killing for]). Director David MacDonald (THE BROTHERS) misses an opportunity to make a mid-picture auction sequence more suspenseful than it is, but makes up for this oversight almost everywhere else in the picture. Robert Newton, Dennis Price, Herbert Lom, and Marcel Dalio are just four of the players in this deadly game of chess, and Price is especially effective as a relatively innocent interloper, roped into a job the risks of which only gradually become apparent, only to catch up with the real danger around him just as it may be too late. It's all based on a Hammond Innes story but worthy of Ian Fleming's early work -- and see if you can spot the James Bond screen connection in the guise of one of the minor cast members. As to the apologies for the film's appearance, I don't know why this is, as it looks and sounds better than okay -- a match for any TV print of the 1970s, and good enough to show off some fine outdoor cinematography and an excellent score by Cedric Thorpe Davie. And it's a good enough movie to overcome the age of the materials (and let's face it -- there's not going to be an expensive digital restoration of this movie, good as it is). The opening menu pops up simply enough, with the ""play"" option in the default position. And if this is the weakest of the bunch in terms of preservation, I'm sure the rest look just fine. Of the other viewed so far,

Roy Ward Baker's THE OCTOBER MAN (which could be one of the two or three finest acting jobs ever done by John Mills) seemed like it might have some audio issues during the opening credits, but these were not in evidence during the movie itself, which is transferred from a high quality source, so that even the night scenes have the proper details. I won't give any details away about the specifics of the movie -- it would spoil too much -- but it is an absolutely first-rate story, script, and picture, and the kind of movie that Hollywood filmmakers of the era, while working their bigger, glossier productions, could have (and probably did) look on with envy, in terms of its cool, low-keyed subtleties in execution.",1440633600,59,4177,4.523809523809524

8718824,1,B00YQTD1JS,"There is only one okay film in this set of five: ""The Assassin"". The ""Assassin"" is filmed on location throughout Venice Italy. The ""Assassin"" keeps your attention, but is only okay; nothing special; nothing you haven't seen before, and not worth the cost. ""The Golden Salamander"" holds your attention for being filmed in Tunisia, but there is no cleverness in the script, and the good guy just gets lucky. ""The October Man"" is very boring. ""Snowbound"" is boring with characters that are not likeable or interesting, and the story has an incomplete, unlikely, and badly written ending.
""They Met in the Dark"" strings you along; you think it is going to get good, but it never does, and you soon become weary with a mundane script. I rate ""The Assassin"" at 4-stars. ""The Golden Salamander"" at 2-stars, and the other three films 1-star with terrible script-writing.",1497312000,2,862,4.910958904109589
