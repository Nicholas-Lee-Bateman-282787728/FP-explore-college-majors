7914821,5,B00001U0JB,"I read the other reviews and have to consistently agree with everyone else.  This video is excellent.  Paul, besides being a phenomonal guitar player, is a super teacher.  He explains everything very well, and not too quickly.  He plays everything super slow so you can get it, and then fast to show you what it could sound like once you get it.  I have been playing guitar for 23 years, can play a lot of tough stuff, but boy, my playing has improved even more than I have imagned in the last year by watching this video.  Paul gives you about 20 things in this video, and each and every thing is great, whether it be alternate picking (this is great! What a help), string skipping, patterns, arpeggios, etc.  If you can master the 20 or so things he gives you on this, you will become such a better guitar player - guranteed.  This video is worth every penny.  As a matter of fact, I'm buying his other one (Terrifying Guitar trip).  If you're a real, serious guitar player, this video will change your life.  One thing I would say is it's not for beginners, because there are some pretty complicated things he teaches that are advanced, so fyi.  It's also great to see him wail up close, which is what he does in the beginning.  And last but not least, check out the cool Bach-type thing he plays at the end - what a great ending.  Paul Gilbert rocks!",1112313600,4,1354,4.364
7914822,5,B00001U0JB,This is the best purchase anyone can make if you want to shred being that finding a good teacher that can teach this skill is not easy. Paul besides being an incredible player covers all bases of Alternate Picking and String Skipping like he was in front of you. This is worth every singe penny.,1107043200,,295,4.381818181818182
