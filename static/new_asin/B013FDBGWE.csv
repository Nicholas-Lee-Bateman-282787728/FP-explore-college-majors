7364060,3,B013FDBGWE,"Its a great series. Lots of historical accounts and information is presented and everything you want to know is here. The only problem I had with this was the small number of interviews with actual people and the absurd amount of pop culture references. This is supposed to be about the history and legends of monsters, not movies or TV shows that feature them.",1488412800,7,361,4.65625
7364061,5,B013FDBGWE,"I knew I wanted this set when I saw it  in a review in my facebook group, Haunters Hangout, I ordered this and got it Monday, I just finished watching it and was not disappointed. All 7 ""chapters"" In this 2 disc set is very informative and easy to watch. I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of horror of days gone by.",1452211200,5,328,3.9696969696969697
7364062,5,B013FDBGWE,"I have been a Mill Creek Entertainment fan for many years now.  I have several of their Movie Multipacks & Documentary Sets.  When I saw this was comming out, I said I HAD to buy this!  I was again pleased by my purchase of this documentary set by them.
  This is well worth your money to have this set",1444262400,3,302,4.0508474576271185
7364063,5,B013FDBGWE,The historical recreations are very well done.  And the content reaches into new depths of understanding for these many legends.  Recommended.,1444176000,3,142,5.714285714285714

8727482,3,B013FDBGWE,"This series has some decent referential historical significance but it is sometimes overshadowed by the sociological and political commentaries of some interviewees (ESPECIALLY EPISODE 3, The Undead)....

Listen, I am a deep thinker, I philosophy on society and psychology, cause and effect, etc, etc. but SOMETIMES A MOVIE IS JUST A MOVIE. I really think the commentary on zombies and/or the undead being some form or fashion a symbol or some archetype for our innate fear of difference of ""race"" or system of government, ETC.  is absolute ex-post-fact-o BABBLE!

Let me spell it out for you in basics: I am reasonably certain ANY unrelenting group or band of creatures, human or not, dead or not, who are not easily reasoned with or capable of conscious thought AND whom desire to eat you alive IS A PRETTY FRIGHTENING THOUGHT WITHOUT HAVING TO CORRELATE ONE IOTA OF MY OR THE WORLD'S SOCIOLOGICAL OR POLITICAL STANDINGS OR UNDERSTANDINGS...

Something does not have to be interpreted as profound in order to have value or even deep value. Don't overthink it or over talk it, you ruin things that way and sound stupidly pretentious.",1534809600,,1134,4.984126984126984
8727483,1,B013FDBGWE,"I kept watching, hoping that it would get better. I watched six episodes and then deleted the series. It's all about movies and that's about it. I was hoping for some facts or even fiction.. Nope. Actors and movies. Who cares.",1533686400,,226,4.536585365853658

8727485,3,B013FDBGWE,Way way to much about movies and fiction and not enough about the actual subject...and some of the interviews on the pop culture aspects are painful to listen to and go on and on and on and on,1529280000,,192,4.078947368421052
8727486,5,B013FDBGWE,I thought this was a great little series! The production values were pretty low but I didn't care. The information was so intriguing I binged the whole thing; The narrator was awesome too. I hope they add season 2!!,1525478400,,215,4.538461538461538

8727488,4,B013FDBGWE,"As a fan of horror movies, I enjoyed this series. It discusses the origins of many of the monsters portrayed in the movies and how many of these monsters have evolved over time with characteristics assigned to them in various books and/or movies becoming part of the lore.",1524182400,,272,4.6875
