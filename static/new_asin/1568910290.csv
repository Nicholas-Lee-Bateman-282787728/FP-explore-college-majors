7796974,5,1568910290,We love this series and have literally worn the DVDs out watching them over and over again.  Both the Solows obviously love teaching sign language and are very good at it.  These were made many years ago but are still very entertaining and informative.,1434153600,,252,4.704545454545454
7796975,5,1568910290,"This program is designed for hearing people. It is by far the best resource i have found. They are very clear in their demonstrations, and explanations. Amazing couple. Great because you can see it from two different people. They also give you ways to remember the signs. Great teachers. Thank you for making this!",1355011200,3,314,4.833333333333333
7796976,5,1568910290,"I remember this show on TV when it first came out. I already knew sign back then so I understood what they were saying since I have a severe to profound loss for 40 years. I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn the basics of ASL or to refresh their ASL skills. I also enjoyed this couple's tales about their family, and on deaf culture.",1348185600,2,344,4.149253731343284
7796977,5,1568910290,"I needed to learn American Sign Language (ASL) because someone very close to me cannot speak...she can only sign, despite the fact she can hear.  I had to self-learn ASL rapidly and turned to this DVD series.  Larry and Sharon made it VERY easy to learn ASL, and made it an enjoyable (and sometimes funny) process.  This is a very comprehensive series for someone who wants to lay down a foundation in sign language.  At times it seems difficult, as they sometimes tend to sign quickly, but I cannot emphasize enough how valuable and enjoyable this series is!!!  I have used many different ASL DVD series, but this is the only one that actually allowed me to learn easily and have fun doing it at the same time.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!",1330387200,2,738,4.553030303030303
7796978,5,1568910290,"I am taking an Asl class and wanted to supplement my text book. My partner and I love watching these videos. Larry and Sharon are so happily in love and so classic early 80's. It is fabulous. They are very thorough and give you tricks to remember the signs. They also give you personal anecdotes about deaf culture. At times it feels like you are watching a SNL skit, which I feel is another bonus:) It is also clear that they are very knowledgeable and professionals in the field. They are also clearly immersed in deaf culture. I paid 175 dollars for my introductory ASL course and text at TSD. I learned a lot from that class but having access to this entire library of videos that you can watch over and over, is going to pay for itself very quickly. Plus they also wear matching sweaters and you really can't beat that.",1312588800,5,824,4.392156862745098
7796979,1,1568910290,"I am 51 and hearing impaired. I cannot adequately hear a television and have tried hearing aids, but to no avail. I purchased this course in an attempt to learn sign language. The course would be fine if you have good hearing and can hear your T.V. If you are hearing impaired don't waste your money. Where are the subtitles when they are talking and explaining? They don't exist. This course is just made for people who have an interest in sign language, not for someone who actually needs it. If you are hearing impaired, you will get more out of a twenty dollar book.",1309046400,4,570,4.438095238095238
7796980,5,1568910290,we used these during our homeschooling years. I can't begin to tell you how wonderful they are. Sharon Solow comes from a family of deaf parents and it shows how dedicated and loving she is towards sign language. I entered asl classes and really had a handle on it! I got the privlege to meet Sharon at a workshop and she is so sweet just like on the video!,1252886400,6,357,4.188405797101449
7796981,5,1568910290,I really enjoyed these shows years ago-- now i work with a deaf person and enjoy being able to communicate rudimentarily with him without an interpreter. I would love to have this series on DVD!,1250726400,,194,4.571428571428571
7796982,5,1568910290,"I found one of these dvds at the public library during a rather dreadful experience taking an asl class (failed the final by one point). It was SO much better than the class; they explained stuff really well, and they were so cute and '80's! I hoped I would get to see their baby on the show, but no. Because unfortunately it is hard to find--the producers don't have it, nor Amazon. I'm going to look on e-bay.",1211673600,4,411,4.282051282051282
7796983,5,1568910290,"I use to watch this series as a kid on PBS regularly. I learned a lot of sign language from watching the shows. I still remember some to this day and it's been about 16 years. I have a friend with a deaf child and have referred her to these videos and plan to purchase them for myself so I can relearn the language.
The videos can be a little corny with the say it with sign theme song and all and you may feel like they are talking to you as children but if you can get past that you really can learn so much and easily. They are very thorough!",1056326400,6,545,3.875
