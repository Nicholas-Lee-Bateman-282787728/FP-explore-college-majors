232089,5,6300213137,"There is not much to add to the glowing recommendations of other reviewers.
This is a very tense, skillfully crafted episode that plays like a destroyer vs. submarine story. Both Kirk and the Romulan commander must out-think their own crews as well as one another. The issues of bigotry and war are explored without being overly preachy.
Mark Lenard does a superb job as the Romulan commander. The audience can sympathize with him while simultaneously rooting against him.
This is a brilliant episode that features the best, most exciting space battle of the series.",988243200,6,566,5.031914893617022
232090,5,6300213137,"Certain STAR TREK episodes resonate in the memory.  Even over 30 years after I first watched this, I can remember being 16, sitting with my father, telling him my ""discoveries"" about Romulans and Romans (I  was taking second-year Latin at the time), and listening to him tell me  about submarine warfare.
And I cannot forget Mark Lenard's face:  his  courage in the face of disillusionment with his government and in the face  of defeat.  ""I might have called you friend,"" he tells James Kirk  before he performs the ""one more duty"" that -- regrettably -- is  his to perform.
You know Kirk will never forget -- and that Spock's  desire, over a century later, to reunite the Vulcans with the Romulans is  born in that instant.
This is a tense and skillfully written and acted  story, set against the human struggles of Martine and Tomlinson, whose  marriage was interrupted by a Red Alert, and Stiles, whose bigotry creates  a tiny internal war on the ENTERPRISE's bridge.
One of the great episodes  of TOS, and a personal favorite.  All honor to Mark Lenard's memory.",959126400,2,1067,4.748633879781421
232091,5,6300213137,"This episode is one of my favorites.  I'm a fan of war history and military tactics and this episode is right up my alley.  Kirk and the Romulan Commander (Mark Lenard) are battling it out.  Their command skills  and experiences are just about equal, but Mark Lenard has the upper hand,  his ship can cloak, Kirk's can't.  Even with that advantage, Kirk out wits  him.  This episode is great.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I  highly recommend seeing it.",943660800,3,468,4.4523809523809526

7805461,5,6300213137,"Outstanding episode. One of the Original Series best.  The first introduction to the Romulans  and their link to the Vulcans.  The episode also included background science fiction history to the Star Trek Universe in regards to the Earth - Romulan War. Well plotted, well acted and tense. It also showed the burden of command on both  Kirk and the Romulan Commander and how much alike they both were.",1469232000,,400,4.838235294117647
7805462,4,6300213137,"Just my opinion, but this is one of the best episodes of Star Trek TOS. Got it for a good price here on Amazon. Also, I must admit I've always had a thing for Barbara Baldavin.",1397952000,,176,3.9166666666666665
7805463,5,6300213137,"of the entire Star Trek franchise. I know of no other single episode which captured so much tension and intensity in the face of battle (save perhaps ""Doomsday Machine""). the performances are flawless, the drama is top-notch. More is packed into these 51 minutes than in most Hollywood blockbusters. The drama is real, the intensity, everything. Not only is everyone aboard the Enterprise a living, breathing character, but so too is everyone aboard the Romulan vessel, and their own unique amibitions are show-cased just as finely as on the Enterprise.

For me, the single greatest moment in the episode occurs during the tactical briefing, and Stiles and Sulu begin sparring in a battle of wits over which is the correct choice of action. Later, the thoughts of Kirk, McCoy, Spock, and Scott all come in to play, and Kirk finally reaches a decision. The decision is most difficult, because even though there are two very different opinions, neither is right or wrong.

This is among the greatest moments in the entire franchise of Star Trek, and is essential to the collection of any Star Trek fan. I recommend this especially to casual fans, as Star Trek does not get much better than this.",1222732800,,1193,4.87192118226601
7805464,5,6300213137,"In the 1960s, the phrase ""balance of terror"" referred to the standoff between the USA, Russia, and China. In classic Trek, there is similarly a standoff with the Romulans. This episode shows Kirk deciding to pre-emptively attack a Romulan ship to avoid galactic war. In this episode and much later in ""The Enterprise Episode,"" pre-emptive strike against the Romulans succeeds. Yet this contradicts the dominant Trek pattern in which starting or extending a military conflict is unwise. (Compare: Arena, Errand of Mercy, A Private Little War, Day of the Dove.) At least McCoy is on board to argue against pre-emptive attack. In later episodes, but not this one, he would be proven right.

The Romulan commander is especially well played as a captain who privately hates war as much as anyone, but does his duty... echoed in some ways years later by the Russian sub commander in ""Hunt for Red October."" The allusions to ancient Rome are rather obvious (the centurian, the planets Romulus and Remus) and not too plausible. They are consistent with the great interest ST writers often showed in classical civilzation.

If there was ever any question as to what made the Enterprise fly -- that is, what made the original series (despite mediocre initial ratings) among the most beloved shows in TV history -- this episode settles the question. It was the writing, first and foremost. Paul Schneider's script deals simultaneously with racism, love, loss, war, and peace, setting up all the conflicts brilliantly and then resolving them all 1-2-3 in the final scenes.

On a simple level, it's a space battle with the Romulans. The many-layered conflicts aboard ship give the episode its power. This is the first time we see Romulans, and Spock's uncanny resemblance creates a problem. (Even more suspiciously, the Romulan commander is played by Mark Leonard -- Spock's father!!!)

There are a few flaws in this episode, but the drama is so strong that these flaws are easily overlooked. At one point, both sets of crewmembers whisper while the two ships try to hide their respective positions, even though there is no way sound can travel in space. And the production crew had yet to figure out the difference between phasers and photon torpedoes. But in the words of the great Joe E. Brown, nobody's perfect.",1184630400,,2302,4.9714285714285715
7805465,5,6300213137,"Brilliant piece of Start Trek Classic with script and performance that put modern day drama, sci-fi and movie, to shame. Creator and Producer Gene Roddenberry developed a timeless piece of art here. Much of the cinematography and drama were borrowed from here to produce another top trek creation ""The Wrath of Kahn"" movie.  Performances from Shatner were excellent, and even better from Mark Leonard playing the honourable, brave and philosophical Romulan Captain. The scene near the end with the Romulan Captain's final words of respect to his worthy adversary, Kirk, shown from Kirks eye view through the Enterprise view screen, is profound and delivered with such an ""oscarly"" standard of insight and inspiration that it could not have been more faithful to truth if it were real.  Every time you watch this episode you somehow hope, that this time it could end differently, every bit as much as Kirk and the Romulan Captain do.",1133308800,2,932,5.045454545454546
7805466,5,6300213137,"Following the order that the original series episodes were initially broadcast on television this was the first encounter with a known enemy of the Federation.  Since embarking on their five year exploratory mission the crew of the Enterprise has found the majestic expanse of space to be something less than sensorily austere.  It seems that trouble has no difficulty in locating the ship and putting its brave and bold crew 'to the test'.  The trouble, of course, has so far always come in the form of alien contact - be it life forms, spores of unknown origin, technology, etc.  This episode set aside the theme of exploration and involved the crew in an event they are more intimately acquainted with but which is just as deadly - common warfare.

As the episode opens Captain Kirk is about to perform a wedding ceremony, reminding those gathered of what a special privilege it is for ship's captains.  A red alert broadcast over the intercom sends everyone scrambling back to their duty stations.  A series of earth outposts constructed along 'The Neutral Zone' has not been heard from save one of them who reports they are under attack.  Further communication with Outpost 4 reveals that two of the outposts have been completely destroyed and that they are under attack themselves.  The Enterprise, out of range and unable to help the outpost, observes the last phase of the attack on their viewer seeing what is described as a type of plasma weapon.  Afterwards the enemy vessel completely disappears from view while still onscreen - a cloaking device opines Spock.  Also the markings seen on the vessel undoubtedly confirm it is a Romulan warship, a fact volunteered by the ship's navigator Lt. Stiles.  Stiles had lost several ancestors in a war with the Romulans a century before, and that conflict led to the establishment of 'The Neutral Zone' both sides not wanting further contact with the other.  During that war no one had seen what a Romulan looked like since there was no facial confrontation so they remain a bit of a mystery.  Through the magic of technology Spock is able to pirate a view of the enemy ship's bridge and the Romulans look strikingly similar to Vulcans - a fact that has Lt. Stiles behaving like a bigot as the episode progresses.  The two ships play out their cat-and-mouse game with each ship overcoming damage and losses and each ship's captain outguessing the other until the 'point of no return' is passed.

I don't know if the creative staff planned it this way but having the moment of the wedding destroyed and simultaneously putting the crew into a war situation, shatters their romantic illusions of space travel.  When Sulu interrupts the wedding with a red alert that has everyone reporting back to their duty stations and to prepare for possible battle it ruins the idyllic moment of the ceremony.  Up until this moment of the series the Enterprise had been engaged on an exploration mission, which we have seen presented onscreen as a great adventure, not completely without dangers but still, a sort of romantic illusion to the potential dangers that they may actually be encountering has been the underlying thought process.  Now a long silent enemy has come out of dormancy with a vengeance and changed the way they see the universe - a kind of 'wakeup call' in a way.

There are many great moments in 'Balance Of Terror' and most of them have been recounted in the other reviews.  The Romulans show themselves to be shrewd and cunning warriors, an enemy that will become a thorn in the side of the Federation for years to come.  All of the actors portraying them give credible and exemplary performances.  The characterizations of the Enterprise crew are quite exceptional too; never for a moment did the show lag, the fear and apprehension a ship's crew would experience is played out intensely.  It's not a wonder this is a fan favorite.

Some final notes: If I had one complaint about this episode it was the use of the 'silent running' technique which is utilized by submarines.  Every schoolboy knows that sound doesn't travel in a vacuum - and that's exactly what outer space is, a vacuum.  Also, I don't know if anyone else noticed but after just finishing watching this show I couldn't help but observe that every time the Enterprise fires it's lasers a clip of the ship firing photon torpedoes is used.  Realizing that this was an episode that was produced fairly early in sequence it is understandable (and forgivable) that such an oversight occurred.  Additionally, having the bulk of the Romulans wearing helmets in this episode must have helped out with the budget quite a bit - a clever way to avoid creating multiple pointed-ear applications!",1093132800,,4711,4.824626865671642
7805467,5,6300213137,"This is one of the finest of all the original Star Trek episodes.  Because of budget constraints, the original series had to emphasize acting and quality scripts and less on ""gee-whiz"" special effects that have made the subsequent follow-up Star Treks much poorer in quality than the original.  Mark Lenard puts in a superb performance as the tragic Romulan commander, a man of integrity serving a totalitarian dictatorship , similar to two other great warriors serving bad causes, knowing that they are in the wrong, but still compelled to fulfill their duty as they saw it knowing it would lead to disaster--General Robert E Lee and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.
All the dilemmas and challenges of a military commander are seen in this episode: trying to outguess the enemy, insubordination, the necessity to disobey orders from above, the loss of comrades.

7805468,5,6300213137,"Mark Lenard makes a memorable first appearance on Star Trek as the Romulan commander in ""Balance of Terror.""  This episode is pretty much a classic submarine story updated to outer space, made compelling by the cat and mouse game between the two captains.  Kirk is performing a wedding but is interrupted by news that several Earth Outposts have been attacked by a cloaked ship firing a plasma weapon.  The Enterprise goes in pursuit of the Romulan vessel.  When Spock pirates a view of the Romulan bridge we learn that this is the first time anyone from Starfleet has ever seen the Romulans, so there is some surprise that they look like Vulcans.  The sub-plot involving Lt. Stiles, who distrusts Spock because of the physical comparison, shows that even in the Star Trek universe envisioned by Gene Roddenberry, human prejudice is still going strong.  ""Balance of Terror"" does a nice job of working out the moves and counter moves in the running battle.  Lenard brings a wonderful sense of dignity to his role and it is obvious from his first scene why they would take any opportunity to bring him back.  That he was given the plumb role of Sarek was a fitting reward.  I also think this is the point in the first season where William Shatner clearly has a handle on Kirk as the best starship captain in Starfleet.  Also, as grating as the Spock/Stiles subplot happens to be, the bracketing subplot about the wedding is one of the better story lines involving those unfortunate extras who die all the time on Star Trek.  Still, this is an episode that deservedly ends up on most fans' top ten episode lists.  I know it is on mine.",1002067200,4,1632,4.648083623693379
7805469,5,6300213137,"This is another classic episode of Star Trek and one of my top 5 favorites.  It gives us a ""first"" glimpse at the Federations mortal enemy the Romulans (Romulan Empire) and my goodness they also look like Vulcans!?!?!  Well, that is answered in episodes yet to come in upcoming series (The Next Generation).
This begins when a mysterious ship is destroying Federation Outposts and James Kirk and the USS Enterprise soon discover it is their classic enemies the Romulans.  What follows is a classic strategic cat and mouse ""game"" that is like the movie ""The Enemy Below"" that starred Robert Mitchum as a WWII US Destroyer Captain and Kurt Jergens as a German U-Boat Commander.  The Jergens part in this episode is played oustandingly by the late Mark Lenard.  You can guess who plays Mitchum's part, why of course James T. Kirk (William Shatner).
Both of these Captains start to have a respect for each others skills and the best line of the episode is when the Romulan Commander tells Kirk, ""in another reality we could of been friends"".  Talk about respect, that says it all dosen't it?
Overall, this is a classic episode and highly recommended to all Star Trek fans.",999561600,6,1168,4.757425742574258
