2390994,4,B000ARXFBO,We chose this to refresh our ballroom basics. It is very clear to understand both the male and female parts. The best part of this video is where they show how to incorporate the basic steps into the different styles of dance.,1324425600,,226,4.404761904761905
2390995,5,B000ARXFBO,The video is very helpful to learn dance steps. The presentation is good and the dvd can easly be skipped forward or backwards allow for repeat attempts.,1321920000,8,153,4.703703703703703
2390996,4,B000ARXFBO,"At the ripe old age of 42, I am young enough to remember my college summers going to the free MidSummer Night Swing events at Lincoln Center where I learned the basics of salsa right in front of Celia Cruz. I'm also old enough now to have a couple of joint replacements and to not know half of the ""stars"" on Dancing With the Stars. One thing has never changed, I love dance - whether just watching on a ""bad day"" or participating on a good day. For a wedding anniversary several years ago I was lucky enough to have a private dance lesson taught by Melanie LaPatin at a studio in NYC; she is extremely personable; knows not only how to dance but also how to *teach*! Tony Meredith is equally effective in demonstrating the male partner's steps.

The dance moves are demonstrated clearly and slowly from several different angles without music in the beginning which is great to have less distraction while you're taking your first steps; the moves are demonstrated separately for the male and female parts which is helpful for a true beginner and learning solo. Takes you through correct posture and holds to the basic box step to putting it all together in the Foxtrot, Rumba and others. The music CD included for practicing is a nice bonus.

I'll admit the dialog sometimes reminds me a bit of an infomercial - a lot of ""It's soooo easy!!!! Now wasn't that easy!?!?"".... applause.... it would probably all seem a bit saccharine but somehow comes off as kitschy fun when delivered by Melanie and Tony - gotta love them!

Recommended for beginners.",1320019200,6,1548,4.621818181818182
2390997,5,B000ARXFBO,"Thought it was great. I like that there is a music CD
with it so you can pratice on your own.",1302652800,18,93,3.4761904761904763
2390998,5,B000ARXFBO,This is a great Dance Instruction Video!  We have a group in a Retirement Community and they all loved it!  This couple is fun to watch!  I purchased a new DVD for my Granddaughter who has just become engaged.  They plan to use it for their Wedding Dance Practicing!  All ages can learn from this and enjoy it!,1281139200,2,310,4.275862068965517
2390999,5,B000ARXFBO,"The hosts of this DVD are photogenic and very personable, and I liked the ""studio audience"" format of the instruction with a live audience. Their visual aids are easy to reproduce at home as well as genuinely helpful to the material presented. The steps presented aren't always the ""normal"" ones presented on ballroom dancing instruction videos, but which really do make ballroom dancing so full of flair, like sideways steps and twirls. While searching for an ""ideal"" instruction video, I've seen several that didn't cover any of this stuff even though it's what I'm really interested in learning!

The hosts really do make this video, though. They are likeable and funny, and quite knowledgable. The audience is happy to participate as well. Overall I was very happy with this video.",1257552000,13,785,5.038461538461538
2391000,1,B000ARXFBO,"Do not like the product. Old fashion ballroom dancing, not the modern 2009 type my friends are doing.",1252627200,3,101,4.666666666666667
2391001,5,B000ARXFBO,"Great introduction to ballroom dancing.  Clear, easy to follow.  Very likable teachers.  Men and women's parts illustrated clearly and effectively.

2391002,3,B000ARXFBO,"I got this DVD as a birthday present.  It individually teaches the male and female dance parts, then puts them together.  It first teaches a box step, turning box, as well as different variations.  Then it shows how some of the moves apply to the waltz, rumba, and other dances.  It's easy to learn, and it's not complicated to do.  This is a good DVD to get started learning ballroom dancing.",1141344000,63,393,4.47887323943662
2391003,5,B000ARXFBO,"A bit advanced for me, but well done.",1418860800,,37,3.75
2391004,1,B000ARXFBO,It is a dark video. Some of the female steps are not taught.  I am a beginner so I expected teaching of both dance parts.,1406160000,,121,3.84
2391005,5,B000ARXFBO,"Best I've seen for beginning dancers. Posture and frame are discussed, and shows how each move taught can transfer to other dances, like Foxtrot or Rumba just by changing rhythm. Good body mechanics ands shows footwork and foot placement. You can learn a lot and review good technique.",1405900800,9,285,4.958333333333333
2391006,5,B000ARXFBO,"I love this DVD. This couple is very precise in their instruction. Even basic beginners like my husband and I were able to follow and learn with ease. Anyone who has never done ballroom dancing but wants to learn, this is the right tool to start with. We are currently taking lessons from a professional instructor but this helps us with our practice at home. The instructions are almost identical to those of our class instructor, so there is no conflict of style or form. Great!",1402358400,6,480,4.593023255813954
2391007,4,B000ARXFBO,"This instructional DVD was great for me and my dance partner. We enjoyed the lesson conversation and easy explanation's of the steps and how to put it all together. I did read what others said about other DVD's before I chose one. I think I made the perfect choice. I plan to purchase a more advanced DVD as I progress, and will look for Melanie LaPatin's again.",1391644800,7,362,4.417910447761194
2391008,5,B000ARXFBO,I loved the square box explanations. I recomend it. I bought it used but I got it like a new one.,1389398400,,97,3.6666666666666665
2391009,2,B000ARXFBO,"My wife and I take professional ballroom classes and thought this would be something nice to help us learn but I was sadly disappointed.
It's super basic it doesn't teach real dance patterns and it's only meant for those with no experience and those that will never take professional lessons",1376611200,2,291,4.84
2391010,5,B000ARXFBO,These guys have a nice way about them and they teach in a friendly and easily followed way.  We really enjoyed this DVD.,1369612800,,120,4.217391304347826
2391011,5,B000ARXFBO,I like it. It is great for people who want to start from ABC. It is so encouraging for beginners,1368316800,4,96,3.85
2391012,4,B000ARXFBO,"This is a very good, very basic dance DVD for those who do not know how to dance at all.",1366243200,,88,3.45
2391013,3,B000ARXFBO,Gives you the basic steps but doesn't reallly treach you any dances.  I am taking dance lessons and thought it might augment them but it did not.,1365120000,9,145,4.37037037037037
2391014,5,B000ARXFBO,"Great video, easy to follow, easy to practice with, gives you all the basics,more valuable than $600 worth of lessons at Arthur Murray",1364428800,,134,4.869565217391305
2391015,5,B000ARXFBO,"THEY SHOW YOU STEP BY STEP WHAT TO DO,.......I BOUGHT IT TO SEE IF IT WILL HELP WITH MY  BALANCE......I AM

2391016,4,B000ARXFBO,We use this as practice so we don't forget our dancing lessons.  We watch and then dance along with the video.,1362787200,,110,4.238095238095238
2391017,4,B000ARXFBO,It was very easy to follow and gave instructions for the basic dance steps.  It's really a big help with posture.,1360454400,,113,4.380952380952381
2391018,2,B000ARXFBO,"The premise of this video is that you can move to the beat of the music; here are four steps (plus the underarm turn and the dip) to help you move.  The steps work pretty well when you hear music and you want to move your feet while dancing with a partner. The DVD demonstrates the Box Step, Turning Box Step, Hesitation Step and the Whisk Pattern. It alleges to demonstrate steps of the Waltz, Foxtrot, Merengue, Sway, Samba and Rumba. (I'm sure all of those dances use one of the demonstrated moves; that's all I will say for a rating of two stars.) There is a music CD of twelve songs with the dance they demonstrate clearly labeled.  If there is only room for one instructional DVD about Ballroom Dancing in your budget, this is enough.",1358208000,5,740,4.394160583941606
2391019,5,B000ARXFBO,Super fun to use in the classroom. I learned along with my students! Very informative and very fun. Would buy more!,1357344000,,115,4.523809523809524
2391020,4,B000ARXFBO,"I like that both the men's and women's parts are broken down and shown separately.
It is basic and doesn't have a lot of extra's. I thought it was well done.",1353801600,,157,4.096774193548387
2391021,5,B000ARXFBO,I'm teaching my new gentleman friend how to dance and this DVD has been a very easy to follow tutorial.  It has been very well done and we are thoroughly enjoying it!,1328486400,5,166,4.1875
2391022,5,B000ARXFBO,"There are other great instructional video's but this one is the place to start for those couples with zero dance skills who need to start from square one (literally!). clear, simple directions for both the male and female partner to learn and then combined together. i'm sure we will graduate to other video's but will always be glad we got our first lessons from these two experts. thanks to them for their patience and understanding that there are folks out there with two left feet that need it broken down to the simplest of instruction. after this video we were able to chuck the steel toed boots and wear real dancing shoes while practicing together!",1327190400,3,656,4.71304347826087

8079340,4,B000ARXFBO,"Got it in preparation for the first dance at our wedding... A little cheese, but a good beginners introduction to dancing. The program is a little dated, but I think that adds to the fun. The dvd also lets you jump to the section you are looking for which is helpful. I would recommend as there is a lot of content on the dvd. Also the version I got came with a cd of music so you can try the dances with basic music.",1515456000,,417,3.9761904761904763
8079341,4,B000ARXFBO,Good for learning 6 basic ballroom steps. I would recommend but know it's only six or seven moves.,1502323200,,98,4.5
