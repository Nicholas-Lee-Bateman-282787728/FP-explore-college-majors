8415521,5,B0043ZNMK8,"Being a Mr. Big fan since they opened for Rush in 1990, Pat has always been in my top 5 of inspirational drummers. His enthusiasm & energy are just infectious. In this video, he goes over it all: footwork, fills, time you name it. The jams with Billy really add to the overall quality because you can see how he uses what he's teaching in practical application.
It's a little dated, & not much has been seen video wise from Pat in a while. But one can get past that in that what you see here, he still does even now. Mr. Big is back with What If... and you can see all of what you see on this video on stage.
Recommended highly.",1322956800,,628,4.07258064516129
