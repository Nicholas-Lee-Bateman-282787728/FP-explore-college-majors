8639841,2,B00I8OESEO,"Ordered, & received this movie within a week from Amazon - the DVD was in good condition & played fine.

it is a documentary style movie containing interviews.

I hope there will be more documentaries like this, but with even more who are coping with living & working, appearing 'normal' . . .",1482278400,,293,4.509433962264151

8639844,1,B00I8OESEO,"This film purports to be an exploration of autism. It is not. These people are not autistic. A few have what is now called high-functioning autism. Two definitely are not autistic, and more likely have social anxiety with underlying sensory integration deficits. The others are techies and like many of the wonderful geeks I went to college with. Others have developmental disorders, comorbid with Asperger's.

A major problem today is that autism has become a spectrum disorder. Basically, geeks who don't quite understand social interaction to the level that they would like to can call themselves autistic. These are traits in the general population, when taken with environmental factors, prenatal environment, and genes, that produce true autism (what is now referred to as low-functioning ASD). I work with autistic children. Autism is a serious disorder--it's clear when you see it, and you don't even have to ask.

This film fails at its task. Watch the documentary on Temple Grandin on youtube. How is she different than the people in this film? She clearly had neurological challenges and sensory integration challenges from an early age that we see in more severe low functioning autism. At the root of autism are neurological processing and direction, and sensory integration challenges, not just difficulty picking up social cues as this film suggests.",1413158400,13,1365,5.256880733944954

8639846,3,B00I8OESEO,"It's not bad. It is lacking key info to make Asperger's properly described buy ALL of those who say what it is. Some, of whom, are adults on the spectrum. And those people, with the exception of 1 or 2, quite honestly don't describe it well, at ALL. And some of how it's described, is plainly, factually inaccurate. Most of the people who describe it, do it, anywhere from very badly too somewhat. And that's just plain, wrong. If  you want to show people off the spectrum being ignorant that's okay, maybe. But, don't highlight them without saying it's incomplete or the wrong info. Not 1 person is super clear on what is, and accurate in a complete picture kind of way.

  This is coming from an adult, female, aspie who's a writer, sensory solutions advocate, and disabilities advocate. And who now has too blogs.  Both of which highlight high functioning ASD. sensorysolutions1.com and disabilityadvocate1.com .",1407542400,11,915,4.839743589743589
