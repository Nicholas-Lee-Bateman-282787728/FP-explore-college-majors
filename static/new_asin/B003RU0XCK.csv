Oil City Confidential is the third and final entry in Julien Temple's masterful trilogy of films focusing on the 1070's British rock and roll bands he considers important:

The Filth And The Fury (The Sex Pistols)

The Future Is Unwritten (Joe Strummer / The Clash)

Oil City Confidential (Dr. Feelgood)

Many Americans are up to speed on the Sex Pistols and very familiar with the Clash but probably missed out on Dr. Feelgood. In short: Dr. Feelgood was an absolutely intense, less is more, R&B band that as part of the Pub Rock movement helped to kick down the doors of the British music industry and pave the way for Punk Rock. This was a band that helped blaze the trail of Pub shows (providing a circuit for the coming Punk bands to play) and demonstrating to the likes of Joe Strummer and others that you did not need to have long-blonde tresses, silk robes, a lyrical fondness for J.R.R. Tolkein and mastery of the zither to make it in rock and roll.

The biography of this band is fascinating and hilarious but the live footage is absolutely riveting. The combination of Wilko Johnson and Lee Brilleaux on stage is an absolute one-off. Makes you wish you were there.

One interesting point: The Filth and The Fury and The Future is Unwritten are easily available on these shores and show up on cable regularly. I have never been able to find Oil City Confidential on my DVR so I broke down and bought it. THIS IS A REGION 2 DVD: That means you will need a region free DVD player or you can most likely play it on your computer. In my case, I ripped the files and watched it on my HD TV via a streaming device.

I wish this was a Region 1 DVD (kind of absurd that it isn't) but Dr. Feelgood is worth the extra work.",1337040000,,1851,4.3604651162790695
4186308,4,B003RU0XCK,"Centred on Wilko Johnson, this band bio is packed with detail and music clips and archive film. It conveys the ""in your face"" culture and humour of the grim Essex flatlands.  Wilko is especially moving; a restless, worried, brave, difficult, isolated soul, he takes us on a physical and chronological walk through the years of Dr. Feelgood, constantly balancing depression and anxiety with chippy challenging blue-collar wit.

During their time, the band obviously answered an urgent hunger need among a young audience who were estranged, if not shut out,  from the 70's glamour/progressive/hippie pop music scene. They identified with Wilko: a working class lad who'd gone to university to study English Literature, but dropped out to restate his cultural loyalty to Canvey Island.  In fact Wilko drops a few choice Wordsworth and Milton lines into his commentary.

One niggle: the sound levels on this DVD are annoyingly erratic; an editor assembling this collage should have done better.

Memorable words: English viewers will grin and recognize when Wilko announces ""We come from Canvey Island"" is using the PAST tense.

4186309,5,B003RU0XCK,"I am a Dr. Feelgood fan from the 70's,i was up late one night and Oil City Confidential came on the Documentary Channel, I was very happy and sad ,they were a great band that didn't get the recognition they deserved!! (in america at least).I'll always remember them on the roadtrips we would take to the motorcycle races!! they were always the 1ST tape to go into the cassette deck!! thanks always Dr. Feelgood,and to Lee wherever you are!!",1329609600,2,440,4.582278481012659
4186310,4,B003RU0XCK,"Great movie! beside the band story, the movie takes you in the London's close-by blue-collar suburb, with a striking view of reality and normal people struggle and love of the place they live in.
Beware: the DVD is EU format ! :(",1322956800,6,229,4.476190476190476

8403879,5,B003RU0XCK,"I was a huge fan of Wilko Johnson & Dr Feelgood back in the 70's. Was even lucky enough to see them play in Philly and they
blew me away. So I was very interested in having any live footage of the band. This DVD has performances but stands out
more as a ""history"" of the band and Canvey Island as well. While I would have liked more live footage, I would still recommend
this DVD to Feelgood fans or to fans of rock & roll.",1402876800,4,423,3.9302325581395348
8403880,5,B003RU0XCK,"Fantastic documentary about a wonderful, mostly unsung band.

For anyone who loves great rock 'n' roll and wants to know where British punk began - right on Canvey Island.

Long live Lee & Wilko!",1390176000,3,195,4.705882352941177
8403881,5,B003RU0XCK,"Just saw this recently and cannot recommend it highly enough. This is a wonderful documentary that manages to transcend all of the things it is about: Dr. Feelgood; economic and cultural dead ends in small, industrial cities; local boys making good; the rise and fall of a band; how success can rip apart friendships; belated appreciation of overlooked artists; you can take the boys out of Canvy, but you can't take the Canvy out of the boys. These are some of the parts, but not the sum of the parts.

The synopsis is above the reviews here and I'll not bother to rewrite it. I will say simply that this is an engaging, funny and very moving experience, whether you are a fan of Dr. Feelgood or not. I will also wager that anyone who has even the slightest love of rock and roll will love Dr. Feelgood after seeing this. The film is a visual treat as well, with the intercuts from some classic (and not nearly so classic) British films from the 40s and 50s which have nothing and everything to do with the story being told.

Only one caveat: May require stopping and backing up now and again. To US ears, some of the accents can be tough to decipher on first listen. But what they have to say, and how they say it are worth the effort (and a lot more). Very likely a film you'll want to own and pull out just every now and again. At the very least, see it once.",1379462400,14,1363,4.27906976744186
8403882,5,B003RU0XCK,"I got this film not knowing much at all about the boys...now I have a real impression of how they grew up, started in bands, their characters, musical influences....FAB interview with Lee Brilleaux, explores the 70s blues rock scene, fascinating and very well put together............if u want to know ALL about the Feelgoods, u will be DELIGHTED !!!  Run time around 2hrs30mins",1371945600,,378,5.096774193548387
8403883,5,B003RU0XCK,"A great film. I just bought a compilation of the Wilko Johnson years and can't wait to hear it!

Like Temple's other rock docs, you don't have to be familiar with the subject to enjoy this film.",1366329600,,194,4.243243243243243
8403884,5,B003RU0XCK,"...to a very old friend. At least that is how it feels. You see this is certainly a documentary about the early years of Dr. Feelgood and there is plenty to learn and enjoy at an absolute standpoint. However, if you wanted to know how it felt to have known Wilco Johnson for years then suddenly find yourself with him sitting on your sofa telling you where he's been for the last fortysomething years, then this is how you do it, short of banging on his front door and probably annoying him (he still lives in Canvey Island). So the life of the Feelgoods becomes real and placed in a huge perspective that takes in the viewpoints of all of the four, plus Chris the van driver (explained in the movie) - especially touching to see Lee Brilleaux (and find out how he got that name as he was born Lee Collinson...), catching his perspective before his untimely death (1994) as well as those that knew them (Lee's mum!). In some ways it is a study of Canvey Island (actually a beautiful place - really!) that just happens to morph into a story about a bunch of lads who 'got famous'. Ok, enough of my ramblings. Sit down, enjoy and just wallow in the true friendship that wafts out of this masterpice!",1337817600,2,1197,4.396396396396397
