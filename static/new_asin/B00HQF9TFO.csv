6196028,5,B00HQF9TFO,"Time Runners is a complex, taut foray into a surprising variety of questions--temporal, political and psychological, all within the time travel science-fiction genre. The story involves a protagonist with powers that may not seem so special: the ability to rewind time for nine seconds. But what a lot of fun director Tom Durham has with that. Violent forces are willing to do ruthless things to harness that power. And painful things occur because this power gives Sally the impression she can control all aspects of her life.

Like all good stories, and certainly all great science-fiction, Time Runners examines some of the big questions: the potentialities and perils of time travel, the triumphs and trials of love, and the nature of free will itself. If you like gritty time travel riddles, watch closely because the questions (and answers) are there. Why does Sally have the ability to warp time? Why are the temporal anomalies happening? Why would nefarious suits chase her with guns blazing? Why is she seeing the time ghost of her missing husband? What is the great future war about?

Even more important for Sally is the examination of her own struggles with relationships. This is not your average heroine. Despite herself, Sally cares, and she doesn't necessarily like that she cares. It is a rare film which depicts that there is only one way to experience real love: by opening your heart to the inevitable vulnerability to pain genuine relationships bring.

Finally, Time Runners is about free will, that the most important question we must answer is what we choose to do moment by moment. In fact, Time Runners argues that the very fabric of existence is not matter, but human choice.  This is, to my knowledge, a concept unique in the history of film. Naturally, all this takes place while Sally is pursued by those who would just as soon kill her as apprehend her if they could be sure it wouldn't interfere with even bigger plans. They are powerful because they don't care about lives; Sally is powerful because she does.

This is an intense, contained movie. While the scale of the production is perhaps not epic in the same sense of, say, Star Wars, the questions examined could not be more vast and meaningful.",1397692800,5,2233,4.86578947368421
6196029,5,B00HQF9TFO,"I will admit up front that I was one of the Kickstarter supporters who donated a few dollars to help complete this film based upon a short trailer. As a result I was able to watch an early version of the final film and I must say that it exceeded my expectations. I feel that it is quite good for an indie production. Great special effects, a good story and a very subtle pro life message. My entire family watched and enjoyed the film. 95ers Time Runners is an intelligent human drama clothed in a science fiction universe. Sure, it borrows concepts pioneered in other films, but what movie doesn't these days. If this final cut remains true to the version that I saw, I would rate it PG for infrequent mild language, action and gun play.  I have pre-ordered a copy from Amazon.",1397433600,2,779,4.409722222222222
6196030,5,B00HQF9TFO,"I have to state right up front that I am very pleasantly surprised with 95ERS: TIME RUNNERS.  When I first read the press release, my interest was piqued because I like time travel concepts, and Im always interested to see how writers try to overcome the whole paradox issue.  Many times, they completely disregard the issue, choosing instead to focus on the story instead of the science.  But 95ERS: TIME RUNNERS does an excellent job of fleshing out a way to bypass the paradoxical issues and focus on a riveting plot line at the same time.

From my experience, most lower-budget time-travel movies are a bust.  In some, the special effects are simply too cheap and distracting to enjoy the story.  And in others, the plot suffers because all of the budget was spent on flashy effects.  But that is not the case here; this film blends a nice balance of both story and special effects.

95ERS: TIME RUNNERS is shot fairly well and actually looks good onscreen.  Some of the futuristic CG animation looks like video game quality, but it still looks impressive nonetheless.  The timeline effects steal the show, though, and I have to truly commend the production team on them.  Ive never seen a visual interpretation of timeline-tracking like this, but it is both unique and vibrant.  As such, I had no problems believing in this aspect of the time travel concept.

The storyline of the film is what really wins me over with this one, though.  This is a thinking-mans time travel story, and its about time we had a good one.  With that being said, you really have to pay attention to whats happening to truly understand the film.  You cannot idly watch the film and expect to comprehend.  But if you can devote your full attention to it, everything should click.

95ERS: TIME RUNNERS is a definite win for me, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  The science alone is enough of a reason to check it out; much of what is presented in the film is based on research that is currently underway.  Therefore, who knows how feasible this might be in the future?  Regardless, give this film a chance for sure.",1397433600,129,2105,4.619946091644205
6196031,5,B00HQF9TFO,"Any time a sci-fi movie is made with so much passion and such big ideas---even if the budget doesn't quite reach its lofty goals---sci-fi fans need to pay attention.  95ers is something special, and could be the beginning of a fabulous new franchise.

It's about an FBI agent with time-bending powers investigating paranormal incidents that may have something to do with her missing husband.  Meanwhile, she's being hunted by forces from the future.  Everything's connected to some big mysteries, including her powers.  There are some familiar time travel concepts---and also some extremely original (and deeply quantum) ones connected to the wildly cool and mysterious ""95ers"" universe.  The pacing is a bit slow at times, but each scene is so packed with well-planned detail you won't mind.  There are lots of interesting threads, including bit of ""A Christmas Carol""...

The performances, production value, visual effects, etc. are decent... stunningly decent given its budget.  The star Alesandra Durham deftly pulls off multifaceted role, and Ian Freeth (the time navigator) and Terence Goodman (the bad guy) are very entertaining.

This is one that makes you work, one that means something.  Huzzay for indie sci-fi!

The film is unrated, but definitely less than R.",1397433600,2,1272,5.305

There was great potential in the story, but there were many things in the movie that were not explained, clear to understand, and possibly, relevant to the story.  The acting itself was okay, but the story just never quite felt like it was very thought-through.  The filmmaking style felt like either something out of the 1980s, or just a misguided effort at trying to show shifts in time (this was done by backing up a frame or two in the middle of movement, and just did not work).

I loved the addition of real things like the particle accelerator; that shot of a particle collision was quite nice too.

We are used to slicker productions.  However, even though I wanted to hate the movie for its poor production values and bad acting, I couldn't.

I was fascinated: I couldn't stop watching it. I haven't felt that way about a movie since Predestination.

Otherwise, I probably would have bailed after the first 30 minutes.  The story premise is certainly tried and true, but so many other movies have done it so much better (Time After Time, Butterfly Effect, Time Traveller's Wife).  Director (and lucky man) Tom Durham (Alesandra's husband) explains the ""physics"" of the premise in such a mish-mash convoluted way, I didn't get it until more than half way through the movie.  The ""95"" thing isn't explained until then, and by then, you're nodding off with the snoozer script (except Alesandra was keeping me awake).  There is an aura of amateurishness in the camera work and editing that is hard to suspend belief on, so was continually running alternate ways I would have directed the movie that would have been better.  I don't like that.  The bummer is, this could be a really great story with a better director, better acting, better script, better cinematography, better effects.  Which brings me around to the special effects, which were very 1980s.  Ironically, the best acting in this movie was done by the actors who were pretending to be acting (subplot of a community theater production of ""Scrooge"").  Alesandra's beauty just barely makes up for her one-note emotion she used for her part. But this is just bad directing--probably hard to be directed by your husband, I guess.  Anywho, I probably won't watch this mess again, but I will look for Alesandra in other movies....",1434585600,,1552,4.908045977011494

6196240,3,B00HQF9TFO,"""Target is Rift Born, Class One - female voice in the future of 95ers: Time Runners""

Three FASCINATING Stars. 95ers"" is a time travel' movie with excellent actors, an interesting plot, and unique CGI effects created to display unusual 'time-travel characteristics, and some scenes from a future battle. The plot shifts between a present day scientist and his gifted wife and a future reality where a war is underway, but no clear explanation is given about the opponents and about the conflict. The scientist disappears and the pregnant wife must continue working in a job for the FBI, amid unusual events around her at certain locales that focus her investigations. The writers needed to tie up the many loose ends, explain the colloquial jargon, and produce a bigger 'pay off' at the end even when the ""big reveal took place. This one had all of the necessary components-actors, locales, sets, direction, and most of a script, it just needed to identify the opposing forces in the conflict, the point of contention, and the elements stated above to make more sense. Even so, it stayed interesting to the very end as the anticipation built. Starring Alesandra Durham, Joel Bishop, Terence Goodman, Ian Paul Freeth, Chris Laird, and others. Directed by Thomas Gomez Durham. Recommended for 'time travel' movie fans and it is rated at Three CHALLENGING Stars! (Amazon Instant Video, NR-not rated, Close Captioned.

It wasn't that it was an exceptionally clever story or even a very original one: the whole core story is based off of A Christmas Carol. Yet those were the very reasons I liked it. It was straightforward, not confusing, and familiar. I felt like I had read this story before, and in a way I have.

Besides that, I felt compelled to buy this as a DVD to give something back to the director. The film was clearly low budget - just take a look at the actors. The director's wife plays the main character. However, the acting, filming, CGI, and story where put together with such skill that I could still lose myself in the story without getting caught on inconsistencies or cheesy scenes.

The 95ers in title is really strange as they never really pursue it in the plot other to show these time paradox explosions roughly lying along US route 95 corridor near Washington, DC.

The future is plagued by imminent destruction and so a time traveller is ""sent back"" to correct the arrow of time to prevent the nasty future from developing.  The plot never goes into how the future is tied to past actions as was amply done with the Terminator series.

This movie has paid special attention to detail regarding the construction of the story, as well as the construction of the various time lines. But if you have no interest in such then I suggest you skip this movie, it has nothing to offer you. This is a movie for those who are open to the expanding of their paradigm regarding reality.

This has become one of my favorite movies. Now because it's independent it doesn't have all the special effects and top acting that we have become accustomed to. However, this movie is very thought provoking.

It's critical to listen to the dialog that goes on between the characters. I got even more out of the movie after seeing it a second time.

Overall I'd say that this is a great movie and that it has done what it was designed to do. It has caused me to begin seeing the world in such a way that I had never seen it before.",1428796800,2,985,4.28494623655914

6196416,5,B00HQF9TFO,"This is one the first movies I have watched that featured time travel and made it believable. Think of this as Star Trek with a lot more science words thrown in and I mean a lot. Fortunately or unfortunately, I graduated from The Georgia Institute of Technology and I understood all the mumbo-jumbo science words. I did not catch any technical errors because they really didn't say any facts about time and quantum mechanics. They threw out a bunch of theory and remember a theory is not a law (as in the law of gravity or the theory of evolution). So from a science point, it fits. There is some science fiction, though not provable as sic-fi. That part comes in when some very rare people are labeled as a 95er. The name comes from I-95, a highway running north and south on the east coast of the United States. They have the ability to turn time back and the main 95er in this case, can turn it back up to nine seconds. If people like this existed, who could prove it? In the movie there is a way... stop. Watch the movie if I intrigued you enough but remember, this movie does not have ""Titanic"" like budget and the special effects and future scape is well done on such a low budget. (Oh, I wish they could have spent millions on this movie and kept the same actors.)

The bad is unfortunately for some of the non-main characters' acting but that is easily overlooked.

The lead actor did an incredible job and I assume that her real life husband or possibly brother was also a huge part of the movie behind the camera. I can't state enough about their work on this movie. I wish I could name all the writers...etc. but kudos to everyone in the film. Thank goodness it was edited well. All the parts are a must to understand the film. It works! I would love to see a Time Runners II!

If you do watch this film, watch through the first part of the credits and you'll get an easter egg, one that I noticed already but nice to have it confirmed.

Except I couldn't.

Don't get me wrong, this is no ""Terminator,"" but I was surprised at how well I enjoyed the film.

The writing is solid, the acting is solid, the plot is not filled with too many holes, but most of all, it was just plain fun to watch.

And, aside from the spaceship/airplane/what-the-hell-is-that-supposed-to-be-in-the-sky attack sequences, the special effects were impressive.  Anyone who suffered through Wolverine know that a huge budget and world class special effects can leave you sorry your showed up, so it was delightful to see some fairly great effects, aside from the afore mentioned rocket ship thing-a-ma-jigs.

The story is fairly straightforward and the explanation for the plot twist is pretty cleverly done and, at times, you both hate and root for the main character, which shows a depth of plot most major films can never approach.

Best of all, I did not experience any overwhelming, ""WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU PICK UP THE GUN!"" moments.  You know what I'm talking about, those plot devices where the character defeats a bad guy and walks away from the one thing that would have ended the movie 40 minutes early.  I hate that, and I loved that The 95ers didn't suffer from such moronic lunacy.

If you are looking for a decent flick with a solid take on a time travel yarn with good characters and better acting, give this a look-see.  It's worth the price of admission.",1423612800,,1497,4.719230769230769

6196538,5,B00HQF9TFO,"I read another review stating that the acting was bad. I think that while there is a slow build-up (necessary for the level of complexity towards the end) and the main character's reactions are off, her specific reactions can be explained by her ability to redo her reactions and actions until she is happy with them. No person is a perfect or even necessarily good barometer for what they best reaction is, and she is human enough to be a bad one. Not that bad, but...it works out, along with ""suspension of disbelief.""
The special effects of the movie are not what you'd see in a large-scale production nowadays. They are by far good enough to inspire one's imagination. Someone below said that the acting was sub-par - and that may well be the case. I like 95ers because the story takes precedence over everything else in the movie, and the story is worth the delivery. You get movies like inception which are completed in every possible manner, and the end result is that I don't even know what I just watched.
After watching 95ers just once, I understand the story that was told. I'm not left wondering about anything the producers didn't mean for me to wonder about - just things like how the revealed future came about, whether the blind/black guy is the initial cause or, simply, God, and what part this mad, mentor-type scientist to Biggs plays in the plot.

6196543,3,B00HQF9TFO,"The problem with ""Independent"" movies is that ""indie"" is not synonymous with good.  It is our duty, in our youth, to rebel against the establishment,  but simply calling yourself a rebel does not build anything worthwhile.  This film is a good example of that.

A good idea that needed and ""adult"" to flesh it out.  The problem with wanting to be cutting edge is that you forget that you have an audience to deal with.  It is not just you, alone, against the ""powers that be.""  This film is a good example of a creative film making crew that forgot there was an audience watching and that even radical film makers have a responsibility to that audience.

As other reviewers have noted, the film starts out slow, and does not use that time to really establish much of anything.  No character development, no introductions, no reason to care about anyone you have seen.  The next ""jump"" has the husband dead (no spoiler) the wife pregnant and people coming into and out of her home like it is the town community center.  The writer and director hope that you will be interested enough in their radical film making ideas that you will go along with all of these first year film school mistakes.  Mistakes REAL film producers, real story tellers, do not make more than once.  When the film finally starts to pick up speed you are still given a pantheon of characters you have no clue about and no interest in.  This is a shame becasue the story is interesting, somewhat original, and would have been worth telling in the hands of story tellers.  People who realize  that ""new"" and ""good"" are not interchangeable.

As with any film of this type, the most interesting aspects are unintentional.  The most interesting character, both in story and acting ability, is the unnamed ""navigator, who must fine the best time to insert some character from the embattled future into our heroine's life.  A simple plot point, he brings interest into a simple special effect and holds the audience attention.  Something few of the other characters do.

Again, no spoiler, but why any of this happens and what was the result of all the efforts is never explained.  The producer, writer, director, all hoped, we must assume, that this woudl be the pilot of a series that would let them indulge in their personal fantasies at the audience expense.  In the end, even radical new film makers have to remember that hey are story tellers and should tell a story, not set up a franchise.  This is not so much a movie as the ""proposal"" you send to a studio for consideration.

6196544,4,B00HQF9TFO,"For the first 30 minutes or so the movie is barely watchable but the last 20 to 30 minutes rate 4 stars. The story is a good one, although for anybody who has read a few thousand scifi stories it's predictable, but whoever edited the film should go back to drawing storyboards. Good editing can make a lame movie great, but lousy editing can make a decent movie painful to watch. That was the problem, here. The acting wasn't great but if you can look past the editing, it was good. What look like awkward pauses was not bad acting but the need for tighter editing. Grumbling about the editing aside, if you've got nothing better to watch, take a chance on this one. Like I said, the last 20 minutes or so make up for most of it.",1422662400,,729,4.251798561151079

BUT! the PLOT IS AWESOME! It has a really cool concept for how time works, it actually DOES HAVE NICE GRAPHICS that are not even close to being bad, and if you like action/drama/sci-fi, I highly recommend you watch this. I put this a little higher than ""The Man From Earth"" overall, but equally in having a well thought out story.",1422489600,2,556,4.616161616161616

Like all time-travel stories you have to pay close attention but the payoff is absolutely wonderful!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, the ending was sweet.  Watch through to the credits!!  It's a great story, just give it a little time to get spun up!  (pun intended)",1422144000,2,477,4.314606741573034
6196552,4,B00HQF9TFO,"An interesting story. Has some of the usual time travel problems, but it tries to address them, which makes it much better than most. It's interested in exploring time travel as a concept, rather than just using it as a plot device to tell some different story. I particularly liked their concept of ""gravity."" On the negative side, there were aspects of the story that I never quite figured out, even after two viewings. And I thought that it was kind of silly to have the future agents wearing big I-95 badges.

Many reviewers have complained about the production values and the acting. Yes, this is a low budget movie. But a good story can be told without a big production. (The original Dr Who series for example). This has a pretty good look to it, with some effective CGI here and there to make it look bigger than it is. And yes, the acting is not what it could be, but I didn't find it distracting. The only times I noticed it was when they were trying to convey urgency or anger. The direction, camera work and editing seem quite good.

And watch the credits and cast listing at the end. It's the same three or four people and their families doing everything. Not just the big stuff, but everything. Even the costumes and the music. This is essentially a home movie. I have no idea how much they spent making it, but I think the fact that it looks like a low budget film is a testament to how well they've done their jobs.",1421971200,,1431,4.37593984962406

The acting from the lead actress was great, but the other acting fell flat, especially from the character that was playing her boss.

6196598,4,B00HQF9TFO,"I really liked this movie, as I am a fan of time travel movie in general and drive on I-95 regularly.  This time travel movie had a better plot than many others, a complex love story, a mystery, captivating timeline graphics, and scientific kernels about time and gravity interjected into the story to add realism.  They accomplished a lot with it for an indie film, and I thought did not wisely over-rely on a time machine or such technologies in the story vs. focusing on the heroine's abilities and then integrated the technology that did become important in an intriguing way as the mystery unfolded.  Lastly, I liked their references by multiple characters to ""tipping points,"" reminding the viewers that the fabric of time, our world, our lives is held in a delicate balance.  People with powers or technologies we don't have could be working to upset that balance unbeknownst to us and tip us into nothingness or another version of existence.  Unlike a few other posters, I have no complaints about the acting or production values.  If you find yourself caught up in the plot and focused on the intellectual aspects, which really do take some concentration to follow, you'll agree they spent their money on the right things.",1420329600,,1231,4.838095238095238

6196689,2,B00HQF9TFO,"Anyone who ranked this higher than a 2 needs to get out and see better movies.
The story has promise. Unfortunately the editing is choppy, directing is wanting, and the acting is exceedingly poor. For the most part, it sounds like everyone is doing a read-through - little characterization vocally and unfamiliarity of what is being said so that the lines have as much inflection as written words. The amateur ""A Christmas Carol"" within has more acting ability shown than the rest of the movie, and that is of the middle-school level.
The idea of jumping back 3 seconds is nice, and discovery of it is nicely portrayed. At least, it's written that way. Unfortunately, using jump cuts to show time steps later when there are no time steps lessens the visual effect of the ability to jump.
Music and sound editing are okay - music is very generic synth background, with little psycho-acoustic value.
Timeline graphics are nice, and convey very nicely the concepts of intercept. Other CG is choppy - like there is a frame rate issue (bouncy transitions, almost like animating every third frame).
I noticed that the same people did a lot of things. This could have been better if it wasn't so low budget and involved more talented people and time in pre-production.",1419379200,,1261,4.7889908256880735

6196694,4,B00HQF9TFO,"A really good movie.

I loved how it was initially unclear why things were happening in the fashion they did.  It is really neat to see this take on causality and time travel translated into the drama.

The only gripe I have with the movie is that there are some points in the movie where the dialog gets choppy, as though a writer just ran out of time polishing the script.  However this was more the exception than the norm.

It's a very intense and chaotic science fiction story with lots of twists and turns, and the whole is much greater than the parts.  Very nearly everything that happens in this movie touches something else.  I would imagine that being distracted during the movie would leave some gap that would be difficult to recover from.

My best advice to enjoy this movie...

Send the kids to bed.  Grab a beer or glass of wine, sit back and accept that time travel and shifting causality are very active in the storyline.  As the end of the movie approaches it stabilizes and the pieces come together.",1419292800,,1018,4.478260869565218

Nothing to complain about in the acting department either (except possibly that the acting by the teenage niece seemed a bit forced, but that is a pretty awkward age anyhow, so it could be realistically awkward).

This movie, 95ers: Time Runners (aka Echoes) professes and keeps to a single version of time travel. Once you suspend disbelief of the existence of time travel, this movie is perfect. It explains just enough to keep you engaged, and it leaves a mystery the nitty gritty details whose explanation would only serve to hinder the plot development and flow of the story.

""SPOILER""
It's based on TRUE science theory, of the particle's contained in gravity, another version of time travel than what Albert Einstein theorized, and he even said, it was more probable than his own idea.

The other people who have given reviews stating 1-to-3 stars, are the kind of people who would criticize a perfect world, claiming ""it's too slow and there is no excitement."" as they have been spoiled to the ""Million dollar movies"" with CGI, and big named producers like MGM, WB, TRI-STAR, LIONS GATE, and the like. (Probably ""Rob Zombie"" fans!)

I read a few of these reviews, and I now know, I can not trust these ""review's"" to determine any of these movies as worthy to watch.. Many many of the worst show's I have ever witnessed are rated as 4+ to 5 stars here on Amazon, and some really good ones are rated 3 and below. This brings me to the conclusion, that these people have ""No taste, or decency"" in there selection's of shows, as there ratings and reviews prove it. ""Character, story, acting, action,"" are some of there words, they complain about, but after watching what they say is a 4+ to a 5 star, I see they just want the ""Sex, Violence, strong language, and/or Gore"" (in any one or combination of aforementioned,) and I am sickened to realize, ""These people have NO idea what a good movie really is..

I feel sorry for non techies or non sci fi readers/fans as the flow of timelines can be difficult to follow.  The brilliant thing is this flick is the tying of the gravity question to the nuance of the characters.  Of course, ""gravity"" in this context refers to the relative temporal solidity of the character in question.  Sally's gravity was high because of the choices she made in her life and her ability to manipulate time to redress situations.  What was less clear is the ""95er"" moniker.  I understood its significance in the sense that it marked an epicenter for Sally's gravity, but they did a poor job of showing its connection to the dystopian future.

I'd like to see this story redone by a big producer with the same cast but a better director who can support an actor when (s)he clearly is struggling.  A good choice would be someone like Joss Whedon who could attract the money needed but who has the right attitude towards women so the story is not turned into an all male save-the-world binge.

If you want science fiction that has a founding in real science then here it is.

On to the aesthetics.  The movie itself was made on a shoe string budget that was obvious.  However, the majority of the work was well in excess of the money used to create the story.  The limited CG work makes the movie more visceral and enjoyable.  The voice over work can be a bit harsh and should have been toned down but still applies well to the overall narrative.  I enjoyed this movie for its film work which was ""okay.""  I enjoyed this movie for its narrative, which was ""good.""  I enjoyed this movie for its characters which were, ""very good.""  I enjoyed this movie because though none of the elements was better than, ""very good,"" when combined they created something that was  very very good.  It is nice to see a movie that allows its elements to mesh instead of overpower.

For anyone that likes pure sci-fi, this one's a good option.  For anyone who is actively studying temporal causality, this is a very very good movie to see.  For anyone who expects a wishy washy narrative that's super easy to follow, well sorry guys, you're bang out of luck on that.  This movie does require that you pay attention and listen.

We imagined how much better this would be if a more star studded cast, larger budget, and more visionary director were behind this storyline. The beginning of the film moved a little slow and there were parts that left you confused as to what was going on. We now know it was an attempt to achieve a build up where everything culminated to the climatic end. Unfortunately some of the scenes seem misplaced, or out of context with the storyline, and there was a shifting timeline where you couldn't see how it related to the main characters for almost the first half of the movie. It all started to pull together after this and the questions you had in the beginning soon became apparent as the film progressed.

I like movies that give me something to think about in terms of intellectual topics, you know, cutting edge science, psychology, sociology, movie making, so I am well pleased with 95ers: And further the lead actor Alesandra Durham did a fantastic job and so I liked watching this movie very much because of her, and the storyline and special effects for the story are great.",1414540800,3,701,4.4765625

Before I watched it I read 1 really positive and 1 really negative constructive review, so I felt I went into the viewing with an unbiased mindset. Yes, it is a low budget film. Yes, it could have done some things better. Yes, it could have had a more marketable title. Having said that, the cover art is freaking awesome, the acting was decent (several parts putting the ""hook"" in me like when the main character was frowning while reading the diary), the ""crazy crayon"" graphics were appealing, the soundtrack was SUPERB, the depth was pretty deep, and of the 'Starship-Troopers-or-Pacific-Rim-style-of-a-lower-budget-but-still-great' movie, it had several funny parts in it that surprised me when I LOL'd at them.

By that I mean the viewer is never told the what, why, and how of the whole thing. You are left to piece things together as the story moves along.

6197089,2,B00HQF9TFO,"This movie would have made an OK graphic novel aimed at ages 12-14. The biggest issue with the movie is that it was written, directed and at least partially produced by the same person. To pull that off one has to be an excellent writer. Apparently Thomas Gomez Durham is not.

Other reviews of this film criticize the acting but I disagree. It seemed to me the actors did the best they could given the script. A good director might have helped but when the director is also the writer then there is little chance that the director will be able to see the problems inherent in the screenplay.

The time travelling concepts have all been done before in other movies of higher quality. There are a lot of concepts mixed together at once and that has a novelty to it.

If you are about 13 years old you might enjoy the movie a good deal but more experienced viewers will find it difficult to achieve the necessary ""suspension of disbelief"".

Overall I can't recommend the movie. It might be interesting, however, to see what the writer could do if he partnered with a team that could point out the weaknesses in his screenplays and push him towards improvement.",1413676800,3,1158,4.526315789473684

I was about to turn this movie off about 30 or whatever minutes in.  It was atrocious.  Then i remembered i was watching a sci-fi, and up to that point, i had seen no such movie.  so i gave it a little more time.

Over time, the story pulled me in, just enough to watch the entire movie, but by god, the acting in this movie is atrocious.  Horrible.  This story and these actors existing in the same movie is a paradox in and of itself.

Conceptually, this is a 5 star movie.  This movie shows a lot of interesting takes on time travel, probably the best I've ever seen.  The writers/producers appear to have great aspirations, and are trying to create a Matrix like universe.

However, this is one of those movies that keeps you on your toes (at least for me it did).  I was trying to keep up with the story/concepts/editing so much that I ultimately lost contact with the characters.  And characters that you don't feel for or empathize with is a big no-no in my book.

Film budget is not that important to me, as long as the other qualities (ie. story/drama/characters) are fully fleshed out.  Well, the story part they've got down, at the expense of everything else.  As a result, I'll give the movie 3/5 stars.  My review/score of this movie may change, after I've re-watched it a bit; these are just my initial impressions.

With that being said, I am greatly impressed with what the writers/producers are trying to do here.  If you're interested, check out www. 95ers.com for more details.  It appears that this movie may be the tip of the iceberg.",1413072000,2,1169,4.611650485436893

And while I am not one who demands that answers be spoon fed to them, and I am comfortable with ambiguity in a film, a teeny bit more expository might have been useful, and what little there was could have been handled better  (there was too much of the ""as you and I both know, my dear brother bob, our sister, who's name is janet, is a blonde"" type dialogue).

I would love to have seen what they could have done with this film with a higher budget (particularly for a better cast).

While the acting (some wooden, some almost comically theatric) does periodically drag out out of the story, the story itself is compelling enough to bring you back in. I'm hoping that the film is successful enough financially to warrant a sequel. They have created an interesting new universe in which to create a multitude of stories. I look forward to seeing more.

Despite the budget, the effects, sometimes uneven, in other places shine and are even beautiful. Liked especially the visual representations of the timelines and some of the future landscapes and ""sets."" Here and there, the acting can be jarring, but the unknown cast is often good enough and at times, totally convincing. There is a bit of fun in the ""rewind"" scenes, which balances some of the more ponderous parts. I've seen much worse. Being a time travel story, it does jump back and forth and, perhaps just a little too much as coherence sometimes crumbles. It's becomes so much a puzzle to solve as a jumble to unravel.

6197230,5,B00HQF9TFO,"This was such a unique and interesting film!  I'm still trying to figure out what it is about it that had me say ""WOW"" when it was all over ....

If you've read some of the other reviews, you'll see mention of bad acting.  And it was ... but, as I've thought about this movie for several days since seeing it (another indication of how good it is ... ) I've wondered if the acting isn't part of the whole ""thing"" that is so unique in this movie, and one of the threads that is woven thru the story.  Throughout the show there are several scenes of folks rehearsing Dickens' Christmas Carol, and the acting in that play goes from horrible (at the beginning of the movie) to fantastic (at the end of the movie), and I wonder if the actual acting itself is one of the threads woven into this movie (along with time travel, a lost love) that serve to intersect and modify the theme as a whole.  Because the last few final scenes have tremendous acting.

And by the way ... don't stop watching when the credits first start rolling!!

The visual effects used to show time travel were superb, and helped make concrete a very theoretic idea.  And, from what little of the science of time travel I understand, this movie respected that science very well.

With all that as a backdrop, let me say that the movie captured my attention from the first few minutes and totally drew me into it for the entire length.  I connected with the characters and cared about them.  The little tidbits the movie revealed (after the fact) on how something happened were delightful (how did she get that password in 3 tries?)

It truly was a delight to find a movie that actually expected me to engage my brain while watching.  Give this a try ... I think you'll really like it!!",1412553600,3,1752,4.386996904024768

6197266,3,B00HQF9TFO,"This movie wasn't bad and it wasn't great, and it was definitely stuffed to the gills with concepts and metaphors, albeit you have to ride over the discordant continuity problems to enjoy the ending.

Horatio Biggs is is kind of pompous, but when he sees Sally singing with some Christmas carollers, he falls in love. They have a courtship and then ten minutes into the movie - out of the blue - Horatio is gone, and Sally is pregnant,.and her hair has gone from long blonde to short brown, and she's an FBI agent.  I had not a clue about any of that during the first ten minutes when Horatio was wooing her, and for most of the movie I had not a clue about what happened to Horatio, except that he had died, and later, that they hadn't recovered the body, except that Sally keeps seeing him around the house just before he disappears.

Intercut through with this are flashes from the future where a bald-headed guy and a guy in a leather jacket with a ""95"" decal are mostly yelling at each other in technobabble about probability and acquiring her and gravity and whatnot.  Outside of wherever they are, slow moving airships are shot down over an apocalyptic smoky landscape.

Sally, on the other hand, is gradually revealing the power she has ala Nick Cage in ""Next"" to reset nine-seconds, which comes in helpful at various times in the movie, particularly since there are some bad-guys who want to capture her for some reason.

Through it all there are constant references to Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,"" which I've never seen as a time travel story, but this movie shows, in a strange way, it is.

The movie gets good when the pieces come together and the bad guys show their hands by interfering with a decision Sally made years before.  As is typical with the genre, there are wheels within wheels.  If you can't identify the man in the leather jacket with the ""95"" decal, then turn in your ""I watch science fiction movies"" secret decoder ring.

The movie talks about paradoxes, but there really weren't any. The problem and the solution were quite straightforward.  The future war is never explained.  There is an indication for a sequel at the end.

The actress who plays Sally - Alesandra Durham - is lovely and a very competent actress.  Many of the other actors were good. The sound and editing could have been better.  The plot is way over-complicated, and, yet, ultimately enjoyable.

Nonetheless the acting never got any better all the way to the end. How the story remained so cogent with such horrible production values is the paradox. Like a story in a story.... Hey, we'll add one more - a story in a story in a story if you include the play on Dicken "" Christmas Carol which kept reappearing throughout.

Going into it without expectations reminded me of seeing Star Wars when it first came out. Yes, it's scifi, yes parts are a bit corny, but there's wit and some twists, too. Unlike SW, these characters aren't mythic but very human. Jerk of a husband, a crowd of friends rehearsing A Christmas Carol in true amateur fashion, a sassy teenage pool shark and a woman haunted by one past that can't be changed and another that perhaps can be.

Some of the acting was awful, but that's okay for this kind of movie, and the effects were amateurish, but that's okay too.  I have a lot of tolerance for such things, so they don't affect my scoring.  Rather, it was the way the movie unfolded and the plot developed that was disappointing.  There was no need for the disjointed, eclectic clips strung together the way they were.  There are great movies that actually use such an approach to good effect - everything seems disjointed but it all comes together as the movie unfolds.  But here, there was no value to such an approach - jumping from a minute of poor quality CGI alien attacks with laser-firing spaceships to a home scene where friends are rehearsing Dickens' A Christmas Carol is distracting and did not contribute to the interesting story,",1399420800,4,909,4.794871794871795

6197300,5,B00HQF9TFO,"Having helped fund this film via Kickstarter, I awaited, with breathless anticipation, for my DVD copy of 95ers: Timerunners to arrive and, the day I got it, I viewed it. It exceeded my expectations by a mile! I expected it to be a good movie, but the sheer quality of the writing, acting and SFX moved the movie into A-list territory.

Baffling at first, writer/director, Tom Durham, spins the plot from the middle out, expanding on the beginning and revealing the direction of the story a tantalizing bit at a time until the films satisfying conclusion. Yet, when the headache you get from sorting out all the time paradoxes fades, you realize the ending merely provides a launching point for another exciting adventure.

For a small-budget effort, I'm also impressed with the caliber of actors, director Durham assembled for this film, including his gorgeous wife, who shares the lead. She invests a lot of zest into her FBI character (even while pregnant!), without having to resort to swing kicks and MMA moves. Her character is strong and believable. The rest of the cast also work well together, bringing a high degree of professionalism to their parts, big or small.

Overall, the Special Effects are amazing! They look seamless and believable, even when delving into time travel, always a difficult thing to pull off. That they even exist in a movie of such a humble budget is a miracle in itself and a credit to Durham and his crew's sheer inventiveness and tenacity to get it right.

Writer/director/producer Tom Durham deserves a TON of kudos for making a shoe-string movie into a sci-fi, indie jewel. Ive always been a fan of indie movies and this effort moves him near the top of my list. With so many cookie cutter movies coming out of Hollywood, i'd sincerely love to see him get more funds directed his way to allow him to continue with this level of originality. I also like the wholesome plot and action in the movie, a nice change from the over-sexed content of many films today. The adage, ""sex sells"" may be true to some extent, but this film shows it's not necessary to a good story.

With 95ers: Timerunners under his belt, I think Tom Durham could knock the socks off many big budget films, given a quarter the budget. I look forward to seeing great things from him in the near future and my wife and I are proud to have supported this brilliant effort. If you're any sort of sci-fi, time travel and indie fan, get this movie! You won't be disappointed.",1397865600,12,2478,4.674311926605505
