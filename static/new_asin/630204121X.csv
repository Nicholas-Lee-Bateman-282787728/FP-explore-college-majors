420403,5,630204121X,"As other articulate(aussprechen) reviewers so graciously describe in fantastische means here Fassbinder really had it in the Old Days. Too bad he Burned Himself Out before the the last cigarette was snuffed or gallon of bourbon or swelling of his(anwachsend) puffing face receeded. As he lived his life taking extraordinary chances so did his creativity,his films, actually theatre with a lens,as The Bitter Tears here attests. One great shot, stilled, One Stage,Petra's old modernist studio, this forces concentration of this emotional feminist abbatoir, well Petra, who strikes one as a de Beauvoirian Feminist wanting simply the Man's world of privilege,power, market success and recognition. There is a wonderful subtexts here as well of Hegel's 'Master and Servant', from the 'Phenomenology of the Spirit', a work Hegel intended more for its pedagogical value,  Petra treats her servant, (who is a speechless role, another working class metaphor Marx would have loved) like schiessen, smutz und Dreck.""Another bourbon,(Petra shouts in hysteria) now"", "" keep typing, keep sketching, it is important. . .""""Change my plane ticket"" Yet she goes on, her life goes on with her obsessions for Karin,the hefty, ""bleckadicta""(damaged) Hanna Schygulla,who simply betrays her(Petra) all along the route here. Not Good Sisterhood a 'Die Walkure', were no better they betrayed Brunnhilde as well, but that's Wagner's feminism. Fassbinder would have had more to think about had Julia Kristeva or Luce Irigaray had developed their impressive theories on feminine sexuality contra Lacan at the early Seventies. Karin at times fabricates her Other world, Petra wanted to know ""Where were you last night, you didn't come home?"", ""I slept with a Black Man who had a Big Black Dicc"". Petra is shattered for she beleives this tall tale.

Virtuoso performances here, a depth of dialogic as Bahktin might say in that depth of focused theatre we really don't see again in Fassbinder, not even the mountainous Berlin Alexanderplatz, where the drama, the emotive dimensions get diluted with its oceanic lengths. Again Rainer taking chances,simply getting more from surfaces than theatrical depth, what happened to Brecht and Freud combined, and paying the price.  Adorno said someplace, art must pay a price for itself, for its own integrity, so it can enter the real world.
Margit Carstensen as Petra sort of reinvents herself as the work progresses, changing wigs,Cleopatra-like dress into her own line of fashion I presume.  The tune ""Smoke gets in your eyes"" was a great choice here in the opening moments, transformative sickly nostalgia, Petra remembering her own rotten life. She seems to hate everything and everyone including at the conclusion here her mother, girlfriends all wishing her Happy Birthday! also her oefish daughter clad in bland school uniform. But no one seems to understand Petra(except her servant,which proves Hegel Marx) all she wants is Karin, the intimacy of this love. Yes that's reasonable, and the world didn't give in to it, at least not in the early Seventies. Petra mother was shocked. Perhaps in retrospect we find Petra's obsessions quite commonplace,but back then(and I assume here the film is partial autobiographical for Fassbinder,in the number of boyfriends that had betrayed him.)
We tend to listen to everyone in this work,Don't know if Rainer knew of the sparce dramatic encrustations of Sam Beckett) everyone is heard, no matter how obsessed mundane,how ill-focused,and boring one's life, and its daily minutae(Mine u sha)we still listen. Rainer Werner compells us to. He was a virtuoso.",1029974400,10,3614,5.34622144112478

To concentrate on the remarkable performances and tortuous dialogue would be to get only half the film.  In this closing down (rather than opening up) of an original play, it is the decor and Fassbinder's framing that counts, adding layer upon layer of irony, meaning, mockery, imprisonment and poignant emotion onto the ghastly claustrophobic farce.  It's hard to remain straight-faced at such anguish with eloquent mannequins lying about, and a giant wall mural-painting dictating every 'human' pose.",986947200,7,673,5.330188679245283

420441,4,630204121X,"""The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant"" (1972) - was the first Fassbinder's film I saw many years ago in Moscow and it had started my fascination and interest in the work of the enormously talented man who was a writer/director/producer/editor/actor for almost all his movies. ""The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant"" is a screen adaptation of the earlier Fassbinder's play and it never leaves the apartment of Petra Von Kant, an arrogant, sarcastic, and successful fashion designer who constantly mistreats and humiliates her always silent and obedient assistant Marianne (Irm Hermann, with whom Fassbinder made 24 movies). As a background for Petra's apartment, Fassbinder uses the blowup of Poussin's painting ""Midas and Bacchus."" The use of the mural is ironic on more than one level. Nude Bacchus stands in the center of the mural and is the only male presence in a film populated entirely with women. Petra, not unlike legendary Midas wished for herself a golden girl, young and beautiful Karin with golden hair (Hanna Schygulla, another Fassbinder's muse with whom he made over 20 films). As with Midas from legend, it turned to be a huge mistake for Petra who learned herself what abuse, indifference, and humiliation meant. With just a few characters locked in the claustrophobic and suffocating atmosphere of the apartment, the film is never slow or boring thanks to the young director/writer story-telling ability and to magic camera work by Michael Ballhaus (""Goodfellas"", ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", and ""After Hours"" among others). It is hard to believe that such a gorgeous looking movie was shot for ten days only. I've read that Fassbinder was able to make so many movies in such a short period of time because they were cheaply produced - no special effects, no big action scenes, no exotic locations. This is true but his movies are most certainly not cheap - highly intelligent, thought provoking, always excellently acted and beautiful or perhaps I've been lucky and have not seen the ones that don't fit the description.

420442,4,630204121X,"Fassbinder's impressive psychoanalytical exploration of oppression both sexual and emotional between the genders (told entirely with dialogue) and the oppression between the same genders is a complex affair. To counter the depth and range of emotions and conflicting feelings, Fassbinder uses a very direct and simplistic filmic approach. The film is shot almost entirely in one room and he uses a large number of medium static shots, sometimes lasting as long as five minutes without a cut - this illustrates both Fassbinder's economic working style and acts as a visual juxtaposition to the complexities on screen. The essential dilemma the characters wrestle with, is who wields the power in a relationship. Fassbinder takes the position that the one who loves and shows it, is the weaker. Wonderfully 70's with colourful costumes and an above average mise-en-scene for Fassbinder, this is an effective exploration of the moral maze and conflict with any relationship, be it between men and women or the same sex.",1158796800,3,1016,5.277777777777778
420443,5,630204121X,"Perhaps Fassbinder's most revolutionary film, Petra von Kant manages to combine the stunning cinematography of Michael Ballhaus with very deliberate symbolism and a brilliant script of viscious circles to create an art form at once prosaic and highly intellectual at the same time. Fassbinder brings the theatre back into film (or maybe the other way round) and, as in 'Martha', we feel so strongly connected with the main character as to feel all the pain and agony.  This movie is one truly powerful cinematic experience. One gets a sense of the often chaotic and emotional life that Fassbinder himself must have had.",1114560000,4,619,5.068627450980392
420444,5,630204121X,"The film is based in the theatrical work of the same name of Rainer Werner Fassbinder . the only stage of the action is the workshop dwelling of the protagonist , the fashion designer Petra von Kant a refined and eccentric woman divorced twice who lives with her secretary-slave Marlene.

That happiness period will break when Karim decides to reconciliate with her husband . Petra , obviously is very distured and she rebuilds many aspects of her past behavior , but when she proposes Marlene a participation in the business , Marlene leaves home .

This was one the creative peaks in the career of this indefatigable creator of human portraits . Somehow Petra is a mirror image of him in those times . But far beyond the anecdotic aspect ,the film is a merciless story about the loneliness and hopeless gaze of the female world . Personally I do not know about another film maker in the story of the cinema who deals with these themes with such fineness and deepness . He never will take a previous attitude ; he drowns in these troubled waters and suffers with them their triumphs and calamities . He is the legitimate son of Douglas Sirk with a major scope , indeed .

Since his early death in 1982 , when he just was in his thirties (36) , the creative world of the german cinema still  remains inciomplete . You may name Percy Aldon , Herzog , Wenders , Kluge and Hauff but something  lost in the environment , due the prodigious and outstanding mind  of Fassbinder is absent .",1096675200,4,1666,4.558528428093646
420445,5,630204121X,"Considerable journalism and scholarship has been devoted to Fassbinder's admiration for works of Danish-born film director Douglas Sirk. However Fassbinder did, in fact, loosely borrow from many melodramatic texts, Mildred Pierce for The Marriage of Maria Braun, Sunset Blvd. for Veronica Voss, both in the BRD Trilogy, and in the case of The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, from Joseph's Mankiewicz's All About Eve.
In the audio commentary, popular arts critic Jane Shattuc makes reference to Fassbinder's theatrical renderings in the film, Petra's couture costumes, tightly framed background shots of the Poussin painting in Petra's apartment, and use of lighting, all of which provide the viewers with every bit of intimacy as a performance on stage.
Obviously his own background and training in theater was one source of inspiration for the film. But certainly another was his fascination with Hollywood melodrama, and specifically in this instance, Joseph Mankiewicz's characteriztion of Broadway legend Margo Channing and her idol Eve Harrington in All About Eve.
While same class consciousness dyanamics are evident in both films, so are elements of lesbianism and bi-sexuality. Only in the case of Fassbinder the class differences between Petra, her appentice, and the Hanna Schgulla character become stark and more exaggerated. As for sexual oreintation, what's implied in All About Eve is more evident in Petra von Kant and worthy of a enough consideration to do a doctorial dissertation on the subject.
i love this film because it provides the most vivid and detailed characterizations of female intentions, wants, and desires of any other film in the Fassbinder canon, including the female characters in the BRD Trilogy or Berlin Alexanderplatz.",1077321600,8,1757,5.43956043956044

420447,3,630204121X,"*****SOME SPOILERS******

My rating is actually 2.5 stars. I was intrigued by the synopsis of this film and then the overall production design(the single divded loft space, the central positioning of the big bed, the vibrant wall painting in almost all the shots, and of course the costuming) really drew me in. Given that the film only has five or six scenes, each scene is 20 to 25 minutes long. The majority of each scene consists Petra Von Kant rambling on about her ethics, philosophies, and tragedies. She is completely self-obsessed. While there is sympathy for her life's pain and admiration for her sense of independence, her treatment of everyone around her is either callous(Marlene), patronizing(Sidonie and her daughter), predatory(Karin), or wheedling(Karin and her mother).

  Even her love for Karin, however doomed, is poisoned by her inability to see anything outside of herself. Before their affair begins, Karin tells Petra exactly who she is in terms of her goals, discipline, desires, and damaged world view. Yet Petra refuses to acknowledge the real Karin and is shocked to find herself used and cast aside by Karin.

  Throughout the film, Marlene, Petra's assistant, is a silent witness to Petra's dramatic highs and lows. She toils like a machine. Maintaining a patient grace, Marlene withstands Petra's demanding viciousness and suffers the presence of the callow  Karin.  Every once in a while, Marlene's expression reveals her abject love for Petra. Marlene's devotion to Petra is not tragic unto itself; Marlene is happy in her submissive role. It is Petra's willful ignorance of Marlene's sacrifice that is the issue.

  While Petra's dissolution into a lovelorn harpy is strangely humorous, her utterly destructive will toward all of her other relationships is the ultimate realization of her selfishness. This quality, not Petra's lesbian desire, is the deviant ""other"" of the film.",1063238400,,1915,5.2631578947368425
420448,5,630204121X,"I'll admit that watching any foreign film is enhanced by knowing the spoken language, in this case, German.  The film depicts what is essentially a one-room, two-scene play, in which fashion designer Petra von Kant interacts with first with her ""help"" (the speechless Marlene), an old friend (Sidonie), and the young and beautiful Karin (Scene 1).  Then, abandoned by Karin, and having already completely rejected men for their weaknesses and bestiality, Petra is left to confront her mother, daughter, and finally her abandonment by Marlene (Scene 2).
This film depicts the fragility of the interdependece of each on the other, even in a world in which men are villified (Petra) or merely used (Sidonie and Karin).  The silent Marlene appears to emerge as the victor, as she packs one bag, thoughfully dropping a pistol in it among her other limited posessions, since it is she who apparently does most of Petra's designs (and voluminous writing on a non-electric typewriter).
The meaning of the cats on the stairway to Petra's bedroom/living-room/workroom during the initial credits remains a mystery to this viewer.  I suspect each individual viewer will find some allegory to his or her own compromises in life throughout the film...",1048032000,2,1237,5.17
420449,5,630204121X,"The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972), one of Fassbinder's masterpieces, explores the tortured connections between desire and power. Not only is the DVD of exceptional quality, it includes both of Fassbinder's fascinating short films (""The City Tramp"" and ""The Little Chaos"") plus a revealing documentary.
Although Bitter Tears remains one of Fassbinder's most controversial films - in part for its severely limited depiction of women's lives - it is also one of his most powerful. Fortunately, the range of lesbian-themed films in the past thirty years has presented women's experiences in considerably more diversity and fullness, so perhaps now we can better evaluate the film's considerable merits.
Fassbinder's casts are always uniformly strong, but this one is extraordinary, especially Margit Carstensen in the title role (she won several awards), Hanna Schygulla (with whom Fassbinder made 20 pictures) as her new lover Karin Thimm, and Irm Herrman as Petra's mysterious assistant Marlene who, without uttering one word, at times dominates with her sheer presence.
The film is astonishing for its interweaving of raw emotion with stunning and meticulous design. Fassbinder and director of photography Michael Ballhaus (who shot about half of the director's films, and now does all of Scorsese's pictures) wrest every bit of visual interest from the single claustrophobic set (we never leave this one apartment). The endlessly inventive deep focus compositions provide a series of emotionally penetrating, and technically virtuosic, comments on the action - ironic, allusive, symbolic, and visually gorgeous. The only picture which approaches this level of achievement - in making limited physical space utterly compelling as cinema - is Cocteau's Les Parents Terribles (1948), but he had all of two sets!
Fassbinder also makes acerbic use of every carefully placed object in the lavish apartment. Most notable is a gigantic blowup of Poussin's painting ""Midas and Bacchus,"" which reminds us that Petra - like Midas, whose life was blasted by the ""golden touch"" - should be careful what she wishes for. The nude Bacchus stands in the center of the mural - and not infrequently Fassbinder's compositions - with the body of, well, a Greek god, a larger-than-life male in a film peopled entirely with women. Some critics argue that this overbearing backdrop represents the patriarchal system which underlies, and perhaps even dooms, the relationship of Petra and Karin. Fassbinder includes many other witty, even playful, elements throughout the film, both to give it greater resonance, and to keep it from descending into bathos. For instance, dramatic form has rarely been so drolly encapsulated as when Petra changes into a new wig - ""symbolically"" indicating her emotional state - in each of the film's five scenes (each unfolds in continuous time).
Although it would be unfair to reveal the ending, a tentatively optimistic reading may be possible: For one character it revolves around a newfound self-respect, for another because she has, for the first time, genuinely reached out to someone else. The film is so rich, on so many levels, that you may find yourself seeing it differently on each viewing. Few works so creatively, and powerfully, manage to subvert our desire for cathartic drama while simultaneously fulfilling it.
FASSBINDER'S SHORT FILMS ARE ALSO INCLUDED on this DVD. Both were made in 1966, when he was 19. ""The City Tramp,"" about a homeless man who finds a gun, is a work of extraordinary, stark visual design and intriguing commentative sound (street noise juxtaposed with classical music juxtaposed with silence). It boasts excellent performances, with Fassbinder raising it far above the level of a ""vanity piece"" for financial backer cum star Christoph Roser. It also introduces several of the filmmaker's recurring themes, including alienation, the role of the outsider, exploitation, and violence, while its sporadic playfulness highlights another vital, and fun, aspect of his work. ""The Little Chaos"" is about three friends who use their knowledge of American crime movies (and Godard's 1964 film Band of Outsiders) to rob a woman. Although not as visually striking or emotionally rich as ""City Tramp,"" it features first-rate performances and has a refreshing exuberance.

  ""Love is colder than death""  (Other Fassbinder's early films from 1969), could be one of the epigraph of this movie. That show us that doesn't matter what sexual orientation are you directed to, love wasn't and easy task to live in.
  Petra van Kant (Margit Castersen)  is a Diva in fashion designer, a selfish narcissistic personality.  She has a secretary and co-designer, Marlene (Irm Hermenn) that was also his lover, now is more a sado - masoquistic relationship, in the psychological arena. A beautiful girl that what to be a model was introduced by a friend. Karin a 23 years old (Hanna Shygulla), that did not know how to do really in life but to live in a parasitic way, using what mother nature gave to her.
  Interestingly Marlene did not speak during the movie. She accepts her peripheral situation because she did need to decided about nothing. Except when Petra changed the way of dealing with her, after Karin dumped her. Then Marlene could not stand that and runaway from Petra's home. The desire and power, was a central issue in the film, and a gigantic painting in the wall address that: ""Midas and Bacchus"". Petra was born with a kind of gift for fashion design, but that is not enough for to be happy, Midas is asking for advice to a nude Baccus. So to be rich and famous it is not a receipt for happiness, a pleasure godess may have some other approach,  as we will learn watching this drama.
  This movie with his theatrical design and shooting, is a careful study about three female personalities, so Reinner displayed what he knew better about everything: The women soul.",1212969600,,1641,4.6366782006920415
7820637,4,630204121X,"It is always interesting watching a film where virtually every character (with the exception of Petra's daughter, an innocent victim in all this) is more or less dislikeable.  More than one person has found this film inaccessible due to the fact that nearly everyone has mixed motives & hidden agenda.

This also makes it impossible to take satisfaction in Petra's personal disintegration, since Karin is equally manipulative & self-serving.  Petra's supreme arrogance makes it impossible for her to consider the notion that others might be able to exploit her just as she exploits others...while the viewer may see her comeuppance in the distance, it is a true shock to Petra when she is discarded.  Ironically, it is when she has gotten what she deserves that she becomes the most sympathetic to the viewer.

Nobody should go into this movie expecting a lot of action or great cinematography...the claustrophobic nature of the film very much reflects the stage origins of this screenplay.  Lots of dialogue, no action, a lot of not-very-nice characters...this movie will not be for everybody, definitely.
