8625037,5,B00GN646JQ,"This is one of those films I can't believe isn't a classic.  It's a great story, great acting, great photography and a blast in 3D.  If you're a 3D buff this is one of the nicest 3D movies out there.  If you're no a 3D person, get the blu ray.  A wonderfully underrated fantasy movie full of blood and guts.",1489363200,2,307,4.066666666666666
