2181277,5,B0006B46K8,"The reputation AMAZING GRACE has gotten over the years is very well founded. A documentary this long on this subject matter seems destined to be boring. But AMAZING GRACE is as captivating as any book ever written on the topic of reformed theology. Check it out! You will become so well equipped to compassionately dialogue with any Arminian, and to lead your whole congregation in doing the same. The sovereignty of almighty God is wonderfully extolled by this documentary.",1144627200,10,474,5.012658227848101
2181278,5,B0006B46K8,"I've been a Christian for close to 20 years...all of which time I was Arminian.  I shunned the concept of Calvinism because it seemed altogether unjust & perposterous.  The Bible is full of countless referrals to 'God's Elect'...this was supposedly God talking about people whom he saw down into the future as accepting His offer of salvation.  This documentary  exposes  this nonsensical myth in the plainest most logical terms possible.  The scriptural support for the doctrines of grace are utterly irrefutable & to watch this presentation one cannot help but feel foolish for believing Arminianism & the shaky, weak foundation that 'Free Will' is based on. I am reading Luther's 'Bondage of the Will', a marvellous additon to the Amazing Grace presentation..as well as books by Jonathon Edwards, BB Warfield & Charles Spurgeon on the subject.  What most struck me about this presentation was how crystal clear the bible became after realizing Calvin didn't invent anything ..he just penned in his own words...what was already in the bible...it was not an idea he just came up with to refute the Arminians...  Augustine the great theologian believed in election long before Calvin was ever born...& it's evident to me now ..that Paul the Apostle most definitely knew his salvation was God's choice...and nothing of his own self.  If you plan to buy this...& you're Arminian...as I was...watch it with an open heart & mind...& set aside the natural reaction of ""that isn't fair""...without setting that mindset aside..one cannot embrace the Just & Merciful God of the Bible.",1139875200,80,1575,5.12109375
2181279,5,B0006B46K8,"A friend/co-inductive bible study teacher shared his copy of this DVD.  All I can say is WOW.  This video goes over `church history' on various heresies that have been introduced into the church over time and how the church has dealt with them.  The examples used in their explanations will help me as I facilitate adult inductive bible studies.  While this DVD obviously gives the history of Calvinism, the value of this DVD is how various people in the past viewed various truths of scripture and the ramifications of misinterpreting / taking out of context what the bible says.  This DVD will be in our family library shortly.",1133568000,15,629,4.787037037037037
2181280,5,B0006B46K8,"This is best documentary I have seen so far, and also the most entertaining. On the day that I've received it, I watch through the entire documentary non stop for ~4 hours+. The presentation of the biblical Christian and Calvinist doctrines of grace unfolds like a detective story, as Eric Holmberg takes the audience on a journey first though the history of the entire monergism/ synergism controversy in the church and how the biblical teaching of salvation is totally antithetical to what passes as most of modern day evangelicalism. In the second part of the documentary, the viewer is taken through Scripture to illuminate God's Word as pertaining to the subject, showing the errors therein the heresy of Arminianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and Pelagianism, ending off with a demonstration of the poisonous fruit of this heresy as worked out in the lives of its adherents and in modern day history. The third part of the show then goes on to show the implications on evangelism and give us guidelines according to Scripture on how to do it.

I would highly recommand this DVD set to all who want to know more about God and about the entire Calvinist/Arminian controversy. In fact, I strongly encourage all Christians everywhere to get it, as I believe that only when God is given the full glory for Man's salvation and only when God is enthroned in salvation and evangelism will God work to bring about awakening and revival, for God 'will not share his glory with another' (Is. 48:11). The marketing techniques of the purpose driven and seeker sensitive churches are just symptoms of the underlying pride of Man thinking he can help God to win souls. Until and unless we repent and realize that God is the only Saviour and we are to follow His ways in evangelism, we will continue to reap false conversions and destroy the church from within.",1109289600,44,1843,4.832278481012659

I have purchased a copy for myself, as well as my father in law (who is a Baptist minister.)  This video is never boring and is chalked full of great commentary, vignettes, and interviews (not to mention the music is a great blessing.  I find myself humming Amazing Grace throughout the day!)

2181282,5,B0006B46K8,"What a refreshing and clear definition of Reformed theology.  Never have I seen the absolutely clear and precise presentation of Calvinism, except in book format.  If you really want to understand the biblical definition of God (theology), man (anthropology), sin, redemption, election, foreknowledge and quite simply Calvinism, or as C. H. Spurgeon put it ""the gospel"", then you will want to get this DVD.  It was great for my children who are all under 9.  They watched with anticipation as Eric Holmberg narrarates through the almost 5 hours of presentation.  You get church history concerning the controversy, from Augustine and Pelagius through the Luther/Erasmus debate.  I challenge those who are clearly Arminian and those who are Semi- Pelagian, as well as those in much of the SBC who are a mixture of both (Psuedo-Arminians) to examine the video.  It will be worth your while.  May God grant grace to the viewers of this film that their eyes may be opened to His glory in all its fullness.  Amen.",1099785600,39,1007,4.946428571428571

2181303,2,B0006B46K8,"Pros:
The presentation with its music and graphics is high quality.

Cons:
As it has been pointed out by others, the title of this video is a misnomer and somewhat disingenuous. It would more accurately be called: The Polemic Against Arminianism, or The Apologetic for Calvinism. I would say this video is merely an exercise in ""preaching to the choir."" It is amazingly one sided and I doubt it will do much more than make Calvinists feel good about being Calvinists.

I suspect that most non-Calvinists who watch this are going to be irritated and want to give their side in their own words and arguments. While watching, I constantly wanted to cry out, ""I DO NOT believe that, nor do I argue that way."" You might find someone who argues in those ways, but I think for most of us, it's just beating up a ""strawman."" And they sometimes commit the ""bifurcation fallacy"" (false dilemma) and say if you are an Arminian, then you either have to believe this or this, when there are in fact other possibilities.

I find it interesting that they keep referring to councils and the decisions made in them. Should a Christian's authority be the Word of God or human traditions, church laws, decrees of councils, and creeds which are constantly being changed and revised because of their imperfections?

Also, they use a lot of ""appeal to authority"": You see, great and godly men are in favor of it so it must be right. There is a great flaw in this thinking. According to the Bible, after our lives are over, we will not be judged by what other people have said, no matter how godly or smart we may think they are, but by the words of Jesus (John 12:48). And they seem to miss the fact that there are those of us who are not Calvinists who don't follow Palagianism or Arminianism (and certainly don't like being categorized by the name of a man).  Many of us don't care what Palagius or Arminius taught, but rather, we simply care about the Bible's teachings.

Another problem is they come across as extremely arrogant which I find very off-putting. And every now and then they use loaded words, question-begging epithet, and even snark (like Spurgeon's ""Armenian prayer"" and the book sale in the graveyard). This kind of stuff just makes them look like bullies and jerks.

They also like to use ""slippery slope"" arguments. They contend that Arminians are on a slippery slope to either Roman Catholicism or to liberalism. Oh, really? I felt like every time someone in the video said ""Arminianism"" they wanted to turn their head and spit.

And continuing to repeat that Calvinism has not been defeated and that Calvinism cannot be defeated certainly doesn't make it so; it just sounds like bluff and bluster. Also, when arguing against a passage used by non-Calvinists, they will often throw out a strong statement like, ""In fact, this is a powerful verse FOR Calvinism,"" but they are far from demonstrating that fact. It's like they think if the audience is told enough that Calvinism is true, that they will simply start to believe it.

There is also quite a bit of ""elephant hurling"" where they quickly throw out a bunch of scriptures or scripture references and assume their point has been proven (without actually examining them). But, throwing out a bunch of proof-texts isn't helpful--passages need to be carefully examined in their contexts. And when one does that examination, they can easily see how these passages can be interpreted in different ways. The people in the video often act as if their interpretation is the only one out there.

There are also some contradictory arguments. For example, at one point, they make a big deal about all-inclusive words and how ""all"" doesn't always mean ""all."" But, then, a bit later, they make the opposite argument from the word ""never"" in John 10 (""How long is never?"").

There were some other contradictory statements like their complaints against the depravity of our culture and saying: ""The only antidote to the sickness of our present age--the gospel of the kingdom of God."" But, I thought they taught that people can't accept the gospel without God forcing them to (Total Depravity/Irresistible Grace). And so, who cares if Arminianism causes liberalism (as they claim)? The only One who can do anything about it is God, since we are all ""totally depraved."" Don't blame Arminianism, blame God (or at least Adam). That statement makes a lot more sense if Calvinism is NOT true.

They even go so far as to say we can thank Calvinism for American liberty. And they say things like, ""Calvinism is probably the MOST influential theological strain in ALL of constitutional history."" Oh, don't be so modest (yeah, that's sarcasm).  Im sure they also created the internet.

One thing that I find interesting (the ""elephant in the room"") is if Calvinism is true, why make this video? If you really believe it's true, why argue about it--it doesn't make any difference what we believe and teach or what we want to do--it won't change my or anyone else's eternal destiny. There wouldn't be any point in discussing it, because our teaching on the subject will not change the salvation or damnation of one soul. Amazing Grace? Only for those lucky enough to be one of the ""elect."" Why waste my time with this DVD?

Here is a question I have (excuse the tongue-in-cheek): If I believe ""wrong"" on this, isn't that just proof that I'm NOT one of the elect (since it's a slippery slope into Roman Catholicism or liberalism)? Well, thank you so much for that confirmation! Now, I can sleep easy knowing for sure that I'm not one of the elect (no need to wonder). I can now just live any way I want (oh, goodie). I guess I'll quit praying and reading the Scriptures and quit trying to conform my life into the likeness of Christ; I wasn't lucky enough for God to love me. Oh, well, it didn't have anything to do with me anyway.

Conclusion:
I was hoping for a documentary on the ""history and theology of Calvinism,"" but what I got was a browbeating with a bunch of weak arguments.

After watching this, I'm reminded of Proverbs 18:17: ""The first to present his case seems right, till another comes forward and questions him.""",1359590400,3,6157,4.712558139534884

2181305,2,B0006B46K8,The speed in which the item came was very good.  The content of the DVD was very good.  But the quality of the recording was poor in some places to the point where we could not watch it.,1325548800,,186,3.8684210526315788

And, yes, I can imagine that for those who are or label themselves as believers of 'Arminianism' this would seem to be slanted against their beliefs.  But then, isn't that the stated purpose.  I think that to best layout what 'Calvinists' believe, you have to discuss the original controversy that caused the split into these two groups.

I guess I had never really thought this issue through that clearly, being someone who does not like controversy or divisions at all.  I preferred to have a neutral stand.  This discussion brought home more clearly to me the basics of the what was at issue and helped me to clarify my belief.  Having an history of the controversy also helped me to have a greater understanding of how the church has dealt with controversies throughout history.  For example, it made more clear to me the purpose for the different Church councils and the resultant creeds.

I highly recommend this!!!",1316131200,,1110,4.739583333333333
2181307,4,B0006B46K8,"Simply put, the content on this lengthy DVD is well worth watching and absorbing! More than just an overview of TULIP, it gives the background and history of the ""Sovereignty vs Free Will"" debate - a necessary component in understanding why this discussion is so important in our day and age. I've long considered myself a ""4-pointer"", and in the past few years as my Bible study has increased, I'm hard-pressed to see the Bible support anything less than all 5 points of the Doctrines of Grace. This DVD effectively lays out the questions and answers them with Scripture, tracing their import across the history of the Bible (both OT and NT). People who think Calvinists are just mind-numbed robots or whacked out fundies probably need to sit down and examine the evidence. This DVD is an excellent resource to this end.

In reflecting on this video, some sobering issues float to the forefront of my mind:
- What essential doctrines have I let slide to subtle ""harmless"" variations?
- What will be the impact of my neglecting the finer points of doctrine 20 years down the line? 50? 500?
- Is this on the list of what Paul kept referring to as 'doctrine' when he adamantly insisted that Timothy and Titus adhere to pure doctrine?

The more I study church history, the more I'm amazed that many of the questions we struggle with in the 21st century have already been dealt with in the past. Truer words were never spoken: the only thing we learn from history is that we fail to learn from history and are doomed to repeat it.

I'm still looking for a well-studied, Biblically grounded Arminian, since I have quite a few questions to pose. (Most of the Arminians that field my questions (including seminary presidents, mind you) just punt by saying ""Well - that's a mystery we'll never know. Is 55 says His ways are higher than ours, so we'll just have to accept that the Bible *appears* to have a contradiction there."" *sigh* The Doctrines of Grace, however, answers those questions superbly.)

Buy it.
Borrow it.
Study it.

I give the DVD 4 stars on account of the occasionally-distracting video production: harsh lighting, some sloppy video editing, and lack of Closed Captioning. When the audio is important, I always like CC running. And besides, my parents are deaf, so the fact that this DVD lacks CC means this Calvanistic DVD has .. umm.. shall we say ""Limited Audience"" ;)",1311379200,4,2382,4.716346153846154

2181309,5,B0006B46K8,"I never really understood what it meant to be ""Armenian"" although I'd heard the term used several times in Sunday School and among Christian circles.  First let me say my husband and I came across this DVD set while considering attendance at Dallas Theological Seminary.  We were involved in home bible study and wanted to further our study in scripture.  I expected it to be a long, dry series of sermons, but instead, I was riveted !!  It was abundantly fruitful with historical information that helped me understand the environment the Church was established in and what effected and still effects the body of Christ, His Church.  More importantly, it helped in relieving me of the burden that my salvation in Christ is based on my works or earning my salvation.  My salvation is based on the work of Christ on the Cross, his resurrection from the dead and His choosing me to become His and giving me His Holy Spirit as a guarantee of my eternal life with Him.  To Christ be the glory forever !!

After watching these DVDs, I think you will be quite blessed and increase in confidence in your faith in Christ and your personal walk with Him.  May you be set free from the burden of thinking you have to earn your salvation.  May you be set free by believing that Christ paid the price for your sins and there's nothing you can do to earn your salvation.  All He asks is that you accept His sacrifice on the cross as the payment for your sins, a payment that you can never pay (Romans 10:9).  May you come to repentence and saving faith in Christ and receive His Holy Spirit to enable you to work for His Kingdom, and make it your aim to keep His commands, not to try to earn your salvation, but to please Him and give Him Glory (John 1:12) because you love Him (Deuteronomy 10:12, Matthew 22:36-40, Luke 10:27-28).",1297296000,5,1817,4.472727272727273

2181314,1,B0006B46K8,"Contrary to the title of the video, this is not so much a ""history and theology of Calvinism"" as it is a polemic against Arminianism.  The history that the video does present is incomplete and at best slanted--at worst revisionist.  Most of it regards the usual arguments in the Calvinism/Arminianism debate:  Augustine & Pelagius, the Remonstrants & the Synod of Dort, etc., with little or no discussion of Reformed theologians such as Ulrich Zwingli, Theodore Beza, George Whitfield and Charles Spurgeon (other than a few anti-Arminian quotes); nor other historical topics such as Calvinism's development and rise to orthodoxy in Geneva, the struggles (and oppressions) as Calvinism spread through Europe, the Puritans, and Calvinism's growth in America.  The video also makes several dubious historical claims such as ""...most all of the historic orthodox church has been [Augustinian]..."", ""the greatest world mission enterprises have all been initiated in the past by men who believe ... the Reformed faith"", and ""...[the United States'] greatest revivals...were produced...by people who were committed to the doctrines of [Reformed] faith.""  It credits Calvinism as the source of American-style republicanism and not too subtly implies that Arminianism is to blame for the evils of modern society (two more debatable claims).

The questionable treatment of history has the effect of also casting doubt on the theological arguments the video presents.  The video describes Arminianism from a purely Calvinistic viewpoint with seemingly minimal effort to fairly represent Arminian beliefs.  The description is one that I suspect Arminians themselves would not profess.  The video is decidedly anti-Arminian, making statements such as ""... the Arminian gospel is no gospel at all"" and calling Arminianism a ""...perversion of Biblical teaching by the fallen mind of man.""  Many of its descriptions and caricatures of Arminian theology are juvenile and pejorative (such as the skit of a book sale at a graveyard).  In the end, the video comes across as an insincere (or at least unsuccessful) attempt to fairly present the Calvinism/Arminianism debate and Calvinist theology.",1278547200,9,2176,5.524096385542169
2181315,1,B0006B46K8,"Written by a brother and friend in the Lord, William Leary:

As the title suggests, Amazing Grace is a lengthy exposition and defense of the theology commonly known as Calvinism. This neatly packaged two disk DVD set is replete with quotes and commentary from history's most well known Reformed theologians, as well as interviews with today's leading Calvinistic teachers. A few of those included are Dr. R.C. Sproul, Dr. D. James Kennedy, Dr. Stephen Mansfield, and Dr. George Grant. They, along with the narrator, attempt to answer questions that many Christians struggle with regarding the sovereignty of God, predestination, free will, and other doctrines related to deterministic theology. While many churches walk the line between Calvinism and Arminianism, this video seeks to persuade the audience to adopt all five points of the famous acronym, ""TULIP"" (T = Total Depravity, U = Unconditional Election, L = Limited Atonement, I = Irresistible Grace, P = Perseverance of the Saints).

The discerning viewer, however, must look beyond the superficial elements of this presentation (such as the hi-tech audio and video production, professional editing, and the parade of intellectual sounding scholars), and honestly examine the evidence. And a good place to start is by asking the right questions. For instance, is the information in this documentary accurate? Secondly, is the information provided complete? In other words, does the video omit significant facts and events from history that may otherwise change how the audience perceives the outcome? Finding the answers to these questions will undoubtedly require time and additional research, but diligence has its rewards. Knowing the facts will help you to either accept the information as true or reject it as false.

And so the reader knows where the reviewer stands from the outset, I believe Calvinism to be a false, man-made religious system that should be avoided. Augustine was its chief architect (which is why it is also known as Augustinianism; see Study Guide page 113), while Luther and Calvin later refined and expounded upon his ideas. Due to the extreme length of this video set an exhaustive written review would be impractical.

Section 1: The History of the Debate

The video begins with an appeal to examine Church History and claims to trace the origins of Calvinism. Here is a quote from the narrator;

""We'll begin in part one of this presentation with the history of this controversy -the struggle to understand God's sovereignty and grace in relation to man's responsibility and free will."" (Study Guide, page 113)

After hearing the above quote, the viewer should reasonably expect this presentation to take the audience through the history of the sovereignty of God / free will controversy from the beginning. However, this is not where the documentary takes us.

The video continues;

""Now some may ask, ""Why begin with the historical survey of the debate instead of going right to the testimony of Scripture?"" Well, by neglecting the creeds, counsels, and other vital facets of the church's rich, 2000-year-old history, many Christians have fallen into the trap of having to rediscover what the Bible says."" (Study Guide, page 114)

The comments above give the impression that church history is very important, which it is. It warns that Christians should pay attention to when various false teachings have entered the Church so that we may identify them and steer clear. As great as all of this sounds their warnings prove artificial. The narrator immediately falls into the very same trap as those whom he seeks to show are in error when he uses Arius and the Council of Nicaea as an example. Take a look;

""What many do not know is that 1700 years ago this doctrine, with a few variations, was called Arianism after its chief proponent Arius. As his rationalized version of ""Jesus is not God"" theology began to spread like a cancer, a group of more than 300 pastors, elders and deacons came together in the city of Nicaea to discuss his views. The conclusion of that meeting or council was the condemnation of Arius and his teaching. Thanks to the tireless labors of great defenders of Biblical faith, most notably Athanasius, within a generation the heresy was largely defeated and contained. And so it remained for many centuries."" (Study Guide, page 114)

I will add to the above quote another thing many Christians do not know (and that the creators of this DVD set do not tell you); that Augustine, the hero of Calvinism, is guilty of precisely the same thing as Arius! Both of these men brought false teachings into the Church. With Arius it was the denial of Christ's deity, and with Augustine it was the denial of man's free will and personal responsibility (among numerous other things). Prior to Augustine, the Church uniformly taught free will and rejected predestination. The pagan Roman religions and the pseudo-Christian Gnostic sects are the ones that taught fatalism, or determinism, which the orthodox Church routinely refuted. Why is this not mentioned on the DVD?

Furthermore, the men who participated in the Council of Nicaea, whom the narrator calls ""great defenders of Biblical faith,"" were hardly Calvinists! Again, like all Christians that lived before Augustine, they believed in free will and taught against things like predestination, total depravity, salvation by faith alone, and eternal security. They would not agree with any of the five points of Calvinism, so how this DVD can refer to them as great defenders of the faith is beyond me.

Continuing on, they offer this quote from R.C. Sproul;

""Although tradition does not rule our interpretation, it does guide it. If, upon reading a particular passage, you have come up with an interpretation that has escaped the notice of every other Christian for two thousand years, or has been championed by universally recognized heretics, chances are pretty good that you had better abandon your interpretation."" ~ Dr. R.C. Sproul The Agony of Deceit, pp. 34, 35 (Study Guide, page 115)

This is just more talk about why we should value and consult church history. On the same page of the Study Guide, Dr. George Grant and Dr. Ascol add similar comments about learning from the Christians who have gone on before us, etc. The question then remains, why do all of these scholars disregard their own advise? Why do they completely ignore what the Church consistently taught and believed for the first three hundred years of it's existence, and rather choose to uphold a man like Augustine, who, like Arius, tried to change what had been taught as Apostolic doctrine from the beginning?

The Augustinian / Pelagian Controversy
Next, the video leaps into the 5th century controversy between Augustine and Pelagius. But why are we starting our ""church history"" lesson in the 5th century? What happened to the ""rich two thousand-year-old"" history mentioned earlier? Is this when the Church first began to think about the issues of predestination vs. free will? What was going on during the four hundred years prior to this? The video leaves the viewer with the false impression that either (1) Augustine was arguing for what the Church held to be orthodox teaching up to that time, while Pelagias was suddenly trying to promote a new heresy, or (2) the Christians prior to this event had no opinion on these issues. However, neither of these could be further from the truth.

There is no need for me, or anyone else who disagrees with Augustine, to defend Pelagius. Whether he was an orthodox Christian or not is irrelevant to this discussion. Disagreeing with Augustine does not by default make a person a ""Pelagian."" If you want to find a good representative of the Christian Faith you need to go back further than the 5th century. Ask yourself, why doesn't this DVD mention any of the faithful Christians who lived closer to the time of the Apostles? Men such as; Ignatius (AD 105), Justin Martyr (AD 160), Tatian (AD 160), Melito (AD 170), Theophilus (AD 180), Irenaeus (AD 180), Tertullian (AD 190), Clement of Alexandria (AD 195), Hippolytus (AD 225), Origen (AD 225), Novatian (AD 235), Cyprian (AD 250), Methodius (AD 290), Lactantius (AD 305), or Arnobius (AD 305)? All of these men (as you can see by clicking on their names) left a written record of their stand on these issues, and they were all against the doctrines that Augustine introduced around the year AD 400. This is compounded by another fact that the video conveniently fails to mention; that Augustine himself was a former Gnostic teacher!

Below are a few selections from History of the Christian Church, by Reformed scholar Philip Schaff, that back up my comments about Augustine's background. Please keep in mind that the video frequently quotes from this well known work, and that Schaff himself thought very highly of Augustine and mentions him throughout his writings with glowing affirmation. Read this quote carefully;

Philip Schaff
""The anti-Manichaean works date mostly from his earlier life, and in time and matter follow immediately upon his philosophical writings. In them he afterwards found most to retract, because he advocated the freedom of the will against the Manichaean fatalism. ... These works treat of the origin of evil; of free will; of the harmony of the Old and New Testaments, and of revelation and nature; of creation out of nothing, in opposition to dualism and hylozoism; of the supremacy of faith over knowledge; of the, authority of the Scriptures and the church; of the true and the false asceticism, and other disputed points; and they are the chief source of our knowledge of the Manichaean Gnosticism and of the arguments against it. Having himself belonged for nine years to this sect, Augustine was the better fitted for the task of refuting it, as Paul was peculiarly prepared for the confutation of the Pharisaic Judaism.""1History of the Christian Church, by Philip Schaff, Volume III, Pages 1012-1013

Here it is openly admitted that Augustine was a Gnostic Manichaean for nine years before becoming a Christian. Once a Christian, however, he accepted what the Church taught on the subject of human free will and wrote against the fatalism of the Manichaeans. Church historian Justo L. Gonzalez, in his book The Story of Christianity, says, ""Many of Augustine's first writings were attempts to refute the Manichees. Since he had helped lead some friends to that religion, he now felt a particular responsibility to refute the teachings that he had supported earlier. Since those were the main points at issue, most of these early works dealt with the authority of Scripture, the origin of evil, and free will."" Gonzalez continues, ""The question of the freedom of the will was of particular importance in the polemics against the Manichees. They held that everything was predetermined, and that human beings had no freedom. Against such views, Augustine became the champion of the freedom of the will.""2The Story of Christianity, by Justo L. Gonzalez, Vol. I, Page 213 But several years later Augustine ended up readopting his original Gnostic beliefs about predestination and read them back into the Bible. This is the real basis for Calvinism.

Schaff continues in a later volume from the same set;

Philip Schaff
""The Augustinian system was unknown in the ante-Nicene age, and was never accepted in the in the Eastern Church. This is a strong argument against it. Augustine himself developed it only during the Pelagian controversy; while in his earlier writing he taught freedom of the human will against the fatalism of the Manicheans.""3History of the Christian Church, by Philip Schaff, Volume VIII, Page 542

Did you catch that? The Augustinian system was ""unknown"" before the Council of Nicea! Mr. Schaff is certainly right when he says this is a strong argument against it. I would go further and say that it completely destroys Calvinism! Schaff admits that Augustine ""developed"" this system only ""during"" his debate with Pelagius. Are we really supposed to accept this as the true Christianity? I don't think so. Instead, we can rightly credit Augustine with polluting the Church with Gnostic beliefs. At least Mr. Schaff was honest enough to mention these little details in his work, which is more than I can say for this DVD set. The accompanying footnote from the above quotation goes on to mention that Calvin recognized Augustine's change of mind regarding the topic of free will;

Philip Schaff
""Calvin was well aware of Augustine's change on this point. ""Origen, Ambrose, and Jerome,"" he says, ""believed that God dispenses his grace among men, according to his foreknowledge of the good which every individual will make of it. Augustine was also once of the same sentiment, but when he had made a greater proficiency in scriptural knowledge, he not only retracted, but powerfully confuted it.""4History of the Christian Church, by Philip Schaff, Volume VIII, Page 542
Henry Chadwick, in his book The Early Church, commenting on the origins of Gnostic belief systems says, ""The influence of fatalistic ideas drawn from popular astrology and magic became fused with notions derived from Pauline language about predestination to produce a rigidly deterministic scheme. Redemption was from destiny, not from consequence of responsible action, which was granted to a predetermined elect in whom alone was the divine spark.""5The Early Church, by Henry Chadwick, Chapter II, Faith and Order, Gnosticism, Page 38 Wow, that sounds a lot like Calvinism, doesn't it? Again, this is the real origin of Augustine's interpretation of Scripture. It did not derive from the Apostles or from the early Christians.

After the Pelagian controversy the documentary takes another wild leap into the Reformation era. So much for the church history lesson! In reality, Calvinism rests upon the shoulders of a former Gnostic teacher of rhetoric from the 5th century and a few reformers from the 16th century. This cannot be considered the Apostolic Faith, but rather a perversion thereof. This video is truly a history of ""Calvinsim,"" and not a history of ""the faith once delivered to the saints."" (Jude 1:3)

2181318,2,B0006B46K8,"I first heard of this work when it was in production.  A gentleman whom I had become friends with was working on the script for Amazing Grace and we discussed it briefly.  I was very interested in the work and, given the involvement of a number of Reformed theologians, had great hopes for what it could become.  My friend surprised me one day by honoring me with a request to get involved with the writing of the script and sent me portions of it that were already complete.  I was humbled by his gesture of interest in my own work and I read eagerly through everything he sent by email.  It was no simple surprise that overtook me when I discovered that the script was, in my mind, so childishly contrived that it was embarrassing.  Perhaps the contrast with what I had anticipated heightened my sense of disappointment, yet my basic observations and criticisms remain.  I decided not to get involved with the script, which was already underway, and politely declined to be part of the project out of respect for my friend.

Later, in hopes that I had merely read a rough draft in the initial stages of development, I purchased a copy of the finished DVD and watched it through to the end.  I was sad to learn that it had not improved.  Now, for those who are leery of any attempted criticism, correction or rebuke, I will make it plain up front that I am a full, 5-point Calvinist.  I am not an Amyraldian, like so many professed Calvinists today, a position I take to be logically and Biblically sloppy.

Here, then, are some of my thoughts on what I observed in the video presentation:

1. The critique of Arminianism was, in the main, a tired caricature which would do little more than delight a congregation of our more polemically inclined Calvinist brothers and sisters.  It is of little use, in other words, because it ""preaches to the choir.""  Non-Calvinists would never feel that any attempt had seriously been made to understand them and to love them and, therefore, they would rightly dismiss this video.  Why do I say that they would ""rightly"" dismiss it?  Because context is what primarily defines meaning.

Biblical Love doesn't end with pure critique.  Even critique is not defined solely in terms of our vocalized contentions.  We say just as much with our attitudes, our actions, our careful concern, our fairness and overall integrity, as we do with our verbal opinions and arguments.  There are many layers of context which give meaning to our expressions and that is why, without love, says Paul in I Corinthians 13, even if we have all knowledge and understand all mysteries, we are literally nothing.  Non-Calvinists know this and in this video, they will feel it.  If we love them, then we will represent non-Calvinists in the strongest terms their view allows.  This video too often simply made fun of them or took shots at a weakened version which few modern Arminians or non-Calvinists would recognize.

Where there is a lack of love, there is a lack of real preaching of Christ.  We are only in such cases preaching of ourselves and thus witnessing for an idol... and a rather uncharitable one at that.  This is not an honor to our Beloved Christ but stubble to be burned on the day of reckoning.

2. The segments in which Reformed theologians were given the chance to speak could have been of real interest and help to the viewer but, instead, turned out to be simple expressions of opinion without any weighty authority.  As intelligent and respected as many of these men are, their opinions are not standards to live by, and of course none of them would want such responsibility.  The same could be said of the lengthy exploration of the events of Dordt which were analyzed in great detail as though the opinions of those men (learned though they were) are of serious importance and interest to non-Calvinists today.  Why should they be?  If there was a historic council which condemned Calvinists to be in error, would the mere fact of this convince any of us that we are wrong?  We would shrug our shoulders and move on.  Because of all this, I fear that only Calvinists will find these portions of the video of any use because of the lack of substantial argument in them.

3. On a similar note, much of the Scripture was quoted briefly without exegesis.  I don't know how many non-Calvinists are not already well acquainted with these verses or who would simply realize without help that the passages in question could only be given Calvinist interpretations, but I doubt any such people will encounter this film.  Simply citing verses that have been trotted out (and sometimes abused) for centuries to defend one side or another will, once again, offer little more than a mere sermon to the choir.

4. The historical portion of the video is often misleading and serves to perpetuate distracting associations.  Do the opinions of Pelagius have much to do with modern Arminianism?  In vague terms perhaps.  Unlike Arminians today, Pelagius believed that every human being is born without any trace of a sinful nature.  To him, we are like Adam before the Fall.  Pelagius believed that this is the ONLY just condition of freedom that would make man more than a simple victim of his circumstances and it allows ""God"" to escape being the ""author of sin.""  The Arminians of our day would be, for Pelagius, just as culpable of destroying human freedom and making ""God"" the author of sin as modern Calvinists would be.  And Arminians condemn him as a heretic just as we do.  Ironically, in some ways, the view of human freedom that Augustine outlined is very similar to the modern Arminian view.

As for Dordt, read John Owen's passionate critique, A Display of Arminianism.  It will open your eyes to the radical differences between the ""Arminians"" of his day (along with those confronted by the council at Dordrecht), and those we refer to as ""Arminians"" today.  The historical Arminians opposed by Owen and the Dutch Calvinists were very much like our modern Open Theists (who really are heretics) and, in some instances, historic ""Arminians"" even went so far as to deny the divinity of Christ.  Is it really so very fair to compare such people, especially without comment, to Arminians today as though they were virtually identical?

Some might argue that these historic Arminians are simply more consistent than modern Arminians and are, therefore, what modern Arminianism logically reduces to.  That may be so, and yet I think we should pause for a moment and consider that every error in our own thinking (and none of us are perfectly consistent Calvinists) would logically reduce to unbelief--perhaps even nihilistic idolatry--precisely because all error presupposes an ultimate authority at odds with our LORD.  If, then, our own errors would consistently reduce, ultimately, to a rejection of Biblical truth would it be fair to say that our theologies are comparable to historic heresies or that our intellectual forebears hyper-Calvinists simply because they share the name?

At times in the movie, these comparisons impressed me more as examples of the fallacy of guilt by vague association...

5. What is more, the presentation in Amazing Grace ignored for some reason the responsibility Calvinists have to address the more serious criticisms that have been advanced at our own view.  I can only imagine that most non-Calvinists willing to sit through the DVD for long will scoff at the basic lack of interaction with much of their own concerns and criticisms.  There was a sense that the team who put Amazing Grace together wanted to control the information so that only what they wanted the viewer to see and to consider was what they were willing to share.  Will this convince anyone who is not already firmly on their side?

On a more positive note: I thought that the connection between inspiraion and the exercise of the will of the human authors of Scripture was a good argument and worthy of consideration.  I hope that Non-Calvinists who see the video will at least consider this part of the argument.  Unfortunately, I think that it is buried in too much else that appears unfairly distorted and uncharitable (the graveyard scene comes to mind).

Brothers, if all we wish to do is congratulate ourselves and chuckle at everyone else, then by all means support the production of these kinds of videos and enjoy simple celebrations of confessional monuments and repetitions of the party line.  Perhaps that will prove of some use to homeschoolers who want their younger children to receive instruction in a simplified historical overview.  This can be of some profit to children so long as the simplified version is replaced later with one of greater and more honest nuances.  But if this production was meant to accomplish so much more... and I think it was... then we're going to have to live up to our reputation for doctrinal sophistication, maturity and depth.  We're going to have to love or we are not true Calvinists.

Calvinism is the foundation of true Biblical love, for as Christ Himself taught, those who are forgiven much, love much, while those who are forgiven little, love very little.  We, above all others, should know how much we were forgiven for we appreciate our wretchedness, our total depravity, better than anyone.  And if we do understand that we were forgiven much, and are not frigid pedants who talk without any genuine belief to warm our hearts, then we will love much more than all others as well.",1257120000,25,9479,4.802096177558569

I am now convinced that God alone is the only one who can truly explain His Word to our individual hearts. It's a personal relationship thing.

If you have questions about reformed theology, this is a great DVD to watch. As an added bonus, there are many great scholars from the refomred tradition on the DVD, people like R.C. Sproul, Tom Ascol, Tom Nettles, and many more. I recommend this DVD to anyone who is curious or who is wanting to learn more about the reformed tradition.",1230508800,2,453,4.746835443037975
2181328,5,B0006B46K8,"An important measurement that one can apply to determine the verity and reliability of a truth claim is to test its immutability over time. Real truth does not change. It withstands scrutiny, challenges, and calumnies throughout the ages without any need of retraction, revision, refinement, evolution or update. Upon learning the history and theology of Calvinism and Arminianism in this DVD, sincere reasonable students of the Bible would immediately sense there is something fishy about the Arminian doctrines merely by considering the fact they have undergone multiple contradictory changes from the days of Arminius; the traditional Arminianism; to their modern version in which the doctrine of the so-called prevenient grace was added as a significant deviation to answer the objections to the previous existing claims. Another modern deviation includes the death of Christ being the payment of sins, while the traditional view only claims Christ suffered for sinners, as quoted from Dr. J. Kenneth Gilder, a leading Arminian scholar.

On the other hand, to the best of my knowledge, the five points of Calvinism stand firm to this very day, and I dare to add, since before the creation of the world, without any addition, subtraction nor revision, because their solid-rock foundation is nothing but the inspired, inerrant and infallible Word of God.

Dr. Phillip Schaff puts it this way, as quoted in the DVD:
""Calvinism represents a consistent, logical, conservative orthodoxy; Arminianism an elastic, progressive, changing liberalism.""

Eric Holmberg rightly states that the root of the Arminian errors is the fundamental error in their view of the spiritual state of post-lapsarian man. He clarifies it by comparing the Pelagian view which is the seed of the Arminian error, the Arminian view itself, and the Calvinist view, that post-lapsarian man is well like pre-lapsarian Adam and just needs a teacher, sick and just needs a physician, dead and therefore needs to be resurrected by a Savior, respectively. Those mistaken in this view are bound to be mistaken in their views of the attribute of God, particularly His sovereignty and activity being subservient to the autonomous will of man, the nature of salvation being synergistic instead of monergistic, the efficacy of the atonement that doesn't save anybody, but it only provides an opportunity to be saved because a decisive factor is the individual's free-will decision to be saved which is an inevitable consequence of a synergistic view of salvation, and eternal security of believers that is precarious since it is dependent on one's will to remain in the faith or not.  On the contrary, total depravity, total inability to choose God, spiritual deadness necessitates salvation to be God's initiative and effort, through election, redemption, regeneration, and preservation. Here is grace in the fullest sense of the word.

But the implication of Arminianism reaches beyond TULIP, as Holmberg and other speakers point out. The teaching of human autonomy, the heart of Arminianism, inevitably affects our worldviews. One troublesome consequence is that it challenges the inspiration, inerrancy, and infallibility of Scriptures considering, what if what was written in the Scriptures was ""the fallible author's free will"" instead of God's will, asks Dr. Roger Schultz. Dr. Stephen Mansfield has the following to say on the pervasiveness of human autonomy,

""We could expect the idea that God choosing would be offensive to the rebellion of the human soul, but even more so in our culture where free-will and I'll have it my way is almost at an idolatrous level.""

To the Calvinists, grace is amazing because God is amazing, specifically in his gracious monergistic exercise in Christ to save ill-deserved spiritually dead sinners, and therefore He alone receives the glory; Soli Deo Gloria. To the Arminians, grace is diminished, and men rob a portion of the glory that is due God alone and claim it to be theirs, though they may not do it explicitly. The words of John Owen ring in my ears as I thought about this. I was wondering if he was too harsh when he characterized it as ""a proud Luciferian endeavor?"" (The Display of Arminianism, 1642), but it is hard for me to disagree.

Calvinists should get this DVD to solidify their conviction and kindle their love for the gospel truth. Arminians should get this DVD. May the truth be known, tested and embraced. Non-Christians should get this DVD because there is gospel in it; the best news anyone would ever hear that nobody should miss.",1221523200,,4561,5.1875
2181329,5,B0006B46K8,"Who could have thought that a presentation of Calvinism lasting nearly four and a half hours could keep me at rapt attention? Actually, I suppose most people who know me wouldn't be too terribly surprised. Amazing Grace - The History And Theology of Calvinism is an examination of the doctrines of grace, produced by The Apologetics Group. It is hosted by Eric Holmberg and is a collage of interviews, historical readings, Scripture and drama. It examines ""life's greatest mystery, that man's question for meaning and redemption is in the end the story of the Lord `seeking and saving that which was lost.'""

The presentation is divided into three parts. The first provides the historical context to Calvinism, beginning with the dispute between Pelagius and Augustine. It continues to a discussion of semi-pelagianism, focusing particularly on the dispute between Luther and Erasmus. The section concludes with a brief examination of what came to be known as the five points of Calvinism.

The second part examines the Biblical basis to the doctrines of grace as summarized in the acronym TULIP. Each is examined in the light of the Arminian controversy, in the light of the Scripture, and in light of the impact a proper understanding of this doctrine has on the Christian walk. It concludes with an examination of how Arminian doctrine has damaged the testimony and work of the church.

The third and final section speaks about the necessity of evangelism and provides pointers on evangelizing in a Biblical way. It answers the question of how God's sovereignty and human responsibilty interact in the preaching of the Gospel and the conversion of souls.

The participants who were interviewed extensively are R.C. Sproul, R.C. Sproul Jr, James Kennedy, Walter Chantry, Thomas Nettles, Walter Bowie, Roger Schultz, Joe Morecraft III, Kenneth Talbot, George Grant, Thomas Ascol and Stephen Mansfield. While all of them have much wisdom to impart, I was drawn especially to R.C. Sproul, who always looks like there is nothing he is more excited about than speaking of the Lord's gracious act of redemption. He leans into the camera, with a smile on his face, just bursting with enthusiasm as he tells of the works of the Lord and the doctrines of His grace. I also very much appreciated the inclusion of Walter Bowie, pastor of Koinonia Baptist Church in Jackson, Mississippi. So often it seems (in these parts, at least) that Calvinism is the refuge of the bland, middle-aged, amateur theologian. Yet Bowie, who is African American, lent some wonderful diversity and plenty of godly wisdom to the presentation.

Prior to seeing the DVD I was concerned about the quality, almost expecting it to be poor. Thankfully, I was wrong. Apart from a couple of very minor audio issues (for example, at one point during an outdoor interview wind blows across the microphone) the quality is top-notch. This presentation is well-produced, thoroughly researched and, most importantly, built firmly on the foundation of Scripture. While it deals with theology, it is practical throughout and is sure to help believers, young and old, Calvinist and Arminian, understand just how amazing God's grace really is. I highly and unreservedly recommend it.",1200960000,,3235,5.119318181818182

2181331,5,B0006B46K8,"This DVD has already received very good reviews that I can only echo. All I would add is just how important it is for any Christian, regardless of denomination, to understand the Biblical basis for any theological doctrine. This DVD explains step by step, the Reformed doctrine of salvation; and does so clearly and concisly, so that a laymen can understand it. It describes particularly well the Scriptural term, ELECTION. That God the Father, in His sovereignty, elects certain ones of the lost throughout mankind, from every tongue and nation, to salvation.

This Biblical truth is evident to any person who reads the Scriptures. Both Testaments expound on it at length. But people twist the plain understanding of the text to support their own religious philosphy that insists on the glory of man and his decision to be saved. We hear this preached all the time by educated preachers who should know better. Then it is repeated over and over by our trusted family and friends and think it must be true, because they are smart and sincere people, even though we realize decisional salvation is plainly unsupported by the Bible. We wind up expousing philosophy instead of Scriptural truth. What a mind bender this contradiction becomes as the years turn into decades, and the power of our salvation is stifled by confusion and delusion. There seems no end to the Arminian heresy all around us today.

That's why this DVD is so important to have and share with others. It clarifies the fundamental issues underpinning theological doctrines. It shows where wrong turns have been made in church history, and why orthodoxy matters. Get your fundamentals correct and build on solid ground. This DVD is a powerful tool to evangelize, not only to the unsaved, but maybe even more so to the saved. Set the captives free!",1195344000,3,1814,4.905537459283388

I'll admit it -- the whole sovereignty of God versus the free-will of man thing has been a conundrum for me ever since I started thinking about it as a young Christian. Eventually it became one of those issues I considered ""too high for me"" (like what the book of Revelation really means) - and I put my questions in the mental file marked ""The Secret Things Belong to the Lord."" (Deut. 29:29)

But the questions kept coming. When I prayed for people, could God change their heart unilaterally or was He waiting on them? Then I read passages like in Romans 9. So that put me on the other side of the coin, where Calvinism seemed to make God the author of evil and suffering.  Why would He only save some if He loves the whole world?  When I thought through these ideas, and the idea of man subverting the will of God because He wants everyone to be saved and yet many aren't, it made me reexamine my presuppositions.

This video did a great job of addressing the nagging questions in my mind and clearing away the fog.  I highly recommend it.  Even if it doesn't convince you of the Reformed position, it will focus your attention on the fundamental questions of specific doctrinal teachings on salvation and repentance, God's ultimate authority and sovereignty, man's will, and lots more... and it will get you thinking for sure.  And that's a good thing.",1194566400,,1617,5.264591439688716

I've seen some documentaries that make place for entertainment at the expense of thoughtfulness, but this documentary kept my attention by presenting the message in a way that was easily understandable without being ""only fit for those in ivory towers to be able to grasp"" (if there be such a thing).

Christians don't realize is the subtle way they can nudge the grace of God into the ""make himself acceptable"" camp.  This awesome series is the perfect antidote to this error.

2181337,5,B0006B46K8,"I have been a Christian since my youth, and likewise, I was an Arminian and didn't even know it.  I never thought that a study of church history would be so important and useful in exposing the heresies that have emerged throughout our Church's life, while at the same time pointing out and reaffirming the truths that great men of God have defended...truths that the Scriptures reinforce.

It's true what the DVD says, Arminianism is one step closer to the errors of the Roman Catholic (false) religion.  Is salvation only ""possible"" for the believer, or was it ACCOMPLISHED IN FULL by Christ for the believer?

I strongly suggest this DVD to both Arminian (whether ignorantly or not), and Calvinist alike.  If you are struggling with the word ""predestination"" after you've read Romans 8 and not quite sure how to take it in, then this DVD is for you.

The Bible tells us in Prv 22:28 ""Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.""

Our church fathers in history have seen the erroneous doctrines that have arised, and stood against them, defending the Truth.  Sadly, in our modern world, we have forgotten our father's landmarks and their experience in dealing with false doctrines.

We have slipped into the trap that is one step closer to universalism and a ""works religion"" that dilutes God's love for his elect, dilutes the power of Christ's work on the cross, and effectually causes us to commit idolatry by worshiping a false god, a god we have been taught by Arminian teachers and preachers, rather than the God of the Bible and His glorious and gracious plan of salvation.

Predestination is not a cause of concern for the believer, rather it should be a reason for joy and security in your salvation.  Once God wraps His fingers around you, you are NEVER coming out of His hands.  And it is all of grace!

The DVD has many wonderful insights from great theologians of our time, as well as a deep study of church history.  You will see that this debate is not new in our Church, but rather it goes back as far as the reformation, and you could even say that as far back as the Apostle's Pauls writings - for he foresaw the questions and objections that would arise from such a controversial subject!

The DVD uses much scripture and does a good job of clearing up any misconceptions you might have, and fixes any erroneous translations you might have of certain Bible verses.

As C.H. Spurgeon said, ""Calvinism is the Gospel"".  Therefore to depart from Calvinism is apostasy, and quite frankly, heresy.",1189468800,4,2528,4.696145124716553

It was just outstanding, and I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about this counter intuitive - but clearly Biblical topic.

With regard to the one negative feedback that I read here on Amazon, I would only comment that there is - in fact - no inconsistency between what is written in the Epistle of James and Doctrine of Predestination.  Simply stated, we are saved by Grace unto Good Works.  In other words, one is not saved by good works (i.e., one does not ""earn"" salvation), yet it is still true that ""a tree is known by it's fruit"".  In other words, true believers will clearly and necessarily have to bear good fruit in obedience to their Lord & Savior.

In Mathew 22:34-40, Jesus makes it clear that Good Works (e.g., ""Love your neighbor as yourself""), comes second - after the Greatest Commandment

(i.e., ""Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."").  Observing the Second Greatest Commandment without the first is ultimatly meaningless.  But, if you do the first, then the second must follow.  On the other hand, it is possible to do the second without the first - and that is crux of it.

Anyway, I thought it was a great DvD!",1174867200,4,1382,4.502008032128514
2181341,1,B0006B46K8,"""You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. ...For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead."" (James 2:24)

The theological debate has raged for millennia.  The Bible does not offer an unequivocal answer--as James and Isaiah, on one hand, the Pauline writings on the other, attest.  Augustine, Luther, and Calvin make excellent arguments against works righteousness, but this video deifies their arguments without debating them.  It never fully explained to my satisfaction where the crossover occurs, as many modern American Christians embrace free will ""choosing Christ"" for their salvation rather than the idea that God predestined them to be saved.  So they are Arminian.  But they see faith, not good works, as the way to salvation, so they are Calvinist.

This is a proselytization video.  It demonizes Arminianism as a doorway to the ""cancer"" of liberalism.  This cancerous legacy includes Charles Grandison Finney and the abolitionist movement of the 19th century.  Arminianism grew in popularity with the American democratic experiment.  Jefferson molded his ideas of checks and balances on Locke's Two Treatises of Government, not Calvinism (as this film contends).  This video proclaims that Arminians see the state as their salvation without ever giving any concrete examples as to what Arminian actually believes this.  One commentator even contends that the the ""republican-style"" Calvinism allows for a balance of power, while the ""democratic system"" of Arminianism leads to chaos and tyrrany.  (In fact, Calvin in his own time was accused of tyrranical theocratic rule, torturing and beheading critics.)  It is one thing to have a point of view, another to go out of your way to twist beautiful philosophical ideas into a political platform.

Calvin provided insight into Biblical interpretation that still reverberates, but I didn't get as detailed and in-depth understanding as I wanted.  The DVD spent too much energy arguing for Calvinism over Arminianism (aka Conservatism over Liberalism...even though I know Christians who would call themselves Arminian conservatives and others, Calvinist liberals).  And I didn't feel it gave a detailed, honest account of Arminianism's history.  Then it concluded with a fundamentalist exclamation point, decrying the perversion of modern times.

If you are looking for a biography of Calvin, a sophisticated parsing of his theology, or a comparison/contrast of the history of the debate on grace, this is not the film for you.  If you are looking for fodder for another hackneyed fundamentalist diatribe against relativism, humanism, modernism, liberalism, gay marriage and abortion, then this is film for you.",1154044800,18,2728,5.386792452830188
