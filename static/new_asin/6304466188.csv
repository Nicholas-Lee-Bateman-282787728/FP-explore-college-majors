881424,2,6304466188,"This is one of those productions that really has to be seen to be believed, and has more historical relevance than entertainment, my opinion.  This is a classic example of a Busby Berkeley production before the Hays Code (in place since 1930) began being enforced in earnest, due in no small part to Mr. Berkeley's excesses.

Judged on its own merits --- yes, it is offensive on many different levels, but it also features a meandering plot and some wildly uneven performances.  Jolson's film career was already in a plateau by 1934 and it shows here.  If one ignores the sometimes ghastly content, the musical numbers are nicely produced but are nothing particularly special.

This is a useful movie to keep in mind when people are lamenting the disgraceful state of affairs in modern arts and entertainment, and harken back to the ""good old days,"" when entertainment was much more wholesome.  Uh huh, right.",1098921600,4,909,4.87012987012987
881425,2,6304466188,"Wonder Bar is a nightclub in Paris owned by Al Jolson where the backstage dramatics more than equal the show being put on out front.  Dolores Del Rio and Ricardo Cortez are a dance duo that headline the show.  Cortez is a gigolo who uses women like Kay Francis, and Del Rio loves him in spite of it all.  Jolson is in love with Del Rio, and so is bandleader Dick Powell.  Passions and tempers flare.  To offset that drama, Guy Kibbee, Ruth Donnelly, Hugh Herbert, and Louise Fazenda are quarrelling American couples looking for some fun on the side.  They provide the film's comedy relief, but are not necessary to the plot and are given little to do.  Jolson does have a lot of charisma, which helps since Francis, Del Rio, Cortez, and Powell are given little to do and almost nothing in the way of character development.  In particular, I find the fact that Kay Francis was a big star in the early Thirties a bit puzzling.  I don't see the appeal.  The musical numbers are too long, and the less said about the very politically incorrect black face number ""Going to Heaven on a Mule"" the better.  Wonder Bar is a strange film that succeeds neither as a musical or a drama, yet at times it's fascinating to watch, sometimes for all the wrong reasons.  It manages to squeeze in comedy, romance, drama, murder, suicide, dance, and music into its short running time.  The mix doesn't work, but the film may be worth a look for those who enjoy films from the Era or for fans of Jolson.",1040428800,5,1482,4.424354243542435

881427,1,6304466188,"A movie starring Al Jolson, and featuring Kay Francis, Delores Del Rio, Ricardo Cortez and Dick Powell is suppose to be excellent entertainment, correct?  I found 1934's WONDER BAR to be a bit of an uncomfortable movie, even though I am a fan of pre-Code pictures.  There is a rather lavish, tasteless blackfaced musical routine by Jolson called ""Goin' to Heaven on a Mule,"" that most people today will find offensive.  One character who visits Al's nightclub is very depressed, gives away all his worldy goods,and wants to commit suicide--and he is actually helped to do this by Jolson's character, to cover up a murder in the nightclub!  Gays are also ridiculed--there is a brief scene where a couple is dancing and a young man walks up and taps the man on the shoulder and asks if he can cut in.  The man indicates it's okay...and the two men dance off together.  Jolson grins widely and says, ""Boys will be boys!""  There is also a rather violent dance between Ricardo Cortez and Delores Del Rio where he whips her!
I don't know...the whole thing just didn't seem very entertaining to me.  I guess I expected more, given the cast.  I know Jolson was a tremendously big star on the stage, but I'm not sure that his ""larger than life"" persona translated quite as well onto the silver screen.",996537600,8,1292,4.631578947368421

881633,3,6304466188,"I have watched a lot of Warner Brothers musicals this was not the best but by no means the worst. Al Jolson does his usual mammy thing in black face singing about a mule and heaven. It is reflective of the time this was after all the days of Amos and Andy on the radio at their height. It does go too far though more then other films which makes you uncomfortable watching it. Busby Berkeley has done similar numbers in other films with leads in black face I'm not sure why. The story line was a bit weak too was not clear who was with who or why. Dick Powell was great as always along with Guy Kibbee, Hugh Herbert, Ricardo Cortez and Dolores Del Rio they were all good. If they had Al Jolson just act and had not do black face I think it could have been an even greater film.",1388102400,,777,4.0519480519480515

Wonder Bar is one of the very last ""hurrahs"" for pre-Code Hollywood; the restrictive Hayes Production Code went into effect very shortly after this film was released. The often not so honorable action moves swiftly but the musical numbers are never rushed; Busby Berkeley's use of mirrors and extremely thoughtful use of lighting to accentuate even the tiniest of details impressed me greatly! For example, the way they used light to accentuate even the eyelashes on the beautiful blondes singing in one musical number shows such care about detail and I admire that. And although much of the film has ""naughty"" or much darker plot elements to it including murder, I also found it both interesting and soothing to see escapist fare such as the sequence in which the gentleman seeks out the lady whose shoe will fit her, as if she's a magical fairy-tale type of Cinderella--what a juxtaposition of themes there is in this film! In addition, Al Jolson's performances are wonderful although the ""minstrel show"" sequence is very embarrassingly dated (ouch).

I also couldn't help but notice certain things about ""Goin' to Heaven on a Mule"" in which Jolson's minstrel character ascends to a brighter, much better lit heaven from a darker world. This ascent to a brighter heaven seems, albeit in a much, much cruder way because of the stereotyping, similar to Dorothy from ""The Wizard of Oz"" entering Munchkinland and later Oz after she leaves her sepia toned house from Kansas. Indeed, Jolson's character enters heaven after knocking on a door and being let in by a guard who at first peers at them through an opening in the door precisely the way Dorothy and her friends are allowed into Oz to see the Wizard, which in this case could be seen as Saint Peter. And just like Dorothy (and her friends) gets a fine reception in Oz when they first arrive there, Jolson's character is warmly received by Saint Peter and the others.

The action itself all takes place in just one night at Al Wonder's (Al Jolson's) Wonder Bar in Paris; and there's certainly more than just one angle to the more concrete aspects of the plot! Inez (Dolores del Rio) and Harry (Ricardo Cortez) are a dance act at Wonder Bar; but things aren't going so smoothly. Inez loves Harry but Harry loves Liane (Kay Francis) who can't stand being married to Mr. R.H. Renaud (Henry Kolker); Liane wants Harry for herself and even more than that Liane wants to run away to America with Harry that night using money they obtained in a not so legitimate way. This leads to many complications just in that one night! We also see what happens when Al himself wants Inez to be his girlfriend; this leads to some surprises, too. There's also Captain Hugo Von Ferring (Robert Barrat) who people kinda-sorta try to prevent from harming himself, although just as the film industry was kissing goodbye to the pre-Code halcyon days the characters who benefit from Captain Ferring's generosity just can't stop indulging themselves for what could well be the last time, taking his money and more all the while ignoring the probable demise of the Captain much like the filmmakers were indulging themselves perhaps just one last time before the Hayes Code would be enforced. We even see the supposedly reserved older crowd fooling around as fast as they can behind their spouses' backs; watch for great performances from Hugh Herbert as Pratt and Guy Kibbee as Simpson with their wives played by Louise Fazenda and Ruth Donnelly. Add to that the young conductor Tommy (Dick Powell) who has his own eyes on someone at the Wonder Bar and you've got a really powerful plot going on!

The DVD doesn't come with any extras and that's unfortunate. I would have liked something more to watch but the film itself remains one of the better Hollywood pre-Code movies.

Wonder Bar is a must-have film for fans of the actors in it and people who appreciate pre-Code Hollywood films with musical numbers will not be disappointed. True, there are incredibly embarrassing stereotypes of African-Americans especially in the ""Goin' to Heaven on a Mule"" number but as others have noted we shouldn't delete this to pretend these prejudices never existed. I also agree with the reviewer who writes that considering some of the darker aspects of the plot and the subplots ""Goin' to Heaven on a Mule"" doesn't make the picture all that much more ""indelicate"" than it already is!",1380844800,,4410,4.820343461030383

I tired, long-ago, of those so-called ""reviewers"" of this film who moan and groan about the depiction of blacks.  Face it, folks, back in 1934 that was the perception...by most!

881638,4,6304466188,"One star off, I had to, for the songs (not a good one in the bunch, Warren/Dubin, Hollywood hacks) and the blackface finale.  Although (a paradox) this one (and every person in it was white in blackface) was actually slanted slightly pro-black (eg in heaven, a black and white chicken are in a cage, the white one gets fried and eaten, the black one lives on).  But -

The jokes (all were Jolson's) were actually funny.  One I loved (the first one) - Al sees a sad friend, the friend is sad because his wife just had their 5th child, the friend said he'd sworn if his wife had another baby he'd shoot himself.  Al says, ""Don't do it.  You could be shooting an innocent man.""

Clever, well-structured, dialog wasn't ""Casablanca"" or ""Sunset Blvd."" but got the story (and what a story!) clearly across.  As I heard Milton Berle shout at a rally (no, I wasn't there) when Jolson had finished a number, ""I can see why they call you the world's greatest entertainer!""  Jolson was wonderful.  If the man did have the massive ego he's disparaged with, it certainly didn't diminish his talent any!

I read in other reviews on this site that this flick was released just a few months before Hollywood censorship clamped down.  They sure took advantage of their freedom!

This is from Warner Bros. Arkive Collection and apparently is a DVD-R.  Whatever that would amount to.  Disc and case look perfectly commercial.  And the picture and sound were as good as anything else from the 30s.

881639,3,6304466188,"Wild, nearly surreal blend of sophisticated comedy, light suspense, and ridiculously elaborate production numbers, WB will live on as a celluloid-curio..of bad taste...if only Marlene Deitrich had a cameo!

Here we have the only Al Jolson movie where he plays a dislikeable character. Don't worry, he does play his characteristic guy from the streets who strangely gets taken in by ruffians and ""desperate women"". He plays a rather hard-headed Club Owner, with a soft heart - he constantly lets Ramon Navarro ""work him"" - the same dude who gets the eye of Delores Del Rio, Al's dreamgirl. As great as Al sings - and it is amazing to watch Jolson sing *live* on the soundstage and moving around - Ramon breaks out his whip during their lustfull Tango, and Delores gets jungle fever, in one of the most sensual close-ups ever filmed.

To knock off about two stars from this review is the well-known ""Goin' To Heaven On A Mule"" Busby Berkeley number, so stereotypical, so ridiculous with Jolson hopping around in a white, skirted robe, that the effect is almost stultefying. There's alot of terpsechorian talent in various settings and juxtapositions on screen...but this ""spectacular"" spot even got the attention of Joseph Cotton, the narrator of an *early 1960s* Television series, ""Hollywood And The Stars"", when Al Jolson's bio. came up and Cotten's voice-over expressed disbelief over this number.

The actual story about a robbery ar the Wonder Bar seems to borrow very heavily on an earlier Jolson movie, ""Mammy"". Don't want to give too much away.",1312243200,2,1551,5.003875968992248

Dolores del Rio loves Ricardo Cortez. Al loves Dolores. Cortez is in love with himself and he plans to go it alone in another city.

881740,4,6304466188,"""Wonder Bar"" has made it to DVD at last and that is cause for celebration. What a pity it is only as one of the very expensive Warners Archive Collection though, for this is an essential film from the thirties. Warner Brothers, the proletariat studio and experts at copying others, took the premise of MGM's 1932 hit ""Grand Hotel"", switched it to a famous nightclub in Paris converting it to a musical, then added their own brand of sleaze. This is pre-code Hollywood at its most outrageous so we get adultery, murder which goes unpunished and one very famous gay moment which makes your eyes pop with incredulity. Did I really see that? It's all here.

Busby Berkeley was riding high and he contributes two numbers, the lyrical Warren And Dubin hit, ""Don't Say Goodnight"" and the racist, crass ""Goin' to Heaven on a Mule"" sung by Al Jolson in blackface. The latter number, sometimes cut from prints, has survived on this DVD and it is worth seeing because seeing is believing. What was Berkeley thinking? That said, there are some impressive visuals and the orchestration and choir for the first part of the song are wonderful.

The cast is extensive. Al Jolson leads as the owner of the nightclub and easily dominates with his electric personality. Dick Powell is the singer at the club and Jolson wipes him off the screen, vocally and histrionically. A sulky Kay Francis plays an adulterous wife. Her beauty is eliminated by the stunning Dolores del Rio who can't act for nuts, not at this stage of her career anyway, but is so darn good looking who cares. She wears some very provocative dresses. There are lots of others in support from the Warner's stock company and they all have their moments. Some of the dialogue with Louise Fazenda and Ruth Donnelly is very funny. The film is also very well directed and edited, cleverly and smoothly weaving the multiple stories together.

The print is very good, much better than many of these Warners Archives films. While I would not hesitate to recommend it, it is really disappointing that the DVD is so expensive and has no extras except the original trailer.

881747,4,6304466188,"Wonder Bar is like Grand Hotel in a nightclub. It features many notable stars including Al Jolson, Ricardo Cortez, Dolores del Rio, Dick Powell, Kay Francis, and Guy Kibbee. It focuses on the love lives of each character; most mingle together and are rather complex. However, this is more of an exhibition of the actor's and their own personalities than an important film, but that makes the film fun since it has a great cast. It also features some extravagant musical numbers choreographed by the wonderful Busby Berkeley.

Al Jolson is the star of the show; he absolutely exudes personality in every step and really carries the film. Ricardo Cortez and the exotic Dolores del Rio carry on a tempestuous but tepid relationship but add nothing memorable. Dick Powell's part is small but his trademark boyish quality shines brightly. Kay Francis is adequate as an adultering society girl; her speech impediment is very cute. Guy Kibbee is a boisterous drunk as usual, and fun as usual.

The musical numbers are very fun to watch. They could never have been staged in the Wonder Bar, but they bring the audience to another world, something vital during The Great Depression. Berkeley plays with mirrors and beautiful girls to trick and astound the eye. The final number is a vehicle for Jolson; he dons blackface and dances to snappy jazz tunes in a black heaven. This number is filled with stereotypes like watermelon, mules, and shooting craps, but all of it is done in fun and was not meant to offend or discriminate.",1142899200,25,1519,4.838461538461538

In that time we get: a murder, a suicide, a cover-up, adultery, homosexuality, intergenerational flirting, gold-digging, racism, 2 gigantic Busby Berkeley numbers, Kay Francis and Delores Del Rio standing around looking captivating, and some glamorous art deco sets.  This has to be one of the wildest of all the pre-Code films, and certainly one of the ""last straws"" for the zealous censorship boards that soon got their way and started dictating what Americans could and could not see (hmmm...sound familiar?).  If you know how to enjoy good trash when you see it, then you will find the film irresistible.

As for the racist ""Goin To Heaven on A Mule"" number: yes it is in outrageously poor taste, but considering the smut and indelicacy of the rest of the film, it hardly seems out of place.",1102636800,63,1129,4.848958333333333
881749,2,6304466188,"""Wonder Bar"" is a place where nothing ever happens.

 If you recall that was the tagline for the 1932 best picture Oscar winner ""Grand Hotel"", that's the movie where Greta Garbo wants to be alone.

 ""Wonder Bar"" was a movie that tried to be another ""Grand Hotel"" only it is a major disappointment.

 The film deals with very serious issues including suicide and premartial sex.

 Like the 1932 film, ""Wonder Bar"" has its own all-star cast headed by Al Jolson (Al Wonder), Kay Francis (Liana Renaud), Dolores Del Rio (Inez), Dick Powell (Tommy), Guy Kibbee (Henry Simpson), and Hugh Herbert (Corey Pratt).

 The story goes something like this (try to keep up!) Al is the owner of a very sought after club ""Wonder Bar"", he is also in love with Inez (Del Rio), but Inez loves Harry (Ricardo Cortez). Now we have Tommy (Powell) who works at the club, he too loves Inez, in fact, the two were an item before. Meanwhile Liane Renaud (Francis) is cheating on her husband with Harry! Henry Simpson (Kibbee) and Pratt (Herbert) have decided to take their wives to the club, but the two men keep flirting with much younger women. And finally there's Capt. Hugo Von Ferring, who has lost all of his money to the stock market, and has decided to do away with himself.

 Now think, all of these stories aregoing on and it's all done to music! That was one fo the film's big mistakes.

 I know what a lot of you are thinking. So what if a musical takes on serious subjects, just look at opera. And you are right, but, the difference is in opera the songs serve a purpose. They justify the characters feeling. In ""Wonder Bar"" the songs take away from the plot. They are two seperate things.

 In ""Grand Hotel"" many of the same issues were dealth with, but, ""Hotel"" succeeds because it knew how to deal with its material.

 The material in ""Wonder Bar"" cries out for drama. It is meant to be taken serious, but for some reason it was decided to go against the overtone of the material and turn it into a musical.

 What does work in the film's favor is the suprising frankness of the script. Issues are dealth with head on. We know the captain wants to committ suicide. We know Liane has been cheating on her husband. We know what Kibbee and Herbert are up to. And in a turn of event that really surprised me Kibbee and Herbert's wives fo not take this lying down. They flirt with men as well, both wanting to achieve the same things.

 I always thought the production code went into effect in 1933, but, I guess I was wrong, because I don't see how any of this could have gotten past.

 ""Wonder Bar"" also has a disappointing ending. There doesn't seem to be a sense of a real ""conclusion"". We can't believe the actions some of these characters make. There are also missed comedic opportunities dealing with the Kibbee story-line.

 Both Kibbee and his wife have agreed to meet someone at midnight, now each has to get the other to go to sleep, but the film never shows us scenes dealing with that. In the process they pass a good opportunity for some laughs.

 The music in the film was by Harry Warren, one of the great composers of the times. Sadly the songs are not up to par with some of the other songs he wrote during the period such as ""I Only Have Eyes For You"", ""Lullaby of Broadway"", and ""42nd Street"". The best song in this film is ""Why Do I Dream Those Dreams"" the worst ""Goin' To Heaven On A Mule"", a perfect example of how the songs do not match the story-line, but insteadwas used as a showcase for Jolson.

 ""Wonder Bar"" had the makings of a great film, it's sad to see how things went so badly.

 Bottom-line: An unclever hybrid of drama and music. The story deserved to be taken serious instead comes second to the songs. Missed comedic opportunities don't help either. One big mess of a film.",1102377600,10,3796,4.41726618705036

7871721,3,6304466188,"This 1934 pre-code film had the makings of a 1930s classic: starring Al Jolson at his most energetic -- his number Vive La France, filmed live rather than synched to a sound track, gives perhaps more vividly than anything on film what he must have been like on stage -- the staff is completed by a panoply of Thirties film yeomen and yeowomen: Kay Francis, Dolores Del Rio, Ricardo Cortez, Dick Powell, and Guy Kibbee; the songs are mostly by Warren and Dubin, the production numbers by Busby Berekely. The story has something to do with Jolson's Paris caberet the Wonder Bar (""Wunderbar"" -- geddit?) as a setting for an interlocking set of frustrated lovers.

And yet the whole somehow doesn't gel together. Part of the problem is that the film uneasily combines a light musical with a murder mystery, giving the effect of two movies intercut with each other. And the running stock jokes and routines, obviously recycled from the vaudeville tradition, almost give the impression of a third film, a burlesque, thrown randomly into the pot. The Berkeley production numbers, while interesting, aren't as spectacular as in his masterpieces 42nd Street or Gold Diggers of 1933, Powell looks such a callow youth that he verges on parodizing his male ingenue persona, and Del Rio's habit of expressing every emotion by looking wistfully into the distance, even if she is in a small dressing room where there is no distance to look into, gets tedious after the eighth time she does it. A high point, though, is Jolson (who was born in Lithuania when it was part of Czarist Russia) singing a soulful rendition of Ochi Tchornya (Dark Eyes) in Russian.

The film's reputation for shock value -- some have suggested it was one of the reasons the Motion Picture Code was implemented shortly after -- will generally seem overstated today: there are frequent double entendres, some specific references to adultery and homesexuality, a murderess who gets away with it, and an outrageous Gaucho whip dance which seems too campy for anyone to get very upset about.

The really shocking sequence today, though, as anyone who has read other reviews will know, is the extended blackface production number ""Going to Heaven on a Mule,"" which wanders through about every racial stereotype about African-Americans you can think of. I suppose it has a social value as a startling reminder of just how acceptable such racism was in America until relatively recent times.

It's hard to know what rating to give this movie. As entertainment, parts of it are a lot of fun to watch, and though fairly tame by present standards, it serves as an example of what pushing the envelope was like in 1934. The 1930s women's fashions are luscious. I'd say those heavily into Thirties films, Al Jolson, Busby Berkeley, or the social history of popular cinema will find it worth watching, if they can steel themselves to sit through ""Mule."" Others probably will want to pass.

I saw it on the Warner's Archive DVD, which seemed a satisfactory transfer of a not too bad print.",1399766400,,3035,4.851351351351352
