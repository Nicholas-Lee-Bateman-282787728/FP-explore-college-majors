It's based on the life of Bobbie Dean, a boyish girl with excellent skills to play basketball. The thing is that she is not supposed to play ""real"" basketball (just the soft adapted version for girls) and her only dream is to do so.",1408147200,,377,4.25

Great reminder that we all need help in reaching for our dreams... And that giving up should never be an option.  Watched this with my 12, 10 and 6 year old daughters.  they loved it, too!",1350950400,,366,4.260869565217392
