8513322,4,B007AFBYEE,"Strangely, currently this is the only reasonable way to get eXistenZ on blu ray. Only a 2 channel audio mix and lacking special features unfortunately, so hold on to your DVD if you own it and want background on the film. Picture quality is definitely improved.
As for the film itself, Cronenberg uses some existing themes from Videodrome and changes the technology. Seemingly not as potent as his former work but still very good. He still has the ability to pull career defining performances from mediocre actors.
 I don't know about the other 2 films as they weren't my reason for purchasing. If I watch them, I will edit this to review them.",1444003200,,644,4.699115044247788

8513324,4,B007AFBYEE,"To be honest I have only seen one of the three films, and that one was eXistenZ. The other two I don't care about, but if you want to see eXistenZ in glorious high definition this is the disc to get. That's right. Forget the separate Blu-Ray release of the film from Echo Bridge. That particular disc has the movie encoded at a lower bitrate. While you may not notice any loss in the level of detail the movie's brightness level was also amped up for some reason. There is also a few contrast flickers and digital artifacts here and there too. This really kills the whole feel of the film. You are better off with this collection.

Now what's so good about eXistenZ? Well first it's a film by Dave Cronenberg, who is known for sci-fi that delves into interesting themes in films like Scanners, Videodrome, The Fly and others. This particular film is about a new gaming system called eXistenZ. In this game you plug into the game system (literally wiring into your spine) and get drawn into a game world that is so realistic you are hard pressed to know what is real and what is not. In this game reality different themes are explored including the concept of organic technology and the implications thereof and the addiction of gaming. You are thrown into the story in a rather rushed way that at first feels like a flaw, but in the end you realize it's part of the design. The main plot is a bit pedestrian with a sect of people who are trying to kill the designer of the game, but in that plot you get an excuse to explore the themes. And that's the whole point of the film.

Organic technology is showcased in this movie. It explores how such devices are created, including an underside to using organics. I have to say I like the exploration into this organic tech stuff. From the fleshy looking game pods to that creepy gun made of bone and gristle. It's a really different take into the whole thing. It makes the technology a bit gory while at the same time functional like an everyday piece of hardware.  Another part of this organic tech is how the players connect to the game using an implant on the base of the spine. There is a fair amount of sexual innuendo regarding the insertion of the plugs and even how the gaming devices are operated. So you have that theme and observation. Then you have an bit of exploration on how these organic systems are made and the ethical implications are there for you to ponder. Then of course there is the obvious theme of people so dependent on plugging into these games, and the extreme experiences you can plug into, that they seem to not want to be in reality. Again an astute observation and a bit telling.

Certain plot elements do seem to go to the extremes. For instance the fact that the game designer is practically worshiped by her fans like some sort of goddess, or a part in the film talking about how a game pod is dying and suffering from a virus. It gets too weird at times. Not enough to walk away, or even hate the movie. However it is weird enough to make you wonder just what was Cronenberg trying to put across. The film is also all about twisting reality to the point you will start to wonder if any of it was real at all. It's not one of those films that wraps everything up in a nice package at the end. It keeps you scratching your head all the way through. As cool an experience this is it does limit the watchability of the film. Once you experience it for the first time repeat viewings won't have the same edge, even if you do get a chance to catch details you may have missed.

You have all three movies on a single BD, and all films are presented in 1080i as opposed to 1080p.  That being said eXistenZ still looks a lot better here than on the DVD. The downside is you do not get any extras like the interviews with Jude Law and William Dafoe like you would get on the single disc release. Still if you ask me the interviews aren't worth the flawed video transfer. Maybe B Monkey and Malevolent are cool flicks, but if you wanted to get eXistenZ in the best looking format here is the collection to get.",1428278400,,4082,4.3363874345549736
8513325,5,B007AFBYEE,"I am writing about eXistenzZ.  Never heard of nor saw this movie before it was on one of the primum cable/satellite channels.  It is definitely different but I thought was well done for what looked like a low budget type movie.  Had some good twists and just a fun movie.  Not really scary but more like a little bit of a thriller and some suspense.

Definitely one of those gem movies that people never heard about.  I gave it 5 stars because I really liked it and didn't know what it was going to be about.  I know this isn't like a blockbuster hit or a movie I would rate against other big time movies, but a 5 star for a little lower budget movie.

It is about a video game like an  MMO type excpet it is with real people.  I guess you could say almost like virtual reality but no glasses or anything.

Anyways without getting too much into it, I recommend it.",1426032000,,864,4.175757575757576
8513326,4,B007AFBYEE,"I hope this doesn't dissuade people from reading my review, but I am going to primarily talk about Existenz on this disc. I am currently watching Malevolent as I type this and it's decent, kind of like a tv cop movie but starring La Bamba. As for B Monkey, I am not a huge Asia Argento fan, and the movie didn't do much for me. It's about Asia being an Ex thief who falls in love with a very straight laced guy. He gets pulled into some of her crazy ways and by the end you don't know if this couple will make it through.

Both of the other films are OK B movies, but nothing that will blow you away, or make you think the way Existenz does. I kind of wish they at least put other Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk/Biopunk films on here with Existenz. But oh well!

Existenz revolves around Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays a game designer who is on the run from a group of people in society who feel that making virtual reality games, or even playing them is detrimental to ones health & connection to the real world. It has a lot of undertones of what is real, and what isn't. The movie throws quite a few hints and plot twists and it will definitely keep you interested and thinking until the very end.

I wouldn't call this movie completely Cyberpunk due to the way the gamers jack into the game, which is through a very weird looking ""flesh pod"". They literally take an umbilical cord and plug it into a port directly in their spines. Sounds weird? This is Cronenberg, didn't you realize he loves mixing machines and human parts? =)

Overall without getting too far into the film as to not ruin anything, it is a great ride. And I was pretty happy with this Blu-Ray upgrade, even though it really could stand on it's own merits.

Video Quality: B (I thought all the movies looked fairly well, but Existenz looked like a nice upgrade from the DVD I own. Standard fare for these 3 or 4 movies on 1 disc that Miramax/Echo Bridge likes to put out.)

Storyline(s): Existenz: A+ , B Monkey: D, Malevelont: C.

Audio Quality :C (A little on the low side, and only 2.0 not 5.1 or anything like that.)

Aesthetics: C (The cover art is alright, but a little cluttered as usual with these set releases by Miramax/Echo Bridge.)

Price: B (It's worth it purely for Existenz, but I would say a $9.99 range would be a better pricing for these three films.)

Extras: F (None, I also love watching movies with subtitles. And sadly these aren't on the disc either
 =(

Overall: B (Existenz is the gem of this group, the others are just eh films in my opinion. If you enjoy a good sci fi film with a deeper meaning and some thought provoking visuals then you owe it to yourself to check out this film.)

*Update 1/4/13 - So I was right about to sell this copy of Existenz with the other movies and pick up the solo release that just recently got released. Thinking to myself, wow a solo release! It must look and sound so much better because of having more room on the disc and dropping those other films off, I was half wrong. After reading through a forum about the solo release it seems the picture quality is actually WORSE on the solo edition of Existenz, while the sound is better and has 5.1 implemented I believe. Where this release is just 2.0 stereo. I however do not have some crazy sound system, so I would rather have the nicer picture quality. I just can't believe the bit rate is worse on a single disc release, I would recommend getting this version over the solo disc in my opinion. Thanks!",1342828800,12,3474,4.334360554699538
