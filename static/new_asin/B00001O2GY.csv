1245819,4,B00001O2GY,"Overall, this is a good documentary. It has some good backstage footage of the All Century Team awards, including Pete Rose introducing his son (I think) to Ken Griffey, Jr. It's been a while since I watched it, so I don't recall some specific details, but I do remember it being a little brief with each player's biography. It's good for any baseball fan, but I guess I was just expecting a little more from it.",999129600,3,412,4.434210526315789
1245820,5,B00001O2GY,"I gave this video to my dad for his birthday last year. My sister gave him the accompaning book. He loves them and references them often. My dad lost his father 2 years ago and the greatest bond they shared was baseball. I can see the hands of time turn back as he watches the tape or turns the pages of the book. I know he wishes Grandpop was here to share it with him, but I think this helps him remember all the great memories they shared thanks to the game of baseball. He enjoys reliving those great sport moments made by the heroes of yesterday and looks foward to watching the today's heroes make their marks.",987984000,4,616,4.228813559322034
1245821,5,B00001O2GY,"I had received the VHS version as a birthday gift last year and this year received the DVD and I recommend it highly for any baseball fan.  The DVD has so many extras.  The players talking about their peers and some terrific video highlights from both the modern and older players.  If your a Cub fan like me, you will love the Ernie Banks section which includes the WGN video with Jack Brickhouse of Ernie's 500th home run...not just the home run, but the entire at bat!!!  Hey Hey!!!  The ceremony sections are terrific as well.  If you love this game, you have to have this DVD in your collection.",981936000,2,600,4.409090909090909
1245822,5,B00001O2GY,The movie is absolutely incredible.  The videography is stunning and their are even clips of the greats from the early 1900's playing such as Ruth and Walter Johnson and many more.  The narration is excellent.  This is  definately a well thought out and constructed piece.  It flows very  smoothly and features many quotations and interviews with hall of famers  and baseball experts.  The editing job is marvelous and it completely runs  the gauntlet of baseball history. In close I gave it a 5 star rating but I  would have given about a 500 if that were possible.  SUPER PREMIUM  VIDEO!,946252800,,589,4.78
1245823,5,B00001O2GY,"Throughout my life the one constant that I have always enjoyed was baseball, that's why it was so easy to review this video. Major League Baseball has produced a magnificent work of art.
Selecting the all time  any thing team and making everyone happy it a feat that has never been  accomplished before, this film is no exception. What is remarkable about  this film is how close to perfect it is.
Allowing the fans to vote at the  end of the century detracts from the meaning of the vote, as younger fans  do not have a true appreciation of the pure sense of the game itself. This  fact does not detract from the overall film in any way at all.
The thirty  selected from the over 16,000 players who have grace the diamonds around  the United Sates is a testament to the game. I am so very lucky to own one  of the truly priceless videos of my generation.",945388800,14,855,4.327044025157233
1245824,5,B00001O2GY,"This home video has unique and never seen video and film of the centuries greatest 30 players: Stan the Man, Big Mac, Ernie Banks, Junior,The Train, Walter Johnson and more.
Forget about Jim Grey, this tape is what the All  Century Team was all about.  If you are or want to give a gift to a  baseball fan, this is it.  Costas narrates.  It is the sport that can lay  claim to the century",944265600,7,388,4.175675675675675

7914534,4,B00001O2GY,"I bought this when it first came out and it was fun.. Interesting to see how much the game, and baseball history, has changed since it came out.",1378425600,,144,4.178571428571429
7914535,1,B00001O2GY,"My expectations were definitely not met with this DVD.

I really thought there would be much, much more about the actual event prior to the All Star Game at Fenway Park in 1999!!!!!!",1279756800,,182,4.515151515151516
7914536,5,B00001O2GY,Would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn more about MLB history or show their kids the right ways to play the game.,1271289600,,128,4.16
7914537,5,B00001O2GY,All the Hall of Famers on this team certainly deserved to be there and it is great to see highlights from their illustrious careers.  Also it was fitting that Pete Rose was included.  I remember seeing the players get recognied before that All Star game.  My only objection was the inclusion of active players. Some were only midway through their careers.  It becomes an apples and oranges type of comparison and now in retrospect we my want to rethink how highly we should value the performances of all those players that used performance enhancing drugs.,1208217600,40,556,4.821052631578947
7914538,3,B00001O2GY,"The DVD was not bad.  The bios and stories were well done.  The only reason that I bought the DVD was to watch the ceremony.  I think that it was misleading that it did not state that the whole ceremony was not included.  Again, not a bad DVD, but don't expect the ceremony.",1166227200,2,274,4.113207547169812
7914539,1,B00001O2GY,"This DVD resembles a frivolous VH1 countdown rather than an important historical documentary and celebration of baseball's best.  About 1/3rd of the players on the list are highlighted, essentially ignoring the rest.

Possibly the greatest injustice is the exclusion of Barry Bonds from this list.  Now the list was compiled prior to Mr. Bonds current aura of baseball invincibility but prior to the 1999 season he had won 3 MVP trophies (tied most in NL history at the time) and 8 gold gloves and was the only member of the 400/400 club.  Clearly, he deserved to be included.

Bottom line: Inexcusable.  Do not waste your time on this DVD.",1096848000,,640,4.825688073394495
7914540,3,B00001O2GY,"An opportunity lost. So much more could have been done with this, but was not. The entire DVD should have contained more details and more video of the beeter players. I was not impressed with parts of the documentary and do not recommend the expenditure for this rather short history of the games greats.",1055808000,,304,4.648148148148148
7914541,5,B00001O2GY,"This is a DVD for everyone - for modern fans, for those nostaligic for a former age, for modern players, and for coaches.
The sheer quality of the historical film footage is what particularly fascinated me, far more than who failed to be included but who ought to have made it etc etc which I am sure will bug some people. I have a feeling that the average standard of professional baseball in the post-war years became much higher than that of the pre-war wars, hence the absence of .400 hitters - especially pitchers who hit .400!
Although some of the pre-war players were doubltess great talents the exagerated claim made on video such that Walter Johnson pitched faster than 100mph is just laughable. Just as the fisherman's fish get bigger with time it sounds like the speed of pitchers becomes faster as the years go by. Footage of Johnson pitching is nonetheless fascinating because his mechanics are just as how people remembered him: effortlessly smooth and fluent. But then it is also obvious that his mechanics lack the dynamism of a similar side armer, namely Randy Johnson, who follows through with more thorough weight transfers to the front foot and thus with a flatter back at follow through. That, combined with the fact that Randy is much taller and whippier than Walter can only mean that Walter Johnson cannot possibly be pitching faster than 100mph. However, it is obvious that Walter does have remarkably late shoulder rotation - something that makes a pitcher appear much faster than he actually is.
Nonetheless a student of the art of pitching could still learn a thing or two from studying the beautifully fluent text-book pitching mechanics of a Walter Johnson, or a Lefty Grove. If that were not enough the superb color pictures of Sandy Koufax pitching are a wonder to behold. I couldn't help but put on the slow motion replay to study him over and over. His mechanics have always struck me as being perfection itself and the footage quoted here only reinforces this.
On the other hand Warren Spahn's pitching mechanics are by modern standards thoroughly Baroque. Gross leaning backwards used to be common fault amongst an older gneration of pitchers such as Bob Feller and Johnny Vander Meer, but Spahn outdoes them all with a degree of leaning backwards that would make a modern pitching coach go pale. It's a small wonder he doesn't fall over backwards and even more of wonder that he was able to maintain control of his pitches with mechanics like that.
Although being a pitcher myself it is harder to comment on hitting mechanics it is obvious that Ty Cobb's hitting mechanics are equally bizzare starting with the hands apart on the bat followed by a ridiculously large 'hitch' in which he almosts touches the home plate with the tip of his bat before lifting it up to start his swing. On the other hand seeing Ted Williams (in beautiful color) swing the bat is a joy to behold as a model of perfection. You can see how hitters in opposing teams used to come out just to watch and learn from him when he was at bat.",1016841600,6,3049,4.700934579439252
7914542,5,B00001O2GY,"I love this DVD.  I have watched it 20 times, and each time i see something else and learn something new.  This is a perfect gift for any baseball fan.
A++",1000771200,3,155,3.967741935483871
