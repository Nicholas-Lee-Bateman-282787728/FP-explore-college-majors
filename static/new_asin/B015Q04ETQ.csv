7445593,4,B015Q04ETQ,"**This review may contains spoilers**

Director Rahmin Bahrini along with veteran director/screenwriter Amir Naderi have obviously done a great deal of research in crafting this gripping meditation on the foreclosure crisis which continues to affect thousands of beleaguered homeowners in America today.

Michael Shannon steals the show as the Machiavellian realtor, Rick Carver, who found it more profitable to get involved with flipping foreclosed properties than selling ordinary real estate at the height of financial crisis in 2007. Set in Orlando around 2010, we first met Carver standing outside of a foreclosed property with sheriffs about to evict a homeowner unable to keep up with his mortgage payments. When it's discovered that the homeowner has killed himself, Carver callously expresses no sympathy for the man who just committed suicide.

The plot breaks into Act 2 when Carver evicts our protagonist, Dennis Nash, a laid-off construction worker who lives in his modest home with his mother (Laura Dern) and young son. The entire scene (variations of which repeat time and again) appears to be based on true events. Nash begs that he needs more time and that his lawyer is in the process of resolving all the problems. Carver and the sheriffs will only give them a few minutes to get a hold of their most valuable possessions and put the rest of the home's contents on the front lawn.

Nash and his family are forced to move into a seedy motel and it's there that he discovers some of his construction tools are missing. He gets into a confrontation with Carver's work crew at Carver's office, accusing them of stealing the tools. Carver is impressed by Nash standing his ground and hires him as his new assistant. Nash's ""Faustian bargain"" with Carver is the vehicle which allows us to view the tragedy of foreclosure victims and the shady practices of people like Carver.

Carver allows Nash to strip houses of fixtures and appliances and install them in houses that he's gained possession of, making a big profit. Carver buys additional appliances from a hedge fund manager who's soon to be evicted, and re-sells them to the government at an exorbitant rate.

Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the film are the glimpses we get of foreclosure victims, all with slightly different situations which prove fascinating. One heartbreaking victim appears to be almost senile and is completely unaware that eviction proceedings have been instituted. Another man threatens Nash with a firearm and tells him to gets off his property immediately. Others take Carver's ""Cash for Keys"" offer where the homeowner accepts $3,500 cash in exchange for keeping the house in good order until turning it over on eviction day (in an early scene, Nash must clean up a house that the homeowner intentionally sabotaged by allowing the toilet to back up).

After Carver agrees to sell Nash's old house back to him, Nash feels pressure to get out of the motel as soon as possible, since he's being threatened by a man he was responsible for evicting earlier. Nash sells his old home, much to the chagrin of his mother and son, who leave him after he shows them a much more luxurious place he's purchased.

The climax proves a tad bit melodramatic as a foreclosure victim's court case threatens to sabotage one of Carver's multi-million dollar real estate deals. Carver forces Nash to deliver a forged document to the court where Nash's former acquaintance, with whom he used to be on good terms with, loses his home.

The man subsequently shoots off his rifle as Nash and the sheriffs appear at his home, attempting to evict him. I'm not exactly sure that Nash's sudden change of heart due to his guilt feelings over his deal with the devil--and his mother and son's negative reaction to selling the old family--is completely believable, but I suppose the film's scenarists felt that Nash needed some kind of punishment for the Faustian bargain he made with Carver.

Carver's outright illegal move at film's end, along with his overall shady activities, don't necessarily undermine some of the earlier arguments we hear from him, legitimating his machinations. After all, the homeowners ultimately are responsible for keeping up with payments on their homes. The bigger picture of course is that many of these foreclosure victims bore the brunt of the financial crisis and were unable to get themselves back on their feet. Bahrini must be commended not only for educating the public about what the foreclosure crisis is all about, but also for keeping us thoroughly entertained.",1454716800,6,4575,5.007894736842105
7445594,4,B015Q04ETQ,"Andrew Garfield plays Dennis Nash who is a hard working man in construction down in Florida. It is the 2008 bank crash which has left the world  though not the banks  reeling from the greed motivated incompetence of financiers. Nash is about to find out how devastating this can be when the bank forecloses on his family home. This leads to him being thrown onto the streets with his mother and young son.

He thinks all is lost then a chance meeting sets him on the path to working with the man who evicted him. This comes in the shape of realtor Nick Carver (Michael Shannon). He is scamming the system to make money from other peoples misery as he has indeed done to Nash. However, every cloud has as silver lining and in this case that cloud turns out to be lined with dollars  lots of them. The irredeemably low Carver shows Nash how to do this through coercion, theft, lies  you name it. The problem is Nash has now become what he hates and his conscience is about to be shaken.

Now this is described as a nail biter and it actually is just that. It starts with the pressure and the seconds to act scenarios and keeps that going right till the end. Shannon nearly does the impossible here and cracks a smile, but in the end he doesnt need to as his dead pan approach and screen imposing self manages to out act nigh on every scene he is in  without mirth. It is always easier to play the baddie, but to do it convincingly and with a degree of ambiguity  albeit wafer thin  is just something special and he makes it look easy. A good supporting cast and based on a real story this is one of those films that may be missed due to the seemingly uninspiring title, but this is one you will want to tell your friends about  absolutely recommended.",1454112000,6,1749,4.304878048780488
7445595,3,B015Q04ETQ,"First, a few quick clarifications, per Paul Allaer's review: 1. It is not the Connor family It is the Nash family. 2. It is distinctly possible that the Nash family could have lost their home to foreclosure for several reasons, even though they might have lived there for 20-25 years: A. The film, in the scene on the dock with Carver and Nash, explains that Nash's Dad was a drunk who probably didn't pay his bills (I think Nash says he killed himself, not sure). It seems this father left the family in the lurch. And that might have included not making mortgage payments. B. The Dad might have refinanced, thus extending the length of the loan.

My critiques: A. Laura Dern looks too young to play Dennis' mom (and she acts at times like his lover); B. The whole defrauding Fannie and Freddie scheme is still a bit murky (The Big Short does a better job of making esoteric banking concepts a bit more clear); C. And the ending is a bit obtuse. Nevertheless, after awhile, I ended up liking it because it's not a happy ending. And leaves things a bit open-ended and complex.

On the whole, an important, if imperfect, film. Worth seeing.

7445596,4,B015Q04ETQ,"The first half of this soul shaking melodrama about the horrors of the housing market in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown is a devastating half a film.  The long sequence where amoral, greedy but smart and coldly logical Michael Shannon oversees the forced eviction of Andrew Garfield and family from their long-time home that he plans to take and then flip is as chilling, cruel and hard to watch as anything in a torture porn film this year.  And the very talented Ramin Bahrani even manages to make a slightly long-shot end of first act twist in the main characters behavior make sense.

But the second half, while still well acted and intelligent, cant keep up with the power of the foundation thats been laid.  The film starts to rely on coincidences and forced structure, and Shannons villain starts to feel a bit too calculated and Snidely Whiplash  both too all-knowing and all powerful, and yet too dumb at the same time.  After creating a topsy turvey world where it seems like anything might happen, we start to get a little ahead of the story, and can guess where the twists, betrayals and moral conundrums will be.

But all that said, this is still a strong and important film.  Mainstream movies that attempt to confront political and moral issues head-on are rare and valuable commodities, and if this isn't the home-run it seems destined to b at first, its still a strong double off the back wall.  Well worth seeing.",1451260800,29,1439,4.678571428571429
7445597,5,B015Q04ETQ,"This is an intense drama set in 2010 Orlando during the housing crash. Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) is a real estate agent who makes his living on foreclosed properties. Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) is an unemployed construction worker who meets Rick Carver under the worse circumstances. He hates Rick Carver as he moves his son (Noah Lomax  ) and mom (Laura Dern) out of their family home into a low rent motel filled with displaced families.

Through a series of events, Dennis ends up working for Rick Carver, becoming the man he hates, doing a job he hates in economic times that makes a person question integrity. Dennis performs tasks that are outright illegal, jilting Fanny Mae and the taxpayers all in an effort to recover his home.

The film is hard hitting as you feel the intensity, for better or worse, of people getting evicted from their homes. The film also questions government polices and bank policies but offers no solutions as the results opens itself up for easy graft.

7445598,3,B015Q04ETQ,"""99 Homes"" (2014 release) brings the story of the Connor family. As the movie opens, we see a real estate guy explaining to an Orlando cop how the owner of the house he came to foreclose on, ran and shot himself in the head. We then get to know Dennis Conner, a construction worker who gets laid off and before we know it, gets foreclosed on, and needs to move into a motel with his mom and his young son. Desperate for money, Dennis turns to the real estate guy who foreclosed on him, and starts working for him. What will become of Dennis? Will he turn to ""the dark side""? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Ramin Bahrani, who previously brought us the excellent ""Man Push Cart"". Here, Bahrani looks back at the tumultuous housing bubble that burst in 2007, causing millions of homes to get foreclosed on. Let me be clear that I am appalled at what happened, that the banks made very serious mistakes, and there hasn't been nearly enough accountability (both on the individual and the corporate level) for what caused the Great Recession. Surely there is a compelling movie to be made on that, but alas, ""99 Homes"" is not that movie. For that, the movie is far too one-sided and the story is brought with the subtlety of a bull in a China shop. For example, it is never explained in the movie how the Conner residence, which they have lived in since Dennis was a boy (meaning about 20 years), nevertheless is 'under water' and hence gets foreclosed on. It just happens. It's shame that Bahrani didn't take the time to pain a more complex picture. The movie's urgent pace (from the get-go, there is an urgent electronic soundtrack) is emphasized by the tons of hand-held camera work and 'in your face' shots. Andrew ""Amazing Spider-Man"" Garfield (as Dennis) has a pained look on his face, to emphasize the overall anger and bitterness. Laura Dern plays his mom (but somehow amazingly doesn't look all that much older than him). Michael Shannon as the baddie real estate guy plays that role perfectly.

""99 Homes"" opened in October in the theater, and the matin&eacute;e screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati turned out to be a private screening, as in: I was literally the only person in the theater. I couldn't imagine that this would end up playing very long in theaters, as the movie is too average, and the topic too depressing. There is a good reason why this movie has been sitting on the shelf for over a years since its debut at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. If you like to get hit in the head with a hammer over and over again that ""bankers are killers"", then you may enjoy this movie. I encourage you to see ""99 Homes"" for yourself, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw you own conclusions.",1448582400,6,2929,4.555977229601518
7445599,4,B015Q04ETQ,"The Grapes of Wrath was a book which took the nation by storm about how wrongly hardworking Americans in an economic crisis were being treated.  99 Homes is an equally relevant movie with that theme, in the form of a tragedy, almost structured like a film noir because there is a seemingly inescapable moral dilemma, and it really ought to make the same level of difference as The Grapes of Wrath.  I hope it stirs up public opinion to make some needed changes in our laws, to protect the average American better.  The case which 99 Homes makes is that the government, powerful people in the real estate business, and legal system are a cabal which doesnt identify with or care about the American peoples basic needs.

I am not sure how much I should say about the story, because I don't want to form a bias in anyone who hasn't yet seen it, but want the film to speak for itself.  It is a very powerful experience.  Andrew Garfield, who reminds me sometimes of Hayden Christensen, plays a flawed (smokes and cusses a lot) but well-meaning single dad, who lives with his momplayed by Laura Dernand his son.  His son is at elementary school age and becomes the movies most powerful voice of conscience, just through the look in his eyes as he processes the injustice and eventually questions his dads morals.  The problems begin when the 3 of them are kicked out of their home without fair warning and desperately want to reclaim what they feel is theirs, leading to a moral compromise by Andrew Garfields character, whos named Dennis Nash.  He gradually gets more involved in the criminal world of a powerful real estate broker named Rick Carver, played by Michael Shannon.  Theres almost no turning back for him as his financial security depends on continuing to play Rick Carvers games.

So there Ive given you a fair warning that it is going to be a hard-hitting drama about a moral dilemma, and I haven't told you how it resolves or whether its more painful to watch than its worth.  I think many people would say its worth only one viewing because of how intense and dark it is, but some would think its worth more than one viewing.  I think it makes its case very powerfully that the legal system needs more mercy for the average American.  How to do it is the job of the next leaders in Washington, D.C., but something has to change.  I don't know whether the basic flaws in our current system are exaggerated for dramatic effect in the movie, but I am sure that these types of things happen just as much in the American legal system as they do in countries which rule by arbitrary power.  I want this movie to be a force of change in our system, so that we can be a more just society.  A society is only as healthy as it treats its needy/weaker people.  (Andrew Garfield said in an interview that he views Donald Trump as the epitome of this social Darwinist view that the movie addresses:  If you succeed, you have the right to do whatever you can to advance your real estate properties, even at average peoples expense.  If you fail, its your own fault.  The individual will is responsible for success or failure.  Hence, if someones in a less good position, that person deserves bad consequences because he didn't work hard enough.  Its an attitude of self-reliance gone amok.)  I wish this movie success because of its social goal, even though I don't condone the excess to which profanity is used in the movie.",1448323200,33,3423,4.537459283387622
7445600,2,B015Q04ETQ,"Great theme, however cheaply made.
The camera moved so much in so many scenes it was annoying at times; this technique is used sometimes for some purposes including portraying reality, however they used it way too much.

I lost my home in 2008 because I did not pay it, yes I had a family, yes, I got sick, yes, I lost my business, however it WAS NOT the bank's fault, it was my own fault for not planning better, for not having a bigger emergency fund, diversifying, etc.

7445612,4,B015Q04ETQ,"Watching this movie is like waking up to my life every single day. It is paying ALL my money. All the money that I have and still being constantly threatened and harassed. It is knowing that living in my car is a daily reality. Because I have had vicious dogs set on me. I have been verbally viciously and physically threatened and harassed. I have nearly been killed from 2 fires. I live in constant never ending fear. I am awakened to a neighbor making noises like they are shooting me in the head at 4am. That is what happens when I go to sleep. IF I al allowed to ever go to sleep. Because of the loud ever constant gangster Rap base making my walls shake from cars left unattended while thugs go get high and do their drugs and god help me if I beg anyone for help. Forget asking anyone to put away the Marijuana. Or turn down that Stereo.

It of course doesn't matter that I had a life threatening tumor that required major surgery and that I was bleeding nonstop for 24 hours for months on end. These people where I live ALL found it in their hearts to drop heavy weights down on top of me while I tried to sleep after coming home from the Hospital. On crutches can barely stand up; there was no rest from their seige.

Months of all night pounding on my ceiling stereos being kept on yelling all night never ending impossible harassment. I still pay all my money and on time every month but it doesnt matter. And then even after I got a new lease they raised the rent on me again. And I can't pay it. I can't pay it. Even a legal document is suddenly meaningless. I have zero rights. An American law abiding citizen. Zip. Zero. No rights. A disabled person with severe health issues. No rights.

This is our world today. If people. If a Town wants to destroy a person. Completely destroy them. 24 hours of constant never ending purposeful harassment until a person either falls down dead or is left living in their truck holding a cardboard sign begging for help.

Or riding their used old barely functioning bike in 20 weather wearing rags rummaging through garbage cans and noone not one person will help them.

Or they just up and die from pneumonia in their cold barren apartment and the very next day all of a sudden a bunch of rich family members who never once visited a lonely poor man who had nothing was all alone--to cart away his tiny possessions.

If all of that can happen. This movie proves reality is true. This is the new America.

I know because I live it. I donate tons of nice clothes and nobody cares. I do my best and it is meaningless!!! This movie shows that people will just push you out and push you out and push you out.

I try my hardest to do good. And I am faced with relentless never ending harassment and balls out cruelty. To take the roof out from me. To put me and my Therapy dog out on the street. To basically kill me. Harassed constantly. Never ending.

America doesn't care if you are sick and fighting to live. If you also have a disability. If you are all alone. Even better. If you are all alone god help you. Because The meanest cruelest creatures will come after the weak. They will and they do.

I am preyed upon on a constant basis by the cruelest nastiest people whose main goal in life is to watch me lose my apartment, destroy any possible sleep or rest I could ever have; never ending threat of homelessness.

America is this movie.
The Rich will win. Thugs will win. Drug dealers will win. Are winning.
They will prey on all of us.

I may not be around much longer. Either.

7445619,4,B015Q04ETQ,"Excellent movie, well-acted, about a subject many people have no in-depth understanding of because of the spotty and sporadic way news media tends to cover substantive issues, especially when they are wrapped up tight in political rhetoric from the start.  I've spoken to many people who justified anything and everything the banks did regardless of evidence making clear they were far from above-board and some were indeed systematically abusive.  But they gathered their knowledge, such as it was, from preestablished political positions and sound-bite news media that reinforced it.  I don't see a lot of intelligent and informed discussion about these issues day to day, and so this movie serves a useful purpose in bringing home a least a bit of the issue to the average viewer.

These movies always have to build to a dramatic crescendo, though, and that's where and how the movie treads familiar ground.  The problem is, the moral revelation the main character comes to is not only easily predictable -- it reflects the same outlook he had at the start of the movie!  That whole business is so entirely predictable that I don't think I've given away any spoilers.  You can't see the movie start without already having in mind its most likely ending.  Anyway, sometimes those changes of heart feel forced, and I have to say that was the case here.  Frankly, in real life, I think things most likely would have gone the opposite way.

There was, however,  a nice gritty Glengarry/Glenross feel to some parts of the movie.  It was about ruthless people and people made ruthless by their situation.  And there was a nicely chilling speech, and a few bracing remarks, about moral choices vs. pure self-interest in a world that takes no prisoners.

Definitely recommended if you're looking for an issues movie, or enjoy procedurals of any kind, as you get a real feel for what these guys are doing here, like when you watch people putting a carefully planned heist together.

There are hundreds of thousands of wonderful films with difficult topics that have conclusions. Not just a guy sitting in a cop car. What the hell? The ending RUINED this movie.
You took excellent actors (Andrew Garfield, Michael Shannon, Laura Dern, Tim Guinee, Noah Lomax & others), craft a fascinating plot but then ruin it with a NON ending.
I also think that the director & script writer Bahrani & Naderi are sadistic. They filled up about half the movie with one eviction after another, like hitting the audience members in the head with baseball bats. Crying babies, shivering dogs, terrified men--horrific scene after horrific scene. The point would have been made with 4 of these scenes. Instead, it was about half the movie.
Did Bahrani & Naderi think this was a message film in 2015? Sorry but 90% of Americans were well aware of Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac's obsene loan scams through the newspaper & TV news shown over & over & over again. I participated in my town's Occupy protests against Wall Street & Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac.
I had hoped this film would show a banker or foreclosure king losing.
Instead, it was No ending. Just fizzle out like 100s of other recent films. You leave the theater just feeling annoyed, frustrated, irritated. If this was the objective of the director/script writer, then they truly are sadistic.
I HATED this movie (despite the fact that the actors did their jobs very well.)
My husband & I watch about 3 movies a week. My father (during the Depression) watched a movie a day, using his dime made from odd jobs around town. So I grew up loving movies. We watch many foreign films, as well as popular Hollywood type movies. My husband is an actor. He was in Zero Mostel's road show of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" when he was a teenager. He did 5 voices for a radio version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" which won many awards. He appeared in various TV shows in the 80s & 90s and continues working in local theater.
So we are not ""rubes"" regarding movies/theater.
I don't mind difficult topics but I DESPISE garbage endings like this one. We thought ""Hacksaw Ridge"" was sheer genius. October Sky was wonderful. (To name some films two of the lead actors in ""99 Homes"" were in.)
I hope Bahrani & Naderi quit making movies & go into the home building business. That would be a lot more constructive than their current projects.",1505779200,,2626,4.649462365591398

Too many people counted on riding it out in a free home. This story was too moralistic and one-sided. The freeloading mother especially got on my nerves, but mostly there was no real ending.

It's also a reality check about common occurrences today, so it will be a learning experience as well. The bottom line is people become attached to their properties, until the Sheriff shows up knocking at your door telling you, you're trespassing. My best friend works for the bank and is a real estate broker and is always armed when he approaches people to sign the cash for keys statement. Most people sign it which is smart. It's a true look at what happens when you don't pay your mortgage or second mortgage. This movie was just as interesting as The Big Short which was also excellent. Nowadays, investors aren't flipping houses. HUD is the new scandal. I've witnessed Board Members buying up properties and renting them to Section 8 tenants. This is so widespread, it would shock you, and I'm sure in 5 years there will be a new movie about this.

The reality of what happened during the big bust of 2008 was extremely realistic. People lost everything including their dignity and others made a fortune using questionable legal tactics and relying on an over worked court system.  Some got dragged into to job of dispossessing others simply because they had no where else to go.
For me, the ending was left ""up in the air"".  Did the real-estate brokers manage to avoid  penalties by continuing to use their questionable legal tactics?  Real life tells me that some did and others didn't.  Some of these people paid a price and others managed to worm their way out of any penalty, but unfortunately the movie never gets around to answering that question.  It's all left up to our personal knowledge of those events or to our imaginations. A more positive ending could have made this a 5 star movie.",1494201600,,1027,4.762711864406779

It's amazing what people will do for money.

Because of the housing crash lots of these guys came out of nowhere. There are even some around here. I never thought they were as bad as Rick Carver, but maybe they are. I had a chance to join in this game as the dust was settling from the crash and foreclosures and pre-foreclosures were everywhere. I overheard a conversation offering a home owner pennies on the dollar to stop a foreclosure. The bank wasn't offering this. They weren't offering anything. It was a group of guys that had figured out how to take incredible advantage of people at their most vulnerable moment. It was appealing in that you could make tons of money very quickly....but it was the way the money was being made. I just didn't feel good about it. I like to sleep comfortably at night and I knew I couldn't live with myself if I did this. You have to hammer down any emotions or thoughts of empathy to make it work.

They ripped off the government with the ACs and water pumps, but so what? The government survives by ripping us off, so is turning the tables on Uncle Sam enough to vilify them? In another setting, they'd be heroes.

All they truly did wrong, was forge a single unimportant document. Does it matter? Would the absence of that document have suddenly caught the homeowner up on his mortgage payments? Was the homeowner somehow unaware of his financial situation with out it? He's a thief and a parasite either way. Now I wouldn't say the protagonists were good guys, exactly, but to convince me that they were evil they ought to have done something much worse. As is, I ended up wishing the ending went the other way, and Rick Carver and what's-his-face went on to make even bigger bucks. Would have given it 5 stars then.",1486857600,,1148,4.627450980392157

Shannon plays a real estate man making lots of money off of other peoples misery. Business is booming so he grooms a recently displaced home owner as an assistant.

7445803,5,B015Q04ETQ,"The  2014 release of ""99 Homes"" got past ne in the theaters. Its 2016 Amazon release of 99 Homes captures the fears of many Americans who were caught in the 2007  housing crisis/catastrophe that shattered homes and families and the myth of The American Dream.""

Everyday working class people are portrayed superbly by Andrew Garfield as Dennis Nash and Laura Dern as his mother Lynn Nash. The most frightening character in the movie, real estate broker Rick Carver, comes to epitomize the predatory profile of the bankers and housing industry brokers who lived on a grand scale while ruthlessly mining the dark terrain of the unregulated banking practices that set everyday people up for failure.

Actor Michael Shannon creates a cold and ruthless real estate broker using quiet, calculated dialogue to rationalize his destructive actions. He evicts construction worker Nash from his home, using law enforcement officers to intimidate the family, then he lures the young father into a lucrative position that pits him against his own neighbors and other families in the same predicament. Shannon's acting just seems to get better with every role. This movie is a sleeping giant that that awakens fears in Americans that if it happened once, it could easily happen again.

7445971,4,B015Q04ETQ,"This hit pretty close to home for many of us who lived through the horror of the collapse of the housing boom in 2008.  Basically the politicians gave Americans the ability to capitalize on their own greed.  Clinton and Bush both encouraged people to get loans that exceeded their ability to repay, knowing full well that if the market started to stagnate or drop, these homeowners would be underwater.  ""Every American deserves to own their own house!!!""

This movie did a pretty good job of putting personalities to each side of the crash.  I agree with a previous reviewer.  This was better in its first half than in the final half.  But the acting was good, and the script was fine.  It really hurt to watch the first.  Almost like a documentary.

Some of us suffered collateral damage from the crash and won't ever make it.  I wish there had been more people screaming at our society to beware.  Instead, we just got the reality tv shows about how to flip homes and make a bundle.  And the FHA corrupting the process along with shady lenders.  And it almost caused the world economy to crash and burn...",1484697600,,1108,4.558375634517766

In fact this movie may be too upsetting for some viewers, as it deals with the real estate bust of the Great Recession in a grippingly realistic way. Relate-able characters and a storyline that reflects the complexities and gray areas that typify real life will keep you constantly engaged in the proceedings. It almost has a documentary feel to it, which augments the subject matter - no doubt many of the bit parts were played by local citizens, but all performances are perfectly natural and believable, not a phony moment to be found. Warning: if you lost your home to foreclosure, this movie could most definitely trigger PTSD so you should probably avoid it.",1483401600,,802,4.776978417266187

7446091,5,B015Q04ETQ,I do not normally write reviews but I think this one is worthy. The acting was excellent to portray those emotions and not just the lead actors.  I have had the experience first hand and this is 100% the reality of the situation. BOA FYI is Bank of America. Not sure if they actually said it. The government and the banks are thieves and it is a true depiction of what went down and what is going down in America. It is very seldom I have found a movie that is not a documentary to be factual and honest. They lied they stole and then they sold to make a profit off of homes that where legitimately and by there rules the home owners but if your money was not long enough or your attorney not good enough you was bought and sold an American lie. Next time you see someone who has foreclosed on a home before you turn your nose up watch this movie. It will shed some light on the truth of the matter.,1482969600,2,899,4.0790960451977405

7446098,5,B015Q04ETQ,"**SPOILER ALERT**
This movie is disturbing from both sides. Rick Carver is a shady realtor who lives high on the hog in a posh home as he forces default homeowners from theirs. He swindles and steals from the government and the banks that pay him to protect the foreclosed properties. It's all a money game because it pays more to take someone's keys on a foreclosure than it does to give them keys after closing a sale.
At the other end of the spectrum, you've got the evicted homeowner who would rather blame the man tossing him out than take responsibility for his own failings. Sob stories and threats get you nowhere when you owe someone money. Ask any loan shark, who'd rather break your legs than hear excuses. Homes aren't free. It's common sense that your days are numbered if you continue to miss those monthly payments. Plain and simple, you gotta pay if you wanna stay.
The moral to this story is that you can't be a swindler and have a conscience. You're either a good guy or bad guy. Sure, you can be the fun-loving bad guy like Carver but there's really no in-between.",1482796800,8,1083,4.50253807106599

Not realistic either since most people are well aware of their eviction date,,,sometimes months or even years in advance. The movie focuses hate towards ""bankers"" but not the corrupt politicians who created the 2007 mortgage collapse, It is clear documented on social media. So, if you just want to occupy yourself with a sub par effort, lead by a sub par actor, this is your movie.

The acting is incredible for sure, nothing is stilted- the actors and actresses are fantastic even down to the supporting cast and random characters that you don't even know the name of.  Now, though, the Carver- you get his motivated by money and what not but we never really are told why he connects with the main character- does he see himself in him? We don't know.

The film also has a message for the viewers- I think, but I'm not too entirely sure what it was supposed to be. I sure learned a lot about how to take advantage of people during a housing crisis but I doubt that was the intended message. And the ending was just, I didn't get it. But overall, very good film, I did stay invested the entire movie, never got bored which is why the ending was just so sudden.  Definitely worth a watch.",1481760000,,1102,4.3463414634146345

How real estate and banking interests took advantage of loopholes and in doing so showed no care or mercy for the working families who took out loans to pay off the homes they lived in or who took out loans on their homes and what happened when the fine print clauses demanded the balloon payments that many couldn't pay because the economy went belly up.  The government bailed out the banks; but, they left the people holding the bag and many people suffered, lost everything because of the wanton greed in the real estate and banking industries..

I would watch this for his acting chops alone - even though Andrew Garfield drives me crazy. He is good too, but just naturally irritates me. Unlike some politically centered dramas, this is not a speech by the writer, read through several different characters merely as a formality to get it 'out there'. There is real depth to the people presented, including some irrational activity to assure nobody is an ""angel"" and another a ""devil"". These are humans with clear motivations, and foibles.  Laura Dern is likewise convincing as all get out.  I can't give it 5 stars because it does, nonetheless, lean on the politics so much (quasi-documentary, but labelled as a thriller?), and Andrew Garfield's expert portrayal of a weak, weepy-eyed person in everything he is in just makes me want to shake him.",1473724800,,892,4.8618421052631575

Andrew Garfield is a young construction worker whose income has been sporadic due to the decline and he lives with his self-employed mom and son.

 I watched with stomach turning as Dennis Nash turned from victim to helping remove people from their homes. Due to following the housing issue closely, I was aware of the fact that people were foreclosed on without proper documentation and that many suffered.  But in knowledge there is power and the knowledge has produced watch dog organizations and some programs to give relief to the victims of the crisis.

The director gave the true story with heartbreaking scenes of families being given a choice to move all their belongings in the street and and elderly with little understanding having absolutely no place to go but a shelter.  The movie showed how heartless and callous some were or became.

I am not sure that I could have watched had I not known that there are now some agencies helping sort out the legalities to stop the illegal foreclosures and there are even some programs now giving more substantial relocation grants for those trying to get out of their under-water homes.

7446285,5,B015Q04ETQ,The movie 99 Homes is a very thought provoking movie . The DVD shows well and it is a definite tear jerker. The movie focuses on not just the evictions but the raw emotion behind foreclosure . A view of how many homeowners were victims of the corrupt financial empires . The banking and funding to people who actually did not qualify to the dishonestly and lack of help for eligible homeowners seeking modifications. The movie gives you a lot to think about . Many viewers will ponder the question of what would I do if face with these decisions? Great movie,1470268800,,558,4.480392156862745

7446343,2,B015Q04ETQ,"Screenplay is by Ramin Rahrani and is designed to make a social commentary on the housing collapse. In the process he exaggerates the characters and puts guns in their hands. I wasn't aware Realtors are armed. He exaggerates to enhance the plot.
I think most people understand, that whether you rent or buy a home, if you don't make payments, eventually there is a problem. Everyone in the movie was taken completely by surprise on the day they were forced out.
I understood banks avoid foreclosure where possible because they're stuck with non-performing assets on the books.
My understanding of the housing crisis is that it was created by well meaning government officials, concluding that denying homes to poor people had a racially discriminatory effect, and that loan agencies would henceforth be required to make home loans regardless of down payment or credit history.
The plot reminded me of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" for real estate. The Realtor forges documents, steals air conditioners and lies to a government agency while heartlessly evicting the unfortunate.
If you believe people should obey the law, you might find the movie disappointing.
I turned it off after 30 minutes, but then went back to find out what happened. It's okay. But the director's bias should be understood, that he is trying to prove a point, supporting his personal views.",1467417600,,1360,5.022123893805309

While the movie dragged a little at times, the complexity of the so called ""home ownership"" scams that I think continue to go on, was captured very well in this drama. I'm glad the story never resolved itself with a shooting or some other kind of violence or murder, though there were several times I thought someone was going to be killed.  The story resolved itself it a far more believable fashion and the bottom line with what is going on even today. (Florida remains in the top 10 foreclosures at the time I'm writing this; May 2018 from various publications). I recommend this movie highly for all of what I wrote above and more; good screenplay and director and also camera/cinematography work too.",1527120000,,877,4.658064516129032
