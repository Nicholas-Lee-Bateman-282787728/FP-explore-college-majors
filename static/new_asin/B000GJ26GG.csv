2614544,5,B000GJ26GG,"For anybody who wants to learn the techniques and rhythms of the tabla, I highly recommend you purchase this instructional DVD.  He takes you step by step on which finger(s) to use and he will do it repeatidly and slowly so that way you can understand it and play along with him.  There's alot more in there that he teaches, just take a look at it.  By next year, I'll be a pro or close to it. Thanks alot for the DVD, its really helpful.",1175731200,3,438,4.129411764705883
2614545,5,B000GJ26GG,"I have been playing drums, congas and Djembe for about ten years now. Most of what I've learned has been self taught,(books, tapes, videos and DVDs) after some basic classes. I have also played with an African drum and dance group for 8 years.  This DVD is an excellent product for the beginning Doumbek player(which I am). Starts with the basics:How to hold the drum, how to get the various sounds from the drum correctly. There are many practice rhythms that directly apply to the other classic rhythms that are demonstrated later on. The notation is clearly explained and it is easy to follow along with the DVD.  Amir Naoum starts with the basics of the rhythms and elaborates on them as each lesson progress's. Amir's presentation is geared for the new doumbek drummer and he appears to have a gentle sense of humor.",1168300800,8,821,4.694444444444445
2614546,5,B000GJ26GG,Fantastic material. Techniques are presented very didactically with rhythm notation on screen. Very useful for the beginner drummer.,1168300800,4,132,6.388888888888889
2614547,5,B000GJ26GG,"This is a well produced, high quality video that is perfect for the beginning Middle Eastern drummer.  The video follows the techniques, the rythms and combinations and variances of those rythms.  It is appropriate for a beginning level drummer, or for the intermediate drummer that would like to add some spice to their reportoire.  The sound is clear and camera angles make it very easy to follow along.",1167868800,2,405,4.926470588235294
2614548,4,B000GJ26GG,"This DVD is a very good choice for beginners and it also serves as good reference material for intermediate percussionists like myself.

The instructor is very clear and his technique is superb. The video starts with simple but important exercises that get more and more complex. All main Arab rhythms are covered and there are some nice demonstrations of what they sound like in a performance.

The one thing that is missing is an actual performance, where the viewer could see the different rhythms in a whole song, as well as have a taste of more advanced techniques, which are not addressed in this DVD.

If you want to start to learn how to play the doumbek or want to improve your basic technique this video is a must. It's probably useful for bellydancers and other musicians wanting to get familiarized with Arab rhythms.

Hope it helps.",1167782400,10,845,4.727891156462585
2614549,5,B000GJ26GG,"When it comes to insurrectional DVDs in general, I don't have high expectations, but this DVD was really excellent and left me truly surprised. I really like the way Amir Naoum breaks down the basic Arabic beats. I've taken some classes in the past, but having the beats listed off and easily accessible through the DVD menu as a reference tool has really helped me as a beginner/intermediate. The movie was well made, but I wish that he would have spent some more time on some the more complex rhythms. There are sections that he goes through way too quickly, and no matter how many times I rewind, I couldn't figure out what he did - specifically the last two rhythms- there's no way a beginner or intermediate can understand, and really requires triple the amount of time devoted to them on the DVD. But overall, I will defiantly recommend this DVD to any beginner or intermediate. For advance players, be warned that this movie doesn't go over combinations.",1166400000,2,961,4.6923076923076925
2614550,3,B000GJ26GG,"My overall impression of this DVD is that Amir is quite knowledgeable about the doumbek. I found it interesting that he presented the different types of doumbeks together with a brief history. Some of the editing is choppy, especially as he is explaining technique. I think he could have also spent more time going in depth into technique.  But when he goes into showing rhythms the editing is constant and the variations are quite interesting.",1164067200,16,444,4.92
2614551,5,B000GJ26GG,"Have you been itching to get drumming with a dumbek?  Amir will get you going with everything you need to know to get started!  The DVD is divided into convenient sections covering a welcome/introduction, rhythms, practices, and demo.  You learn about the dumbek, how to hold the instrument comfortably and how to perform your first few beats.  Then you can proceed with the practice drills or go on to learn to play AND recognize the popular and common Arabic rhythms.  The beat is counted out for you clearly on the screen, and verbally without being annoying.  Amir is a fantastic host and instructor, offering friendly and encouraging advice throughout the instruction.

I love how easy the format is to follow, you can go all at your own speed and pace, and navigate through the different sections and lessons by a simple click of your remote thanks to the convenient index of the lessons. Repeat a section as many times as you need or jump ahead to something more advanced...you won't be bored! The quality of the screen and sound is excellent, this isn't a shoddy homemade instructional DVD!

I'd like to note that Middle Eastern Dancers/Belly Dancers will also find this DVD a great resource even if you don't plan on learning to drum.  You can gain a great familiarity with the instrument and to instantly recognize the various Arabic rhythms by sound and name.  It will really enhance your dance experience.  I've found it invaluable for increasing my understanding of the music and rhythms I dance to.  After watching, you just might want to give drumming a try!

This DVD brings the beauty of the Dumbek and Arabic rhythms right to the comfort and convenience of your own home.  With some time and practice, you'll be comfortably drumming in no time at all, even if you've had no prior experience.  Those with percussion experience will appreciate the clear review of fundamentals and while learning some fun and exciting new rhythms.  It really couldn't be easier to get started with the Dumbek than with this affordable DVD.",1160179200,33,2038,4.829971181556196
2614552,5,B000GJ26GG,"Amir is an amazing professional musician and instructor, you will want to follow along as he breaks down basic doumbek technique and patterns.  As a serious dancer I am left with  better knowledge and understanding of Arabic percussion- essential in designing my drum solos, taxim sections of dance. Anyone at any dance level can benefit  from so much knowledge deposited right into your lap. Fundamentals of doumbek are simply broken down, complete with exercises and different patterns that you can use to follow along. Doum, tek, ka, pop, slap 5 -different sounds created from the tabla just by learning which area of the drum to strike. Anatomy of the drum, how the hold the drum,  also  combinations of these 5 sounds that create the nine Arabic percussion combinations, masmoudi,ayoub, baladi,saiidi, malfouf,maksoum,soumbati,ciftetelli, and some variations. Amir and Aziz combine the drum and tambourine,riq, for a beautiful demonstration  of patterns. A very valuable tool for learning and reference to drumming in bellydance. The quality of this dvd is great, color is vivid, overall an exceptional, purchase more than worth its price.",1159574400,18,1144,5.363128491620111
2614563,5,B000GJ26GG,"I bought this after the videos from drum enthusiasts online left me feeling lacking. This video is perfect to start learning. I play piano so I know what it takes to learn an instrument.  It's all here: introduction to the instruments and how to hold them, differences between drums, the sounds the drums make, how to make those sounds yourself, and practice drills, probably the best part. It's equivalent to drilling piano exercises.  I also enjoyed hearing the basic rhythm structure explained and played, and then hearing the embellished version. It gives both a place to start and a goal to reach towards. You can tell Amir Naoum loves his music, and he frequently expresses the hope that the viewer will love it too. He's very encouraging that by practicing the drills, the skills will come. That takes away the intimidation factor that comes as a beginner learner.",1451952000,,871,4.878378378378378
2614564,5,B000GJ26GG,Wow!!! Really getting the beat of things!!!! I am in love with this DVD.  I just can't put it to rest. All dancers in any level will benefit from this DVD. Great rhythms extremely comprehensive!!! SUPERB!!!,1437868800,,206,4.722222222222222

2614572,5,B000GJ26GG,"Simple, well ordered, and he speaks clearly and interestingly. My doumbek teacher likes it as well and is ordering it.",1391126400,,118,4.95
2614583,5,B000GJ26GG,"I am not a drummer but bellydancer enthusiast and I found this DVD to be excellent.  I had purchased another doumbek DVD to learn the drum solo rhythms (I am not very musical and they were  rather intimidating to my untrained ear).  Amir's DVD  is far superior to anything else  I have seen.  Amir explains the rhythms in a very clear fashion and there are also notes of each rhythm which appear on the screen while he is playing.  If  you are a visual learner, it is a helpful feature.

Update December 2013:
I recently found some excellent written material on the Internet ""Playing Along with Middle Eastern Rhythms"" that provides musical notation to some of the rhythms covered in the DVD, which really clarified the 4/4 and 2/4 rhythms for me and  how they are written/counted. Please see [...]",1387152000,2,798,4.635714285714286
2614584,3,B000GJ26GG,I agree with the other 3 star review that there is not enough practice time.  I am an absolute beginner. It is a great instructional DVD and I will definitely be referring back to it when I actually understand what I'm supposed to be doing.  In each tune he runs through the beat (sorry not sure of musical terminology) around 8 times and then moves onto the next level of how to play that tune.  It would've been great if I could loop each level of each tune for more practice time.,1375142400,3,483,4.228260869565218
2614585,4,B000GJ26GG,"I recommend this product to all beginner level players and to all intermediate players who are looking for different rhythms and approach.

Pros:
- Good video and audio record.
- The instructor is a great master in his Arabic technique.
- Very clear explanations about the strokes and rhythms.

Cons:
- Rolls are not covered.
- His technique is traditional Arabic technique. If you are looking for a modern and promising technique like Turkish technique (split finger technique) you will be dissappointed.",1346716800,,505,5.146341463414634
2614586,5,B000GJ26GG,"I really enjoy this DVD.  Amir is a good teacher.  He shows great basic classical Arabic doumbek technique.  Amir takes that further by demonstrating technique in the context of middle eastern rhythms.  Then within each rhythm Amir shows several, increasingly more complex variations to challenge your newly learned techniques. This DVD is good for beginners as well as seasoned drummers wanting to polish up their classical Arabic technique on the doumbek.",1318204800,,457,5.394366197183099
2614587,5,B000GJ26GG,"This video is of a thirty year veteran of playing, who has forgotten the harder parts of the learning curve.
He has a slick way of getting you to practice and play with him. After a month of watching a practicing, I wish I could meet him. If you want to learn the doumbek, Get this video.",1311120000,,288,4.0701754385964914
2614588,4,B000GJ26GG,"This DVD suits my needs, as I am a beginner and wanted to get some basic knowledge, rhythms, and drills at my fingertips.",1306108800,,121,4.304347826086956
2614589,5,B000GJ26GG,"I got into Middle Eastern drumming through bellydancing, which I've been doing for 2 years now. I can keep a basic rhythm enough to drum along with other drummers but I wanted to learn more about the rhythms frequently used by dancers, learn enough to play better at drum circles, open drumming at dance events, and maybe eventually to perform with dancers. So this went on my wish list.

I usually get bored quickly with instructional videos & they get dusty on the shelf, but I got into this one immediately. Naoum is a great teacher, seeming very accessible and personal, very encouraging. He presents the info in such a way that you can immediately get started with the basic rhythms, which is fun, and then layer on top if you can. His own hands are super-fast when playing the more involved rhythms, which can be a little intimidating, but if I can't keep up I either pause the screen when the written rhythm is up and do it slowly until I catch up, replay the practice, or just play the simpler one along until I feel I can add onto it. He himself encourages that rather than trying to do the whole DVD in one shot, you practice a section until you get it and move on. The whole thing is set up in a way that makes it really easy to keep practicing whatever section you want to work on.

In short, this DVD is fun, and Naoum is an awesome instructor. Rather than being intimidated by his skill, I feel like with regular practice, I could get fairly decent at this, which makes me excited to practice lots. Highly recommended to any beginner wanting to pick up the doumbek or similar drum.",1293926400,2,1595,4.403389830508474
2614590,4,B000GJ26GG,"Ok, Este Dvd me ha parecido bastante bueno, Amir explica de manera sencilla los ritmos y la tcnica, tambin he de decir que profundiza bastante en cada ritmo, mostrando las diferentes variaciones al detalle.

Lo recomiendo para aquellos percusionistas que estn en un nivel de principiante a medio y necesiten material para desarrollar y aprender tcnica y ritmo.

Saludos a todos.",1285200000,,378,5.180327868852459
2614591,3,B000GJ26GG,"This is a good DVD. Worth the money.  However, while most of the instruction is clear, as I beginner, I felt there is not enough practice time for each rhythm and variation.  For me its not enough to hear a few measures of variation.  I need a couple of minutes of uninterrupted playing that I can follow on my drum until I get my sound to match. He also fails to explain the traditional notation.  There is no discussion of rests or accents.  You have to fill this in for yourself

His treatment of the Ayub,  probably the easiest rhythm, and the second one that he introduces, covers the fundamental rhythm and then immediately moves on to a syncopated version for which he gives no notation or further explanation.  Someone who already knows how to drum  might be able to follow whats going on but I had no clue!  Ive listend to that piece about 10 times and I still feel I am only guessing.  Encountering this kind of stumbling block early in the course is discouraging.

This is a good reference disk since it covers all the main rhythms and explains clearly how to vary and embelish them but I feel its not suitable for a beginner starting from zero",1265932800,12,1155,4.421800947867299
2614592,4,B000GJ26GG,"A good basic introduction to doumbek techniques.  He breaks down the rhythym into an understandable language.  I bought it for my 9 year old nephew, but I found it to be very informative and useful.

It is what it says it is. Worth buying",1264982400,,238,4.363636363636363
2614593,5,B000GJ26GG,"I have owned my doumbek about 4 months. I've worked pretty hard at it from material off the internet (which I really appreciate), from a drum circle of peers, and from group drumming at parties. I just got into a quartet: guitar, mandolin, fiddle, & doumbek. Although many of my peers have more experience than I do, there is only one whom I would consider to be a 'good' drummer. The others I am surpassing, because I understand better than they do and because I work harder than they do. The implication is: I've got to keep at it!

I am also a decent amateur musician. I have an ear for sounds, timing, and style. It comes with experience.

This DVD is incredible! The Master is a master! He is very personable. I felt I was in private audience. However, I can imagine some finding disappointment. Why? Because this is mostly like a single lesson, a master class. Thus my title. If you buy this DVD you are buying a lesson, a wonderful lesson. Things are taught that are easy. Things are demonstrated that are challenging. Most of all, you get to meet the Master and hear what he has to say! And because I have it on DVD, I can relive it on demand!

Here's what I got from the DVD:

First, the exercises. They get me warmed up; practiced in patterns I need to know; and improve my rhythm, tone, and speed.

Second, the rhythms of basic reportoire and variation.

Third, the clincher: I learned the weaknesses of the path I was following. I learned a 'philosophy' of doumbek. This is what is amazing for a Master to accomplish without hearing me.

This DVD stresses the importance of the left hand and exercises it. It seems designed with awareness of the weaknesses of my experience. Why? My experiences were based on a fairly broad research of middle eastern drumming. I was following a common path. I was neglecting 'tek'. Sometimes I would drum left-handed, just to give the left hand something to do and give the right hand a break.

'Core rhythm' is emphasized. This, I was finding on my own. However, my peers don't seem to grasp it. They seemed to be mechanical, menu-driven. Without a sense of core, you cannot improvise effectively. You have got to know where you are coming from so you can get back to it.

My drumming is now better and will grow better yet. Mission accomplished!

I hope all others can glean from this DVD what I have. See you in the circle!",1250121600,4,2372,4.469907407407407
2614594,5,B000GJ26GG,"I am a beginner. I bought this DVD and another DVD about doumbeks. I liked this DVD more, because the exercises and lessons are easier to follow at the beginning.

2614598,5,B000GJ26GG,"This is the first DVD I bought to learn how to drum, and it will be my only purchase. It's that good. The production quality -- the look, sound, and camera angles were professionally done. The teacher is a professional musician who knows how to teach his instrument. This tape is for the beginner who has never picked up the instrument before and wants to learn the basics. He first gives a very short introduction as to the different makes of doumbeks and their pros and cons. He shows you how to hold the instrument and how to use your hands to get the correct sound: Doum, Tek, Ka, Slap, Pop and drumroll. We build from simple exercises to strengthen our hands, to simple Arabic rhythms, to more advanced variations. All the rhythms are written out for you and appear as a subtle graphic on the same screen as his playing. Very well done - you can both watch his hands and read the rhythm too. Makes it easy for a beginner to drum along. The menu chapters are nicely laid out -- you can jump to review the instruction on a certain rhythm or jump to the place where you can just practice it. At the end he is accompanied by another musician playing the tambourine and demonstrates all the rhythms and variations he taught us rolled into one playing session. This tape is entertaining and fun and I learned very quickly.",1190937600,2,1321,4.440329218106996

2614600,5,B000GJ26GG,"I highly recommend this video. It teaches you technique, although I think more time could be spent on the 'ka'. The top of the screen cuts off a little bit of the top hand when the instructor plays.

One other issue is that in one of the lessons the music and the video do not match up exactly, which is distracting. But I can let that go since the rest of it is just great.

The DVD gives you instructions and several practice rhythms which you should use whether you are a beginner or intermediate doumbek player.

The demos include a riq player as well, with a lot of improvised fill-ins to the primary rhythm.

Excellent tool and inspiring!",1187136000,,644,4.38655462184874
2614601,5,B000GJ26GG,"Although the introduction of this DVD is a little shaky and awkward the rest of the DVD is relaxed and he goes over alot of material. The production appears to be bare bones but the sound quality is very good.

Mr Naoum speaks with slightly broken English and stumbles over what he tries to say in the introduction. It seems like they did it in one take and didn't take the time to fix it so I was a little worried when I started watching this. At one point he tells us to remove rings before playing because it will damage the drum and also if you have skin on your fingers (LOL) it will rip the skin off.

When he starts playing it sounds fantastic.  The exercises are interesting.  The DVD menu is well laid out so you can find the different exercises.

If you play some instrument and can count beats but are new to doumbek then this cd is perfect for you. It moves pretty quickly and covers alot. Its a good value compared to taking lessons and would work well along with lessons.",1183507200,,985,4.245989304812834
2614602,5,B000GJ26GG,"This is exactly what I needed but couldn't find elsewhere (online, etc). Amir  has a relaxed gentle and encouraging manner, clearly enjoys the doumbek and wants to share his art. There is no fluff here, just nice visual of Amir nicely dressed sitting in a studio with colorful silk drapes & and a window behind him, & he gets right down to teaching after a brief self-introduction. His explanations are clear, the notations accompany the verbal and visual instruction, and his rhythms are slow enough to follow easily before he picks up the pace. He has a nice demonstration of different types and sounds of doumbeks available--he goes over 3 clay/ceramic types & both fish skin & synthetic/plastic. There are 9 drills for finger placement & technique, as well as for the basic arabic rhythms, with demonstrations as well that you can follow along with. A side benefit is that he plays with someone who is playing a riq (arabic tamborine) alongside him, which is almost a 2 for 1 because you can see how you would accompany a doumbek with a riq for each rhythm.
