7321293,3,B0112HPWZ2,"pretty good, but edicted too much. they cut it down to 3 discs. it really needed to be 4 or 5 discs long to get enough of the story. that's why i am giving it 3 stars.

they are cutting these soaps too short for dvd.

story: main character goes to mexico city with her friend to audition for a club called Chicago. while there, her house burns down, leaving her with nothing and a lot of debt. the owner of the club loans her money in exchange for a 1 year contract to pole dance at the club.

she then gets a second job as a nanny for a rich widower with 7 kids. she is the first nanny who the kids don't run off. they get close to her. she wants to quit the club, but the owner threatens to kill her. too much is cut out for dvd of the story. we don't see scenes of her trying to juggle her night club job with her day job, etc.

the widower dates a scheming woman that works at his office. he then falls in love with the nanny, but the other woman is pregnant, and he feels that he has to marry her. he then begins to discover what his wife is really like.",1469750400,2,1059,3.866359447004608

7321295,5,B0112HPWZ2,"I don't have this DVD set and probably won't get it, but I enjoyed watching this show when it was broadcast.

I will say this: ALL novelas cut down 90+ hours of the show down to 13 or so.  So most of the side plots and unnecessary characters will be edited out as well as most non-essential scenes.  ALL telenovelas brought to DVD do this, not just MCET.  I can tell you without having seen this product that probably most of the side plots dealing with the children were edited out except probably Sebastian dancing (b/c he's the producer's son).  Isabela's mom & the old folks were likely edited out. Most of the office scenes were edited out. Jhonny & Jenny probably didn't get a lot of airtime and the strip club scenes were likely edited out.  I'd be surprised if they kept the side romance of Fanny & Leon in there, to be honest.

It is what it is. Most novelas have at least 90 one hour episodes and it would be impossible to put the entire show on a couple of DVDs.",1462924800,,973,4.255434782608695

7321298,5,B0112HPWZ2,I watched the whole show when it was on tv and it's by far the best telenovela so far. Due to that they only made it into a 3 dvd set most of the important scenes were taken out. Overall it's a great telenovela.,1456099200,,211,3.8181818181818183
