Although it is accurately listed as being from the same date used in the ""Rust Never Sleeps"" film, SF Cow Palace - 10/22/78, I had purchased this thinking it might be a variant edit or something taken from an alternate film source. Nope, it's ""Rust Never Sleeps"" alright. You can do a song-by-song comparison and see that very quickly. Only, this DVD has a much poorer video quality, like it was taken from a several generations down video copy, or translated back from a PAL source. Stone River Studios, or whoever produced this, was thoughtful enough to excise both the Shakey Pictures logo and the film credits, so that Neil Young and associates would be spared the embarassment of having produced such a shoddy product.

On the other hand, Immortal (the Neatherlands based label behind this travesty) has also provided a two disc CD vedrsion of the film. Now, the original ""Live Rust"" album contained most, but not all, of the Cow Palace concert. If this CD set is in fact the complete Cow Palace set, that would be worth owning. Even if it does have a somewhat suspect origin.

I was lucky enough to see this Neil Young tour a day or so later down in LA (the night Neil Young's house burned down in Malibu) and to this day  feel it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen. The ""Rust Never Sleeps"" film is an accurate depiction of the experience. THis version is more like a hazy memory.",1193356800,29,1546,4.594202898550725
