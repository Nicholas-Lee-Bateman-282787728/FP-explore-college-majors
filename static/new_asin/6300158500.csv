213338,5,6300158500,"That one sure is a great film, not so much in the action or the exotic description of the Casbah of Algiers, but in the impotence of Parisian policemen to get a criminal who has found refuge in this Casbah, in the patience and the certainty of the Algerian policeman who knows the criminal will fall sooner or later, in the method used by this Algerian policeman to trap the criminal out of the Casbah.

Just use the simplest trap ever : a Parisian woman who is going to fascinate him in and out of his Casbah.

The refuge then becomes a prison.

The woman then becomes the bait used by the Algerian policeman.

The criminal's girlfriend becomes the informer of the Algerian policeman, and this is not a crime since he is Algerian and not French and since she is preventing her lover from falling into the arms of what has to be a trap or some bait and not a prize.

And then, when taken and handcuffed, he will have to get himself shot in the back by some French policeman, under the unmoved and unmoving eye of the Algerian policeman to escape the prison that is awaiting him in Paris.

Hence it is the story of a refuge turned into a prison, of an affair turned into a trap and of an arrest turned into an escape. Pepe le Moko is the best after all and no one can ever trap him and put him or keep him in any kind of jail.

213339,5,6300158500,"This film is very intelligent. I liked the plot and the dialog was very good, witty and clever. I loved the shadow and light in the casbah. I think this film was perfect for black and white. Mysterious,hidden and devious is what the color and Casbah portray, following the lines of the story. Boyer is so perfect in his role as Pepe Le Moko, jewel thief, hiding in the Casbah so as not to get arrested and extradited to his hometown, Paris, France. How he misses his home but if he goes out of the Casbah he is sure to get captured. He meets the beautiful and regal Hedy Lamarr, honest and forthright. She represents his home and he falls in love. One scene really got the emotions down pat, it showed Boyer going crazy from being trapped in the Casbah, the drums beating, the furor of his trapped feeling, you can see the panic mounting in him. This really was a wonderful movie! They based the cartoon character of Pepe Le Pue on Pepe Le Moko. Ending was also quite original and different. Some of the film is old and may cut out sometimes but still I didn't care this was a really great movie! I long to visit the Casbah!!

213340,4,6300158500,"This was the reamke of a French original. Goldwyn wanted his Garbo(SIGRID GURIE) to do it...  Sigrid later said that they all pitied Hedy Lamarr because she was thought to be a common girl after her nude footage in the film Exctasy 1933. MGM`s Mayer indeed was not sure of Lamarr was good enough for the MGM family and borrowed her to Walter Wanger.
As it turned out; Lamarr became a sensation, Gurie NOT! However, Lamarr did many a film but only the 1949 SAMSON AND DALILAH was an equal hit a`la ALGIERS.
ALGIERS had a poor print on video, but even on DVD the print is much 2 muddy. It is a shame, because it has an authentic feel... Indeed - when producing CASABLANCA, they hoped they coild achieve something like ALGIERS. However, faith was  not kind and CASABLANCA is the eternal classic. If u want 2 c Sigrid do a good performance, check out THREE FACES WEST with John Wayne and THE ADVENTURES OF MARCO POLO with Gary Cooper.",1062288000,,930,4.432748538011696
213341,3,6300158500,"MY RATING- 7.1
I watched this mov, knowing the legendary quote associated to Charles Boyer- ""Come with me to Casbah"". However, that's is only a legend and he never said that in this film.
This is the remake of a french mov (they say the original is the best) about Pepe Le Moko, the famous french robber hunted by the police, is brilliantly played by Charles Boyer. He has such a deep, velvet voice that I like to imitate!
Hedy Lamarr is exoticly beautiful, and she matches very well with Boyer as lovers. However, I feel that the romance is not very plausible, we don't feel passion as in Casablanca, for instance.
The supporting cast has a young and capable Joseph Calleia as the inspector of rotten Casbah and Gene Lockhart giving a fine but dated performance as a double-crosser.
Oscar nominations for Boyer, Lockhart, Art Direction and cinematography.

213342,4,6300158500,"This 1938 film is a remake of a infinitely superior French film Pepe La Moko, which starred Jean Gabin. Charles Boyer takes Gabin's old role as a notorious jewel thief who hides out in the Casbah in Algiers. Boyer, possibly a better actor than Gabin, is reduced to giving hot, passionate looks at the inhumanly beautiful Hedy Lamarr, who plays a Parisienne Society Beauty that Boyer falls for. Lamarr, with her slurry German-English hardly sounds like she's from Paris however. In short, this is a pure Hollywood remake, sacrificing eveything to glamour, with the over-made up actors and actresses. Even the sets look ... (the incopetent lighting gives it all away).

213344,3,6300158500,"Charles Boyer is a famous jewel thief hiding out in the Casbah, a section of Algiers famous for its winding streets and a perfect place to hide from the police.  He has a network of friends who help him, and all is good until a beautiful woman played by Hedy Lamarr enters and makes him remember Paris and love and the things he can no longer have while he is trapped in the Casbah.  Boyer is excellent as the edgy, clever thief, making the caged situation of his character very real.  Lamarr is beautiful, but a block of wood as an actress.  Gene Lockhart is very good as the man who informs on Boyer, while the rest of the supporting cast is adequate. Time has not been good to the prints of this film, and the quality of the image is poor, although that does add to the feeling of being undercover in the Casbah.  The director most have come from silent films, because the pacing and certain angles and shots are reminiscent of that style, although they are not appropriate here.

213425,5,6300158500,"""Algiers"" (1938) may very well be one of the finest films of all time. It was a sensation due to the stars - Hedy Lemarr and Charles Boyer, and many people believe that it was the inspiration for another film classic ""Casablanca"".

Hedy Lemarr (1913-2000) was one of the most beautiful actresses of all time, and her American film debut in this film launched her on a 20 year career that included films like ""White Cargo"" (1942), ""Tortilla Flat"" (1942), and ""Samson and Delilah"" (1949). She plays a French woman tourist who visits the Casbah and attracts the attention of International jewel thief played by Charles Boyer.

Charles Boyer (1899-1978) was everyone's favorite Frenchman. He was nominated for an Oscar 4 times, beginning in 1937 (""Conquest"") and ending in 1961 (""Fanny""). His most famous film is ""Gaslight"" (1944) although his performance in this film is often mentioned as one of his career highlights. Indeed, his character, Pepe le Moko became the inspiration for Chuck Jones' cartoon ""Pepe le Pew"" and the phrase ""Come with me to the Casbah"" became a famous pick up line in the 40s.

The cast also includes Joseph Calleia, Alan Hale Sr., Stanley Fields, and Gene Lockhart.

Joseph Calleia (1897-1975) appeared in more than 50 films, but is probably best known for playing Buldeo in ""Jungle Book"" (1942) and Orson Welles's sidekick in ""Touch of Evil"" (1958). I liked him best as the Italian lothario in ""Riff raff"" (1935). Calleia plays a French policeman and does the job so well he rivals Claude Rains' performance in ""Casablanca"" (1942).

Alan Hale Sr. (1892-1950) is best known as the frequent sidekick to Errol Flynn in films such as ""Robin Hood"" (1938), ""Dodge City"" (1939), ""Virginia City"" (1940), ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), ""Santa fe Trail"" (1940), and ""Gentleman Jim"" (1942). He has the distinction of appearing as Little John in the 1922 version with Douglas Fairbanks, again in 1938 with Flynn, and finally in 1950 in ""Rogues of Sherwood Forest"" with John Derek.  Hale plays a fence and associate of Boyer.

Big and ugly Stanley Fields (1883-1941) was a former boxer, to which his face easily attested. He played the muscle in more than 100 (mostly B) films, and is best known for his role in ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935) and in this film.

Versatile Gene Lockhart (1891-1957) appeared in more than 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actor  for his work in this film. The father of actresses Kathleen and June Lockhart, he's best remembered for his roles as the judge in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) and Georges de la Tremouille in ""Joan of Arc"" (1948), but I remember him best as Bob Cratchit in ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938). Lockhart plays a snitch and his final performance on screen is one to behold.

John Cromwell (1887-1979) directs. He was a Broadway actor who entered films at the start of the sound era. He made nearly 50 films from 1929 to 1961, but he was particularly busy in the 30s when he made ""Tom Sawyer"" (1930), ""Of Human Bondage"" (1934), ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1937), and ""The Adventures of Marco Polo"" (1938). When not directing he was a busy actor, especially on Broadway where he won a Tony in 1952 for ""Point of No Return"". Cromwell was blacklisted in the McCarthy scare.

The direction in this film is so good it should be used in film schools. Cromwell is in total command of the stage, moving the camera in/out, up/down, close/far to keep tempo with the plot and to advance the story. He knows when to dwell on an expression and when to cut quickly or fade away.

Walter Wagner (1894-1968) produced this exotic film, one of many films he made using foreign locations (e.g., ""Queen Christina"", ""The Bitter tea of General Yen"", ""Arabian Nights"", ""Joan of Arc""). In Wagner's 34 year career he was responsible for more than 60 films, such as the Marx Brothers first talkie ""Cocoanuts"" (1929), Fritz Lang's ""Scarlet Street"" (1945), Susan Hayward's ""I Want to Live"" (1958), and Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra"" (1963). Cleopatra was his last film and the only one for which he was nominated for an Oscar.

James Wong Howe (1899-1976) was one of Hollywood's best cameramen. He was nominated for an Oscar 10 times, including for this film, and won twice (""Hud"" and ""The Rose Tatoo""), making him one of the most acknowledged cinematographers in film history.

Howe's characteristic use of deep focus and dramatic lighting are well in evidence. He also uses many unusual angles which is not as characteristic of his style, but which he uses effectively.  His work in this film is superb. This may be one of the top 5 films ever made in terms of the excellence of the photography.

The film was nominated for 4 Oscars (Actor, Supporting Actor, Art Direction, Cinematography) but didn't win. The Oscars went to ""You Can't Take it With You"" (Picture, Director), ""Kentucky"" (Supporting Actor - Walter Brennan) ""Boys Town"" (Actor - Spencer Tracy), and ""Jezebel"" (Actress - Bette Davis).

Algiers came in at #10 in the box office. The top grossing films were ""You Can't Take it With You"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", `Boys Town"", ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", ""Sweethearts"", and ""Marie Antoinette"". Other notable films released that year were Cagney and O'Brien in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", John Garfield's film debut in ""Four Daughters"" and Gable and Tracey in ""Test Pilot"".

It's said that ""Algiers"" was the inspiration for ""Casablanca"" (1942). There are lots of similarities - the romantic leads share a love of Paris, the local inspector is an ambivalent character who understands the culture better than the outside authorities who are pressuring him, the female star is attached when she enters the city, the male star is outside the mainstream of the law, there is a cast of interesting characters hanging around and involved in their own plots, in the middle of the film there is a song that expresses the love of the hero, etc.

""Algiers"" is that rare film remake that is better than the original, made a year earlier and called ""Pepe le Moko"". That film has some differences in plot points (e.g., Lamarr is a mistress not a fiance) and stars Jean Gabin who is more like a French version of John Garfield, which some viewers might judge to be a better depiction of Pepe than the suave Boyer.

For a film with great atmosphere, great acting, and a chance to see life on the Casbah in the mid 1930s, this is a must see. The direction and cinematography are amongst the finest ever and the dialogue is as snappy and profound as it can be.",1303171200,10,6495,4.792486583184258

ALGIERS (1938)
Stars Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr. Cast includes Sigrid Gurie, Joseph Calleia, Alan Hale and Gene Lockhart, with just a glimpse of Joan Woodbury.

When he decided to remake the French movie ""P&eacute;p&eacute; le Moko,"" producer William Wanger tried but failed to have all existing copies of the original destroyed. MERRIE MELODIES fans surely recall the occasional Boyer (pronounced Boy-AY) imitation from this melodrama: ""Come wit' me to zee Cazz-bahhhhhh.."" etc. Warner's Gallic lover skunk Pepe le Pew was an homage (however redolent) to Mr. Boyer's le Moko.

""Algiers"" is glamorous Hedy's first American film.  She was considered for the female lead of CASABLANCA (1942) because of her work here.

SYNOPSIS--
French jewel thief Pepe le Moko avoids prosecution back home by hiding out in the colorful native district of the Algierian capital. Even though locally famous, confinement to the Casbah doesn't suit Pepe. When stunningly beautiful Gaby arrives from France on the arm of a repulsive fat man, Pepe is instantly attracted to her. The feeling is mutual on Gaby's part.

Stars Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr. Cast includes Sigrid Gurie, Joseph Calleia, Alan Hale and Gene Lockhart, with just a glimpse of Joan Woodbury.

When he decided to remake the French movie ""P&eacute;p&eacute; le Moko,"" producer William Wanger tried but failed to have all existing copies of the original destroyed. MERRIE MELODIES fans surely recall the occasional Boyer (pronounced Boy-AY) imitation from this melodrama: ""Come wit' me to zee Cazz-bahhhhhh.."" etc. Warner's Gallic lover skunk Pepe le Pew was an homage (however redolent) to Mr. Boyer's le Moko.

""Algiers"" is glamorous Hedy's first American film. She was considered for the female lead in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CASABLANCA/dp/6305736650/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CASABLANCA</a>&nbsp;(1942) because of her work here.

SYNOPSIS--
French jewel thief Pepe le Moko avoids prosecution back home by hiding out in the colorful native district of the Algierian capital. Even though locally famous, confinement to the Casbah doesn't suit Pepe. When stunningly beautiful Gaby arrives from France on the arm of a repulsive fat man, Pepe is instantly attracted to her. The feeling is mutual on Gaby's part. Their obsession with each other is complicated by Pepe's emotionally dependent girlfriend (Gurie) and by a savvy local gendarme (Calleia) intent on capturing the elusive Monsieur le Moko.",1279065600,5,1728,5.9

This one, though obviously not remastered, is fairly good for a 1938 film.  I would reccommend this version over the others here.

It's like watching an old reel to reel that is worn out and spliced numerous times along the way.

I bought the film merely to stare, open mouthed, at a  beauty that can only be described as unearthly. Small wonder old Pepe le Moko lost his noggin
over her. And this brings us to Charles Boyer. In the film he's supposed to be the kingpin of the most ruthless cutthroats this side of hell (the Casbah).
I don't buy it. If this little man, with his Pepe Le Phew voice and dreamy eyes were to suddenly attempt to mug me, I'd have to suppress a laugh. Jean

BUY THE OTHER DVD VERSION THAT AMAZON SELLS!!!",1161216000,15,446,4.5375

As far as video and audio quality, it is obvious that this DVD was recorded directly from one of the old 1938 copies of the film.  It has NOT been restored in any way.  You see a few scratches in the film every so often, and there is a slight hiss in the audio just as you would expect while watching a movie this old.  If you went to an old theater and they were running one of the original 1938 copies of this movie, this DVD is exactly what you would see.  It's a matter of personal choice if you will like the authentic look of this DVD or prefer your old movies to be visually restored with enhanced audio.

The movie itself is a classic.  It's a ""must own"" for anyone who is a collector of 1930's movies or a fan of Charles Boyer/Hedy Lamarr.  This is the movie that really introduced Hedy Lamarr to American audiences after she moved to the U.S. and left her Ecstasy days behind.",1161216000,32,1159,4.348837209302325

And, any fan of the Charles Boyer/Hedy Lamarr foreign intrigue/exotique film genre will enjoy it immensely. But, this copy might as well have been bought on the streets of Shanghai. The quality of the copy is extremely poor and even more offensive, midway through the film another conversation keeps taking over, what is it? ""DARK SHADOWS"". No mistaking the ""Dark Shadows"" music or Joan Bennett. I recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.",1151884800,5,569,5.0638297872340425
213471,4,6300158500,"[This review is based on a VHS copy, which doesn't have the quality problems the DVD apparently has.]

Charles Boyer plays arch jewel thief Pepe le Moko, hiding out from the police in the Casbah section of Algiers. Tourist Heddy Lamarr falls in love with him, and the passion really heats up. When Lamarr is tricked by the police into thinking Boyer is dead, she stays away from the Casbah; they know he'll come after her, and when he does they nab him. Joseph Calleia does a great job as the detective who patiently waits for Boyer to take the bait before netting him. The movie has lots of atmosphere and kitchiness, and the love scenes between Boyer and Lamarr are hot stuff, but the original [PEPE LE MOKO] starring Jean Gabin is a tad better, though the approach is much different. A classic from the 30s, it's worth a watch.",1143072000,,830,4.496688741721854
213472,5,6300158500,"Hollywood's remake of the french classic directed in 1937 by Julien Duvivier "" Pepe le Moko "" . Produced just one year later and directed efficiently by today almost forgotten american director John Cromwell ( "" Dead reckoning "","" Of human bondage "" ,"" Caged "" ), "" Algiers "" copies almost dialogue by dialogue and shot by shot this fatalistic and romantic french melodrama about a parisian jewels thief hidden in Algiers' Casbah who falls in love with a gorgeous tourist, born as him in Paris, that returns to him his hope of freedom. However, without forget in none moment we are talking about an almost literal remake, Cromwell's version benefits of an stylish and thick atmosphere that increase the tone of ironic fate that cross over the film since its begining. Charles Boyer replaces Jean Gabin in the role of Pepe,a character so ambiguous and elegant as his relationship with the inspector Slimane, a man whose higher ambition is to capture Pepe le Moko.

I highly recommend this film,but not this copy. Look for another better.",1121212800,9,1036,4.820224719101123
213473,1,6300158500,"First, 4 stars for the film, 0 for this version! This Alpha Video version (DVD) has a dreadful 20 minute sequence where some stupid Sci-Fi movie's audio dominates this movie's sound. Alpha should not produce/sell any more of these unless they correct the problem. Amazon sells another version, ASIN: B0002CR4GY (Release date 09/28/2004, one of the ones without a picture as of this review date, you can see the picture on another site perhaps) that does NOT have that problem. Buy that one instead if you want to see this film.

As enticement... the film opens thus:  ""Algiers. Where blazing desert meets the blue Mediterranean, and modern Europe jostles ancient Africa. A stone's throw from the modern city, the native quarter, known as the Casbah, stands like a fortress above the sea. Its population includes many tribes and races, drifters and outcasts from all parts of the world --- and criminals who find this a safe hiding place from the long arm of the law. Supreme on these heights rules one man --- Pepe le Moko --- long wanted by the French police.""

I loved it. This is a remake of the foreign film ""Pepe le Moko"" about this criminal (Charles Boyer) who is the ruler of what is also his prison, the Casbah, a dark and layered labyrinth that frustrates all of the French and Algerian authorities, except for one man. Slimane (Joseph Calleia), Pepe's rival and friend, slyly introduces the stunningly beautiful Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to entice Pepe to leave the protection of the Casbah. Will it work? Or will the conniving plans of others get in the way? If you want to know, then as Boyer said (actually, the cartoon character Pepe LePew said this), you'll have to ""Come with me to the Casbah!""",1119139200,23,1703,4.7272727272727275
213474,1,6300158500,"Boy, that other reviewer was right about the lousy production quality of this movie.  It's such a marvelous film.  Charles Boyer does a fantastic job as the master criminal who possesses panache, intelligence, and a desperate need to escape the casbah that is both refuge and prison.  Hedy Lamarr is luminous.  Such a classic movie deserves restoration, and those of us who love good movies enough to purchase DVDs deserve better than this.  Okay, I'm used to the faded, grainy, jumpy aspect of the typical AlphaVideo DVD, and am willing to put up with it just to have this film.  But the sudden intrusion of another movie's dialogue -- including a man screaming -- right in the middle of the story line is inexcusable.  I nearly came out of my chair in startlement.  At times you can barely hear Pepe le Moko's dialogue for this other, loud overdub.  If this is the only copy of this film you can find, it's still worth having, but be prepared for a really stupid production mistake.",1110931200,7,984,4.641618497109826
213475,5,6300158500,"What at first appears to be a somewhat film becomes fascinating,  full of atmosphere and great camera work.  Boyer is at the peak of his charm.  But the real reason to see the film is Hedy Lamarr.  She was probably the most beautiful woman ever on film and at her most ravishing in this film.  I sat stunned at her incredible beauty which has never quite been duplicated although Ava Gardner came close. A.Kaufman, New York, New York",1097712000,3,433,4.5
213476,4,6300158500,"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed ""Algiers"".  The combination of plot, atmosphere, music, and great character acting moved the film right along and kept my interest.  It's easy to see that this is what Warner Brothers had in mind when they made ""Casablanca"", and while ""Casablanca"" is a much better film, ""Algiers"" certainly does not deserve to sink into oblivion.
Charles Boyer does a fine job as a charming Parisian jewel thief hiding out in the ""casbah"" of Algiers (then a French colony); Hedy Lamarr, as the slumming tourist, is also very good.  There are good supporting actors in most of the other parts, including Alan Hale (senior), father of Alan Hale (junior) who was ""Skipper"" on TV's ""Gilligan's Island"".  Gene Lockhart, as the betrayer, is also a standout.
The ""casbah"" itself, part North African/part Hollywood, is also a star here. Lots of good set design and camerawork (James Wong Howe).  I was curious about the music: it's partially credited to ""Mohammed Igarbouchen"" (a.k.a. Mohamed Ygerbuchen) and I found that he also did the music for the French ""Pp le Moko"" of which ""Algiers"" was a re-make.
-- A word about the DVD:  millions of dollars were not spent to restore picture and sound quality and provide lots of extras.  Too bad.  This DVD, from Alpha Video, is just the movie. The overall quality is not pristine.  There are some scratches on the film and some noise on the soundtrack.  A film from 1938 could look and sound a lot better.  It looks like what's on the DVD probably came from a made-for-TV print, because the picture is slightly enlarged to completely fill the screen.  This is obvious at the beginning when part of the credits text is off the edge of the screen.  Still, as of this time, this is your only chance to get ""Algiers"" on DVD, and Alpha Video offers it  at a bargain price; my recommendation is ""buy it"".",1075334400,26,1869,4.693251533742331
