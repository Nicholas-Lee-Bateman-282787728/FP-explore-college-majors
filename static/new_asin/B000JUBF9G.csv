8153270,1,B000JUBF9G,"I used to be very fond of Charlie Rose's program and I was very interested in seeing his interview with Lee Scott, CEO of Wal-Mart. What I thought was that this interview would further expose the fact that Wal-Mart was failing its employees and, in many ways, its customers as well. What I found, watching the program, was instead a more or less non-stop pro-Wal-Mart and pro-Lee Scott advertisement invented by Lee Scott with Charlie simply listening, nodding his head, and saying, ""Uh-huh,"" pretty much throughout the hour. Later, a fellow I worked with pointed out that these sort of, so-called ""interviews,"" aren't like real news interviews and that probably Charlie wasn't even allowed to ask any unpreapproved questions.

I watched this program. I didn't buy it. I stopped watching Charlie Rose.",1183507200,3,801,5.068181818181818
