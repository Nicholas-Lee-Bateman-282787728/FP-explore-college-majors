8666126,1,B00LIBCN82,"I used to just turn this sort of movie off halfway through. Now I've found a healthier way. I pause the film, open up iTunes, try to come up with the most fitting playlist I can (often one at cross-purposes with the film itself) crank up the music and then resume the film. The results can be surreal and just wonderful. It can turn a one star viewing into a five.
I tried it here and got maybe a two. Meh. Anyway, if you insist on watching, here's your recipe for making it halfway bearable:
Playlist should contain equal portions:
-Beck
-PJ Harvey
-Mike Watt
-Jesca Hoop
-Beastie Boys
-She & Him
-Frank Zappa
-Tom Waits
I know, I've got an awesome music library, huh? Just makes me all that harder for the ladies out there to resist, huh? Aw, yeah...",1408233600,,752,4.340425531914893
