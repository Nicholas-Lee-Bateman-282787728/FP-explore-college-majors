8177401,2,B000NDIB50,"Terrible script, shoddy direction and sloppy editing.  The interviews lead nowhere and offer no new insights into Farrokhzad's life and work. Through the almost 3 hours of this documentary, no attempt is made to contextualize the poet in her social, political and cultural milieu. Not even Bertolucci's beautiful images make this film worth watching. The English subtitles are outrageously bad.",1255392000,6,394,5.566666666666666
