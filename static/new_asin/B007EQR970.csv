5079732,4,B007EQR970,"In New York City, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks in at the Roosevelt Hotel under the false name of Walker, goes to his hotel room at the top floor, and climbs on the ledge, apparently ready to commit suicide. The crowd below sees him and calls the police. They isolate the area, with Dante Marcus (Titus Welliver) controlling the crowd, while Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) tries to talk with Nick. However, he says he will only speak to negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks). Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nick's fingerprints from a cigarette they share. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman who was arrested for stealing a $40 million diamond from businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick, however, says he is innocent and reveals that Englander used to employ cops to protect his multi-floor jewelry business.

After going to the movies to see it, I expected it to be average or maybe a little better but I was surprised and it was a lot better than I expected. Even though a lot of people and critics gave it bad reviews, Man On A Ledge is still a great action/thriller and personally, I think it should've got better reviews but it just depends on the person.",1334793600,,1238,4.758139534883721
5079733,3,B007EQR970,"So this film has a man standing somewhere in Mid-Manhattan waiting to jump while the vicarious crowd looks on. He has a motive in mind, a game, he's trying to prove a point and what that point is, is basically the film story. Honestly, the acting was fair but the story is so poor and old school, in fact for a mere few seconds I wondered if I was watching one of the re-run of movies on HBO. I would strongly recommend skipping this film because it lacks a great story and doesn't aim too high.

Fair acting, average ""UNDERWHELMING"" story, overall if you don't watch this you won't be missing out on much so save your buck  for other 2012 films. Cheers.",1334448000,6,654,4.308943089430894
5079734,5,B007EQR970,"Sam Worthington is convicted of a crime he claims he did not commit. He goes out on the ledge of a building, in what we know early on is a diversionary tactic as he conspires with his brother (Jamie Bell) to prove his innocence. He requests Lydia ""Grim Reaper"" Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) to be the person to talk him down. By the nickname, her track record of talking people down has been less than desirable. She is hungry to save someone while fighting her hangover.

The film uses a good intense sound track to raise the thriller level as Jamie and his girlfriend (Genesis Rodriguez) attempt to prove Worthington is innocent.

Good intensity. Minor expected twists.

5079735,3,B007EQR970,"Can you spell ""diversionary tactic?"" This PG-13 heist film is a Master Class on film making: action, suspense, humor, pacing, you know...all the elements that keeps an audience smiling as we perch on the (L)edge of our seats.

We start out with a cop, wrongfully accused, who must break out of jail to clear his name. Have we ever heard this one before??? Naaah....

This time, we see:
  * Sam Worthington (""The Debt"" and ""Contraband"") as the cop. Breaking out of prison and climbing onto that high ledge is only the beginning....
  * Elizabeth Banks (""The Next Three Days"") is a police negotiator who lost her last client when he jumped off a bridge. She really does NOT want to lose this one.
  * Jamie Bell (""Tintin"" and ""Defiance"") is our hero's brother, using those diversionary tactics to steal a diamond which will help clear our hero's name.
  * Ed Harris (""The Way Back"" and ""Appaloosa"") is the wealthy industrialist who owns that diamond.
  * Edward Burns (""27 Dresses"") is a police official who wants to see this crisis brought to a happy conclusion...soon!
  * Anthony Mackie (""The Adjustment Bureau"") has been trying to help our hero...maybe....
  * Kyra Sedgwick (""The Closer"") is the comic relief: an on-the-scene television newscaster, always there, always wrong, always plugging away, no matter what.

No sweaty bodies, no gunshots, no vehicular mayhem, no profanity, no blowie uppie stuff. Why did we have such a good time? (See first paragraph.) We were almost sorry when it was over because this shell game was so much fun! (""Keep your eye on the pea...or in this case, the diamond."") Director Asger Leth and Venezuelan writer Pablo F. Fenjves did us proud. Let's watch for this pair for future projects. And Amazon.com will watch for the release date of the DVD and notify me.

I was certainly diverted!",1333843200,3,1824,4.829032258064516
5079736,3,B007EQR970,"""Man on a Ledge"" is a movie in which a man contemplates jumping to his death.  Who is he?  Why is this his chosen method of suicide?  And why  is he so insistent on dealing with a particular police negotiator?

Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is an escaped, convicted diamond thief with an elaborate plan to clear his name.  After checking into an upper-floor room at Manhattan's Roosevelt Hotel, he orders a hefty meal, then exits the window and positions himself on a ledge.  People below notice him and soon the police are called in.  When a cop attempts to talk him in, Nick asks to speak with a different negotiator, Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks).

Mercer has been ostracized by her peers recently because she lost a previous jumper.  Her self-assurance has been tarnished, and she is perplexed as to why this potential suicide has requested her.  The cops dust for fingerprints to identify the would-be jumper, but the room is clean.  So Nick's identity remains unknown to them for quite some time.

Ms. Banks never convinces us that she has risen to the rank of detective and been entrusted to such sensitive work as negotiator.  She has fashion model looks, and doesn't have the command the role requires.  A better casting choice would have been someone like Frances McDormand, Debra Monk, or Stockard Channing -- older women who could convey a harder edge than Ms. Banks.

Much of the plot involves a scheme Nick has engineered, and we gradually see it unfold.  It is convoluted, depends on split-second timing, and is the kind of plan that could work only in a screenwriter's imagination.

Worthington (""Avatar"") is adequate as the enigmatic man on the ledge, though he fails to bring any distinction to the role.  His Nick is determined to call the shots, and it soon becomes obvious that his threat to jump is masking a far more clandestine plan.

The supporting cast is impressive.  Jamie Bell plays Nick's brother, Joey; Anthony Mackie is Nick's former co-worker; stone-faced Titus Welliver plays the cop in charge of the operation to get Nick off the ledge; and Edward Burns plays Det. Dougherty, the negotiator Lydia replaces.

As a thriller, ""Man on a Ledge"" works reasonably well.  A large part of the movie involves an intricate caper that occurs as Nick teeters 25 floors above the street.  The mystery unfolds as the police, Nick's family, a wealthy businessman (Ed Harris), dirty cops, and Nick himself converge in the film's denouement.

Rated PG-13, ""Man on a Ledge"" is not a bad movie, just a so-so one.  There's a sense that we've seen the film before and the screenwriter has cobbled together scenes from previous movies.  For a theatrical film, it has a decidedly TV-movie feel, although the crowd scenes and New York filming are impressive.  Asger Leth is a competent director, not an inspired one.  He has a good sense of pace and the movie never bogs down.",1333324800,43,2888,4.801217038539554
5079737,4,B007EQR970,"Not an award winner, but it was good entertainment.  It begins with a man checking into the Roosevelt Hotel in Mid-town New York.  He orders an expensive meal and champaigne, calmly eats, then steps out onto the window ledge from the 21st floor.

Flash back one month earlier, a former cop, he was in Sing Sing on a 25 year sentence for theft.  His appeal was denied.  When his father died, he was allowed to attend the funeral and escaped.  Now he is an escaped felon and suicidal.  He claims to be innocent, but nobody wants to hear it.  So, he steps out on the ledge and asks to talk to Detective Lydia Mercer, or he will jump.

It's an interesting film with a few surprises.",1329004800,,678,4.317460317460317

5079739,4,B007EQR970,"It has a great start but then it starts to wobble and whether or not you will ultimately enjoy it depends on you and your expectations. This film can be considered standard January fare, a nice concept but not grand or high concept enough for a blockbuster. It aims more to entertain than to be a real standout film. I suspected all this going in. Understanding this I was still slightly disappointed that a film that starts out with a consistent, though heightened, reality eventually starts jumping all over the place tonally to facilitate plot twists.

What is good? The directing may not be great as the film has an increasingly unsteady pacing as it goes on, something a director could have controlled, but I fully compliment the cinematography. The shots on the confined ledge feel genuine and fun, they appropriately make the viewer feel slightly uneasy even though you know it's all fine (there is a scene where Worthington fakes the motion of jumping to rile of the crowd, very well done). The heist scenes are suspenseful and well timed. The one shot I didn't enjoy was one where a poorly computer generated camera move goes from the ledge twirling down to the street in an attempt to simulate what a fall might be like, it just looked like outdated CGI of the buildings twirling, not sure why they didn't try and do it practically.

I would also argue that the film is well cast overall:
Sam Worthington is the newer leading man on the scene lately, he is enjoyable if not perfect for the role of a previous New York Police Officer. I enjoyed his acting but his accent shifted between his attempt at an American, to what I sensed as an awkward attempt at a New Yawker, back to his natural Aussie most of the time. Despite the accent issues always in the back of my mind, I enjoyed his performance and he seems to be having fun in the part.
Elizabeth Banks has always been a favorite of mine, I just wish she would get offered some better roles and better lines to deliver. The real flaw with her character is that what starts out as an interestingly developed character with some history and obstacles to overcome suddenly gets lost in a woman who has to immediately jump on board with some crazy ideas losing all the skepticism she had less than a minute before, and with little to no justification.
Jamie Bell is almost always enjoyable and does his best making this part real fun, even if the character is the most underdeveloped. We learn almost nothing about him other than that he is playing Worthington's brother. There is no history, no explanation of how he pulls off the feats he does, no explanation of what compelled him to get involved or why he involved his girlfriend, apparently he does these things just because it's his brother. It is nevertheless fun to watch him play out the situation. Bell and the very attractive, relative newcomer, Genesis Rodriguezhis, who plays his girlfriend, are fun to watch, especially as a team. They actually act somewhat like people who aren't professionals would. They stumble, they drop things, they look anxious and scared. It's a heightened reality for sure but even their out of place lovers quarrels felt fun and in the universe of the film (until the film abandons the universe it established about halfway through).

Another good point is the film is having fun all the way through. Right from the start the film establishes this is a heightened reality where the audience can laugh, so I had no problem at many jokes placed directly in the climax of the film. Early on the crowd make comments that essentially poke fun at the situation and how a desensitized population would deal with it. I laughed aloud when a homeless man started trying to get the crowd to shout Attica! Attica! (an obvious reference to Al Pacino's ad lib in Dog Day Afternoon) but this time no one cheered along and the cops silenced him, hahaha. Still the humor doesn't help when the film starts making unjustified turns too quickly.

What is Bad? I've sort of already said above, the plot builds on what seems to be an interesting premise set in a realistic sort of reality. It then suddenly abandons much of that in order to throw on some unneeded twists and it starts requiring characters to do things that they would never be able to justify, even in the heightened reality established at the beginning of the film. It's like they thought, ""we explained how the characters do things in the beginning, now we can just show the results"". This is in part due to a script that could've used a few more rewrites and some more steady throughlines. It's too bad but I still didn't mind watching it, even though I'd never feel compelled to watch the second half again, I would probably rewatch the beginning and the heist scenes if I scrolled past them on the movie channel. Oh, I don't want to spoil anything for those who might see it for fun, but there is one plot twist regarding a hotel worker that I suspected but hoped against-- unfortunately the hope was in vein. The twist came and was only granted a reveal in the last minute of the film with no actual explanation, which made me wonder why they decided to add it.

Ultimately I really wanted to love this as a January film, I hoped I might even want to buy it as I love the actors and New York. I also had hope for the familiar yet differently approached premise. However the film sort of goes too far out of its own way, becoming more of a parody of the type of thriller it starts out as. I liked the film but it never went past that once the established universe was betrayed. The fun acting and decent cinematography are enough for me to recommend it to those who just want a fun escapism experience (say if you enjoyed Law Abiding Citizen, Tower Heist, etc. this may be one you'll like or even love). I also recommend it to those who like the actors enough to just want to see them having fun, outside of that though I would say don't expect a serious story or any form of consistent tone in the second half. Those who like tonally consistent but heightened films like Dog Day Afternoon, Die Hard or even Panic Room, you will likely be unhappy with this.

I leave it up to each individual, if this doesn't sound like it's for you then there are plenty of other more consistent films in theaters. If it sounds fun to you, give it a chance, it's worth the one viewing at least.

4 stars (really 3.5 leaning closer to 4) from me because I liked watching it, I just wish I could've liked the movie more.",1327622400,,6503,4.519966015293118
5079740,2,B007EQR970,"There are times when you can tell quite a bit of thought went into naming a movie i.e. Inception, Super 8, and 50/50. They're titles that perfectly describe the film you're about to see, but have a bit more meaning after seeing them. While other movies jump straight to the point with their titles, which certainly isn't always a bad thing; look at Drive, Moon, and The Crow. All three movies are better known for the acclaim they've received (from both fans and critics) rather than the amount of money they made at the box office. The title of a movie can go a long way, but in certain circumstances it can sum up an entire movie in a handful of words. Man on a Ledge is a prime example of delivering exactly what you're expecting.

Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is an ex-con who is trying to convince the world that he's an innocent man, but that's a bit difficult when you break out of prison after serving two years on a thirty year sentence. Instead of talking to a lawyer or taking the advice of his former police comrades, Nick steps out onto the ledge of a building. He wants the world to believe he is innocent or else he's going to paint the asphalt with his insides. Little do they know that Nick's suicide attraction is nothing more than a distraction. Across the street, Nick's brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are breaking in to steal the $40 million dollar diamond Nick was convicted of stealing. But time is running out and Nick can only stall for so long as Joey and Angie run into some unexpected surprises that weren't a part of the plan.

Man on a Ledge just becomes more and more awkward as it drags on. It's as if the movie can't decide what type of story it wants to tell. We follow Nick around for a bit in the present day seeing how the first part of the day panned out before he stepped out onto that ledge, but then we jump back three years to understand why he went to prison. The nonlinear sense of storytelling is fine, but it feels a bit out of place when it's used so early on in a film without ever really returning to that format again. Then the pacing becomes a huge issue. Man on a Ledge is very go-go-go the entire movie and it never really gives you enough time to properly process everything or let you really care about these characters. You're aware of the situation, the heist going on next door, the apparent corruption in the police force, and the fact that time is running out right from the start, but it just doesn't really matter. There's no character development as everybody feels so paper thin. Even Sam Worthington can't keep his American accent going the entire movie as his Australian accent seems much more apparent in the second half. It just comes off as a complete mess.

The other problem this crime thriller has is the fact you never really know who to pull for. You've got three people trying to pull off a heist claiming it's to prove one of them is innocent of a crime they went to prison for while an unsolved investigation concerning the police force comes up during Nick's suicide attempt to let them know that somebody on the force has been working for David Englander (played by Ed Harris and who was the main reason Nick went to prison) the entire time. Without much depth to the characters, you never really want to see either side succeed. Through all of Nick's pleading with negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), the wire he's wearing in his ear becomes blatantly obvious. So her shock and surprise to its reveal later on seems more sarcastic than anything. To make matters worse, things stay this way nearly the entire time until the closing moments where every question you have is answered in the last five minutes. Man on a Ledge has some of the worst pacing to ever make it to the screen.

The only real redeemable factor of the movie is Ed Harris, but it's more of his character being so bad and cheesy that he's good. The scene where his character is introduced where he's given a watch by a colleague is hilarious for all of the wrong reasons.

Man on a Ledge is a combination of many movies you've seen before and it feels that way. It's a mishmash of ideas taken from movies like Die Hard, 16 Blocks, and Hostage. Oh wait; maybe it just borrows ideas from Bruce Willis movies. With its ridiculous pacing and even more incongruous ending, Man on a Ledge will invoke you with the urge to use some of that nonlinear storytelling to go back to the beginning of the movie and push Nick off that building yourself to help prevent you from seeing such buffoonery.",1327536000,2,4583,4.464200477326969

Besides having a huge puffed up face (coke & vodka, folks), he is just amazingly short. E. Banks girl cop opposite him is a fly and Sam is just about her size in every shot. Sam's arms appear like Hilary's or Lady Gaga's - about 2 inches too short for his absurdly short statue. When he is seen running along ledge on 30 story building (just another absurd scene) his shrunken arms swing like, honestly, like a midget dwarf.

I am giving him 2 stars, because he was outstanding in ""Avatar"" (now that I think about it, wasn't he a cripple in a wheelchair in that movie?)  So, Dir. James hide his statue.

It really sheds light on the fact that a cop can go from cop to inmate or good cop to bad cop in an instant.  Who can you trust?  This is the
main issue that the story is built around.  It was a real good time!  It was like other movies but not quite.  It had a unique stylistic flair all of its own.",1488672000,,567,3.9646017699115044

5079962,4,B007EQR970,"Guy is in prison for supposedly stealing a diamond from some rich guy. The inmate is a police officer. Anyway he gets to go to a funeral for his dad, gets in a fight with his brother, overpowers the guards, and gets free. He doesn't run away. He actually sets in motion a carefully orchestrated sequence of events to prove he is innocent. And it starts with him appearing on the window ledge of a Manhatten skyscraper.

While I wouldn't say that this was a ""I gotta go tell everyone I know about this awesome movie I saw"" movie. It was entertaining. While break ins etc have been done before, I think, for me, this movie has a pretty overall fresh feel to it. Something kinda new, never been done before. Nothing earth shaking. But pretty fresh.

It was not particularly violent. There were some scenes where people get roughed up. They were not realistic enough to get grossed out by them. I don't recall too much swearing. It was overall a solidly entertaining movie. I watched it without noticing how long it was (not that it was long) as it kept you moving. You were wondering what are they doing? What is the plan? How will it end. Good stuff.

Also the leading actor was what I grew up with men looking and acting like . . . what the leading actor portrayed. They definitely were not anorexic men with t-shirts stretched over their man breasts (what I think pecs are basically). They might have had pecs but they were naturally made not gym made back then. They were not metrosexuals. They were not ugly with tattoos all over them. They were cleaned up short haired nice looking men's men. Not mean. Not trashy. Not a druggie. Not profane. But not a saint. They were good guys. Stand up guys. Guys. This is what this character reminds me of. I guess that was something else I liked about this movie. Don't see that much anymore. I can say that whoever did the art for the DVD cover you see here is about as good a drawer as the guy who drew Brady's court room drawings last week (he doesn't look anything like that guy on the ledge). Anyway this aspect touched me enough to comment on it.",1439942400,7,2094,4.391752577319588

I thought it must be bad since at first glance I thought they had no exceptionally well known actors. Anyway, I was wrong. The movie was paced great, kept me interested and focused from the first minute in. I do not think there was a dull moment in it. It was not ridiculously laden with questionable things. Whoever wrote the script and directed it, etc. made a really good, entertaining movie and the cast was excellent! I really did not know the plot before I sat down to watch it so I was not second guessing anything or trying to really move ahead of the scenes in my mind. I just watched it, enjoyed it and did not feel like it had too bad of sexual things in it or cussing or things like that, I mean it did have SOME but it was just not completely drowned out in things like that. It was all a good balance, a good story and the end may of been a bit more far fetched than the entire rest of the movie in my opinion because it kind of just leaves it as shown- that the main character's things are sort of resolved and then ends. But I have seen way worse movies and my opinion on this was favorable and I would recommend to others to watch it.",1414800000,,1306,4.085603112840467

He orders a nice meal and then calmly steps through the window and stands on the ledge, drawing attention from the crowd below. The police and the press arrive and the jumper specifically asks for Mercer, played by Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket from the ""Hunger Games"" movies) and the intense fun of a very nice action/suspense movie ramps up from there, especially when his identity is revealed. And with a cast like this fleshing out the script, there is much more going on here than a potential suicide. Highly Recommended. Four and a half REVEALING Stars!

If nothing else, the action was brisk.  All  Nick (Sam Worthington) needed was a flying squirrel suit to help guide toward the inflatable mat in the end, but the vengeful cop managed to steer himself successfully to his target.

But of course by putting this character in the film, and the silly, awful banter between them, the director and filmmakers are only proving how unserious they and their film are. Are we supposed to just pause to look at the tits? Then resume w the film? Or are we really to believe she is in on this?

This is like going out to a bar to watch a game and being served by a pretty, buxom, very young bartender. Fine, she's very pretty.

It takes a simple opening premise but, then takes many strengths from Inside Man and The Negociator and turns the movie into multiple factions trying to accomplish their goals, whilst trying to outsmart their main opposition. Also like with Inside Man you find yourself rooting for the person who appears to be the bad guy, but who knows who the REAL bad guy is.

Once the recurring characters were established the movie hooked me and I never got bored. The plot gradually thickened to where, the last third of the movie was far different then how the movie started. There was action, there was clever and intense dialogue, clever tricks preformed during the movie and surprisingly almost everyone got some kind of story arc (minus Edward Burns).

The few gripes I had were, some of the recurring names mentioned after the first hour kept confusing me as to how many major players had yet to reveal themselves to the other ones, Edward Burns's final dialogue somewhat comes out of nowhere as his character didn't really do much and finally I don't understand why the main character allowed the cops to get his prints.

MAN on a LEDGE has the appearance of a pretty standard unlikely sensationalistic adrenaline-thriller. The plot has its share of holes and stretches, and the ending's a bit much. Still, the acting and cinematography are quite good, and the film is immediately arresting, includes a few good surprises, and keeps your attention throughout. An especially fine performance by Elizabeth Banks as police psychologist Lydia Mercer.

MAN on a LEDGE would have been enhanced by more in the way of character development, especially in the relationship(s) between Nick, Joey, and Angie. Also, millionaire con-man David Englander, played by Ed Harris, is a bit too obvious a scumbag from the start.

5080085,2,B007EQR970,"A man checks into a luxury hotel under the name ""Walker."" After an expensive dinner and champagne, he writes a note... and climbs out the window onto a narrow stone ledge.

Welcome to the scenario that opens ""Man on a Ledge,"" which is literally about a man sitting on a ledge to try to prove his innocence. The idea isn't half bad, but the casting of the eternally blank-faced Sam Worthington pretty much deflates the intensity -- the rest of the cast is quite good, but when the plot hinges around a person sitting on a ledge, they better be good.

Two years ago, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) was accused of stealing a massive diamond from wealthy businessman David Englander (Ed Harris), and was sentenced to 25 years. When he's allowed a day out for his father's funeral, Nick escapes from his guards, picks up a cache of money and other supplies, and checks into the hotel. See above description of what happens.

Expecting a suicidal jumper, a massive crowd forms below, while the police try to figure out who Cassidy is and why he's up there. He refuses to talk to anyone except depressed negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks). But unknown to the cops, Nick's younger brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joey's girlfriend Angie (G&eacute;nesis Rodr&iacute;guez) are infiltrating a nearby building, where they plan to prove his innocence -- by stealing the missing diamond.

""Man on a Ledge"" is another one of those movies that might have been simply sublime... if Alfred Hitchcock weren't dead. It has an intriguing idea, and a challenge that most Hollywood movies won't set up for themselves -- what if the hero of the piece barely ever moved from the ledge he's standing on, holding himself hostage in front of all of New York City?

So how does this movie fail? That would be Sam Worthington. This man has the acting ability of a tortoise who just smoked a giant bag of weed -- he never registers any emotions like fear, anxiety, rage or depression. Actually, he barely registers any emotions, period. It's like watching a lifelike robot trying to imitate humans, and failing.

A role like this one needs Christian Bale, Jeremy Renner, (de-aged) Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell or Matt Damon, all of whom could pull off a disgraced cop going to desperate lengths to restore his life. But with Worthington up on the ledge, all feeling of tension is just sucked out of the central storyline. He's not even sweating!

Director Asger Leth actually does a lot better when he's focusing on anything other than the titular man on a ledge -- the infiltration into the vault is a genuinely tense sequence, with some clever twists along the way. However, I found myself a little baffled by the depiction of the people watching Cassidy. For some reason, the crowd of rubberneckers suddenly turns Cassidy into a hero for the common man... even though they don't really know much about what's going on. It feels awkward and is never really explained.

The rest of the actors are pretty decent -- Jamie Bell and Elizabeth Bell give excellent smaller performances, especially since Bell is playing a woman haunted by a failure to talk down a suicidal cop. Ed Harris is something of a cardboard villain though, and Kyra Sedgwick is utterly wasted as an annoying TV reporter who... reports.

The man on a ledge is the weakest point in ""Man on a Ledge"" -- which is a shame, because a strong, talented actor in that role could have made this a wonderfully memorable movie. As it is, it just reminds me of what happens when tortoises get stoned.",1364774400,,3529,4.734527687296417

Man On A Ledge is a film that is all over the place, filled with scenes of unbelievable stupidity. The combination of corruption, theft, ridiculous moves, and lines that sound like their out of a comic book make this movie close to unwatchable. The man on the ledge has an agenda and asks for a beautiful negotiator to talk him down. Even she can see that he's stalling for time, but to what end? It leads to a totally unbelievable story with a horrible ending. I watched this film because I thought it would be different and I love both Elizabeth Banks and Jamie Bell.

5080115,4,B007EQR970,"""Living life too close to the edge
Hoping that I know the ledge..."" - Rakim

(There, I've always wanted to quote the best rapper who ever smoked a mic. So that's one off the bucket list.)

A man on a ledge frequently lacks conviction. A man on a ledge seeks attention, maybe wants a hug. If he were gonna jump, he already would've. Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington), ex-cop and current convict at large, is banking on someone deploying the fuzz and the NYPD negotiator to try to talk him off the ledge. Nick's scheme absolutely hinges on it.

A month ago he was serving out his 25-year sentence at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility. Today, on the corner of 45th & Madison, perched precariously on the narrow ledge off the Roosevelt Hotel's 21st floor, Nick is working on a bit of misdirection. Sent up the river for the theft of a $40 million diamond, he's eyeing the malevolent corporate baron (Ed Harris) what done him wrong, what set him up. Should I mention that this baron's sanctum sanctorum stands within spitting distance of the Roosevelt Hotel? Nick way up there soon collects a massive crowd way down there. Traffic halts, ruckus is raised, fingers point, the vapid news reporter pounces, cell phones record for YouTube posterity. The fuzz rolls up. So does the frazzled negotiator (Elizabeth Banks). The film gets off to a promising start. Up to that point I was all in.

MAN ON A LEDGE delivers an effective sense of vertigo and some nice suspenseful moments. It's better than TOWER HEIST, the most recent I'd seen from this genre. I guess how much you like this film depends on how convincingly it sells you on the series of farfetched events that must fall in place for Nick's plan to work, the first step of which involves his being allowed to attend his father's funeral and from there making a getaway. Most of the film has Nick on that ledge, stalling and stalling and stalling. Eventually, the negotiator and the other fuzz glom on to Nick's delaying tactics. But, by that time, a sort of inertia had already set in.

Nick's scenes would've come across better had the parallel plot thread been more interesting or, more importantly, if the script had been tighter. The second storyline tracks a break-in of a nearby building. Except that the two characters in that narrative seem trapped in a loop of unanticipated mishaps. After a while, it felt like stalling, too. I do like bickering couple Jamie Bell and Genesis Rodriguez. As a bonus, the feisty Rodriguez crawls around in ventilation shafts in a catsuit. I must say that I find the women characters in this film more interesting than their male counterparts. It doesn't hurt that both Banks and Rodriguez are smoking hot. Meanwhile, Sam Worthington's Australian accent slips in occasionally, which is jarring. But give him props for this: That's him on location, out on that ledge high up at the Roosevelt Hotel. Not bad for a guy who goes thru bouts of acrophobia. Overall, I rate MAN ON A LEDGE 3.5 out of 5 stars. It's a perfectly serviceable caper thriller, with some taut nerve-janglers and one final twist at the end. But does Nick Cassidy ever sort out his frame-up about that diamond? I dunno. Maybe he does. Mostly, what's running thru my mind are images of a tough-talking but fragile police psychologist and an amateur break-in artist slinking along in that catsuit. Oh, and Ed Harris is real good as the big bad.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

But from the first moments when the guy opens the window (these windows haven't opened like this for decades) it's beyond fantasy.  Even the true aspects are hard to accept.  They somehow managed to film on a real ledge in midtown Manhattan, with real traffic going by down below.  How they pulled that off in NYC would make another interesting movie.  It's fun if you just go with it because it just gets more and more crazy towards the end.  Pretty much anything you can imagine, happens.",1354147200,2,572,4.5588235294117645

It's not to say I don't at all like a lot of thrillers I see, but many of them are just rehashed ideas.  This particular action thriller was unique and had a fresh new idea behind it.  This movie does contain elements seen in past thriller movies and what have you, but the fact that the main character risks his life to go out onto a ledge in order to draw attention away from the heist taking place and risk his life in order to prove his innocence is something different than what I have seen in most thriller movies.  Is it the most amazing thriller I have ever seen?  No, not quite...but it was still in my opinion a very good one, and the actors all did an excellent job in this.

5080192,3,B007EQR970,"Not to spoil the film's rather convoluted storyline, let me just tell you that ""Man on a Ledge"" is a light-hearted action thriller. Sam Worthington (""Avatar"") is Nick Cassidy, a ""Man on a Ledge"" of Roosevelt Hotel, New York City, threatening to end his life. A former police detective and escaped convict, Nick insists that he will only talk to a police negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks).

In the opening flashback scene it is also shown that Nick, arrested for stealing a 40 million-dollar diamond, has a younger brother Joey (Jamie Bell). Genesis Rodriguez plays Angie, Joey's girlfriend; Anthony Mackie is Mike, a police officer who once worked with Nick; Ed Burns is a cynical police officer Jack; and Ed Harris is the hotel owner David Englander. Kyra Sedgwick and William Sadler also appear as a TV reporter and a valet respectively.

Despite the decent production design of the hotel building, ""Man on a Ledge"" just fails to interest us, revealing its hand too early. The film lacks the tension of ""The Negotiator,"" in which Samuel L. Jackson's character looked really serious about what he is doing. ""Man on a Ledge"" also suffers from an unfocused narrative. For the most part the film's actions take place in more than one place, but none of them is really interesting, due to director Asger Leth's (his feature debut) ineffectively employed cross-cutting storytelling.

""Man on a Ledge"" is a mildly entertaining but forgettable action thriller.",1342915200,,1462,5.033057851239669
5080193,4,B007EQR970,"This was a good movie. Very engaging and certainly not formulaic. The main character was very believable and once one saw his motives for being on the ledge it was like OMG, this WILL be interesting.",1342915200,,199,4.555555555555555
5080194,4,B007EQR970,"This thriller tale has some things going for it but sometimes connecting the various plot elements feels a bit off. That said, it's still good even if not great. I appreciated one particular twist in the last quarter of the picture.

Story focuses upon a man, who turns out to be an ex cop who claims he's innocent, who is on a ledge planning to kill himself and draws the police and a big crowd.

Starring Sam Worthington, Ed Harris, Elizabeth Banks, Edward Burns and Jamie Bell.

5080198,5,B007EQR970,"""Man on a Ledge"" shows that not all thrillers these days have to center solely around explosions and lots and lots of gunfire and fast cars.  I guess you could call this an intelligent thriller.

Sam Worthington (Avatar) plays a police officer convicted and imprisoned for stealing a huge diamond and then cutting it down and selling it bit by bit.  Ed Harris (The Abyss, Enemy at the Gate, etc., etc.) is a mega-wealthy NYC real estate tycoon who lost the diamond.

One thing leads to another and you'll have to see how this all happens, but Sam Worthington's character, with nothing to lose, checks into a 20+ story hotel where he steps out onto a ledge, apparently to commit suicide.  Elizabeth Banks, a down and out police negotiator, comes in to try to talk him down.

I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised and completely engaged as the plot lines twisted and turned in unexpected ways.  This is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed watching.  I watched it with my wife and our 18-yr old son.  It appealed to each of us.

The acting was good, the story line was outstanding, and the whole package is worth watching again.

I was going to award this movie 4 solid stars, but as I read what I wrote I realized that I ended up liking it 5-stars' worth.

The guy escapes from 2 guards sent to watch over him at a funeral he is allowed to go to and, as if that isn't unbelievable enough, he then takes their car, gets hit by a train and jumps over an 8 foot chain link fence to finish the get away.

5080219,4,B007EQR970,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Man On A Ledge starts with Nick Cassidy, played by Sam Worthington, checking into a hotel and walking out onto the ledge of his room's window. I thought this was a very odd way to start the movie, I felt like they just jumped to something I thought was going to be a major scene, but as the movie went on it was clear this was the best place to put this scene. After he gets on the ledge there's a flashback of his father's funeral, and his escape from prison. So we learn he's an escaped convict, but we don't know why he was convicted. As the movie goes on we learn he's trying to prove that not only is he innocent, but he was set up.

As the movie progressed the writing seemed to go back and forth between good and stale. There were some really well written scenes, but then you had some that were really unbelievable. The dialogue, for the most part, I felt was well written and, at some parts, very clever. Especially when he was having to talk to Joey (Jamie Bell) and Angela (Gnesis Rodrguez) at the same time he was talking to Lydia (Elizabeth Banks) I felt that whole scene was extremely well done.

Going into the movie I had no real idea what the story was about. Obviously you had a man on the ledge, and from the trailer it looked like a man trying to prove his innocence, but that's all you really know. Which is why I was so surprised at how much I actually enjoyed it. Sometimes knowing as little as possible while going into a movie makes it that much better. The same thing happened when I watched ""Safe House"" recently. I had no idea what it was about, and I loved it.

Finally, I don't know who Gnesis Rodrguez is, but oh my god is she sexy. She has a scene where she's changing and you see her standing in her undergarments and she has a body that will make your jaw drop. I'll definitely be on the lookout for more of her in the future.

Overall Score: 7/10 - What we have here is a good movie with some good acting. The writing can be a little stale at times, and some scenes can be unbelievable, but what we're left with is an enjoyable suspense film held together by an excellent score from Henry Jackman.",1340323200,,2183,4.2254196642685855

This is a fast moving action movie with some pretty good young actors and actresses in it.  I enjoyed watching it and the story line sort of follows a Mission Impossible style action theme.  Police officer Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) and Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) do an excellent job acting their roles in the movie and they are not bad to look at either.  This movie has enough action, plot and interesting characters to keep you absorbed in it and enjoying it.

I liked the concept, it was a fresh spin on the Oceans 11 type movies that have been done over and over so that was a nice change, but mix in a bit of bad acting, some scenes that just were not nearly as impressive as they could have been and you wind up with a movie that is good to watch when there isn't anything else on.

Halfway thru the movie I was kind of hoping the man on the ledge would fall off the ledge and put an end to my boredom. The movie preview was sooooo much better than the movie.

I suppose that speaks extra for the cast and the director: it's one thing to make you intrigued when you don't know what's going to happen; it's an entirely different feat to make you care when you already know.

5080226,3,B007EQR970,"Sam Worthington plays an ex-cop imprisoned for stealing a large diamond from one of the cities wealthy developers (Ed Harris).  Nick (Worthington) is not guilty of course.  Released to go to his dad's funeral, he manages to escape with the help of his brother (Jamie Bell) and brother's girlfriend (Genesis Rodriguez).

With the intricately orchestrated precision of a Navy Seal team, Nick traverses the ledge of a New York skyscraper, threatening to jump while Joey (Bell) and Angie (Rodriguez) break into a nearby building that contains the offices of Englander (Harris).  Nick believes that Englander not only framed him but still has the diamond and controls a couple cops on the payroll.  There are only 4 cops prominent in the film so you have a 50/50 chance of figuring out who the dirty ones are even if you're not paying attention.

The movie boils down to a pretty standard heist movie without the humor.  Elizabeth Banks tries to liven things up as the cop who tries to talk Nick off the ledge and with their byplay it's pretty easy to see where that relationship will ultimately end up.  The movie isn't terrible but isn't anything special either.  It may be worth seeing if for no other reason than watching Ms. Rodriguez squeeze into a rubberized leotard.

The Blu ray transfer is excellent.  Projected in 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the contrast and color are sharp and clear.  The buildings of Manhattan look good but with a bit of shimmer noticeable.  The audio is excellent as well but mostly contained inside buildings or with some exterior traffic noise.

5080237,3,B007EQR970,"This movie had real potential.  A quick look at the cast members tells you that this must have started with a half-decent script.  Elizabeth Banks, Ed Harris, Ed Burns...all excellent.  I was also excited to see Sam Worthington, who I found excellent in Avatar and Terminator Salvation.

The story follows Nick Cassidy (Worthington), who is an ex-cop convicted of stealing a very precious stone from a rich developer (Harris).  Cassidy attempts to clear his name by climbing out onto the ledge of a hotel in New York in the middle of the day.  This, however, is just a distraction so that his brother (played by the ever-adorable Jamie Bell, aka ""Billy Elliot"") can break into the developer's vault to find the missing stone.  The negotiator (Banks) tries to talk Cassidy off the ledge but soon realizes that something else is going on.

I thought this was a fun movie but it was missing something.  Worthington just isn't the dynamic lead man that I expected.  And although the story was really good, there are a few unrealistic stunts that distract (I usually don't mind this in an action movie but it seemed random in this movie, which is less action and more mystery).

Finally, I took off an extra star for Sam Worthington's lack of ability to maintain an American accent (I would have granted the movie 4-stars otherwise).  I don't remember him having trouble with his accent in other movies, but it was very apparent in this movie.  He really struggled and it was extremely distracting.",1339113600,,1493,4.78515625
5080238,1,B007EQR970,"First alert to a clich written movie is the use of a prolonged opening scene of a helicopter overhead view of cars and buildings below (unless it's in the country then it's trees and a winding road). Clich continues with another crime thriller that has lots of stereotypes and portrayals that lack believability. Bad guy businessman looks like bad guy - mafia style (Shouldn't they really just look like ordinary bankers and financial advisors?); cops look and talk like Hollywood cops including the obligatory attractive female cop and African-American cop as a counterpoint to dumb partners. Poorly written and fragmented storyline of a double crossed cop looking to prove his innocence. The unbelievable parts come in droves of scenes starting with that cop and his highly unlikely planned escape from prison during a funeral then, despite not wearing a seat belt, the car he escapes in is demolished by a train and he just runs away with no marks, not even on his clothing. His co-conspirators who could have spent their lives as department store sales people end up having an arsenal of special ops equipment which allows them to break into a bank like professional cat buglers and steal a $40 million dollar diamond. The usual disarming of security cameras and motion sensors; manipulating codes; accessing electrical circuits and crawling through ceiling access spaces. How repetitively redundant, if not stolen, from countless other movies with the same hooks. The escaped cop makes himself a suicide decoy to the heist that is taking place next door and then somehow escapes from the dozen cops that surround him. Even the watching crowd and reporter scenes seemed predictably clichd. This script would make a good cartoon fantasy.",1339027200,13,1740,5.108771929824561

5080247,5,B007EQR970,"Starting with a tightly woven story and screenplay by Pablo F. Fenjves and directed with an eye and an ear on tension by Asger Leth MAN ON A LEDGE provides on of the best suspense/caper heist/intrigue/good cop-bad cop movies to come out in a long time. The pacing of this remarkable story is such that it speeds by so quickly that the audience feels like the movie is very short - and that is even with the fact that there is a history of the main character shared in flashbacks, and an upfront suspenseful tale out in the open with a simultaneous heist going sub rosa.  No one is who they seem to be on the surface and as the story unwinds we are able to discover a very deeply embedded history of a man on a ledge.

Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington at his best) checks into the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, orders a champagne breakfast and then steps out on the very high ledge to begin the tale. A screaming woman from the street spies him and police surround the hotel, providing a trampoline for the victim to jump to safety. But Nick demands from the cop assigned (Edward Burns) that a particular negotiator be assigned to talk with him - that negotiator is boozily disgraced Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks). Mercer takes charge, identifies with Cassidy's plight and forces her fellow policemen to leave the situation to her.  Meanwhile we discover Cassidy's brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are in the building across the street, breaking in and performing an incredible heist for a 40 carat diamond owned by criminally minded David Englander (Ed Harris): flashbacks reveal that Cassidy had been imprisoned as a bad cop who allegedly stole that diamond and has escaped form prison to prove his innocence. The action goes back and forth between Cassidy and Mercer in their talks and Joey and Angie and their progress and Englander and the dirty cops assisting him, Gradually the true colors of all the people are revealed in a fine, startling way.

The cast is exceptionally fine, with smaller roles being ably played by Anthony Mackie, Kyra Sedgwick, Pooja Kumar, William Sadler, Titus Welliver and others. For once a film is a true suspense story that keeps the audience riveted to their seats. The top notch cinematography is by Paul Cameron an the musical score is by Henry Jackman.  From top to bottom this is a fine ensemble production.  May 12",1338336000,,2395,4.7040572792362765

I thought to myself, ""Wow, what a stupid title. Hollywood has really gone down, but it does actually look like a pretty good movie."" So anyways I went to see it the first weekend. Surprisingly this stupid titled movie, was very entertaining. Sam worthington is very good and convincing as a man that will do anything to prove his innocence, after he was convicted of robbing Ed Harris of his prized diamond. What we get in return is an action packed roller coaster ride of false accusations, stealth attacks, and happy family reunions. Now you can obviously predict that there are a lot of plot holes. Like when Sam worthington escapes from prison, he is not exactly immediately chased, but is just kind of slowly followed. But anyway, this is a stellar movie, that you probably don't remember because it was really only out in theatres for what seemed liked two weeks. That's of course just an exaggeration, but no one saw this movie. Probably a little bit more thinking could've gone into the title to make it a little more appealing, but what this title really doesn't tell you is that this an exciting action movie, not just a movie about a loners attempt at suicide.

Not only are you on the edge of your seat wondering what Nick will do, but there is also a diamond heist going on at the same time that keeps you holding your breath. For this type of movie the cast isn't really all that amazing, but this is an exception. The cast is super in this and that actually adds to the enjoyment and gives the movie a more serious feel. This is a movie that keeps you guessing all the way through and is full of excitement. There were a few over-the-top scenes that made me laugh, but the movie was good enough to overcome those parts.
