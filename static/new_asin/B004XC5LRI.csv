4493996,1,B004XC5LRI,"If the point of this movie is to display how life was once a bit messy then in every redundant grimy bloody detail it succeeded. The actors, dirt, blood & Vodka, etc. were continually well played to the point of being overly used and eventually tiresome. Is there some sense of historical record? Yes, I suppose, but who's to say after 500 years with few first hand accounts. Even Gogol rewrote the Bulba novelette, two hundred years after the portrayed events, in the mid 1800s to appease Russian sentimentality.

One star because the entire production from writing, to directing to editing is an affront to any viewer who succeeded in passing the 11th grade (graduation not required). If there ever was a modality to showcase nationalism, particularly with religious underpinnings, then this movie did so but contrary to it's intent the result is a sense of disgust. Did the producers really think their audience would be so naive or did they care?",1312502400,5,950,4.864197530864198
4493997,4,B004XC5LRI,"""May they all know what brotherhood means on Russian soil."" The true account of Taras Bulba (Stupka), a Ukraine Cossack who helped to defend his homeland from the Poles in the 16th century. This is one of the best foreign movies that I have seen. The movie opens with a ""Braveheart"" like speech, then we flash back to what got him in that position. The movie then begins to take shape and tries to cover every conceivable aspect it can. Love story, fighting, father/son tension, and the quest for freedom. Much like as in ""Saving Private Ryan"" the movie is bookended by very intense fighting scenes. This is another movie that is not meant for queasy viewers. The torture scene toward the end makes the ""Braveheart"" one seem tame. There is so much in this movie and I could go on and on about the aspects of why I liked it, but it's best to just watch it and see for yourself. Very, very well done. Overall, a fantastic foreign movie that has some of the most intense battle scenes I have seen in a long time. I give it an A-.

Would I watch again? - I might, but not for awhile.

4493998,5,B004XC5LRI,"The five stars are for the film itself.  Some reviewers have contended that it is only Russian nationalistic propaganda, but I strongly disagree.  The film is a true representation of the short story by Nikolai Gogol, which is, indeed, nationalistic Russian literature at its rousing finest.  Bogdan Stupka is outstanding as Taras Bulba, and the rest of the cast members are sterling, as well.  I just wonder what the hell Entertainment One is doing by giving us yet another regular DVD of a film we bought a year and a half ago from Amazon as a CP Digital product.  This version was titled (correctly) TARAS BULBA and had a nice image and good English sub-titles.  An official blu-ray of TARAS BULBA was sold in Russia without an English translation back in 2009.  Now, Entertainment One is re-releasing it and calling it THE CONQUEROR.  Oddly, Amazon France will carry a re-release of the same film called THE BARBARIAN pressed by Condor Entertainment.  And, there will be a blu-ray available of it (sadly, with only French and Russian options).  What are we in America?  Chopped liver?  Doesn't Entertainment One realize just how many on us have ""gone blu-ray""?  Do they think we will buy something we already own just because they give it a new title?  Please, Entertainment One, come on into the 21st Century, the water's fine.  Just give us a blu-ray option for this wonderful film.  It's a colorful wide-screen epic that will be look so much better in HD.  You look antiquated and insulting to your audience by not doing it.",1310083200,5,1531,4.782442748091603

4494015,5,B004XC5LRI,"This movie is much more faithful to Gogol's short story than the old Hollywood movie ""Taras Bulba"" with Yul Brynner and Tony Curtis.  Rather than being a romance like the original movie, The Conqueror is more a patriotic story, as Gogol depicted.  The movie portrays the ostensible mindset of the traditional Russian, with a modern elaboration that is familiar to the European.  In the movie, Taras Bulba is the type of person one would call a 'Euro Guy,' macho and tough in the style of that part of the globe (think of actors like Jason Statham).  Andriy Bulba is depicted as a Europe-looking Russian, and his Polish girlfriend is depicted not so much as a love interest, but as a Jezebel; the symbolism is clear - Russia is distinct from Europe and that flirtation with such will corrupt the country.  The movie also presents Yankel, who was absent in the Hollywood version, but played a significant role in Gogol's story; the plot here was faithful to the original story.

The Conqueror would clearly appeal to the Russian patriot.  But it is a story that Americans can relate to as well.",1432944000,16,1092,4.71578947368421

If someone thinks that this is Russian propaganda, send your claim to the Ukrainian writer Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852), author of the novel ""Taras Bulba,"" a movie quotes verbatim dialogues and monologues Gogol's heroes.

4494027,1,B004XC5LRI,"Yet another attempt by Russians to tie their history into that of Ukraine.
First, no Kozak of Taras Bul'ba era would ever utter the word 'Russia'(the term didn't even exist at that time:present day Russia was known then simply as 'Mouscovy').
Second, Kozaks (or Cossaks) was a purely Ukrainian phenomenon , born of and intrinsically woven  into the Ukrainian ethnos, and as such had absolutely nothing to do with Russia.
 So, the frequency,with which the makers of this film inserted the word ''Russia"" into the speeches of the main characters, made me feel,like  I was to memorize and remember, that those Kozaks were fighting  for their motherland ""Russia"",rather than Ukraine. The fact that Russia has been writing the history of Ukraine as something of its own is,of course,nothing new. Yet each time I face  such a flagrant historical,(cultural,etc.) plagiarism on the part of Russia makes me sick to the stomach. And the only ""conquest"" this film makes me think of, is that ever insatiable agresion of Russian imperialistic  ego.
 As to what motivated B.Stupka to accept the main role in this ""chef- d'oeuvre"" is a mystery to me- I used to have a better opinion of him.",1387843200,5,1175,4.934010152284264

4494031,3,B004XC5LRI,"The Conqueror aka Taras Bulba is a Russian film based on the short novel written by Nikolai Gogol in 1835. The film was directed by Vladimir Bortko and was released in 2009.

In the 17th century in the eastern borderlands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a Zaporozhian Cossack leader, Taras Bulba (Bohdan Stupka), sends his two sons to the Polish city of Kiev for a formal education where one of them, Andriy (Igor Petrenko), falls for a gorgeous Polish maiden, Elzhbeta (Magdalena Mielcarz). The sons return home and join their father on a trip to the Zaporozhian sich (capital) intent on drinking, carousing, and other manly activities. Their desire for battle is granted when it's revealed the Polish overlords destroyed Bulba's village and murdered his wife in his absence. The Cossacks commence a war of independence from the Poles and lay siege to the Polish city of Dubno. When Andriy learns his Polish damsel is starving inside the city he abandons his father and comrades to be with her and assist the Poles. In the midst of battle, Bulba kills his son for treachery. His loyal son, Ostap, is captured by the Poles and taken to Warsaw where Bulba witnesses his grizzly death. The Cossack continues his crusade against the Poles but is finally captured and burnt at the stake.

This movie has its good points. Stupka does a decent job as Bulba although he seems to be far too old to be leading battle charges. Polish actress and model, Magdalena Mielcarz, is an absolutely gorgeous woman and a feast for the eyes. Is that famous Polish actor Daniel Olbrychski portraying Krasnevsky? Yes it is. The sets and costumes are very well done. However, the overt Russian nationalism which appears in many scenes is way over the top. The movie was partly financed by the Russian Ministry of Culture which explains the ripe chauvinism. The close-ups of every blood-gurgling sword wound are extremely overdone. Close-ups of Bulba bobbing up and down while he's supposedly riding a horse belong to a long-gone era of filmmaking. There is very little sympathy for Andriy. His decision to abandon his family, comrades, and homeland for a gorgeous Polish peach comes across as far too brash. A lot more character development was needed.

Ukrainians objected to this film because it portrays them as ""Russians,"" however this was also Gogol's viewpoint as anyone who has read the book is familiar. This topic of Russian hegemony versus Ukrainian autonomy was and is a very real social and political issue.

During the Cossack Uprisings of the 17th century approximately 100,000 Jews were massacred. Jews often acted as middlemen and landlords for the Polish magnates and were deeply resented by the Ukrainian peasants. This movie does show the Cossacks initially attacking the Jews but merciful Bulba puts a stop to it

There are many moments in the film where the Orthodox Cossacks indicate their fight with the Papist Poles is a religious crusade.

The Conqueror is definitely worth a look but the nationalistic cheerleading and antediluvian special effects are major minuses. Three stars to The Conqueror but five stars to gorgeous Baltic blonde, Magdalena Mielcarz.

For the Hollywood version of Taras Bulba see the 1962 film directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Yul Brynner and Tony Curtis. It's full of Hollywood schlock but still entertains. At least in that version the attraction between Andrei (Curtis) and the Polish maiden (named Natalia in that film, played by lovely Christine Kauffman) is developed to the point where we understand how Andrei could have betrayed his father. 38-year-old Curtis divorced Janet Leigh so he could marry his nubile, 17-year-old co-star.

For the Polish take on the Cossack Uprisings you'll want to see With Fire and Sword (1999) starring drop-dead-gorgeous Polish actess, Izabella Scorupco. Stupka had a role in this film as the infamous Zaporozhian Hetman, Bohdan Chmielnicki.",1346457600,3,3922,5.069767441860465
4494032,3,B004XC5LRI,"This is more violent,and sub-titled. The hollywood version with Yul Brenner and Tony Curtis is better and focuses more on the love story. I prefered the Yul Brenner, Tony Curtis version.",1322438400,2,186,5.032258064516129
4494033,3,B004XC5LRI,"The original Zaphorzian Cossacks of the Sich were Polish & Ruthenian (Ukranian) military & civilian settlers who were established in military settlements (forts if you lie) along the frontier. 'Ukrania' basically means 'Frontier' in old Polish & Ruthenian. They were established by the Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwelth to protect the frontier from Russians, & Muslim Crimean (Krim) Tartars (Tatars) who were subjects of the Ottoman Turks with whom the Commonwealth fought at least 3 major wars with & the Commonwealth won 2 of those wars. The myth of Bohdan (various spellings) the NOBLE (priveleged class) Cossack Colonel of a Registered Cossack Cavalry Regiment being a commoner is another myth that was used by the later day Bolsheviks.

For a more  entertaining and 'non-Russian propagandic' film version of Nikolai Gogol (Mykola Hohol, in Ukrainian) novella, buy or rent Taras Bulba, starring Yul Brynner, Tony Curtis, Christine Kaufmann, etc. I gave this one star for Stupka's acting and the colorful kozak outfits. Besides the propagandic issue, it's surprising that the fight scenes in this big budget film shot in 2009 are so uncinematically klunky.

This movie is very simplistic and although interesting at times you will find yourself asking the question am I really still watching this.

If you want a movie depicting a Russian / Poland conflict buy the movie ""1612"". It is light years ahead of this movie in quality.

Bottom line is if you like period pieces with large scale battle scenes and war this movie is way down the list of must sees and will leave you wanting more out of the movie.",1318118400,19,654,4.25
4494038,3,B004XC5LRI,"This film is based on the book by Nikolai Gogol, and as such has stuck to the patriotic theme that he adopted for reasons of conformity at the time. That being said I decided to judge it as a film in its' own right. It tells the story of the legendary Taras Bulba who, in the 16th Century took on the enemies of the Cossacks with his two sons.

They, his sons,  were first sent to be trained by the monks and returned as men, but not Cossacks so he takes them off to the Cossack `finishing school', where he discovers that a shameful truce has been signed by the `ataman' a spiritual and de facto leader, with the Sultan (his enemy). Taras then orchestrates an embarrassing show down to get him removed and replaced by someone with more war like tendencies. Just as he has the mob whipped up into a frenzy of Islamophobia, some of his comrades turn up with news that all of his men, livestock and family have been murdered by the invading Poles, who are in collusion with the Tartars, Roman Catholics and worst of all Jews. So we have a smorgasbord of hatred and retribution brewing up. First thing is a Jewish pogrom, but Taras intervenes, and then takes them all to fight the Poles.

His youngest son has also fallen for the daughter Elizabeta, of the Tartars -she looks a bit like Britney Spears (with hair that is). She is with her father who is sheltering with the Polish garrison. What follows is a tale of Shakespearian tragedy. Taras faces one battle after another. Speaking of which, there are lots of battles and the siege scenes are excellent, with little or no CGI as far as I could tell. There is masses of gore and proper hand to hand fighting. Bogdan Stupka as Bulba is a tour de force, but director Vladimir Bortko manages to illicit strong performances from all those concernd. There is a big however, and that is when they come to some of their `am dram' deaths and start wailing on about how great Mother Russia is, before finally expiring. One would have been tolerable but after the third it gets to be a bit wearisome, and not in the slightest bit believable. That is the movies downfall it has sacrificed cod propaganda and sentimentality for even a veneer of authenticity.

It is in Russian and Polish with English sub titles, when they speak Polish it is translated verbatim into Russian! Still I did ruddy well enjoy this film and as it is over two hours long, that has done well to keep my attention, the costumes are excellent, the music is great and the cast of thousands was very much appreciated, but I have to judge on the whole package, so not quite a four star offering, but very close indeed.",1316304000,5,2627,4.443983402489627

First This movie is filled with so much Russian and even Soviet propaganda its laughable!! This movie makes it seem like they yearn to throw off the yoke of the Poles and embrace the yoke of the Russians, like they loved the little brother (subservient) relationship that Ukraine had for so long in the modern period under Soviet and Russian rule. If they did why all the Revolutions?? Secondly He kills his son for marrying the Polish girl and becoming Catholic!!! What kind of father could do such a thing? You lose what little sympathy you have for the character of Taras Bulba in that instance. In the end I half cheered when Bulba gets burned alive by the Poles but then cringed as he spews out Propaganda about resisting the Poles and joining the Russians even as he burns.
