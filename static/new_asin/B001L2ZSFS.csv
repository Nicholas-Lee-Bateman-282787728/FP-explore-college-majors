3678197,1,B001L2ZSFS,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was a waste of $3. The movie trailer is very misleading. I give it 3 thumbs down...,1246665600,,134,3.8214285714285716
3678198,5,B001L2ZSFS,"I mostly watched Stiletto for Stana Katic(Castle) as she's an absolutely thrilling actress and she's just wonderful to watch.
At first watch I was lightly appalled by the large amount of bloody, gore-ish, violence, but I quickly grew to love it. It has a interesting plotline, murders within a gang with a killer who doesn't mind leaving behind her perfectly shaped tracks. And I mean how many people kill with a gorgeous, bejeweled stiletto now a days? So Raina is out killing members of a gang. Why? Who freaking knows. But she does it so well that even though they know who it is(well one of the cops anyways), she remains effectively out of their grasp.
Stana portrays heartbreak and fury perfectly. And the rest of the cast does exceptionally well too. The crazy girlfriend who really just has relationship issues that she wants to fix is violent as hell. Her boyfriend is a maniacal gang killer. And their gang boss is in love with her. A perfect watch when you're really in the mood for a good action flick.",1243382400,37,1014,4.638888888888889
3678199,3,B001L2ZSFS,"For everything that Stiletto does well, it's been done plenty of times before.  Despite that though, Stiletto is a fairly entertaining revenge flick that boasts an impressive enough cast that helps propel the film.  Stana Katic (TV's Castle) stars as Raina; a femme fatale out for revenge against her former gangster boss lover Virgil (Tom Berenger), who himself is looking to find her after her attempt on his life.  Also in tow is the crooked cop (Paul Sloan, who also wrote the film) assigned after Raina, Virgil's sadistic muscleman (Michael Biehn), and Virgil's greedy cousin (William Forsythe).  Fairly bloody and equally convoluted in its story, Stiletto delivers the goods that thriller fans are generally looking for, and seeing old pros like Berenger, Forsythe, and Biehn (who gives the best performance he's done in quite some time) make it worth seeing.  Also featuring smaller parts from Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Kelly Hu, Dominique Swain, and D.B. Sweeney.",1236902400,4,973,5.211538461538462
3678200,5,B001L2ZSFS,"As the other reviewers have mentioned: STILETTO does not lack talent. Michael Biehn, Tom Sizemore, Tom Berenger  and William Forsyhte co-star along with Stana Katic. I was pleasantly surprised with this film. Plenty of twists and turns coupled with hard-hitting violence kept me extremely entertained. The performances are all top-notch...Michael Biehn plays a real psycho and the actress that plays his girlfriend is someone to watch. This is not your run-in-the-mill action movie. Instead, STILETTO is a hard-boiled tale of love and vengeance. Set on the gritty streets of Los Angeles, Katic plays Raina, a sexy femme fatale seeking revenge on the rapidly deteriorating crime family responsible for her sister's disappearance. Berenger plays a overly sensitive, yet hyper violent mob boss. Berenger's over-the-top offering is one of the many fun performances of the movie. Do yourself a favor and check it out. STILETTO is a stylish thriller filled with revenge, murder, and mystery set in a world permeated by violence and corruption. Instant classic.",1236038400,4,1054,5.426829268292683
3678201,2,B001L2ZSFS,"I could not pass up the chance to see this many fallen from the top (1980s/90s) list actors all in one film: Biehn, Sizemore, Forsythe, Berringer, DB Sweeney, and the awesome Tony Lip.

We have an LA story of fighting drug lords, white supremacists, Russian immigrants, drug users and a crooked cop mixing it all up. I will try and be fair in preface: I was slightly entertained at times, but the laundry list of reasons to not watch this could fill a dry cleaner's storage. The film stock looked good, the sound was fine, but the story makes for a typical B/C movie hit list. Admittedly, the personal flashbacks while watching this are unavoidable: watching Biehn go crazy with a shotgun (Terminator), Forsythe's accent (American Me), Berrenger eating high-end food in a $5000 suit (right out of Training Day), Sizemore looking absolutely hammered (can't narrow that down), etc.

The violence is gratuitous as our heroine uses a 12"" retractable blade to slice and dice her revenge spree that plots the film. Kelly Hu's role was short lived, as was Tony Lip only having two lines at the end, resulting in some of my supporting favorites having little action. Technically, the over-acting detracted from the main theme of being low key, the make-up on Berrenger was put on with a shovel, and the amount of ""would never happen"" moments are overwhelming. But, it will appeal to a few looking for that action, serial killer, SoCal blood piece. Otherwise, a skipper.",1235952000,5,1461,4.84

3678230,2,B001L2ZSFS,"I'm a big Stana Katic fan but, honestly, she is wasted in this ""B"" level ""thriller"" about shady dealings and revenge.
The truth is that Katic, an unconventional beauty who can move with such fluid grace, has shown through several seasons of ""Castle"" that she is capable of some really fine acting. Apparently, however, the director and producers of this disjointed flick never saw her on television because they give her no real chance to show off the range of her acting skills, choosing instead to put her in leather and high heels and send her on a mission that would be silly if it wasn't so badly written.
If you have nothing better to watch on a lonely Friday night, by all means waste a little time watching ""Stiletto"" because at least you get to see a rare beauty in spiky heels, leather and a black bra... if, however, you have anything else to do, and by that I include taking a nap, then give this a pass.",1415404800,,916,4.42603550295858

Story line took a slight turn near the end that we did not see, so it wasn't all cliche.  Nice film to watch on Sunday afternoon with some popcorn.  Would recommend to Stana / CASTLE fans.",1398643200,,313,4.15

3678243,1,B001L2ZSFS,"The artwork cover says, cool film with a narrative that has a twist with excellent editing and fine cinematography with a witty dialog but the film has none of that. I have tried to watch this film a dozen times and it has nothing but disappointment. It is sad, really sad to know that there are film makers who will never be able to reach us with possible masterpieces, film makers who want to educate the viewer with their politics, filmmakers who could scare the crap out of us and film makers who try to entertain us but can't because of finances which is why I purchased this film. It would take a thousand lifetimes to view every film that was ever made not considering the 90% of films made before 1950 that are ""lost films""-(films that were used for the silver nitrate) i.e (""The Original 1925 ""Gentlemen Prefer Blonds"") and to think that I made an effort, a really serious effort to find the enjoyment in this film but this film has none, it was slapped together without any effort or the budget went to the wrong department, It just sucks, it seriously sucks!",1390953600,,1069,4.487179487179487
3678244,4,B001L2ZSFS,I gave it 4 stars because I am a huge stanatic fan. Love her in everything she's in. She puts her heart & soul into her work & it shows in this film. Shes a bad a$$  in this film. Love her dark stares & her sexy voice. BUT other than that it is a tad bit hard to follow until her character explains what's going on in the middle of the movie. The male actors (if that's what you call them) were trying to act bad a$$ but failed miserably.  She needed to take those clowns out.  Good film if you are a stana fan otherwise its kinda blah.,1386201600,5,536,3.8545454545454545

3678246,2,B001L2ZSFS,Stana Catic is one of my favorites but this film was way before her nose job and Castle. Stick with Castle and you'll enjoy her work more.,1376006400,,138,4.148148148148148
3678247,4,B001L2ZSFS,Seamy and dark with a not insignificant amount of violence.  All hierarchial societies must have a regulatory code (a code of honor as it were) which they must respect and inforce if they are to maintain discipline and focus.

3678248,3,B001L2ZSFS,"I'll be honest with you the only reason i'm giving this 3 stars is I really like Stana Katic and she has the major role in this movie.

It stars Tom Berenger, Michael Biehn, William Forsythe, James Russo, D.B. Sweeney and Tom Sizemore.  To be honest with you i can't figure out how this movie attracted this level of actors.  This is barely a ""B"" movie.",1374796800,,494,4.268817204301075
3678249,4,B001L2ZSFS,"Stana Katic as a knife-wielding killer was a surprise.  Her accents, as always, were spot-on.  Initially the f-bomb was spouted so much by the men in the movie that I decided eliminating them would have brought the script to her lines and 1/2 page for all the men combined!
Lots of darkness and an ending that leaves the viewer with the opportunity to decide who was left standing.
Mostly I was amused by the cover since Stana does not use guns nor does she dress so revealingly.  Made me wonder if the film's creators thought it wasn't good enough to attract viewers on its own merits.",1373760000,3,586,4.509433962264151

This is an obvious take off of Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"", which is a much better movie. Frankly, it needs much better editing.

Conclusion:  If you want to see a good movie of this type, watch ""Kill Bill"".  If you want to find out the skill of Stana Katic, definitely watch this movie.  If you want to see how a group of actors (all female in this case) can save a bad movie, watch this.

3678266,1,B001L2ZSFS,"It's hard to believe that such a talented cast could make such a terrible picture. After all, it has Oscar nominated Tom Berenger (""Platoon""), the marvelous Michael Biehn (""Tombstone"", ""Terminator"", ""Aliens""), William Forsythe (""Out for Justice"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Things to do in Denver when you're dead""), and hit TV series sexy cop Stana Katic (""Castle""). And in smaller roles there are Golden Globe nominees Diane Venora (""Bird"") and Tom Sizemore (""Witness Protection""), James Russo, D.B. Sweeney, Amanda Brooks, and Kelly Hu, to name just a few. But, with the exception of Biehn, Brooks, and Hu, the performances run from weak to worse.

But bad acting doesn't come easily. It requires a moronic script which co-star Paul Sloan provides, and thankfully he seems to have given up screen writing to concentrate on acting, which he is very good at. Combine a bad script with equally bad editing, and not even the good photography and music can save this bomb.

3678270,3,B001L2ZSFS,"This movie suffers from two problems:  the cast is too big and unless you read the product description you won't know why Stana Katic (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castle-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B001XRLWPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castle: The Complete First Season</a>) is carving up people with an edged weapon too big to be a knife and too small to be a sword.

In a movie this short, you have the first act to introduce to the audience the protagonist, the antagonist and the world they live in; anything else just bogs down the story.  And in a revenge movie, you have to know why the protagonist is doing what she does or she just becomes some psychotic killer.

What saves this movie is a nice twist at the end and the character of a cop working for the mob.  I honestly didn't see the twist--and that's saying something, believe me--and that there is more to the cop; he may work for the mob, but he is definitely not dirty.

All in all, probably not worth the price of a rental, let alone a purchase, but I will keep an eye on the writer as he shows some potential.

NOTE TO THE PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT:  If you've got a movie named ""Stiletto"" and the cover is going to feature an armed woman, she should probably be holding the titled weapon rather than a pair of guns.",1262995200,,1323,4.848888888888889
3678271,3,B001L2ZSFS,"A gritty tale of revenge and greed, Stiletto (2008) hits hard from the start with a series of fast-paced bloody kills, and almost never lets up.  Stana Katic (TV series Castle) heads the ensemble cast, as Raina Mavias, a native of Russia, taking bloody vengeance against various underworld figures, doing damage up close and personal, with her weapon of choice, a stiletto blade.  The steady string of kills so wet and messy, you can almost feel warm blood on your hands.

Crime boss Virgil Vadalos (Tom Berenger) miraculously survives having his belly slit open by Raina, his very determined ex-girlfriend, and brings in police detective Beck (Paul Sloan) to unofficially locate her for him.  Vadalos has plenty of muscle available to do his dirty work, including his head of security Alex (William Forsythe), and Lee (Michael Biehn), but the Greek is not above getting a little blood on his hands.  As Beck closes in on Raina, his partner and lover, detective Hanover (Kelly Hu), is vexed that he is not following police procedure.

In this dark journey through the criminal underworld, the early victims are mostly unknowns, but the impact is intensified by some memorable kills.  Lee experiences the wonders of brain surgery, and Hanover is the subject of a picturesque headshot.  The reason for Raina's rampage is finally revealed, and the ending is nicely ambiguous.  Directed by Nick Valleonga, and written by Paul Sloan, there aren't really any admirable characters, but the film is certainly intense, with good performances by most, including Sloan, Katic, Biehn, and Amanda Brooks as Penny, Lee's spitfiery girlfriend.  William Forsythe as usual, excels at playing a slimeball.",1257638400,15,1687,5.146520146520147
3678272,2,B001L2ZSFS,"I too bought this since admiring the work of Stana Katic in TV's sophomore season of ""Castle.""  I find her a great foil to Nathan Fillion's Rick Castle character and the camera does a lot of facial close up work highlighting her terrific expressions.  In ""Stiletto"" there is much to like with a huge character cast of accomplished actors and Stana as the stunning protagonist.  My reservation was the almost silly gore accompanying the violence.  In my opinion I think this reduced the effectiveness of the script and acting as well as the market.  Given the ranking of lower than 23,000, I'm guessing this is not one of the producer's finest moments...it could have been a wonderful opportunity to weave a complex story with great acting, but isn't.  Enjoy Stana's on-screen moments, and fast-forward the rest.  By the way, on a recent late-night talk show she pronounced her name STAH-nah KAH-tick.",1255564800,3,900,4.920529801324503
3678273,3,B001L2ZSFS,"This is yet another female revenge flick with a little twist, I won't give that away.  All of the money in this flick was spent on the cast..and with the likes of Tom Berrenger,  Michael Biehn, James Russo ( who I phkin' love and is great in this), William Forsythe, Tom Sizemore..and more...they all play their parts to a tee and make what could have been a very formulaic b flick into tons of fun.  This one is not really an original in any way...but it is entertaining, and the players all give top notch performances save for Paul Sloan who is the weakest link in the cast.  If you are looking for anything ground breaking..you won't find it here, but what you will find is a cool little indie, with great characters that will take the viewer on a fun little ride..if you let it.",1251331200,23,783,4.342465753424658
