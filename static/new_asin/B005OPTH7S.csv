8481669,5,B005OPTH7S,"This is a quality DVD and is a performance promoting the, back then, just released Revival CD. The DVD is held securely in the housing and shouldn't come out during mailing.  There is a mixture of CCR songs and Revival songs totaling 29 and lasting 1 hour and 45 minutes.  The stage is simple with some background video graphics.  A five piece band backs up Fogerty and all instruments and vocals are recorded clearly.  Fogerty tells some interesting stories.  The music is top quality.  There are no fill-in songs here.  The great Kenny Arnoff plays drums.  There are no video extras.  The main video just starts and stops.  The editing between songs is good and the show is not rushed.  There is some editing during a few songs where part of the song is clipped out.  That got annoying.  The video and music was always in sync.  There is a listing of the songs on the DVD box and also on the video at the start of each song.  There is no other information about the performance with this package.  It was an enjoyable DVD that any Fogerty or CCR fan will enjoy.  It's great to watch or just to listen to.  I'm happy with my purchase and recommend it.",1395964800,7,1152,4.404761904761905
