Until 3-4 minutes into it and I can't stop watching. It takes a couple turns here and there but one awesome movie. I'm very glad I watched it. Nice job Argentina.",1519257600,,328,4.483333333333333

8628402,4,B00GXHO0AA,"I saw this film in a theater and then again on dvd. I think the story is great and McInerny does a great job with his voice. I won't give more details in order not to spoil the story, but I think most Presley fans would enjoy it.
Just to clarify, nothing about this film is mexican, all the actors, crew and the director are from Argentina. Somebody said the main actor wasn't from Argentina, he's argentinean too, his actual name is Juan McInerny.",1466726400,,448,4.345238095238095

8628406,5,B00GXHO0AA,"This Argentinian film (originally released in 2011 by first time director Amando Bo, but just making its DVD debut) is the kind of film that you discover by having a friend recommend it to you  or maybe seeing a small review in an independent magazine.  Its what I can truly call a sleeper.  When I put it in my DVD player, I assumed it was a documentary about an Elvis impersonator and his journey to America for an Elvis convention. Boy was I wrong! First off, it is a work of fiction  which is fine with me. And yes, the main character, (portrayed by  not an Argentinian actor  but by the Celtic-named John McInerny, who in his day job is a real Elvis impersonator!) does go to America (Memphis, to be exact) for his tour, but its not what you expect. In fact very little of this 90-minute film is what you expect and thats what makes it special. And, for that reason, Im going to say as little as possible about the plot.

The film is in Spanish  with EASY TO READ subtitles in bright yellow in a font size I wish more DVDs would use  but the songs (all performed by McIlnery) all in English and there is plenty of music here. (By the way, make sure to sit through the lengthy credits to hear more of Elvis/McInerys vocals!).

The story does take a side journey about half way through  but that only adds to understanding the character.  And hours after watching this film, Im still seeing McInery in his Las Vegas period Elvis jumpsuit (with that big buckle, so I know the performance let an impression on me.

If you are an Elvis fan, youll definitely want to see this. And if you are the kind of film watcher who is willing to take a chance on a film that youve never heard of, then this is for you too.  Then YOU can tell YOUR friends about it. This is definitely a word-of-mouth film and well worth seeking out.

The DVD has a few trailers for other First Run Features DVDs but no other extras.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8628407,5,B00GXHO0AA,"First impression was another cheap Mexican production but after a few minutes I thought, ""This can't be right, this is no cheap afternoon soap-drama."", quickly checking online identified it as Argentinian. Argentina is one of a few countries in the world whose studios turn out consistently well scripted, directed and acted films. France, Sweden more often than not, Hong Kong and a few other Chinese localities.

All that aside our Elvis impersonator, besides doing a remarkable singing Elvis, deserves kudos for his captivating acting. The directing and cinematography are of high quality and as for the script - it caught me totally by surprise. There is much more to this story than just being about another impersonator. Warning: Don't read any summaries with the ending discussed before watching the film for yourself.",1394064000,,825,5.25
