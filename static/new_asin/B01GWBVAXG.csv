8763698,5,B01GWBVAXG,"This is one of Arnold's best. Take a great lineup of actors. Throw in a good story by Philip K. Dick (screen play by Ronald Shussett, Dan O'Bannon, and Gary Goldman). Add a well designed set that make you feel you are there. And you have the makings for a pretty good movie. With a few exceptions it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad and with several plot twists it is hard to know if you should root for the good guy or the bad. A hint stick with Arnold and you can not go wrong (Maybe.)

Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) a mild mannered construction worker, who is happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone), and seems extraordinarily attracted of life on Mars. Now Mars is settled and basically ran by a mining consortium. And the least Douglas can do is take a vacation there. Discouraged by his wife he decided to take a virtual trip there.

Oh no, something has gone wrong. It turns out that unknown to him he is not Douglas Quaid. He finds out that his whole history is a lie. Now people are out to kill him and he must find out who he is and why. If he escapes, the journey will take him to Mars to fulfill his or someone's destiny. Good or bad we are along for the ride.",1518998400,,1189,4.165217391304348
