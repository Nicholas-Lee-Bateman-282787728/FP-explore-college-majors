8301363,5,B001F9WIBE,This DVD is an excellent source of information on the part of China where Qi Gong is practised and the local people are at one with their culture and religion.  I visited this area of China over a two week period and wanted to keep some of the memories of Wudang Mountain.  This is the DVD for that!  Well done!,1399420800,,311,4.15
8301364,5,B001F9WIBE,"THIS IS NOT THE NAZI PROPAGANDA FILM! This is a recent production focusing on Wudang Mountain, its history, & Taoism. While it does show many skilled people performing difficult & graceful routines, Martial Arts is not the primary focus. I agree that the presentation has an educational focus, but that certainly doesn't diminish the film's value. The cinematography, narration, & performers are excellent. Some of the routines displayed made me wonder how the human body could perform such movements. I thought the narrator did a great job & didn't distract from the presentation. It is like visiting Wudang without leaving the comfort of your home. I recommend it to anyone: seeking a beautiful travelogue, interested in China, Taoism, or Kung Fu, or who loves incredible scenery.",1390435200,,782,5.214285714285714
8301365,4,B001F9WIBE,"I have seen this film several times largely for its aesthetic appeal. Beautiful scenes and choreographed presentations are not only enjoyable to view but also present an important part of the Chinese religious tradition--the sensuous and artistic.

I would say that the overall tenor of this film is educational.  In addition to the fine scenery and martial arts displays, a lot of myth, history, and philosophy is revealed in the narrative.  I think it would  be an excellent starting point for someone seeking an uncomplicated yet informative presentation of Taoism.  Its use for class room and church education programs is entirely appropriate and would be useful in structured settings.

My only complaint about the film is the narrator.  He possesses a deep slightly gravely voice that is a bit heavy for much of the material being presented and is often more distracting than enhancing.  His reading sometimes gives the film a commercial feel designed to promote tourism.  Otherwise, as a product geared for education, I would have given the film five stars.",1359244800,2,1064,5.1395348837209305
