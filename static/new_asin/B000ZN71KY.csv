8236101,1,B000ZN71KY,Really? A movie to glorify someone who kills people for a living while raising his daughter to do the same? Then we're supposed to feel sorry for him because he's terminally ill? Hmph! Not entertainment to us. This is exactly the kind of garbage young people watch that makes killing someone seem trivial. It was disgusting.,1526428800,,324,4.803571428571429
8236102,5,B000ZN71KY,A very good movie.,1508284800,,18,3.75
8236103,3,B000ZN71KY,A decent time killer a little slow paced and open ended.,1487203200,,56,4.181818181818182
8236104,2,B000ZN71KY,"A pretty standard script with especially bad directing. It wasn't so bad that I turned it off, but I thought the acting was mediocre, and the pacing and cinematography was atrocious.",1484784000,2,182,4.903225806451613
8236105,5,B000ZN71KY,This movie is deeper than you would think.,1468972800,,42,4.375
8236106,3,B000ZN71KY,It was good but I think it could have had just a bit more to it,1443312000,,63,3.0
8236107,5,B000ZN71KY,"The story is great and joe mantegna shows again his great talent in acting.
I just can advise this movie.",1349827200,2,105,4.3
8236108,5,B000ZN71KY,"While we were not sure what we would find with this little movie, it turned out to be engrossing and enjoyable. Joe Mantegna and Elizabeth Whitmere make a believable father and daughter and, although I can't say I support their line of work, I entirely believed in their characters and what they were doing.

The film sags a little a few minutes before the end, but it does end well (an open-ended finish that makes me speculate about a possible sequel).

I'm glad we bought a copy of this, and look forward to watching it multiple times.",1205280000,14,538,4.536082474226804
