8149976,5,B000JCF4UK,"What an explosive interview with actor/writer/singer STEPHEN COLLINS. From 1994 interview, Stephen talks about his new novel Eye Contact and gives a delightful, animated commentary about this first novel. The second novel, Double Exposure would follow 4 years later. I do hope he is still writing. Very talented.",1421884800,,312,5.520833333333333
