1341054,5,B00004KHDU,"I waited for years to get a chance to see Kieslowski's Decalogue, and am so pleased to have finally got the two DVD set from Amazon.  What can I say -- this is a masterpiece.  Over 500 minutes of some of the most subtle,  perceptive film making in the history of cinema.  Kieslowski's films get at  the heart of what makes people tick, and the Decalogue is perhaps his  finest work, surpassing even the essential Three Colors: Red, White and  Blue.  If you have a DVD player and are a fan of Kieslowski's work, then  you *must* own this.  The transfer is excellent and perfectly captures the  nuances of the cinematography.  You will not be disappointed.",956188800,29,654,4.543103448275862

1341056,5,B00004KHDU,"This moving ten part series that originally aired in Poland in 1989, and then swept across the rest of Europe in 1990 and '91, really put Kieslowski on the map as a World filmmaker. He was, of course, an extremely  influential filmmaker in Poland, and his ""pre-Dekalog"" films had  a tight band of international fans (I highly recomend No End). But with  these ten fifty minute films he broke open the flood gates to his last four  films- The Double Life of Veronique, and the Three Colors Trilogy. Which  are, in my opinion, among the best films ever made.
The ten short  features of the Decalogue mirror each one of the ten commandments in  real-life situations. Watching these in order is an emotional journey  that's tough to explain. The films have this Everyman feel, and somehow at  the end you feel as if you've visited the apartment complex (where all ten  films are set) in Warsaw. You feel with each of these stories a layer of  innocense slipping away. Particualry enjoyable was Honor thy Father, and  Though Shalt not Commit Adultery (which was turned into the somwewhat  dissapointing 90 minute film A Short Film About Love).
I recomend these  films highly. You won't regret the purchase . . . unless your favorite  director is Michael Bay.",949968000,49,1253,4.736111111111111

1341061,5,B00004KHDU,"Kieslowski is one of our very best directors ...worthy of mention in the same breath with Ozu.  The issues presented in these ten, one hour, films made for Polish TV are wonderfully complex moral situations.  These are films made for intelligent, thoughtful people. If you prefer films about real people, wrestling with real ideas rather than Hollywood blockbusters with no ideas, incessant action, or 3D Pop Outs, this film series may just be for you.  I only hope that one of our more conscientious film restorers (Janus/Criterion?) will take on this series for reissue. It wants a bit of cleanup and improved subtitling.

1341063,5,B00004KHDU,"I would give The Decalogue ten stars if I could.  It is easily the most profound miniseries ever crafted.  (Yes, I know that statement is hyperbolic.  No, I don't take it back.)  Kieslowski was one of the rare auteurs who created films that speak to the essence of what it means to be human.  The Decalogue is his magnum opus.  If you have never seen this show, do yourself a favor and get your hands on this set.

The acting is superb throughout and the setting, allowing for cameo appearances by characters who are the main protagonists in other episodes, provides narrative continuity. The references to commandments are mainly suggestive for beautifully wrought stories which remind us all of our frailty and humanity. Top marks....",1414972800,,388,5.946428571428571
1341068,5,B00004KHDU,"The Decalogue is a powerful collection of films about the Ten Commandments.  What's interesting about the films is that they are not a literal translation of the commandments, but explore them in an indirect way.  The films are well made and the characters make choices that aren't simple and can change the course of their life.  Each film has a different look and style to it, and the series is not formulaic at all.  Each scenario feels entirely different and unique.

I highly recommend The Decalogue.",1412294400,,505,4.825581395348837
1341069,5,B00004KHDU,"Without a doubt Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""The Decalogue"" is one of the greatest films ever made.  Whether you are planning to be or are a director, a writer, an actor or a film aficionado this is an absolute must see.  And yes it is indeed ten hours long, but perhaps some of the best ten hours of film you will ever watch.

I strongly suggest when you view this masterpiece you do not miss the fifteen plus minute Roger Ebert introduction because unlike some of the extras garbage you will find on other DVD's this one is actually quite good and he will give you some excellent ways to approach the ten stories.  Ebert will also explain that the idea for the films came when in 1985 during the solidarity trials, Kieslowski met a trial lawyer named Krzysztof Piesiewicz and the two developed the film ""No End"".  The film came up against criticism from the government who called it unsympathetic, the opposition who called it compromised and the Catholic Church who said it was immoral.  The two writers apparently met one day on the street in the rain later and Piesiewicz shouted ""Someone should make a film about the ten commandments!""  And they did.  It ran on Polish television in 1988 and the Venice Film Festival but it was not available on film in America until ten years later despite its huge praise.  All the films take place in the same apartment complex in Poland, each story is a meditation on arguments centering on moral dilemmas.  Here's a quick break down of all of them.

Decalogue One called ""I am the Lord thy God.  Thou shalt have no other Gods before me"" is about a young boy caught in between his atheist father, a university science professor and his aunt, the professor's sister and a devout Christian who wants the boy to begin studying religion.  The professor is enamored with his personal computer which is his god and he and the boy use it to measure things, the most important being to what degree a nearby pond has frozen over which works excellently quietly building the tension of the film which kicks into full gear by the end.  Here you will first meet the mystery man who appears like an angel or a Christ figure throughout all the films.  You will see him sitting in front of a fire by the lake at the beginning of the film and note that he is absent from the fire by the end.  In my opinion it is the most daunting to watch of the ten films.

Decalogue Two is entitled ""Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain"" is well placed after the first story, centering again on children. It is about a violinist who never able to conceive with her husband whom she loves deeply has an affair with another musician.  She becomes pregnant by the latter around the same time her husband grows dangerously ill and finds herself in a difficult position.  She tells the doctor, (who has an interesting story of his own which is used brilliantly to steer the story to its conclusion) she will abort the baby if her husband lives and keep it if he dies putting the doctor in a place where he is unable take his diagnoses of her husband's outcome lightly as he is now in the position to play God and determine the fate of the unborn child.  I love the way a dead hare falls off the roof at the beginning and the doctor who also lives in the same complex as her asks if the rabbit is hers (reference to her pregnancy).  Also take note of an aspidistra plant the woman tears apart trying to kill something living but not quite succeeding, the water dripping from the ceiling in the dying man's room and a bee crawling struggling to escape a glass.

Decalogue Three is entitled ""Remember the Sabbath Day and keep it Holy"".  The film takes place on Christmas Eve night to Christmas Eve morning.  Christmas Eve in 1988 fell on a Saturday. Christmas Day fell on a Sunday.  A man who is a taxi driver with a wife and young son and daughter had an affair three years prior with a woman who comes to him on Christmas asking him to help find the man in her life who has gone missing.  Her goal is to keep the ex-lover with her until 7:00 AM on Christmas Day for reasons which are revealed at the end of the film.  We see her lie a couple of times during the story and there is a very telling scene of the woman's fear at the beginning where she goes to visit her mother.  There is a quiet tension in the film where you wonder if they will or will not reignite their affair as the man says at one point he was willing, until her boyfriend caught them three years ago, to leave his family for her so there is uncertainty as which way it's going to go as the two search through the nearby hospitals trying to find the missing man.

Decalogue Four is ""Honor thy Father and thy Mother"".  It begins on Easter Monday which was on the fourth day of April in 1988, thus the fourth Decalogue begins on the fourth day.  Easter Monday is also called ""Renewal Monday"".  Kieslowski brilliantly chooses a day of rebirth to address this commandment.  The story is about a father and his young adult daughter who is studying acting.  Kieslowski chose this this as her discipline because if you study acting you may be asked to do what is called ""the letter exercise"".  The point of this exercise is to have the actor walk into the room with a goal for their character.  The actor then finds and opens a letter which contains information that changes the goal of the character upon their reading it.  And that is what this story hinges on.  The daughter finds a letter on Easter Monday from her deceased mother that her father has been withholding from her.  During the week he is gone we find out she is having trouble with her vision (Note how the letters in the eye test spell out the word FATHER).  By the end of the week she has a pair of glasses and tells her father upon his return she has opened the letter reveals to him she now knows he is not who she thought he was causing their relationship to take a hairpin turn into a direction they have both wanted and feared.  Note that the daughter sees the mystery man walk by with a small white boat on his back (possibly because of its shape suggesting a cross) as she is sitting by the water deciding whether or not to open the letter.

Decalogue Five is entitled ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"".  This is my least favorite of the stories but it is no less well done.  It is the story of Jacek who from the beginning of the film appears to have the disposition of a sociopath.  He walks through the world emotionless carrying a small bag with white rope in it.  Devoid of emotion he commits several unsavory random acts including pushing a man into a urinal, chasing away birds and dropping rocks on cars that pass under him on the freeway.  Pay attention to the way Kieslowski juxtaposes the colors red and white throughout the story: a red and white car parked next to each other, red and white boarder behind a guard and two little girls one in a red coat and one in a white one amongst other things, most importantly a red and white rod with numbers on it that is being held by the mystery man in the road.  Note the man stares directly at the number five (fifth Decalogue) and subtly shakes his head at Jacek who is sitting in a taxi.  A hideous plastic face dangles from the rearview mirror in the car which looks very much like Jacek.  He commits his crime the day before his birthday; St. Patrick's Day and he is just short of the age twenty one when he is to receive his punishment for his crime.  Perhaps this was Kieslowski making a reference to ""A Clockwork Orange"" with its twenty one chapters and meditation on the violence of youth.  You will find as the film goes alone there are reasons, though peculiar ones for Jacek's actions surrounding an incident which happens in a meadow (the meadow is shown late in the film with a bright white ray of sunlight on it) and a photograph of a young girl at communion which he takes in to have enlarged.  Young girls are shown to be a weakness for Jacek throughout the story but not for the reasons you might think.  The story is an exploration on nature and the inability to control it.

The sixth Decalogue is called ""Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery"" and this is hands down my favorite story in the collection.  Unlike the washed out sepia tones of the fifth film, this one has a bolder look, shot mostly at night using the colors white, black, blue and especially red.  The film focuses on the argument of whether love is a truth or a fallacy.  Tomek, a virginal nineteen year old man who has been watching a promiscuous female artist in her late twenties or early thirties named Magda for a year first through opera glasses and more recently through a telescope (phallic symbol) he broke into a building and stole.  You will see the mystery man smiles at Tomek as they pass each other at one point in the film letting us know there is a moral purity to Tomek.  Note his telescope is covered with a red cloth matching the bedspread in the woman's apartment and the sensuous way Tomek removes it before looking through the lens.  Tomek sneaks money order notices into the woman's mailbox so she'll visit him at the post office where he works.  The two characters see each other through glass a lot in the film such as windows of the apartments and the protective glass he sits behind at the post office.  Tomek is an orphan and the attraction to the woman is oedipal denoted by milk either being delivered or spilled at different points in the film.  Tomek takes a second job which allows him to bring her a bottle of milk every morning.  Note that of all the milk crates on the cart he picks up the one that is blue.  You will often see Tomek wearing blue (true blue as in love) and at the end he is in black, a color commonly worn by Magda.  Red is used to represent two things the first being love and passion.  In a scene where he asks Magda out for ice cream (a milk product) the two are framed by a window bordered in bright red.  Magda's phone is red.  But the second meaning of red takes on a more sinister symbolism.  Pay close attention to the scene where Magda finds her opera glasses in a box symbolizing a shift in power and the change in the color's meaning.  It is at this point we see her argument against love tested right after she has severely challenged Tomek's argument for love.

The seventh Decalogue is called ""Thou Shalt Not Steal"" and the villain here is a truly detestable human being.  The film asks the question can you steal something if it already belongs to you.  It tells the story of Majka a twenty two year old student who has a six year old daughter Ania.  The two live with Majka's father and mother Ewa.  Majka tells her father she can no longer live with Ewa.  She has been planning for a few years to escape with her child to Canada.  The father of the child was Majka's teacher and she gave birth to the child when she was sixteen meaning she slept with him when she was underage thus putting him in a position to be up for charges.  Ewa was the headmistress of the school at the time and used her power to keep the teacher from being charged and used threats to keep the two lovers apart thus allowing her to steal the baby.  Much like the pigs do with the puppies in ""Animal Farm"" Ewa has been manipulating the young girl ever since the child was a baby to believe she is her real mother and even attempting to do such things as breast feed it and keep Majka from being able to comfort her.  Shortly after kidnapping Ania and escaping with her, Majka goes to the teacher, Ania's father who ironically makes teddy bears for a living now and attempts to reunite father with daughter.  The question is can she trust him?  Pay close attention to the color red in this film as a symbol for bloodlines.  The girl wears a red coat.  The phones switch back and forth from being black ones to red ones.  Also note that the train at the end, which is also red leaves on a Sunday.

Decalogue Eight is called ""Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness against Thy Neighbor"".  At the beginning of the film a female student presents to an elderly female ethics professor (the film's lead) the story we see played out in Decalogue Two as an argument of ethical hell.  The professor tells the student and the class that because the child lives that is what matters.  A visiting female professor from New York who's come to sit in on the ethic professor's classes wears a gold chain with both a cross and a chai continues with the discussion with a new story...a true one.  She tells about six year old Jewish Girl who in 1943 is hiding in a Polish house until she loses that hiding place and finds refuge in a new home but her new guardians say the child must acquire a certificate of Christening.  The woman's story is disrupted when a drunken man enters the lecture hall.  One of the students tells him to leave, which is a set up for what happens next.  The visiting professor goes on to say the girl is rejected by the Christian people when she is delivered there.  They say holding her would be an act of bearing false witness if they let her take refuge with them and the girl is turned out into the cold. Note that the mystery man is one of the students sitting in the lecture hall and we see him as soon as the words bearing false witness are mentioned by the visiting professor.  The film then becomes a revealing of who the girl is, who turned her away and the reasons behind their actions.  Notice there is a picture in the ethic professor's apartment no one can straighten.  Also note the professor tends to gather what look like white chrysanthemums and put them in a vase in her spare room.  White chrysanthemums represent truth.

Decalogue Nine is ""Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Wife"".  It is the most tense of the films because it is about sexual tension.  Note there is a scene where the lead character must put a hose into a gas tank that is as explicit as anything you'll see in porn.  A surgeon (ironically named Roman which means strong and powerful) is diagnosed with permanent impotency which is a blow as he's been with his fair share of women.  He has a beautiful wife with gold hair his doctor suggests he divorce as his situation is irreversible.  On his way home after finding this out the mystery man rides around him on a bike.  This incident will come to bookend at the end of the story.  The film, much like Decalogue Six plays with bold colors, most importantly the color blue.  But where Decalogue Six uses blue to denote true love here it is to represent the inability to find sexual release or ""blue balls"".  The doctor's scrubs are blue, the files on his work desk are blue, his wife wears a blue suit for work, the device he uses to listen in on her calls is blue, the bike he rides (in a sexually suggestive scene) is blue and so on.  The doctor suspects shortly after his diagnosis his wife is cheating on him.  He finds a physics notebook in his faulty glove box and throws it into a dumpster but retrieves finding it lying next to a blue wrapper suspecting it belongs to his wife lover.  He finds out on one of her phone calls the young man sent her a humorous picture of the Pope which shows the man of the cloth looking though his fingers suggesting spying much like the doctor begins to do.  He copies one of her keys to a location where he hides on the stairwell.  He hides in a closet and watches her.  He asks her a physics question.  To further torture him, the surgeon has a pretty young patient who needs drastic surgery in order to sing opera.  He is attracted to the girl and his inability to perform sexually becomes more and more of a cross to bear as he deals with both her and his search to find if his wife has been unfaithful.

The tenth and final Decalogue is called ""Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Goods"" and this one is a change of pace because it is a black comedy about two brothers whose father dies.  It is the most plot driven of all the stories.  The older of the two has to go retrieve his younger brother who is a rock singer (check out the lyrics he's singing) at one of his concerts to give him the news.  (I might note here the actor playing the younger brother also plays the lead in one of my favorite films, Kieslowski's ""White"").  After the funeral they find at their father's apartment alarms, padlocks and bars on his windows.  They cannot figure out why...until they discover he was an avid collector of stamps and coins.  We also find out the man was a miser and his older son had to buy him a suit to bury him in.  But we also find he collected many newspaper clippings of the youngest brother's music career.  A man comes by the apartment saying their father owes him money.  He says he could just take something of his fathers for payment instead and the brothers become suspicious.  They decide to take some of the collection to a stamp exchange. Before they do the older brother gives his son a set of three zeppelin stamps and thinks no more of it.  When they show some of the collection at the exchange they are immediately sent to meet with the Commissioner because everyone in the stamp world knows their father.  I love how he points to a single stamp and tell them they could by a Fiat with it, then two cars for the next two stamps and an apartment for the next.  The collection as a whole is worth tens of millions of dollars and their father was going to insure it for two hundred fifty million but died before he could.  He advises they keep the collection together.  But when the older brother returns home he finds his son has swapped the zeppelin stamps to a con artist who has sold them to a dangerous collector.  Shortly after older brother discovers there was one stamp their father was unable to acquire.  Their father has the yellow one and the blue one but not the Austrian rose Mercury 1957.  Mercury, by the way is the Roman god of financial gain and also the god of thieves and trickery.  The younger brother recovers the zeppelin stamps from the collector who then tells them he knows how they can acquire the Austrian rose Mercury...but for a price.",1411084800,6,18100,4.355694692903995

1341075,5,B00004KHDU,"Krzysztof Kielowski's ""The Decalogue,"" is a collection of deep and philosophical musings played as morality tales. It's also about a group of middle class Europeans trying to organize the drama and often the chaos of their lives, while dealing with their personal doubts in Catholicism. It was considered by Stanley Kubrick as one of the greatest series ever made. It has certainly endured since its original telecast in the late 1980s, recently being revived by cineaste with a thirst for films containing mature themes about life and death.

Kieslowski's 10 stories each focus on a specific Commandment, and some stories repeat or build on the more important basis of each Commandment. However, it's not wholly necessary to have a Christian basis to understand these influences, some of the characters themselves don't even directly discuss God. Its more about the nature of what the Commandment's stand for, and how they rue or guide the expectations for their lives, whether brought to good or bad outcomes.

Each story takes place around Christmas time; this setting however is not chirpy and cheerful, and there are no happy misgivings. In fact, the season is more like a backdrop, with the glimmering Christmas lights creating a haunting atmosphere against the dramatic arch's of Kieslowski's characters. Kieslowski wrote the script which was inspired by novice writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz's intention to make 10 films about the 10 Commandments, initially for Polish TV. The series had a large run being played either on T.V. as 10 parts, or as two 5 hour presentations at film festivals.

Now after years of waiting, here is the entire series collected over three disc. Even though the visual quality of the film is NOT on par with the story, I adhere that to the labor of the DVD company responsible for the release. It isn't digitally sharpened, and resembles the look of a VHS rather than a DVD. However, this is the ONLY attempt made by ANY company to release these 10 films, which are a canon in European cinema. So on that basis, I commend them. In short, there are no other films more serious, more intelligent, more thoughtful about the nature of Catholicism and its influence on the lives of middle class as this one is. Kieslowski's ""The Decalogue"", deserves to be viewed and discussed, and now finally it can be.",1388793600,4,2331,4.956521739130435

1341080,5,B00004KHDU,"Dekalog is a path-breaking ten part film series on the meeting of the divine and the human in cinema. This series made for Polish television in 1988, and directed by the extraordinary director Krzysztof Kieslowski, brings to life the moral temper of the ancient world and its forbidding ethos as its weaves through the modern world as we know it. The experience of the film, the mysterious hold it has in bringing back those ancient laws fully alive and present in the most intimate moments in ordinary lives of people, reiterate their invisibility among the ordinary perceptions that abound in this world, and their visibility if only there were new eyes to see and watch for those miraculous moments crystallizing at the very center of this world.

The ten films strung together as small nihilistic mood pieces resist easy interpretation. Their illustrative power emerges in moments. The surprise of these moments literally sweeps us over. We are immersed in the absorbing reconciliatory emotions despite the unforgiving world of these ""moral tales"". While we are not aware of a single moral lesson being pushed on us, we sense moral seriousness in the very atmosphere of these tales. Human beings find themselves caught in incredible periods of joy before they are stretched to the very limits of human resilience.

The insights these stories share have general applicability and power since we are made aware of the way of the world, the general order of things. By allowing ourselves to feel our way through the real dilemmas presented here, we absorb life's grandest lessons without being able to really say what they are. These lessons transcend human understanding, and the only ""lesson"" we can articulate is that the real truth of it all evades the reach of human capabilities. This claustrophobic revelation of the human condition prepares the viewer for an unexpected experience of the divine. The depth of the moral lessons come alive only after we follow the details of the story and when we are allowed to feel the emotional plight of our protagonists with a rare intimacy.  Human knowledge, duty, love, destruction, deceit, and greed, have their limits, but the human struggle to confront these perennial limits, to understand humility and its place in the world, to reconcile, to forgive, to weep, to smile, lingers on. These become the marks of the ecstasies and desperation of being human, how the finite caught in the hands of the infinite must forego triumph and freedom, even when they emerge glimmering in fleeting moments of refuge and solace, in a sea of fate.

Kieslowski's Dekalog is a deeply tragic vision close in spirit to Carl Theodor Dreyer's Ordet, P.T. Anderson's Magnolia,  and the matchless meditations of Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovskii. But there is nothing like this ten part film in world cinema, for its scope and relevance. The film series present a new suggestiveness about the limits of being human, and offers a compelling vision of life that cries out for a greater understanding of the place of the divine in the knowable world. The dilemmas it chooses to emphasize in the stories, the agonizing misunderstandings, the fleeting periods of deep happiness, the iron law of necessity hidden beneath all the surface possibilities and freedom in life, become compelling arguments for why the divine should be invited into life again, especially when that life looks as familiar, or universal, as the sights and sounds of a Polish cooperative housing society. This world of human longings and frustrations becomes an apt microcosm for all that is harsh and redeeming in our world.

The stories heavily dwell on the emptiness of modern life, its spiritual confusion and squalor. But it is precisely in this emptiness where a credible space for a God haunted world can emerge. In this bleak world, as a background, the reality of the unseen takes form in the most unlikely of characters. The divine swells to fill the human spaces in tantalizing suggestiveness. God seems to move in the form of a nameless presence. We are never quite sure if we are being shown a benevolent or malevolent presence, only because  the divine, if one call it that, is put in the film by Kieslowski in fleeting, feeble, half-hearted, images of a wanderer, who, will take turns closely observing, watching over, the lives of the characters in these ten stories.

Kieslowski finds a way to weave a viable representation of God into the human canvas of his greatest film, Dekalog. The stories continue to stand with all their human interest and they are hardly subordinate to a theme or idea that is explicitly theological. The integrity of Kieslowski's characters, as autonomous human beings struggling to live their lives with all their limitations, lights up this deeply human canvas. Kieslowski's stories are left intact, and only then in some mysterious way does this great artist manage to bring us in contact with a transcendent theme that ties these stories together as an integral whole.",1362009600,,5016,5.013205282112845

1341082,5,B00004KHDU,"""The Decalogue"" (i.e., The Ten Commandments) is a ten-episode, made-for-Polish-television drama series from 1989 directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski, and co-written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz. Each of the ten episode is approximately one hour long and each uses one of the Ten Commandments as a central theme (sort of). These dramas are the very best I have ever seen on television. They are complex, mature (adult), often subtle, and emotionally powerful. In fact, these dramas are so emotionally hard-hitting, that many folks might be unable to watch them: I have a friend who was still crying days after watching the first episode.

Very little American television is produced for adults. I would guess that American television directors target their programs for twelve-year-old kids. In contrast, ""The Decalogue"" dramas have adult characters dealing with complex, adult themes. I have never before seen anything on television that matches the intellectual and emotional impact of the ""Decalogue"" films.  Kieslowski is a brilliant director. He is a poet really. Where other (lesser) directors might require a long, explicit monologue,  Kieslowski can communicate volumes of deep, complex human thought and emotion with just one subtle glance, word, or expression.

Krzysztof Kieslowski is the director who later made the awe-inspiring Three Colors Trilogy of films (""Red,"" ""White,"" and ""Blue), as well as ""The Double Life of Veronique.""

1341086,5,B00004KHDU,"Dekalog is a a ten-part made-for-TV mini series.  Some people say that most of the episodes deal with moral choices.  I find that the episodes deal with life's situations that people find themselves in or that they create for themselves.  A reviewer writes, ""Although the stories have received a subtitle to associate each of them with a commandment, these were not present in the original vision of the director and were added later by the Venice Film Festival's press office.""  I find this imposition to be somewhat of a distraction.  One reviewer writes, ""The ten films are apparently based on the ten commandments, but this relationship is tentative.""  I find the relationship nonexistent.

You are better off disregarding the subtitles as well as the interpretations of the episodes.  The interpretations given for the collection that I have, like the subtitles, are imposed.  For example, Dekalog I is subtitled ""Thou shall have no other God before you.""  However, the professor and his son do not worship their computer, a theme much discussed at the time that the episode was made.  The man has confidence in his calculations because he is a student/teacher of the discipline.  Nature intervenes; thus, the result is beyond human control.  It is not a punishment for breaking a commandment, which is implied by the subtitle: it is what happens to some people in life.  Dekalog III, subtitled ""Honour the Sabbath Day,"" is another example.  It is not about disregarding the Sabbath.  It is about a divorced woman trying to insert herself back into her ex-husband's life because of her loneliness: she is a person desperate to cling to the only time in her life when she felt love.

 The scenes are presented in a ""very muted, monochromatic color,"" another reviewer writes.  It seems that the director's view of life may be the same.  We see ""Very well done portrayals of people dealing with difficult situations.""  Overall, the episodes are examples of fine filmmaking, and the project is something that any director/filmmaker would be proud to put his/her name to.  Dekalog is well worth viewing, and purchasing, as is examining other people's views of it.",1256256000,,2163,5.0
1341087,4,B00004KHDU,"Krzysztof Kieslowski was a Polish filmmaker from Warsaw (1941-1996) that brought great pride to a country that has had to overcome many hardships in order to survive. This is one of the reasons I love the Polish people. Another is that I grew up with them in my native Chicago, Illinois. They are a resilient, strong, and intelligent people. Above all, they are amongst the most caring and generous souls I have ever met. It is fitting then that they had a brilliant filmmaker who stayed in Poland through thick and thin to document their lives.

I was thinking of how I might describe Krzysztof Kieslowski's`The Decalogue'. My thoughts kept coming back to the American series `Twilight Zone'. We know it is a series of ten episodes. Each one is a loose study of one of the Ten Commandments. We are also aware that each episode has a character that resides in the same group of Warsaw apartment buildings. Yet, none are carried over into subsequent episodes. Finally, it is clear that `The Decalogue' was filmed in 1988. So let us go a bit deeper. It is something Kieslowski would insist upon based on his character studies.

Krzysztof Kieslowski co-wrote each segment of `The Decalogue'. His collaborator was Krzysztof Piesiewicz; a lawyer who Kieslowski felt added a different perspective to compliment his own style. Kieslowski directed every movie. I originally thought that he was consulted on every aspect of the filming, as like a Coppola might be. However, I found out that Kieslowski invited nine different Cinematographers to participate. He gave each one total freedom on their movie. He remarked in an interview that this brought freshness to each episode. He said that he was particularly concerned that the crew not be bored.

The characters in the movies run the gamut from young to old, clever to naive, and intelligent to foolish. However, each has a common thread running through their lives. Each must make a decision that may change their lives. This is reflected in each of Zbigniew Preisner's dramatic and sensitive scores. The movies are intense and there is little in the way of action-based sequences. Some of the episodes may bring sadness, while others tend to make one reflect on the subject matter.

I favored the first and last episodes. In particular, Decalogue X has a nice comedic touch throughout and it is a great way to end the series. Kieslowski certainly emphasizes that point with the last lines uttered in the Decalogue. It is his signature and a fond farewell to a wonderful project. Included below are a few lines of my initial reaction to each of the ten movies.

Desire is an inferno not easily controlled by mere mortals.  Add anxiety and deadlines to the mix and one can only hope to handle the flame without being burned. This is precisely what one self-absorbed individual is seeking to accomplish. Standing in the way is a wise and resourceful individual who might be the solution, but also garners her scorn.  The results are predictable only in the fact that nothing is certain and God still has the best curveball in the game.

How fully has a life been lived when its meaning can be replaced with a sentence?  What we know can sometimes be the furthest thing from the truth, if we convince ourselves it is so. This Decalogue examines the value we place on our relationships. Quite often, the outcome tests the very foundations they are built on. Moreover, to be sure, that is why they are laid in the first place.

Moreover, it turns out to be anything but free.

1341088,5,B00004KHDU,"Krzysztof Kieslowski was a filmmaker from Poland who made his name in the 1980's.  I first encountered his work in Blue which was not well received in the United States and was regarded as rather cutesy and sentimental.  I saw it and loved it however.  In fact I couldn't get it out of my mind.  Later, White and Red came out and each time the film received a better review and the filmmaker was given a second look at by American critics.  I saw much of The Decalogue when it was shown at the Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman House in Rochester, NY.  The theatre is a museum and a movie theatre for older or art films.  The curator at the time was European and knew many European films and filmmakers.  The Decalogue was not shown widely in the US because it was a television production in 10 episodes.  Even trying to see it in a theatre 2 at a time meant a dedication for a week I couldn't fulfill.  I was happy to get this DVD for Christmas and relive the episodes that I had seen before and see the ones I missed.  My favorite?  Probably the last episode, which contains considerable comedy and humor after many dark episodes.  Two brothers inherit from their father a valuable stamp collection of Nazi stamps circa 1933.  The urge to apprise their value turns them not only into greedy hostile men but they become surrounded by greedy, hostile men who have the goal of stealing the collection from them  It is a great episode emphasizing the fact that having what you thought you wanted can ruin your life.  The other episodes are just as good and intriguing.  A young man wanders through a seemingly calm quiet summer day and ruthlessly murders a taxi driver without sound reason.  Kieslowski doesn't let him off the hook as the man takes a long time to actually die and the young man has several chances to stop.  On the other hand, the death penalty the man suffers is quick and clean.  But is it moral and right?  Other episodes address morality and belief in other ways.  The episodes are thought provoking and never let the viewer off the hook in easy ways.  I found the extras on the DVD well worth watching also.  Kieslowski was a director during the time of martial law and the end of communism.  In Poland, he had to be very careful about what the government saw in his films.  In a TV interviewing show called 100 Questions, Kieslowski must take questions from a TV audience who seem primed to ferret out if there is any criticism of the government in his films.  Other directors fled to other countries, Kieslowski either couldn't or wouldn't go.  He artfully has to tell his audience that the only reason he was a director is that he was sent to film school for it, has no political criticisms in his films, and only wants to tell personal truths.  It is not an easy time and good insight into a communist regime albeit a mild one at this time.  I highly recommend this set and urge fans of foreign film to purchase it.",1232064000,,2942,4.424581005586592
1341089,4,B00004KHDU,"Art that can claim greatness deals with complex issues in complex ways. If the answers or questions posed were simple they could be framed in a single sentence, or a ten second film, then the art would not be its own best explanation. This thought stuck with me as I watched Krzystof Kie'lowski's complex and fascinating, if flawed, The Decalogue, illuminating aspects of the Ten Commandments from the third, transitional phase of his career, which included this 1988-89 Polish television series, filmed in 1987 and 1988, as well as the two subsequent feature films derived from episodes five and six, A Short Film About Killing and A Short Film About Love. Kie'lowski's filmic career can be divided into four parts. The first was his career as a documentarian, the second was his early fictive films, and the fourth and final part was his final films- The Double Life Of Veronique and the Three Colors Trilogy (Blue, White, Red). The Decalogue (Dekalog), released on three DVDs by Facets Video, after a decade and a half in the wilderness, is where Kie'lowski's potential for greatness first had more than a few flickering moments. No, unlike many critics who declare the whole series a masterpiece, I'll say it's certainly it's not. It has a few excellent to great episodes, a few good solid ones, and some mediocre ones, but without this proving ground, his later masterpieces would not have been possible.
  The series is not a simplistic set of parables nor morality plays, but short stories, snapshots of Poland two decades ago. Yet, so many critics, then and now, got and get so much about the series wrong. Regarding episode two, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert writes, `The film is about their separate moral challenges, and not about the two of them locked together by one problem.' This is absolutely wrong. The doctor has no moral challenge; he violates his ethical responsibility. The reason he does so is interesting, but his is not the problem the film is about. That Ebert conflates the two says something about his own beliefs, but nothing of the film. He then writes, of episode nine, `She did the wrong thing (adultery) and the right one (ending it); his spying was a violation of her trust- and then there is an outcome where pure chance almost leads to a death, which was avoidable if either had been more honest.' Well, no. There is no chance- pure or not, in the lover's pursuit of the wife nor in the husband's decision to suicide, and Ebert wholly misses the importance of the husband's impotence and the male ego. In the Christian Science Monitor, critic David Sterritt claimed the cinematography was `expressive,' even though it is the antithesis of that, as it is very static. Perhaps he confused these films with the Three Colors Trilogy? Of course, just as literary critics can be subject to off the rack blurbery, so can film critics, many of whom were as dense as Ebert and Sterritt.
  But, it's not just American critics who miss out on the film's import. A Polish-Canadian film scholar named Christopher Garbowski, wrote in his book, Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue Series, that the characters share a conscious or half-conscious desire to `transcend the details of their existence.' Again, wrong! Simply desiring a move away from one's lot is not in and of itself `transcendence.' When I read such things I sometimes wonder if a) the critics have even seen or read whatever thing it is they're reviewing, and b) do they even know the definitions of half the words they use? Yet, to be fair, critics are not the only ones who can botch assessments of works of art. The great American filmmaker Stanley Kubrick offered this treacle about The Decalogue: `These films have the very real ability to dramatize their ideas rather than just talking about them....They do this with such dazzling skill, you never see the ideas coming and don't realize until much later how profoundly they have reached your heart.' One of the very reasons this series fails the `masterpiece' litmus test is because there are too many times you can see exactly what is coming. The most obvious times are in episodes one, five, and eight, where the ends are known within the first few minutes, even though determinism is not central to the series as a whole, which refutes the argument that this blatant obviousness was intentional.
  The Decalogue is its own best explanation, but what it conveys is not always the best it could be. Such is the lot of all art. But, without its failures and successes, the greatness that Kie'lowski achieved in his final portion of his career would not have been so sublime. Failure and success can thus be both complex and simple. Discerning the two from the two is called criticism.",1221782400,,4731,4.834567901234568
1341090,5,B00004KHDU,"Had it not been for a friend who has the time and the intellectual curiosity to seek out films like these, I would still remain blissfully ignorant that The Decalogue even existed. But thanks to her, I have something new to evangelize to friends and acquaintances.
I am not going to rehash the stories here. Other reviewers have done so, some in great detail. What I will say is that Krzysztof Kieslowski's masterpiece is a fascinating and often spellbinding set that engages the mind and stays with you long after you put it back in the box. The films are spiritual without being overtly religious and the viewer is forced to consider all the vagaries of the human experience. Zbigniew Preisner's penetrating and often melancholy score adds permanence to the impression made on the viewer by these remarkable films.
Though sometimes you may have to think hard about what the connection between a particular commandment and a particular story is, the connection is there even if that connection is tenuous. I like all the films to a certain degree, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be Decalogue Ten. Title of least favorite would go to Decalogue Three.
As at least one reviewer said, you may find it useful to listen to Roger Ebert's commentary on this set before you begin viewing. I don't usually put much stock in a five-star review if only a couple of reviews of an item have been written. But in this case, with more than sixty reviews written by such a disparate group, near-unanimity actually means something. The Decalogue is one of the most thought-provoking film sequences I have ever seen, and is a set I will watch many times more.",1214784000,,1652,4.7
1341091,5,B00004KHDU,"This series is just outstanding, and well worth the abundant praise it has received.  This is truly a landmark series.

At the present time, there are upwards of sixty reviews of this series of 10 films made for Polish television by the director Krzysztof Kieslowski.  There are individual reviews for individual episodes, and, as could be expected, some episodes are stronger than others.

I'm going to comment on the whole package.  I do agree with some of the reviewers that the quality of the films leaves something to be desired.  However, the fact that these films are even available at all tempers my criticisms on the film quality.  They are often dark with details hard to see (and is it ever sunny in Poland?) but they are watchable, and the setting (the iconic communist monolithic apartment complexes) as well as the cinematography is certainly more than OK, and inspired many times.  The film quality doesn't detract from the stories at all.  You'll get the message(s).

As far as the writing, the themes, the subject matter, well, you'll never see qualities exhibited by this series anywhere near American television ('The Mole' or 'Farmer Wants a Wife, anyone?).  Serious, brooding, thought-provoking; this is television that you just can't expect to see anywhere on commercial television in the United States, sad to say.

Highly recommended.  Buy a copy.  You'll want your friends to watch more than a couple of the episodes.  As I mentioned in this review's headline, this series will stay with you.  Maybe one day the series will be remastered and the quality improved.  Still, it's worth the price.

Update:  It's been a while since my wife and I watched the series, and yet I could tell you the plots of most of the episodes.  They just won't let you go.  This man was a master.  This would be such an excellent addition to your video library. Very highly recommended!!!",1214179200,3,1891,4.862068965517241
1341092,5,B00004KHDU,"Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Decalogue"" is a series of ten short films set in a block of towering flats in modern Warsaw. Co-written by Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz for Polish television in the late 1980s, the ten one-hour-long episodes explore each of the Ten Commandments, although many of the Commandments actually overlap one another.

The series is profoundly meditative, without being boring. The actors are remarkably believable, especially when Kieslowski relies on close-ups of the face; the soul of their character is practically laid bare. Very intimate. I was particularly struck by the guardian angel or witness - a young man (Artur Barcis) - who appears in eight of the episodes, just before a Commandment is broken.

It's hard to say which episodes are the best. Each one projects a powerful moral message, forcing you to consider both sides of the issue and to realise these time-honoured laws have many ramifications in our daily lives, even today. My personal favourites include episodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10.

Roger Ebert's commentary at the beginning is an excellent primer to those unfamiliar with Kieslowski and the synopsis behind ""Decalogue"", and I would recommend viewing it before the series.

Lastly, one need not understand the Polish language or culture to appreciate ""Decalogue"". For that matter one need not come from a Judeo-Christian background.

1341095,5,B00004KHDU,"The Decalogue (Krzyzstof Kieslowski, 1989)

The first thing you have to admire about Dekalog is the incredible scope. Just look at it--the thing, all component parts together, runs just shy of ten hours. (It has eclipsed the previous longest film I've ever seen, Shoah, by about half an hour.) It's huge and audacious and the kind of thing you will never, ever see from Hollywood. Think about it: it's longer than the entire theatrical run of The Lord of the Rings. And this in a movie where nothing blows up, there are no animated trees, and the only monsters are those of the human psyche. Who's going to sit still for ten hours of existential crisis?

It seems Hollywood still thinks this; the long-awaited DVD release of Dekalog in the States was conducted by Facets, a small production company who, it seems, deal exclusively in critically-acclaimed imports. Stuff, in other words, the bigwigs wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole, but stuff that needs to be a part of the public consciousness. One way or another, though, the average American is now capable of seeing Dekalog. I'm not sure the average American should, but it's a must for any serious student of film, or even for any casual film buff.

Dekalog, based (loosely) on the ten commandments, offers ten short (each is slightly under an hour) scenarios. Each deals with a person in crisis, and how that crisis affects the person and those around them. At times, the crisis does not come until relatively late in the film (Dekalog: Jeden); at other times, it already exists before the film begins, and forms the core of the action (Dekalog: Piec). Either way, these are not people who are going to have happy endings. This is telegraphed (no, shouted from the rooftops) by every facet of the filmmaking process, from the project-like housing block in which the stories all have their genesis to the bleak lighting (while Kieslowski used ten different cinematographers to give each film a different style, the differences are overwhelmed by the similarity in atmosphere) in which the characters conduct their various businesses.

Choosing a favorite is impossible, but for me, the strongest point in the series comes in the middle, the fifth, sixth, and seventh installments. The fifth and sixth are reworkings of Kieslowski's similarly-acclaimed A Short Film About Killing and A Short Film About Love, respectively. The fifth takes two killings--a thrill-killing and its governmental retribution--and contrasts them. It's chock full of social context without being preachy (and it probably comes off preachier than it should, given its context in a ten-commandments series), but the viewer is simply presented with the scenario, rather than beat over the head with it. The sixth deals with a lonely post office clerk who spies on his neighbor across the street, then finally works up the nerve to approach her; her series of reactions over the next half-hour are subtle, complex, and plausible, far away from the pop-psychology idiocy an American would have probably ascribed to the scenario. (cf. my recent review of Spanking the Monkey.) The seventh is their equal, a story of two mothers fighting over one's child, and how their struggle, which has been tearing their family apart for years, finally reaches its breaking point.

Not to say, of course, that the rest aren't worth watching. To call one episode better than the other is to speak relatively, as all are brilliant. (The tenth is probably the weakest of the lot, for various reasons, but it's still wonderful.) I cannot recommend highly enough taking ten evenings, sitting down each evening, and watching Dekalog. It is an experience not to be missed. **** ",1184025600,2,3685,5.00326264274062
1341096,5,B00004KHDU,"""Decalogue"" (1987) directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski, heartbreaking, thoughtful, dark films - well written, masterfully directed - with great attention to the smallest details, and wonderfully acted.

Decalogue 1 - ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me"" - The first film in the series is one of the most powerful. Amazing performance by Wojciech Klata as young Pawel. Made me think if we all, the prisoners of our PCs are as guilty as Pawel's father is.

Decalogue 2 - ""Thou shalt not take the Lord's name in vain"" - Dorota (Krystyna Janda) is torn by the most difficult choice a woman has to make - between two lives.

Decalogue 3 - ""Thou shalt remember the Sabbath and keep it holy"" - as in all episodes I've seen, the acting is very good - this one features Daniel Olbrychski as a family man who was forced to leave his wife and children on Christmas Eve and try to help his ex-girlfriend to find her missing husband.

Decalogue 4 - ""Honour thy Father and Mother"" - Girl's mother died right after childbirth, leaving a letter for her. Father seals letter in a second envelope, ""Not to be opened until my death."" The girl opens and reads the letter which leads to unexpected complications between father and daughter -their relationship would never be the same.

In astonishingly disturbing, depressing, and powerful Dialog 5, ""Thou shalt not kill"" , a cruel young man (Miroslaw Baka) wanders through the streets of Warsaw in search of a random victim whom he will murder in cold blood. He will be arrested, put on trial, found guilty and executed. Did he deserve his punishment? Yes. Was his execution the legal murder? It depends on how each of us looks at the capital punishment debate.

Decalogue 6 - ""Thou shalt not commit adultery"" - One of my favorite episodes - a tale of a 19-year-old shy and quiet postal worker who peeps on (and later stalks) his beautiful, free-spirited neighbor. They meet later with tragic consequences. Fascinating and very clever.

Decalogue 7 - ""Thou shalt not steal"" - A young woman (Majka) kidnaps her daughter (Ania) from the child's grandmother (Ewa, Majka's mother) whom the girl thinks is her real mother. Ewa who never felt close to Majka sees in Ania her real daughter. There are no winners in this tragic family war.

Decalogue 8 - ""Thou shalt not bear false witness"" -deals with the guilt associated with the Holocaust, attempting to reconcile the direct victims and those who were not bad or cruel people but were too frightened to do something to help. An American woman returns to Poland to face a famed lecturer who during WWII refused to help her, a 6 year old girl at the time, to find a hiding place from the Nazis.

Decalogue 9 - ""Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife"" - This is a story of the words misinterpreted, the important phone calls missed by a second. The loving couple has to deal with the serious problems that include the husband's impotence and the wife's infidelity. She loves her husband and does not want to leave him even after she learns the sad truth about his condition. She wants to end a strictly physical affair with a younger boyfriend. Her husband does not know that and the tragedy of errors just about to happen... Decalogue 9 is also interesting because in it we first meet the main character of Kieslowski's later film, ""Double Life of Veronique."" Roman, the hero of Decalogue 9 is a heart surgeon and works in the hospital. One of his patients is a young, full of life girl who loves to sing and has a heart condition. Her favorite composers are Bach, Mozart, and Van den Budenmayer (a fictitious Dutch composer whose music is written by the regular Kieslowski's associate, Zbigniew Preisner).

Decalogue 10 - ""Though shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods"" - is about two brothers who have not seen each other for over two years and meet for a sad occasion - on their estranged father's funeral. Well, it was not too sad because their father never had been too close to them - his obsession and the love of his life was his stamp collection - one of the best and most valuable in Poland. Along with the collection, the brothers inherited their father obsession for stamps and even though they desperately need money, they try to expand the collection, delving in the underworld of devoted philatelists and shadowy dealers (sometimes, there is not much difference between both types) who have known very well about the priceless stamps. Will the brothers be able to expand the collection or to sell it with great profit and live happily ever after? How much and what are they willing to pay for a small piece of paper? You have to see Decalogue 10 to find out. I just will tell you that Kieslowski is always in control here and for such a small amount of time, only 50 minutes, there is so much action, characters development, so many unexpected and original plot turns, such excellent exploring of human emotions and drives that it would (it should, it did for me) keep you riveting to the screen.",1176681600,,4987,4.66325369738339
1341097,5,B00004KHDU,"For most viewers, 'Three Colours' was the entry point into Kieslowski's approach to cinema. A flair for ambiguity, challenges to morals, and intimate camera work were quirkily matched to sensual and sexual dilemnas. But if this was arthouse cinema from the chic end of town, all Parisian glamour and buzz, it was the gritty, if not grimey northern sensibility of the 10 Commandments, that is Kieslowski's mid 80s masterwork. The lighting throughout seems contaminated by acid rain. There's a dense macabre atmosphere, by turns flicking from pathos to brutality with the ease of a tale from the Grimms. It's these beguiling episodes, so economically shot, that earned him the acclaim and rights to be mentioned in the top tier: Bergman, Pasolini, Tarkovsky, Dreyer, Bresson, the coiterie that pose the Big Questions with authoritive magnificence and allow their cameras to suck away at the world's textures. This DVD has a useful interview with Kieslowski who acknowledges the pivotal role of his long and fecund association with legal eagle, Piesiewicz. He is astonishigly candid with the assembled Polish intelligensia while scathing of their lack of useful critique: adored outside his coutry, reviled or too challenging within. The cast throughout are uniformly excellent. The children are astonishingly good in very demanding roles. Reviewers have their favourites and I concur with those who rate episodes 1, 5,(where the camera eye hauntingly tunnels its way to the inexorable gallows scene)  9 and 10. But this is only to place them as scintillating(if such sombre themes can be so deemed) rather than merely excellent. In the introduction American critic, Ebert whips through the stock praise for the director, with minimal insight for acquainted viewers. He's right though about the emphasis Kieslowski gives to the face. The episodes rebound on you, and doubtless, like me, you'll enjoy replaying these brilliantly filmed urban tales for years to come.",1170720000,,1962,5.329032258064516
1341098,5,B00004KHDU,"The series itself is one of those works that bleeds profundity and symbolism in everything it does. A bunch of short--yet highly well-rounded and fully developed--character dramas dealing with Universal themes of ethics, love, passion, and guilt, Kieslowski's Decalogue is a continuing but heavy portion of art and cinema and classical music, among other things.

While not all of theme are technically interwoven with each other, they do share visual and thematic motifs with uses of color, recurrent props and sets, and a distinctive wide-angle lens close-up framing that helps the audience really look and regard every aspect of the character the film is following. This recurrent use of cinematography is held despite the actual production involving nine different cinematographers, which helps show the power of Kieslowski's personal vision and how he's able to bring it out on screen.

It's definitely not something that can, nor should, be watched in one sitting, but it is continually enjoyable throughout each episode.

1341099,5,B00004KHDU,"The Decalogue is indeed as collosal and as moving as people have said.  Each film is inspired by one of the Commandments, although the commandments are never mentioned directly.  Kieslowski made these films all in one year, which to me is amazing.  This was made for Polish TV, showing that television doesn't have to be completely stupid all the time.  All of these segments are full of moral ambiguity, and clear answers are never given, just like in real life.  I love the fact that Kieslowski never answers things directly.  If this was an American production, it would have gone 2 ways.  First, it could have been a right wing, simplistic, heavy handed ""message"" film that would have been dumbed down to the level of a 4 year old, like an ""Afterschool Special"".  Or it could have been a whiny, left wing politically correct ""tolerance"" episode where everything would have worked out because people are basically good and everyone needs self esteem.  Either way is both insulting and disingenuous.  I especially like the 2nd film, where a woman, who is having an affair and is pregnant by her lover, has a husband who is the hospital.  Her husband could possibly die.  She pesters the doctor to find out about her husband's condition, partly out of concern, but because of her fetus as well.  She tells the doctor that if her husband lives, she'll abort the fetus.  If he dies, she'll have the baby.  That's a very murky, morally ambiguous situation.  When sitting through this part, I wondered what I would do in that situation.  I haven't a clue, really.  When I saw Clint Eastwood's masterpiece Million Dollar Baby, I thought of these films, because Eastwood's film and Kieslowski's films dealt with morally complex issues in an adult and artistic way.  These films are about life and art.  There is no time in this film (or the other segments) where you feel that you're being lectured to, and I love that about it.  It's about religious things, but religion isn't mentioned.  It's about morals, yet, you don't feel that it is.  It's great art, that's all, and that is enough.",1151452800,4,2084,4.743732590529248
1341100,5,B00004KHDU,"This is a brilliant series. When I first received it, I watched one every evening with friends and found myself spending my days looking forward to the next episode. The films are very well-made, well-written, and thoroughly captivating. Kieslowski's take on each of the commandments is often completely unexpected and always intriguing. I can't recommend this series enough. Well worth the money.",1142553600,8,397,5.419354838709677
1341101,5,B00004KHDU,"This is an amazing series filmed in black and white in the late 1980s.  All 10 stories carry a theme from one of the 10 Commandments and involve to some degree, people from the same apartment complex in Warsaw.  Each film depicts a person or persons grappling  with personal, moral issues.  While there is a silent witness who appears through out the series, the the dilemmas are presented matter of factly and without judgement.  The judgement is simply for the audience to determine.  Let the stories unfold for you.",1138233600,6,518,4.764044943820225
1341102,5,B00004KHDU,"Kieslowski never took the easy way out. Each hour-long film is intricately plotted, beautifully filmed and loosely examines the spirit of the Ten Commandments. But the filmmaker never beats these moral themes on our heads. Kieslowski once said in an interview that he always turns the camera back on himself, but never in an obvious way, and I think this effect is achieved here. Forget the Polish for a moment. Turn down the sound and you would still be able to identify this as Kieslowski's film. They could be authored by no other. My favorite is the underrated tenth installment about coveting your neighbor's goods. On one level, this film is a riotous comedy, paring the co-stars of White together as two brothers who lose their father, but discover his stamp collection . . . only to lose it(and a kidney to boot) to the Poland's stamp mafia. But on another level, it is a profoundly moving film as well. The stamps are a tenuous connection to their father(who they obviously never understood)and to one another. Losing their father's collection, they start one anew and booze it up, enjoying one another company . . . honoring their father's memory . . . and fulfilling one of those universal commandments.",1137024000,10,1214,4.813397129186603
1341103,2,B00004KHDU,"The Decalogue is one of several excellent TV series by European directors that puts US TV to shame. Like Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"" & ""Fanny & Alexander,"" von Trier's ""The Kingdom,"" Fassbinder's ""Berlin Alexanderplatz,"" Kusturica's ""Underground,"" and Petersen's ""Das Boot,"" The Decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to US viewers' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run. Unlike these other series, Kieslowski's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block (and characters from one episode may pop up in another).  The stories of The Dekalog are morality plays, but they are not re-enactments of The Ten Commandments, but rather inspired by them, and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two.  Kieslowski & Piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves (instead of contracting 10 of Poland's best up & coming director's to do each, as was initially planned), and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories.  I won't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so, and I feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them, so I will comment on Kieslowski's style. Kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature.  His films often tackle issues of political import, however he intentionally avoids making ""issue films,"" but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected, as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture. His views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in Poland before, during & after the Solidarity movement. Initially he started as a documentary film maker, but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects, he switched to his unique fictional style.

This Facets 3-disc set of The Dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available, in that the picture quality is a little better, however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if Criterion had released this series. First, Facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu. To add to that, you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode, very annoying. Then the picture quality isn't as good as it could be. Not only is there evidence of flaws in the film (scratches and blotches), but the film isn't a true digital copy of the original series, but rather a copy of someone's PAL tape of the broadcast, so the image is no better than watching a VHS tape.  The picture is also cropped from the original, especially on the bottom. The picture at times jitters, especially during the ending credits. The English subtitles are minimal, at times missing dialogue, and can not be turned off. There are some nice extra features, particularly a broadcast from Polish television of an interview of Kieslowski with a number of Polish journalists. However the quality of the picture of this is worse than on The Dekalog, and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in English with no option to turn of the English dub & use subtitles instead. Apparently all of the other (imported) editions of The Dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition, which is inexcusable given the price.",1136419200,52,3705,4.845181674565561
1341104,5,B00004KHDU,"Kieslowski took the Ten Commandments and made them become allegories of life in Poland during the 80s. There is no much to do to entertain yourself, colors are dull, pollution is all around, products are of bad quality, yet people live intensely each moment, and are perfecly capable of reaching happiness... as long as Ten Commandments are respected.

The central theme of each film is very religious, it means that the violation of each one of the commandments triggers sooner or later dramatic consequences for the sinners. Yet those rules are never evoked as religious: under Kieslowski they become universal laws, implicit but still omnipresent, you cannot escape from them by not believing - or pretending not to believe - in God.

But I do want to go on record as saying that this is an excellent series.  If Polish television is this good, it far surpasses American tv.  Most of the episodes are relevant to that famous decalogue, the ten commandments, but they aren't all relevant to it.  However, they are all interesting, and the series is a treasure.  My favorite episode is the one about the man who learns that he is never going to be able to have sex with his beloved wife again, he agrees to allow her to have a lover, and then his jealousy won't let him live with that solution.  It is quite an indictment of adultery, and a very emotional episode.  See them all.

1341106,5,B00004KHDU,"A collection of stories loosely derived from The Ten Commandments. Stories about passion and the emotional and intellectual conflict as its consequence.  True, we have freedom of action, but our actions are often motivated by internal forces that we cannot understand or control. If God put these forces within us, how can He then expect us to follow His commandments? Perhaps the answer lies within the confused struggle of need/want with what we SHOULD do. Though all of the characters from the 10 stories live in the same apartment complex, each of them are alone and secluded. There is a constant conflict between fear of reaching out to other human beings with the fear of emotional isolation. The moral position is in constant motion, often being passed from one character to another in a single scene. The Decalogue attacks the intellect by first connecting with us emotionally, leaving us with a very real sense of the struggle. Kieslowski never preaches to his congregation and morality is never black & white, for these stories are all part of a grey world - the real world. Here there are no happy endings, only a heavy dose of ambiguity and the instinctive need to struggle on. Kieslowski used different cinematographers for each episode but the music of Zbigniew Preisner permiates all 10 episodes and opens up the heart, further exposing us to the characters emotions and bringing us that much closer to genuine understanding.",1106784000,9,1440,4.975103734439834
1341107,4,B00004KHDU,"I bought this DVD set because I was such a huge fan of Blue, White & Red.  I also enjoyed the Double Life of Veronique.  I found the premise intrigue with the Decalogue.  I mean, 10 one hour stories base on each different commandment.  First of all, let me say it isn't obvious, which makes it very very good indeed.  It doesn't hit you on the head with ""HAVE NO OTHER GOD OTHER THAN ME"".  But the patience required in viewing these is to view all ten because it is truly a remarkable achievement in story telling AND in conveying the 10 commandments in a way no other filmmaker can do, except for this wonderful director.  I can tell you now, that it will not be for everyone.  The story is in Polish with english subtitles, but it's best to watch it that way because, just like in american films, people's subtle way of talking and stresses ads as much to the film itself than mere dialogue.  Kieslowski intended the story to be told in that way and dubbed dialogue would, perhaps, ruin those little subtle nuances.  But the key to the decalogue is not the film itself, but the lesson and honesty it protrays in the story and in the film making process.  It let us know that a story that has been read millions of time and told thousands of times and probably film in dozens of ways, can be shown in a refreshing, wonderful light that one can never hope to imagine and inspire us to look at the bible again.  There is no glitz here, no CGI, in fact the set takes a backseat.  It is the story that matters and the wondeful thing about these stories is that the people act normal.  No overly dramatic characters is what makes this film a worthwhile see.  If you are a film student, it is a must see.  This is the type of work that leads to discussions and that is a good thing.  The one drawback that I have with this is that the video is rather dark.  But then again, it was filmed quite awhile ago.  Another note, you have to be in somewhat and openminded and serious mood to watch this film.",1089244800,13,1994,4.241379310344827
1341108,5,B00004KHDU,"Kielowski made a glorious work. This set talks about the relativeness you may approach every one of these ten commandments.

In a miserable building Kielowski will show us with no mercy sight the claustropobhic space in which the polish citizens live. All along the stories there will be serious ethic conflicts between the letter and the spirit of every commandement and the resolution usually goes on the opposite side of the real spirit of the commadment itself.

Specially remarkable are the Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10.

1341109,4,B00004KHDU,"Krzysztof Kieslowski obviously had a thing about ""theme"" series -- the Color trilogy, the unfinished ""Heaven"" project... and of course, the Decalogue, a wonderful collection of made-for-TV movies that focuses on the Ten Commandments. Kieslowski's style is not at its most polished here, but unpolished Kieslowski is still magnificent.
Kieslowski ran the full range of emotions in the Decalogue -- he'll make you laugh, then cry, then stare in disbelief. In one, he presents a man and his son ""playing God"" with a computer; in another, a murder is followed by execution (""thou shalt not kill""); a woman lures her lover away from his family on Christmas Eve (""keep holy the Sabbath""); and the delicious black comedy where two brothers inherit their dad's valuable stamp collection (""thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods"").
By Hollywood standards, the Decalogue probably shouldn't exist. Not only is it religiously-themed, but was made on a very small budget and written in under two years. But Kieslowski proved his mastery by creating the one-hour short movies (two were screened in longer form), and loosely stringing them together.
Don't expect the obvious in Kiewslowski's movies. This is no Sunday-school storytelling, with hell awaiting two-dimensional sin. It's a series of delicate, subtle stories about people who seem real, rather than allegorical paper dolls. At times, Kieslowski becomes too heavy-handed, like in the admirable (but obvious) fifth story about capital punishment. Okay, we get it -- all death is terrible. However, he's subtle more often than not.
As with the Colors trilogy, there's a web of interconnected stories, with characters who brush by each other but don't actually touch. Not to mention that mute guy who watches from the sidelines -- a Kieslowski touch. But there the resemblance ends. The settings are bleaker, and the characters are less effervescent. But under the grayness and grime is his undeniable talent, his sense of sadness and gravity, and his sympathy for those who stumble morally.
Krzysztof Kieslowski used a tiny budget and bleak backdrops to create a modern masterpiece, a sprawling movie in ten parts. Watch the commandments, one by one, in the form of the Decalogue.",1083628800,31,2227,5.240896358543417

If you are put off by the pretentious sounding concept of ten short films based around the ten commandments, fear not. Kieslowski approaches each topic from a very human perspective, not allowing simple moral conclusions to show the viewer that ""sin is bad"" and hell awaits you. This movie is about humanity. Nothing less, yet it connects on a personal level as well as a spiritual one. Inspiring.",1075075200,16,504,4.872093023255814
1341111,3,B00004KHDU,"After watching all ten hours of The Decalogue (plus extras), I must say I wasn't all that impressed.  It was worthwhile as the chance to see the early work of a director who later gained international repute, but not particularly entertaining or rewarding to actually view.  The acting is terrific, some of the camera work and individual shots approach being memorable, and there were various interesting elements I'll discuss further in a moment.  However, the picture quality is generally poor (understandable under the circumstances of creation), the subtitling is inconsistent, and the stories are all very gloomy and depressing except the tenth film.  (""Decalogue Ten"" was supposed to be ""humorous"" according to Kieslowski's comments in the brief ""On The Set"" featurette.  I grinned once and never even chuckled at all.  At least it wasn't so grim as the other nine tales.)
As to the interesting aspects of these ten films, one is how the characters overlapped sometimes from film to film.  and that's NOT including the ""silent observer"" who appears in each film, a linking element I found relatively pointless to the level of annoyance.
Film critics apparently have a professional code that forces them to describe nearly every foreign film as a masterpiece.  I'm not living under any such code, so I'm free to be honest and just say I didn't like The Decalogue all that much.",1065916800,14,1382,5.030701754385965
1341112,5,B00004KHDU,"Those familiar or fond of Krystof Kieslowski's ambitious ""Trois Couleurs: Bleu, Blanc, et Rouge"" Trilogy need look no further for proof that Kieslowski is one of the greatest directors in the history of film. Sure, he didn't have a ""Citizen Kane"" or a ""Godfather"" in his repertoire, but he does have a film that, in some respects, nearly equals those works: ""The Decalogue."" Sure, it sounds like a gimmick, and even a turn-off to those not interested in Biblical adaptations. The great thing about ""The Decalogue"" is that it's neither of those. Kieslowski's film spends just under an hour with each one of the Ten Commandments, exploring through average citizens of Poland the moral implications and quandries of each commandment. Don't try and figure out how each film directly connects with each commandment, though. Really, the ten films overlap in the different commandments that they contain - ""Decalogue One: Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods Before Me"" seems the most direct relation to its commandment in the whole series, while ""Decalogue Two: Thou Shalt Not Use The Name of the Lord In Vain:"" seems an abtstract correlation at best. The point of these simplistic yet powerful films lies not in explaining the commandments - ""The Decalogue"" takes universal issues within humanity and places them on the screen with beautiful subtlety, while profound explanations lurk beneath the surface. Each film has a basic plot, and within it lies an examination of the basic morals that lie within the commmandments and intwine deeply in human nature. Quite simply, ""The Decalogue"" is an essential experience for film buffs and humans in general.
A FEW NOTES ABOUT ""THE DECALOGUE"":
1.  Some are better than others (1,5, and 9 in particular) but all have their perks. Basically - watch them all!
2.  While the notion of watching them all at once seems fun, these films are better when viewed one or a few at a time. A reviewer from Entertainment Weekly suggested watching over a period of a few days late at night. One can imagine the types of thoughts that would arise in THOSE dreams.
3.  Each Decalogue is a very introspective experience for the viewer, but additional fun would definitely come from discussing them with friends.
4.  If you do purchase ""The Decalogue,"" be ready for an unforgettable experience.",1065398400,14,2307,4.9689119170984455
1341113,5,B00004KHDU,"I watched this series on the Sundance Channel after reading a review saying that it was the ""best film ever made"".  By the end of the series, I could only agree.  Unfortunately, I find it completely indiscribable.  Perhaps, I could say that no director has ever captured humanity so well.  Every serious director should study this film to see what ""less is more"" means.  Astounding.",1053216000,15,382,4.815384615384615
1341114,4,B00004KHDU,"Unquestionably one of the landmark films in cinema, The Decalogue was a 10 part television series. As Krzysztof Kieslowski's pivotal masterwork, it should be seen by everyone seriously interested in European Cinema. However, the version I purchased from nyc99 via Amazon lacked one important caveat, when noting the DVD is an ""import"" version. The package is titled ""Dekalog"" and all the text on the cases and enclosed book are in Korean.
The films include both English and Korean options for the subtitles but the extra features are mostly in Korean. The English subtitles suffer from typographic errors and major spelling/syntax errors that suggest the lack of an qualified English-speaking person reviewing the titling. The titles also flash by in some sequences, offering no chance for even fast readers to complete the sentence before it is replaced. Thankfully, the titles are formated to be easily read over any image background.
The prints used in transfering the film to DVD are marred by dust, scratches and cue marks (for reel changes) that detract from the overall image quality. The sound track is converted to Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo.
However, the ~1 hour documentary ""I'm So-So..."" is excellent (except the subtitles) and provides insight into Kieslowski's life, sensibilities and humour. This was noted to be only available on ""import"" versions of the DVD set.
The boxed set of the films (5 DVDs plus the DVD documentary) are nicely packaged. It is unfortunate that the booklet remains accessible only to those lucky enough to read Korean. If I had been aware of this caveat at the time of purchase, I would have selected an alternate issue of the set.",1043452800,36,1669,5.072727272727272
1341115,5,B00004KHDU,"The Decalogue is like a very masterfully written short story collection by Maupaussant or Chekhov. The tales are each very stark and the cinematic style adopted is equally stark. The later Three Color(Red, Blue, & White)series tells similarly stark stories but the difference is in the cinematic style which for those later films is warmer and richer and has a dreamy quality. In the three color series Kieslowski uses tinted lenses and a much more poetically rich vocabulary of visuals, ie interesting and lingering close-ups on inanimate objects which serve as objective correlatives of an inner state, and this more subjective visual style makes the stories feel intimate, as if we are witnessing the world through someone elses eyes. The Decalogue uses a no frills approach, each story is told concisely in a compact span of 50 minutes so though visually stark they leave no time for the viewers interest to lag and ultimately its the poignant content of each story that sticks with you. Each segment of the three color series stars a beautiful actress, this combined with the more poetic visual style gives those later films a different kind of feel. The Decalogue focuses on humanity, its focus is not so much on individuals as on human qualities/situations which are universal. Each film in the Three Color series focuses on the respective life crisis of one individual. The stories do address large themes(loss, love, fate)but its how those large themes manifest themselves in the singular destiny of a very specific individual in each of those films which resonates strongest. The Decalogue therefore is like a group of tightly constructed short stories whereas the Three Color series is like a trilogy of almost symbolist novellas. As a series the individual films of the decalogue fit together perfectly, and as the series progresses certain characters from previous episodes make brief albeit poignant appearances in later episodes. The result is a rich and layered tapestry of human experience. The three color series are individually strong but they are self contained films and do not fit together as a series in quite the same way. The stark feel of the episodes of the decalogue which each take place in Warsaw might turn some viewers off who are used to the often dreamy quality of the three color series where much of the action takes place in and features Paris. But for a growing number of admirers the Polish based Decalogue is a masterpiece of poignant precision and Kieslowski's greatest accomplishment. Seeing the ten episodes of the decalogue one after the other a cumulative effect builds within the viewer which leaves one speechless--there is nothing to compare it to(except Kieslowski's own work) because nothing else like it exists.",1037923200,18,2763,5.0747252747252745
1341116,5,B00004KHDU,"I bought this set based soley on the reviews here on Amazon.com and was not disappointed at all.  These ten inter-related films are well written, very thoughtful, well filmed, and have interesting twists in the story; yet are infused with a haunting and touching realism.  Perhaps the best ability of the great Kieslowski is his deep compassion for people caught in the midst of life's difficult choices, and his ability to render those experiences meaningful in his films.  There is a beautiful humanism underlying all his films; you get the feeling that these are almost documentaries.  There is nothing contrived in the stories or in the acting.  The feel, tone and depth of understanding of the human condition expressed through these films is light years beyond anything any overpaid executive in Hollywood would be capable of making, let alone even understanding.  These are some of the most philosophically enriched films I have ever seen, and I would certainly put Kieslowski in the same category as Ingmar Bergman. I absolutely love these films and wish they were more well known in America. These films will speak directly to your soul and you will be enriched by the wonderful gift Kielsowski has given to you!",1033084800,14,1221,4.990147783251231
1341117,5,B00004KHDU,"This is truly a great set of films, a great work in this form of art. I could go on, but would just be repeating what most people on this page as well as the New York Times, Chicago Sun Times (Ebert), Newsday, and a host of other reviews have stated with much more eloquence than I can muster. Five stars, no question. If there were six, it would get six.
But here's something that few have mentioned: This set of films was MADE FOR and SHOWN on Polish television. Polish TV! Good Morning! We get ""Friends"", they get ""The Decalogue"". Wait a minute, weren't we the open society that promoted free speech, creativity and genius? And weren't they the totalitarian state that censored the creative and spoon fed the party line to the public? Watch TV here for ten hours (the length of ""The Decalogue"") and tell me what we're getting spoon fed. Sewage, to put it nicely.
Ok, in all fairness, ""The Decalogue"" is a gem - a big diamond, and it's probably as rare on their TV as it would be on ours. And on occasion we get some gems too, mostly on PBS. But here's the difference, they had the strength to show this series on TV. Can you honestly see ABC, NBC, CBS, or FOX airing this series, or, if it existed, the American equivalent of this series? I bet that if ""The Decalogue"" was shown to the programming directors of the Big Four (assuming they haven't already seen it), they would probably be in agreement that it's great art. I also bet that none of them would have the guts to air it in 10 uninterrupted one hour segments on their network. Too strong, might offend someone, not PC, not enough commercial time, blah, blah, blah....bottom line: it wouldn't air. Maybe PBS would do it, maybe. About 20 years ago a local station in Colorado aired ""The Deer Hunter"" (also a great movie), completely unedited, with only one commercial break. So it can happen, it's possible. It would be good if one of the networks found the strength to air this series, it deserves to be seen on a much broader scale. It might even spoil our appetite for sewage - worse things could happen.",1011398400,33,2068,4.430446194225722
1341118,5,B00004KHDU,"There are so few films - even ones that I would give 4- and 5-star ratings - worthy of study as literature, that it is a somewhat overwhelming experience to watch Krzystof Kieslowski's The Decalogue and realize that he managed to make ten of them. Yes, they are of varying quality; there are better and worse films in the series.  But they are all, without fail, thought-provoking; deeply stirring. In retrospect, I am almost ashamed of the four stars I recently gave Hannibal - but I was applying a vastly different standard to that film.  Compared with the usual Hollywood drek, it was quite good, with its cheeky fusion of low-brow grand guignol and smart literary references. Compared with The Decalogue...well, it would deserve negative stars.
Originally seen on Polish television, The Decalogue consists of ten hour-long films that each illuminate one of the Ten Commandments.  ""Illuminate"" is the right word, too. No simple-minded Sunday-school lessons, these.  The films of The Decalogue set up the sort of difficult moral dilemmas people face in the real world - the kind of dilemmas that turn seemingly simple choices into profoundly difficult matters of conscience, where every possible path seems shrouded in the gray mist of uncertainty.  Big issues like abortion, the death penalty, religious faith, and sexuality are explored with as much frankness as artistic restraint. It is this restraint that makes The Decalogue suitable not only for adults, but for young adults, too.  Decalogue Six, for example, would make an appropriately sober introduction for teenagers to the prickly complexities of sexual ethics.  I wish I had seen it when I was about fifteen. If and when I have children of my own, I fully intend, when they are the right age, to sit down and watch The Decalogue with them.
Each film seems constructed with an eye toward stimulating deep discussion.  Invite some friends and family over.  Watch a couple of films in The Decalogue series, then serve drinks and hors d'oeuvres. If the evening does not result in at least two or three hours of meaningful dialogue (and perhaps heated debate), nothing will.
But I don't want to reduce The Decalogue to a mere set of conversation-starters. Like great short stories, the films have a genuine power and profundity that kind of sneaks up on you. Even if you watch them alone, they will reward you with many hours of fruitful contemplation.  One needn't be religious to find meaning in them, either.  The secular and the scared find common ground in The Decalogue - even in the illustration of such specifically religious concepts as the first commandment's admonition to ""...have no other gods before Me.""  This particular film (the first in the series) is the most heart breaking. You don't have to believe in God to be moved by its story of tragically misplaced faith.
No American studio or network would dare finance and release something like The Decalogue.  The ""lowest common denominator"" philosophy of American culture has led to a shameful dumbing-down of film audiences. Why, in a country such as ours, with its surplus of skilled cinematic craftsmen, can we only rarely produce films with the kind of thematic quality present in the classics of Asian and European cinema?  Fortunately The Decalogue is available to us in this DVD set.  If you care about cinema - what it CAN be, as an art form - then it belongs in your collection.",999475200,60,3414,4.93368237347295
1341119,4,B00004KHDU,"The Decalogue is an absolute must for the Kieslowski fan. A set of ten films produced for Polish television illustrates the ten commandments. Music by Kieslowski's friend Preisner. Same strong combination you have seen in the Red, White, Blue trilogy.
Unfortunately, the DVD production is disappointing. You can't switch off the subtitles and I personally find this very annoying. On the other hand, the DVD is not region-coded. Since there is no DVD release of the Decalogue in Europe yet, this set is the choice for the real Kieslowski fan, but not for someone who just wants to check out this director.

1341122,5,B00004KHDU,"If you plan to buy this DVD title, do so promptly.  Its first pressing in April '00 sold out very quickly.  After months of unavailability did a second pressing come out.  Eventually, it will be out of print altogether.  Those who first saw THE DECALOGUE in the 80s had to wait until now to see it again.  And due to its length, it has hardly been played in theaters or aired on TV.  If you miss this video release, you may not have too many more opportunities to see it again in your lifetime.
The picture quality of this 3-disc DVD set is fine, but not stellar.  Darker scenes (many scenes take place at night) are especially problematic, but they are not by no means unwatchable.  English subtitles are white and permanent; they sometimes omit snippets of dialog that are not crucial to the story and whose meanings should be obvious to the viewer (such as greetings, yes, no, dad, mom, etc.).
This Polish TV anthology comprises of 10 individual one-hour episodes that cleverly ""adapt"" the Ten Commandments into real world, 20th Century dramas.  Some episodes are affirmations of the commandments, albeit they are dramatized in ways you don't always expect; for instance, ""Thou Shalt Not Take the Name of Thy Lord God in Vain"" is turned into a story of a doctor who in effect becomes God in determining the life and death of an unborn child.  Some episodes are, however, attempts to make us rethink the meanings of the commandments.  In the ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"" episode, we first witness the murder, but we are later made to feel empathy for the murderer.  In the ""Thou Shalt Not Steal"" episode, we witness the ""theft"", but later we are confronted with the question: who exactly owns the thing that was stolen anyway?  In the episode of ""Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery"", we are first made to despise the ""adulterer"", but later we sense that perhaps he does harbor some true love?  All in all, THE DECALOGUE is a unique, intelligent meditation on life whose 10 compelling stories should give you plenty of food for thought.",989193600,11,2026,4.654494382022472
1341123,5,B00004KHDU,"I was introduced to this set of DVD's through one of the listamania lists here in Amazon. What a profound surprise!
The director, Kieslowski unfortunately will never know or see  the appreciation of a world wide audience of this stupendous piece of cinematography since he passed away in 1996.
Kieslowski filmed these 10 full one hour movies in Poland which allowed him to use artistic licence  to accentuate only the important iisues of the subject matter. We are not disrupted in the viewing by unncessary eye candy or gratuitous action as the director gently leads us to concentrate on the subject matter at hand. The acting in these films is so crisp and clear one can see that it was a labour of love. In Decalogue One the face triumph and pride of the young son as his father defeats a chess champion is something that will stay with me for as long as I live, unbelievable strength of emotion that is rare to see.
Although the decalogue is presented to the viewer as Kieslowskis' presentation of the ten commandments in the real world, I found that trying to find the hidden religious messages was a waste of time since the films have considerable more depth and meaning.
Even though the DVD's lack much of a today's wide angle super techinicolour pizzaz (I never even knew that dolby digital mono sound tracks existed) this is a must have set for anyone that wants to watch a true masters work.",987552000,11,1401,4.622489959839357

Actually, I saw all of these movies long ago when they were transmitted on Yugoslav television every Monday evening for ten weeks :) I was really suprised and delighted when I saw that DVD version is available and I bought it immediatelly. Of course, I am about 10 years older now and I see all these movies in different light and I can only say that they are timeless pieces of art non comparable with any mainstream, or if you will, Hollywood movie. If you have seen Three Colors Blue, White and Red from the same director, although those three are great I look at them as a mixture of art and ""commercial requirements"" stated by French producers. On the other hand, Decalogue is a PURE ART without any financial expectatios from the creators. Technical stuff: picture is not great since these are relatively old movies shot with not so good equipment. Sound is mono. But that is not the point.

1341125,5,B00004KHDU,"These ten films are the greatest achievement of European film making in the last twenty years. Shot with a visual economy and brutality of style which grew out of Kieslowski's work in documentary, they are at once profoundly wise and unflinchingly honest. Each individual film is a self-contained masterpiece, almost aphorisitic in their brevity and understated rhetoric. All the works concern various individual and overlapping lives on a vast Polish housing estate, and are filmed in colour which seems to have been drained of all but the most sombre hues. The theme of each film is drawn loosely from the ten comandments and explores what those imperatives might mean in a modern context. There is a profound sense of locality, with the films growing out of specifically Polish experience, yet never seeming parochial. Seen through Kieslowski's lense that vast housing complex really does become an entire world. The most famous of the series are those which gained independent release as ""A short film about Killing"" and ""A short film about Love"", but make no mistake, the quality of all the works is uniformly high.
Anyone who has come to know Kieslowski's work through later films such as ""The Double Life of Veronique"" or the ""Three Colours Trilogy"", might be surprised by the absences of beautiful effects and flights of poetic fancy. These are not films which offer the comforts or almost mystical catharsis of his last works. Instead they turn an unflinching gaze on some ordinary lives, focussing on the meanness, solitude and quiet desperation of ordinary people, but by doing so they ultimately offer moments of redemption and humanity which put them into the same rank as the later portraits of Rembrandt. These are films to return to again and again. If you let them they will get under your skin and allow you to see the world with a ""Kieslowskian eye"", not necessarily a seductive or beautiful vision, but one which has a richenss beyond virtually any western art (not simply cinema)of the last twenty to thirty years. In the long run it is with these films that the greatness of the director will come to be understood, rather than on the more self-conscious works which gained him a wider audience in the west.

Through this 10-hour meditation on the nature of man, life, religion and ethics, you will be given a new vision of the world. A world that is beyond words, beyond any command(ment)s, that just trespasses the very limit of any drawn ethical line.

1341127,5,B00004KHDU,"First produced for Polish television before the collapse of communism, Kieslowski's _Dekalog_ takes it's name from the ten one-hour episodes which comprise the series.  While the ten films draw their inspiration -- and sometimes their titles -- from the ten commandments, the mapping is not so basic.  And surprisingly, the film is not a preachy lecture on going to church.
In each episode, Kieslowski follows a few people from a Warsaw housing complex.  He does not create his characters; rather, they become known to the audience.  None of them are evil.  But getting to know these people means you see how they care for one another and how they hurt one another (often unintentionally).

This tiny theater on the rue Champillon showed 2 episodes of the Decalogue  every day at noon.  After seeing one of these screenings, I made it a point  to see the rest of the films.  I didn't stop after I'd been through the  cycle once.  I got friends, neighbors, and acquaintances to go with me.  No  one was able to make it through the cycle without acknowledging that this  Polish director, whoever he was (there were no credits on these prints) was  a genuine genius.  Not merely a filmmaking genius as the word is thrown  about today, but a true master -- a person of unique talent who knew how to  capture a moment of pure emotion on film in such a strangely precise way  that even the most cursory of moments  seemed emotionally dramatic.
Years pass.  I watch Kieslowski become an international celebrity.  But  I don't go out of my way to see the Decalogue again; I'm too afraid that my  vision of the films is too wrapped up with the youthful memories of my  bohemian days.  Finally, the DVDs are released, and I can't resist anymore:  I get them the day they come out.  Nothing about the films has aged.  They  are still truly great, moving, and masterful.  Each of them is a small  masterpiece -- but as a series, the films are cumulatively astounding.

Speaking as a Christian believer myself,  they are not particularly religious in tone but there is some discussion of a deity and a worship scene in the first film. I don't think Krysztof Kieslowski professed faith per se (not sure) and think he was more agnostic on the whole. The films do show how moral choices are right at the heart of how we live and their consequences on others, too.

Anyway, this is spectacular cinema  (far far more than a tv mini series) and Stanley Kubrick was known to be a  great admirer of this set. Kieslowski once said he struggled with the difficulty in conveying emotion visually. He needn't have worried as he was an absolute master at it using symbolism, close ups, long shots, music and fly on the wall listening in on important conversations. He treats the viewer with great respect, 'setting up' the scenarios and the emotional impact is at times quite overwhelming especially in the first one and the sixth  (you shall not kill). But all of them have a sadness at core. I'm saying this as this film is some of the most hard hitting cinema ever done especially for a certain type of person, who may be watching, who puts themselves in the character's shoes.

Another benefit of watching these films is to be taken to Poland in the 1980s. The stories are set in very ordinary tower blocks for the most part and the actors are more 'normal' than in the average film on our screens.",1483920000,,1528,4.534545454545454

They are all bizarre, strange, and dark. Don't waste your money.",1483142400,2,349,4.555555555555555
