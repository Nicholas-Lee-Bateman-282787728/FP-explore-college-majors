525909,5,6302897386,"I love this movie!!! Although it meant to be frightening, it turns out to be funny. Paige's naivet leads her to an Ouija board. It belongs to the previous owner of her apartment, who happens to be a dead tranny exotic dancer. The dead woman manipulates Paige, and eventually possesses her.

525910,4,6302897386,"As usual I agree with the other reviewers. The original, however, is the better flick. Partly because of Tawney Kitaen and partly because the plot is more involved. Amy Dolenz does a pretty good job, she looks pretty cute too, but the original Witchboard seems to have much more substance. Personally I recommend both.

Laraine Newman looks pretty good too. What's up with her dog named ""DO""? She's stuck in 1969. VW bus and all.",992476800,,429,4.72

525941,5,6302897386,"Well here goes this one is another one for the Ouija board but must say it's very interesting and will keep you on your toes, The acting was great and the storyline is just as good. This one is about a young lady moving into her artist loft, with only one thing on her mind and that's art. During her moving in and placing things around the room she discovers a Ouija board in the closet and soon discovers she is not alone at all. Told by her boyfriend not to go any further with the game she gets trapped and when other people start dying around her she must try to stop this thing from any further damage and close the door. Will she succeed or not that has got to be seen. I rated this an A grade for the  twist and turns involved in the plot that have you thinking. A fabulous night in with a great movie and entertainment plus for relaxing with feet up. This is only my opinion and so now it's your turn to take a peek and see what you think.  Enjoy!",1434067200,3,956,4.026315789473684

525982,4,6302897386,"this is an o.k. sequel to a almost forgotten b-horror film starring tawny ""julia"" kataen, but amy dolenz does a great job in her roll. this film for me takes about 30 minutes to get into it. what i figured out about this film which had always bothered me, was the post
hippie element played by lorraine newman from early s'n'l. it IS julian mcmichael's character & former playboy magazine model whom plays the devil in the last five minutes which helped make this film barely palatable. when it was over, i wiped my brow in relief.

again this is only a good film if you like dolenz over applegate female actors.",1412899200,,612,4.464285714285714

526016,4,6302897386,"This sequel falls short compared to it predecessor but still enjoyable.
It's about a girl named Paige who rents a apartment then finds a ouija board and conjures up a spirit. It gives her more confidence at work, relationship with her boyfriend, and begins to do her passion she once abandoned ""painting"". She always gets more attitude and starts to dress more revealing.  She But she becomes addicted to it because the spirit is telling her it was murdered and Ami wants to find out more. Little does she know that the spirit is actually evil and is trying to exact revenge on the landlord and her family of the apartment complex.

The kills are creative but there's not as many, the script is alright, and it's more comedic than the original. So that's what keeps your attention through out the film, it sure kept mine.",1383609600,,821,4.616438356164384
526017,5,6302897386,"The transfer of this movie to Blu-ray was done quite nicely. I had a very good VHS copy that was dubbed to a DVD+RW disc since 2008. That copy, which surprisingly came out very beautifully onto disc, was all that was available till now. This Blu-ray blows what I had before out of the water. This is not a bare bones release either. There are lots of nice extras on here. This is my favorite of all of the witchboard films, and I am so glad they chose to release this one first on Blu-ray. I have the 1st one and 3rd one also, but I would rather have the 3rd one released on Blu-ray next instead of the 1st one. At least the 1st one is widescreen. I can deal with the DVD version. It was done well. The 3rd one by Artisan is a bare bones full screen release of the film. Really lazy effort from Artisan which released a lot of bombs on DVD such as Prom Night 3 & 4 Double pack and Fright Night 2 (1988). If you like this movie, grab it quick before it goes out of print. Before this Blu-ray & DVD release of this movie, this film could only be obtainable on VHS, and tracking a perfect VHS copy is difficult to find. I definitely recommend skipping that and shelling a few bucks more out and get the Blu-ray version. It's definitely worth it.",1383350400,2,1242,4.11522633744856
526018,5,6302897386,I seen this movie on youtube and actually watched it all the way through which is hard to do when you're viewing it on a 52 inch with the worst picture quality imaginable.

526019,4,6302897386,"A beautiful young woman unlocks a passageway to pure evil in the spine-tingling supernatural sequel to the popular hit, Witchboard. When Paige Benedict (Ami Dolenz, Ticks, She's Out of Control) moves into her new artist's loft, the only thing on her mind is her art and her slightly loopy landlady Elaine (Laraine Newman, Saturday Night Live). But when she finds an old Ouija board buried in her closet, she discovers that this new apartment isn't hers at all. Through the board, Paige in contacted by the spirit of a former tenant who claims she was murdered there. Against the advice of her ex-boyfriend Mitch (Timothy Gibbs, The Kindred), Paige is drawn deeper into the mystery as she finds her dreams overtaken with vivid, erotic and brutal visions of unspeakable horror. And when other tenants in the building begin falling prey to violent, mysterious deaths, Paige realizes that only she can seal the door to the terrifying nightmare she has unwittingly unleashed and the price may be her soul. Stylishly directed by horror veteran Kevin S. Tenney (Night of the Demons).

Witchboard 2 is the first release of the film on DVD or Blu-ray! The Blu-ray sports great picture and audio quality. Starring the beautiful Ami Dolenz (Ferris Bueller's Day Off TV Series) who moves into a new building. She starts messing around with the ouija board from the first film and her life spins out of control. Witchboard 2 is remastered in HD and loaded with extras after a long wait. It isn't quite as memorable as the original but it does have its moments. Features cameos from the leads of the original cast too. Malfeitor was one of my favorite villains of all-time. He played it well but I wish we saw more of him (he only acted in 2 films and this sequel wasn't one of them). My only complaint is that the bonus supplements are fairly light.

526021,5,6302897386,"It is a great movie but it is kind of cursed for me.

Second Buyer returns it back and swears that it should be DVD and tells me that I have to give him/her full refund since it is not his fault and the movie was listed as DVD.

It is VHS listing, it is VHS tape, it requires VHS player - if you don't know - it a previous century device that plays a magnetic tape in a black box if you still know what it is. Please pay attention when buying that this is a VHS tape and i don't think it exists on DVD yet. Do not expect HDTV quality from this tape, remember that you couldn't skip scenes and you have to rewind the tape after watching.

Anyway it's basically more of the same here but done in a much better way, in my opinion of course. For a long time, these were the only Ouija movies available but now days there are plenty of them.
