4948944,5,B0064C4540,Really nice to live in winter country and be able to take a stroll on the beach.  Happy someone realizes we need this type of video to help with our workouts.,1327449600,2,158,4.096774193548387
4948945,5,B0064C4540,Just starting out and trying to be a runner.  Found that I got bored with-in minutes using the treadmill.  Purchased this DVD to help.  This is a GREAT DVD.  I find myself setting goals of running to the next landmark instead of just looking at the timer on the treadmill.  The video is very well done and the ocean sounds are very relaxing.  This DVD has helped me and will be with me as I train to complete my first 10K.,1327363200,5,422,4.148148148148148
4948946,4,B0064C4540,"Nice wide open spaces.  Some of the motion is a bit sideways, which takes some getting used to.  I like the peaceful steady pace and the ocean view along with the sounds of the waves.",1326585600,,183,4.2
4948947,2,B0064C4540,My disk came in the package but it was scratched.  I can't believe all the work someone goes to putting this disk together only to not secure it in the CD holder and now there is about 100 different scratches making in skip or pause sometimes. I think it is a good video but packaging is terrible.,1325548800,,297,4.2105263157894735
4948948,5,B0064C4540,I loved the jungles and beaches in the other Scenic Trex videos and the Southern California Beaches DVD is more of the same!  Beautiful scenery and the sound of the crashing waves and seagulls take me out of my gym and really make me feel like I'm exercising outdoors.  Thanks Scenic Trex keep making these great DVDs!,1325116800,2,318,4.56140350877193
4948949,5,B0064C4540,"I was so excited to see a new title from Scenic Trex - I love the last two videos and couldn't wait to order the newest.  Although I live in Southern California, I don't get to the beaches as much as I'd like during the winter months.  With long work hours and short days I miss jogging on the beach durning this time of year - now I can jog and enjoy the beach no matter what time of day or weather.

Thank you, Scenic Trex, for making my treadmill workout something I look forward to.",1321833600,4,486,4.041666666666667
4948950,5,B0064C4540,The sound of the ocean helps put me in another state of mind. Relaxing and invigorating at the same time. Now I want to visit these beaches in person!,1321833600,,150,4.206896551724138
4948951,5,B0064C4540,"Its so nice to have great scenery, and NO COMMERCIALS! I get off the bike feeling like I had some peace, so much better than watching TV and the constant stream of ads.",1321142400,6,168,4.121212121212121
4948952,5,B0064C4540,"I absolutely love love love Southern California beaches! And this DVD captures their beauty, ruggedness and natural state perfectly. After a long day working in an office, I can come home (in the dark - ugh!) and be treated to a beach walk on my treadmill. Very zen and allows me to empty my brain from the day's events. Awesome!",1321142400,6,329,4.5
4948953,1,B0064C4540,"scenes  and views  are  very, very  poor  and  no clarity  to none  and , without  color.

4948954,5,B0064C4540,I get to be by the beach and not even be there.,1408320000,,47,3.0
4948955,5,B0064C4540,Good dvd. Fast shipping. Just like running on the beach - the camera even turns occasionally to look at something just as you would if you were there.,1407888000,,150,4.392857142857143
4948956,5,B0064C4540,"If you have to exercise, you may as well enjoy it. I love the beach, so this DVD is right up my alley. Some will say it is just beach after beach. And it is. But for a reluctant exerciser who is landlocked, this DVD is perfect. I got a great workout, and it seemed the time went by very quickly. The last part was a sunset at the beach scene, which was also nice for a cool down. I will use this DVD often.",1401926400,,406,3.788235294117647
4948957,1,B0064C4540,"Stopped during playing, froze up. Horrible shaking of the camera when it played. Returned and refunded quickly that was the best part of the experience.",1399939200,,152,5.12
4948958,3,B0064C4540,"I have lived in various parts of southern California and spent considerable time on beaches, particularly in the San Diego area.  When I ordered this DVD I was perhaps unconsciously expecting a virtual walk-through of the beaches I knew and loved.

While the beaches shown in the video were pretty overall, there were lots of rocks --- hard on the feet! --- and an overall sense of coldness, as if the video had been shot in the early morning before the sun was fully up or before the fog completely burned off.

Or because the beaches were rocky as noted above, perhaps shot in winter when the sun is low in the sky and the shifting tides tends to pull the sand into the water, exposing the rocks.",1397001600,,698,4.4375
4948959,5,B0064C4540,"Enjoyed seeing the beautiful beaches and the 30"" I spent on my treadmill flew past! Great for those of us stuck inside our houses during the long cold winter!",1396742400,,158,4.482758620689655
4948960,5,B0064C4540,"I love to walk the beaches in FL and TX. and this was great. To clarify some of the negative reviews I saw.

Too much civilization: This is southern California. There are 10 beaches, I think, the names are up for such a short time if you are wiping your face you could miss one, Most of the beaches have foot prints in the sand where someone else walked the beach. The first beach is along a highway and for a couple seconds you see cars. One beach as a guy on a bike. he is seen for such a short time I miss him more times then I see him. One beach has some surfers and you see the Santa Monica pier in the distance when you run along the Santa Monica Beach, but cut away to the next beach before you get there.

It is fluffy and out of focus. I don't know if you have ever walked on the beach, but there is always a mist. Most of the walks were filmed in the early morning and you see the morning ocean fog.",1396051200,7,909,3.881720430107527
4948961,2,B0064C4540,"The video is a film of a walk along various beaches. The camera is focused straight ahead at a distant point, which gradually comes closer as the cameraman walks along the beach. That's about all the action. The scenery is nice but one soon gets tired of the sameness.",1393027200,,268,4.489795918367347
4948962,2,B0064C4540,"All of the Scenic Trex video are murky, low qualityand not at all comparable
to the one I have gotten from Virtual Walks. Be assured that I will not buy any others!!!",1377043200,,166,4.21875
4948963,2,B0064C4540,"This is a video filmed from someone walking on the beach.  Has the sounds of ocean waves.  Nothing more.  I was hoping for some kind of walking music, or any kind of music to inspire a good walk.  Not happening, got bored after two minutes.  It did show the approach to the Santa Monica Pier, and I was getting hopeful of at least having some sounds from the pier and actually seeing the pier, since it has been years since I've seen it....but just as I got closer to the pier, the scenery suddenly changed to a different boring beach.  Oh we'll, too bad I've already taken the cellophane off the second DVD that I ordered with this one....live and learn. ",1376265600,,656,4.371900826446281
4948964,3,B0064C4540,"I bought this in an attempt to bring the virtual reality experience to my use if my elliptical trainer. I set up my TV infront of it on the cheap - 16 inch screen. I have Sennheiser wireless headphones but I haven't found the sound output to me TV. But that's OK since I DO have 315 hours of MP3 music available to my headphones. For these tapes to be more Virtual I need a 110"" screen and theater speakers!!! So the tapes are - OK.",1374278400,,432,4.034883720930233
4948965,2,B0064C4540,"Scenic Trex certainly fills a need for those who abhor treadmill/elliptical workouts while staring into space or zoning out in a state of mental neutrality.  It's so very helpful to have visuals like this to help ""motivate"" through the minutes and miles.

Now, I have been trying out various producers of these videos.  I opted to go this route because of some serious technical issues with an internet-based Individualized FITness program built into the elliptical I recently purchased.  The program costs $100 per year and, in theory, is the ""cat's meow"" of interactivity.  Alas....the revised/""upgraded"" software for 2013 crashed and burned in November 2012 upsetting untold numbers of purchasers.  I didn't buy that program.  Enter the ""backup plan"" - exercise DVDs.

If you haven't tried various producers of these types of DVDs, this review may not make complete sense, but I am writing this from a ""comparative"" perspective...albeit without naming the other producers specifically.

ST SoCal Beaches is pretty much a mundane run along light gray sand, dark gray rocks, and beachside cliffs.  It then switches to another beach location....turning into tan sand, gray rocks, and beachside cliffs.  A few more of the same transitions and ...that's it.  Now, if THAT's all you want - because you are a beach runner - this DVD will indeed trip your trigger.  Otherwise, I find it VERY boring, monotonous, and non-motivating. Sure, nice beach sounds....but nothing but beach....quiet, lonely, deserted shoreline.  For me...I couldn't wait for my workout session to end and put this DVD back on the shelf... for the NEXT time I just want a mind-neutralizing run with nothing but ocean crashing.  It beats staring at a blank wall or a digital readout...that's for sure.  However, I see this as a C-level (pun intended) attempt at a virtual workout.  Not A-level, or even B.

If you really are looking for variation in scenery/surroundings, actual motivation through your exercise period, and the option of music/soundtrack to help with your cadence or pace, Scenic Trex is NOT it.  At least for me.  Look for a more ""active"" approach to a ""virtual"" outdoor workouts by putting these two keywords in your Amazon or other search and you will likely arrive at my top pick for this exercise medium.",1366416000,,2293,5.080213903743315
4948966,5,B0064C4540,The video production and sound is great.  It is exactly as advertised as a trip jogging on beaches and makes you feel like you are there.,1361145600,2,137,4.269230769230769
4948967,5,B0064C4540,"I would recommend this product to anyone! I absolutely LOVE all 3 DVD's that I purchased. One in particular - the Jungle/Beach Side one, because it reminds me so much of the State Park we used to hike in when we went camping in Door County, WI. I'm 77 now so don't do much hiking anymore, but this makes me feel like I'm actually there. Really, I feel 20yrs younger! And I  used to do just 15min at a time on my treadmill. Now I'm doing 30min at a time, just because it's so much fun!  I just change (in my mind) the palm trees to our local type of forest trees. I just cannot say enough good things about all 3 of the DVD's The Calif beaches is also very  interesting. And today I used the Rainforest one - great. It's something that actually has to be experienced. I don't go very fast, but that doesn't make any difference. I want to really enjoy the scenery. Best thing I've done in a long time!",1359849600,10,899,4.1257142857142854
4948968,3,B0064C4540,Nice video to walk to. Kinda slow and boring. I kept wishing for some other stimulus but it didn't happen. But if you need peace and quiet from peace and quiet this will do it.,1358726400,,176,4.057142857142857
4948969,3,B0064C4540,"I think they could have put some relaxing music in the DVD, It's OK ,but some music would make it better  !!!!",1357862400,2,110,4.0
4948970,2,B0064C4540,I lived in CA for 15 years and visited many of the Beaches in CA. In that aspect it was nice to revisit some of them. The things I did not like about this DVD are this: the 1st 2 beach scenes take up most of this video and they are endlessly boring. It gets a lot better after the 1st 2 beaches. Manhatten Beach would have been a lot more interesting if they had kept the boardwalk and the houses in sight. It gives more a feel of travel when you can actually see the sights as well as the beach.,1354492800,2,496,3.872549019607843
4948971,4,B0064C4540,"Bought these DVD as a way to give more scenery to my morning Eliptical workout.
That it did indeed. THis is my 3rd month using the DVD. It feels more like 1/3rd
the time. I was able to make the whole 52 min run after just a few days.
I have lost several inches already, the weight is coming off too.
I find that exercising more than 4 days a week tends to make me more sore, this irratates the wife cause she likes the dance time with me. Soo I Alternate between the gym and the DVD excercise.
I hung a 42 inch Flatscreen in my garage. This is where I excercise in the morning.
Neighbors are feeling quilty.
On a different note.... The Dvd resolution quality is SD at best. It was shoot using a stabilizing device and most likely a 3 chip camera. I would absolutely pay more for one filmed in Hd. Preferably from this same seller.
I also purchased the Journey scene thru the redwood forest DVD (Different vendor)... awesome change of scenery... and again, I would pay more for an HD Version.
Hope this helps",1346025600,12,1007,4.277486910994765
4948972,5,B0064C4540,"Very nice way to enjoy California's gorgeous beaches while getting some walking exercise and/or relaxation. There are better choices for running or cycling. This DVD doesn't include instruction or hints on walking. It's just beautiful scenery that seems as if the viewer is moving forward, at a nice walking speed. Very realistic.

I love the beaches in Southern California. It would be so much fun to just start out at one end and run or walk to the other, if that were possible in my life. This video has the advantages of the beauty of the beaches, including the sounds of waves, birds, etc., and practicality. Most of us don't have a beach waiting for us when we are in the mood to walk on one.

As far as exercise is concerned, the speed was more 'Walk' than 'Run', which was fine for me. I had just completed a very strenuous workout and wanted to just enjoy some beautiful scenery, but I wasn't quite finished working out for the day. This was ideal.

After I finished, I brought the DVD downstairs so I can play it while I do some reading, just for background ambiance. In addition to enjoying walking on the beach, I've always wanted to have the sort of life where I could just walk out my front door, pull up a beach chair, and read, with the sound of the waves and seagulls to relax me.

The DVD is called a '52-minute trek' with BONUS Morning Warm-Up and sunset Cool-Down.

The beaches are so real that it does make me feel as if I were there in person. I looked at one of the rocky beaches and remembered how it felt to walk on that same beach. Some of my favorite beaches are there. Ahhhh! Very nice. I'll enjoy using this for exercise, virtual travel, AND exercise motivation.

Surprisingly enough, I brought the DVD down and started reading it, using the sound in the background and glancing up occasionally to see the beautiful ocean and beach. Then I thought I would just see what it was like to just walk along with it, not with my exercise equipment, but just there in the middle of the living room.

I kept walking and walking and walking.

I could almost feel my feet on the sand, the warm sunshine and soft sea breeze. I have lots of ocean DVDs, but I've never really felt the urge to walk with them through it. It has exercise potential.",1329004800,2,2261,4.405275779376499

It seems like a mini-vacation...the sounds are really lifelike and the scenery is so pretty.  I feel like i am actually walking on the beautiful California beaches without ever leaving my home and I live hundreds of miles away!  I don't know how they do it but picture is very smooth, not shaky or anything.  I've been to the California coast before and it feels like i get to revisit it every time I workout.
