8743384,4,B018YIIXX0,"This is a fun little Christmas movie. Santa gets tired of always having to help everyone else and starts to complain. This makes him magically split into two people. Santa, the guy we all know, and Claus, a jet setting jerk. Sort of like when Steve Urkel turned into Stefan on Family Matters. A little girl, with the help of some fairies, tries to get Santa back together. Trying to stop her is a real douche named Vladimir Dragonoff. I won't spoil anything else in case you haven't seen the movie yet.

I caught this movie a few years ago and loved it. The next year, I taped it off of tv (yes, I still used VHS up until a few years ago.) Unfortunately, my vcr mangled and broke the tape when it was dumping out on me. Ever since, I've been hoping they'd show the movie on tv again....but they never have since. Not long ago, I was doing an internet search, hoping to find the movie online somewhere to watch, but couldn't find it. Through the youtube page for it, I saw that it was for sale on amazon. I couldn't believe it and ordered it right away.

The movie is a lot of fun, especially if you enjoy the similar animated movie, Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer.",1452988800,,1168,4.256756756756757
