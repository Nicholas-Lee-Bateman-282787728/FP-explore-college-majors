2448141,5,B000BYRCCY,"My son loves Dora, Diego, and like all little boys he also likes dinosaurs. So the gift of a Diego movie with dinosaurs simply thrilled him. We sing & dance along. I wish there were more Diego DVDs.",1157068800,2,198,4.2368421052631575
2448142,5,B000BYRCCY,"My kids love the video.  My [...] stomps, jumps and claps with Dora, Diego and Alicia.  They love animals and dinosaurs so this video is perfect for them.  They are big Dora and Diego fans!",1147910400,,189,4.3428571428571425
2448143,5,B000BYRCCY,"This is a great dvd.  Our daughter really loved it!  She really loves Diego beacuse he is an animal rescuer!  This dvd introduced her to dinosaurs.  It introduced the dinosaurs in a gentle way that wasn't too scary for a toddler and give them a nice place to start to learn about the dinosaurs.  It has inspired my daughter to learn more about the different types of dinosaurs.  Sometimes, the dinosaurs are portrayed as scary to a toddler. The music is nice-a little too much for mommy-but, my daughter liked to dance to it when it was on.  The other eposides are ones that have been already aired.  But, they are perfect for the Go Diego Go addict.  Also, the dinosaur episode also features Dora & Diego's sister, Alicia (who is my daughter's favourite).  It has a little something for everyone.  As for the going back in time, my daughter sees it as imagination & pretend.  So, that part didn't bother her.

Basically, it is a great buy for any Diego lover.  The bonus is the introduction into learning about dinosaurs!",1146096000,8,1022,4.574585635359116
2448144,3,B000BYRCCY,"We've been waiting for this DVD every since the show came out on NickJr, and I'm a little bit disappointed with the Dinosaur episode.  The bonus episodes are comparable to the ones on TV, but my children also found something not quite right about the Great Dinosaur Rescue.  My son struggled with how they could jump into a book and see animals that are extinct... time on this scale is a difficult concept for toddlers and preschoolers, and mine both found this confusing.

I try to watch the DVD's with my kids, and this one I couldn't make it through... singing, dancing, cuddly, eye-lash batting dinosaurs were more than I could watch, at least for this long.  The way that Diego and Alicia interact with the kids is also a little strained compared to Dora episodes.

The regular length episodes were fine and my kids love them. Very catchy songs and the kids love learning about the animals.  The bonus poster is great too. Overall, worth the money.",1141344000,23,954,4.648809523809524
2448145,5,B000BYRCCY,My 3 year old used to be addicted to Dora but the show just doesn't seem to entertain her as much any more so we were glad to see Go Diego Go come to Nick Jr. She loves to learn about the animals he rescues and enjoys the new songs and games.  She doesn't know yet that the DVD is on it's way to her but she will be excited when it gets here!,1141344000,2,342,3.6216216216216215
2448146,5,B000BYRCCY,"My daughter is almost 4, and has been watching Dora for more than 2 years now. She still likes them, but I think that they don't entertain her or teach her as much as they used to. They're all very similar, which just gets very repetitive and eventually boring and/or annoying. After she saw the first Go Diego episode on tv, she constantly asked to watch it again, so we were overjoyed when the dvd came out. She loves Diego and baby jaguar, and learning about all the animals. What I like best about it is he actually TEACHES FACTS about the animals he rescues, like what they eat, where they live, and what they do. It's like a science lesson disguised as a cartoon. Also what I like about Diego more than Dora is that in the end they don't just go over what they did and where they went, but instead reviews the animal facts that they learned in the form of a game. And they're learning a variety of facts about a variety of animals, rather than the same counting games and fit the shapes games over and over again. Also, every young child likes shows about animals, but most little boys aren't really interested in shows about becoming a princess or taking care of babies or dancing. The morals are still very good, but the audience is more limited. However, all of your young children will enjoy watching this together.",1141084800,,1325,4.434426229508197
2448147,5,B000BYRCCY,Both of my children (girl-2yrs and boy- 3yrs) were captivated by this DVD.  I love hearing them interact with their cartoons instead of mindlessly watching the screen.  Both my son and daughter could be heard answering Diego and singing from the other side of the house! Great DVD and a wonderful addition for mothers of boys!,1141084800,15,326,4.803571428571429
2448148,4,B000BYRCCY,"My boys (2 and 5) like Dora and love Diego on TV, so I figured I'd get this to get some episodes off of our PVR. The double length Dino episode is OK, but didn't capture their attention as the regular episodes do. Strange, given that they do enjoy the longer Dora episodes.",1140566400,12,273,4.169811320754717

2448174,3,B000BYRCCY,"I bought these for my grandson to watch when I pick him up at the babysitters to take him home with me. He likes Diego, Dora, and curious George, so after I put him in the car seat I have to ask which video do you want to watch and most of the time he chooses Diego.",1388707200,,266,3.6842105263157894

2448191,5,B000BYRCCY,"My little grandson loves this dvd, diego and dora are two of his favorites.  DVD was great quality, very satisfied.",1362182400,,115,4.75
2448192,5,B000BYRCCY,This was a great addition to our DVD collection. Diego is a perfect change from Dora and I find both of my girls (3 years and 2 years) like learning about animals. The running time is about an hour and a half and it plays about four episodes.,1358121600,,242,4.0625
2448193,5,B000BYRCCY,"This disc has three episodes on it, or maybe it's one movie and 2 episodes. Either way, we have enjoyed watching the show while having a limit to how much is watched. For $8, it was worth it for us. That way we didn't have to pay a lot of money for either just one episode or for a ton of episodes.",1356480000,,298,3.8225806451612905
2448194,5,B000BYRCCY,This is most definately good for car rides with the little ones of the family can keep them distracted or just sitting at home if they want to watch it a great pick,1356307200,,164,4.0
2448195,4,B000BYRCCY,If the kids love Dora chances are they love diego. My youngest thinks Diego is great and choses this disc to watch alot.,1355356800,,120,4.260869565217392
2448196,5,B000BYRCCY,"Both of my sons (age 6 and 2) like this video.  I find the Diego series fun, educational and the perfect video length to keep my boys engaged. I really like the way Diego engages the audience to participate with him on the adventure.",1354752000,,233,4.295454545454546
2448197,5,B000BYRCCY,"This is by far my favorite Diego video and I'll gladly watch it 100 times more. In this video Diego ventures back to the land of the Dinosaurs to help the 'Myasaura' Whilst him and his rescuers are there they get to sing act like a dinosaur to a catchy tune that goes something like this:

come help us explore we wanna learn more about the dinosaurs.....
then the beat changes and they say  ""stomp like a dinosaur"" my 2 year old will stand up and stomp to the beat
Then they say ""now jump like a dinosaur"" he will then start jumping like they do in the video and finally
they say ""Lets all ROAR!"" and he will hold up his little hands and give a big ""ROAR"" the way they do in the video and by this time I'm laughing my head off cause of the cuteness.

No problems playing video in any of my players.",1328400000,,799,4.044303797468355
2448198,5,B000BYRCCY,"Another great Go Diego Go movie! My daughter loves this DVD so much, she takes it wherever we go! Worth adding to your collection!",1318204800,,130,4.458333333333333

2448200,5,B000BYRCCY,"Like most children's videos, it can really get on your last nerves--especially when your child LOVES it!  My 2 year-old little girl LOVES dinosaurs, so I thought I'd get this video for her.  She loves Dora and Diego.  It's a good combo of everything she enjoys.  It also helps mommy out to keep her occupied/entertained when I have things to do around the house.",1293926400,,362,4.609375
2448201,5,B000BYRCCY,"There couldn't be a better combination for my son then Diego and Dinosaurs! He love the dinosaur show. It is longer than most, maybe around 40 minutes, but it definitely holds his attention.",1293926400,,190,4.787878787878788
2448202,5,B000BYRCCY,"My 3 year old Grandson loves to watch Diego but Diego movies are very hard to find. This one was a good price and my Grandson watches it over and over, so it has his seal of approval.",1292284800,,183,3.8421052631578947
2448203,5,B000BYRCCY,I looked in all the local stores for this tape and could not find it at a reasonable price. My four year old loves dinosaurs and he loves Diego. When he saw this tape for Christmas it made his day. The seller had this tape to me in no time and I can say I have really gotten what I paid for.,1265414400,,291,3.7096774193548385

2448207,5,B000BYRCCY,This is a wonderful episode!  My son sits and watches it and loves it.  He loves to interact with the characters.  If you have a kid that loves dinosaurs and Diego this would be perfect for them!,1251590400,,195,4.216216216216216

2448220,3,B000BYRCCY,"Why would I buy a Special Ed. when there's no information in the review
to suggest that this DVD is any different from the original - which happens to be cheaper. Am I missing something? Or is it just that people
are so willing to have the newest product that they don't give a thought to what they're buying. I'm all for Special Editions - but only when they offer something special!",1236729600,2,384,4.347222222222222
2448221,5,B000BYRCCY,"This movie is played at least 2x in a row at home for my 2.5 yr old boy. He loves Diego as well as dinosaurs so this movie is definitely a perfect match. He's learning a lot and at the same time allows me to do several chores while he's watching it! The movie talks about different dinosaurs, exercises problem-solving, critical thinking for tots, as well counting (in Spanish). It is sure worth every penny!!",1231632000,6,409,4.466666666666667
2448222,5,B000BYRCCY,I love how much my kids learn from Diego.  My two year old knows his dinosaurs and loves this movie.  Would recommend.,1231459200,,118,4.318181818181818

2448228,5,B000BYRCCY,"My 3-year-old twins love Diego.  I believe that the tree frogs episode is their all time favorite episode, and it is a bonus on this DVD, so I bought them this DVD.

2448241,5,B000BYRCCY,"My 2 year old son is enjoying this interactive dvd. The content prompts the toddler to respond via words and actions rather than just passively watching the visual content.
