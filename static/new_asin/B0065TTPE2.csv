4961476,4,B0065TTPE2,"I watched Playful Kiss on Hulu and I was really bored with the opening day dreaming scene. In fact I stopped watching it for that reason. But a week or so later, I was in the mood to see a romance, and because of the title, I  went back to it, fast forwarding over those stupid dream scenes. Because I did this, I really enjoyed the series and watched it about two or three times. I loved the high school setting, the mother, the kid brother, the girl's two best friends, and of course, the two main characters. Later, after the faithful hopeless male friend, finally stopped looking like a weirdo and became skillful in something, I liked him, too. He was actually a better person than the sophisticated, good looking, prodigy teenager. I can't help but think, that what helped the main guy realize his feelings for the girl, was that his competitor was going to win the prize. It was annoying that he never verbally admitted his feelings or apologized for his cold treatment of her. I love this drama, even with it's shortcomings. Oh yeah, I wonder if anyone will agree with me, that most of the kissing scenes were lame and unrealistic. With all of those raging teenage hormones, the jealous anger, and the adorable teenage girl in those short skirts, I would have expected to see some passion from the main guy, at least. And as a personal preference, I would have enjoyed seeing the girl continuing on with the spunky attitude she started with. The drama was really good, even if the embarrassing scenes were a little excruciating to watch, and the girl wasn't as smart as she should be. I definitely can recommend this to anyone interested in a romantic comedy. Lots of laughs.

By the way, I typed in Naughty Kiss on youtube and it had more scenes in it, but the version I saw, didn't have English subtitles. I wish they had included them. It would be nice to see more scenes of the main male character interact with the main female character, before they became a couple.",1360972800,,1979,4.540616246498599

4961478,5,B0065TTPE2,"At first, I thought the first scene its a bit boring but as the episode progress it keeps you wanting to watch and waiting what will happen. The story is abt a clumsy but cute girl Oh Ha Ni who had a very big crush with the ever genius and good looking Baek Sung Jo. Oh Ha Ni tried her best to be near Baek Sung Jo, almost to the point that she has no pride left. But you could tell that Baek Sung Jo struggles for his feeling towards her since he could not admit nor confirm his feelings for Oh Ha Ni. The story is sweet, makes you linger for more, and takes you back the time you were in highschool/college. I must admit that Im so smitten by the story since its given me a new perspective that we should not ever give up. Ive watched twice already and yet I still get the same giddy feeling. I highly recommend this!",1353974400,6,819,4.0
4961479,4,B0065TTPE2,"Synopsis:

Playful Kiss is based on the Japanese sh'jo manga, Itazura Na Kiss.
Oh Ha Ni is a sweet lively and happy high school student yet she is definitely not the smartest student at her school.
She has a crush on Baek Seung Jo, the smartest boy in school despite being chased loyally by Bong Joon Gu herself. When she confesses to Seung Jo through a letter, he brings it back to her, after grading it harshly and commenting that he hates stupid girls.
When Oh Ha Ni's new house suddenly collapses her father's friend offers for him and Ha Ni to stay with them. But Oh Ha Ni dosent know that her father's friend is actually Baek Seung Jo's dad.
As they continue to live under the same roof and attend Parang University together, Ha Ni continues to show affection for Seung Jo although he seems to be more interested in the equally clever and beautiful Yoon Hae Ra.
Following Ha Ni's many efforts, Seung Jo finally falls for her in a romantic and protective way.
The drama continues to show the young couple marry and go on to a pretty disasterous honeymoon.

Product: this DVD came in a very nice quality box, and says Naughty kiss on it. The box is also very colorful and cute with lots of pictures. When you open the box, there are 4 different disks inside. Each disk has a picture of one of the main characters on the front. The reason I give it 4 stars is, because the grammar on the subtitles are incorrect. You can still understand everything on it. The netflix subtitles were much better than the dvds. Overall, This is the funniest cutest love story I have ever watched!",1344384000,8,1581,4.429553264604811
4961480,3,B0065TTPE2,This isn't the best of the dramas. The main female lead (Oh Ha Ni) is very annoying at times. I find it disheartening that she continuously goes after Seung Jo when he shows her no interest. I really dislike the continued portrayal of the bad guy winning (Baek Seung Jo) and the good guy losing (Bong Joon Gu).,1342483200,7,310,4.362068965517241
4961481,2,B0065TTPE2,"I am a big fan of romantic comedies and novellas, but this one is way, way, way too corny and unrealistic.  I don't find it charming that Oh Ha Ni is after a guy that doesn't seem to like her very much and treats her terribly for his own amusement.  Especially, when a hard working man like Bong Joon Gu is genuinely vying for her attention.  Sure, Bong Joon Gu isn't the smartest guy, nor is he the best looking guy (with the strange hair style), but he seems to really love Oh Ha Ni regardless of whether she deserves it or not.  And watching Oh Ha Ni desperately try to win Baek Seung Jo's attention and affection is painful to watch: mainly because I keep face-palming myself at the ridculousness of it all.

Since I'm a stubbon fan of Korean-novellas, I did watch the entire series through with a hope that Oh Ha Ni will become a woman with more gumption and show Baek Seung Jo that she deserves his respect as his equal.  Unfortunately for me, that didn't happen; she will be the perfect desperate housewife, though.  Still, I must say the reason why I didn't give this series one star is because I was happy that Bong Joon Gu ended up with someone he deserved in the end.

Bottom line is, cuteness (Oh Ha Ni) and arrogance (Baek Seung Jo) can get annoying when each episode is the same, predictable routine.  I suggest looking for a series where the leading female character has more self-respect and the leading male character has less of an ego because a realistic relationship doesn't work when the two parts of a couple lacks respect for each other, or when each person's pride gets in the way.",1341878400,6,1605,4.4135593220338984
4961482,5,B0065TTPE2,"I totally fell in love with this drama, it is romantic and funny. Kym Hyun Joong is amazing in this drama.",1337990400,9,106,4.095238095238095
4961483,4,B0065TTPE2,"I decided to watch this drama because of Kim Hyun Joong who also starred in Boys Over Flowers. It was certainly a different experience to watch him play a character who is described as cold and uncaring in this drama. It is definitely entertaining to watch. A brief synopsis: Oh Ha Ni is a girl who has crush on Baek Seung Jo (the high school genius). It basically begins when she summons up the courage to leave him a love letter. He in turn, gives it back to her... with various corrections to her spelling and grammer. He then tells her that he hates stupid girls. You'd think that after that terrible experience Oh HaNi would give up however she continues on her quest to capture his interest by means of sticking to him like glue any chance she gets. To the dismay of Baek Seung Jo, HaNi ends up living with him and his family after Oh HaNi's house collapses. The reason is that SeungJo and HaNi's fathers are long time friends. It is fun to watch as this drama unfolds. You can't always guess what the genius Baek Seung Jo thinks of HaNi as he pretty much treats her like crap. He treats her so badly that you think she would give him up and that is what makes this series entertaining because she keeps trying.",1336089600,20,1217,4.342105263157895

4961493,4,B0065TTPE2,"In PLAYFUL KISS, directors Hwang In-roi and Kim Do-hyung unfold a vision of Korean light romantic comedy that represents a daunting challenge for a Western reviewer. The cinematic universe of such comedy is totally unlike its Hollywood counterpart. The conventions of one do not align neatly with the other. The only solution for a non-Korean reviewer such as myself is to judge it as a Korean might, a task replete with a swath of linguistic, social, psychological, and familial obstacles.

  To begin, one must distinguish Korean light romantic comedy from serious romantic drama. The latter has serious real world overtones that potentially intrude with near-tragic consequences. There may be romance at the core but this romance sputters as it fights for existence. The former lives in a fairy tale world of stasis. The evil of serious romantic drama is here emasculated, often emerging as a one-dimensional stick figure of pompous non-proportion. The only evil lies in overblown competitors for romance--the jealous boyfriend or the dejected girlfriend, both of whom exist as no more threatening than Snidely Whiplash. Then there are the romantic leads. The male is tall, model-slim, imperially good looking, arrogantly cool, and treats the female lead with undisguised contempt. He is most often the scion of a fabulously wealthy family, a Chaebol. The female is pretty without being beautiful. She loves the male lead with a ferocity that makes you question her basic motivation. She is upbeat, determined to win his love, and is from the lower end of the social spectrum. During the course of the series, the lovers meet, bicker, grow close, drift apart, then unite in the last episode. What Western audiences find astounding is the titillating focus on the absence of sex. The leads spend nearly the entire run holding hands but rarely engaging in kissing, hence the inner meaning of the title. The female has her sidekicks, a pretty one and a goofily unattractive one, both of whom offer welcome advice on how to Snag a Man. The male has sidekicks as well, usually from a similar socio-economic level as his. There are would be lovers for both. For the male, this nascent lover is his doppelganger, a female cosmically gorgeous, Trump rich, and witty in an Oscar Wilde fashion. For the female, this suitor is not overly bright, not especially handsome, nor financially stable. And surrounding all of these romantic entanglements is the usual focus on the Asian virtues of familial piety, industriousness, and respect for one's elders.

  With PLAYFUL KISS, Oh Ha-ni (Jung So-min) is a high school senior girl who has long loved the cool, rich, and genius Baek Seung-jo (Kim Hyun-joon).  She finally reveals her feelings in a love letter that he promptly reads aloud to the vast amusement of their peers. She is crushed, of course, but does she abandon her dreams of connubial bliss? Not a chance. In fact she becomes more dogged than ever. Eventually, when her house is destroyed in an earthquake, she and her family move into his house since his mother wants them to marry. The majority of the sixteen episode series details the specifics of how Oh Ha-ni and Baek Seung-jo eventually unite. They seem an oddly matched pair, differing in every way imaginable. Korean audiences clearly prefer their light romantic leads not only to be cool and tall, but also asexual. Baek Seung-jo has numerous opportunities to get physical with Oh Ha-ni, who is the clear sexual aggressor, and in one cringe-worthy scene they sleep in the same bed with absolutely nothing happening under the sheets. The supporting cast is stellar, especially a rival for the affections of Baek Seung-jo, a tall and equally model type Yoon Hae-ra (Lee Si-young) who uses her feminine wiles in a vain attempt to lure a man immune to such wiles.  PLAYFUL KISS emerges as a surprisingly engaging and entertaining vision of a culture that prizes love, honesty, and fortitude as much as does Hollywood even if it takes a vastly different approach to those qualities.",1453593600,4,4038,5.007451564828614

I couldn't like or respect either of the main characters in real life, but I somehow went with it and enjoyed the emotional roller coaster.  I actually had an uncle a little like Baek Seong Jo.  He was EXTREMELY handsome and very smart, but had a remote and rigid personality.  His first wife divorced him in under 6 months.  His second wife, my aunt, absolutely ADORED him her entire life.  I've wondered in recent years if maybe he had Aspberger's.  There was no understanding of that back in the day.  Back to the movie, I had to laugh at the flannel pajamas.  There are ways to protect the actors without going quite that extreme, but I guess Korean movies are especially chaste.",1431129600,5,748,4.522388059701493

The English subs are very literal and sometimes an idea is not expressed as well as it could be, but unless you want to learn Korean this is about as good as it gets and it's really pretty good! The characters are very well developed and it is very easy to get sucked in and spend the whole day watching! I highly recommend this series to any K-drama lovers out there, it is truly a one of a kind story experience.

Sometimes the stories, acting and subtitles are a bit off, however Asian films, for the most part, are solidly entertaining and offensive free.
