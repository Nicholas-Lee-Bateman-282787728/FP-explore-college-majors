8454143,1,B0052QG76S,"This movie seemed interesting the premise of a couple of escaped prisoners holding a family hostage in their own home along with a very creepy looking old house on the cover but alas despite being an '80's movie' it's rubbish.

 More thriller than horror the acting is very ordinary even by a cop who looked suspiciously like Christopher Knight from The Brady Bunch which in fact turned out to actually be him. The prison escapee brothers aren't all that convincing in their supposed aim to kill/threaten to kill anyone who played a part in their incarceration and there isn't much gore with most of the action happening off-screen.

 Curfew comes across as a low budget made for TV movie and despite the odd blast of cheesy synth in the score it's not worth bothering with.",1463702400,,774,4.711111111111111
