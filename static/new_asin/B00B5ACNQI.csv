5558159,3,B00B5ACNQI,"The usual BBC quality just isn't here . An annoying host,multiple high speed scenes,and a very dumbed down script.
There are some beautiful scenes but it feels like it was written for children. Underwater scenes of the narrator in scuba gear ,talking to the camera are very annoying.
 It's not unwatchable,but I have no desire to rewatch the shows.",1366416000,25,348,4.898305084745763
5558160,5,B00B5ACNQI,"The photography of this area is absolutely beautiful.  Monty Halls is our personal underwater guide who has been exploring the reef for 20 years.  He loves the area and his enthusiasm shines as he explains what we are seeing. There is an addditional narrator for the overall movie.  I love that we get a firsthand account and not a cold naration as some nature movies can be.  The movie is divided into 3 parts.  The reef itself; The 'desert' channel area between the reef and mainland; and finally, beyond the reef edge. Children who love the ""grose"" stuff will like part 2. The camera gives us so much detail: a shipwreck bursting with colorful life, Microscopic life of both coral and plankton, and the interaction of so many creatures living among the coral, on channel floor, and  beneath the mangroves. We are also shown Birds, crocodiles, snakes and 'lizards' turtles and sharks of course. The music and video are well choreographed and the color is bright and clear. The movie is mainly observation, very little opinion or evolution for those who are concerned with that. The one slight negative is that it is occasionally difficult to understand when Monty Halls talks underwater through his mask.  It doesn't happen that often and his comments are so brief that it is not distracting.  His enunciation is good and his volume is loud, but the slight muffling combined with the accent may make it difficult for some to understand him.  We are grateful for this beautiful presentation that allows us to view nature in a locale we are not able to visit personally. Overall time 185 minutes.",1365984000,13,1596,4.795620437956204

5558199,4,B00B5ACNQI,"I was expecting more footage of pretty fish and lots of coral and animals. There is a bunch, but just not very many close-up shots. There are a whole lot of high-speed, fast motion scenes, especially in the beginning, which seem gimmicky and take away from the beauty of the corals. There are a few zoomed in scenes of the narrator's face while he's talking which aren't very interesting, and quite off-putting. Did like it more, after the first half hour or so. It gets interesting further into the film.",1438300800,6,505,4.622222222222222

5558204,5,B00B5ACNQI,"I enjoyed watching this movie with the family. We purchased it on sale and it was something that I was able to sit down and watch with my 6 year old son. While we did not get through the entire documentary in one sitting the visuals were very impressive. The ""snorkle talking"" as other have mentioned was a little annoying however it was only a part of the video and there was a lot of more to this video than just that. All in all we enjoyed watching and learning some very interesting things with this video",1434672000,,509,4.257731958762887
5558205,4,B00B5ACNQI,"Excellent photography.

This film would be a solid five star production if it wasn't for the politically correct overtones dancing about climate change.  The authors would do well to seek more scientific data, or conversely touch on the real scientific dialog and allow intelligent viewers to form their own opinions.  Typical BBC approach to a not so subtle political agenda.

Lastly, a bit less anthropomorphic assignment would give this presentation a more professional aura.",1433980800,2,478,5.418918918918919

There is great photography here as well as animal life and the role it plays within the reef.

""Off the east coast of Australia, up to 200 km [124  miles] offshore, a line of surf rises out of the open ocean.  Beneath the surface, creating these breaking waves is the most magical marine environment on Earth.

I'm [your host and narrator], I'm a marine biologist and diver and I've always been fascinated by the sea.  For me, there's always been one place that is the epitome of everything that's wonderful about the marine environment.  It's a true global icon and is a Mecca for anyone who's ever heard of the word ""coral.""  The Great Barrier Reef.

Stretching for over 2000 km [1,240 miles] up the tropical coast of Australia, it is quite simply the largest living structure on the planet.  It's made up of almost 3000 different reefs, each one with a different personality.  And it's so much more than just coral.

But the Great Barrier Reef is most famous for its underwater world.  Here, there is more life than almost anywhere else on Earth.  Many of the creatures are exquisitely beautiful.  But some seem straight out of science fiction while others can kill in an instant.

And just when you think you know the reef, it changes, every second, every hour, every day, and every year.  It's a world of continual surprises.

This is the amazing story of an ever-changing natural miracle, the Great Barrier Reef!""

The above comes from the introduction of the first episode of this truly outstanding documentary.  The latest filming techniques are used and there is even some time-lapse photography.

The result is a well-narrated, vibrant-with-colour film showing everything you ever wanted about the Great Barrier Reef.  The biodiversity is just staggering!

There are three episodes.  Their titles are as follows:

(1) Nature's Miracle.  Examines the underwater world of the reef.
(2) Reef to Rainforest.  Looks at the marine habitats in and around the area of the reef.
(3) The Reef and Beyond.  Details why the Great Barrier Reef is an international hub to some of the greatest wildlife spectacles on Earth.

Finally, this is a show you must see with a widescreen TV--the wider, the better!!

In conclusion, this is your definitive guide to one of the most complex and spectacular ecosystems on Earth!!!

5558226,4,B00B5ACNQI,"Set of three documentaries on the Great Barrier Reef and its surroundings. The host is a bit off putting at times, but the cinematography is spectacular. An encounter with whales is the highlight of the trio.",1369699200,,208,4.805555555555555
5558227,4,B00B5ACNQI,"This is a solid production and was enjoyable to watch. I absolutely loved the time lapse sequences and there are some great underwater shots. I would say 4 stars and not five because it does not quite live up to the great Planet Earth, Africa, Frozen PLanet or Life but still worthy of being in your collection. I actually found the narrator refreshing and it cetrainly did not hurt the production at all. Overall there are not quite as many jaw dropping shots as seen before in the epic works. Highly recommended.",1368748800,6,514,4.5978260869565215
5558228,4,B00B5ACNQI,"The quality of the camera work and the incredible diversity of marine and shore life seen in this BBC video is world class, mostly in the same league as ""Planet Earth"" (2006) and in some ways better. The sheer profusion of life in the reef with the explosive dazzle of color and the graceful dance and sway of the sea creatures is mesmerizing.

The presentation by Monty Hall who narrates and stars is not the best however. His underwater vocals are garbled and his presence in some places is artificial and forced. He does look the part however, healthy and macho, and he even lives up to his namesake with a bit of slapstick when he gets sand thrown sharply in his face from a green turtle covering her clutch of eggs.

The DVD is 185 minutes long and I hardly noticed the time flying by until I got to the final sixty minutes or so. Here the focus is mostly on the green turtles that lay their eggs in the sands of Raine Island in the reef's Queensland National Park. This part of the show may be a bit unsettling for some viewers especially when some of the turtles can't get back to the sea and die in the hot sun or when the tiger sharks rip apart their corpses when they are later washed out to sea. It is also not fun to watch the baby turtles scrambling over the sand to the ocean only to be snapped up, desperately wriggling in the beak of a Rufous Night Heron.

The video also shows us a bit of the life ashore near the reef including some footage of the mangrove swamps; and there's some history of the reef and how the reef affects the Australian mainland. There are many surprises including tiny pink sea horses a centimeter long, a shrimp and a fish living symbiotically together, and sea snakes that live in the anus of sea cucumbers.

I'm looking forward to watching this again...well except for the last part about the green turtles.

5558230,1,B00B5ACNQI,This narrator sucks and I was so upset to see him just swimming around the reefs and blatantly harassing wildlife.

8562755,4,B00B5ACNQI,"The Great Barrier Reef is informative, the reef is dying, but not as fun as the BBC Natural History Collection series: The Life of Birds, The Blue Planet, The Life of Mammals, Planet Earth I and II. The History Channel's Universe series and the two Cosmos series are also good.

If the above don't sound interesting you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,1959,5.2492012779552715
8562756,5,B00B5ACNQI,"I am a sucker for well crafted nature videos.  My five year old, who is uninterested in the Blue Planet (Philistine!) ADORES this series.  I think it may be because Monty Halls appears in the video personally and may be more accessible than a narrator (not that it is aimed at children). The sea turtle sequences were particularly interesting.  I highly recommend this series.  I wish more Monty Halls videos were available in Region 1.",1518307200,2,436,4.773333333333333
