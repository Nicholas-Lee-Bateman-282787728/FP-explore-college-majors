8398519,5,6304570090,"Hungarian animated movies from the 80s and 90s were awesome!  The original title is Szaffi. Set during the Austro-Turkish wars, ""Treasure of Swamp Castle"" features a young man reclaiming his inheritance and finding true love. It includes quixotic characters like the general with the valve for releasing steam from his head, and some gypsy magic. The hero's moral and emotional growth is never overstated like American films of this ilk, perhaps because this tale like other Hungarian animated films were geared more toward adults than Hollywood products.",1355356800,,555,5.379310344827586
