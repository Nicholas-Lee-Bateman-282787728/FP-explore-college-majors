56260,4,0783226985,"52. DRAGON: the Bruce Lee story (action, 1993) A re-telling of the life of legendary martial-arts star Bruce Lee (played by Jason Scott Lee). From his brief childhood days in native Hong Kong to his days as a dishwasher,  martial-arts teacher and eventual cinema superstar in  Hollywood.
Critique: The life and death of Bruce Lee has inspired many a  film and documentaries since his time. Most of these accounts center around  Lee's `mysterious' death from a `brain edema'. They never develop anything  really new of interest, just speculations. Incredibly it has taken over 20  years for a film to finally put to rest the many theories and innuendoes.  ""Dragon"" is by far the best of the legendary Lee story not only for  omitting the many death scenarios but also for presenting an (almost)  accurate account of the man. Apart from the tasteful omissions the film  wouldn't have worked without Jason Scott Lee in the role of Lee. He gives a  spirited, charismatic performance that captures the zest for life that Lee  possessed. It's a long way from one of his first `extra' roles as an Asian  immigrant in the rather forgetful ""Born in East L.A."" (1988). Scott Lee is  totally appealing here, filling such a role and making us believe that Lee  is truly up there once again on the screen. The film's major theme of the  ""demon curse"" Lee's family was escaping from had a frighteningly real  resonance when after the movie opened Lee's eldest son, Brandon (for whom  the film is dedicated to), was accidentally killed on the set of ""The  Crow"". (The film that made him known world-wide, the same way Lee's last  film, ""Enter the Dragon"", made him a world star.) This gives the film an  added, prophetic note that puts it in a category all its own. Based on  Linda Lee Cadwell's book, ""Bruce Lee: the man only I knew"", directed with  skillful restraint by Rob Cohen (who also co-scripted). Randy Edelman  created the unforgettable musical score (you'll be humming the tune for  hours after seeing the movie).
QUOTES: Linda: ""All these years later  people still wonder about the way he died. I prefer to remember  the way he lived.""",920246400,2,2133,4.772602739726027
56261,4,0783226985,"Jason Scott Lee is wonderful as an imperfect, animated and likeable Bruce Lee.  I found the fight scenes well shot and exciting, though the story intrigued me more than anything.
As a child, Bruce's father sends him to  America as a final attempt at fooling a demon that haunts the males in  their family.  (He also gave Bruce a girl's name upon birth for the same  reason.)  Bruce is excited to be in America at first, but finds the bitter  racism and other blocks to opportunity disheartening as he makes some  immature mistakes in life.
Bruce's stubbornness, combined with his  willingness to teach martial arts to all races, finds him success as well  as enemies in the US.  Eventually, Bruce gets his break, and even seems to  conquer his demon.  We all know what the end has to be, but the movie does  a good job of not dwelling on it and uses extensive poetic liscense to  bring it about.
I loved it.",914198400,,907,4.478527607361963

56361,2,0783226985,"Works as a decent 90s martial arts movie. As a Bruce Lee biopic, leaves a lot to be desired. Overdramatized, extremely cheesy and shockingly inaccurate for a film that claims to have Linda Lees blessing. The most fun to be had are the faithfully recreated iconic sets from the original films. Jason Scott Lee is a good actor but sadly miscast and poorly directed into an ugly and unintentionally goofy caricature with none of Bruce Lees charm, grace and explosive power.

I kind of didn't like the corny sound effects during fight scenes though.. but it picked up in 2/4 of the way and after that it was an spectacular. Scary how the curse was real, this movie is all about the Lee family curse and the demon that ended his life... this is a true story and the Dragon tells this side of his history. Very scary, the demon took his son's life too, really telling scene when the Demon went after his son in a dream sequence. Ultimately during the filming of the Crow, Brandon Lee was struck down by a bullet that was lodged in a stage gun during the film.. Amazing and scary, just goes to show you how curses are real.

Very sad, but an amazing movie that will always be in my collection. This is one movie that I never get tired of watching over and over again.",1471910400,4,836,4.128834355828221

Not low budget, and it is a high quality film.

The movie starts with Bruce being sent to California, and then takes of from there. I don't remember
How Bruce dies which I am sure readers of this review would like to know.

The movie shows bruce getting into trouble with the Chinese community for teaching martial
Arts, since in those days it was not done - teaching westerners that is.

The movie is a human story and touching, since bruce hits a glass ceiling in America and decides to
Make movies in Asia.

A Great Movie!! - For some reason I just can't give it 5 Stars. - The actor Jason Scott Lee - is FANTASTIC!! I don't know much about Bruce Lee - so I can't compare this movie to other knowledge about Bruce. It's definitely Worth Seeing!! Thanks, Scott M.
p.s. - apparently - Bruce and Jason - are NOT  related (according to the internet)
Jason Scott lee did a GREAT acting job!!! - According to the DVD he was a gymnast - who had NO martial arts background!!
However - if you watch the movie WITH commentary - Much of this movie is NOT historically accurate! : (
Great for Entertainment - - but much is made up (beware!!) Scott M.",1436832000,,706,4.268656716417911

56683,4,0783226985,"I would love this film if it was more historically accurate. Aside from the fact that my Sifu, Jerry Poteet, trained Jason Scott Lee for months, how to move and look like Bruce Lee, I feel that the Bruce deserved something more authentic. I want to see a film that more based on his real life. I read something the other day, and I heard it years ago. Joe Lewis trained with Bruce and was asked how Bruce would do in MMA. Joe Lewis said he was too small and didn't have the mentality of a real professional fighter. He said Bruce was an amazing martial artist, but skills were more suited to sparring and exhibitions. I think there is so much ego and jealousy involved in the martial arts world, and anyone who gets well known is going to get criticized, rightfully or not. Bruce literally changed martial arts. His photos are still, to this day, the best sellers on the cover of Karate magazines, and his films are the most highly watched martial arts films in history. Back in the 70s like many others, I was Kung Fu crazy and would buy up anything about Bruce whether it was authentic or a fake. I paid to see ""Enter The Dragon"" dozens of times. Once this film became available in Blue Ray, I got it. No questions asked. This is the best film about Bruce's life that I've seen, nonetheless.",1427414400,,1293,4.369294605809128

I received the Blu-ray today and I've had time to review the movie.
I wanted to add photos that I've scanned but Amazon is broken and won't allow you to add photos after a review has been posted which includes reediting the post.

Special Features:
All the Special Features are in Standard Definition and not in High Definition.  If you own the DVD version it is the same special features.  Nothing was upgraded to HD in the Special Features and there are NO NEW Special Features nor new commentaries on the Blu-ray version which I was surprised as adding the commentaries from both the actors or the Lee family would had been a nice touch.

DVD to Blu-ray changes I've noticed.
The slip cover that has the passionate french kiss faintly in the background found on the DVD, Laserdisc, and VHS versions of the film has been removed on the Blu-ray version.  Why, I cannot figure the reason as this movie focuses on their love and racism was a huge part of the story he faced throughout his life so I am surprised the slipcover of the Blu-ray version was modified in this manner.

[Audio and video changes from DVD to Blu-ray]
The audio upgrade from Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround to DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was the biggest upgrade aside from 480P SD to 1080P HD picture upgrade.

I'm adding more about my review of this movie.
1-4-2015

[Bruce Lee]
For people who have this idolization of Bruce Lee being invincible, godlike, and untouchable then they would be disappointed in this movie in that regard.

But ultimately the movie was a Hollywoodized form of his actual life that was based on the book ""Bruce Lee, the Man Only I Knew"" written by his then wife Linda Lee Cadwell.

This might be a spoiler alert for those who have not seen the movie yet so discontinue reading past this line.
*****************************************************************

*****************************************************************

[FACT OR HOLLYWOODIZATION?]

An arch nemesis that did not want him teaching martial arts to non Asians was not responsible for Bruce Lee having his back kicked in causing him to be disabled and have back problems the rest of his remaining life. It was a good morning exercise he performed that damaged his back from an improper warmup.

The fight scene on the set of the Big Boss didn't really happen.

The fight scene in the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships did not take place.

The fight scene with the sailors harassing a female dancer doing the Cha-Cha-Cha did not take place.

The fight scene with being chased by chefs with butcher knives did not take place.

The imaginary fight scenes with the demon did not take place.

The only thing that was real in my opinion is the romance that took place between Linda Emery and Bruce Lee.

The movie tries to focus on Bruce Lee, the vulnerable man, not this god like image most people think of him.

I think the scene where he is constantly a perfectionist and editing his films and not being around his family did take his toll on his relationship with Linda and his kids.

Bruce Lee was not a perfect man but strived for perfection in order to create a role model or hero that was unheard of for Chinese and other other Asians which didn't have one at that time.

You can hate the story, the movie, but if you're just looking for the real deal and the epitome of Bruce Lee essence I believe ""Way of the Dragon"" or aka ""Return of the Dragon"" was his best film before his death. There are some cut scenes that showed his comedic side. One scene that was cut was the attractive Italian girl he was flirting with and winking at and ended up going with her to the apartment. She goes into the bathroom to freshen up and when she emerged out of the bathroom naked to Bruce Lee's character Tang Lung's surprise he didn't realize his friendly gestures were interpreted as a sexual invitation. However personally I would have liked to have seen this scene go the other way and not have him run away from her. In the regular theatrical cut he bumps into the coworker asking where he's been all this time and Tang Lung innocently smirks leading the audience to believe something did happen. :)

The reintroduction of the amazing nunchaku and the use of handmake stunning darts.

The gladiator style fight scene to the death with Chuck Norris.

If your family of martial artists want the real deal this is the movie they need to watch if they haven't.

""Game of Death"" in my opinion had one of the best sounding introduction themes of any of his movies. Composed by John Barry Prendergast who also wrote did 11 of the James Bond soundtracks. Had Bruce Lee not died and completed this film this may have surpassed ""Way of the Dragon"" in terms of having his stamp of excellence. The Pagoda scenes might have been legendary and referenced as part of the English lexicon.

[The essence of Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]
What you should take away from this film is first it is an interracial romance love story and second an action film. If you're looking for anything more you're barking up the wrong tree. It is the Hollywoodized version of his life story. Had it been based on actual reality alone it might have made a boring movie seeing Bruce Lee run after a guy and getting winded down a street alley hunched over and then spending minutes trying to take the guy down instead of what we see in this movie with flashy one stroke knock out spectacular fight sequences.

A true fan of Bruce Lee would be one interested in the man's life and learning what shaped him to become the man we now remember today that has become an inspiration for many.

[BLU-RAY]
Despite its inherent flaws and being partially based on Bruce Lee's actual life with Hollywood spicing it up to make it more dramatic and interesting, this is still a must see action and romance movie that for awhile seemed like it would never be released on DVD which is finally coming to Blu-ray.

For audiophiles, aside from Randy Edelman's famous Dragon movie theme song which I've heard reused in other movies and trailers (""The Truman Show""), the end credits also contains a small section with a moment of invigorating brilliance and deserves an uncompressed high fidelity transfer to tame the senses.

After originally seeing this in the movie theater I was energized.  Little kids were doing their own mimicking of Bruce Lee outside after the movie had ended.  This is something I've never experienced before but only heard about in Bruce Lee documentaries concerning first hand accounts of people watching his films.  Not long after I bought an old previously viewed Blockbuster VHS tape of the movie.  I've literally watched this obsessively close to a hundred times at one point.  During a sequence that involved Bruce Lee played by Jason Scott Lee in a shoot of ""The Big Boss"" Johnny Sun's younger taller and more muscularly developed younger brother Luke Sun hops out of a van seeking revenge for Bruce Lee pulverizing his older brother.  During the conclusion of the intense fight sequence Bruce Lee leaps up into the air and lands onto Luke Sun's chest and you hear bones cracking while Bruce Lee has an emotional facial moment that even Joan Rivers would envy before having plastic surgery.  On my VHS tape white distortion lines would show up during this leaping and landing sequence which made it even more intense to watch.  When I first saw the DVD in Virgin Megastore even though it was overly priced around $30 at the time I had to grab it.  Years later I would see these for a bargain price of $8.  Eventually, I was able to get this on Laser Disc with its larger beautiful cover.  It has been years since Blu-ray movies were released and 8.5 years seems like a lifetime that this glorious relic has not yet seen the light of day in HD.

On November the 8th, 2014 I sent a letter to the Bruce Lee Foundation asking why hasn't this movie been released on Blu-ray and it has been 21 years since the movie was released which would have made 2013 the 20th anniversary.  It is true this is not a film starring Bruce Lee but a film about his life which I thought deserved to be seen in HD.  For years I wondered if it was ever going to get released.  Today, November the 17th, 2014 I finally see it available on Amazon for Pre-order.  The perfect price would have been $9.99 but $13.99 is still worth it just to show the studios that this movie is in demand and needs to be released properly so I'm pre-ordering mine now after I finish this review.  I will in the future have the VHS, Laser Disc, DVD, and Blu-ray version finally and will do an update review on the Blu-ray version when I get the chance.

It is still a little more than 2.5 months away and I'm hoping that there's still time to emphasize what I would like done to this Blu-ray release or extend the release date to accommodate these suggestions.

[Blu-ray format suggestions]
7.1 DTS Master Audio track as well as the original audio track.  This would be the best way to honor the film.

If there are any actor auditions, behind the scenes footage, cut deleted or extended scenes that have not been released this would the time to bring them to fruition.

Please retain Subtitles and Closed Captioning options for English at the minimum.  I love reading the lines whenever I can't make out what they are saying in the movie.

If possible include the Bruce Lee documentary ""Curse of the Dragon"" updated to Blu-ray quality.  This was later added to the ""Enter the Dragon"" DVD and in my opinion also had the best sound track theme for a documentary.

Include all original bonus content found on the DVD version and if possible upgrade the footage to Blu-ray quality.

It would be nice to see an updated video introduction or commentary by Linda Lee again and one by Shannon Lee since she was also in the movie as an extra in ""The Mamas & the Papas"" band at Bruce Lee's home where they find out ""The Green Hornet"" TV show has been cancelled.

Include a new director's commentary and video introduction from Rob Cohen as well as video and audio commentary from Jason Scott Lee, Lauren Holly, Ong Soo Han, Johnny Sun, Sven-Ole Thorsen, and any other cast members who wish to participate.

[Rob Cohen's ""The Vanishing Son""]
Another great film and TV series also directed by Rob Cohen which I believe should also be released on Blu-ray if possible was the ""Vanishing Son"", which stemmed from the success of ""Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story"".  There were 4 ""Vanishing Son"" movies and then later 1 Season on TV that comprised of 13 episodes.  It delved on a similar path of what ""Kung Fu"" would have been like had a true Asian been cast in the lead role but this time set in modern times instead of the the Old West.  For those familiar with the movies ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""The Joy Luck Club"" this is where the actor Russell Wong got his big start.  Another TV show he was also in called ""The Black Sash"" got cancelled early on.  Both shows delved on trying to help people although shared a common connection with martial arts.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112210/

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_Son

""Vanishing Son"" movies 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the TV series of 13 episodes should be released on Blu-ray and DVD.

The bad guy Johnny Sun acted by John Cheung who played Bruce Lee's nemesis in ""Dragon : TBLS"" also played a martial arts instructor in the ""Vanishing Son"" 1 movie pilot.

I would be interested in helping edit and transfer the ""Vanishing Son"" footage if that is something no one is willing to do.  If no one does it will never get done and I would hate to see the film stock vanish into obscurity.  This series I believe played an important part in having an Asian lead actor in American television thanks to Rob Cohen.

Thankfully someone at the Bruce Lee foundation has listened and we are finally seeing Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story coming to Blu-ray unless this was just an amazing coincidence I am still grateful it is happening. :)",1416182400,2,12251,4.718177548144669

The movie is obviously about one of the greatest stars of Hollywood but while fairly true did lionize some elements of his life or so I'm told. Jason Scott Lee (no relation to Bruce Lee, sad to say) did a really good job as the titular character and should've gotten a nomination for best actor of every single type of award in my eyes. Lauren Holly was equally good as his wife, Linda and also should've gotten a nomination for best actress in all types of award as far as I'm concerned. The fight scenes were exciting but a little intense for a PG-13 if you ask me. The movie also has a reasonable 2 hour running time length.

Because Dragon tells a story of one man's journey to not only fulfill his dreams in life, but who faces his demons and finds love along the way. The actors deliver fine performances. Jason Scott Lee is terrific (great physical presence), and the rest of the cast is solid. The martial arts sequences are very well done-none that overly fake stuff.

57047,4,0783226985,"Jason Scott Lee did a wonderful job portraying one of the greatest martial artists of all time and probably the best of the 20th century. Anyway everything about this movie I have loved since I was 8 back in 1994. It's a timeless classic. Not the BEST movie ever but I give it 4 solid stars for the intensity of the drama and fight scenes as well as good score and script. It's surely not a boring movie either, it delivers even though it's not a Bruce Lee movie in the sense of HIM actually acting and fighting against crime syndicates/Japanese imperialists. It's someone acting as him portraying his life, which a lot was made up but still good content. It outlined his life pretty accurately of course the details aren't perfect and a lot of people complain about this. Still impressive in all aspects. If you like martial arts movies or Bruce Lee I don't see this being something you'd not like.",1371600000,,899,4.521472392638037

He had his own will and knew what was best - but others did not recognize that, they should go along with his direction.  Now, looking back, they would most likely change their minds.  This film is about the power of love and about his struggles with external outdated views and inner family demons.  He seems to have never rested and I think wanted to go beyond perfection.  In this film - it shows how his wife understood him and how connected they always were.  The music in the film adds alot - it is also very beautiful and dramatic.  After seeing this film,  I feel he is still alive and with us, here in the world.  The leading characters fit there roles very well.

57212,4,0783226985,"My major shortcoming as a devotee of martial arts movies is that I'm not a fan of Bruce Lee's films: classy as they may be, they were made in a time before onscreen kung fu had developed to my preferred standard, and I'm just not a fan of 1970s media in general. With that said, it's impossible not to be fascinated by the man's life and his contributions to the martial arts, and as far as I'm concerned, this 1993 Hollywood movie does a very good job at displaying both - at least a much better one than the few low-budget Hong Kong renderings I've seen. Is the movie flawless? - no. Is it 100% factually accurate? - far from it. But what the film does right is majestically portray the Dragon's life as the nonstop adventure that most of us believe it was while building him up as a truly admirable figure. When it comes to someone like Bruce, I don't think it's improper to flatter him a bit.

The film begins with Bruce Lee beginning his kung fu training in China before jumping ahead to his immigration to America, where he teaches martial arts, finds love, combats the race barrier, and ascends to his film career; and the movie ends with him filming the final shot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/6304981635/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon</a>. Universal Studios' choice to play Bruce was an interesting one: at the time, Hawaiian-Chinese actor Jason Scott Lee was a small-name performer whose most noteworthy credit at the time was a bit part in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-to-the-Future-Part-II/dp/B001LXIDW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back to the Future Part II</a>&nbsp;and who hadn't studied the martial arts before. With a multitude of Bruce Lee-lookalikes still on-hand from the ""Bruceploitation"" period following the original Lee's death, it's weird that the studio would choose someone who only looked partially like him and had never even lived in China. With that said, I ultimately don't think it was a bad choice: Jason has a good deal of Bruce's mannerisms down pat, and he managed to replicate Lee's impressive physique more accurately than anyone else I've seen.

The way Lee has been written in the film is likely a cause for dissent among some viewers, but I have no problem with it. While the real-life Lee - as we see in his films and interviews - always exuded self-assurance that bordered on arrogance (though justifiably so), Lee in the film is much more open to emotion and more than once completely loses his cool; but keep in mind that the film is based off of his wife Linda Lee Caldwell's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/biography/dp/0446787744/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">biography </a>&nbsp;on him, so it's reasonable that Lee is presented in a more personal, vulnerable light here. He's not the impassive man-god that a lot of people seem to regard him as, but in trade-off, he's much more likeable than I perceived him as in archived footage.

The film is written in a way that it presents Lee to the audience from the ground up, detailing most important events in his life - a major improvement over fare like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruce-Lee-The-Man-and-the-Myth/dp/B000ERVK8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruce Lee: The Man and the Myth</a>&nbsp;that hops around his life's timeline, assuming you know what's happened in-between. With that said, some of the changes the filmmakers made to history serve no purpose (e.g. renaming Jesse Glover as Jerome Sprout and replacing Wong Jack Man with a fictional character), so some credit is definitely lost. Also, I'm not pleased with the subplot wherein Bruce regularly is faced with a giant demon that only he can see (played by stuntman Sven Ole-Thorsen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B00003CXE7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>). Obviously this is meant to be symbolic and metaphorical to Lee's struggle with his inner demons - a point touched on frequently in the film - but it feels out of place when the rest of the movie has played things so down-to-earth. It would've been fine if these encounters were brief, like the one following the funeral of Lee's father, but when Lee and the giant actually start fighting, it feels like a bad psychedelic trip.

Speaking of fighting, that's one thing I can't find fault with. ""Dragon"" isn't the first martial arts film I saw, but it is the one that made me realize how cool the martial arts could be in movies. Not all of the seven showdowns are fantastic, but they're all grandly presented and the choreography was really superior for Hollywood at the time. The second-to-last fight, wherein the real-life confrontation on the set of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fists-of-Fury/dp/B00005BCKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fists of Fury</a>&nbsp;is recreated with Malaysian martial artist Hans Ong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport-2/dp/B00005MM61/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport 2</a>), is an absolute showstopper and still constitutes one of my favorite brawls of all time. Jason Scott Lee deserves particular credit: though there's a bit of doubling to be seen throughout the film, his effort and natural athletic talent shows to the point that I wouldn't have been able to guess that the film was his first excursion with martial arts. The style of the choreography is far removed from both that of the real Lee's movies and from what Lee taught his students, but I really don't care - these fights are good, plain and simple.

I can't find anything wrong with the direction of Rob Cohen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/xXx/dp/B00005JL3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">xXx</a>). After proving that he can do a serious but cool piece like this, it's sort of disappointing that he entrenched himself in a world of explosions and computer graphics subsequently, but in retrospect, I'm pleased that a filmmaker who's obviously so in-tune with the Hollywood action scene had the subtlety and perception to pull off a flattering biographical piece like this. Maybe the five-star Bruce Lee biopic is still out there, waiting to be made, but as far as I'm concerned, this one is a fine enough film to wait alongside of.

57262,5,0783226985,"Bruce Lee is known as the Dragon.  But whose Dragon was he?  This film shows that his breakthrough in Hollywood is one of the most important events of the past fifty years there.  His courage in the face of injury, adversity, and racism is the top inspiration to any Asian actor trying to make it there.  Of course, his invention of his teachings, of Jeet Kune Do, marks a milestone in martial arts as well.  This film shows how hard it was to spread his Tao and how wonderful his successes were in his short but intensely full life.  Jason Scott Lee plays him and does it well.  His intire life is portayed faithfully by a cast of lookalikes and people who obviously stick to the true story of his life.  The movie avoids banal music and unnecessary dialogue.  It also really looks like a sixties-to-seventies period piece.  Linda Lee (now Caldwell) is shown as a strong and supportive loving force in his entire adult life. After he leaves Hong Kong to make it in the USA he encounters trouble at the only job he finds, in dishwashing in San Francisco.  His boss gives him the money to go to college and she advises him to cool out and work hard.  He attends Mills College in Oakland where he meets and dates Linda, a cheerleader.  No one seems to approve of him in her life, but she loves him, and enters his world.  He teaches her and everyone else his philosophy and his art.  When nearly disabled in competition, he does not accept it.  Jason Scott Lee shows Bruce's determination to recover.  After that, Hollywood is conquered.  He then shows Hollywood and Hong Kong a thing or two, and there is much success.  The children are born and everything seems fine.  The Dragon is on the move.  But is he?  He dies suddenly in the midst of making a film that is the pinnacle of his career.  Was it murder? A curse? Or just an overdose?  The film ends on this tragic note,as a another Hollywood legend breaks through and crashes too soon.

Lee was already running his own kung-fu school (in Seattle) when he met his wife-to-be; he did not open this school at her suggestion, as the film indicates...Lee did NOT suffer from hallucinations, Lee began training at age 13 not as a child as depicted, Bruce was a successful child star with some 10+ films to his credit before going to America in 1958 not 1961 as stated in the movie...ARRRRGGGHHHHH......just be warned EVERYTHING in this movie has NOTHING to do with Bruce Lee's real life, art and philosophy.

Dragon details all the aspects of Bruce Lee's life. From his triumphs to his failures. It briefly deals with his philosophy and how his own style of fighting(Jeet Kune Do) came to be.

Jason Scott Lee does an excellent job as Bruce Lee and Lauren Holly does perfect as his wife, Angela. The film does the best it can detailing important aspects of Bruce Lee's life and even though I doubt any film can dig deep into the life of Bruce Lee, Dragon did a great job at telling his story with the information that they got. My only gripe is the 6 minute introduction by his wife in the beginning of the movie. I'm not showing disrespect but she kind of told you what to expect from the movie and most people want to find out for themselves what the movie is about.

is,there's no denying it is entertaining.one thing that is probably
depicted fairly accurately is the struggle Lee faced from street punks
to those in the entertainment industry,.but the movie also has it's
lite side.there is some humour to lighten things up.the action
sequences are done pretty well,but maybe a bit over the top. Jason Scoot
Lee handles the role of Lee very well,even though he may not fit Lee
physically.he is much larger than Lee was. Lauren Holley is good as
Lee's love interest Michael Learned is particularly good as the mother
of Linda Emery who does not approve of the union of the two,because of
the differences in culture.no doubt there are things this movie leaves
out,and many things which are changed to make it more appealing to
audiences,if you look at it as entertainment,you shouldn't be

57297,3,0783226985,"Lets do the good things first. If you like martial arts movies you will probably enjoy this. Jason Scott Lee does a good job portraying Bruce Lee, and there are some very good fight sequences in the film. There are also some clever recreations of some of Bruce Lee's most famous moments, such as the classic scene in The Green Hornet, and the mirrors sequence in Enter the Dragon.

However the film is a big let down in many ways. Supposedly its based on the book his wife wrote, but clearly the writers and producers just decided to ignore the book. All the key points in the film revolve around Bruce Lee fights. Some of these may have been for real but I just didn't believe that most the key moments in his life revolved around him beating somebody in a fight. As a previous reviewer has pointed out, his back injury was the result of training not a fight.

The ending of the film was very disappointing. A voice-over that may or may not have been his real wife makes a bland statement about people always talking about the way he died, and not about the way he lived. Thats it - no explanation for his death is given at all. The filmmakers had the opportunity here to portray the likely truth* in the film which would have helped stop further speculation.

*He took painkillers for a headache, and lay down on a bed and never woke up.

So from an entertainment point of view this is worth watching, though its no masterpiece. From a factual point of its of very limited value, and you would be better reading some of the more reputable books on Lee, if you really want to know about his life.",1192579200,5,1597,4.367003367003367

This part of the movie never happened. Bruce Lee never got beat up and he never fought the gung fu San Francisco man's brother. Bruce Lee also never got his back broke in a fight. Bruce suffered a pinched nerve in his back through improper weight training. Any true Bruce Lee fan knows this movie is not accurate. If your going to do a movie about Bruce Lee at least make it accurate. I gave 2 stars instead one out of respect for Bruce.

Dragon is one of those movies. Well acted, solid cast, great script and extremely insightful, Dragon has stood the test of time.

Dragon really is a love story, but also touches on subjects of how the Chinese experienced racial diversity (in the 60's USA) and also deals with Lee's struggle to franchise martial arts (like Mc Donald's).

Only downfall? And this is an important one... IT""S NOT ANAMORPHIC. If you can overlook this tragedy (and heck, it's only priced at $7), this is a crucial addition for anyones dvd collection and a good temporary dvd until they sort out the format issue.

57324,5,0783226985,"I'm not the biggest Bruce Lee fan in the world (heck, I haven't even seen one of his movies) but I thoroughly enjoyed this Dragon movie that follows the important events of his life.

We see him working as a dishwasher in Japan until he's offered a chance to go to college in America.  When he takes advantage of this opportunity, he meets ultra-hot blonde chick Lauren Holly and they shower together and stuff.  After graduation he struggles to open a martial arts school, and has a few bouts with a giant imaginary demon that has followed him from Japan to America.  In addition to that, he has to fight a devestating paralysis while his wife (Lauren Holly) is pregnant with their first child.  Man, talk about an uphill battle.

He is inspired to write a martial arts book during his recovery at the hospital and demonstrates its effectiveness in a martial arts ring, against the very man who paralyzed him in the first place.  Some big shot producers see this and decide to put him in a bunch of action movies.

Too bad the darn imaginary demon just won't go away.  In Bruce Lee's last vision, the demon abducts his firstborn son.  Of course, Bruce flies into a rage and ends up choking the giant monster down with nunchucks.  That's pretty much the end of the movie, and the last thing we see is a shot of Bruce Lee training a whole horde of martial arts students from his many, many opened schools.  Great story, great action, and man, I like Lauren Holly.",1168732800,,1462,4.496212121212121

1.  He didn't broke his back because somebody kicked him from the back, he had it because an overtrain.

2.  This movie portray Bruce as someone easily seduced by women before he was married.. I don't believe such a deep philosopher like that would do something silly such as seduced by the woman in the restaurant the first time he to got to america.

3.  In the match where a combat was offered to decide upon his rights to teach other non-chinese students, according to Bruce Lee's wife LInda Lee.. she watched that match..

I think this movie is just like the case with Jet Li's fearless.  People need to tell accurate stories, because this can be used as guide by youngsters and elders in order to pursue a better life.

57326,5,0783226985,"Okay....It can be said I have been meening to write this review for a LIFETIME.  This is my all time favorite move, so YES it is baised a bit.  BUT there is no doubt this movie deserves 5 stars.

Over the top?  YES!

Fictitious?  YOU BET!

Outrageous at time?  FOR SURE!

Do all these things describe the man and the soul we love as the individual who single handedly brought down the race wall for Asians in this country? Is he and the film not the things that made us take a HARD look at ourselves and suddenly fill bad when it was US who laughed at the ""Asian"" character being poked fun at in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""?

ABSOLUTELY!

That is why this movie IS such a perfect score of the life of Bruce Lee.

It is laced with fact and fiction.  It should come as NO surprise to many in this world of modern media that a man who's life can be traced step by step from personal accounts and those who knew him would still be so much a mystery and become the stuff of legend.

It is in this sense then, that the movie take on a fictional stature in parts.  His life is legend despite being a modern man.

His thoughts were moving and complex.  The scenes depicting these thoughts processes are the same as they should be.  Never has a man thought more on himself and the relationship of himself to the world around him while at the same time giving all he had to be the man he must.

The film does a ABSOLUTELY PERFECT job of portraing Bruce as Bruce the husband and father.  We forget that a man whom was so at one with the world around him would thus know exactly what is means to be a man....Family and the responsibilities that come with it.

Particualr things to note about the film:

Jason Scot Lee....  The ONLY man who COULD have played him.  He was and still is in PERFECT shape.  He looks both physically and with his expressions like Bruce.  The scene where he and Linda get in a fight in there house about him ""changing""....  Look closely at Jason when it shows a close up of him in the shadows.  You would swear it WAS Bruce!  He trained with the instructors for the role in Jet Kune Do and now practices on a regular bases.  If you have seen Jason is Time Cop II then you SWEAR it is a Bruce Lee film.  In a way you fill bad for him, as he to me, and others, is now the man who played Bruce Lee.

Ms. Holly does an good job as Linda.  But it is the chemistry that Jason and she has that makes it really work.  Their believable love for each other gives the viewer a truely inside look into the couple that stands to be recongnized together for greatness.  Behind every good man is a great woman afterall.  This being true, Linda, you have a great soul indeed.

Randy does a PERFECT job on the score for the movie.  Well, he does in EVER movie he scores for though.  The songs are dramatic and beautiful.  The soundtrack is amazing.  If you love the film, buy the soundtrack.  If you love good dramatic music, buy the soundtrack.  It was even reused in the ""Harry Poter"" movies.  That says something about the timelessness and quality of the peices presented.

The fight scenes are epic and are in no short of true display of Jet Kune Do and martail arts excellenece.  One of the scenes was voted as one fot he best fight scenes of all time recently I read.  Bruce himself would have enjoyed the way that they were done.

The scene at Ed Parker's where he beats his opponent in less then 60 seconds is one of the MOST uplifting moments in modern film.  (Right up there with the last second shot in Hoosiers and when Rudy takes the field.)  It makes you wanna do something great in your life....It is truely an inspirational moment.

The other scene that stands out to me is when Bruce protects Brandon from the spirit that has come for Brandon....Very....strange in what the film mirros real life with Brandon.

Again, the film is inspirational, uplifting, passionate, and over the top.  All things Bruce Lee are shown here in other words.  His love for his art, his culture, and his family were unmatched.  This film is a lovely peice of art for that reason of depiction.",1161302400,4,4083,4.273560209424084
57327,4,0783226985,"For a martial arts movie, if you wanna categorize there, the movie is superb.  However, Dragon is more so a drama, yet there is enough action to place it into a martial arts category too.  I have watched this film numerous times, and I am always impressed on what a masterpiece it really is.  There are two things that make this movie so wonderful.  One, Bruce Lee's life really was a story to be told.  Two, the story is told very well in this movie.

Jason Scott Lee plays the Bruce Lee character and does an excellent job.  In my opinion, there just aren't many people out there that can look and act like Bruce Lee, but I feel that Jason pulls both off great.  The actress who plays Lee's wife does an equally fine job too, and combined, the two have a great chemistry in Dragon.  Another character I like in Dragon is Ong Soon Han, who plays Lee's real life nemesis.  Ong Soon Han participates in a fight scene that Ultimate Fights named as one of the best in martial art movies.  The scene is only a few minutes, but it is an intense fight on the set of one of Bruce Lee's movies.

If you like a good drama based on a real life legend, Dragon is just wonderful.  If you wanna see some great action, Dragon has plenty of that too.  As a martial arts categorized film, I would easily give this 5 stars.  But for a drama I will give it 4.",1157932800,3,1341,4.163424124513619

What is described as Cohen's 'artistic license' is in plain English another Hollywood money grubber exploiting Bruce by manufacturing lies to sell a film and line his pockets at the expense of Bruce's life.  Bruce would be outraged at this blatant rip-off! You should be too.

If you want to know about the real Bruce, see the films Enter The Dragon, Return of the Dragon, Fists of Fury and The Chinese Connection.  Also read his books such as the Tao of Jeet Kune Do, the Tao of Gung Fu, and the series entitled Bruce Lee's Fighting Method by Bruce and M. Uyehara.

57351,4,0783226985,"The life of Bruce Lee is fascinating story of one man's triumph over racism, poverty and cultural backlash.  Bruce Lee was not just a martial artist, he was a man who believed in making himself and his art, his life and his soul, better than it was.

Although inaccurate in many parts, Dragon lays down a story that is very close to what Lee had to endure in coming to America and wanting to make a life for himself.  Dating an American girl and starting a martial arts school that taught traditional style had people on both sides persecuting him.  The Chinese elders did not want him teaching Americans their ways, while Americans threw racial slanders at him.  Lee was willing to teach anyone, his did not believe in the cultural boundries and wanted to share what he knew.

Dragon contains six separate fight scenes, all very energetic and very faithful to the moves and skill of Bruce Lee in the Kung Fu style he studied since he was a child.  Jason Scott Lee (no relation) is very athletic and does a spectacular job of imitating the moves of the master.  Closer scrutiny may show that his is just mimicking, Scott Lee is not a strict martial artist and pretty much learned things from the ground up for this film.

He plays the part with even more conviction though.  His character performance is powerful and striking, containing many nuances and mannerisms that Bruce Lee had.  He may not look that much like him, but he makes up for it in sheer character.  Lauren Holly holds her own as Linda, the girl ousted by her parents for being with Bruce because he was Chinese.  She has good strength of character but nothing really stands out about her.

This was director Rob Cohen's first major film and although his track record afterward is non-impressive, this movie probably holds the most substance of any of his work.  Although there is a lot of creative license going on in the movie, it is a touching tale of overcoming adversity and personal fear.  A piece of trivia; Bruce Lee's son Brandon died on the set of `The Crow' the same year this movie was released.  In Dragon, Bruce fights off a menacing creature who is trying to kill his son...the parallels are creepy.",1110412800,7,2181,4.579896907216495

Once you say ""Bruce Lee STORY"", the limits of ""changes for dramatic purposes"" are extremely reduced. And, as a fan of Bruce's movies, I watched it expecting to learn something real about his life, not a movie that has practically the whole script fabricated, almost 100% fake! I could not believe my eyes while I was watching it!

The only people who can give this picture a five star rating are the ones who did not watch Lee's movies or don't care about his real life. That's the only explanation.

It does not even mention, for example, how Bruce was capable of WRITING and DIRECTING (in WAY OF THE DRAGON); it portrays him fighting like an acrobat in real street fighting - he would never done that; it creates a match that never happened in an underground facility, than creates a fight during a karate eexhibition that also never happened, and then the BROTHER of the guy he defeated in this fight appears in the set of THE BIG BOSS, wanting revenge!!!! GOosh!

Key members like greedy Raymond Chow had their names changed, and also the reasons to his death is completely forgotten.

I admit that telling it all would require at least a three and a half-hour movie... But the subject was treated ina wrong manner, intending only to make money..

It follows the life of Bruce Lee from his childhood in Hong Kong to right before his death.  The DVD version is particularly interesting because it comes with a few interviews that really shed light on Bruce Lee the man.  This movie doesn't just focus on his martial arts, but it also shows his life as a family man, and an American.  I found his struggle against racism to be the most moving point in this movie.  Prior to Bruce Lee, the roles of Asians in Hollywood were restricted to laundrymen, villians, and caricatures.  Through his effort and self-confidence, Bruce was able to make Asians into Hollywood heros.  Suddenly Asia was cool.
Jason Scott Lee does a great job of portraying Bruce Lee and it's a shame that we can't see more of him these days.  You can really feel the power of his performance on the screen.

If I wanted to know the real story about Bruce Lee, I would have watched History Channel or something. Ok, so Lee broke his back lifting weights instead of that kick on back in the movie. Big deal. The movie version was helluva lot entertaining. The real one would have been boring. What's important for me was the travails that Lee had to face and overcome, like racism against the Chinese in the 70's America. What's good for me was the touching love affair between Lee and his wife, Linda. What's important to me was that if Lee had in fact been kicked in the back, I am sure he'd have recovered and kicked back the other guy's butt all the way to Hong Kong! That's what the movie showed- his superior strength and self-confidence. What's important to me was that Lee was shown as having weaknesses of his own, like a flaring temper and deep mental troubles.

I read some posts saying how the movie differs from this or that, but regardless, this is a great film. If half the things in this movie were true, then Bruce Lee, the man, not the movie star, was a wonderful human being. The movie goes beyond showing him as a martial artist/movie star...etc. It shows him as a wonderful husband and father. It shows him as a person who was discriminated against, but rose above it. Sometimes, we have to look beyond the candy coating of movie stardom and see what is underneath.
I think Jason Scott Lee put through a terrific performance.
Of course, yes, it's a movie, and I am sure there are many moments in this film that were exaggerated or just plain did not happen. But, for those of you who enjoy action, comedy, and a good story and are looking for insight of this man, definitely watch this movie.

The movie starts with Bruce Lee's father leading us to a young Bruce Lee, which leads us to believe he was an only child which is not true at all.  He had many siblings.  It is also mistaken that his family was poor - also not the case.  When he is shown down in the bowels of a freighter going to ""Land of Opportunity"" that is also fake.  He was on a passenger liner, albeit not first class it was still like a ""cruise ship.""
He also didn't take Wing Chun kung fu to fight his inner demons... it's because he was punk kid who got into alot of trouble and he needed it to defend himself from other punks.
The scene where he is fighting to be able to teach the non-chinese although real was not fought in a secret cave as the filem indicates, he fought it in his own school as a teacher named Wong Jack Man (his name is mentioned in the film) challenges him.  He didn't get his back broken from a kick in the fight.  He had back problems from lifting weights...
This is just to mention the baloney supposed biography in the film. If you're interested in really knowing who Bruce Lee really was you can get a few good documentaries and you can also read the book that inspired it by Linda Lee (Caldwell).",1068163200,12,1429,4.155797101449275

Lee is presented as a man full of insecurities and disappointments. It his heartbreaking to see the main role in ""Kung Fu,"" a series conceptualized by Lee, go to David Carradine because Lee was too ethnic for mainstream American television.

57374,5,0783226985,"The story opens in Hong Kong, as Bruce Lee (Jason Scott Lee) is forced to flee to America to avoid gang violence. He meets his future wife, Linda (Lauren Holly), and their love story is quite touching.  They marry, despite her prejudiced mother (Michael Learned), and have two children.  A near-fatal fight results in paralysis, but Lee bravely recovers.  He becomes a respected martial arts teacher and then starts his acting career on television as Kato in The Green Hornet.  He is soon starring in Chinese action films in Hong Kong.  He makes ""Return of the Dragon,"" an important American movie filmed in Hong Kong.  Tragically, he dies as a result of a mysterious coma, only weeks before the film's premiere, at the age of 32.

Jason Scott Lee is so charismatic and likeable here, that you simply cannot take your eyes off of him.  He is equally adept at action scenes and love scenes, and even if you don't like martial arts films, you will like this movie very much.  Lauren Holly has her best role to date as Linda Lee, strong, supportive, and courageous wife and mother. The script is excellent.

This is a heartwarming film about love and courage; I highly recommend it.",1054944000,8,1179,4.679611650485437
57375,5,0783226985,"There are things here about Bruce's life that are fictional (Bruce's book ""The Tao of Jeet Kune Do"" wasn't published until AFTER his death) and some of the facts the filmmakers did get right were somewhat out of order (Bruce's father died in 1965, not 1970, and Bruce also didn't put his Jeet Kune Do philosophy on paper until 1970), but this movie wasn't hurt on bit by all that. It's an absolute blast to watch Bruce's long, rigorous journey from being just another Chinaman to the legend that he is today. Of the facts of Bruce's life that are true in this movie, my favorite is when he is teaching Martial Arts to non-chinese. This upsets much of the Chinese community, who order Bruce to stop teaching anyone but Chinese. When he refuses, they issue he a challenge to a match, to which, if Bruce is defeated, he must close his school. Bruce accepts, and faces his opponent in one of my favorite fights ever. It's not going to be spoiling anything, because we all know Bruce smacked that guy around like an inflatable doll. All in all, this movie is about 80% faithful to Bruce's life story, and fans of trivia will no doubt know that Bruce's son, Brandon Lee (who himself became a kung fu star)was originally considered for the part of his father. Jason Scott Lee (no relation) is fantastic as both an actor and a Martial Arts master in his own right. It's just a cool movie.

57377,5,0783226985,"I actually reviewed this movie for a junior high school newspaper when it first premiered, and all I could say was ""Wow"".  Prior to seeing the movie, I knew very little about Bruce Lee, and thought of him only as a movie actor.  This film helped educate me to the fact that he was far more than that, even if the film was rarely accurate.  Although it would have been nice if the movie focused more on his teachings of JKD and less on the hokey ""inner demon"" sequences, this film proved that Bruce was easily the martial artist of the century, revolutionizing how we see the fighting arts, their practicality, and the movies that follow.  I heard somewhere that Jason Scott Lee had no prior experience in martial arts and trained for about 6 months in preparation for the movie; I can say that he did a damn good job.  Lauren Holly was excellent in her portrayal as Bruce's wife Linda, and at times (physically) closely resembled her (I know this; I met Linda a couple of years ago at a JKD convention).  The orchestral soundtrack is top-notch and several of the tracks have been used to promote subsequent epic films.
Again, while not entirely following true to the details of his life, this movie will make a Bruce Lee fan out of even the most die-hard critic.  And if you think Jet Li, Jackie Chan or even Donnie Yen are better martial artists, try to find a copy of Bruce's demonstration at Ed Parker's competition in Long Beach :)",1034726400,2,1435,4.475095785440613

Where was the speed and precision?The one-inch punch?.On the plus side the music of Randy Edelman is a classic. It was better than the film. The real fight with Wong Jack Man was not held before a group of Chinese elders and Bruce Lee's back injury was the result of his weight lifting training. No such celebration occured at the""Big Boss""premiere but the scene were the audience sat stunned after the film was real. The movie didn't show his filming of""Fist of Fury""and""Return of the Dragon"".What the heck was""PEARL OF THE ORIENT""studio?.Didn't the filmakers were granted permission to use""GOLDEN HARVEST""and Raymond Chow instead of""Philip Tan""?.They could've searched for a better Brandon Lee look alike thou I have to admit that the film may be Lauren Holly's finest acting job. It's too bad that the actress wasn't given more meatier roles. I find the battle with the demon fascinating and the touches with Bruce Lee's grave(with the actual writings)were,for me;the highlight of the film.

Jason Scott Lee does a great job imitating Bruce's style and mannerisms.  It also accurately showed us the racism involved at the time directed at the Chinese.  Although Bruce Lee was a great man with great ambitions and accomplishments, he wasn't as friendly as the film depicts him to be.  At times Bruce Lee was a bit arrogant and very strong minded and the movie fails to show us that, except when he seemingly temporarily loses his mind argueing with Linda Lee played by Lauren Holly.  Anyway, I love this movie and I love the legend of Bruce Lee, so I reccommend this to any one interested in action movies, Bruce Lee, and inspirational movies.  If you love this film I  also recommend movies like ""Fist of Fury"", ""The Chinese Connection"", ""Return of The Dragon"", ""Enter The Dragon"", and ""Rapid Fire"".

The important thing, of course, is to bring  out the overall ""theme"" of his life, so that valuable lessons and  ""points to ponder"" would be brought out.  For a number of us  Asians, Lee stood for everything a lot of Easterners in his time aspired to  be: someone who can go head-to-head and eye-to-eye with the best the West  can offer, on equal terms, and emerge triumphant.  Cliched and corny it may  be, it is unquestionable that Lee was eventually immortalized in essence  because of this.  And this distinctive ""power"" obviously emanated  from him and him alone (if it hadn't then we would have had a surge of Jeet  Kune Do practicing box-office superstars, which we of course don't!).

57432,2,0783226985,"DRAGON was a 1993 film about the life of legendary Bruce Lee. The movie was fun to watch, but had far too many low points.
First of all, it was quite entertaining. Hoky at times, but fun to watch. The location filming  is good, and the movie is worth owning if, like me, you are an avid Bruce  Lee fan.
The biggest problem with this film is that, dispite it's  entertainment value, it was not true to life. It mixes up the events of his  life, makes things up, and over-dramatizes pointless parts. It also often  makes Lee look much weaker than he really was. Lee could finish off  opponents in a short amount of time if he wanted to, but in DRAGON, he  often takes much longer to do so (in fights that didn't even happen). He  even comes close to losing in a lot of the fights!
Despite all the lows,  the main back-story is correct, and the movie is great to watch. Seriously  though, the best Bruce Lee biography you will find is the one that airs on  TLC (a Canadian channel I believe). Unfortunately, I don't know it's title,  but it was an excellent, touching biography.",953424000,6,1075,4.32
57433,5,0783226985,"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story takes liberties with the bio-film setup and succeeds in spades, resulting in something much more interesting and challenging than straight adaptations of a life.
Director Rob Cohen's sure hand with actors gives him an edge, surely, and his cast is wonderful -- Lauren Holly was in her late 20s at filming but plays her character as a teen deftly. Jason Scott Lee may not look much like Bruce Lee, but unless Brandon Lee were cast, that's an insurmountable limitation. What Jason Scott Lee creates is a Bruce Lee that's much more likeable, more of a boy next door, than the real Bruce Lee, and considering the romantic, mythical tone of the film in general, it was an apt choice. His athleticism and dedication make him come alive onscreen, and the moment when he explodes at Holly shows him as nuts as Bruce Lee was.
The most brilliant touch of this movie was in its appropriation of certain Bruce Lee film idioms. The single most true-to-fact sequence in Dragon, in fact, is the back-alley fight with the cooks. The music, staging, editing and character behaviour here are so much like Lee's films (with the exception of The Chinese Connection) that they emblematize Lee in a way that's purely cinematic. Randy Edelman's score for the whole film was excellent ; this is one reason why you'll very often hear the ""Dragon"" theme used in film trailers -- it is perhaps the most widely used trailer score throughout the '90s.  But his work was especially fit in this sequence.
And the DVD edition? Consider this: Three pages worth of just selection screens for bonus materials; interviews with Linda Lee Cadwell, Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly (I wish there could've been more, though); Jason Scott Lee's screen test -- and not just standing there doing a monologue, but a fantastically staged and filmed fight sequence that could easily have been in a feature; outtakes of the Ed Parker fight sequence; storyboards; a Bruce Lee on-camera interview, photographs from Bruce Lee's life...the only misstep here was Linda Lee Cadwell's verbal commentary to lead off the film. Though quite charming on camera and approachable, she's unbelievably stiff when delivering a written speech, and I wish she had just improvised and *talked* instead of *presented* her thoughts on her husband's life.
Dragon is not true to life. The real-life Bruce Lee, though vivacious and ambitious, is not as likeable as the persona presented here. As the interview footage shows, Bruce Lee was an arrogant man, a man not afraid to proclaim his own greatness, with very little sense of gaucherie. And Dragon's ambiguous ending (""Bruce fell into a mysterious coma..."") is probably because some reports placed Lee at a mistress' house at the time of his death, while others pointed to drug use and/or triad affiliations. But Cohen has made a conscious choice to make Dragon part of the myth, not the ""truth"", and his sensibility remains consistent and effective throughout the film.
Don't watch Dragon to get a real sense of Lee's real-life character. Instead. sit back and watch an earnest celebration, a film interested in proponing the Bruce Lee myth, and simply a good story about an interracial romance made more dynamic by means of action-film conventions.",950400000,42,3261,4.950729927007299

(USA - 1993)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Rob Cohen's martial arts biopic is the best film that Bruce Lee never made. Though Cohen recounts the man's life in some kind of chronological order, he doesn't simply ""tell it like it was"",  preferring instead to visualise Lee's major achievements in terms of his philosophy and beliefs. Therefore, alongside the development of Lee's martial arts techniques (demonstrated in a series of increasingly fluid fight sequences) and his relationship with his wife and children, Lee's inner demons are personified by way of a spectral Ming warrior who seems to intrude on his everyday reality, prior to claiming him forever in 1973 at the age of 32.

Perhaps the film's major triumph is the fortuitous casting of Jason Scott Lee in the title role, giving the performance of a lifetime  under what must have been hugely difficult circumstances, and he dominates a fine cast of supporting players, including newcomers Lauren Holly and Sterling Macer, and veterans Robert Wagner, Michael Learned and Nancy Kwan.",948499200,5,1117,5.247191011235955

7790400,2,0783226985,"I really did not like this film... in fact, I thought it was terrible. Filled with gross inaccuracies and huge distortions of the truth, I can't even believe Lee's widow approved of it to be honest. It does not make Bruce look good at all.

Here's what I mean: instead of telling the story of Bruce Lee and how he became, or led up to becoming a phenomenon worldwide, the movie goes out of its way depicting how America, dominated by evil whites, was so rough on Bruce because of the fact he was Chinese. In fact you are constantly reminded of this throughout the film. While there is no denying that he may have encountered some adversity because of this, i don't believe for a second that it made his life a miserable hell to the point where he threw temper tantrums, complaining constantly of White racism. Yes, the film shows us this in great detail... which is disgraceful. To believe that Bruce Lee was such a whining crybaby about his circumstances in America is such an anathema to the essence and character of Bruce Lee as a man, and as one of the 20th century's most influential figures. You would think if he had such hatred for American society and whites in general, he would never have taught Caucasians kung fu and go so far as to fight for the right to do so in the first place, which he did when Wong Jack Man challenged him (which the film also lied unscrupulously about) . But that's exactly what he did.

If you know anything about Bruce Lee, you would know that he understood why America's attitude toward Chinese was such the way that it was. And when i say attitude, I don't mean persecution. In an interview he did a couple of years before his death, he stated how he understood where American filmmakers were coming from, by saying in effect that if a White would go to Hong Kong, that even that society would have reservations about placing someone like that in their films, let alone having leading roles in movies. And besides film making, it's safe to say that any person who is a foreigner in a different country will occasionally encounter some prejudice. Wouldn't you think that the kind of man Bruce Lee was, that he would brush that aside and not let it get to him to the point where he is blaming everything on Whites? I think so. The film also does not let you know that Bruce Lee's grandfather was German, making him 1/4 White himself, which was something Bruce was always aware of, but yet this film (pretending to be a biopic) carefully omits this fact. Shameful!

The movie lies to you about his fight with Wong Jack Man, by showing him delivering a cheap shot to Lee after the fight was over, which caused his major back injury. This never happened! In actuality, Bruce injured his back when he improperly lifted weights one afternoon. Just think, if they lie to you about this, what else is the film lying to you about? Leave it to Hollywood to diminish a true legend. Don't Watch this!",1524700800,,2928,4.469158878504673

7790403,5,0783226985,"RELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Rob Cohen, "" Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" stars Jason Scott Lee as the martial arts superstar, tracing his early life in Hong Kong to his fresh start in the San Francisco area where he starts a martial arts school, meets his babe (Lauren Holly) and moves on to TV and Film. He must boldly face many enemies along the way, including his childhood demon.

This is basically a rags-to-riches flick and ranks with my favorite films due to its excellent meshing of dynamism, fun and potent drama. I haven't seen too many martial arts flicks, but Dragon is easily the all-around best of those Ive seen. It mixes real-life with Hollywood mythmaking, which is what many cinematic biographies do, e.g. ""Buffalo Bill"" (1944) and ""Braveheart"" (1995). In these types of movies the gist of the story is true, but it's mixed with numerous fictional or even fantastical elements to make the protagonist a larger-than-life hero, but also to entertain the audience because real-life is always more mundane and therefore dull. And movies are made primarily to make money through entertaining, not to relay the truth in exact detail.

Right from the get-go the film telegraphs that it's a mythmaking account when Bruce takes on the arrogant British sailors at a dance. He throws one of them and the sailor topples 3-4 other men accompanied by the sound of a bowling ball striking pins (lol). While this particular episode never happened, occasions LIKE IT did, even if it was to someone other than Bruce. The same is true with other sequences, like the fight in the gym, which never happened. But, again, events LIKE IT have.

The movie is really meant as a celebration of Bruce Lee, his phenomenal expertise in martial arts and the genre he made popular. If you're looking for an actual biography of his life check out the two biographies listed below (under WRITERS).

Speaking of which, Dragon was partially based on the autobiography of Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruces wife). Someone offered that she couldn't possibly have been happy with the film since so much of it is fiction (for instance, Bruce didn't injure his back as depicted, but via lifting weights). Actually, she was happy with the final picture. But why did she allow so many things to be embellished? Simple: Because the embellishing fed into the Bruce Lee legend from which she benefits.

In any case, there are a lot of martial arts thrills mixed with the drama with an exciting action scene occurring roughly every ten minutes. The film gives the protagonist & a few others power over time and space. Of course, one cannot do in real life many of the things these characters perform due to the restrictions imposed by Newton's Laws but, hey, its entertaining. This factor explains why Dragon has been criticized for springing from one thing to the next too quickly, never pausing long enough for any strong emotion to resonate or for us to feel we really know the man beyond his proverbs. I disagree; I sensed strong emotion on several occasions, like when Bruce exclaims to Linda: You make be believe I can do anything or when he wildly screams at her to leave his hospital room, not to mention his outstanding meltdown later in Hong Kong (Ive had a few of those in my life, so I know).

Speaking of Linda, Lauren Holly is just mind-blowing in her physical prime.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours and was shot in California (San Francisco, Los Angeles & Valencia), China (Macau) and Hong Kong. WRITERS: Three screenwriters wrote the script based on the biographies by Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew) and Robert Clouse (Bruce Lee: The Biography).
