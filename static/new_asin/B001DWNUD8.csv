3540717,4,B001DWNUD8,"Werner Herzog wrote, directed, and narrated this latest installment of his cinematic career that has had as its focus the exploration of extreme geographic places and the people who inhabit them. Nature is his stage, but human nature is his plot. When the National Science Foundation invited him to the South Pole, you knew he would not disappoint with another film about cute penguins. The trip begins with a 2,000-mile flight from New Zealand to McMurdo Station, where 1,000 people endure harsh weather, ice 9,000 feet thick, and five months of summer when there is no night. The scientific station looks and feels like a run down mining town. After emergency preparedness training, Herzog is off and running. We meet a banker turned bus driver, a forklift driver who was a philosopher, a glaciologist, biologists, and volcanologists atop 12,000-foot Mt. Arabis. They are all ""professional dreamers"" of one sort or another who live, literally and metaphorically, ""off the margin of the map."" As in many of his films, the collision between technological society, the natural environment, and the survivability of humanity looms large for Herzog.",1231372800,,1146,5.2
3540718,5,B001DWNUD8,"Werner Herzog is one of those unique directors that never give you quite what you expect, but always satisfy.  This film, in amazingly clear and crisp ""blu-ray"" makes you feel as if you are on Antarctica and underwater.  In fact, you feel every scene as Hertoz has a talent of pulling you into the picture.  There is no dispute that a blu-ray player and a good flat screen television is just about as great an experience that you can achieve nowadays and Herzog takes it to task.

The scenes are massive in scale and include glaciers, mountains, underwater breathtaking scenes, human interaction and a thorough dissection of the land and the people that occupy this one outpost.  Hertoz narrates the film with not just his comments on the amazing scenery, but his personal interactions with the people living there to study.  There is plenty of heartbreaking and amazing history throughout the film (i.e., Shackleton's journey).  The characters are both normal and odd.  Traveling to this location in a huge specialized plane shows the crew in each of their unique positions; sleeping in bags on the floor, strapped into less than comfortable looking chairs, tents set up inside the aircraft, conversations both normal and strange.  At times explaining their interest in the areas conditions and their own methods of survival - some of which are quite funny, if the consequences of dying were not so real.

The cinematography is the real star here and with copious amounts of blue and white surrounding you, the feeling is surreal.  There are no cute penguins or whales, just great shots of bizarre looking starfish that move and clams that snap open and shut as they travel through the water.  The underwater visibility is impeccably clear.  The ice cutting, severe wind and blizzards make the experience real.  This is another place with unique individuals all filmed in magically and frightening real circumstances.",1230508800,3,1918,5.009463722397476
3540719,5,B001DWNUD8,"Werner Herzog turns his unique and cosmic gaze on Antarctica and the scientists who work there, and gives us a fascinating and totally unexpected glimpse into this strangest of earthly habitats.  Herzog's mind is so interesting that I would imagine even his reflections on the municipal phone book would be of interest, but when he gets to Antarctica and begins to explore the eccentric personalities, exotic wildlife, and extreme geological phenomena, you're in for an extraordinary film experience.  I enjoyed it as much as ""Burden of Dreams,"" which is brilliant.",1227657600,2,565,5.266666666666667

3540721,4,B001DWNUD8,"I am a big fan of Herr Zog. But while ""Encounters"" provided me with an overall positive experience, it is a flawed film. First, the good news. Hearing the inorganically musical underwater vocalizations of Weddell seals through the theater's multichannel speaker system was alone worth the price of admission. One of the scientists studying the pinnipeds aptly describes their varied and otherworldly sounds as Pink Floydian. I am also pleased to have beheld extended footage of the magnificent world beneath the sea ice. It is a teeming environment whose surface we are only beginning to scratch, and I cannot blame Herzog for choosing choral background music that perhaps screams ""awe"" a bit too loudly; there is no danger of it cheapening the majesty of the frozen stalactites or the splendor of the sunlight dispersing through the ice-ceiling. Lastly, I'll note the humor, usually intentional, that Herzog uncharacteristically displays. His Teutonic deadpan is not his only comedic asset; he has a keen sense of the ridiculous, and ample targets among the many dubious denizens of the Antarctic.

My complaints are essentially twofold. First, the movie is disjointed. It is a hodgepodge of Herzog's encounters with various Antarctic researchers and residents; there is no apparent order or theme. This is a minor criticism, as most of the segments make for fine viewing on their own, but it would have been more satisfying if Herzog had presented a unifying thesis or two about the Light Continent (aside from the oft-repeated observation that it is populated by a fair number of ""professional dreamers""). He should have at least arranged the segments in a clearly meaningful sequence. At its best, the film made no more of an impression on me than ""that was beautiful,"" ""that was cool,"" or ""I didn't know that."" Second, and more significantly, Herzog's narration is at times irritating. As someone who has studied climate change, I share his frustration and pessimism. But there is no call for saddling the film's final moments with apocalyptic platitudes (e.g., ""the end of human life is assured"") and a cursory reference to global warming. These sentiments are incongruous with the rest of the film, which does not substantially address environmentalism and whose most haunting scene is of a mad penguin that abandons its flock and runs inland towards distant mountains, to certain death, with a singular determination. Herzog's doomsayings, in any event, are better communicated by the satellite images of rapidly melting polar ice that we observe on a climatologist's computer screen. I know that Herzog is capable of more thoughtful reflections on the impersonal and uncontrollable power of nature; for example, from ""Grizzly Man"": ""what haunts me is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature. To me, there is no such thing as a secret world of the bears. And this blank stare speaks only of a half-bored interest in food. But for Timothy Treadwell, this bear was a friend, a savior."" In ""Encounters,"" Herzog superficially and self-indulgently overstates his case. I'm looking forward to his next film.",1223683200,29,3238,5.155893536121673

3540726,1,B001DWNUD8,"Awful. Purely awful.

Completely lacks direction. Starts off with an overly long introduction to orchestral music, so you feel like you're getting set up for a Planet Earth type viewing. Then he begins his awkward narration, followed by an often offensive or ignorant line of questioning for interviewees.

There were some impressive landscape and natural shots, but supplemented with vintage film and smattered with mundane and pointless interviews.

This paints the scientists/workers out as simpleminded fools. Would have been nice if he didn't narrate with his snarky comments and just let the scientists do the educating.

What a waste of my time",1460246400,2,651,5.352941176470588
3540727,2,B001DWNUD8,"A fascinating film, but if you don't go into it with a very loose, artistic mindset you will probably be frustrated by the almost complete lack of direction. The film is a collection of  little scenes that, on their own, have value, but all together come to a hodgepodge with no point. In an attempt to find a point, I found myself paying more attention to Herzog's narration than I did to what he was filming, which ended up being a very bad idea because his narration at times seems just as meandering and self contradicting. In one scene he bemoans the ""sick"" human obsession with placing animals above humans in importance (""tree huggers and whale huggers, but no one cares about an entire language dying out."") This gives one the impression of a humanist, of someone going against the modern anti-human grain, and yet the rest of the film is the usual environmentalist whining about the human ""stain"" on the landscape (as if every a human settlement has to be aesthetically ""pretty"" or built into the natural surroundings in a manner that, at the end, is entirely unnatural).

At one point, he refers to the existence of a bowling alley and yoga classes at the settlement as an ""abomination"" that he ""wanted to get away from."" Why? Are humans at the bottom of the world expected to stop being human? Isn't he there for the expressed purpose of recording HUMANS in Antarctica? As I said, meandering and contradicting. The sequences near the end about climate change and a possible future in which ""alien archaeologist"" study the last desperate remnants of a dead species are so over-emotive and irrational they sound like readings of Revelations in an evangelical church; fire and brimstone, pain and misery, sin and punishment.

In spite of all this, the film is worth seeing if only to see how real the humanity is in such places. We, the layman public, are often fed a very clean-cut NASAesque image of what life is like for researchers (and workers, yes!) in these far flung places.",1460160000,2,1990,4.729106628242075

Without spoiling it, I'll just say that under a thin veil of playfulness with the inhabitants of the 'End of the World,' Herzog offers plenty of deeper things to dwell on here.

I was at McMurdo when Herzog filmed/recorded this movie. While I am not featured I do know most of the those featured to some extent or more. I found his treatment honest.

3540751,5,B001DWNUD8,"Werner Herzog has a fascinating way of pulling beauty out of what seems to be the end of the world. The End of the World that he presents not only describes the bizarre place on the bottom of the globe, but also the end of humanity as we know it. Needless to say, Encounters at the End of the World is not your typical documentary. Herzog journeys to the South Pole in what he assures is not another film in search of fluffy penguins, but is a dream-like illustration of the strange lives of the humans and creatures that inhabit and dwell in such a harsh and remote environment as Antarctica.
 Herzog has come to McMurdo Station, which is the largest habitation in Antarctica, for a summer of eternal light. He arrived here after being drawn in by astounding underwater images captured by his friend Henry Kaiser, who happens to be an expert diver. He sets out to discover who the people are that live in such a place, and what it is that brought them. He encounters a slew of odd individuals in this small population. Upon arrival he meets a banker from Colorado who has left his life behind in search for more meaning beyond monetary value and a philosopher who has an utter fascination with the world and has had a desire for adventure since he was a child. He goes on to meet scientists of various disciplines from a cell biologist who views the microscopic world under the ice as being over-run by horrific sci-fi creatures, to nutritional ecologists and physiologists who spend their days on the open ice studying seals while listening to their electronic-like calls passing underneath them; what one scientist compares to Pink Floyd. Herzog encounters a woman who has traveled through South America in a sewer pipe, who now performs odd stunts at one of the bars in the town. All the while there is vivid and strong imagery that you are surely not to forget. From the eerie spider-like sea creatures that creep and scurry along the ocean floor under shelves of ice, to the center of a volcano where we learn the etiquette of dealing with the blasts, to footage taken underneath the eternal ice and exact South Pole where shrines are left for travelers in the future to come across and ponder about once the rest of humanity is lost.
 From the very beginning of the film it is easy to tell that this is very much Herzogs story of Antarctica and the people within it. If it were any other documentary about Antarctica it would be overwhelmed with the threat of global warming and what consequences it holds for humanity, or overwhelmed with an abundance of footage of penguins and polar bears. However, there are penguins in some footage, but shown in a much different way than ordinary. Herzog converses with an isolated and timid penguin researcher, who much prefers being around penguins than conversing with humans, and he persists on asking if insanity and homosexuality exist amongst the penguins. I doubt that anyone else would think of doing that. He narrates his thoughts and feelings throughout and remains strangely honest and true to himself.
Herzog has a peculiar way of interacting with the people that he interviews, as well as a unique way of displaying them. He shows tid-bits of their separate lives and characteristics and converses informally, just as if he were on a vacation with them. Herzog shows the great lengths that they all have gone to escape the dull and ordinary. He shows these strange people in a light that emphasizes their unique individual characteristics that prove to be very memorable to the audience; no character is like the other.  Even though the film has a sort of gloomy feeling that is often expressed through the characters that he interviews, he seems to make a point that they all have found some form of peace at the end of the world. In one scene a philosopher points out that all of the inhabitants are full time travelers, part time workers, and professional dreamers. The philosopher then goes on to explain that Antarctica works as a form of natural selection for the people that have the intention to jump of the map, and they all meet where the lines intersect at the end of the world. Herzog also suggests that they all agree that the end of human life is assured.
 Herzog allows us to journey through time and space, and shows us what we may end up leaving behind. We experience the microscopic findings of what very well could have be the origins of life and what drove us to evolve, to neutrinos that hold together the universe. There is an otherworldly feel that remains consistent. The film nudges at the idea of the end of humanity but does so in way that leaves you at ease with it. This is partially due to the outstanding cinematography and strong music that effectively pull together all of the emotions throughout the film. There are many scenes where the images and sounds do all of the work and emphasize the oddness and beauty of this strange world.
 This documentary is very much a work of art. If you are looking for something informational that tells you how to think, I suggest you look elsewhere. This film successfully stretches the mind out of the ordinary and leaves you to your own thoughts and wonders about life and death and the continued universe in between. Herzog has an extremely artistic eye that shows forms of beauty in a very different light, that most would not observe and leave you feeling as if you are part of a much larger picture.",1401926400,2,5436,4.646569646569646
3540762,4,B001DWNUD8,I enjoyed this movie very much and thought it was well done.  It was interesting to see the types of research that are conducted in the Antarctic.,1399593600,,146,4.407407407407407
3540763,5,B001DWNUD8,"I was already a Herzog fan after having seen ""Grizzly Man"" and ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"", so I eagerly heeded a friend's recommendation to watch ""Encounters"".  Although I found that Encounters was, in a sense, different from the other two Herzog films I'd seen previously, it nonetheless proved to be an experience that had me singularly focused upon the screen for the entire duration of the movie.

I want to be clear that this is a film which pulls together something of a mish-mash of Herzog's experiences and thoughts about the South Pole: stories of people, excursions into scientific research and intriguing philosophical insights.  Some of those who disliked the film complained that it ""lacked a unified theme"", but I think they've missed the point.  ""Encounters"", by design, is an odyssey without a destination. It paints a riveting and diverse picture of the South Pole as an otherworldly place of disjointed oddities... truly a collection vignettes which are unified only by the fact that they grow out of this desolate and beautiful continent.

Another complaint I've seen is that the film fails to serve as a call to action for tackling the issue of global warming.  In an era when polar ice is melting faster than at any other time in human history, I suppose that I can understand why some folks might be disappointed that Herzog didn't leverage his fame and skill to make a film which would highlight and condemn global warming.  As someone who is deeply concerned about the condition of our environment, I am sympathetic to their opinion.  Still though, I feel like they're overlooking the simple fact that Herzog's brand of art is simply not preoccupied with environmentalism.  Herzog's ""Encounters"" is not a plea to save the future... in fact, it's the exact opposite in a certain sense.  Like many researchers in the film, Herzog is resigned to the notion that humanity is ultimately doomed in one way or another, so this film precludes the idea of saving anything or reversing global warming.  Instead, Herzog explores a more immediate and momentary ""world of now"".  In a sense, he asks us,"" What if we knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that humanity was doomed?  How and where would we find beauty in the face of such destruction?  Where would we find the profound?  What is the meaning, if any, in a world that will surely end?""  That makes for a sublime exploration of this unusual part of the world, even if it means that he mostly ignores the issue of whether or not it matters that we save the ice caps.

This film is a documentary, but not a documentary in the sense that you come away having learned something scholarly.  It is an artistic exploration of the South Pole... one that seeks out more than just banal facts. Herzog decided not to make a piece that centered upon environmental activism, and I think he did so with insight and mastery.  For sure, his unique brand of stoicism and pessimism paints a picture of the South Pole that is bleak.  But in doing so, he skillfully invites you to find beauty in spite of ugliness... hope in spite of hopelessness... and some hazy, yet profound, truth about humanity in one of the most desolate places on earth.",1391731200,3,3189,4.742753623188406

Some are remarkable scientists, but even the plumbers and cooks display courage and resourcefulness, and have something to say worth your time .

3540766,5,B001DWNUD8,"Everybody has their favorite existential, nihilistic German film director. Mine happens to be Werner Herzog. His documentary Grizzly Man is my favorite film from his oeuvre, It tells the story of Timothy Treadwell, an eccentric who lived with Alaskas wild bears  until he was eaten by them.

But this post isn't about Grizzly Man. Rather, it is about my second favorite Herzog film. In Encounters at the End of the World Herzog takes on another fascinating topic. This film documents his visit to the McMurdo Station in Antarctica, a tiny dot of human civilization which is set in the midst of a vast brutally cold and unremittingly hostile landscape. The setting is significant. Herzog is an atheist who speaks often of his convictions in his films. And it seems that in this case McMurdo serves to symbolize the human condition: civilization hanging on by a thread, hoping that an army of Honda generators can withstand the howling winds and bone-chilling cold of the Antarctic night. And all the while utter annihilation is always but one massive power failure away.

The film largely consists of Herzogs interviews with many of the people who find their way down to McMurdo (2000 in the summer, a skeleton crew of 200 attempting to hold cabin fever at bay in the winter). The interviews are fascinating and provide a cross-section of an ecclectic humanity. Time and again it is intriguing to learn what draws people to the very bottom of the earth.

While there are many great moments in the film, perhaps the most memorable of all is captured in this clip where we consider the plight of penguins gone astray. Early in the scene we see one penguin set off on a strange course. As Herzog narrates, He would neither go toward the feeding grounds at the edge of the ice or return to the coloney. Shortly afterwards we saw him heading straight toward the mountains some seventy kilometers away. It makes no sense. Herzog explains that even if the penguin was caught and brought back to the feeding grounds, it would immediatley turn around and head back to the mountains. Herzog  cannot help but ask: But why?

Occasionally other penguins inexplicably set off on a similar course. Herzog shows footage of another penguin shuffling past researchers staying at a camp. At this point that penguin was already eighty kilometers away from where it should be. As it continues on over the rock and snow Herzog observes,  here hes heading off into the interior of the vast continent. With five thousand kilometers ahead of him hes heading towards certain death.

Herzog asks the question: do penguins go crazy? Do they just become tired of life? Are some of them deranged? What drives a penguin to acts that will culminate in its own destruction? What is a life well lived for a penguin? What does any of this matter? We must ask those questions while knowing that Antarctica, like the entire grand universe, neither knows nor cares about the wayward path of penguins  or people.

3540769,4,B001DWNUD8,"In Encounters at the End of the World, director Werner Herzog and crew travel to Antarctica to meet the people who live and work at a research station there. These men and women can be divided into two basic types: There are the disgruntled scientists doing fascinating research in varied fields of biology, earth sciences, and even physics. And then there are the members of the support staff, who perform such tasks as maintenance work, heavy machinery operation, and driving the bus from the airfield. The stories and personalities of this group of oddball dreamers contrasts with the tedious work they perform, and the muddy research station they reside and work in differs sharply from the beautiful, frozen wilderness surrounding them.

Herzog had no trouble holding my attention through interviews with these quirky people, the work they do, and the charmed (but in some ways unglamorous) lives they live ""at the end of the world."" I also found the research being performed near the South Pole to be fascinating, and enjoyed getting to look down a volcano with vulcanologists and through a microscope with cell biologists. But what captivated me the most by far were the scenes of the ""cathedral"" under the ice. The ecosystem there is like something one might imagine of an alien world. There are also some interesting interviews with ecologists discussing their studies of local wildlife, though the cute, fluffy animals typical of Antarctic nature documentaries certainly aren't the focus of the film.

In fact, it doesn't have much focus at all, which is one of my two major criticisms of the film. There seems to be no unifying thesis. There are the interviews with the quirky people, glimpses at scientific research, and more than enough footage of natural beauty--but nothing to tie it all together. The closest the film comes to a theme concerns the environment and the sustainability (or unsustainability) of our species, which is symbolized with footage of a penguin stubbornly running miles inland, condemning itself to die for no apparent reason. Rather than giving any constructive criticism of civilization's current trajectory, Herzog simply grinds this wearisome and somewhat misanthropic ""doom and gloom"" axe.

My other major criticism is of Herzog's voice-overs, which can be obnoxious. He has clearly asked his interviewees to tell their stories, but when they do he sometimes rudely interrupts them by drowning them out with his voice-overs. ""Her story goes on forever"" he says of one person. ""To make a complicated story short,"" he cuts off another. Herzog criticizes a former graduate student for abandoning his linguistics research, and laments that few care about the passing of a language, while "" tree huggers and whale huggers in their weirdness are acceptable."" So much for the environmental message; environmentalists are ""tree huggers"" and ""whale huggers"" and are ""weird!""

This soundtrack includes some great playing by Kaiser and Lindley (both electric and acoustic) as well as contributions from the local Weddell seals (who communicate in an other-worldly, analogue synthesizer sounding way), and various musicians (similar sounding to the Herzog soundtrack&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Requiem-for-a-Dying-Planet/dp/B000GB7DTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Requiem for a Dying Planet</a>) with what sounds like Norwegian Hardanger fiddle, Malagasy guitar, cello, Bulgarian Throat Singers, Russian Basso Profondo, and other choral arrangements.

I found that the music was annoying and over-dramatic to the point where the soundtrack drowned out what was going on film.  It felt a lot like he picked random, ethereal music to play during some scenes.  He cut off interviewees so that he could paraphrase what they were saying.  Often, the camera would awkwardly linger on an interviewee for so long, that they would make a random noise or action just to fill the gap.  And, to be quite honest, I don't appreciate his sardonic narration.  The bit about the Guinness world book of records was out of place, and his statement about how modern polar exploration is somehow seemingly 'fake' compared to the old-time polar explorers is completely false.  He's obviously never picked up a history book.  It's fun to glorify people in history... but humanity (and their motivations) really haven't changed that much over the years.

That said, without his annoying narration and little 'philosophical moments' (gay penguins, why cowboys wear masks, and why chimpanzees don't ride antelopes) there are some really cool moments.  The scenes following the scientists are quite fascinating to watch, and for someone who's not familiar with McMurdo, I think seeing what the base looks like would be a real treat.

The film had no focus, and to put it bluntly, had amateurish editing.",1356825600,5,1384,4.922413793103448
3540807,4,B001DWNUD8,"On the heels of the excellent 2005 documentary ""Grizzly Man"", Herzog comes back with another great feature, this time visiting Antartica, upon invitation by the National Science Foundation. Herzog observes dryly (as only he can) in the opening scenes, ""I told them my film wouldn't be one about cute marching penguins"", ha!

""Encounters at the End of the World) (2007 release; 100 min.) finds Herzog and his cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger visiting Antartica. Upon landing at McMurdo Station, Herzog cannot hide his disdain for that place, observing that ""this is what a station on the moon would look like"". But he gets in better spirits fast, upon meeting several interesting characters who live at McMurdo (""professional dreamers"" as Herzog calles them), and then even more so when Herzog gets away from McMurdo and visits various sites around Antartica. Given the opening statements about these ""cute marching penguins, I was in fact quite surprised that one of the segments in fact does visit the penguins, but of course on Herzog's terms, startling his interviewee (penguin scientist David Ainley) when asking ""I read somewhere that there are gay penguins. What are your observations of that?"", and also ""Do you think some penguins go insane?"". Shortly thereafter, we see a penguin wondering off in the wrong direction (on purpose, it is assumed). Throughout the movie, Herzog interviews people from all walks of life and how they ended up coming to Antartica. The last part of the movie shows a lot of gorgeous underwater footage (when divers ""go down into the cathedral"", as Herzog puts is). If you've seen other Herzog documentaries, you know what you are in for. I found this particular movie's tone very similar to Herzog's ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"" a year or two ago, and that is meant as a compliment.

There are a bunch of DVD bonus materials, the best of which by far is (on DVD2 of this set) the 65 min. interview of Herzog by fellow director Jonathan Demme, filmed in early 2008 in New York. It covers much terrain and I really enjoyed it. Bottom line: ""Encounters at the End of the WOrld"" is another outstanding Herzog documentary, and most certainly worth watching.

You'd be hard pressed to find a more beautiful tribute to Herzog/this movie.

---

Dear Werner,

You have done me the astonishing honor of dedicating your new film, ""Encounters at the End of the World,"" to me. Since I have admired your work beyond measure for the almost 40 years since we first met, I do not need to explain how much this kindness means to me. When I saw the film at the Toronto Film Festival and wrote to thank you, I said I wondered if it would be a conflict of interest for me to review the film, even though of course you have made a film I could not possibly dislike. I said I thought perhaps the solution was to simply write you a letter.

Without ever making a movie for solely commercial reasons, without ever having a dependable source of financing, without the attention of the studios and the oligarchies that decide what may be filmed and shown, you have directed at least 55 films or television productions, and we will not count the operas. You have worked all the time, because you have depended on your imagination instead of budgets, stars or publicity campaigns. You have had the visions and made the films and trusted people to find them, and they have. It is safe to say you are as admired and venerated as any filmmaker alive--among those who have heard of you, of course. Those who do not know your work, and the work of your comrades in the independent film world, are missing experiences that might shake and inspire them.

You often say this modern world is starving for images. That the media pound the same paltry ideas into our heads time and again, and that we need to see around the edges or over the top. When you open ""Encounters at the End of the World"" by following a marine biologist under the ice floes of the South Pole, and listening to the alien sounds of the creatures who thrive there, you show me a place on my planet I did not know about, and I am richer. You are the most curious of men. You are like the storytellers of old, returning from far lands with spellbinding tales.

The line between truth and fiction is a mirage in your work. I understand this. What must be true, must be true. What must not be true, can be made more true by invention. Your films, frame by frame, contain a kind of rapturous truth that transcends the factually mundane. And yet when you find something real, you show it.

In ""Encounters at the End of the World,"" you talk with real people who have chosen to make their lives there in a research station. Some are ""linguists on a continent with no language,"" you note, others are ""PhDs working as cooks."" When a marine biologist cuts a hole in the ice and dives beneath it, he does not use a rope to find his way back to the small escape circle in the limitless shelf above him, because it would restrict his research. When he comes up, he simply hopes he can find the hole. This is all true, but it is also ecstatic truth.

In the process of compiling your life's work, you have never lost your sense of humor. Your narrations are central to the appeal of your documentaries, and your wonder at human nature is central to your fiction. In one scene you can foresee the end of life on earth, and in another show us country musicians picking their guitars and banjos on the roof of a hut at the South Pole. You did not go to Antarctica, you assure us at the outset, to film cute penguins. But you did film one cute penguin, a penguin that was disoriented, and was steadfastly walking in precisely the wrong direction--into an ice vastness the size of Texas. ""And if you turn him around in the right direction,"" you say, ""he will turn himself around, and keep going in the wrong direction, until he starves and dies."" The sight of that penguin waddling optimistically toward his doom would be heartbreaking, except that he is so sure he is correct.

I have started out to praise your work, and have ended by describing it. Maybe it is the same thing. You and your work are unique and invaluable, and you ennoble the cinema when so many debase it. You have the audacity to believe that if you make a film about anything that interests you, it will interest us as well. And you have proven it.

With admiration,
Roger",1348963200,5,4413,4.403680981595092
3540812,3,B001DWNUD8,"Werner Herzog's career, the last couple of decades, has been far more focused on documentaries than on fiction films. His classic fiction films are almost all from the mid-1980s or earlier, whereas his notable documentaries are almost all since that era. Encounters At The End Of The World, a 100 minute long film, released in 2007, is among the very best of that later output. It follows the 2006-2007 austral summer journey of Herzog and his cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger to Antarctica.

  The film is, by Herzog's own account, not going to be like a National Geographic documentary, not like March Of The Penguins, a film that he despises. Many of the underwater shots had previously been used in Herzog's earlier film, The Wild Blue Yonder, a puzzling pseudo-science fiction mishmash. The scenes of light pervading under the ice is very reminiscent of the claims of Near Death Experiencers. Make no mistake, though, about this film- it is no mishmash- it cuts directly to the heart of Herzog's ideas of the cosmos: that it is indifferent, if not cruel, and that it often likes to torture the living. And, while the film shows these tendencies in nature, to a degree, it most definitely shows this in the inhabitants of Antarctica- the people of the largest American station on the continent, at McMurdo Station, in the Ross Sea. The station looks like something out of an 1890s Yukon Gold Rush mining town.

  Herzog seems to find most of them fascinating, but, if they are, it's in the hours of footage that Herzog likely spent interviewing many of the thousand or so summer inhabitants, because what is left on the screen is fascinating, only in the bizarre manner that one might have described Timothy Treadwell, the lunatic death wish idiot from Herzog's Grizzly Man as fascinating. Most of them come off as hermitic losers and loners, each with often bizarre traits that Herzog nearly fetishizes; and I do not declare it so negatively. This is an important documentary that details what exactly constitutes `extreme personalities.' Often the claimed background tales the people tell are more interesting than the people themselves. There are the requisite scientists, all of whom speak with passion and zeal of how their work is important to the world, but Herzog relishes the oddballs- a kid who runs the station's Frosty Boy pseudo-ice cream maker, and seems to derive an almost sexual pleasure from dipping his fingers into the mixture, as if a cool female pudenda. Then there is the American Indian plumber, with oddly shaped fingers, who claims descent from Incan royalty. In the DVD commentary, we find out from Herzog that he was electrocuted shortly after Herzog left the continent, and may not have survived. There is a woman who has had assorted adventures avoiding death on several continents, whose main pleasure in life seems to be the open mic night at one of the station's bars, where she crawls inside a carryon case and sticks her arms through holes she has cut out. She seems to be the station's resident comedienne. The station's bus driver also regales the viewer with tales of surviving a machete attack in the Yucatan. There are also odd moments with a would be philosopher and a linguist-cum-horticulturalist, but these encounters all seem to highlight the film's lone failing: Herzog seems to feel these people are far more interesting that they reveal themselves to be. Better editing of scenes to show this, or losing half the human `cast' would have made the film far more interesting, although it's plenty engaging as it is. There is a good deal of unwitting self-parody present, and whether this is immanent in the people, or part of Herzog's cruel streak (you have to love when he labels aerobics and yoga as New Age `abomonations', is beside the point. The film is better for the parody and cruelty because who else would care of these losers without Herzog's lens upon them- especially the nut who wants to go to Antarctica and set some bizarre sort of World Record in tumbling, or balancing a bottle on his head?",1339027200,2,4057,4.880986937590711

which gave a lot of information and the relevance of
the incredible extras. It is one of the most impressive films I have ever seen, the interviews with incredible interesting people, which is not just a question of luck of being at the right place with the right people, but the art sensitivity of Herzog of getting the most inner feelings and life philosophy of special people who decided to work in Antarctica. The scenes are beatiful, specially the ones undersea. Antarctica is

3540825,5,B001DWNUD8,"A compelling and different documentary-cum-societal critique as filmmaker Werner Herzog takes his team down to the mysterious southern continent, Antarctica, to film life on the edge, and people on the edge: practically, theoretically, environmentally, and even  psychologically!  That is to say, Mr. Herzog is here studying humanity itself, just as much, if not more, as he is examining the wildlife and incredible terrain of the forgotten continent.

  ""Encounters at the End of the World"" interested me right from the beginning, as Herzog demonstrates how scientists, academia, and governmental authorities will make mules out of themselves once they pass below 60 degrees south...  It is also a study in how much people, generally speaking, like to control each other...  Further it was revelatory of the  utter ridiculousness of some scientific theories, and perhaps even more broadly, and more disturbingly, of the modern scientific perspective, known as ""scientism"".  As a result of the latter very many people cannot see the hand of the Lord in His Creation, even given all their high learning, and technical brilliance.

  I consequently consider this a modern 21st century tour de force, as director Herzog, in 100 odd minutes of film, will explore the philosophical, cultural, and religious depths of man to as great, and as correct, a degree as very many volumes of books.  I believe that he in short sets a new standard in documentary filmmaking here; one of bluntness, honesty and truthfulness; that I have never quite witnessed before.  The accompanying music was as intriguing, and as unusual, as the film itself.",1325203200,,1629,5.263565891472868

3540828,5,B001DWNUD8,"This is a wonderful elegy of a film about Antarctica.  The director Werner Herzog goes to Antarctica to explore the continent and the people on it, not to make another film about penguins.  And yet, the most moving footage in it is about a penguin willfully deciding to set off on a march toward certain death, toward the mountains.  Seeing it the second time, I realized that this scene is so powerful because it plays like a fable.  Most of the penguins go to the sea to feed, a few go back to the nests, and one sets off alone.  That's the beginning of many of fairy tale too.  The film suggests that we are like that lone penguin, setting off with such determination towards destruction.

But Antarctica today is a republic of science.  The Enlightenment has found its home at the south pole.  Reason and science rule there now.  Voltaire would have wept with joy to see this film.  (This is not something I've thought about any previous film.)  But the republic is threatened with climate change, and the end, I find, is not so different in tone from the rest of the film if you are attentive to the undertone of the whole thing.  I almost could imagine that this was a trip to a sort of Weimar Republic before something terrible is about to happen.  But everyone there knows that the terrible time is coming.  All this will be destroyed, Herzog is saying.  Listen to him.",1298073600,,1377,4.469879518072289
3540829,4,B001DWNUD8,"Werner Herzog is a well known German documentary filmaker. His strength is his good taste in subject matter. This is a travelog of life in the Antarctic base maintained by the US National Science Foundation. The best parts of this movie are the spectacular views, especially the breathtaking underwater photography. Also the interviews with the offbeat characters who gravitate to this sort of lifestyle are excellent, and keep the movie from being just one more slick David Attenborough nature special. The editing sometimes drags - too much time spent on safety training - but still worth watching and gives a sense of what it's like to live and work in the remote Antarctic.

Unfortunately, Herzog as narrator is a bit full of himself. He starts off the film with a pompous and arrogant speech warning the National Science Foundation that this 'wasn't going to be just another penguin movie.' Later he goes on about the extinction rate of human tribal languages, which has nothing to do with the Antarctic. One senses there is no one in Herzog's world who can advise him to just remain silent and let the people he interviews speak for themselves.",1295308800,2,1150,4.897435897435898

Some exceptional scientific video-within-video: of microbes, icebergs, volcano caldera. Specifically wanted info on clothing and underground shelter / geothermal energy -- non given.

3540832,4,B001DWNUD8,"I was in McMurdo when this was shot and it was nice to see the old place again and some of the ex co-workers from the old days.

This is, as Werner states, not a cute penguin movie. This opens peoples eyes to the normal life there, as normal as can be in such a place, and lets others see how life can be in extremes as well as how dull things can get and the very diverse group who populate such a place not only for their own reasons but for the good of the planet as there has to be some place that all those odd people, myself included, can be put for a few months so the rest of the world can survive.

The importance of the greenhouse and Mr. Frosty is explained well though there is hardly a way to really appreciate how important it is to have something small and welcome when there are few other things that can be enjoyed, there are few who have known such isolation as being on the Ice during a comms outage and spending days waiting for a phone or e-mail to the outside world and in a way the effect of this life is caught a little in the eyes of those on camera and the softness of their voices, as if we speak ever lowly so as not to miss the voice of the Ice as it passes us by.

If you are interested in working or taking a cruise trip down then this is a great introduction to what to expect, rules as well as conditions, though he seems to have missed the parties and general revelry but he did capture the feel of freedom and the wonder of wanderers.",1280966400,4,1469,3.989795918367347

3540850,4,B001DWNUD8,"I have enjoyed Werner Herzog's films for a variety of reasons but the most compelling one is his willingness to go where no one else would think to go.  Whether it is to to tell an unusual story in the middle of the Amazon forest or to visit Antarctica to see what's there, Director Herzog is going to come up with a film worth watching.

As I understand the genesis of ""Encounters at the End of the World"", Herzog was sent some film of an antarctic undersea diver and took up his invitation to come and see more.  With the diver as an excuse to visit Antarctica, Herzog explored as much as he could to see what other stories might be worth putting on film.  He came up with a number of different characters, a few unusual occupations, as well as an inquiry to insanity among penguins.  The views of Antarctica are generally magnificent although I think Herzog intended his frequent views of the local community to show the negative visual contrast with the otherwise pristine beauty of frozen nature.  All the while, Herzog gives his narration with the occassional verbal wink to tell us that it's OK to laugh at this segment.  As the film came to a close, it may have been to soon for many of us to leave Antarctica but Herzog had made his point and completed his travelogue.  This is a good movie if you're not expecting too much.  I think that Herzog may have had the same opinion of Antarctica.",1275868800,,1399,4.43359375
3540851,5,B001DWNUD8,"Werner Herzog is a master filmmaker. Stretching back decades, genres, languages, styles and scope, he continues to be a pioneering creative force. Encounters at the End of the World is the newest reminder of his skill, and joins the growing list of ecologically/environmentally centered documentaries gracing us, the most famous being Davis Guggenheim/Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth.

Herzog's Encounters is a somewhat meandering trip to the Southernmost place on Earth, inspired by footage of Antarctica's marine world taken by a friend of his. From the early images of crammed passengers on a cargo plane to the buckethead testing of what to do to get to the outhouse in a blinding blizzard to absolutely stunning footage of underwater life to a wayward penguin's seemingly suicidal venturing into mountainous country, Herzog has fashioned together a commentary on life in one of our harshest environments and the quality and experience of what it is like. An ethereal, primal musical score accompanies the picture, which is narrated by Herzog, like his fabulous Grizzly Man, but more muted and ponderous.

But the film in not merely a Discovery Channel opportunity to remind us of the staggering beauty that rests so far away, so deep and unhospitable. Though the Discovery Channel produced or funded it, Herzog infuses, through interviews of people who find themselves shaken down to this vagabond paradise, a philosophical questing that appears both wonderfully progressive and positive, to his own harsh expression of human futility.

Some of the most remarkable aspects of Encounters are the aforementioned penguin scenes. While interviewing a scientist who has spent more time with penguins than people the last 20 years, Herzog tries to pry info to little success, though his interest in the sanity of penguins proceeds his footage of a wandering penguin breaking off from the instinctual directions of sea and enclave to head into the mountains. It highlights the headlong madness that has stood out in his oeuvre, both beautiful and frighteningly isolated.

3540854,5,B001DWNUD8,"As director Herzog says early on in the voice-over narration, this is not a film about ""fuzzy penguins.""  This is a beautiful, stunning film about Antarctica but especially about the people and creatures Herzog encounters in his explorations of the continent, from philosophers driving heavy machinery to a journeyman plumber who claims to be descended from Aztec royalty to penguins who seem to be wandering off into the unknown and to certain death.  Herzog seeks out and finds the unexpected and the amazing, and he does so with his usual deadpan style.  He focusses on the big picture as well as the small details, and if it doesn't all add up to a unified whole, at least it makes you think and leaves room for mystery.  If you enjoy nature films, you will enjoy this film; if you enjoy films about unusual people, you will enjoy this film; if you enjoy films that surprise you, you will enjoy this film.  I found it fascinating on many levels, and I highly recommend it.",1268179200,3,976,4.651162790697675

3540856,5,B001DWNUD8,"Werner Herzog warned the studio that he wouldn't make another movie on penguins.  He didn't keep quite his promise.  He actually did film some of them, concentrating on one individual that went totally berserk, heading for the mountains instead of the ocean full of fish, to a certain death...  Following Herzog this penguin had enough of the biting cold, the frozen wind, the endless day and the endless night.  You see this is undoubtedly a typical Herzog movie, where this time no imagination at all was required to create his fantasy world.  Herzog didn't had to invent Fitzcarraldo.  He just had to go out with his camera and interview the people he came across : linguists growing tomatoes in a world without languages, philosophers driving heavy machinery, scientists watching science fiction doomsday pictures, investigators playing rock music in the middle of nowhere, a glaciologist putting poetry into the movement of the Antarctic ice mass, a marine biologist pondering about the horrors of the undersea world...

This is by no means Herzog's best film--it jumps around a lot and sometimes focuses on characters who really aren't terribly interesting--but along with a great score it has enough entertaining moments, inspired photography, and memorable scenes to make it worth watching.

3540882,2,B001DWNUD8,"With this documentary Herzog's movies cover now every continent.
As in many of his last works he uses eerie music to make his point and some might consider this as a repetetive scheme. The scenes of diving underneath the ice are pretty but similar was shown in his 'The Wild Blue Yonder'. The music of the seals are beautiful though and the first hand reports about the effects of global warming are indeed very interesting. Personally I thought the helicopter ride over antarctica in the additional scenes actually the highlight of this movie.
The description of the arctic outpost sounds at times elitist,
the interview about gay penguins with a biologist is a sad farce,
the poor penguin running to his death gets mocked by Herzog's crew,
the necessary snow storm training makes people look like fools and
the story of a movie not about penguins doesn't really come to an fitting end.
I discussed this movie later and we all agreed that this documentary shows many of its topics really negative.
There seems to be an aversion to this place which the director passes on to his viewers, so could you possibly like it or any documentary about?",1253404800,5,1143,4.748743718592965
3540883,3,B001DWNUD8,"This is a movie about a group of scientists who travel to Antarctica to terrorize seals.  They claim that they are doing this for the sake of science, but I don't believe it.

For kicks, the scientists go looking for  mother seals who are nursing their babies.  When they spot a mother seal who is nursing her baby, they sneak up on the seals from behind.  And in a surprise attack, they place a Hefty bag over the head of the mother seal and they extract a ""milk sample"".  If the mother seal resists or struggles in any way, she is clubbed mercilessly by the scientists.
The scientists rationalize their behavior by claiming that it's not a big deal for the seals.  According to these scientists, the seals don't mind being attacked in this manner.

Since there are no laws in Antarctica, this type of activity is completely legal.

There is a strong anti-Bible message in this film. Both the Big Bang Theory and the theory of evolution are spoken of as if they are facts rather than unproven anti-Bible theories.

One scientist states that humans evolved on land rather than in the sea because our ancestors (who lived in the sea) wanted to escape the horrors of living in the sea, so they evolved into land mammals.  (Hopefully someday an artist/scientist will draw a picture of the first sea creature that flopped out of the sea and onto dry land, and eventually evolved into a human being.  Since we are mammals, it would probably look something like a dolphin.)",1248048000,2,1467,4.6
3540884,4,B001DWNUD8,"Antarctica is truly an alien world right here on earth, and this film does a good job of capturing underwater (under ice) video that is like nothing ever seen before. Who knew that seals talking to each other under the ice sounds exactly like a sound effect for a 50's sci-fi movie? I had already heard the alien sounds that whales make but this is the first time I recall hearing seals. Now, beyond the amazing footage we get a glimpse into the lives of the people who work and live in Antarctica..specifically McMurdo. This part (while interesting at times) could have either been left out or fleshed out more to make this a better documentary style movie. McMurdo does have some colorful characters, yet even their best stories and personal insights pale in comparison to the awesome landscape they are surrounded by. Overall, a good documentary style movie that could have been great. Werner Herzog should let someone else narrate his future films (he has a heavy accent, and monotone style) and when doing a documentary style film either concentrate on the landscape/wildlife or the people without trying to do both.",1246233600,,1121,4.84375
3540885,5,B001DWNUD8,"But in fact, there is one poignant extended scene about penguins and the one who, for whatever reason, chooses to head off across 5000 km of ice to certain death.  And, while the rule for scientists in Antarctica is not to interfere, even if they did the penguin would only set out on his doomed journey once again.

That scene is only one small slice of the wondrous and often weird  realities that Werner Herzog turns his camera to in Encounters at the End of the World.  A glance at the other reviews here shows a minority view, but to me it is impossible to watch this documentary without becoming suffused with joy and awe at the continent but even more at the fact that all this, including us and the very individual people working on the continent, has come to be and continues to unfold with destination -- as Herzog alludes to -- completely unknown.

The soundtrack enhances this continuing mystery, with chants and strings and even sounds of seals under the ice.  Only in an extended under ice water scene toward the middle of the movie does it become overbearing and detracting from the beauties the camera is recording.

As an aside, kudos to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for its  Antarctic Artists and Writers program that provided funding for Encounters.  If only all my tax dollars were so well spent.

The bottom line is simple -- make Encounters part of your permanent DVD library.",1243641600,3,1407,4.659919028340081
3540886,2,B001DWNUD8,"Having just come back from Antarctica, I was excited to see another documentary about the white continent. The film's cinematography was simply stunning in blu-ray. I loved the underwater shots, especially since that is a world few of us will ever see. If I had watched the movie on mute, I would have loved most of it.

However, the film's director, Werner Herzog (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grizzly-Man/dp/B000NNESB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grizzly Man</a>), does not give us that luxury. Instead, he provides a constant, uninformative, and simply stupid narration for much of the time. After seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grizzly-Man/dp/B000NNESB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grizzly Man</a>, I didn't have high expectations for Herzog, but even so I thought at points his narration was not only boring but outright rude and awkward. Several times after his interviews, he lets the camera linger on the interviewees, who often became visibly perturbed. When interviewing a few people at McMurdo Station, he asks them about their background, but then rather than letting them tell their story he drowns out their response and says something to the effect that their response is boring or too long.

For what is purportedly a nature documentary (even funded by the National Science Foundation), Herzog displays a shocking contempt for nature. He describes ""tree-huggers"" and ""whale-huggers"" as freaks and chastising civilization for caring more about them than the fact that human languages are disappearing. Frankly, most people (including Herzog) couldn't care less if a language spoken by one or two people disappears, but one gets the sense Herzog is simply trying to sound moralistic.

While I was fine (and even welcomed) the fact that Herzog's film wouldn't simply focus on penguins, when it did look at penguins it was almost a joke, more like what I would have expected from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farce-of-the-Penguins/dp/B000JJSJD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farce of the Penguins</a>. Herzog seems bored with his conversation about penguins with a field biologist, so he asks whether there are really gay penguins. He then goes into a 5-minute narration about penguins who supposedly become insane. Having spent a week watching penguins in Antarctica, I can testify that they are far more interesting than anything Herzog's film portrays. I was shocked that the NSF actually funded this film.

As I mentioned, the film has a few high points (notably the underwater photography), so it might be worth renting the film and skipping to those scenes or checking out the bonus features. However, if you want a real documentary about Antarctica, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-in-the-Freezer/dp/B000BJS4FS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life in the Freezer</a>&nbsp;- done by a true master, David Attenborough.",1243296000,16,3029,6.204761904761905

3540912,5,B001DWNUD8,"I have now seen this film twice, and I feel I need to see it a few more times to really penetrate it. The film, for me, addresses issues both grand and personal on many levels. The comment where someone said it is disjointed can be valid, on the first or second level of appreciation. But there is an overriding, and very profound harmony running through the whole film. The most ""disjointed"" aspect was not the presentation, but the not infrequent eruption of Herzog's personality or ego into the film, but even that I could appreciate, because the film is about asking big questions and not expecting big answers---right away. And our ego position in the universe or on the planet or in our culture is one of those questions.

What most impressed me about the film it that it made my attention pique, suspended it in anticipation. The first level of questioning is about the planet, ecological concerns. The next level of question is about the personalities that seek out this kind of environment.... but those do not make my attention pique. It was a subtle awareness of the grand, or the infinite with the finite that really began moving things around, and made me want more and more.

The greatest impact of the film is its subtler elements. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I, too, am a Herzog fan, and for me this went beyond his other films in its penetrating questions in a very subtle format.",1237680000,3,1406,4.62
3540913,3,B001DWNUD8,"Since other reviewers have adequately summarized this film, I'll skip straight to what I thought were the best and worst qualities of ""Encounters"":

BEST:

- The filming itself is brilliant, as you'd expect from Herzog.  The contrast beetween the spellbinding landscape and the banal living quarters of its inhabitants is striking.

- The interviews provide terrific insight into the passion and curiousity that is necessary to subject oneself to living, even temporarily, in the most inhospitable land on the planet.

- The footage of the Antarctic Ocean floor is truly otherwordly.  The creatures beneath the ""frozen sky"" are beyond even the most imaginative science fiction writers.

- There are approximately three hours of extra footage contained in the extra features on disc one and disc two, including segments of footage taken above and below the frozen surface.  There is also a 90 minute interview of Werner Herzog conducted by acclaimed director Jonathan Demme, which is very interesting and, for me, worth the price of admission.

WORST:

- The film's interviews are often laden with scientific jargon that I suspect will alienate a general audience. I found the content of the interviews fascinating, albeit completely over my head.

- As other reviewers have noted, the interviews with the so-called ""commoners"" that were not in Antarctica for scientific study were too short.  I felt that insufficient time was spent on telling their stories.

- While many of Herzog's observations and contemplations are fascinating, they never seem to connect to a larger theme or thesis. This lack of intellectual focus makes the landscape itself the focus of the film, and ultimately overwhelms Herzog's encounters that gave this film its name.  I believe Herzog's intent was for these encounters to leave an impression on his audience, but it failed to do so for me.  Perhaps if the contents of the interviews had built off of one another and arrived at a larger lesson or thought, something other than the landscape shots would have stuck with me.

Overall, I found the film to be inexcusably unfocused, leaving little else other than the setting to be admired.  Herzog has done better than this. I call this film surreal, rather than poignant, as so many of his films have been.  In any case, I have high hopes for his next project.",1236297600,32,2338,5.044270833333333
3540914,5,B001DWNUD8,"Words cannot express the stunning beauty, vastness and magnificence of the Antarctic landscapes. I have always been fascinated by this enigmatic land, and Mr. Herzog's film did not disappoint. Of course, Mr. Herzog loves to examine eccentric behavior (Grizzly Man, anyone?), and those who populate the McMurdo Station are often the target he loves. There's no question that he admires these people, but many are there for worldly reasons, beyond the science of it all, and it's all relevent. The interview with the man who escaped from Russia with his life (and little else) was paricularly touching. Zeroing in on the work that those people do is especially interesting. So much more to say, but suffice it to say Mr. Herzog has found another location that is a character unto itself. The scenes studying Mt. Erebus were quite fine.  The DVD I saw was only a single-disc version, but had the extras ""Over the Ice"" and ""Under the Ice"". Both were especially intriguing. I enjoyed this film perhaps more than most. I wonder why documentaries are never nominated for cinematography... this was a stellar achievement, on many levels. Even Zog's snide comments didn't bother me too much, because there was eventually a magnificent vista to behold to take your breath away.",1235433600,3,1267,5.004739336492891

I don't think I would fare so well with such a project, but somehow this documentary completey succeeds on all levels.  There might be a boring moment there, a boring moment here, but overall the film is very interesting from beginning to end.  While interviewing people this guy doesn't hold back at all, he goes right to the meat of whatever the matter could be, regardless of whether while doing so he sounds insane or not.  I have a great amount of respect for that.  And Anarctica is a beautiful place, one that definetely attracts its fair share of interesting folks as well.  I'll definetely be buying this one, fully recommended.",1234915200,,846,4.8
3540916,4,B001DWNUD8,"The  scenery is breathtaking and surreal. The animals that inhibit this land grab our attention and inspire our imagination with its peculiar shapes and abilities (glowing in the dark always does). The human subjects of this documentary all have peculiar and intriguing stories to tell (and some choose not to). Documentary filmmaker Werner Herzog brings all these elements together in ""Encounters at the End of the World"". The stories fostered in this documentary all have one thing in common, the south pole. Yet, they all seamlessly blend together to create a somewhat ethereal nut raw account of life at the south pole.

The human stories are peculiar because they represent the average person, but one who decided to test the extremes and go to the end of the Earth, literally. The stories presented are so perfectly narrated that they are engaging and makes us want to experience the south pole for ourselves. Nature is presented as beautifully surreal, violent and still yet ever-changing.

For me, it was pivotal to the experience of the film to realize that this beautiful scenery was being savaged by the effects of global change. It all seemed to fragile and unstable considering the seeming undisturbed permanence of the Antarctic ocean and the creatures that inhabit it. Through this documentary, Herzog manages to document the often solitary and altogether surreal life in the Antarctic in a way that is spellbinding, making the experience altogether real. Why the three stars then? It felt a bit long.",1234224000,,1516,5.080321285140562
3540917,4,B001DWNUD8,"""Encounters at the End of the World"" is the latest in a long line of outstanding documentaries by German director Werner Herzog, a filmmaker who knows how to take the raw material of nature and turn it into art.  Herzog was so moved and impressed when he saw some underwater footage taken off the coast of Antarctica that he felt compelled to head south to record his own unique vision of that part of the world.  The result is a movie that is part pure aesthetics and part hard-edged science - part poetry and part prose.

The poetry comes in the stark beauty of a frozen landscape, extending as far back as the eye can see - or in the spellbinding eeriness of an underwater world inhabited by strange and exotic creatures never before seen by the human eye.  The prose can be found in the drab and ""functional"" National Science Foundation headquarters, which with its clapboard buildings and dozens of caterpillar tractors tearing up the countryside, possesses all the beauty and splendor of a strip mining operation.  The prosaic also finds voice in the daily routines of the men and women who live and work there, as they spend their off-hours eating in cafeterias, going to bars, playing guitar, watching old science fiction movies on T.V.  In fact, Herzog seems almost more interested in trying to figure out what makes these particular individuals ""tick"" than in recording the wonders of the world around him.  Much of the time is spent interviewing these intrepid souls, trying to determine why they have chosen what is probably the most brutally harsh and least habitable spot on the planet to call home.  Herzog discovers that while some, of course, have been brought there for purposes of scientific research, others, explorers and drifters by nature, seem to have simply run out of any more places to explore and drift to.  Herzog doesn't really give us a chance to get to know any one individual in depth, but the brief comments we do get are often eye-opening and fascinating to say the least.

Of course, Herzog's film is at its richest and most compelling when it is focusing on the almost indescribable beauty of the place and the creatures that inhabit it.  Like a master painter, Herzog uses his camera - and the musical score by Henry Kaiser and David Lindley - to create art out of the basic elements of nature and life.  We watch breathlessly as the camera glides ever so slowly along the bottom of a frigid bay, the myriad fascinating creatures that thrive there going about their business beneath a roof of rock-solid ice.  Even something as simple as air bubbles, forming and reforming themselves into endless gelatinous shapes as they lay trapped under the ice, becomes a vision of unsurpassing beauty.  There are moments of great poignancy, as when a disoriented penguin races inexorably and inexplicably towards the interior of the continent to face certain doom - and of great excitement as a team of biologists discover a hitherto unknown species of fauna on the ocean floor.

 He also includes a generous helping of clips from Shackleton's breakthrough expedition in the early 20th Century, and even takes us into the little ""museum"" that has been set up in commemoration of the event.  We also travel along with a group of volcanologists as they explore a nearby crater, then head to the actual South Pole where we find an assortment of trinkets set up in permanent display in an underground tunnel there - almost like a time capsule frozen in ice for some future species or perhaps some extraterrestrial visitor to our planet to one day discover.  Finally, we listen to the otherworldly sound of seals and seal lions as they swim and go about their lives under the ice.

And over all this lies Herzog's narration, which at times borders on the portentous, as he sternly reminds us that our reign as a species on this planet may soon be coming to an end.

Although there are countless moments of awe-inspiring wonder in the film, it is the constant juxtaposition between the ethereal and the mundane that gives ""Encounters at the End of the World"" its own distinctive raison d'etre.",1232236800,,4114,4.767605633802817

Really?  Pushing an agenda here, thankfully the scientist clued him in that animals do not go against nature( or against God, only sinful man is capable of such deviant sinful behavior).  The only redeeming ....moment....is when a penguin heads toward the mountains....disoriented, mentally challenged?, on a mission, away from food and nest and survival, but he heads to the mountains ...impending doom.  Allegorical to the scientists flocking to Antarctica.  Herzog is a genius after all.",1510617600,,932,5.299319727891157

8295115,5,B001DWNUD8," at least that is what Werner Herzog proclaims, on the military airplane out of New Zealand to the largest base in Antarctica, McMurdo. There is actually a 10 minute segment in this almost two hour movie on penguins  so, Herzog meant, it will not be primarily about penguins. That 10 minute segment is one of the more poignant portions of the movie. Herzog interviews one of the penguin experts, Dr. Ainley, on location, asking him questions such as: have you observed homosexual behavior in penguins? The answer is not really; the expert observed some three-way behavior and even some transactions that might be considered prostitution. Then Herzog asks if penguins might have psychiatric problems. He receives an equivocal answer. Later he films six penguins walking towards the ocean; its feeding time. Four continue, one turns back, and the sixth one turns, and starts walking inland, to a certain death, a lone penguin walking into the vastness. Herzog adds that it is the protocol NOT to interfere with penguin behavior; apparently that has been violated in the past, with the result that the penguin, once reoriented, would simple turn, and walk inland again (giving up on life?).

Herzog narrates his own films, with a wonderful mellifluous timbre to his voice. He is both wry and incisive in his observations, for example: McMurdo is run in the spirit of a correctional facility, but the people are actually decent. McMurdo is a grim looking place, due to the lack of vegetation  as are other near polar towns. Herzog says that it contains such abominations as a yoga studio, bowling alleys and ATM machines.

Some 30-40% of the movie are people that he interviews, professional dreamers as he calls them. Jan Pawlowski sequences DNA, and based such on the takings from one dive, identifies three new species  a cause for celebration. Sam Bowser is a diver, with a grizzly beard, doing his last dive, ready to pass the baton to the younger generation. He is a sci-fi buff, and makes frequent apocalyptical remarks. Dr. Gorham waxes enthusiastically about neutrinos and how they truly do represent a different dimension, and how Antarctica is one of the best places to attempt to identify these elusive sub-particles. Due to political instability in the Congo and Ethiopia, the only other two places that have volcanos that go directly into the earths magna, the safest place to observe this activity is in Antarctica. True to Herzogs range of interests, he does not just interview the experts with Dr. in front of their names. He does lengthy interviews of the bus driver as well as a machinist whose finger lengths are very unusual because he is of Royal Aztec blood.

The cinematography is brilliant. It is such a pleasure to view the landscapes; the underwater cinematography is exceptional, setting this movie apart from others on the land really down under. Most is filmed in the blue natural light under the ice, and who would have thought that jellyfish, that torment swimmers in the Mediterranean, would flourish (beautifully) under the ice! Herzog does not overlook the history, filming Shackletons original hut, still preserved, and splices in some historical footage of the early explorers.

I first became acquainted with Herzogs work in the 1970s. After a four decade hiatus, I recently become re-acquainted when I viewed his movie about another end of the world sort of place:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-People-A-Year-in-the-Taiga/dp/B00CHIM6M8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy People: A Year in the Taiga</a>.
