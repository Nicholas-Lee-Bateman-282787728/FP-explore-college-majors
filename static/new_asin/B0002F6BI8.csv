2091813,5,B0002F6BI8,"To begin with, the main reason I purchased the VCI Film Noir Double Feature Vol. 2 dvd was because I wanted a better-restored version of ""The Chase"". The Alpha dvd I owned of that movie was virtually unwatchable, and I was glad to see that VCI had vastly improved the picture quality. Although there's about a 60-second scene in the movie where the picture is terrible, other than that it's very clear. Unfortunately VCI could not fix the annoying audio problems with ""The Chase"" and that was a letdown, yet I doubt you'll ever find a better print of this movie anywhere. The same thing happened with ""Bury Me Dead"": impressive picture quality, terrible sound quality. Still, VCI did their best to restore these two underated noirs, and the bonus features make up for the poor audio quality of the films.

First, we have the bizarre, dreamlike ""The Chase"" from 1946, based loosely on Cornel Woolrich's novel _The Black Path of Fear_. Robert Cummings stars as Chuck Scott, a penniless WW2 veteran who happens to find a wallet filled with cash. But because he's a ""sucker"", he returns the wallet to it's owner, who happens to be Eddie Roman (Steve Cochran), a wealthy gangster. Eddie's right-hand man Gino (Peter Lorre) doesn't like or trust Chuck, but Eddie does, and he hires Chuck as his new chauffer. Chuck likes his new job but soon falls for Eddie's beautiful wife Lorna (Michle Morgan), who desperately wants to escape her mean and violent husband. The next thing you know Lorna and Chuck have fled to Havana, Cuba, with Gino (and other henchmen) hot on their trail.

Several murders later, we find out that the whole thing's been a nightmare in the troubled mind of Chuck. By the end of the movie the viewer doesn't quite know what to believe, except that this is clearly the most bizarre film noir ever made! I'd already seen this movie twice, but I never understood it entirely until I watched it with the commentary by Jay Fenton. Of course, there were some oddities in the movie that even he couldn't explain! I can understand why many viewers might not enjoy this movie, but I love it more everytime I watch it. The acting was excellent, not just Robert Cummings and Michle Morgan but also Steve Cochran and Peter Lorre, who always played villians to perfection.

""The Chase"" is unusually violent, even by 1940's film noir standards. There's two scenes where women get slapped or punched, one where a man gets killed by a big dog, one with a woman getting stabbed, two scenes of people getting shot, and one with a car getting destroyed (with two people inside) by a speeding train!

Next, we have the odd noir comedy ""Bury Me Dead"" from 1947. June Lockhart stars as Barbara Carlin, who near the beginning of the movie attends her own funeral (how noir is that?!?). All she knows is that another woman is burried in her grave, and someone had tried to murder her. Now that her husband Rod (Mark Daniels), family lawyer Michael Dunn (Hugh Beaumont), and adopted sister Rusty (Cathy O'Donnell) know that she's alive, she carefully recounts the previous days (via flashbacks) to see which one had the best motive for trying to kill her. She trusts the family lawyer, but Rusty hates her and Michael had been having an affair with another woman, so she watches her back. It isn't long before another attempt on her life is made, and this time the killer won't mistake another woman for Barbara...

""Bury Me Dead"" has a fine mixture of humor and suspense, but the thing that really makes it special is John Alton's incredible cinematography. This low-budget ""B"" film noir was one of many released by the short-lived Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) during the mid-1940's, and in spite of the awful audio quality the movie is very entertaining. I first saw Cathy O'Donnell in ""The Best Years of our Lives"" and she was just as impressive in this, and both June Lockhart and Hugh Beaumont give exceptional performances. The bonus features are awesome and include several noir trailers, a poster gallery (which strangely includes many of Rear Window, a movie I've never considered to be a film noir), optional commentary with both movies, and biographies/filmographies of the main stars of each movie. You probably won't find better-quality prints of these films anywhere else, so I highly recommend this well-priced dvd for fans of film noir.",1121212800,34,4350,4.786950732356858
2091814,4,B0002F6BI8,"2 strong B noir contenders on one disc, well packaged and presented.  Jay Fenton's commentary is sometimes useful and sometimes obvious, the extras are a great bonus.

Bury Me Dead is part of an odd sub-genre I would call comic noir, the motifs and themes are the same but it's full of jokes, puns, and wisecracks.  Also tries to be trendy by dragging psychoanalysis into the plot to no advantage.  June Lockhart is pleasant enough to look at but, to quote a review of a more famous actress, her emotions run the gamut from A to B.

For the price and the rarity of these titles, this is a great addition to one's noir collection.",1111449600,12,629,4.434782608695652
2091815,4,B0002F6BI8,"This dvd contains 2 films: THE CHASE (1946--85 min.) starring Robert Cummings, Michelle Morgan, Steve Cochran, and Peter Lorre. This is a pretty good movie about a guy who finds a mobsters' wallet, returns it to him, becomes the mobsters' chauffeur, then becomes dangerously involved with the mobsters' wife. A little on the surreal side but still a good film. This film is said to have the most dreamlike atmosphere of all the noir titles. The audio and video quality is pretty good also. Before the film starts, there is an explanation of how difficult the restoration was. It talks about finding only 1 good print and dealing with a soundtrack that had sprocket holes in it. I think they did a very good job of cleaning this film up and bringing it up to par for DVD audiences. The audio during the opening titles of this movie isn't too good, but it clears up once the story starts. This is the better movie of the 2 in my opinion.

The second film is BURY ME DEAD (1947--68 min.) starring  Hugh Beaumont, June Lockhart, and Cathy O'Donnell. This is an OK film about a woman who shows up at her own funeral then tries to find out who wanted her dead. The audio and video quality on this film is not too bad. The clarity is somewhat soft and the audio has some static here and there. This is probably the best print of this film available. Let's remember that this was just another B movie that was made by PRC, a poverty row independent studio. We're probably fortunate that this film still exists.

As extras, there is a commentary on both films by Jay Fenton, a noirish Superman cartoon titled SHOWDOWN (1942), some film noir posters and trailers, and a 25 minute film called DEATH BY PROXY which is a condensed version of BURY ME DEAD. This looks to be a 16mm film bought from a catalog for home viewing years ago.

All in all this is a pretty good disc, especially for the price. This may very well be the best presentation that both of these films get on DVD.",1097712000,52,1968,4.428176795580111

8027709,2,B0002F6BI8,"Bury Me Dead was of interest only because it featured June Lockhart. Story itself was pretty bad.

8027712,4,B0002F6BI8,"THE CHASE  Finally a decent print of this overlooked gem. The picture quality of this restoration is, comparatively, excellent (considering the options we've had in the past!). The sound has a slightly annoying ""hiss"", but this is tolerable and soon goes away because of the crisp clarity of the original soundtrack itself. So--the print is OK on this interesting well-done Cornell Woolrich story...and talk about atmosphere and MOOD!yum yum

BURY ME DEAD has a fairly good premise but the film itself very quickly deteriorates untill it becomes annoying and tedious and laughable. Definitely not one of PRC's finest...",1246665600,,619,5.3061224489795915
8027713,2,B0002F6BI8,"I found both of these to be rather dull & boring, it seems like any Noir outside of the major studies & is a public domain/VCI or Alpha noir are kinda flat..
I cant recommend either unless you are a noir completest and must own them. This is the VCI print and its good, but the movies werent",1214352000,2,291,4.0344827586206895
8027714,4,B0002F6BI8,"I have long supported the B category film noirs. Often they are as entertaining or more so than the A product. The stories are straight forward without having to stop for star turns. VCI and other companies releasing these films should be applauded for the efforts made. Having said that, I feel bad about having to give a downward thumb to ""Bury Me Dead."" It's the first title I've collected which I feel is a letdown. The acting is terrible as well as the pacing. I am a big fan of Hugh Beaumont, who was a very fine actor, with a highly likable aspect to his personality. He always turned in professional efforts as an actor. Here he is as flat as the rest of the film. I have to say that the film's final 10 minutes are really quite good as is the fade-out moment involving three of the characters. ""The Chase,"" on the other hand, made the purchase worth while. It is a very well made film noir. Robert Cummings was a light comedienne who could do the job in turning in a solid sober performance. What worked against him was a softness in his delivery. But he was another very likable type and gives a good account of himself in ""The Chase."" Steve Cochran is always good especially in the number of films where he was teamed with Virginia Mayo. Who could forget the smoldering sexuality between the two in WB's ""White Heat?""
I highly recommend this film noir set for ""The Chase.""",1203292800,4,1383,4.40625
8027715,5,B0002F6BI8,"It has a convoluted plot which leaves a number of questions unanswered but if you don't mind  dreamy, impressionistic films, The Chase may be for you.  I found it an outstanding (though atypical) example of the noir style and hard to forget.  As explained in the DVD notes, this VCI edition is probably the best quality possible given the flawed source print.  The 2nd film on this double feature disc, Bury Me Dead, is a so-so ""comedy noir"" featuring June Lockhart and Hugh Beaumont.  My rating applies only to The Chase with no deduction for the substandard video/audio which apparently can't be helped.",1174694400,5,605,4.834951456310679
8027716,1,B0002F6BI8,"VCI's offering of The Chase is, as I understand, a superior transfer of this little known title. They have remastered the copy from the best surviving prints. There is a notice at the outset of the movie describing the techniques, materials, and film stock used for the restoration. It is well packaged, and includes a nicely printed liner booklet. All of this attention to detail begs just one question. Why bother?

Although initially excited about seeing a movie that had escaped my orbit, the enthusiasm quickly waned by the end of the first reel. The characters in this movie are not simply ""underdeveloped,"" they're non-existant. We know or learn very little about these people until the very end, and consequently care nothing about them. Bob Cummings, a fine actor whose career and accomplishments are widely unknown and vastly underrated, portrays the WWII veteran, Chuck Scott. Clearly uncomfortable with the material, Cummings acts as though he's having a tooth pulled throughout the movie. Peter Lorre's character, Gino,  is constructed with all the acumen of taking a Bentley to the McDonalds drive-thru, so poorly developed and written are his scenes and dialogue. Steve Cochran's Eddie Roman is acceptable only in that he actually has fewer lines than his hench-man, Lorre does. Michele Morgan's Lorna Roman, is unappealing and unbelievable as the thick-tongued French-immigrant gangster's moll.

The story, or lack thereof is a hodge-podge so randomly executed we must simply accept a new set of circumstances and rules with each scene. Speaking of rules, as in the ""rules of filmmaking and storytelling"", this movie breaks far too many to be taken seriously. Our suspension of disbelief is violated instantly, and throughout the entire film. The plot leads us from one point to another as though we are in posession of the the shooting script. During the final reel, the filmmakers try to convince us that everything we have witnessed has been a dream or hallucination. Chuck's delusion, or the explanation of said event, is a perfect example of a broken rule. His experiences within this delusion are taking place parallel to, and concurrent with actions, characters, and events apart from his own. It is presented as though the screenwriter and director didn't want to bother with annoying trivialities like continuity. We are deprived of an ultimate confrontation and conclusion to the affairs, with the gangster's demise played out in a contrived fate that would be more appropriate in a hackneyed weekly serial...which is apparently all the time that was required to explain the actual plot of this movie.

In keeping with the tone of the film, the liner notes and synopsis are a collection of uninformative vacuous thoughts and platitudes as nebulous and poorly conceived as the movie itself. The ""author"" reminds us that Michele Morgan received the Best Actress award for Symphonie Pastorale, at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival, as though the two performances had some relationship. However, he fails to mention that Ms Morgan had washed her hands of Hollywood after filming The Chase, returning to Paris for good. He also claims, ""one way to suggest a dream-like atmosphere is to soften the glow or exaggerate the contrast and color, like the often ambiguous and dreamy paintings of Maxwell Parrish.""  Huh...???!!!  I don't know who Maxwell Parrish is, but  famed American Illustrator, Maxfield Parrish painted colorful fantasy art, and nursery rhymes. He also informs us that throughout cinematic history, filmmakers have been unable to successfully produce dream-like movies. Apparently, somebody forgot to mention this to Val Lewton and Jacques Tournneur. Obviously, the author is as confused about film history as he is about art history.

There are a few dark shots and set-ups in The Chase, with the most effective lighting, photography, and settings taking place inside Roman's estate. However, this is not some ""little gem"" of a film-noir classic. It is a disjointed, poorly written and badly told story on all levels. The only surprise here is seeing Cummings, Lorre, and Morgan, agreeing to act in this amateurish effort. Who knows, maybe the best stuff was left on the cutting room floor. It had all of the elements ""on paper""... Likeable WWII veteran, mobster and beautiful unhappy wife, Peter Lorre as a heavy...

Now imagine Edward D. Wood Jr. writing and directing it, and you have, The Chase.",1143763200,9,4431,5.16016713091922
8027717,3,B0002F6BI8,"Of the two films on this DVD, ""The Chase"" is the one really worth watching.  It boasts a great cast (boyish Robert Cummings, French star Michele Morgan, and the unique Peter Lorre) and an interesting, dreamlike narrative adapted from a Cornell Woolrich novel.

""Bury Me Dead"" starts off well, with a woman attending her own funeral, but, despite cinematography by the great John Alton, the film then becomes a rather conventional whodunit with a surprising amount of wisecracks thrown in and no star appeal.

As for the DVD, the sound and image are terrible in both cases.  I almost gave up when I first tried to watch them, but ""The Chase"" was interesting enough to make me glad I purchased this, especially since it seems unlikely either film will merit a ""Criterion Collection""-style release.  The DVD also includes numerous extras, but be warned that the image and sound are downright awful.",1141430400,8,895,4.900662251655629
