8514885,5,B007D3LB3W,"A superb training DVD. Sifu Ken Gullette goes into tremendous detail on this form, which is quite long. This DVD provides views from multiple angles as well as provides step-by-step walkthroughs on each posture and transition. I believe that this Hsing-I Sword Form comes from the Zhang Zhaodong Lineage of Hsing-I Ch'uan. Zhang Zhaodong taught the illustrious martial arts master and scholar Jiang Rong-Qiao, whose writings continue to be a central part of Internal Martial Arts study today. I definitely recommend this DVD.",1511740800,,525,5.337349397590361

This video is AWESOME and worth the price.  You get you moneys worth and more.  Don't think twice about getting this video, just get it and have fun learning like I am doing.  Great value for the price.  I say that he Ken Gullette is getting rip off by us for the price he is selling it at.  Very AWESOME video.
