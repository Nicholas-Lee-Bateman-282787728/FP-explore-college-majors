It  sunk in some places and could degenerate into a slipshod performance  weighed down with mediocrity and preachiness. Yet there were sufficient  spurts of activity and charm to keep the movie alive.",965088000,,344,5.0
8194067,5,6302075254,"This program is one of the most informative programs I've ever seen about bears.  It introduces a fascinating array of information about the different kinds of bears found in the continental U.S., and more  importantly, their outlook for survival.  The photography, narration, and  music are extremely well-done (as are the interviews with Gary Brown, a  former ranger at Yellowstone and a bear expert).  As an educator, I think  students everywhere can't help but take away an important lesson from this  program:  that natural resources like bears must be protected if we want to  keep them around.",949190400,,600,5.15625
