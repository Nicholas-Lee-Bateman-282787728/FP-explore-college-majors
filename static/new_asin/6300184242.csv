217092,4,6300184242,"This movie was easily brushed aside by the simultaneous release of ""West Side Story"" in 1961 and is often overlooked next to other Rodgers and Hammerstein greats, but don't cast this one away just yet.  Although one of  R&H's lesser known works, and understandably so, it's still adequate  entertainment for a lazy Friday night.  The story follows a young Chinese  picture bride Mei Li (Miyoshi Umeki) who comes to America to marry Sammy  Fong (Jack Soo), a night club owner with eyes for his star attraction  played by Nancy Kwan.  When he tries to rid himself of his betrothed, enter  Wang Ta (James Shigeta) whose father is eager to marry him off.  It's easy  to see a love triangle forming, proceeded by a rectangle and a pentagon,  but nothing a bit of singing and dancing can't mend.
All is well until  the last third of the movie when the cat-and-mouse game of love becomes  clear to all and the mostly three-dimensional characters quickly collapse  into cardboard puppets scrambling to tie up plot danglers.  Matters of the  heart aren't as tidy and easily-resolved as the story has you believe.  Yet  this simplicity is part of its charm.
It's safe to say that ""Flower Drum  Song"" falls miserably short of R&H's two other Asian-themed musicals,  ""The King and I"" and ""South Pacific.""  The singing is good but the songs  are forgettable, save a few jazzy dance numbers (""Chop Suey"" and ""Grant  Avenue"").  Jack Soo's brilliant reprisal of his Broadway role stands out  among the satisfactory acting.  His carefree nightclub owner is a perfect  blend of sarcasm, anxiousness, and good-hearted intentions.
Asian  Americans will consider this a hit and a miss.  Credit the team for  introducing *normal* American-born characters, especially in 1961, (one  scene has a Chinese cop boasting, ""Sorry, ma'am, but I can't read Chinese,""  and another includes an energetic song-and-dance number where the  American-born kids cajole ""The Other Generation"") as well as for assembling  Hollywood's first all-Asian cast-no yellow face and taped eyes here.  Despite this, things aren't helped by the much-accented heroine, a naive,  gentle blossom plucked from her distant homeland and smuggled ashore with  her protective father to start a new and prosperous life in America.  In an  overwhelming attempt to create wholly assimilated characters, R&H  overreach their goal by inserting such ""old fashioned"" characters for  contrast, in effect reinforcing the foreigner stigma.  Add to that the  sultry night club theatrics of Nancy Kwan which heavily fuel the  eroticizing of Asian women.
Nevertheless, Asian Americans will find  familiar aspects and when the lights come up, ""Flower Drum Song"" is an  enjoyable movie for every musical fan.  Just forget it's a Rodgers and  Hammerstein leftover.",964828800,4,2788,5.157303370786517
217093,3,6300184242,"I agree with a previous comment that said this is one of Rodgers and Hammrsteins most underated musicals,and its too bad it had to be released the same year as West Side Story!  Although almost 40 years later,  Flower Drum Song may appear dated and just slightly chauvinistic, it is  none the less a charming  'multi-cultural' piece.  I am a huge James  Shigeta fan from way back and prefere him as a leading man instead of a WW  II villian. Myioshi Umeki(sp) is absoulutely delightful as the mail order  bride,and Jack Soo and Nancy Kwan as the comic/romantic team are super....  My favorite number is ""Don't marry me"",but ""You are  beautiful""...well... I am sorry I don't remember the names of all the  super supporting cast, other than Patrick Adiarte and the younger son.(And  didn't he play the Prince in ""the king and I"".  A real gem of a  musical that somehow gets lost in the shuffle... Definitly in my top ten  list!",958953600,16,925,4.6234567901234565
217094,5,6300184242,"Flower Drum Song is R&H's most underrated musical... not their best musical (that honor must go to ""The King and I""), but a very enjoyable film  for the whole family.  Flower Drum Song is a lighthearted  musical comedy set in San Francisco's Chinatown about old-fashioned Chinese  and modern Chinese-Americans clashing over tradition and trying to find  romance.  It features Rodger's brassiest and jazziest score and the best  choreography of any of their musicals.  Some of the more memorable songs  include: ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"" (with that famous three-way  mirror scene), ""Love Look Away"", and ""Don't Marry Me"".  In its ""modern"" language, hairstyles, costumes, and attitudes,  the film also captures the look and feel, the optimism and exuberance of  that early sixties/Kennedy era perfectly.
Flower Drum Song was unusual  not only because it featured an (almost) all-Asian cast, but also because  it depicted Chinese-Americans as _Americans_: a Chinese-American  businessman, college student, banker, policeman, standup comic, yes, even a  Chinese-American showgirl.  Although the characterizations are not very  deep or serious, the film is a fine showcase for some early Hollywood Asian  acting talent:  Nancy Kwan is gorgeous and is great in all those dance  numbers; Jack Soo has a hilarious deadpan humor; James Shigeta is a real  heart-throb, and Miyoshi Umeki is as sweet as can be.
Look for a brief  cameo by Richard Rodgers during the ""You be the Rock"" number!",943401600,64,1476,5.29004329004329
217095,3,6300184242,"This is grade B Rodgers and Hammerstein, but that means it's VERY competent and certainly enjoyable to watch once or twice.  After that it is just boring.  Filmed in Panavision for Universal (the only R&H film  not produced or distributed by Fox)the film's one saving grace is the  borrowing of Alfred Newman/Ken Darby to orchestrate and score the musical  and dance numbers (as they did for the Fox R&H musicals).  The score is  pleasant but the orchestrations make it seem far more memorable than it is.  Unfortunately, no one in the film can act and the director is lethargic  in his pacing.  The show and the film are curios.  What was timely in 1959  when the show premiered on  Broadway for 600 performances and in 1961 when  the film was released, is now very dated.  R&H never had much success  with contemporary themes in their musical comedies (virtually everything  they wrote after THE KING AND I - 1951).  The film DOES go on (for two and  a quarter hours).  The dream ballet is completely rethought (originally an  act one finale equivalent to OKLHAHOMA!'s ballet where Laurey has to make  up her mind), no longer Wang Ta making up his mind between Linda Low and  Mei Lei, but a strife torn Helen Chao haunted by her impossible love for  Ta.  The ballet is well choreographed and danced (as is the delightful  SUNDAY number).  This is like the cliche about Chinese food - tastes great  while your enjoying it but an hour later you're hungry again.
The film  earned five Oscar noms: Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes, Sound,  Scoring butlost  out to WEST SIDE STORY.",914371200,2,1585,4.716911764705882
217116,5,6300184242,"What can you say about a 1960's Hollywood view of San Francisco's Chinatown and the intergenerational issues of that time.  Hate to say this but those issues are pretty similar today, of course without all the singing.  Interesting to have some Japanese Americans play major roles in a film dealing with Chinese American culture, but that's Hollywood in the 60's.

If you really know the culture of weddings, a lot of that stuff really doesn't happen.  But it's fun to look at and see where my dad's store was with some real parade footage along Grant Street (okay, they call it Grant Avenue and that works better in a song). Overall this is a fun movie and glad that it's on DVD.",1515628800,2,680,4.549180327868853
217117,4,6300184242,"This is a handsome production of a minor Rodgers & Hammerstein musical - their only real musical comedy in the ""Guys & Dolls"" mold. The plot is a bit creaky - mixed up lovers end up engaged to the wrong people. But the subject is the American immigrant experience with some in the old world, some in the new, and a lost generation caught in between. Though it's set in contemporary (at the time) Chinatown in San Francisco, the struggle has been faced by Polish, Jewish, Irish, and every nationality to arrive here.

In order to enjoy this you have to excuse some poor motivation for the lovers and a few jokes that seem to parade orientals around for the amusement of white folks. (What can you do? It reflects the 1950s when it was written.) On the other hand, it's a big Hollywood studio film that is cast almost completely by Asian actors. (Don't forget, this was the same year that Mickey Rooney was playing Chinese in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and George Chakiris won an Oscar for playing Puerto Rican in ""West Side Story"".) So that is something.

And what a cast! I wouldn't change a single one. Jack Soo and Nancy Kwan are the night club owner and his star attraction - both might be seen as oriental to white people, but they are as American and modern as Dean Martin and Marilyn Monroe. But the core of the piece is Miyoshi Umeki as Mei Li, the wide-eyed mail order bride and James Shigeta as Wang Ta - the first born son of a prominent Chinese American family who is trapped between his traditional father and the new country he has been raised in. Shigeta has movie star looks and personality which makes him the believable love object of three women. And Miyoshi Umeki is the heart of the story - she lets us inside this optimistic and naive girl who believes all the American promises she has heard.

The reason the film endures is a combination of the quality of the actors, the first rate costume and set design, and those R&H songs. If the film seems to dip at times during the dialog, the songs pick it back up. The dream ballet to ""Love Look Away"" may be giving us 10 minutes with a minor character we don't care all that much about - but the song is one of the team's most beautiful and the scoring by Alfred Newman is spectacular. Ditto for ""Sunday"" - a fantasy of married American life, and the comic ""Don't Marry Me"" - a witty anti-love song Jack Soo gets as he tries to shed an unwanted lover.

Is it ""Oklahoma!"" or ""Sound of Music""? No. But it's also not a silly cheap film out to make a quick buck. It's a charming romantic comedy that's trying to take audiences to a community they might not normally get a glimpse into and expand storytelling beyond the white majority. I think that makes it worth a look.",1515628800,2,2732,4.393280632411067
217118,5,6300184242,"The best thing about this is the 'Flower Drum Song', and the actress performing it so beautifully; next would be the funny 'Don't Marry Me' song. The worst is the song and dance number during the parade scene, and the dream sequence dance. This move was made a long time ago and uses stereotypes of Asians and American-Asians that might be considered offensive today. But it is a romantic love story so the characters are portrayed lovingly if unrealistically.",1515283200,,460,4.8354430379746836

This movie presents several transitions in the plot: youth into adulthood, old world into new world (Chinese into American), dependency into independence. Also central to the story are many dichotomies: young/old, male/female, traditional thinking/modernization, honorable behavior/not so much so.
Add to all that - it is a great comedic production, drawing on script and choreography both to create a humorous backdrop for the multiple opportunities for verbal, physical, and situational humor to thread through the entire movie. Very family friendly.

The SF Chinatown of the 1950's is very different from the Chinatown of 2016!!!1  I love the story line and the music.  The set designs were exquisite and paid tribute to the rich Chinese cultural heritage..

217416,5,6300184242,"I like the movie. Some people don't. If you stop watching after half an hour you miss one of the best parts - Love Look Away - song and dance routine. Nancy Kwan's bit I enjoy being a girl was also quite good. It is a matter of taste what one does and does not like.

The movie was not popular when it was released, because the cast is all Oriental and WWII was still on the minds of many Americans. Note: the lead male actor played the boss in the first Die Hard. The guy hardly aged in 31 years.

What I look for in reviews is the quality of the product not whether you liked the show. There was only one review that I scanned that addressed anything about the product. It was a complaint that the movie cannot be fast forwarded. Without other similar reviews one can't tell if the playing machine was a problem or the movie disk is.

I can find reviews of the musical anywhere.",1422748800,,880,4.1345029239766085

217459,3,6300184242,"It was a second rate show on Broadway, saved by gorgeous staging, and the film is just shrill and second rate. There are a couple of terrifc songs, but compared the other R and H film screen adaptations this one lacks quality. Rodgers and Hammerstein were stunned by the shows original success, and they always called it their 'lucky' hit. The orchestrations are lush and give some of the second rate material a real boost, but it just doesn't have the lustre of the teams other work. And the less said about Jack Soo the better. 'Love Look Away' is a lovely song that should be better known, but 'Chop Suey,' 'Grant Avenue', 'I Am Going to Like It Here','Sunday' and 'Fan Tan Fanny,' are just dreadful. It's on a par with the second version of 'State Fair.'

Thankfully, the producer begins the story with the arrival in San Franciscos Chinatown of May Li and her father, street musicians searching for a certain individual to sponsor them in America. The film production and chorography of music and dancing sequences were magnificent. The actors were marvelous in their parts, bringing C.Y. Lees novel to life on the big screen.  Although I enjoyed the second half of the book, which is basically the movie, the musical is what I will always remember.

217496,5,6300184242,"I saw this movie as a teenager on television in black and white and thought it was a rather mediocre movie. After seeing this movie again on DVD in all its glory, I'll have to say that I found the movie thoroughly delightful.  I've read that there were a lot of criticisms of this movie through the years from the Asian community because of it's inaccuracies and stereotypical portrayals of Asians.  Instead of accepting a cute Broadway production brought to screen as entertainment, I think one might be a little over zealous in dissecting a piece of fluff.  If one is looking for realism, the characters wouldn't be singing or dancing in the first place.  No matter how rich, a home in San Francisco Chinatown will never look like Master Wang's.  All these are Hollywood's production value to bring beautiful visuals onto the screen.  When viewing R&H musicals, there requires a certain amount of suspending of belief and enjoying it as a genre and a movie.

Now to the Asian part.  As an Asian, I only found two things that bothered me on my initial viewing.  One is Miyoshi Umeki whose speech and mannerisms are ultra Japanese.  I do love Miyoshi though, for her parts in Sayonara, and The Courtship of Eddie's Father.  James Shigeta  and Jack Soo fares much better because they're so very Americanized that it is easier to accept them as Chinese.  Nancy Kwan and Benson Fong are both great, being actual Chinese actors.  Juanita Hall is not Chinese or even Asian, but she has great chemistry in her scenes with Benson Fong so I love her in it also.  The second thing that bothered me was my preconceived notion of a flower drum.  This do exist in certain parts of China and the drum is usually hung on a shoulder belt down to the waist where it gets beaten by two batons.  So the R&H's version of a flower drum took getting used to.  But in reality, a flower drum would not be sung to a tune of ""A Hundred Million Miracles"" anyway, so I learned to accept this as part of the Broadway musical world.

Finally as a piece of trivia, there is a continuity goof in the picture.  There were actual footage of a Chinese New Year parade in Chinatown San Francisco intermixed with parade footage shot at the Universal sound stage.  Miss Chinatown Irene Tsu was seen at the actual parade in her Miss Chinatown tiara and robe on a float where minutes later she is seen without her robe acting as Miss Chinatown sitting in a different car.  The only explanation for this is that Irene enjoyed the parade so much that when her float got to the end, she jumped on a different car after taking her robe off and went through the parade again!",1395532800,7,2631,4.506329113924051

217622,3,6300184242,"This screen play was rated 3-stars only because of its historical value.  Flower Drum Song was the first all-Asian Broadway play and Hollywood movie.  That aside, there are many elements that may have worked as a play, that do not work as a movie.
The music is FORMULA Rogers & Hammerstein.  There are no really memerable songs.  As I recall two of the songs had some very minor popularity; but, unless you are older then me (and I am on Social Security), you will probably not have heard them. The movie was incongruous because western music and Gene Kelly coreography was used to portray traditional Chinese song, dance and harmonies.  This incongruity was most evident in the scenes of the Chinese New Year's Parade.  The visual images of the parade were fairly authenic; however, the music overly dominated the scenes, and, was that of a classic Western marching band - even when local Asian marching bands with Asian instruments were marching by, and, during the dragon lantern sequence. The scenes ended with a 1950s Gene Kelly dance routine.
The movie was sucessful in showing that the American Chinese community was just as American as the Irish, Italian and other cultural communities, even if it was oblivious to traditional Chinese song, dance and music.  It also showed that there was a lot of hidden and unrecongnised talent amoung American ethnic Asian entertainers.",1296864000,,1380,4.9480519480519485

When I saw FLOWER DRUM SONG,I was eight years old, I knew that when I grew up I would go there. yes I love that movie. Aside from being musical, it was funny romantic and serious in certain parts a huge pagage, I am here to say that at that time in the sixties that is how it was excluding the music in the streets, unles it was their holiday. it was run only by the asians..restaurants, police, and so on. to go there was like walking in a different world, a world that i love, and miss going..so yhea unless you was married in the family and you was not an asian whould be the only reason you whould be there. I love all the music sung in this movie..It made me feel happy inside.
but that's me, I love romance with a twist. I have seen movies from all the actors after ""FLOWER DRUM SONG"" all have done great movies, but I'm partial to the ladies, they were acting till very old...and still beautifull..still standing tall...YOU GO GIRLS. sadly all the men are gone eccept for the younger ones.

217639,5,6300184242,"Finally the underated Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical gets the DVD treatment and it is worth the waiting. The transition from stage to screen does requires some adjustments to keep the flow of the story interesting and to work on screen, and Flower Drum Song is no exception. Several songs were omitted and sequence of songs were changed to suit the film and somehow it doesn't really affect the story too much. Some original cast from the stage are retained in the film version like Miyoshi Umeki, Juanita Hall, Jack Soo and Patrick Adiarte. James Shigeta and Nancy Kwan are the new faces to the film.
It is interesting to see a musical on the Chinese community in America and though the plot doesn't run well in today's society, it is endearing to see how an immigrant community blend with the western culture and society.
Songs are very much in the R&H style and it fuses 60's jazz and pop with traditional Broadway material and resulting in a very light yet sophiscated music and lyrics. Popular tunes from this musicals includes 'You Are Beautiful', 'Love Look Away'. 'I Enjoy Being A Girl', 'Chop Suey' and 'A Hundred Million Miracles'.
Chereography by Hermes Pan is excellent and there are several production numbers like 'Grand Avenue' , 'Look Look Away Dream Ballet' and 'Sunday' are well produce and top notch to the costumes, set designs and the overall production design.
Bonus and extra materials explains the origin of the story and how the transformation from a book by C Y Lee to stage and to film took place. The commentary by Nancy Kwan is nice too.
This is the only Rodgers and Hammersteins's musical that doesn't get much revisited on stage, even the revival in 2002 didn't get the accolade it deserves. Perhaps it is the story that doesn't transcends well with time.
But with the DVD release this gem of a deserving musical will prolong its life in musical history.
A definite peony in the garden of musicals.
This is a must in my collection of musicals on film",1278979200,5,1984,4.720461095100864
217640,4,6300184242,"OK.so it ain't ""The King And I"".""Flower Drum Song"" is still solid,entertaining Rodgers and Hammerstein. This film version is good,but definitely not up to ""King""
and ""The Sound Of Music"".Think more ""Carousel"" and ""South Pacific"".The movie has two major problems. Joseph Fields's script is,as it was on Broadway,dated and full
of stereotyped characters,for one thing. The other is that producer Ross Hunter and director Henry Koster try hard,but it's clear they did not know how to make a major movie musical. The film is slow-paced and at times more like just a photographed
Broadway show. Still,there are enough good things to recommend the movie. The Alexander Golitzen-Joseph Wright-Howard Bristol sets and Irene Sharaff costumes look great in Russell Metty's gorgeous Technicolor photography. The cast is very good
(Nancy Kwan and Miyoshi Umeki steal the show).And best of all is that lovely R&H score,
expertly done under the brilliant direction of maestro Alfred Newman. So overall,
this is a typical 1960s musical that provides good fun.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flower-Drum-Song-1958-Original-Broadway-Cast/dp/B00000J28P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flower Drum Song (1958 Original Broadway Cast)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flower-Drum-Song-1961-Film-Soundtrack/dp/B00006JKCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flower Drum Song (1961 Film Soundtrack)</a>",1276819200,,1442,6.928571428571429

217646,5,6300184242,"I begin my editorial offering about this classic in honor of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
 Rodgers'and Hammerstein's 1958 stage musical about assimilated and non-assimilated Chinese in mid-20th century San Francisco( based on a book by C.Y. Lee) alternates between reverent Eastern manners, and a modern America style.
 For me it brings to mind thoughts of a childhood partially spent in Hawaii where I romped, played, encountered, and was under the authority of the Sino-American population there. It is possible that I first saw this film back then(most likely a Christmas Day airing), and the scenes of Wang San(Patrick Adiarte) and the two ponytailed and dungareed girls who came to visit him bear some familiarity to scenes of my formative years.
 Our tale begins as one Dr. Li (Kam Tong) and his daughter, Mei Li (Miyoshi Umeki reprising her Broadway stage role) arrive in San Francisco as stowaways on a ship from Hong Kong, the smuggled-in guests of the Celestial Gardens Nightclub owner, Sammy Fong (Jack Soo), who wishes to bring Mei Li before the Family Council as a bride for Wang Ta( James Shigeta) the oldest son of the wealthy and venerable Wang Che-Yang(Benson Fong), a widower with two sons, and a sister-in-law, Madame Liang(Juanita Hall) who attends citizenship school and helps raise her two nephews.
 But Sammy's mother, Madame Ten Fong (Soo Yong) would prefer the filial and traditional Mei Li as a bride for her less-than-traditional son, which causes complications in his relationship with his lead dancer, Linda Low(a lissome Nancy Kwan).
 Dr. Li and his daughter begin their time as guests in Chi Yang's house, and Mei Li reprises the flower drum song she used to attract attention and solicit help in  finding Sammy's nightclub while still wandering the streets for her host, who is enchanted by it.
  Wang San teaches his female guest American slang. But Mei Li is attracted to his older brother, who in turn, has attracted the attention of Linda, whose pretty and assertively feminine musings are captured in the now-classic number, ""I Enjoy Being a Girl!"", sung by B.J. Baker.
 We watch Chi-Yang reluctantly accept a few Western customs, and stand baffled at the antics of his completely Westernized younger son, and feeling very dismayed by his older son's love life. Shy Mei Li wonders where she fits in, and among those affected by Ta's reckless indecision  is the seamstress, Helen Chao(Reiko Sato) whose wistful and dramatic fantasy sequence, ""Love, Look Away"", is voiced by Marilyn Horne.
  We share joyous moments with the ensemble, such as the celebration of Madame Liang's graduation from citizenship school and of Ta's from college, in which both graduates and their guests reflect on America's complex society in the song, ""Chop Suey"" in which  San really cleans up  as the lead dancer, and later to Linda's celebratory performance to ""Grant Avenue"" during the Chinese New Year's Day parade.
 But we also observe Linda's scheming, in which she employs the help of  Celestial Gardens' second-rate comic, Frankie Wing(Victor Sen Yang) amid her frustrated desire to marry Sammy,as well as Sammy's scheming to break up Linda's and Ta's relationship. During a cordial moment between the often-sparring lovers, a third fantasy number, ""Sunday, Sweet Sunday"", while occasionally striking one as overdrawn, captures this in a chaotically comical way.
 The passive and seemingly unassuming Mei Li proves herself to be clever enough to acheive her heart's desire, to the satisfaction of all involved, just when it appears that those meant to be together may lose each other forever.
  Tiki Hanelei, who played Ping Pong, the butler in another 1961 release, ""Blue Hawaii"", is seen among the extras as one of Ta's college buddies, and George Chakiris, who did pretty well himself the same year as Bernardo in ""West Side Story"", is among the dancers at the graduation party.
 While there may be some controversy about ethnic stereotypes, this ground- breaking film, the first to feature a predominantly Asian cast, is still a treat after nearly five decades, and it beautifully reminds us that in the end ""the other generation"" will eventually find its way.",1266105600,2,4191,5.099415204678363
217647,5,6300184242,"I first saw this play in the 1950's in an open theater in southern California. All I remember was the song and sitting among palm trees.

This play or musical is based on a novel by C.Y. Lee. Very well adapted for the screen by Joseph Fields and Oscar Hammerstein. They made everything look smooth and natural. Even the surrealistic scenes seemed like stepping into the persons head.

There are several other dimensions to this movie such as the characters are played by well know actors such as Nancy Kwan, Myoshi Umeki, James Shigeta, Benson Fong, and Jack Soo. To add to that are many memorable songs such as ""A Hundred Million Miracles"", ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"", You Are Beautiful"", and ""Love Look Away."" Most of the scenery is of stage play quality.

The basic story is a lot of love triangle overlap In San Francisco's China Town where eastern and western culture clash. We also have generation clashes. Seems like everyone is mixed up as to who loves whom. So will they be able to straighten this out? Will we learn anything about love and family in the process?

The special edition DVD has all the standard goodies as interviews with actors. The voice over commentary has mostly Nancy Kwan talking about her role in ""The World of Suzie Wong.""

217749,5,6300184242,"""The Flower Drum Song"" hasn't always been treated kindly by history.  Its (almost) all-Asian cast, though not all Chinese, and its mishmash of cultural authenticity and blatant stereotypes have meant that it never really took its place on stage with the famous Rogers and Hammerstein musicals.  It took a long time for this one to get a DVD release, long after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oklahoma/dp/B000AP04NI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oklahoma!</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music/dp/B000AP04OM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music</a>&nbsp;had already gotten the deluxe treatment.

And admittedly, it is a little odd.  The story of a Chinese mail-order bride stowing away on a freighter ship, only to find that her promised husband is a swinging hip cat with an eye for showgirls, is a decent foundation.  The clash between cultures, with the old generation still demanding their rights and the Americanized youth wanting to just play baseball and be hip, is an old story and one that all immigrant populations face.  A serious topic in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dim-Sum-A-Little-Bit-of-Heart/dp/B000BRBABA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dim Sum - A Little Bit of Heart</a>, it isn't the usual setting for an all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza, but somehow it works just fine.

Umeki Miyoshi is Mei Li, the bride in question. Umeki was the first Asian to win an Oscar, for her role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sayonara/dp/B00005LOLD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sayonara</a>, and is unquestionably a star.  She is dressed up like a China Doll, and plays the smiling traditional Chinese girl that the older generation thinks of as perfect.  Her counterpart, Linda Low, played by the sexy Nancy Kwan hot off her turn as a prostitute in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-of-Suzie-Wong/dp/B0001ZWLTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World of Suzie Wong</a>, is a striptease dancing girl who likes using her beauty to get money.  For two girls there must be two boys, and we get Jack Soo, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barney-Miller/dp/B00008EY6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barney Miller</a>&nbsp;fame, as Sammy Fong, the nightclub hipster who does his best Dean Martin impression, and James Shigata as Wang Ta, the shy and traditional boy.  Of course, all the girls are in love with the wrong boys, and all the boys are in love with the wrong girls, and that is where the hijinks ensue.

As a musical, ""The Flower Drum Song"" has some great numbers, and some so-so ones.  The stand out tune is ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"", done to perfection by a voice-dubbed Nancy Kwan dancing before her bedroom mirrors.  This song is quite famous, although divorced from this musical, and has become a standard for drag queens everywhere.  Another famous tune, ""Chop Suey"", sung by Juanita Hall in full yellowface, just didn't do it for me.  ""The Other Generation"" sounds like it was supsiciously recyclled for The Sound of Music's ""How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?"".  Considering the subject matter, one would think that there would have been more of an Asian influence on the music, but it is all just pure showtune glory.

Allthough it took a long time for ""The Flower Drum Song"" to get a DVD release, they made up for it by giving it all the extras.  A pristine transfer that balances all the colors beautifully, and a bunch of interviews and bonus materials all make for a nice package.",1215043200,4,3710,6.08637236084453

With one exception (the song ""Chop Suey"") the score is well-written. It has great art direction and costumes and these, as well as other aspects of the film were nominated for Academy Awards (they lost to West Side Story).  The commentary is also very interesting.

217753,4,6300184242,"This is one fun movie.  As musicals go, it is also a very unusual movie in that the cast is 100% Asian.  It's the story of an arranged marriage gone awry.  Jack Soo's traditional Chinese mother arranged it and he doesn't want it.  So he tries to unload the sweet little, illegal stowaway from China off on Benson Fong as a potential wife for his son, played by James Shigeta.  Myoshi Umeki as the stowaway is as cute as ever.  Benson Fong is hilarious as the ""square"" old Chinese father who is out of touch with his Chinese American kids.  The songs area  lot of fun.  Though the song ""Chop Suey"" is touted as a classic, I personally don't get why.  Other songs in the movie, Flower Drum Song, I Enjoy Being a Girl, The Other Generation, Don't Marry Me... are much better.  This film also has the typical, obligatory nightclub number (Fan Tan Fanny, in this case) that seemed to be a standard in musicals of this time period.

The other actors are excellent as the modern ABC (American Born Chinese) Asians clash with the cultural values of the old world.
An ""Oceans 11"" attitude and film that at times reminds you of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" in between all of the great musical numbers make for a very entertaining film. Wonderfully acted, colorful and full of old time style make this a must see.

As an english-speaking person of chinese descent living in Asia, I feel compelled to say that I do not find the movie politically offensive at all. Sure there are send-ups of some of the more exotic things about the Chinese, but it's all done in good spirit. Besides, some of the wackier stuff is true anyway!!

217863,5,6300184242,"Finally the underated Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical gets the DVD treatment and it is worth the waiting. The transition from stage to screen does requires some adjustments to keep the flow of the story interesting and to work on screen, and Flower Drum Song is no exception. Several songs were omitted and sequence of songs were changed to suit the film and somehow it doesn't really affect the story too much. Some original cast from the stage are retained in the film version like Miyoshi Umeki, Juanita Hall, Jack Soo and Patrick Adiarte. James Shigeta and Nancy Kwan are the new faces to the film.

It is interesting to see a musical on the Chinese community in America and though the plot doesn't run well in today's society, it is endearing to see how an immigrant community blend with the western culture and society.

Songs are very much in the R&H style and it fuses 60's jazz and pop with traditional Broadway material and resulting in a very light yet sophiscated music and lyrics. Popular tunes from this musicals includes 'You Are Beautiful', 'Love Look Away'. 'I Enjoy Being A Girl', 'Chop Suey' and 'A Hundred Million Miracles'.

Chereography by Hermes Pan is excellent and there are several production numbers like 'Grand Avenue' , 'Look Look Away Dream Ballet' and 'Sunday' are well produce and top notch to the costumes, set designs and the overall production design.

Bonus and extra materials explains the origin of the story and how the transformation from a book by C Y Lee to stage and to film took place. The commentary by Nancy Kwan is nice too.

This is the only Rodgers and Hammersteins's musical that doesn't get much revisited on stage, even the revival in 2002 didn't get the accolade it deserves. Perhaps it is the story that doesn't transcends well with time.

But with the DVD release this gem of a deserving musical will prolong its life in musical history.

I've never seen FDS on the stage but I've seen the others on stage and screen.  And while R&H  musicals are better on the stage, I can't offer that opinion on this one since I've only seen the movie (well part of it anyway).

I rented video (VHS tape) about 10 years ago and I couldn't make it beyond the first half hour.

R&H were noted for being ahead of their time when it came to issues like women's rights and racism, but somehow they forgot everything when it came to ""Flower Drum Song"".

If you're into 1950's Asian and Female stereotypes, then perhaps you might like this.  I'm not and I was very disappointed. I stopped watching after about 30 minutes.

The film is about Mei Li, played by Miyoshi Umeki, who comes from Hong Kong to the United States for an arranged marriage with a night club owner played by Jack Soo.  But he already has his eye on Linda Low played by Nancy Kwan, a modern gold digger who is willing to do anything to get that gold ring on that empty finger.  So he tries to dump Mei Li on an old fashion family looking for an old fashion girl to marry the eldest son played by James Shigeta.

There is also Helen Chao, played the lovely Reiko Sato, who has a job, has loved the eldest son for years, isn't interested in money or marrying just to get married and guess who ends up without a man in the end?

I am familiar with the other 6 R&H movies, but I never saw this one all the way through before, and it sure never looked or sounded like this on TV.

Like the song, ""Chop Suey,"" this is a mixed plate, but the overall effect is delicious. The cast is charming, with the wonderful Oscar-winner Miyoshi Umeki repeating her Broadway triumph in the central role. The score, though not top-drawer R&H, has several gems--""A Hundred Million Miracles"" and the haunting ""Love, Look Away"" are particularly beautiful. The real star of the film may well be Alfred Newman, whose orchestrations and arrangements make everything shimmer. And those Dong Kingman title paintings are simply gorgeous.

Let's all thank Universal for (finally) doing such an outstanding job of restoring and preserving this little winner for us, and for all the future ""other generations"" as well. Hooray!",1163289600,13,1000,4.842105263157895
217971,5,6300184242,"I'm not sure when I started to hound Universal Home Video about releasing this gem on DVD, but thank goodness I was heard, as well as many others from all the reviews of this new issue.  This is my second favorite R&H film version musical behind SOUND OF MUSIC.  Absolutely love the score, and always remember how charming this film is, so revisit often when I am in a foul mood or need a R&H fix.  It was the only R&H musical film that still didn't have a DVD home, when all others have had at least one or two runs via Fox Home Video.  I was lucky to tape the last broadcast of this film in widescreen, but it cut off the end titles a bit, so it was never complete, plus I have Universal's Pan and Scan VHS edition that is long out of print.  Well, Universal has made up for it with this release.

The remastering of picture and restoring the original technicolor is phenominal, especially focusing on Dong Kingman's lovely paintings that are part of the titles.  I didn't imagine 5.1 Surround was possible, as it was advertised in 2.0 Stereo, but was happily surprised to see 5.1 listed on the packaging when I purchased it.  The great overture sounds superb with Surround going.

As mentioned by other reviewers, there is a great amount of extras that explain how the story got to Broadway in 1958, then the 1961 film, then forgotten, and then revived by the new story and presented on Broadway in 2002.  I still would like to see a revival of the original Broadway version to compare it to the movie, as all I have is the Cast Recording.  Still, nothing can take away the charm of this film, and the great performances of Nancy Kwan, Jack Soo, Miyoshi Umeki, Juanita Hall, Benson Fong, Reiko Sato and all the rest.  During Nancy Kwan's commentary, it was sad to learn of some of the cast who are no longer with us, especially when they left us so young (Reiko Sato in particular, and Jack Soo who left us during his Barney Miller tenure).  Nancy also mentioned she has been chosen to narrate a forthcoming documentary on Dong Kingman's artictic work.  Only thing missing from the extras are trailers for the film, but in this case, ""So what?""  Though not specified as such, this 45th Anniversary celebration is great!  Maybe at 50 in 2011, another edition will be shared with a few more treats.  If not, I'm glad for what we have right here.

217972,4,6300184242,"As a Japanese-American raised in the 1960's, I always had mixed feelings about the 1961 film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Chinese-American musical comedy. Although it was refreshing to see so many Asian faces in a mainstream studio movie (granted several Japanese-American actors in Chinese roles), the portrayals always struck me as trite and catering to pre-existing stereotypes. Now that it has finally come out on DVD forty-five years after its initial release, I can appreciate it much more without raising my eyebrows as much, perhaps because it now seems so much a nostalgic product of Eisenhower-era sensibilities. Another reason is that the DVD contains a pristine print that balances the saturated use of color throughout. Moreover, there is the music, which while not grade-A material from the legendary team, has enough of their recognizably melodious style to make the whole affair quite entertaining now.

Set in San Francisco's Chinatown in the late 1950's, the souffl&eacute;-light story, written by Joseph Fields, is a family-oriented, musical-chairs romantic comedy focused on East-West cultural differences primarily in the well-to-do Wang household headed by the ultra-traditional Master Wang. It starts with pretty Mei Li, who has stowed away on a Chinese steamer with her professor father to become a mail-order bride for nightclub owner Sammy Fong. En route, they end up staying in the Wang home where she develops a crush on eldest son Wang Ta. But he is infatuated with saucy showgirl Linda Low, who is intent on making Sammy jealous enough for him to propose after five years of non-commitment. Wang Ta and Linda turn out to be a mismatch, which would be good news if only Mei Li's marriage contract were not so binding. If that situation is not complicated enough, dressmaker and doormat Helen Chao has a lifelong crush on Wang Ta as well.

An all-Asian cast was assembled, a rarity in itself back then, and it helps that most perform within the constraints of the movie quite well. Looking like a porcelain doll brought to life, Miyoshi Umeki lends her uniquely plaintive quality to the role of Mei Li, and she sings with quiet clarity on her trademark song, ""A Hundred Million Miracles"". As Wang Ta, James Shigeta, also a pleasant singer, is sincere with the matinee idol looks to match, although his nave character seems excessively dim when it comes to women. Both, however, are overshadowed by the shenanigans provided by Nancy Kwan, at her pin-up cutie peak, as Linda, and Jack Soo in full Dean Martin mode as the cynical Sammy. Even though their stormy relationship seems to be lifted completely from Nathan and Adelaide's in ""Guys and Dolls"", they provide the lion's share of the entertainment with the domestic fantasy, ""Sunday"" a particular highlight.

While dubbed, Kwan performs the boudoir classic, ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"", with sexy flair, and she dances with graceful exuberance on ""Fan Tan Fannie"" and especially on ""Grand Avenue"" with a virtual battalion of dancers. Benson Fong, who memorably played Charlie Chan's #3 son in his youth, brings the necessary bluster to Master Wang, while Juanita Hall, Bloody Mary from ""South Pacific"", stays mainly on the sidelines as the understanding Auntie Liang except when she solos on ""Chop Suey"". Of the supporting cast, two performers stand out - teenaged Patrick Adiarte dancing energetically as younger son Wang Tan, and as the lovelorn Helen, Reiko Sato leads a stunning ballet on the show's best song, ""Love, Look Away"" (her voice is dubbed by legendary soprano Marilyn Horne). The opening credits showcase a series of striking watercolor paintings from artist Dong Kingman, and Russell Metty's richly colorful cinematography can finally be appreciated with the DVD.

The 2006 DVD extras are generous starting with a solid commentary track from Kwan and British film historian Nick Redman. Even though Kwan sometimes gets derailed by her life story, she and Redman partner well in bringing out intriguing aspects of the production and cast. There are five featurettes which feel like components of one feature-length documentary since the same participants show up in all five. The first one talks about the story's transition from the original novel by C.Y. Lee to the Broadway musical directed by Gene Kelly to the 1961 movie to the 2002 Broadway revival developed by David Henry Hwang. The other shorts focus on the casting, the score, sets and costumes, and a more personal look at Rodgers and Hammerstein. It's interesting how veteran filmmaker Henry Koster is barely mentioned since he directed the film, though his pedestrian direction is truly the least impressive part of the movie.",1162857600,19,4688,5.132198952879581

217999,5,6300184242,"The Broadway show of ""Flower Drum Song"" was considered minor Rodgers and Hammerstein but when it hit Hollywood it exploded across the screen like a string of Chinese firecrackers.

The story may seem to be feathery light but with colorful sets and costumes and the impeccable cast and the delightful score, the movie is eye and ear candy for all.

Miyoshi Umeki as Mei-Li the mail order bride sings ""A Hundred Million Miracles"" and ""I Am Going To Like It Here"" winsomely and lovely but she proves she can be a cut-up when she plays the perfect foil to Jack Soo during the ""Don't Marry Me"" comic duet.  Nancy Kwan as the gal with the heart of tin, although her voice is dubbed, is all perky and bright as she performs her big numbers ""I Enjoy Being A Girl"" ""Fan Tan Fanny"" ""Grant Avenue"" and the hilarious dream sequence with Jack Soo, ""Sunday""

Reiko Sato as Helen Chow whose secret crush is unaware of her feelings sings(dubbed) and dances the heartbreakingly beautiful ""Love Look Away"" and Ballet.

There is also a comedy number called ""Chop Suey"" which details the varities and confusions of life in America for newly arrived immigrants and segues into a sort of Asian dosey-doe square dance.

218001,5,6300184242,"Actually, there must be 101 million miracles happening every day, because FLOWER DRUM SONG is finally being released on DVD.

One of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most joyful musical offerings,  the story (based on C.Y. Lee's novel ""The Flower Drum Song"") concerns a winsome young Chinese girl called Mei Li (Miyoshi Umeki) who enters the United States illegally, in order to submit into an arranged marriage with San Francisco nightclub owner Sammy Fong (Jack Soo).  Complications arise when Madame Liang (Juanita Hall) decides that Mei Li would instead be better-suited to her nephew Ta (James Shigeta), but he is infatuated with nightclub star Linda Low (Nancy Kwan), who is also Sammy's on-again, off-again girlfriend.

This being one of the greatest Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, you can count on a satisfying conclusion with lovers matched and happy endings for all.  The score for FLOWER DRUM SONG was one of the most accomplished written by the duo, with numbers running the gamut of emotion (Mei Li's pragmatic ""A Hundred Million Miracles"" and the simple, inward melody of ""I Am Going to Like It Here"").  The songs of Mei Li contrast very effectively with the knowing and brassy numbers of Linda Low (""I Enjoy Being a Girl"" and ""Fan Tan Fanny"").  The plight of the Chinese-American is perfectly analysed in ""The Other Generation"", and in ""Chop Suey"", the number Madame Liang performs at the party celebrating her American citizenship.

FLOWER DRUM SONG opened on Broadway in 1958, and ran for a very successful 600 performances.  Miyoshi Umeki (who won an Academy Award for her touching performance as Katsumi Kelly in SAYONARA) thankfully got to reprise her Broadway role of Mei Li in the film, with Jack Soo, Juanita Hall and Patrick Adiarte the other main hold-overs from the stage cast.  The singing voices of Nancy Kwan (Linda) and Reiko Sato (seamstress Helen Chao) were both dubbed; Kwan by B.J. Baker; and Sato, most notably, by the up-and-coming opera star Marilyn Horne.

The film version of FLOWER DRUM SONG greatly benefits from some fabulous musical numbers choreographed by Hermes Pan (""Fan Tan Fanny"", ""Grant Avenue"" and the striking imagery of the ""Love Look Away"" Dream Ballet).  Musical direction by Alfred Newman is also very fine (the Main Title music alone is worth the price of admission).  The film also made history at the time, for featuring the most expensive in-studio set, and starring an all-Asian cast.  This was the only Rodgers and Hammerstein movie musical made by Universal Studios, under the auspices of producer Ross Hunter.

Although FLOWER DRUM SONG has been cruelly dismissed throughout the ensuing years for it's un-PC attitudes and ideas, the musical itself is an endlessly enjoyable ride for the entire family.  The DVD has been a long time coming, and now fans can complete their Rodgers and Hammerstein DVD collections with this rarest of jewels...FLOWER DRUM SONG.",1153958400,157,2918,5.085953878406708

218037,5,6300184242,"Back in the 60's with Mao's anti-American Imperialism raging and America's anti-Communist fervour globalised, it wasn't easy watching Flower Drum Song (FDS) especially by pacifist overseas Chinese without cognitive dissonance.

In the air, there was a dichotomy in loyalty - whether to march with the self-determinism of Chinese pride paraded by Mao or to sway with the so-called Westernised Chinese social-economic model a la Taiwan. There was no grey mouse; one had to be either a black cat or a white one. In this era, there was also no home screening of movies a la VCR, VCD or DVD. Cinemas were kings. What we saw and what we got on the silver screen really burned into our impressionable memories and FDS was one of these unforgotten genres. It was revolutionary; a movie with overriding Chinese theme made in Hollywood albeit trying to show that the American way of life could also accommodate traditional Chinese life-style if everyone believed in co-existence pax Americana. It all seemed utopian then for realpolitik was cast in Kiplingian: OH, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet. We chased the dragon in our heads and dreamt a surrealistic haze with the melodies of FDS humming in our heads under the threat of nuclear conflagration.

Now, with the opening up of Mainland China and the issue of Taiwan less irreconcilable with their two capitalistic economies in balance, we can enjoy FDS without any tint of regrets or cognitive dissonance.",1140307200,6,1480,4.963709677419355

Wealthy and very old-fashioned Master Wang Chi-Yang (Benson Fong) lives in San Francisco with his two sons, Ta (James Shigeta), who's just about to graduate college, and San (Patrick Adiarte), about 15, plus his late wife's sister, Mme. Liang (Juanita Hall).  San is 100% Americanized, Ta describes himself as half-and-half, and Mme. Liang seems happy to take the best from both cultures.  To the family's door comes Samuel Adams ""Sammy"" Fong (Jack Soo), manager of the Celestial Garden night club, who has a delicate problem: Mei Li (Miyoshi Umeki), the picture bride arranged for by his mother (Soo Yong), has arrived from Mainland China much sooner than he had expected, complete with her father (Kam Tong), formerly of the faculty of the University of Peking.  But Sammy already has a girl, Linda Low (Nancy Kwan), the star of his floor show--they've been an item for five years--and he really doesn't want an old-country bride.  He knows that Master Wang, while quite willing to finance Ta's education almost unto infinity, wants to see the young man married, so he suggests that the Wangs take over the contract for Mei Li--and get her securely wed to Ta before Mme. Fong finds out she's in the country.  (""Dad left her the business, if I cross her she'll cut me off without a fried noodle!"" he later explains to Linda.)  Meanwhile, Linda, weary of waiting for a wedding ring, has met Ta on a blind date and decided to maneuver *him* into marriage.  And Helen Chao (Reiko Sato), a struggling seamstress, pines for Ta, whom she's secretly loved for years, while he barely knows she's alive.  At Mme. Liang's insistence, Master Wang agrees to give Ta and Mei Li one week to fall in love ""naturally, American style,"" and the film follows the ensuing confusions and heartbreak to a triumphant and happy climax engineered by the clever Mei Li.

Given its early-1960's date, not to mention the original source (C. Y. Lee's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flower-Drum-Song/dp/1559362227/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flower Drum Song</a>), the book is naturally rather more chauvinistic than modern audiences might be comfortable with--all the women, except perhaps the older widows Mme. Liang and Mme. Fong, seem to want nothing but to be married; but it has a great intrinsic charm and lots of great R&H music (including Umeki's sweet rendition of ""A Hundred Million Miracles,"" which, in a way, sets the tone for the entire movie, Kwan's brassy ""Grant Avenue,"" the ensemble's ""Chop Suey,"" and Sato's yearning ""Love, Look Away""), as well as several good dance numbers.  (It's also notable that the DVD seems to be able to handle the loud Chinese reds of the sets and costumes better than the VHS version did!)  Chinese culture is treated with respect, if somewhat humorously (as we might expect in a musical), and Master Wang even gets the chance to maintain at least some of his traditional style.  Though purists might object to the casting of so many Japanese actors in Chinese roles (to say nothing of Hall, who was neither), they seem to be able to handle the task convincingly, and although the exterior street sets are very obviously soundstage copies, they occur so seldom that you can ignore the jar.  At over two hours it's a bit longer than most modern films, but not excessively so.  A fine adaptation of the successful stage show (Hall, Adiarte, and Umeki recreate their original roles, while Soo is promoted from his part as the Celestial Gardens MC), with much to recommend it.",1138838400,2,3875,5.2882736156351795

Song ""A Hundred Million Miracles"" in the park is sweet - and funny situation with the Cop being unable to read Chinese and having to get help from the crowd.

Linda Low is very A-typical Chinese Girl (according to the stereotype of the time) and changes her focus from long-time love, Sammy Fong, to Ta when Sammy won't produce a ring!

Dance scene at Graduation party is good!  Lots of great dancers - thought some of the curly hairstyles (typical of late 50's early 60's for non-Asians) were a little out-of-place...but only a minor detail.

Ta's father is typical ""Old Chinese"" and his coughing spells to get his way are hilarious!

Mei Li's watching TV to learn English is cute (actually reminds me of ""Splash"") and her innocence is believable!

Childrens' dancing in courtyard is great, but sure wish it wasn't so much just panning the kids and would show more scenery - DVD Widescreen Edition, PLEASE!!!

Let's pop the corn and watch together!  A GREAT movie to watch with the family!

218041,4,6300184242,"Watch this when....you are nostalgic for a bright, happy blast from the past.  This is a great old movie (1961); it's got a score by Rodgers and Hammerstein, it's set in late 1950s Chinatown in San Francisco, and it's fun to watch.  It's an adaptation of hit Broadway musical comedy.  The colors and costumes are wonderful; the songs and choreography are very well done and highly entertaining.  It's the story of a traditional Chinese girl who has, along with her father, entered the country illegally, for an arranged marriage to the son of a San Francisco family.  The problem: the parents have made the marriage arrangements, and the son who is supposed to be the happy and dutiful groom is a thoroughly Americanized nightclub owner with a thing for one of his dancers.  He doesn't want to alienate his family, but he's got a life and plans of his own.  How do you keep everybody happy when generations and lifestyles collide?

The cool thing about this movie is that it went against the late 50s stereotypes by portraying Chinese characters as groovy swingers.  And the cast was nearly all-Asian; remarkable for that era.  Don't look for cultural authenticity here: many of the actors are actually Japanese not Chinese; there is such a thing as a flower drum, but it's not used in the manner portrayed in the movie, and when it comes right down to it, a lot of the elements of this movie are kind of hokey.  But you know what?  I love this movie, it's bright, it's cheesy, it's simplistic, it's a no-brainer, it's fun fun fun ~ it's an Elvis movie with chop suey!!

218046,5,6300184242,"Based on a novel by C.Y. Lee, FLOWER DRUM SONG was a hit show by Rogers and Hammerstein on Broadway in 1958. It was adapted for the screen by Joseph Fields and Oscar Hammerstein with Ross Hunter as producer and Henry Koster as director. The movie featured a mostly Asian cast with the notable exception of the very talented Juanita Hall who was famous for her role as Bloody Mary in SOUTH PACIFIC.
The young Asian performers are Nancy Kwan, Myoshi Umeki, James Shigeta and Jack Soo. Because of the venerable Chinese custom of arranged marriages, it appears that Nancy Kwan, a nightclub dancer, may marry the youthful James Shigeta while the innocent Myoshi Umeki will end up in the arms of Jack Soo, a worldly nightclub owner. Can this tragedy possibly be avoided and everybody discover their own true loves? We finally learn the answer to this question about 133 minutes later.
Don't miss Benson Fong who will be remembered as Tommy Chan in a few of the Charlie Chan films of the 1940's such as THE SHANGHAI COBRA. He appears here as James Shigeta's father.
FLOWER DRUM SONG was overshadowed by WEST SIDE STORY in 1961 but it did still manage to receive Oscar nominations for Best Color Cinematography, Color Costume Design, Color Art Direction, Scoring of a Musical Picture and Sound.",1047686400,49,1286,4.745535714285714

I've never fallen out of love with it, though the enthusiasm I've always had for the show has succumbed to seemingly unassailable charges that the show was cute, patronizing and politically incorrect.
I'm so happy that a recent Broadway revival has allegedly returned to the original novel as the source for its wholely revised libretto.  I'm especially delighted that the film (which faithfully adapted the Broadway show) is at last out of the shadows and appreciated for the abundance of riches that it WAS.  For far too long it has resided unfairly in shame for what it was not.

Usually it played in NY on a Sunday afternoon, so I saw it at my grandmother's and darn, we always had to leave before it was over! But with the magic of VCRs and DVDs, such disappointments are a thing of the past. Now you and I can enjoy this bouncy musical whenever we want.
""Flower Drum Song"" is Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1960's musical, set in San Francisco's Chinatown with an all-Asian cast (except maybe Juanita Hall, I""m not really sure what she was). A young girl and her father have stowed away on a ship so that she can fulfill her destiny as a ""picture bride"" to nightclub owner Jack Soo. Soo's mother had placed the order, not him--this Rat Pack guy is much more interested in his showgirl girlfriend Linda, played by Nancy Kwan. Yet, Nancy tells us that her ring finger feels mighty cold, so she indulges in a fling with College Man James Shigeta. He'd be much better off with the illegal immigrant, but because he's at odds with his own old-world father who prefers her to the showgirl, stubbornly refuses to consider the match. A little like ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" where mismatched couples are running in the wrong directions. But there's a beautiful seamstress in the wings who longs for the College Man too, and sings the ballad, ""Love, Look Away"" to emphasize her feelings for the man she can't snatch away from either woman. Other great songs include Kwan's exuberant ""I Enjoy Being a Girl""; Shigeta's realization of love for the picture bride, ""You are Beautiful""; a few great dance numbers like ""Grand Avenue, San Francisco"", ""The Other Generation"" and ""Chop Suey""; and the main number, ""A Hundred Million Miracles"", which is what the characters will need to sort out their romantic problems.
One reason why I get such a kick out of ""FDS"" is that it is a perfect time capsule of the Kennedy Era. I love the women's costumes, which look just like the photos of my mom and sisters at the World's Fair. Some reviewers have criticized the movie for being dated, but that's WHY I love it--it's as much a period piece as ""It Happened One Night"" for the 1930s or ""Mildred Pierce"" for the 1940s. I'm glad too that they used an all-Asian cast for the movie, unlike the Broadway play. Unlike ""Carousel"" or ""South Pacific"", there are no serious overtones to this movie--it's all bounce and go, and let me tell you, with such a great dance ensemble, there's plenty of bounce! Lots of talent showcased here.
If you've yet to sample this great dim sum of a movie, pick out a copy of ""Flower Drum Song"" tonight and prepare for a delightful time.",1032134400,13,2621,4.56687898089172
