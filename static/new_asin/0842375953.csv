7793074,3,0842375953,This video was great for what it was as I previewed it before my son saw it. I Thought it was okay but decided it was much too juvenile for my son who is about to turn eight years old. It seemed to teach everything through song and dance which might keep younger kids and preschoolers' attention span going. I would probably recommend this video to people that had very young children for an introduction to the Commandments. This video I think would be a little juvenile for older kids 5 and older.,1380758400,,499,4.376344086021505
7793075,5,0842375953,"This is an incredible movie.  It is a kid friendly biblical perspective on the first and second commandments.  It is placed in story form so the kids can understand, yet stays completely biblical.  It is told from the perspective of a young boy.  It includes Moses receiving the 10 commandments and then teaching them to the people.  5 star rating!!!!",1237939200,,351,4.783333333333333
