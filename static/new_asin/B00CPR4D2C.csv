8584648,2,B00CPR4D2C,"I bought this to show to my high school Spanish class. The first thing I noticed was that Colombia was spelled with a u -Columbia, on the cover. When I put it in the DVD player, it kept skipping. We put it in another DVD player, but the problem continued. This was so distracting that we had to stop watching it altogether. Both DVD players function just fine with other DVDs. I watched it on my PC and had no problems though. Towards the end, Brazil is shown. At one point there is a topless woman dancing directly in front of the camera. Also, the narrator adds some fairly abrasive comments about two of the countries. He suggests that Colombia needs to get its act together so that its people can be proud, rather than embarrassed of their homeland. It also focused on a lot of birds. Sometimes, it was sort of weird because he'd be talking about three different birds, but only show one of them. It's not a bad video, but for $20, I was super disappointed. The main reason that I had been willing to pay $20 was that it said it was released in February of 2014. I thought that the images would be very up to date (I'd wanted my high schoolers see Latin American culture as it is now rather than probably just before they were born). This was not the case at all. The clothing was very out dated. I might as well have dug out a VHS from our storage closet.",1397001600,,1360,4.254826254826255
