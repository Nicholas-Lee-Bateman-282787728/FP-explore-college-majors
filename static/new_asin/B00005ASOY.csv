1417968,5,B00005ASOY,"Probably my favorite cartoon ever, and the first real emergence of cartoon horror I can remember. The Inhumanoids themselves, imprisoned in the bowels of the earth, were stark, Lovecraftian monstrosities both in their ancient appetites and titan proportions. D' Compose was a rotten, gangling zombie with the ability to spread undeath by touch. Tendril was a crawling, devouring horror with the tentacled maw of Cthulhu. Metlar was the alpha male demon, hellish king of his elder minions. There was a sense of smallness and desperation to the humans that confronted the monsters, though they were aided by a rival race, again Lovecraftian, that strove to return the Inhumanoids to their prison. Later, we saw even darker twists of the story, such as the arrival of Nightcrawler, undead spawn of D' Compose, or even the emergence of another Inhumanoid, a gelatinous cyclops with an appetite for anything and everything. There's no telling where the show might have gone, if it had continued. But, I guess in those days the show was just squeezing past the censors, so as much as it irritated me it didn't really surprise me when the show got canned. The great ones are all usually cut off in their prime. Nothing makes me happier than to see the show now resurrected, as if by the twisted claw of D' Compose himself. The fact that the Inhumanoids have returned via DVD is better still. Two Big thumbs up to the show, and two thumbs up to the boys at Rhino too.",997833600,16,1459,4.770750988142293
1417969,5,B00005ASOY,"This is one of the few cartoons I watched in my youth that still has any sort of value today. Others like He-Man, Thundercats (I am so ashamed I watched that, snarf, snarf), and Silverhawks are pure kiddy fair. Truly, Inhumanoids was meant for more mature audiences. Scenes of death, destruction, and monster cannibalism made up the roughly dozen episodes made. I recorded a large majority of them back in 1986, but I am still glad that Rhino has decided to issue Inhumanoids on DVD. After all, the VHS is starting too look kinda bad, except for all those killer 80s toy commercials!!!",986774400,4,585,4.689320388349515
1417970,5,B00005ASOY,"This series was absolutely amazing. It had a strong story and fresh characters...some quite frightening. It is the story of creatures that have lived on the earth long before the time of man. Through mankinds folly, we unleash some of the worst of them on the earth. Their first move is, of course, to take back what is theirs...  It is a fun series, with mutants, heroes, villains, walking dead, tree and stone folk...  Check it out if you can. I have been hunting for the last 8 to 10 years for these cartoons and here they are...ON DVD!!!!!!",986256000,5,544,4.484848484848484
1417971,4,B00005ASOY,"For anyone who is a fan of the animation of the 80's, like G.I. Joe or The Transformers, this is a must have. Its been years since this movie has been avliable on VHS and I couldn't e more excited about this re-release.  The story centers on a classic good-vs-evil  motif, but its lively and creative characters make it really interesting. First the is the heroic human group 'Earth Corps', who inadvertantly free and subsequently are inlisted to help recapture the inhumanoids; a subterranean group of titanic monsters. The demon-like trio of Inhumanoids includes Decompose; a skeletal beast, Tedril; a plant creature, and Metlar; a metal-scaled monster whose volcanic core is filled with molten lava!!! In this exciting adventure the Earth Corps must face the danger of the Inhumanoids and survive an encounter with the mysterious Mutores, another subterranean group of creatures who might be either friends, or foes. So for fans of colorful animation of the 80's, look no further.",984096000,4,983,5.099378881987578

7935688,5,B00005ASOY,"one of the most underrated cartoon series of the 80's. its gross man, i am surprised they let this stuff get to tv for kids in the 80's. and by gross i mean totally awesome. the toys were amazing too, this needed a season 2!",1403740800,,224,4.0
7935689,3,B00005ASOY,"The cartoon is a fun and interesting idea that was ahead of its time wrapped in a low budge poorly handled package.

The voice acting make my laugh, the animation is fair at its best to jerky and bad looking and the story line has several obvious holes in it.

However,

The monsters frightening to imagine and pretty unstoppable and treated that way all the way till the end.",1245542400,,376,4.420289855072464
7935690,2,B00005ASOY,I almost regret wating my money on this.  I can see it's nothing more than a product seller trying to sell their product.  I don't even think this is on TV anymore.,1235952000,,164,4.09375
7935691,2,B00005ASOY,"HEY,HOW'S IT GOING? This series was pretty good for it's time. Action meets Horror with monsters and all. The quality of this show is pretty decent, although I wished they could bring this out in a COMPLETE SERIES DVDBoxset form, (maybe REMASTERED DVDSET?)reason being this only has the first 5Epsds, the origins of the four characters and how they stumbled upon this race of wood creatures(amongst others)that have been battling these monsters and IMPRISONED THEM, since before the human race. It's still good to watch though, but there are no extras or special features  whatsoever,it's only the FIVE episodes and THAT'S IT. Which is WHY? I'm only giving it 2STARS. Gotta say though the animation IS STILL PRETTY COOL!",1232928000,,720,5.050420168067227
7935692,4,B00005ASOY,"This wasn't one of the best 80's toy-related cartoons, mainly because the toys weren't that good and the show was weird. From what I remember, a team of 3 guys had adventures in the earth's core fighting monsters. They had these huge armored suits that they had to put on in order to go there, of course. I think one guy's suit had big claws on it, another had drills... things you'd need in order to get around in the core of the earth.",1127520000,,437,4.214285714285714
7935693,5,B00005ASOY,"This DVD and the other USA Volume only has the first 8 episodes and was released years ago which means the other 5 are not so likely to make it. But In the UK they have released all 13 episodes as a two disc set in one box.
You can order it off the UK Amazon because I am in the UK and order lots off the USA Amazon with my same account details which are recognised in all Amazon sites. BELOW IS THE LINK TO IT

(...)
Just so you know NTSC AND PAL are not really our worry anymore with foreign DVDS because I once had a region 2 only DVD player but still played NTSC DVDS at region zero which is because as of today nearly all USA TVS and DVD Machines for the past 5 years have pal playback, same with UK TVS and DVD Machines having NTSC playback, which is why as long as your TV is less than 5 years old, to play this and all other UK Region 2 DVDS in the USA all you need is a Region free or Multi Region DVD Player.",1121126400,9,918,3.78125
7935694,5,B00005ASOY,"After making Inhumanoids-Evil That Lies Within the last part of my 80s toons shopping spree (I already picked up Thundercats, She-Ra, Inspector Gadget, Rainbow Brite, Gi Joe, Transformers, etc) I feel that I have had a successful week in reliving my childhood.  Viewing this old toon had me wondering the entire time: ""Damn, they actually showed some of this stuff when I was growing up?""  I only say that because I know some of the scenes with Decompose would never be aired on Children's programming today.  Rhino actually did a decent job with this DVD by actually including the first few episodes of the series.  If you're a fan of the show from yester'year, then you should definitely check this one out.",1113696000,6,709,4.786885245901639
7935695,2,B00005ASOY,"Taking another voyage back to the womb, I decided to check out one of the more memorable 'toon series of my youth, 'The InHumanoids'. I recall a few kinda graphic scenes from some later eppies (sadly, none of which appears in this DVD) that burned this show into my memories of those 80s kidvid glory days. And after viewing 'InHumanoids' again for the first time in over a decade, I came to the realization that I was easily entertained as a kid, 'cause the years that've gone by haven't been too kind to this series. The storyline's pace is too fast and somewhat disjointed- there were some places that need a link or bridge, but instead just cuts right to the next thing. Alla sudden, the heroes are in one place, then another, then split up, with only some passing banter explaining what's going down. You've got all of these things going on, but there's really not enough time to explain it all in the five shows that make it up. Of course, when you're ten years old, it's not like you care too much about the story-- you're just killin' the time between 'Yogi Bear & Pals' and whatever other horrid Hanna-Barbera monstrosity awaits after this show is over with!
And let's not forget a running list of those infamous cartoon cliches that pop up, such as corny back-and-forth banter between the heroes, the 'G.I. Joe' method of not killing pilots by havin' them parachute out right before the aircraft explodes, and other silliness. Throw in the less-than-subtle hint (to the 'rents, anyway) that the show is yet another glorified toy ad (this was produced by the guys who put out 'G.I. Joe' & 'Transformers', after all), and you've got your basic 80s action-adventure 'toon show. I only wish the animation quality was as good as those other two series. Put the all-too-quick pace and the less-than-stellar moving cels together, and you've got one of 'toondom's most pathetic rush-jobs!
Still, even with all of its ridiculous moments and lapses in quality, 'InHumanoids' does have a certain degree of that lovable cartoon cheesiness to it. Not nearly to the extent of its far-more-popular Hasbro-manufactured brethren, mind you. But hey, you can't have everything! And it'll always remain a sentimental bit of nostalgia from my youth, no matter how hard I try to forget!

7935696,4,B00005ASOY,"This DVD is good enough I guess, it is the first 5 episodes as they were first broadcast with all the recaps and all that. One thing that bugged me right from the start(litterally) was that the intro was changed. The ""Inhumanoids"" track was much too loud and dominating, the background music was almost inaudible & there was another voice track missing entirely, I just played my copy of the movie to compare. The quality of the picture and sound is probably the best you could expect and there probably isn't a better source. The packaging: Myself I would have preferred some of the original artwork used to promote Inhumanoids rather than the new artwork on the cover. Also one last note on the content of the disc, I've only seen the abridged version before so I never knew how much it goes back on itself, you will get to a break then when it comes back from the brack they pretty much re-enact the last minute or more of action, with different animation and sound, strange.(It's as if they didn't have enough story to stretch over 5 episodes) A note on the title on here, I don't know why they call is Parts 1 & 2 as it's parts 1-5 and the other DVD is the first 4 episodes of the series that came after this mini series, then there is just 4 episodes left after that so the thought of them releasing the whole series (These 5 & 8 More Episodes) is not an unlikely one.",1002931200,4,1374,4.329457364341085
