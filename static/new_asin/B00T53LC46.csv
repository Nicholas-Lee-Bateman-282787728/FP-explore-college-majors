8700294,4,B00T53LC46,"This low-budget video movie that was filmed on VHS in the 80s is very entertaining. It was unavailable for a time here at Amazon, so I thought it went out of print and quickly bought it elsewhere. However, it now appears to be available again at the time I'm doing this review. The story involves a child who rents a book at the library. He then brings it home and begins to read it, so we are shown a film crew that's filming a horror movie in the woods who later encounters some other real horrors. The one thing that I didn't like about this flick is the injection of some unnecessary humor. When the kid begins to read the book, the voice of the narrator begins to speak and tells the kid he's the narrator when he wants to know who's speaking. It then starts to get silly with some other scenes in parts that should've been cut for a more serious toned horror movie. It does get serious at times and this is the way the entire thing should've been. Now, aside from the humor, I thought the rest of it was well done. Despite being filmed on VHS and cheap, it has some really good aerial shots in the beginning during the credits. The woodland locations are also nice. There's no nudity in the movie, but it does have some good low-budget gore. However, most of the good stuff is towards the ending parts. This is when I thought the thing got cool and fun with the gore and creatures in the forest. It also has a cool ending when it shows what happens to the kid who's reading the book. The acting throughout the entire thing is about what you'd expect from a cheap video flick like this, but I've seen worse. As for the directing, I thought it was actually good. Overall, as long as you can tolerate some of its humor and that it may seem slow in some spots to some people because it doesn't have violence and gore throughout, it's a good example on how to make a well done horror on VHS with a limited budget. If you're looking for a more exploitive VHS movie from the 80s that has violence and gore throughout the picture, as well as sex and nudity, I wouldn't recommend it.

The quality on the DVD is good. The VHS master that they used is in good shape.",1460419200,,2161,4.245145631067961
8700295,1,B00T53LC46,"This is an extreme low budget film from 1986. It is a spoof of low budget ""B"" movie films and attempt to make itself a camp cult classic with bad photography, acting, dialogue and props. In an attempt to be ""so bad it is good"" it has achieved the dismal ""so bad it is bad.""

There was really nothing in the film that invokes horror or laughter, just groans, and not the good kind.

A boy takes a book out in the Atlanta library and reads a story about making a ""B"" movie while there is a real evil in the woods.

No swearing sex or nudity. No real reason to watch the film.",1451433600,2,573,4.008771929824562

8700297,4,B00T53LC46,"Evil in the Woods is all over the place.  The plot says it all.  A yokel narrator is telling a tale about a film crew making a monster movie in the woods when real monsters show up to cause havoc.  A kid reading this story unfold in a book pops up every once in awhile, taking us out of the movie, to break up the story.  I love this movie, and I hate this movie.

The narrative structure can't hold a single thought long enough without being frentic and all over the place.  Then again, the movie's got that '80's vintage charm (it really does).  The idea is very fun.  The ending delivers some gory goods and fun.  You just have to tolerate being jerked around, narratively, to enjoy the experience.  You have to put in a little work to enjoy it, but it does add up to something in the end.

Would've loved commentary on this DVD, but you do what you can do.

Memorable, but it is hard to watch in places.",1432166400,6,907,4.149425287356322
