2361454,5,B000A5N4GM,"My kids just love this DVD.  They enjoy doing the yoga.  The moves are easy for them to follow along, yet enough variety that it keeps their interest.  Wonderful DVD for kids!",1121817600,27,175,4.40625
2361506,3,B000A5N4GM,"My 2.5 year old LOVES the YogaKids video...the music, lots of different kids and poses, filmed outside.  This video is more like taking a yoga class, with the teacher talking the entire time, which I think detracts from the yoga experience.  If you're looking for another yoga video to add to your collection for some variety, this may be it.  But if you only get one, go for the Yoga Kids, it's much better.",1183852800,7,408,4.486486486486487
2361507,5,B000A5N4GM,"I am a Health and Physical Education teacher at an elementary school.  During the state testing week I do yoga with my Prek - [...]

I wasn't impressed when I previewed the video.  I decided to show it to my students anyway.  Of the three videos I showed them this was their favorite because it kept them moving.

I felt that the quality of the video was not as good as Marsha Wenig's Yoga Kids Videos.  But, like I said the students liked this one the most.",1174521600,12,458,4.206896551724138
2361508,1,B000A5N4GM,"Bought this for my active three year old who is enrolled in dance, gymnastics and swim class thinking that she would enjoy doing this at home.  Well it kept her attention for maybe five minutes.  The sound quality is poor.  It sounds like it was filmed in a basement, which it probably was.  I would not recommend this to any one and should have saved my money.",1168473600,18,361,4.343283582089552
2361509,5,B000A5N4GM,"I bought this as a gift for my cousin's son (age 6) and he loves it!  His mom and baby sister (age 2 next month)enjoys it too and they frequently do the yoga practice as a family; including her 4 year old neice who she baby sits.  The yoga is simple to follow and presented in a fun way for the children.  A nice introduction.

If you are interested in presenting yoga to your children also be sure to check out the book:  My Daddy Is A Pretzel by Baron Baptiste (his yoga videos for adults are great too) and Sophie Fatus",1167868800,5,522,4.078431372549019
2361510,5,B000A5N4GM,"This DVD is excellent.  I teach elementary physical education, and have found it most appropriate for kids in grades K-3.",1166227200,16,121,5.05
2361511,4,B000A5N4GM,"My kids really like this yoga DVD.  Although they have yet to actually do the whole thing, they enjoy it.  I like the way it's done, really geared towards children to make it fun, but they are definitely learning yoga.  I also like the instructor, she's clear, adds elements children enjoy and best of all, isn't talking ""baby talk"".  I would definitely recommend this DVD for any young children interested in yoga.  By the way, my husband liked doing it too!",1160092800,10,459,4.617283950617284
2361512,5,B000A5N4GM,"My kids (5yr & 9yr) really enjoyed this video. I have actually done it with them a few times, and I have enjoyed it too!

Instructor is calm & soothing, and gives slow and easy instructions.  Simple and FUN !!!",1152835200,18,210,4.225
2361513,5,B000A5N4GM,I bought this video so that my 3 year old & I could do a relaxing activity together while my 1 year old napped.  I love Nancy Wile!  She has a soothing voice and does poses that are not too hard and does not change poses too fast.  My 3 year old joins in every now and then and I am hoping he will try more as he gets older.  I would highly recommend this video!!,1151366400,12,363,3.736842105263158
2361514,5,B000A5N4GM,Both my child and I enjoyed this program. It is easy to follow and has both simple and complex poses. Both young and old children will enjoy it.,1143244800,16,144,4.178571428571429
2361515,5,B000A5N4GM,my son (6) was very interested in trying this one - very good for kids,1142812800,11,70,3.7333333333333334
8074653,5,B000A5N4GM,My kids have been doing this for years now and they still enjoy it.,1505692800,,67,3.857142857142857
8074654,1,B000A5N4GM,"Boring, annoying voice, hard to follow, boring instructor",1460937600,,57,6.25
8074655,1,B000A5N4GM,Very poor quality.  My kids never liked this dvd and it ended up in the donation box.,1452902400,,85,4.0
8074656,3,B000A5N4GM,My kids love to do yoga; the quality of the video and sound wasn't great but a fun video nevertheless.,1239321600,,102,4.15
8074657,3,B000A5N4GM,"My elementary P.E students enjoyed this video during our fitness unit. I however, thought it was low budget. The sound quality was not good, the instructor talks to the children in the video but you can not hear their reply.",1229299200,2,224,4.625
8074658,2,B000A5N4GM,"It was just ok.  It wasn't incredibly engaging for my three children (ages 5, 5, & 7).  I don't know what I expected, but it just seemed a little amateur in production quality and the teacher wasn't particularly motivating.",1197331200,,223,4.6923076923076925
8074659,5,B000A5N4GM,I am a kindergarten teacher and  I do these poses with my class.  They do love them plus it is a good healthy workout for them--and me!,1191628800,2,135,3.962962962962963
8074660,5,B000A5N4GM,I bought this DVD for my 4.5 yr daughter and she really loves it. I like the approach the teacher has taken to do the yoga for kids and with the kids. It makes the kids more involved when they see the right form (by watching teacher)and not neccessarily able to do all the pose (by watching kids in the DVD). My daughter loves to practice yoga regularly. I am happy to get the good and useful reviews from amazon.,1185753600,3,413,4.175
8074661,1,B000A5N4GM,"Award winning? Surely they're joking!
My children pay more attention to my regular program and have more fun with it than they do with this kid's program. The lighting is awful, the woman is not confident, it's not anywhere near as creative as I would have hoped, the children in the DVD are very distracting because they don't follow directions, and it DEFINITELY was not worth the money I paid for it.
You'd be better off buying something else!",1184025600,4,446,4.658227848101266
