2344449,5,B000A0C71K,I found the video to be more helpful than the product printed manual.  Finding things in the manual is a task.  The video is easy to understand and covers the points I could not easily find in the printed document.,1168473600,3,214,4.325
2344450,1,B000A0C71K,"I was very disappointed when I watched this DVD.

This DVD does a great job at telling you what features the D50 has, but it does a horrible job on how to use these features.",1167436800,,174,3.9714285714285715
2344451,5,B000A0C71K,"This DVD makes learning, or just brushing up on your skills simple and easy.",1155513600,6,76,4.5
2344452,5,B000A0C71K,"This DVD will get using your D50 with confidence.  Sure ""almost"" everything could be mined out of manual.  But that thing is as dry as it gets.",1144540800,19,143,4.2592592592592595
2344453,5,B000A0C71K,"I Liked The DVD It Had All The Information I Was Looking For

There's A Lot To The Camera I Like Seeing On A DVD Instead Of

Reading The Owner's Manual.",1142467200,,152,3.870967741935484

8070945,4,B000A0C71K,"I bought my D50 years ago and this has so helped to discover
areas I didn't even know existed.  It can get technical at times but
that covers those who are deep into photography.  Being just a \
picture taker, I am not in that group but this book works for me
beautifulllly",1391644800,,273,4.132075471698113
8070946,1,B000A0C71K,"You'll get more out of just reading the manual. This doesn't tell you how to use the camera settings to take great photos, it just tells you how to change some of the settings (and not all).",1359676800,,190,4.162162162162162
8070947,5,B000A0C71K,"Very informational DVD.  Covers the whole camera usage. From the easiest to the hardest features.
I would recommend this learning material.",1357171200,,139,5.619047619047619
8070948,5,B000A0C71K,"Purchased the,ASIN # B000A0C71K Introductionto Nikon D50 SLR camera. Instructor on the DVD went fast. Had to go back to review to often. The seller was very good to respond with a refund. I would purchased from this seller again.",1322870400,,229,4.75
8070949,5,B000A0C71K,"A couple of years ago I bought the D50 for my wife, who loved taking pictures. She only used the Auto mode, verbalizing how she loved the pictures she got but wished she could learn to use the advanced settings and was frustrated and overwhelmed when she opened the manual each time.
  Getting her this DVD and having her watch it was like opening a door into the sunshine for her. It is very clearly explained by a teacher the most basic to advanced settings in a very professional and intuitive manner to start giving the novice the confidence to advance themselves from a neophyte to one who can start to understand what they want to capture before they push the shutter button and control the camera to do it.
  As a classroom teacher myself for 38 years, and loving photography, I can easily recommend this particular DVD to anyone who wants to get the most out of their D50. I would no doubt have confidence that the other videos from Blue Crane probably hit the mark for the particular camera they are instructing as well from watching this one. Good teaching is still hard to find, but this lesson is worth a lot more than the small sum being asked.",1245888000,,1157,4.469194312796208
8070950,4,B000A0C71K,"I haven,t finished this dvd yet ,but so far it is very helpful and enjoyable  to watch and rewind. The narrator has a good voice for explaining the d50. This dvd would be a plus for you to have in your library. TR",1243814400,,213,3.953488372093023
8070951,5,B000A0C71K,"Don't waste your time downloading a factory manual online.(Or worse,buying one) This DVD will give you everything you need and get you going much faster than any of the books ever will.",1207008000,,185,4.8125
8070952,4,B000A0C71K,"... but I can't because ultimately the information doesn't go much past the manual.  That said, though, the information presented is clear and well organized which makes it more useful as a teaching too than the printed manual.  I found some of the advice very useful - it was in the manual, but somewhat buried.  If you can learn to use products from a reference volume, you won't need this guide, but if you learn better from a visual presentation (along with trying things out with the camera) this video is worth the money.",1174867200,3,527,4.585106382978723
