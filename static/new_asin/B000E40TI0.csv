2489137,4,B000E40TI0,"I'm a professional sports photographer, and often get asked for tips and advice about how to shoot sports images, so I thought I would pick up this DVD to see if it would be worth recommending to folks. Well, it surprised me - it's not half bad. Sure, there's only so much that be covered in this short amount of time, but they do a good job of covering the basics, and if someone watches this disc a couple times, their photos should improve noticeably.

He only covers baseball and football in depth, but the tips for these two sports can be used for almost any outdoor sporting event. The author goes to great lengths to emphasize that the shots shown therein are NOT taken with pro-level gear, but I would have liked a little something in there showing ""what's next"" for shooters who might wonder what an increase in equipment capability might bring.

This is a pretty good overview, and I'd not hesitate suggesting new shooters view this DVD. Watch it, then watch it again.",1183334400,7,978,4.551136363636363
2489138,5,B000E40TI0,"I have been trying to figure out kid's sports photography for 6 mos. on my own, mostly by reading internet forums.  I learned more in 70 minutes with this video than the entire aggregate of time spent on the internet (and my own trial and error).

I had long ago given up trying to figure out manual settings for aperture and shutter speed.  His instruction on this is the best part of the video.  He provides a simple explanation for how to shoot in aperture priority mode, and how to easily balance aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.

If you are a parent with a dslr, taking photos of kids' sports, this video is a must.",1171670400,4,621,4.3652173913043475
2489139,5,B000E40TI0,"I've just begun taking sports photos with a digital SLR camera, an Olympus E-500. I've done all sorts of experimenting with ISO, white balance, shutter and aperture settings, sometimes with good results, but generally inconsistent.

The specific, helpful hints given in this video are most helpful. I like the detailed, but not overly technical explanations of ISO, aperture, and shutter speeds. And the short bits at the end, discussing how to photograph specific sports from football to cheerleading to basketball, are ideally aimed at individual needs. More experienced photographers may find little to help them, but for beginners like me, this is a very valuable DVD!",1167609600,8,672,5.339622641509434
2489140,5,B000E40TI0,This video gives straight forward and useful information on shooting digital photography in various sports settings.  I found it very useful.,1154995200,6,141,5.714285714285714
2489141,5,B000E40TI0,I have many books about digital sports photography and they don't even come close to this DVD in regard to practical application.  The title of this DVD is so on target.  It is 'simple' to use the settings suggested and it pays off immediately.  This is an excellent DVD and well worth the cost.  (I wish the same people made one about digital portrait photography.)  To ALL Parents of Athletes: BUY THIS DVD. Only buy the books if you want to go into professional sports photography.,1154563200,6,484,4.5813953488372094
2489142,5,B000E40TI0,"Teaching photography I have seen quite a few how-to videos, and this one is the best so far. It is well thought-out and produced. It takes the view point of an amateur photographer (Mom and/or Dad photographing the kids playing various sports), but has many concepts that could just as easily apply to professionals. Equipment wise he does expect a digital SLR with a minimum of a 200mm lens. Sorry no point-and-shoots allowed. Otherwise I would highly recommend this video!",1152057600,6,474,4.9375
2489143,5,B000E40TI0,"I'm new to using an SLR and this DVD was the perfect training video.  This video tells you what equipment you need, how to set it up, where to position yourself, and how to shoot for the best results.  With my new camera and this information, I immediately was able to produce good shots during basketball and baseball games.

Well worth the money.",1141948800,6,348,4.492063492063492
2489144,5,B000E40TI0,"Of all the instruction and training I've received over the years, I thought this was one of the best, if not the best, instructional DVDs I've ever seen. Doug Jensen has really set the bar. Every aspect of it was extremely well done - scripting, structure, use of stills and video, video camera work (I'm a video producer myself, so I paid particular attention to that) audio (often a weak point in DVDs) and the use of graphics (I really liked the 'through the viewfinder' parts - where sports action video is shown framed in a SLR viewfinder) - even the glossary was helpful in reviewing terms and also the explanation of the digital photo histogram. Plus, it was loaded with tons of practical tips and advice - the kind of things that a really experienced photographer tells you one-on-one, when they want to help you out. For someone like me who is transitioning from a film 35mm SLR to digital SLR - it was really helpful to clarify the concept of EV (Exposure Value) and the interplay of ISO, shutter and aperture. Yeah, I knew what they were - but to see the relationship ""in action"" and how it changes from shutter priority to aperture priority (depending on the shot) really reinforced the concepts. If you buy only one resource for digital sports photography - this should be it. It has a permanent place in my DVD reference library.",1140652800,19,1343,4.6
8105676,2,B000E40TI0,This book is Totally for Amateurs and play-around beginners. Nothing that you can't pick up from viewing some YouTube Videos.,1392595200,,125,5.3
8105677,1,B000E40TI0,Please make sure you're not purchasing this video as a means to turn professional. This video is absolutely for parents or beginners. Does not give enough examples in detail on where to position yourself when photographing each of the sports it covers.,1362960000,,252,5.023809523809524
8105678,5,B000E40TI0,"I just watched this video to become better taking pictures at my son's basketball games.  The video helped me a lot in knowing what to look for in capturing good shots and also setting my digital camera in the best way to get these shots.  Unfortunately, I also learned my camera and lens are not the best for gymnasium action pictures.  But at least I knew what I should work toward!",1295827200,2,384,4.380281690140845
8105679,3,B000E40TI0,"I was excited about this DVD because of all the reviews. This is a great DVD for beginners who don't know much about the DSRL. If you know the basics of shooting in A,S,P,M mode and ISO this DVD will not do much more than this for you.",1285113600,,235,3.9166666666666665
8105680,3,B000E40TI0,"Pros:
 A lot good tips such as taking pictures for several sport type, at what angle from the field, use of lights, lenses, exposure and taking pictures of specific events.

Cons:
ALL photos should (and not few of them) have the exposure information (aperture, ISO, shutter, WB, etc). Information about others sport will make this DVD better, such as car race, equestrian, boxing, boat sailing, and more about track sport

Do I recommend it?
Definitely YES, the DVD has good basic information about how to start taking pictures for sport events.

I would give it 3  stars but the AMAZON system for rating would not let me

Another good DVD for learning basic photography (No sport related) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jump-Start-Your-Photography-3-DVD-Set/dp/B002S0FR6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jump Start Your Photography 3 DVD Set</a>&nbsp;by Manny.",1281139200,,903,6.015625
8105681,5,B000E40TI0,"I am an amateur photographer who shoots mostly high school sports.  This video was very easy to follow, with great narration from the author.  He specifically does not use equipment that is out of reach for the beginner/intermediate photographer.  Every picture used in the video was taken with equipment that is relatively affordable.  This is a good video for a serious, but amateur, photographer.  It does not provide highly technical solutions for more advanced photography.  I have watched the video numerous times, usually with my camera bag in my lap, to try the different settings and suggestions as the narrator goes through each section.  As the title would suggest, this is a video focused ONLY on sports photography.",1226448000,,728,5.11864406779661
8105682,5,B000E40TI0,"Let's start by getting this right out front - this is a very well done presentation. A tightly narrated, no-nonsense overview of the topic. If you're the kind of person who's come the realization that point-and-shoot cameras are worthless for shooting sports photography regardless of how many megapixels they have, and are looking at moving up to a DSLR to start taking some decent pictures, this video is perfect for you. It's interesting and very easy to understand. It will assist you both with equipment (including selection) and technique.

If you're a photographer, digital or film, with a working understanding of exposure and other basic photographic concepts, and have a bit of experience and common sense, this DVD will be kind of wasted on you. You may pick up a couple of neat little pointers here and there, but not enough to make the purchase worthwhile. I don't say this to slam this item in any way, it's simply directed at a fairly novice audience. It's not hard-core material that will take a skilled amateur photographer, never mind a pro to the next level, and the DVD is up front about that in the first segment of the program.",1225843200,,1149,4.773869346733668
8105683,5,B000E40TI0,This is a very nice video on taking sports photography.  Doug Jensen does his thing at a very nice pace and makes sure all that are watching understands what he is saying.  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to any amateur photography wanting to understand the basics for taking sports photography.,1221782400,,306,4.754716981132075
8105684,5,B000E40TI0,I own a Cannon Digital rebel XTI.  I was looking for something to help me shoot my kids sporting events.  This CD was excellent!  Terms and settings are explained in simple laymens terms.  I highly recommend this!,1219968000,,213,4.675675675675675
8105685,5,B000E40TI0,"This video is produced with parents in mind and it's very well done.

If you are a parent of an athlete and want to take great sports photos with your consumer level DSLR there is much in this video to make it worth every penny of the price.  Get it, watch it, and go shoot ... your photos will improve.

As a sports photo pro I bought it thinking I might pick up a few pointers and/or ideas.  I did get a few things from the video, but nothing that made me stand up and cheer.

If you are a pro with a 1D Mark III and a 600mm f/4L lens, this might be the video for you.",1186876800,3,570,3.7966101694915255
