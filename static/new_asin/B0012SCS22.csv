8247662,5,B0012SCS22,I'm not Russian myself and had to follow from the subtitles but I laughed out loud.  Brilliant actors and absolutely engaging story and performances.  I found my Russian wife was searching the net for little glimpses of this movie so I found this one copy on Amazon late at night and ordered it in secret.  When I suprised her with it her face was like a child on Xmas morning. We practically watched in twice in one night and if you have home theatre its absolutely magical.  Her Mum felt it was too much a departure from the simpler tone of the first movie.  The first Irony of Fate being somewhat of a culturual icon.  We also loved the first movie but this movie is very much a welcome addition to it.  Even the packaging of the DVD was superb.  Lovely blue sparkly slip case.  The movie had so much warm blue through it.  The lead actor in particular was superb.  But then who's performance wasn't.  It was great to see the originals again although they definitely stepback to let the new leads shine through.  Can't praise this movie enough.  Must move to St. Petersburg!!!,1206489600,9,1079,4.466666666666667
