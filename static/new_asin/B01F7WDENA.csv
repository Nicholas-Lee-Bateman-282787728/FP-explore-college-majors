Also, does a great job of showing the effect on the families left behind.  This a story that needed to be told, needs to be told to a broader audience, and should be mandatory viewing for those in running Government, most of whom have never lived this life.

This is the true 1% that the American People should be talking about, the 1% that serve in our Armed Forces.",1463702400,,618,4.442477876106195
8760444,4,B01F7WDENA,"Great insight and first-hand footage. I have never served, and learned a lot about what people who do serve encounter. I enjoy memoirs and first-person experiences, such as recollections of pioneer women. This storyline is best described as a movie memoir. In 20 years it will be a great time-capsule.",1463616000,,301,5.04
