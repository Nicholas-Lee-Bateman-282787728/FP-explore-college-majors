8314924,4,B001KF6FBC,"For many, this can be a difficult opera to judge coming at the end of a sequence of masterpieces but, on the face of it, appearing to go backwards in development being described as an `opera seria' and not therefore following in the footsteps of its illustrious predecessors. Mozart himself though, described this opera as `re-worked into a true opera' in his notebook and we should all take note of this!

This opera is, to my mind, a forward -looking work of great stature where Mozart is finally able to address the universal concepts of loyalty, friendship, betrayal and forgiveness divorced from all issues of social class. The temporally distant `Roman' setting, focussing upon the unblemished character of Tito, becomes a universal stage where everyone is seen and judged on an equal footing. This makes this opera, for me, an extraordinary and astonishing leap forward into modern times.

The production that we have here makes use of a minimalist staging of clean lines intended to be timeless in effect. The costumes equally, are representative rather than intentionally historical. The use of clear-cut lighting also produces a very modern effect so the sum total of this is to bring the opera firmly into the `universal truth' type of production unfettered by precise historical considerations. It must be stressed that this is not going to be a production that will necessarily appeal to those who insist on historical accuracy or generous, strictly 'traditional' staging. Nevertheless, as one who dislikes avant garde productions which are sometimes referred to as 'Eurotrash', I personally did not find the minimalist or modernist quirks of this particular production to be damaging to my appreciation of the musical qualities of the performance. In this I am in line with other reviewers who like this disc, but there will inevitably be those who do not and who, understandably, will hold very strong views about productions such as this.

The singers, having so few props and staging at their disposal, are thus particularly focussed on the communication of the words and their dramatic effect without staging 'distractions'. The result is one of tremendous concentration and impact. This level of communication would only be possible with a cast of considerable singing and acting ability and that is certainly what we have here. It would be invidious to highlight particular members of the cast given such evenness of quality. Suffice it to mention their roles as being of equal merit - Christoph Pregardien as Tito, Susan Graham as Sesto, Catherine Naglestad as Vitellia, Hannah Minutillo as Annio, Ekaterina Siurina as Servilia and Roland Gracht as Publio. The fine and incisive orchestra is conducted with energy and flair by Sylvain Camreling

The recording is outstanding with crisp imaging and sympathetic camera work which is totally involving. The sound is of the high standard one has come to expect of Opus Arte and is presented in surround and stereo formats.

There is an extended bonus film of about 60 minutes which takes the form of a thorough explanation of the work and its performance seen through the eyes of the producer and cast members. This is informative and interesting with many examples extracted from the recording to illustrate the points being made.

I would suggest that this can be classed as a very fine production and performance indeed. I would expect such a recorded achievement to give considerable satisfaction to most purchasers and see no musical reason to withhold any of the full 5 stars. The purely musical values are outstanding. For those who have doubts about the production values themselves as outlined above I would suggest checking on various on-line examples which are currently available to view before purchasing.

In summary therefore I would suggest that this disc should warrant serious consideration by potential purchasers. I would also suggest that they also investigate an equally fine, but different concept and performance at Salzburg, conducted by Harnoncourt with Schade, Kasarova, Roschmann, Bonney and Garanca in the lead roles.",1356480000,,4113,5.1852409638554215
8314925,4,B001KF6FBC,"This video would be much more enjoyable were it not for the disappointing performance from Pregardien.  He seems to have a bit of trouble in the passagio, is often forced to go to mezza-voce, and is off-key a few times.

That being said, it's almost worth buying this video for Susan Graham's Sesto.  Her singing in the role is simply a dream.  I also enjoyed Naglestad quite well, and the Servilia.  The Annio, I personally enjoyed very much, but she was off-key a few times.  (And her hair-do was stupid.)  I noticed later that she was actually quite good, but that compared to the perfection of Graham, flaws were evident that one would not have otherwise noticed, with another singing partner.

The production was generally tasteful, with just a few super-weird bits thrown in.  In the first act, I could have sworn I saw a baked-potato roll by with a human being sitting in the cut-open, buttery part.  Then it went away, and nothing else so absurd seemed to happened.  A couple times Vitellia seemed to be eating fruit from off the floor and she applied some war-paint to her face while Sesto sang, 'Parto, parto...', but other than these brief oddities, and Annio's hair, everything seemed fairly normal - a semi-modern setting and aesthetically pleasant enough.

After watching the dvd a couple more times, I will say it's probably worth getting.  Pregardien seemed less bad to me after the first time, although he is just SO light-voiced; he really leaves you wanting just a touch of heroism.  The drama of the video led me to love this opera all the more and made me think deeper about the characters and their actions and words, though it definitely would have been nicer to have a better Tito to back up Graham's peerless Sesto.  (And yes, there was a baked potato with a human in it in the first act.  Not sure why.)

BTW, the Publio is just mediocre.",1238716800,4,1864,4.634146341463414
