Really, you guys at Amazon, it's been ages since Picket Fences premiered on TV and we still cannot buy it! Though it is so easy to download the episodes, the enjoyment of owning them is difficult to describe. It is also difficult to ""star rate"" a series before its formal/official release.

Come on Amazon, how much longer must we wait to watch our favourite Sheriff Brock and his team in action??

Moreover, giving this series a 5 star rating is in my view, unjustified no matter what people may feel, since Series 2 - 4 have not been released on DVDs. That's what we are reviewing, right?

Waiting impatiently,

3426242,5,B001990LNC,"Having released complete DVD collections of the David E. Kelley classic signature gems ""Boston Legal"" and ""Ally McBeal"" during the past six months, I am so seriously hoping that Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment re-opens the vaults to that small-town wonder ""Picket Fences"".  Every Friday night at 9.30 on Network Ten, here in Australia, I would bathe in its warm glow of compelling drama and delightful eccentricity.  The stories coming out of Rome, Wisconsin often touched on headline events and issues concerning small towns, nations, and the world of its time - making it the perfect 1990s time capsule, and yet, a timeless classic.  Please TCFHE!!!! Please consider a DVD release of Seasons 2 - 4.  And, with a Season 3 release which contains the Picket Fences/Chicago Hope crossover episode ""Rebels With Causes"", perhaps I should also add that I am absolutely in favour of a Complete First Season DVD release of ""Chicago Hope"".",1255392000,28,940,5.084415584415584

3426304,5,B001990LNC,"The second season of Picket Fences increased the action, quirkiness and to be honest farfetchedness of the episodes, but it sure was a lot of fun to watch again.  The second season has a few different mayors for Rome, Wisconsin, we get to know a lot more about a lot of the minor and main character town residents and Howard becomes a lot more interesting than just an old Alzheimers guy who claims he's just murdered someone.  Rome gets a new district attorney, played by Don Cheadle allowing the show to tackle race related issues in the courtroom, there's even a trial where James Earl Jones opposes him revolving around a black drug dealer who shot dead two white cops.

Season two kicks off (spoiler alerts obviously), with the mayor shooting dead a carjacker who wasn't a physical threat but made verbal ones and of course it's up to Judge Bone to rule.  Other notable happenings include the Brock children building a potato missile launcher type contraption to scare a bully that goes wrong, which results in one of them being shot by the brother who brings a gun to school to get even.  A teacher is brought before the PCA because a number of kids including Zachary become interested in switching to his religion.  A deaf bank robber (played by the lines-woman from Seinfeld), in fact the two shows must have used the same casting agency as you'll notice Sue Ellen (character wore a bra as a top), ""high talker"" and a few other one episode actors in Season 2 of Picket.  Kimberly is abducted by Louis Gossett Jr. Wambaugh instructs a drunk driver to have a drink as Max allowed her to go sit in her house while dealing with the serious injury to the victim in the other car. A rude morbidly obese woman confesses to killing her husband by sitting on his head but keeps refusing legal or other advice.  A priest faces losing his job when it is found he collects woman's shoes (this one didn't really seem plausible at all, from being arrested to everything else, but it's Picket Fences and that adds to the fun).

The second season also forces the viewer to look at  some societal issues such domestic violence, as well as can a woman rape a man? The rights of an unborn baby over the religious wishes not to prolong life. Should a parent be able to donate their heart (and obviously die) to their kid if that child will die otherwise?

Season two continues to have the piano playing in the background the theme song at all kinds of speeds from fast for everyone's having a great time to slow when regular characters pass away.  Picket Fences was definitely one of the greatest shows of the 90's.",1446076800,2,2603,4.538461538461538

3426306,5,B001990LNC,"Comedic, Germaine, the plots are created from the news events of the day, generally with three levels simultaneously. The creator is the same genius who later created Boston Legal.  I wish that this would be released in the US, or at least in a country from whom we could order it in NTSC.  PAL  doesn't work here.

APART FROM THE PRACTICE, THIS WAS THE BEST DAVID E KELLY SHOW, ALLEY AND BOSTON-LEGAL WERE TOO STUPID AND SLEAZY FOR WORDS, LEFT WING RUBBISH BEING SHOVED DOWN YOUR THROAT FOR THE WHOLE DURATION OF THE SHOW, PICKET FENCES HOWEVER; ALTHOUGH FILLED WITH THE SAME OLD ILL THOUGHT UP LEFT WING TWADDLE, WAS MORE A DISCUSSION THAN A SERMON; MOST SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT AT LEAST GOT AIR TIME.
ALL OF THAT ASIDE - IT WAS A WONDEROUS SHOW FOR 3 SEASONS, WONDERFUL CHARACTERS, GREAT QUIRKY STORIES, AND RATHER INTELLEGENT DISCUSSIONS ON TOPICS THAT ARE STILL RELEVANT FOR DISCUSSION TODAY. GREAT IDEA HAVING LAW AND MEDICINE AT LOGGERHEADS IN THE ONE FAMILY - CUTE KIDS - CARTER IS A RIOT - MAXINE IS A STUNNER AND FUNNY AS A FIT ALL DECKED OUT IN HER RIOT GEAR - KENNY'S ""THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE MOMENTS ARE A SCREAM; AND THE OLD BEAUTIFUL JEWISH LAYWER IS A LAUGH A MINUTE - PRICELESS FIND IN THAT GREAT ACTOR - AND NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE JUDGE IS A FANTASTIC ANCHOR FOR THE WHOLE SHEBANG-
WHAT A SHOW AND WHAT A SHAME TO WHATEVER COMPANY OWNS THE RIGHTS TO THIS SHOW THAT THEY HAVE STILL NOT PUT THE WHOLE THING OUT ON DISC ALREADY. THE ONE SHOW I HAVE TO KEEP WATCHING NO MATTER HOW LATE IN THE NIGHT IT GETS - ONE OF THOSE RARE 'JUST ONE MORE EPISODE BEFORE BEDTIME' SHOWS.
THE MUSIC IS ALSO WONDERFUL.
WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT SHOWS THAT ARE LABELLED ""THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THAT ANYMORE"" HOWEVER, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE MOMENTS WHERE SUCH A LABEL IS ACCURATE, (I WOULD ALSO ADD NOTHERN EXPOSURE TO THAT SHORT LIST - IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, GET IT IMMEDIATELY - SAME OLD NEW AGE LEFT WING TWADDLE, BUT PRICELESS CHARACTERS AND STORIES ALL THE SAME, THE EPISODE ""SLOW DANCE"" HAS AN ENDING THAT RANKS WITH THE ENDING OF CASABLANCA - I KID YOU NOT!).

WE CAN HAVE 8 SEASONS OF TWO AND HALF UNFUNNY HALFWITS ON DISC;
TWO BROKEN SLEAZEBAGS ON DISC,
JERSY SNORE- OH PLEASE SOMEBODY GET ME A GUN OR AT LEAST INVENT AN OPERATION THAT REVERSES FRONTAL LABOTOMIES FOR THOSE POOR FOUL MOUTHED WASTES OF SPACE SHOWING OFF THEIR ROLLS OF FAT AND I GOT NOTHING GOING FOR ME BUT A SIX-PACK; I DON'T THINK JERSY'S BRAGGING ABOUT THE CRETINS ON THIS SHOW BEING FROM THEIR 'HOOD';
AND OF COURSE WE HAVE HOW I SCREWED EVERYTHING ON TWO LEGS BEFORE YOUR POOR UNFORTUNATE MOTHER GOT SADDLED WITH ME FOR THE REST OF HER MISERABLE LIFE ET AL -

I mean, it's not like it was the GREATEST show ever to air on U.S. television.  Oh, wait, IT WAS!

So, could someone explain why it hasn't been released?  Who should we blackmail, extort, or even KILL to get this done?

This was one of the wonderful shows that fell into America's heart with odd-ball characters that you just had to fall in love with.  With outrageous legal battles that you still don't see now-a-days as well as children that really are/were....children of that era.  The difficult situations were always handled with just a hint of humor to lighten the mood and in the end, you were on the edge of your seats and couldn't wait for the following week for more, more, more!  Well, we are still waiting for it!  Please release the remaining seasons so that we can all go back down memory lane and enjoy the ranting of a fair Martian judge, a conniving but lovable lawyer who will do or say anything to get his client off, a senile old man who ""killed"" everyone in the town and was always happy to tell everyone about it, the loving angst between two cops wanting each-other as well as the same position, and parents that clearly loved one another dealing with issues that some parents had to face, as well as ones that nobody had to face, i.e. standing on the side of an elephant and pulling a cheek aside because he needed an enema!  Love and admiration goes out to the cast and crew of this incredible show as well as David E. Kelley who would have kept Shakespeare on the seat of his hose!",1299024000,19,1354,4.417670682730924

8272717,4,B001990LNC,"So stoked! I thought I'd take a chance on buying the Australia release of Season Two, since US fans have been screwed on seeing this show here beyond the season one release years ago.  There were no definitive answers online about whether or not I might be able to view the discs on my particular DVD player, and it looked like it might also come down to whether or not my American purchased television would display it, even if my DVD player was inclined to play it.  BUT it seemed that playing them on my PC was highly likely to work, so I thought I'd buy the set and watch it on my computer for the time being and then invest in a multi region player if all else failed. I'm happy to report, lo and behold I had no problems playing the discs on my American electronics.  So all in all, your luck with the region four set may be hit or miss, as seen by other reviews here.  If you know you wouldn't mind buying a multi-region player, you might find it worth it to try this set and see if your DVD player will play it.  A couple of heads up:  the product info on Amazon shows these as ""Region 0,""  which in theory should play on any DVD player, but the set I got did in fact say ""Region 4"" on the packaging; also, the aspect ratio may leave a lot to be desired for some.  It displays on my TV as a square view in the center of the screen, and I haven't played around with the different view options available for my television to see if some of them may display in a reasonably view-able way.  But that's a minor issue for me.  I'm just glad that I can watch season two of this show finally! I'll be giving the other seasons a try since I got lucky here.",1487721600,5,1655,4.064615384615385
