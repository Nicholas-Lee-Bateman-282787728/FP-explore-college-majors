I AM A BACKYARD WRESTLER MYSELF AND I DO ALOT OF XTREME STUFF BUT I WOULD NEVER DO ANY OF THE THINGS THESE GUYS DO!! THESE VIDEOS ARE AMAZING!",1015977600,,274,4.5
7951786,5,B00005R1MT,"Himself who memorized impression to activity of U.S. Backyard Wrestler very much thought that each organization's video would come to hand involving a far and near site after previous work acquisition, and although mail was sent to the persons involved in each organization, the reaction did not come on the contrary....
More hardcore bout which the contents did not have in a previous work was recorded.
A favorite scene is the sublime dive from the seat for audience of the topmost part of a gymnasium.
Since there is nothing only when they are enumerated although there are many other favorite scenes, it stops.
The further sequel is counted on anyway.",1001808000,,655,4.963636363636364
7951787,1,B00005R1MT,"I am a backyard wrestler myself, and I hate to be viewed in this negative light.  Not all backyard feds are like these stupid redneck ones in this tape.  My backyard fed, JWA (Jersey Wrestling Alliance) has strong ties in the wrestling business, and most of us hope to one day, make it to the big time.  However, throwing people through flaming tables, jumping off roofs of houses, or even using a trampoline is stupid, dangerous, and overall played out. We pride ourselves on actual wrestling and storylines.  Can we get violent?  At times, but not as violent as they portray these groups to be on this tape.  These kids aren't wrestling, they are mutilating each other, and I am embarassed to have my name associated with trash such as this.  Backyard wrestling doesn't have to be shed in such a negative light all the time, as there are feds out there, like mine, which take pride in doing what we do best, and that's WRESTLING!  Maybe Volume 3 can shed some light on the more technical backyard feds out there like ours, but considering the attention span of today's society, I highly doubt it'll sell like these two tapes.  I'm out.

7951788,5,B00005R1MT,"I LOVED volume #1 Future Kings Of The Ring.  but this volume truly is MORE HARDCORE THAN EVER BEFORE!!!
The bumps are insane, the action is non-stop.  I watched it with all my buddies.  Great Work..Keep it up.",985132800,2,209,4.447368421052632
7951789,5,B00005R1MT,If you want hardcore action with non-stop entertaining stunts. Then buy this video NOW! The first video was amazing. The second lives up to what the first video was all about. Hardcore ACTION! Buy NOW!!!!!,982713600,2,205,4.885714285714286
7951790,1,B00005R1MT,"Ok, I have to admit it is pretty impressive (hardcore-wise). But I am gonna list the faults. First of all...there are no full matches and all the clips are people that cannot wrestle. Its a bunch of 17 year old rednecks killing each other with hardcore items, yes its cool, but you won't watch it more than once. It gest boring and the entire video might show 1-5 real wrestling moves at the most. A hurrincanrana and a back body-flip splash were the only good moves in the entire video. And a few piledrivers as well. These are not the future kings of the rings, they don't even know how to wrestle. THeir bodies will be too banged up by the time they are old enough to apply to a wrestling school. Number two, they are a bunch of redneck and white trash. If you want to see bad wrestling, a lot of blood, and commentary by a bunch of white trash with hick accents, then this video is for you. Number 3, after you watch this video, you probably won't like hardcore wrestling as much anymore. It goes to the exctreme too much and it shows an hour of hardcore wrestling to the point that a chairshot or a person through a table doesnt even seem special to you anymore. It degrades hardcore wrestling.",977011200,,1199,4.333333333333333
7951791,5,B00005R1MT,"When I read the editorial revues of the THE BEST OF BACKYARD WRESTLING  FUTURE KINGS OF THE RING and MORE HARDCORE THAN EVER BEFORE  I couldn't  beleive it.  then i ordered the tapes!  I must say, I am impressed.  I  consider myself a tough critic when it comes to wild and extreme  tapes...but i've just never seen anything like this.  The cool thing is  that the tape does so much more than just display hardcore sloppy violence.  it is produced inj a way that keeps you watching through the whole tape.  HIGHLY ENTERTAINING!  I can't recomend anything more than these two  tapes...by far the coolest thing I've ever seen.  I WANT MORE!!!",965001600,,640,4.589285714285714
