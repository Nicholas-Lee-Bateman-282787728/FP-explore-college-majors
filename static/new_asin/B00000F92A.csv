Taken in snippets, I found it entertaining, but I am not sure I would have felt the same way if I'd watched it straight through.  Kind of an odd little outing.",1482192000,,296,4.547169811320755

The story begins with a steam locomotive on a western railroad passing through Winston Arizona. Mr. Shelby sees a lawyer and learns about a loss of cattle at his ranch. He will ride out and inspect the ranch. Will he be mistaken for a ranch hand? How long will he last at this job? Who put a snake on that bed? Mr. Hepburn's legs are healing. A box canyon has only one entrance. A shot scares ""Romeo"" and Nebraska away. ""Romeo"" gets to drive a wagon. Will the foreman order his boys to question ""Romeo""? Ann hides in that wagon. Shelby talks to the lawyer. Ann is the belle of the ball. ""Romeo"" cuts in. There is comedy in what could have been serious trouble. The ""meanest and stubbornest"" dude? Ann discovers her father can ride now! The herefords are herded in a round-up. Somebody gets a pay-off at that box canyon.

Ann confides in ""Dude"" about her father. He visits her father in the morning. Later ""Dude"" tries to check the books. Hepburn catches Highcliff at the safe! Somebody calls the doctor. The rest of the men pursue the ""Dude"". Shelby tells Ann the truth, and is rejected. Nebraska warns Shelby about the gang. ""Dude"" captures Highcliff! Hepburn tells who shot him. ""Dude"" returns with Highcliff and the money, and gets a kiss from Ann. [The loose strings are left untied, but you can guess what comes next.]

This was adapted from a story by Zane Grey. The story about an undercover investigator was used in many other movies. Parts of this movie seem implausible.",1287100800,,1508,4.557195571955719
