7906305,5,B00000F1MJ,"Tony Ryder (Dean Martin) never took a real interest in his uncles publishing business until his uncle died. Now the rest of the board of directors does not know what to expect. Luckily it looks like Tony is able to carry of the moral tradition of the magazine.

There is just one hitch, turns out the hotel detective reports that Uncle Rider died with a smile on his face and a woman clad only in a towel was scene leaving the room. The only clue to her identity is an earring with the Chinese symbol for ""good.""

Tony and the board brace themselves knowing that they are ripe for the picking (black mail) by this mysterious woman. If only they could find her and someone foil her plot.

This film was a long time coming let alone on DVD. You will want to watch it again once you know the story to see the clues that were not so obvious the first time around.
