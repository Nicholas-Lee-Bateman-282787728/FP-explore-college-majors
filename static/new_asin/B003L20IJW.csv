4136679,5,B003L20IJW,"I just plain love the character of Nanny McPhee - she's magical yet kind of a scary Mary Poppins until you get to know her. I ordered the first movie ""Nanny McPhee"" (made in 2005) after I had seen it on TV. I collect movies and have a self-made rule - if I see a movie on TV and then watch it every time I see that it's on, once I've watched it five times and enjoy it as much as I did the first time, I buy it if it's available. That's just me and it may seem nuts to some people, but that's how I do it. Anyway, of course I had to get this 2010 sequel and it is absolutely delightful. This time, instead of Nanny dealing with a harried father's unruly kids she's dealing with a harried mother's unruly kids and their city cousins. It takes place during WWII on a farm in the English countryside. Emma Thompson IS Nanny McPhee - I can't imagine any other actress in the role. The cast of characters is remarkably imaginative and the actors/actresses who play them are absolutely believeable in their roles. This sequel, just like the first one, is rated PG, but the parents who sit down and watch it with their kids will enjoy it just as much as the kids. If you don't have ""Nanny McPhee"" I advise you get it along with this one as there is a wonderful short reference to it at the end of this sequel which shows, beyond a doubt, that Nanny McPhee is immortal - and if you haven't seen the first one you'll miss the reference. I hope there will be another Nanny McPhee movie because, if there is, I'm adding it to the collection.",1423440000,3,1530,4.154882154882155

I had not even heard of Nanny McPhee, but the cover looked a bit 'Mary Poppins-ish', and I have a 9 year old girl who likes such films.  We had no idea how great this movie would be!  We were both delighted, and want to watch it again soon!  It's a very well done film with great acting by Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal, as well as the child actors.  It was also cool to see Nanny McPhee transformed from this old, homely hag to a beautiful lady towards the end of the movie.  And of course, the happy ending was perfect!  The English countryside and farmlands were also breathtakingly beautiful on Blu-ray!  We now can't wait to find and watch the first Nanny McPhee movie.",1419033600,,836,4.383116883116883

Emma Thompson is very hard to recognize if immediately look for her, Maggie Smith as an eccentric older lady who was helped by Nanny McPhee at some point in her life is a wonderful addition to the cast.  Well done, moves along, takes you to a bad place at a bad time and shows you that life doesn't have to be bad and with a little magic it can be incredibly enjoyable.",1415059200,,425,4.0476190476190474

They changed it around.  Then at the end reviling who the old lady was is a good touch.  It tied everything together nicely.  Made me wonder if it was not planned before the 1st book was completed that the 2nd would work out this way.  Not a big deal but something to consider.,1369180800,,560,3.8421052631578947

Just as before, this new cast of kids are great little performers.  Emma Thompson returns as Nanny McPhee, and this time Maggie Smith plays an eccentric character.  There's lots of mischievousness on the part of the children, as well as their conniving uncle.

Because of Nanny McPhee's scary makeup and costume and fighting among the children, I would recommend this movie for ages 6 and up.  This second movie also contains a pretty sad scene in which the mother and children gets news that the father has died in the war.  It made me shed a couple of tears, so it might be a bit much for small children.  Don't worry though...it has a happy ending.

These movies are full of laughs, but I also like that they actually teach some good moral lessons.  I'm glad my granddaughter convinced me to watch these.  I'm sure they'll be repeats on our sleepover nights.",1364083200,3,1002,4.642045454545454

We learn a tiny bit more about our new favorite nanny and learn she's a lot more well known to a lot of people. The magic is a bit more overt and the script is more playful, despite some pretty serious challenges the family in need has to face.

It has its sweet elements:  the scenery is beautiful, there is a happy ending, Emma Thompson is her lovely self at the end and Maggie Smith is a delight, as always.  But....the plot is predictable and the fantastical magical elements are contrived.  I did like Nanny McPhee's crow familiar who had a lot of charming personality.  The movie did make me smile and brought moments of misty-eyed sentiment, but I don't need to own this or see it again.",1353888000,,553,4.5353535353535355

As another reviewer put it, and which I agree with completely, Nanny McPhee Returns was charming, funny, touching and intelligent.  Like the first, this is a wonderful family film that I think adults and younger minds will enjoy.

In short, I think the positive reviews pretty much dismiss those few negative reviews I've read.  For the price, it's an enjoyable sequel; wouldn't mind having Nanny return just one more time!",1353628800,,615,5.0594059405940595
4137371,1,B003L20IJW,"This sequel works on the tired premise that if one is good, more is better. So there are a lot more special effects, most utterly unnecessary, and it's a lot louder, but the touching charm of the first is totally absent. The lessons these children need to learn are given lip service at best, and while the cast is good they are wasted. Set in WW2, Gyllenhaal saddled with an English accent when one line of exposition would have avoided it must keep up the family farm... Yadda Yadda Yadda. Because this is a ""family"" movie someone made the decision that reality needed to be absent so an enemy airplane (this is wartime in Britain when children are evacuated to the country to avoid bombing in London) is labeled as ""enemy aircraft"". Heaven forbid children should learn even the tiniest bit about the war, no let's put a gag in here.
Thompson's script is paint by numbers, with all the tough problems solved by more magic and only the tiniest nod to the rules set up in the first one... Enormously disappointing.",1353542400,3,1014,4.576923076923077

Our whole family could enjoy the different layers of humor, and it can be hard to find something that satisfies ages 3 to adults.  The lessons are ones that parents can appreciate and children can understand.  Emma Thompson has outdone herself again.",1353369600,,349,4.9655172413793105
4137373,5,B003L20IJW,"This has to be one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to see.  Emma Thompson has done a truly magnificent piece of work with ""Nanny McPhee Returns.""  As much as I liked Nanny McPhee, this movie outstrips it.  Not only did Emma Thompson do a magnificent job writing the screenplay, but she was splendid again as the rather homely Nanny McPhee.
When she first comes to the door you find yourself unconsciously asking yourself, ""Where did she park her broom?""  Nanny McPhee, at first, is a very homely, overweight woman with warts and a buck tooth that has to be seen to be believed.  Despite her appearance, she definitely projects an air of unquestionable authority, though at first the children do question it, as youngsters will do.  Slowly but surely she teaches them the lessons they need, assisted at times by a thump of her magical cane on the floor.
In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nanny-McPhee-Returns/dp/B005SMWC0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nanny McPhee Returns</a>, there are three rather unruly children who are the despair of their mother, since their father has been called off to WWII.  To throw some pepper into the soup, their two cousins arrive from the city.  It is obvious from the get-go that the two cousins are spoiled brats, so you have a fair idea of just why Nanny McPhee shows up.  The five youngsters (obviously) do not get along at all, and in fact Nanny McPhee has to quite literally show them who's boss, which she does rather well.
There is more of her magic, but unlike Mary Poppins there are no songs to carry the story along and, in truth, they are not needed.
To add to the mother's problems, her smarmy brother-in-law is trying to get her to sell the farm.  There is an ulterior motive for his actions: he's in debt over his ears to a casino.  Worse, the casino owner has sent his ""Hit-men,"" actually two rather bloodthirsty women, to collect.
An interesting tidbit is the jackdaw that hangs around Nanny McPhee and hold conversations with her.  The bird is forever belching because it has a habit of eating window putty.  This bird, and several other things, move the show right along.  I must add that Dame Maggie Smith (remember her as Prof. McGonnagal in ""Harry Potter""?) is absolutely delightful as the little old lady who runs the local store.  She (and several others) remember Nanny McPhee very kindly.  At the end of the film you find out why, but only if you saw the first film.
All in all, this is a truly delightful film, in spite of a little over-the-top acting on the part of the brother-in-law and the two ladies(?).  If you liked the first Nanny McPhee, you are going to love this one, too.  I do highly recommend it, and I'm very glad I have it.",1352246400,,2756,4.766315789473684

What was charming in the first movie, upon replay, became flat and disappointing. Not even Maggie Smith could overcome a poorly-written, poorly-directed script. She became just another cartoon character. Over-reliance on stock characters (e.g. the deceitful brother-in-law) made it a cartoon instead of a movie. Magic, plus slow pacing, made this movie a tired attempt to earn money off the McPhee franchise. The ending relied too much on special effects to draw it out like some sort of fireworks-like grand finale, but it became boring halfway through.",1348963200,,705,5.139130434782609

4137416,2,B003L20IJW,"My family enjoyed the first Nanny McPhee movie.  I found the 2nd one to be disappointing.  There are some major plot flaws in it.  For example, in the beginning, the 3 children are behaving and doing their chores.  They do argue with the cousins once they arrive, but they are not terrible like the children in the first movie. They are not in desperate need of Nanny McPhee.  The mother is at work when the cousins arrive, so she can't possibly know anything is wrong at all, but this is when she figures out she needs Nanny McPhee.  It didn't make sense.

After that, the movie was ok.  I did like the ending, and how they connected it to the first movie.

Also, I would not consider the Blu-Ray version to truly be ""blu-ray quality"".  It was, perhaps, a slight upgrade over the DVD version, but not by much.",1314489600,,810,4.375838926174497

4137438,3,B003L20IJW,"Nanny again confronted juvenile challenges, this time with the addition of a city versus county conflict.  The children were brats who learned their lessons the McPhee magical way. Nanny was much more a known quality to persons outside of the family being helped, for example, in London, she wore a British military uniform and had significant rank (although without rank insignia). She was also more willing to actively use her magic in this movie. In the first movie, she seemed reluctant to use her magic until the children needed it or had exhausted all of their available resources. The key values promoted by Nanny were accepted by the children and the ending was well done.  As with the first movie, Nanny brought in colleagues from the Harry Potter movies, this time bringing in Ralph Finnes (Lord Voldemort)and others. This movie was good but not as creative (or perhaps ""innovative"")like the first movie. Perhaps the novelty of the magical walking stick was gone. But, watching city kids dressed in city clothes chasing escaping piglets was funny! Adults would see the movie as a sequel, kids would enjoy it.",1314144000,,1118,4.973262032085562

4137443,4,B003L20IJW,"Emma Thompson is an artist of s many gifts that she defies categorization.  In addition to being one of our best actresses of the day, she is also a very fine writer and not at all afraid of jumping into 'family movies' that bundle fun as well as sage advice.  Her she has written and stars in NANNY MCPHEE RETURNS and lets hope this isn't her last visit.

Nanny McPhee appears as a grotesquely ugly woman who arrives in households besotted with potential disasters and in the course of her manipulations of the microcosm that initiated the problems she has a sense of magic in reversing the behavior patterns of children and adults to bring about a happy ending to a crisis waiting to happen.  This trip finds her visiting the farm of Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whose husband (Ewan McGregor) is off at war, leaving the care of the three children and the farm and life in general in her hands.  Add to that the constant interference of Isabel's pestering brother-in-law (Rhys Ifans) and a battery of spoiled cousins and the madness of a misplaced bomb form the sky and Nanny has her hands full teaching the children not only how to cope but also how to behave in a manner that aids Isabel's survival.  Maggie Smith joins this irrepressible cast and in the end it is difficult to judge what entertains most - the madness or the glee.  Deep it is not, but it is one of those films you can slip into the telly and enjoy as much as an adult as the youngsters adore it. Fantasy, a bit of family drama, and a lot of fine lessons make this a fluffy movie nearly everyone can enjoy. Grady Harp, June 11",1308528000,,1600,4.421768707482993

It's seriousness is drowned out by loads of silly comedy (goofball brother in law-- hit women--swimming pigletts--and burping crow).

The plot, dialogue, and humor are all aimed at the younger crowd so adults should be warned in advance to expect something for the children. Having said that, the children should be pleased and excited by the progress of the movie and even the adults may be satisfied with the way the movie ends.

This movie delves more into the fantasy elements and demonstrates what miraculous things Nanny McPhee can do; most of these will delight the children even though they don't advance the story.

There was no real love interest to peak your curiosity or hold your interest like in the first movie. The villain was just a total moron and a pathetic part of the story.

4137531,3,B003L20IJW,"I liked the first Nanny McPhee film the best.  It seemed to focus on the people and their issues and on resolving them.  Magic was part of it, but the magic of family was the important part of it.  It made fun of adulthood and of unrestrained childhood without seeming to go beyond the pale.  Furthermore the romance was delightfully comic, making Colin Firth, a former Mr. Darcy, a somewhat helpless and comic widower.

With Nanny McPhee Returns the story seemed way too melodramatic and relied too heavily on special effects.  That Nanny is a witch is obvious and acceptable as it was before, but here there was so much magic that the story seemed to get lost until the very end.  I felt the film worked too hard and employed almost every time worn concept:  ""eat your green vegetables"" to a grown man who'd been a ward of Nanny in the past.  Not to mention that green vegetables, let alone cheese, during World War II would have been a welcome treat.

The antics seemed intended more to lengthen the film than to enhance the story.  Children chasing escaped piglets seemed quite manic and amusing enough, that the piglets should also do 1930s swimming routines and acrobatics was a little much; in short it felt patronizing.  It was as though a group of adults sitting around a conference table tried to decide what would ""entertain"" children without really considering that children are people and they do get the point of things.

More than anything I felt that these devices distracted from the true story, that of children sent away for adult reasons (insensitive parents facing divorce and a war), children faced with destitution by virtue of adult greed and circumstances (shortage of field workers due to a war and a wicked--and quite funny--uncle), children faced with the possible loss of a parent due to war, and most important, children learning to appreciate others, their actions, and their world view.  That magic should bring the lessons home is acceptable, especially in a children's story, but total nonsense seems egregious.",1293753600,3,2045,4.839080459770115

4137534,4,B003L20IJW,"Nanny McPhee's working credo goes like this: ""When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me but no longer need me, then I have to go."" Except who would want to gaze at Nanny McPhee, perhaps the universe's ugliest deus ex machina? But there is implication to her homeliness, a meaning to her monobrow and hairy warts and snaggletooth.

The story is set in rural England, somewhen in the early '40s. On a muddy, poo-ridden farmhouse, harried young mother Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) struggles to raise her three boisterous children, with her husband gone off to fight in the big war. The tipping point arrives in the span of one day, in the shape of her very difficult niece and nephew come to stay on the farm while London is being bombed. Her kids and their cousins promptly commence a feud. As a cherry on top, in slinks her worthless brother-in-law (Rhys Ifans), waving his unwanted paperwork, trying to convince Mrs. Green to sell the farm, mostly so that he could pay off his gambling debts. The evening having gone all blustery and ominous, Mrs. Green, at her wits' end, responds to a knock on her door and glimpses on her doorstep the unsightly governess Nanny McPhee, there to impart five important lessons on the children. The lightning flashing in the background accentuates Nanny McPhee's gross unbecoming features. When Mrs. Green insists that she doesn't need help, Nanny McPhee states formally: ""I am an Army nanny, Mrs. Green. I have been... deployed."" In a wartime era, that's enough to sway a person.

Emma Thompson writes the screenplay and demonstrates again that she's got her finger on the pulse of what makes a fantasy family picture work. NANNY MCPHEE RETURNS is enchanting and whimsical and quite funny. And, amidst the synchronized-swimming pigs and belching jackdaws and lady heavies and perhaps the most fun defusing of a bomb ever, we're treated to some very good dramatic beats which lend depth and ground the fable. If you've seen the first movie, Maggie Smith discloses a neat, unexpected bit of continuity near the end of the movie.

Only tell me that Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal are sharing camera time, and it's enough to inform me of that film's quality. In the Maggie Gyllenhaal Can Do No Wrong Department, Maggie affects a pretty darn convincing English accent, and she's wonderful, as expected. You soon enough warm up to the alarming magical Nanny McPhee, especially as it's neat to see one of her facial flaws vanish each time the children learn a lesson. The children, who tend to make or break movies like this, are fairly terrific. That reprobate Uncle Phil, you won't recognize him as such, but actor Rhys Ifans is the same bloke who played Hugh Grant's odd flat mate in NOTTING HILL. Also, Ralph Fiennes cameos in one of those scenes that simply elevates the film as a whole.

Mary Poppins who?

No, I take that back. I still love Mary Poppins. But is it me or doesn't Nanny McPhee come across as an ultimately warmer character than Mary Poppins?

The DVD's bonus features: Director Susanna White's audio commentary; 12 deleted scenes with introductory captions (totaling 00:15:03 minutes); two featurettes ""A Look Inside"" (00:02:38) and ""New Film, New Story"" (00:04:09) give behind-the-scenes peeks at the film; ""Magical Moves"" - about the sequence in which the children are bewitched into punishing themselves for fighting (00:01:53); ""Mr. Edelweiss"" - spotlight on the magical belching jackdaw bird that's hooked on window putty (00:02:04); ""Emma Thompson Becomes Nanny McPhee"" - the arduous make-up process, from start to finish, shown thru time-lapse (00:01:39); ""The Pigs"" featurette - believe it or not, some CG was involved in the piglet sequences (00:03:42); and ""The Mud"" featurette - yes, the cast & crew talk about the mud in the film (00:02:04).",1293321600,,3841,4.910631741140215
4137535,3,B003L20IJW,"Unlike the first film, the one in my opinion is more strongly targeted to children only. The amount of ""magic"" and such just more strongly exaggerated in this one.

The movie lost momentum during long magical sequences where the film maker had multiple and extended scenes such as pigs flying and then without coming up for air going into a synchronized swimming routine - too long and does not add to the story.

The story line became stale trying to wait out the exaggerated magic special effects.  The effects did not provide a satisfying subsitute for either the lack of interesting characters or the absence of a compelling story.  Why for example did the brother-in-law get himself into such a pickle during the war that caused him to need half the farm's value.  He goes bad with little screen time as to why or what kind of family the father's family is. The father is not someone we actually learn about during the movie beside being naturally the love interest of the mother.

This movie would have benefited from better editing and a tighter script.",1292976000,,975,4.6395348837209305
4137537,4,B003L20IJW,"It's great to see Nanny McPhee back, although quite why the UK title (Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang) was jettisoned for the pedestrian 'Nanny McPhee Returns', I'm not sure. However, the lady who talks softly but carries a big stick is as magical as ever.

Moving the setting forward to World War Two creates a different ambience for the action, with a purple Rolls-Royce, a supercharged motorbike and an enemy bomber all contributing to the story. There are more computer graphics with this film, but they are so expertly done that it's often hard to see where reality ends and studio wizardry takes over. Do watch the excellent bonus features for some insights into how the special effects were produced.

The acting is excellent, including Maggie Gyllenhaal as the harassed mother, Rhys Ifans as the villainous Uncle Phil, Ralph Fiennes in a cameo as Cyril and Celia's father and the inimitable Maggie Smith as the eccentric shopkeeper who has a little secret of her own. The children are also uniformly wonderful and the whole thing is held together by Emma Thompson as the lady with the lumps (with the assistance of Mr. Edelweiss).

I've rated this movie as one star less than the first NM, mainly because there isn't the same sense of antagonism between the children and Nanny McPhee as there was in the first film. Their 'not wanting her', part of the reason for her being there, doesn't manifest itself very much and soon they are routinely calling on her for help. They also seem to be doing pretty well at learning her lessons on their own; at one point, she even remarks that things shouldn't be too easy and promptly gives them an entirely fresh, and magical, challenge. This lack of tension somewhat changes the dynamics of the movie and it becomes more the children and Nanny McPhee against the bad guys than Nanny McPhee teaching the children lessons about life.

However, this isn't a movie which needs deep philosophical thought. It's a jolly romp which leaves the viewer feeling happy, and wanting more Nanny McPhee.",1292889600,,2034,4.8028571428571425

In this case, our Nanny is called to help a young mother with three young'uns while her husband is away.  Instead of matrimonial problems, there are gambling debts to be paid while lessons are learned.  Problem solving with McPhee is thinking outside the breadbox, in fact, this franchise in the making could be a successful parenting/problem solving seminar.  Parenting With Nanny McPhee..Magic in the Huddle (or something like that).

Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson are a good pair for the film that makes this believable, entertaining, and educational (for consequence based parenting).

4137564,2,B003L20IJW,"I had high hopes for this one, but we spent our money, ate our popcorn (well, most of it) and left the movie early.  My daughter was NOT (for the most part) entertained by this film.  She did enjoy the pigs swimming, but other than that, it did little to keep her attention.  It was as if we were watching the first Nanny movie (which is fantastic) with just a quick change in cast and setting.  There was nothing new offered that we could see, unless the last 15 minutes were earth shattering, which I doubt.

I also found it somewhat disturbing when Nanny is first introduced to the children that she uses violent tactics to get them to listen to her.  They grab their own hair and hit their heads against the wall or floor...and while I know it's Nanny's style to make kids do things they can't control, (like in the first movie when the kids were messing up the kitchen) this one had a meaner edge to it and I felt it was a bit overdone.

Sorry I can't give you better news...save your money on this one.

**Addition to Review made 6/14/11**

I have had the opportunity to view the entire film recently and wanted to add to my review.

I still believe that the scene where Nanny is first introduced to the children is a bit overdone.  The violence these children perpetrated against themselves against their will was disturbing to me.  But...I must say that overall, the movie was a success...a lesson in family, selflessness, consideration, trust and compassion.  The very end made the whole movie worthwhile.  I wanted to say that I am not sure why the movie rubbed me so wrong the first time, nor am I sure why my daughter didn't like it the first time, but she and I both enjoyed it this second time and I wanted to update my review to reflect my reconsiderations.",1284249600,8,1772,4.412307692307692
4137565,4,B003L20IJW,"I couldn't have picked a better movie. Snaggle toothed, dreadfully homely, and a wee bit of a woman that can cause even the bravest of souls to wince, McPhee is charming.  It always amazes me to watch such a beautiful actress as Emma Thompson play a character that is just so different from herself.

Beauty aside, I find that Nanny is an endearing angel that rivals even the quintessentially beautiful Mary Poppins. Sans the musical notes that dance from Julie Andrews, Emma Thompson's character provides the sane sense of ease and comfort, while teaching a horde of little demons how to behave properly.

I have to say that Emma Thompson delivers a perfect performance in this film. She's everything that a frazzled mother Mrs. Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) could wish for, especially during the trying times of World War II. Ewan McGregor plays her husband, who is off fighting the war. As often occurred during those times, he has left his young wife behind to care for the homestead and their rapscallion brood of children Norman, Megsie and Vincent. As if times weren't trying enough, the situation becomes worse when their spoiled cousins come to stay with them, escaping the Blitz.

While Mr. Green is away, his rotten brother Phil (Rhys Ifans) pressures Isabel to sell the farm to cover his own gambling debts. Five children, a frazzled mother on the brink of a nervous breakdown, and a horrid brother-in-law drives everyone to distraction.

Thus, the WWII version of Nanny 911 arrives, intent on teaching the children five valuable lessons via her own form of entrancing magic. As Nanny McPhee demonstrated in her first film, hilarity abounds, as well as life lessons that benefit the children.

Emma Thompson is magical, and her lessons to the children are filled with a patient wisdom we all could practice. My favorite part has always been the slight transformation that begins to overtake this dreadfully plain woman, making her the beauty that Thompson truly is.

I have to give this a family film 4 star, for the simple charm and magic that can hold youngsters enraptured and keep adults smiling.",1283040000,46,2115,4.924157303370786
4137566,4,B003L20IJW,"There's something about the Nanny McPhee character that appeals to me even more than Mary Poppins. I grant you that Nanny McPhee is no looker, what with her hairy warts, her snaggletooth, and her bulbous nose all glaring at you as if she were an endurance test for her clients. All the same, she knows what she's doing. Perhaps it has something to do with her magic, which doesn't serve as a vehicle for light, whimsical musical numbers; it's harsher and more direct, the kind that could conceivably subdue unruly children were it real. Under her rules, it seems plausible that a child can actually learn his or her lesson, and indeed, all the children in this film are challenged in ways that many family films wouldn't care to consider. But it's not all strict policies and firm magical consequences - with each lesson the children learn, she gets progressively less ugly, and by the end, she looks like the Emma Thompson we know and love.

""Nanny McPhee Returns,"" the sequel to the oddly charming 2005 film adapted from Christianna Brand's ""Nurse Matilda"" books, is not an equal to its predecessor; it surpasses it on just about every level, from setting to characterization to dialogue to theme, making for a film that's fun, thoughtful, and every so slightly creepy. It's not creepy in traditional, obvious ways, like you would expect from a brooding horror movie. It is, however, heightened to a state of strange otherworldliness, a place where audiences - children included - can actually see the humor in a pair of hitwomen threatening to remove a man's kidney's before deciding he should be stuffed like a dead bird. It's also a place where we feel genuine tension from the sight of children disarming a bomb that's only seconds away from detonating. In a normal universe, all this would be astoundingly inappropriate. Here, it's just right.

The plot, which shifts the setting from the nineteenth century to the days of World War II, has Nanny McPhee (Thompson) entering the lives of the Green family, who manage a farm in the British countryside. The mother, Isabel (Maggie Gyllenhaal), is at her wits end. Her three children - Norman (Asa Butterfield), Megsie (Lil Woods), and Vincent (Oscar Steer) - are constantly fighting. Her husband is off fighting in the war. Her financial situation is steadily declining. She's continuously harassed by her good-for-nothing brother-in-law, Phil (Rhys Ifans), who has secretly gambled away the farm and is desperately trying to get her to sign away her half of the ownership. She tries to make ends meet by managing a village shop, but her associate, Mrs. Docherty (Maggie Smith), is just this side of loony, making it next to impossible to keep the shop in order. Worst of all, her children's rich, spoiled, snotty cousins - Cyril (Eros Vlahos) and Celia (Rosie Taylor-Ritson) - have been sent to stay on the farm.

Nanny McPhee, with her trusty cane, can make magic happen with a bang on the floor, although not in conventional, innocent ways. To make the children stop fighting, for example, she forces them to hit, pull, and kick themselves individually, and she makes it clear that she will put an end to it only on the condition that they apologize to one another. They better hurry; more of the room is being destroyed, and letters from the Greens' father are liable to get thrown into the fire. Later on, when all five children have to work together to find a litter of prize piglets, Nanny McPhee intentionally makes it harder for them by having the pigs do what they normally cannot do, such as climb trees, jump long distances, and have them partake in a surprisingly entertaining display of synchronized swimming.

With the notable exception of Uncle Phil, that rotten excuse of a man, every character develops in harmony with the story, which is to say we learn more about them as the film progresses. As a result, no one is a one-dimensional caricature. Cyril and Celia, for example, may have lived a privileged life, but that doesn't mean they're immune to emotional turmoil, mostly the result of parents who are more interested in themselves. If they act like brats, it's only because they know no other way to receive attention. Likewise, the Green children would like nothing more than for their father to come home; they're angry that he had to leave them and their mother alone, and since they're fairly isolated from the rest of the world, they have no one to take it out on except each other. Not a single child in this movie is bad. They merely have no healthy outlet for their pent up feelings.

Hanging over the whole situation is the threat of enemy bombing, unlikely though it may be. Thompson, who also wrote the screenplay, somehow manages to take this unfortunate reality and lighten it up, not to the point of ridiculousness, but just enough for it to be engaging to a younger audience. I don't know how she managed that delicate balance between childish whimsy, maturity, and morbidity, but somehow or another, she did it. I was also impressed by her portrayal of Nanny McPhee, a no-nonsense but caring witch whose magic can make the best of any situation, no matter how desperate it may seem. ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" is a pure delight from beginning to end - charming, funny, touching, and intelligent, one of the best family films I've seen all year.",1282780800,43,5335,4.800870511425463
4137567,5,B003L20IJW,"This is a nice family film, somewhere between a 4 and 5 star, so I rounded up.  Nannie McPhee (Emma Thompson) is a strange nannie.  She is quite magical and quite delightful, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  (Of course, better to be a-head than a little behind, I always say.)

The story begins on the family farm, in the English Countryside, far from London.  It is WWII.  Isabelle and the 3 children are taking care of the farm while the husband/father is away fighting in the war.  The farm is owned by the husband and his brother Phil.  The brother lives elsewhere.

Phil wants the money from his half of the farm and is pestering the heck out of Isabelle to sell it but she is trying to hang on until her husband returns.  Meanwhile, Phil has incurred some gambling debts - actually, he bet the farm.  Two ""Hit Women"" are after Phil now, threatening to remove his kidneys.

The 2 cousins are coming from the city (London) to stay at the farm because bombs are being dropped in big cities.  Of course, there is a clash between the farm kids and the city kids from the minute the city kids step out of the limo and into the ""Land of Poo"".

There is magic in the air when Nannie McPhee shows up at the front door and quickly gets the five fighting children in line.  The animals become magical, too, including the adorable baby piglets that do ""synchronized swimming"" (like the old Esther Williams movies). There is also a bird that belches all the time and an adorable baby elephant.

Again, it's a cute film that you can enjoy with your young children.",1282435200,41,1557,4.410526315789474
